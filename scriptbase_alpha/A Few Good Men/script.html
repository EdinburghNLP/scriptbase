                                        Written by

                                       Aaron Sorkin



                                   Revised Third Draft

                                      July 15, 1991

<b>                
</b>
<b>               FADE IN:
</b>
<b>               EXT. A SENTRY TOWER --
</b>
               -- in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere.

               Small beams of light coming from lamps attached to the tower 
               cut through the ground mist. We HEAR all the unidentifiable 
               sounds of night in the woods. We also HEAR, very, very 
               faintly, a slow, deliberate drum cadence. And as this starts, 
               we begin to MOVE SLOWLY UP THE TOWER, more becomes visible 
               now:... the sandbags on the ground piled ten-high... the 
               steel, fire escape-type stairway wrapping around the structure 
               and leading to the lookout post, and finally... THE LOOKOUT 
               POST, maybe forty feet off the ground.

               Standing the post is the silhouette of A MARINE. He's holding 
               a rifle and staring straight out.

               The drum cadence has been building slightly.

<b>                                                                    CUT TO:
</b>
               A WIDER SHOT OF THE FENCELINE. And we see by the moonlight 
               that the tall wire-mesh fence winds its way far, far into 
               the distance.

</b>
               The drum cadence continues, and we

</b>
<b>               INT. A MARINE BARRACKS
</b>
               We HEAR two pairs of footsteps and then

<b>                                                                    CUT TO:
</b>
<b>               THE BARRACKS CORRIDOR
</b>
               where we see that the footsteps belong to DAWSON and DOWNEY, 
               two young marines who we'll get to know later. They stop 
               when they get to a certain door. The drum cadence is still 
               growing. DAWSON puts his hand on the doorknob and turns it 
               slowly.  He opens's the door and they walk into

<b>               INT. SANTIAGO'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               WILLY SANTIAGO, a young, very slight marine, lies asleep in 
               his bunk.

               DAWSON kneels down by the bed, puts his hand on SANTIAGO'S 
               shoulder and shakes him gently. SANTIAGO opens his yes, looks 
               at DAWSON, and for a moment there's nothing wrong --

               -- and then SANTIAGO's eyes fill with terror. He lunges out 
               of the bed -- but forget about it. In one flash DAWSON and 
               DOWNEY grab him out of bed, and before the scream can come 
               out, DOWNEY's shoved a piece of cloth into SANTIAGO's mouth.

               Everything that happens next occurs with speed, precision 
               and professionalism.

               -- A strip of duct tape is pulled, ripped, and slapped onto 
               his mouth and eyes --

               -- A length of rope is wrapped around his hands and feet.

</b>                              (quietly)
                         You're lucky it's us, Willy.

               -- An arm grabs him tightly around the neck, not choking 
               him, just holding his head still --

               -- The drum cadence has built to a crescendo. We HEAR four 
               sharp blasts from a whistle and we

</b>
<b>               EXT. THE WASHINGTON NAVY YARD - DAY

               and the drum cadence we've been hearing has turned into Semper 
               Fidelis and it's coming from THE U.S. MARINE CORPS BAND, a 
               sight to behold in their red and gold uniforms and polished 
               silver and brass.

               The BAND is performing on the huge and lush parade grounds 
               before a crowd made up mostly of TOURISTS and DAY-CAMPERS.

               As the TITLES ROLL, we watch the BAND do their thing from 
               various angles. Incredible precision is the name of the game. 
               Each polished black shoe hitting the ground as if they were 
               all attached by a rod. Each drumstick raised to the same 
               fraction of a centimeter before striking. A RIFLE DRILL TEAM 
               that can't possibly be human. Flags, banners, the works.

<b>               EXT. A RED BRICK BUILDING - DAY
</b>
               It's an important building, a main building. A few SAILORS 
               enter and exit and

               as she walks across the courtyard toward the brick building.  
               The WOMAN is JOANNE GALLOWAY, a navy lawyer in her early 
               30's. She's bright, attractive, impulsive, and has a tendency 
               to speak quickly. If she had any friends, they'd call her 
               JO. As she walks, she mutters to herself ...

                         confidence inspiring.

               We follow JO, still muttering, as she walks into the brick

                         over the weekend down in Cuba.

                         Two marines, Corporal Harold Dawson 
                         and Private Louden Downey, entered 
                         the barracks room of a PFC William 
                         Santiago and assaulted him. Santiago 
                         died at the base hospital 
                         approximately an hour later. The NIS 
                         agent who took their statements 
                         maintains they were trying to prevent 
                         Santiago from naming them in a

<b>               EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - DAY
</b>
<b>               THE RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB
</b>
               His name is LIEUTENANT JUNIOR GRADE DANIEL ALLISTAIR KAFFEE, 
               and it's almost impossible not to like him. At the moment 
               he's hitting fungoes to about a dozen LAWYERS who are spread 
               out on the softball field on a corner of the bass. The '27 
               Yankees they're not, but they could probably hold their own 
               against a group of, say, Airforce dentists.

               KAFFEE's in his late 20's, 15 months out of Harvard Law 
               School, and a brilliant legal mind waiting for a courageous 
               spirit to drive it. He is, at this point in his life, 
               passionate about nothing... except maybe softball.

<b>                                     KAFFEE

                              team)
                         Alright, let's get two!

               He smacks one to the SECOND BASE. The ball bounces right 
               between his legs.

                         Just look the ball into your glove.

               He smacks one out to the same place. It bounces off the heel 
               of SHERBY's glove and into center field.

               About 16 NAVY AND MARINE LAWYERS (several of whom are women) 
               are taking their seats around a large conference table.

               A PARALEGAL is handing out folders and some photocopied papers

                         nauseated, but on May 18th, I'd fallen 
                         back about 20 or 30 yards going down 
                         a rocky, unstable hill. My sergeant 
                         grabbed me and pushed me down the 
                         hill. Then I saw all black and the 
                         last thing I remember is hitting the 
                         deck. I was brought to the hospital 
                         where I was told I just had heat 
                         exhaustion and was explained to by 
                         the doctor that my body has trouble 
                         with the hot sun and I hyperventilate.

                         Maybe we should consider this for a

                         officers have a responsibility to 
                         train Santiago. Maybe we as officers 
                         have a responsibility to this country 
                         to see that the men and women charged 
                         with its security are trained 
                         professionals. Yes. I'm certain I 
                         once read that somewhere. And now 
                         I'm thinking that your suggestion of 
                         transferring Santiago, while 
                         expeditious, and certainly painless, 
                         might not be in a manner of speaking, 
                         the American way. Santiago stays 
                         where he is. We're gonna train the 
                         lad. You're in charge, Jon. Santiago 
                         doesn't make 4.1 on his next fitness 
                         report, I'm gonna blame you. Then

               Another red-brick building. A few M.P.Is stand out front as

               escort DAWSON and DOWNEY, in handcuffs, out of the car.  
               HAROLD DAWSON's a handsome, young, black corporal. Intense,

               LOUDEN DOWNEY's a 19-year-old kid off an Iowa farm. He's

                         won't tell anyone. But my feeling is 
                         that if this case is handled in the 
                         same fast-food, slick-ass, Persian 
                         Bazaar manner with which you seem to 
                         handle everything else, something's 
                         gonna get missed. And I wouldn't be 
                         doing my job if I allowed Dawson and 
                         Downey to spend any more time in 
                         prison than absolutely necessary, 
                         because their attorney had pre-
                         determined the path of least 
                         resistance.

               KAFFEE can't help but be impressed by that speech.

               A baby sleeping in a crib pull rack to reveal SAM is standing 
               over the crib. KAFFEE's sitting on a beer.

               The whole place, in stark contrast to the Washington Navy 
               Yard, is ready to go to war. Fighter jets line the tarmac. 
               Ground crews re-fuel planes. Hurried activity.

               A 36 seat Airforce Jet rolls to a stop on the tarmac and a 
               stair unit is brought up.

               HOWARD, a marine corporal, is waiting by the stairway as the 
               passengers begin to got off. Mostly MARINES, a few SAILORS, 
               a couple of CIVILIANS, and KAFFEE, JO and SAM. KAFFEE and 
               SAM are wearing their summer whites, JO is in khakis.

               KAFFEE and SAM stare out at what they see: They're not in 
               Kansas anymore.

                         This is really a formality more than 
                         anything else. The JAG Corps insists 
                         that I interview all the relevant

               Kaffee goes to the closet and opens it: A row of uniforms 
               hanging neatly. He thumbs through then for a second, but 
               there's nothing there.

               He opens the footlocker: Socks, underwear... all folded to

               ROSS is playing a game of full-court basketball with some

               A door at the far end of the court opens and KAFFEE and JO 
               walk in. They head down the sideline toward Ross.

               ROSS stops cold and looks over at Kaffee. The game flies by

               JO, SAM, ROSS, RANDOLPH... it's hard to say who's the most 
               surprised. It takes everything Jo's got to suppress a smile. 
               The silence is broken by ROSS, who takes the two files, drops 
               them into his briefcase, closes the lid, and snaps it shut.

               RANDOLPH looks at KAFFEE and ROSS, then turns to the SERGEANT

               to their cell.

               KAFFEE and JO and SAM are the only ones remaining. SAM is

                         platoon-mate, PFC William Santiago.  
                         They woke him up, tied his arms and 
                         legs with rope, and forced a rag 
                         into his throat. A few minutes later, 
                         a chemical reaction in Santiago's 
                         body called lactic acidosis caused 
                         his lungs to begin bleeding. He 
                         drowned in his own blood and was 
                         pronounced dead at 32 minutes past 
                         midnight. These are the facts of the 
                         case. And they are undisputed. That's 
                         right. The story I just told you is 
                         the exact same story you're going to 
                         hear from Corporal Dawson, and it's 
                         the exact same story you're going to 
                         hear from Private Downey. Furthermore, 
                         the Government will also demonstrate 
                         that the defendants soaked the rag 
                         with poison, and entered Santiago's 
                         room with motive and intent to kill.

                         Now, Lt. Kaffee, is gonna try to 
                         pull off a little magic act, he's 
                         gonna try a little misdirection. 
                         He's going to astonish you with 
                         stories of rituals and dazzle you 
                         with official sounding terms like 
                         Code Red. He might even cut into a 
                         few officers for you. He'll have no 
                         evidence, mind you, none. But it's 
                         gonna be entertaining. When we get 
                         to the end, all the magic in the 
                         world will not have been able to 
                         divert your attention from the fact 
                         that Willy Santiago is dead, and 
                         Dawson and Downey killed him. These 
                         are the facts of the case.

               Before KAFFEE's even stood up, these words are coming out of 
               his mouth.

                         there was no intent to kill and any 
                         attempt to prove otherwise is futile

                         When Dawson and Downey went into 
                         Santiago's room that night, it wasn't 
                         because of vengeance or hatred, it 
                         wasn't to kill or harm, and it wasn't 
                         because they were looking for kicks 
                         on a Friday night. It's because it 
                         was what they were ordered to do.

                         Now, out in the real world, that 
                         means nothing. And here at the

               KENDRICK's on the stand. What drives Kaffee's entire 
               examination of Kendrick is this: Kaffee's got him. He's gonna 
               win. At least this round. All he has to do is not let his 
               emotions take control of his professional skill.

               SAM will have files and documents ready to hand Kaffee as he 
               needs them.

                         Private Santiago a good marine?

                         Average I didn't see the need in

                         fitness reports you signed for Lance 
                         Corporal Dawson and PFC Downey. Downey

                         most recent report, dated June 9th 
                         of this year, he received a rating 
                         of Below Average. It's this last

                         Infantry Training School was perfect. 
                         Records indicate that over half that 
                         class has since been promoted to 
                         full corporal, while Dawson has 
                         remained a lance corporal. Was

                         the switch log has you down at Post

               it:

               "Where's he going with this?" JO scribbles "?" And hands it 
               back to KAFFEE.

                         was aware that two days ago, Captain 
                         Markinson took his own life with a 
                         .45 caliber pistol.

               And from the back of the room, SAM enters. He's escorting 
               two young AIRMEN in Airforce dress uniforms. SAM shows the 
               AIRMEN to a seat near the front, and takes his place at the 
               defense table.

               Over this we HEAR --

</b>                         The witness is aware, the Court is 
                         aware, and now the jury is aware. We 
                         thank you for bringing this to our

               SAM scribbles something on a piece of paper, KAFFEE walks 
               over, looks at the paper on which are wrttten two names: 
               Cecil O'Malley and Anthony Perez, then turns back to RANDOLPH.

                         this meeting, you gave Lt. Kendrick

                         leaving Guantanamo at six the next

                         records from GITMO for August 6th.  
                         And these are 14 letters that Santiago 
                         wrote in nine months requesting, in 
                         fact begging, for a transfer.
                              (to JESSEP)
                         Upon hearing the news that he was 
                         finally getting his transfer, Santiago 
                         was so excited, that do you know how 
                         many people he called? Zero. Nobody. 
                         Not one call to his parents saying 
                         he was coming home. Not one call to 
                         a friend saying can you pick me up 
                         at the airport. He was asleep in his 
                         bed at midnight, and according to 
                         you he was getting on a plane in six 
                         hours, yet everything he owned was 
                         hanging neatly in his closet and 
                         folded neatly in his footlocker. You 
                         were leaving for one day and you 
                         packed a bag and made three phone 
                         calls. Santiago was leaving for the 
                         rest of his life, and he hadn't called 
                         a soul and he hadn't packed a thing. 
                         Can you explain that? The fact is 
                         there was no transfer order. Santiago 
                         wasn't going anywhere, isn't that

                         he didn't have any friends. I'm an 
                         educated man, but I'm afraid I can't 
                         speak intelligently about the travel 
                         habits of William Santiago.  What I 
                         do know is that he was set to leave 
                         the base at 0600. Now are these really 
                         the questions I was called here to 
                         answer? Phone calls and footlockers? 
                         Please tell me you've got something 
                         more, Lieutenant. Please tell me 
                         there's an ace up your sleeve. These 
                         two marines are on trial for their 
                         lives. Please tell me their lawyer 
                         hasn't pinned their hopes to a phone 
                         bill.
                              (beat)
                         Do you have any other questions for 
                         me, counselor?

               The courtroom is silenced. Jessep's slammed the door.

               KAFFEE looks around the room, sees that the world is waiting 
               for him to do something...

                         find the defendants Not Guilty.

               It's hard to resist the temptation to scream and shout, but 
               they do.

                         defendants Not Guilty.

               RANDOLPH looks up. Then reads from the last slip of paper.

                         find the defendants Guilty as Charged.

               A little of the energy drains out of the room. RANDOLPH 
               continues reading.

                         This Court-Martial is adjourned.

               RANDOLPH raps his gavel.

               RANDOLPH's gone.

               The M.P.'s move to DAWSON and DOWNEY to unlock their 
               handcuffs. KAFFEE is packing up his things, just another day 
               at the office.

               SAM slaps his hands down on the table --

</b>                         Yes you did! A jury just said your 
                         conduct was unbecoming a marine. 
                         What does that mean?!

</b>                         Not anymore.

               SAM lets it hang. DAWSON is staring at SAM. His stare moves 
               slowly to the floor.

                         I never meant to hurt Willy.

               DAWSON looks up at HIS PARENTS. The moment hangs there... 
               before

                         work.

               KAFFEE nods.

               DAWSON looks to KAFFEE. There's gotta be more. This can't be 
               it.

               But KAFFEE has nothing to say.

               DAWSON and DOWNEY walk to the SERGEANT AT ARMS and begin to 
               follow him up the aisle and out of the courtroom. But before 
               they get to the door, KAFFEE turns around and calls

               They stop and turn around.

                         your arm to have honor.

               DAWSON stares at KAFFEE for a long moment.

<b>                                     DAWSON

               DAWSON and DOWNEY come to attention.

                         There's an officer on deck.

               DAWSON snaps a salute and holds it.

               KAFFEE stares back. Then stands up straight and returns their 
               salute.

               With one last glance back at KAFFEE, DAWSON turns and walks 
               out the door, followed by DOWNEY.

               ROSS walks over to the defense table.
