</b>                                           Revised April 16th, 2009
<b>
</b><b>
</b><b>1   EXT. SMITH STREET STATION -- BROOKLYN -- NIGHT                 1
</b><b>
</b>    It's very late. It's quiet. Just the sounds of The City
<b>
</b>    LINDA SANTANA CRAIG, an attractive Hispanic woman in her
    thirties, waits at the ELEVATED STATION for the F train.
<b>
</b>    Linda looks great. She's dressed festively but tastefully.
    Next to her is her eleven year old DAUGHTER, ALICIA. She is
    twirling about the platform, still jazzed from the birthday
    party they attended in The City.
<b>
</b>    Alicia wears a black dress with a pink cardigan and has a pink
    handbag. We notice a CHARM BRACELET with four-leaf clovers on
    her right wrist.
<b>
</b>    The mother and daughter wait alone at one end of the station
    platform.
<b>
</b>    TWO TEENAGE BOYS wait at the other end. They speak soft,
    SLURRED SPANISH to each other.
<b>
</b>    Linda gives the boys a glance and evaluates. She watches them
    as Alicia spits a wad of gum into her mom's open hand.
<b>
</b>    The Boys approach. Linda tenses. At the last second the boys
    make a hard left turn and disappear down the stairwell. It's
    quiet again. Linda relaxes, smiles at her daughter. The F
    TRAIN is rounding the final bend into the station.
<b>
</b>    Their focus is on this train. It's getting closer, louder.
<b>
</b>    And so they don't see, don't hear the Boys coming back up the
    stairwell behind them.
<b>
</b>    Not until the boys have the mother and daughter boxed in and
    the one who can hardly grow a mustache is showing them his
    gun.
<b>
</b>    Linda puts her arm around her daughter. Alicia looks
    terrified.
<b>
</b>    The train roars INTO THE STATION as Linda quickly hands over
    her purse, her watch. She hands over her engagement ring and
    her wedding band.
<b>
</b>    One of the boys yanks Alicia's little purse away from her.
<b>
</b>    The other boy fumbles the wedding band. The ring CLANGS to
    the ground and rolls to a stop a few feet away.
<b>
</b>    We hear MEN'S VOICES echoing up the stairwell.
<b>
</b>    Now the Boys are boxed in. And starting to panic.
<b>                                                                2.
</b><b>
</b><b>
</b><b>    -- THE TRAIN DOORS SLIDE OPEN --.
</b><b>
</b>    The Boys see their way out and step into the last empty rail
    car, leaving the mother and daughter alone on the platform.
<b>
</b>    Through the window on the train, Linda stares at the boy
    holding her daughter's purse, her face hardening into a MASK
<b>    OF CONTEMPT.
</b><b>
</b>    The boy clocks it. Who does she think she is?
<b>
</b><b>    -- THE TRAIN DOORS BEGIN TO CLOSE --
</b><b>
</b>    When a HAND WITH TATTOOED KNUCKLES reaches out and stops the
    car doors from closing.
<b>
</b>    A forearm and gun extend out of that last subway car ...
    There's a muzzle flash... a distant POP... a cloud of smoke
    ... a mist of blood... and Linda's body collapses on itself.
<b>
</b>    Alicia's face, shock, terror and blood.
<b>
</b><b>
</b><b>2   EXT. SMITH STREET STATION -- LATER THAT NIGHT --   M.O.S        2
</b><b>
</b>    A WORKING CRIME SCENE, lots of uniforms and light, a white
    sheet draped over Linda's body where it fell.
<b>
</b>    BLUE AND RED LIGHT dances against the stairwell wall where a
    man is taking the stairs two at a time. Late thirties, big,
    plain clothes, he is SERGEANT JAMES CRAIG. When he reaches
    the platform, he stops.
<b>
</b>    Craig kneels before the white sheet. Peels it back. We stay
    on him. We don't see what he sees. We just see how he sees
    it. Then he turns...
<b>
</b>    THE WEDDING BAND. It's been tagged and numbered as evidence.
    Craig picks it right out of the chalk outline and slips it
    into his pocket.
<b>
</b>    Alicia, wrapped in a blanket, standing next to a round police
    MATRON. The Matron is tenderly trying to clean Alicia's face.
    Alicia locks eyes with Craig and stumbles towards him, her
    legs not quite working.
<b>
</b>    Craig saves her from the stumble and envelops her, lifting
    her as the blanket falls to the ground.
<b>
</b>    Alicia makes little gasping noises. Trying to speak but
    can't.
<b>
</b>    Craig walking back now, carrying his entire world. He reaches
    the stairwell and suddenly falls to one knee. Alicia gasps.
<b>                                                                3.
</b><b>
</b><b>
</b>    The closest UNIFORM puts a hand on his arm. A moment.
    Composure. A deep breath. Then as quickly as he went down,
    he's back up.
<b>
</b>    Craig looks back now, taking it all in. Is it real? Sees all
    the cops looking at him, then begins down the stairs.
<b>
</b>    WE DRIFT UP above the station until we find ourselves with a
    clear view of the southern tip of Manhattan, where the TWIN
<b>    TOWERS STAND TALL.
</b><b>
</b><b>
</b><b>3   INT. LOWER EAST SIDE RAILROAD FLAT -- BEDROOM -- MORNING        3
</b><b>
</b>    SUBTITLE: "Eight Years Later"
<b>
</b>    Tiny kitchen, clutter, a MESSENGER BIKE hanging from hooks on
    the wall, a lot of books. There is a PHONE RINGING under the
    bed.
<b>
</b>    TYLER ROTH, early twenties, handsome, looking haggard. He is
    sitting on the floor, shirtless, bed head, wrapped in a
    blanket. A GUITAR is on his lap. Tyler has propped some well
    worn, hand written pages of MUSIC against a box of off-brand
    laundry detergent and is squinting at the notes, frustration
    etched in his face.
<b>
</b>    A forgettable BLONDE lies sleeping on the bed.
<b>
</b>    Tyler, not a born musician, is trying to teach himself one of
    the PHRASES OF MUSIC in front of him. He is completely lost
    in the moment, with DEEP GROOVES in his fingers. By the
    ASHTRAY next to him, we can tell he's been at this a couple
    of hours.
<b>
</b>    The Blonde in the bed re: the ringing phone...
<b>
</b><b>                        BLONDE
</b>                  (out of it)
              Hello?
<b>
</b>    Tyler gropes around the floor with one hand until he finds the
    phone, simultaneously glancing at the digital clock. His eyes
    widen in alarm.
<b>
</b><b>                        TYLER
</b>              Yeah...
                  (listens)
              Of course. I'm on my way. I
              know...I know...I know...I know.
<b>
</b>    Tyler climbs out of his blanket and yanks on a pair of dark
    suit pants. Before he pulls on his white undershirt we
    observe a TATTOO that simply says "Michael" over his heart.
<b>                                                                 4.
</b><b>
</b><b>
</b>    He searches through a beat-up chest of drawers, seeking a
    reasonably clean button down shirt...
<b>
</b><b>                        TYLER V/O
</b>              Gandhi said that whatever you do in
              life will be insignificant but it
              is very important that you do it...
<b>
</b>    ...And scrubs at a mysterious stain on the shoulder of an
    expensive but worn to hell suit jacket with a dishwasher
    brush.
<b>
</b><b>                        TYLER V/O
</b>              ...I tend to agree with the first
              part.
<b>
</b><b>
</b><b>4   EXT. GREEN WOOD CEMETERY --BROOKLYN -- LATER                     4
</b><b>
</b>    A cluster of MOURNERS stand before a tombstone in the
    distance. They are not in funeral dress, as this is not a
    funeral. It's a memorial.
<b>
</b>    A beat up GYPSY CAB with a WEST INDIAN DRIVER pulls to a
    stop. From the trees and the sky we know its LATE
    SPRING/EARLY SUMMER. A gorgeous day.
<b>
</b>    Tyler gets out of the cab, holding the rim of his empty
    coffee cup in his teeth. He sorts a rumpled wad of singles
    and hands some to the driver, who screeches into reverse.
    Time is money.
<b>
</b>    Tyler crushes the coffee cup flat and slips it in his jacket
    pocket then lights up a smoke. He takes one long drag then
    extinguishes it and slips the butt into his pocket. He begins
    towards the mourners.
<b>
</b>    His mother... DIANE HOFFMAN, a beauty. Past burdens etched in
    the lines on her face. Dressed tastefully in expensive
    bohemian. She smiles like someone who's been crying but
    doesn't want anyone to know she has.
<b>
</b><b>                        TYLER
</b>                  (sweetly)
              Hello, your majesty. How are you?
<b>
</b><b>                        DIANE
</b>              I'm fine... you look good...
<b>
</b>    He kisses his mother's hand and he's moving to greet his
    stepfather...
<b>
</b>    LES HOFFMAN, Unruly curls streaked in gray, tweed jacket and
    tie. They exchange a firm handshake and muttered hellos.
<b>                                                              5.
</b><b>
</b><b>
</b>    The weight of Tyler's gaze falls to CAROLINE ROTH, his
    diminutive bespectacled, eleven year old sister. She's
    holding a little paper bag.
<b>
</b>    She flashes him a look. He kneels besides her and whispers...
<b>
</b><b>                        TYLER
</b>              Thanks for organizing everybody.
<b>
</b>    Caroline makes a face. Turns her nose away from him.
<b>
</b><b>                        CAROLINE
</b>              You smell like Listerine and beer.
<b>
</b>    He snorts and kisses her cheek.
<b>
</b>    Caroline reaches into her bag and takes out a handful of
    smooth white stones, on which she has painted the names:
    "Mom" "Tyler" "Les", "Dad", "Caroline". She begins to arrange
    them in a little circle on the grave.
<b>
</b>    Tyler's father...
<b>
</b>    CHARLES ROTH, late fifties, breathes power, precisely
    dressed, two hundred dollar haircut. A predator.
<b>
</b><b>                        CHARLES
</b>                  (aside, to Tyler)
              You couldn't wear a tie?
<b>
</b>    Tyler holds his father's eye.
<b>
</b><b>                        TYLER
</b>              Could have.
<b>
</b>    Beat.
<b>
</b>    Charles adjusts his own collar like it's an explosive.
<b>
</b>    POV: The Tombstone. The four adult family members stand side-
    by-side. They look like strangers on the subway as Caroline
    sits on the ground, arranging the stones.
<b>
</b><b>
</b><b>5   INT. JUNIOR'S RESTAURANT-- BROOKLYN -- AFTER                  5
</b><b>
</b>    The family sits together in a booth. Tyler rolls a Bic
    lighter over his knuckles. Caroline draws a funny portrait of
    Tyler on her napkin. He is smoking nine cigarettes at once.
    Diane gives the menu a ridiculous amount of attention. Les is
    eyeing the Cheesecake. Charles subtly aligns his silverware.

probably use it someday remains.

<b>
</b><b>                         MEGAN
</b>               Do. Not. Speak.
<b>
</b>     Tyler snorts with laughter.
<b>
</b><b>                         AIDAN
</b>                   (genuine)
               Is she mad at me or something?
<b>
</b><b>                         TYLER

               they're way into you.
<b>
</b><b>                            AIDAN
</b>               Oh.
<b>
</b>     Two nubile young GIRLS approach Aidan. Tap his shoulder.
<b>
</b><b>                            GIRL #1
</b>               Excuse me?
<b>                                                                 16.
</b><b>
</b><b>
</b>     Aidan flashes a winning smile.
<b>
</b><b>                         AIDAN
</b>               Well, hello...
<b>
</b><b>                         GIRL #1
</b>               Could you take a picture for us?
<b>
</b>     She holds out her camera. Aidan hesitates, then smiles.
<b>
</b><b>                         AIDAN
</b>               My pleasure...
<b>
</b>     The girls pose. Aidan takes the camera. Turns it around.
     Extends it. Smiles. And promptly SNAPS A PICTURE OF HIMSELF.
     He casually returns the camera to the confused young woman.
<b>
</b>     Megan returns and practically flings the beers at Aidan.
<b>
</b><b>                         AIDAN
</b>               Thanks. You've met my roommate...
<b>
</b><b>                         MEGAN
</b>               I hope you die.
<b>
</b>     Tyler laughs his ass off.
<b>
</b><b>                         TYLER

</b><b>15   EXT. GREENWICH STREET -- LATE NIGHT                          15
</b><b>
</b>     Tyler and Aidan stand with the girls from Aidan's photo
     opportunity. All are thoroughly intoxicated. There is a knot
     of CLUB GOERS halfway down the block, drinking and having a
     fine time.
<b>
</b><b>                         AIDAN
</b>               I love this street. I love this

</b><b>                         AIDAN
</b>               Miami. Miami, Barcelona, Rio. New
               York is it, man. God broke the mold
               when he made this city.
<b>                                                          17.
</b><b>
</b><b>
</b><b>                    TYLER
</b>          You ever actually been to any of
          those places?
<b>
</b><b>                    AIDAN
</b>          What's your point?
<b>
</b>There's a gust of wind. Aidan's girl shivers. She's wearing a
tiny dress.
<b>
</b><b>                    AIDAN'S GIRL
</b>          What are we doing? I'm freezing.
<b>
</b><b>                    AIDAN
</b>          Shoulda worn a jacket. Like me.
<b>
</b>O/S WE HEAR: a beer bottle crashing on the ground, and from
far away a ghostly, plaintive girl's voice disappearing into
the night...
<b>
</b><b>                    VOICE O/S
</b>          Michael...Mi-i-chael!
<b>
</b>Tyler turns towards the sound. It's as if he's trying to spot
a train in the distance. His hand goes to his pocket and
fishes out his pack of cigarettes.
<b>
</b><b>                    AIDAN'S GIRL
</b>              (to Aidan)
          Asshole.
<b>
</b>She walks away, looking back at her friend, annoyed.
<b>
</b><b>                    AIDAN'S GIRL
</b>          Are you coming?
<b>
</b>Tyler's Girl looks at Tyler, who is still preoccupied.
<b>
</b><b>                    TYLER'S GIRL
</b>              (to her friend)
          Hold on, Lauren.
<b>
</b>The girls step away. Tyler's Girl appears to be trying to
convince her friend to stay. Aidan watches them, hopefully.
<b>
</b>Tyler isn't watching them. He's watching two cool looking
MUSICIANS, crossing the street with the LIGHT, carrying SOUND
<b>EQUIPMENT.
</b><b>
</b>A quartet of NEANDERTHALS pulls up at the light in front of
them in a car, aggressive music playing. The Neanderthal at
the wheel has the brilliant idea to rev his engine and lurch
the car forward, startling the musicians, toying with them.
<b>                                                         18.
</b><b>
</b><b>
</b>MUSICIAN #1 glares, but gives no further response, he just
wants to get across the street. The Neanderthal revs and
lurches again.
<b>
</b>MUSICIAN #2 slams his hand on the hood of the car.
<b>
</b><b>                    MUSICIAN#2
</b>          What's your problem?
<b>
</b><b>                    NEANDERTHAL DRIVER
</b>          My problem? Keep your hands off my
          car, asshole.
<b>
</b><b>                    MUSICIAN#2
</b>          Blow it out your ass, Guido.
<b>
</b><b>                    MUSICIAN#1
</b>          Go back to Long Island.
<b>
</b>The car's four doors open, and the Neanderthals lope to the
front of the car. The driver is holding a mini baseball bat
at his side.
<b>
</b><b>                    NEANDERTHAL DRIVER
</b>          I'm from Queens, faggot
<b>
</b>A Neanderthal shoves one of the musicians, and the driver
starts wailing on the other with the bat. Tyler watches as
the Neanderthals overpower them. The altercation has turned
into a full on assault. The Musicians are getting stomped
into the pavement.
<b>
</b><b>                    TYLER'S GIRL
</b>          So we were thinking we could go...
<b>
</b>Tyler walks right past the girl without even looking at her.
<b>
</b><b>                    AIDAN
</b>              (under his breath)
          God damn it.
<b>
</b>Aidan runs off after Tyler.
<b>
</b>Tyler jumps fully into the thick of it, swinging, grabbing
the beefiest Neanderthal in a choke hold and pounding the
guy's face. He fights like a pit bull. Not feeling, not
stopping.
<b>
</b>Aidan gets punched in the face. Tyler elbows the nose of the
guy who punched Aidan and it spurts blood. Then someone hits
Tyler in the gut, and he doubles over and takes a knee to the
chin. The musicians get back to their feet and fight back.
It's a brawl.
<b>                                                                19.
</b><b>
</b><b>
</b>     Aidan's girl is screaming for the cops. Tyler's girl,
     following the instincts of the inebriated, has teetered near
     enough to the brawl to imperil herself.
<b>
</b>     A Neanderthal swings at Aidan and misses, grazing the girl.
     She jerks away in her high heels and crashes to the pavement,
     splitting her lip on impact. Tyler head butts the guy.
<b>
</b><b>
</b><b>16   EXT. SIDE STREET -- LATER                                   16
</b><b>
</b>     An AMBULANCE and TWO E.M.T.'S are on site.
<b>
</b>     THE COMBATANTS from the brawl are lined up on the curb.
<b>
</b>     SERGEANT JAMES CRAIG, a little older and heavier than when we
     first met him at the train station, is standing with the
     Girl, who is a mess. Her nose bloody, her dress torn.
<b>
</b>     Craig shields the Girl with his body, listening carefully to
     her and her friend as the two girls GESTURE ANGRILY at the
     Neanderthals. Craig's eyes flicker in the same direction.
<b>
</b>     Craig's PARTNER, LEO, AFRICAN AMERICAN, a few years younger,
     is on the radio to Dispatch.
<b>
</b>     Craig snaps his fingers at one of the E.M.T.'s and receives a
     blanket, which he carefully wraps around the girl. Then, to
     his partner, indicating Tyler and Aidan...
<b>
</b><b>                         CRAIG
</b>               Cut those two loose.
<b>
</b>     Leo puts down the handset and uncuffs the guys.
<b>
</b><b>                         LEO
</b>                   (quiet)
               Take a walk.
<b>
</b>     Tyler takes a beat, looking at the lineup. Aidan, rubbing his
     wrists, gestures "Let's go". Tyler looks at the bloodied Girl
     and...
<b>
</b>     Craig, going through the pockets of Neanderthal #1.
<b>
</b><b>                         CRAIG
</b>               Anything in here that's going to
               stab me, Einstein?
<b>
</b>     Craig finds a packet, or a vial.
<b>
</b><b>                         CRAIG
</b>               Nice. You like to get high and hit
               women?
<b>                                                            20.
</b><b>
</b><b>
</b>Aidan gives Tyler's elbow a gentle tug. Tyler's caught up in
the action.
<b>
</b><b>                    NEANDERTHAL#1
</b>          I don't even know the bitch.
<b>
</b>Rage flickers across Craig's face.
<b>
</b>Craig moves down the line to one of the musicians, going
through their pockets.
<b>
</b><b>                    CRAIG
</b>          How about you two?
<b>
</b>Tyler, compelled, drawing closer to the action.
<b>
</b><b>                    MUSICIAN#1
</b>          It wasn't us, man!
<b>
</b><b>                    NEANDERTHAL#1

</b><b>                    CRAIG

          downtown.
<b>
</b>Tyler steps forward, interrupting...
<b>
</b><b>                    TYLER
</b>          It wasn't them.
<b>
</b>Aidan, who has been edging away, jerks around to his friend.
<b>
</b><b>                    AIDAN

          Tyler...

<b>
</b><b>                    TYLER
</b>          Hey!
<b>
</b>Craig, big angry Irish cop, turns to Tyler.
<b>                                                         21.
</b><b>
</b><b>
</b><b>                    TYLER
</b>          They didn't do anything. They
          didn't start this. Those assholes
          did. Why do these guys have to go
          downtown?
<b>
</b><b>                    CRAIG
</b>          What are you still doing here?
<b>
</b><b>                    TYLER
</b>          This is bullshit. It was those
          gorillas who started this.
<b>
</b>Craig moves slowly toward Tyler and starts going through
Tyler's pockets, roughly. He finds his wallet. Starts rifling
through.
<b>
</b><b>                    CRAIG
</b>          Well, Mr. Roth. What makes you
          think I give a shit?
<b>
</b><b>                    TYLER
</b>          You're a police officer. You're
          supposed to.
<b>
</b>What the hell? Craig looks from the guy he was frisking to
Tyler's girl, wrapped in a blanket. She spits blood. He turns
a bit to Tyler.
<b>
</b><b>                    CRAIG
</b>          It's a great relief to me, Mr.
          Roth, to know that you're on top of
          the situation. Now go the fuck
          home.
<b>
</b>He turns back to work.
<b>
</b>Tyler looks briefly at Aidan. Aidan looks desperate "Please!
Let's get out of here!"
<b>
</b>Tyler TOUCHES CRAIG'S ELBOW.
<b>
</b>Aidan's jaw drops. Leo takes several silent steps in. Craig
looks at his own elbow then looks at Tyler. The kid must be
out of his mind.
<b>
</b><b>                    TYLER
</b>          How about you do your job?
<b>
</b>SLAM. Craig takes Tyler's legs out, driving his face into the
pavement, a GASH opens above Tyler's LEFT EYE. Tyler lies
there dazed and disoriented as Craig, with one knee on
Tyler's neck, crushes his face into the ground. He slaps the
cuffs on.

     Everybody looks like shit. Tyler sits on a bench in the

     mug and gets into the passenger seat. She hands him his
     English muffin, which he holds in his mouth as he starts the
     car.

     makeup.

     English Club chairs, green baize on the walls. A RECEPTIONIST

</b>     Tyler in the same booth, surrounded by a commotion of
     businessmen and women. He's writing in his Journal, his foot
     tapping fast. We see the very act of writing eases him,
     loosening his strangled grip on the pen, slowing down the
     manic rhythm of his foot.

     CLUSTER OF 6TH GRADE GIRLS. One of them dips her head towards
     Caroline's ear, as if to share a secret. Whatever she says
     makes Caroline's face crumble, almost to tears, and the girls
     snicker.

</b>     Tyler hops from his perch on a parked car. His bike leans on
     a fire hydrant.

</b>     Tyler turns on the shower and tosses Ally into the water. She
     dances to avoid the stream. Ally grabs the portable shower
     head and turns it at him.

</b>     Tyler jumps into the tub to avoid the spray. They wrestle for
     the shower head.

</b>     CRACK! He hits her, hard, open hand, from across the width of
     his body. Ally is knocked off balance and hits her head on
     the cabinets.
<b>
</b><b>                         CRAIG
</b>               Ally!
<b>
</b>     His face is contorted with panic and shame.
<b>
</b>     Ally's disoriented. Her ears are ringing. Her lip is split. A
     knot is starting to form where she hit her head.
<b>
</b>     She straightens herself up and stares at her dad like she has
     no idea who he is.
<b>
</b>     Beat.
<b>
</b>     Craig tries to envelop her. With a guttural snarl she pushes
     him away, getting a little bit of blood on his shirt. She
     scrambles up the stairs.

     a few old beach chairs, a stereo, a weight bench. Aidan works
     out with an old set of dumb bells. Tyler sits on a beach
     chair, trying again with the guitar.

</b>     Aidan lifts. It's too heavy and falls to his chest. Tyler
     forgoes his spotting duty, lets him struggle. Aidan strains.

     his chest.

     has slept in one of Tyler's button down shirts.

     sits on the edge of the bed. Ally is on top. She kisses his
     neck. Suddenly, Tyler throws her to the bed. He takes
     control. Ally's momentarily taken aback, but doesn't stop
     him. There's noticeable aggression to their love-making.

</b><b>
</b>     In the midst of everything, the pair slow almost to stopping,
     a caesura. They stare into each other in a moment of surprise
     and recognition.

</b>     Then again. Young, hungry, aggressive.

</b>     They lie, eyes closed, almost asleep, entwined with each
     other. Tyler gives a little sound of contentment. Ally, in
     her own haze, reaches for him, her hair all over the place.
     Eyes still closed they fumble for each other, starting, in
     this dream state, to make love all over again.

     he smokes a cigarette and watches the sky just starting to
     brighten.

<b>
</b>     Ally lies on the couch. Curled in a blanket. A cup of hot tea
     in hand. She sips it. It stings her lip a little.

<b>
</b><b>                     TYLER
</b>           This one was our place... Michael's
           and mine. We had breakfast there
           all the time ... Maybe not as many
           times as I think we did. But enough
           times. Anyway we ate there that
           morning. It was the last place I
           saw him.
<b>
</b><b>                     ALLY

</b><b>                     TYLER
</b>           Maybe. Sometimes. I don't know. But
           I guess I wanted to tell him about
           you.
<b>
</b>Ally is moved, you can see it in her eyes, but she chooses
not to overdo it. She flips through the journal. She hands it
back to him. Then out of nowhere.
<b>
</b><b>                     ALLY

<b>
</b>He does.
<b>
</b><b>                     ALLY

               belligerent psychotic, he's not...I
               don't know, it's just recently, he
               seems really...
<b>
</b>     She looks at Tyler's face. His eyes are so patient.
<b>
</b>     Ally tears up.
<b>
</b><b>                         ALLY

<b>
</b>     Tyler strokes her hair.
<b>
</b><b>                         ALLY
</b>               I don't feel like that, though. I
               feel like I'm getting stronger and
               like I'm leaving him behind to swim
               in it all by himself.

     Holding her and kissing her hair.

</b>     Tyler is sitting at the table in the darkened room with Ally
     standing behind him with her hands over his eyes.
<b>
</b>     Caroline enters from the kitchen carrying Tyler's BIRTHDAY
     CAKE. She has obviously decorated it herself. She has drawn
     (as best as she could, given the medium) the characters from
     the ALICE statue in frosting.
<b>
</b>     It reads "A VERY MERRY UNBIRTHDAY TO YOU", and has "22" in
     numerical candles and "+ 1 TO UNGROW ON" written next to
     that.

</b><b>
</b>     She's singing. Aidan, Ally, Diane are all singing.
<b>
</b>     There's a flash from a camera off screen. It's Les.
<b>
</b>     Caroline puts the cake down in front of her brother and Ally
     takes her hands away just as they finish the song.
<b>
</b>     Tyler's face in the candlelight as he sees Caroline's

</b>     Caroline's working on a PORTRAIT OF TYLER ON A PARK BENCH,

               and I would go to museums to cool
               down... she loved them all but The

     Diane kissing, Tyler on the park bench).
<b>
</b>     Caroline sits on a catering table, Tyler next to her. She
     looks miserable, he looks furious. Diane bustles over with a

</b>     Charles in a meeting with several SUBORDINATES. Everyone is

     pulling an all-nighter. The door to the office flies open.

               on your bike for Christ's sake. You
               have to take care of nothing. You
               are responsible for no one. You're
               a kid. You think you're the first
               one to lose anything? Do you think
               that there is anything you feel

               rest of your children are going to
               hang themselves on your watch.
<b>
</b>     Charles goes, snarling, for his son, and Tyler is more than
     willing.
<b>
</b>     Janine and one of the Subordinates get between them.
<b>
</b><b>                         JANINE
</b>               Stop! Stop!
<b>
</b>     The men are pulled apart. Tyler is white and trembling with
     rage. Charles' face is completely dark and closed.

     frozen in the ancient freezer. There's got to be six inches
     of frost in there. She starts stabbing it with a wooden
     spoon. As she hears the door, she turns and puts on her most
     blistering attitude like an overcoat. As Tyler walks into the

     eyes widen...

     her see his face. She pushes at his hair, trying to see and
     understand. He kisses her, so she won't see. Tyler is
     completely lost in the storm and Alicia Santana Craig is
     going to get him through.

Craig's partner Leo, in plain clothes.
<b>
</b><b>                    AIDAN
</b>          Inuit. In-u-it, Ally. Try not to

          doing it, I couldn't get this
          little, like, song out of my

<b>
</b>He begins to bob his head to a rhythm.
<b>
</b><b>                    AIDAN
</b>          "Inuit, bum buh bum, I'm banging an
          Inuit, bum buh bum buh bum..."
<b>
</b>Ally and Tyler collapse in laughter as Craig's Partner passes
He notices Ally immediately. She doesn't see him. He takes a
long look at Tyler as he follows his wife and kids into the
next car.
<b>
</b><b>                    ALLY

</b>The train makes a stop at Patchogue. Leo and family
disembark.

</b>     Tyler, his bag on his shoulder, returning home, fishing in

</b>     His front door is unlocked.
<b>
</b>     Tyler freezes. Takes a beat. Scans the room, silently
     dropping his bag. He reaches behind him for the aluminium bat
     against the door. Wielding it, he takes two steps into the
     apartment.
<b>
</b>     Craig, in plain clothes, sitting on Tyler's bed, amidst the
     carnage of Tyler's stuff. He has been rifling through
     everything. The guitar is propped haphazardly against the

</b>Craig's face, like his wife's so many years ago, is pure
contempt. With his body at this angle, Tyler can now see his
gun.

</b>Craig closes the distance.
<b>
</b>From Tyler's P.O.V he looks like a freight train.
<b>
</b>In a flash, he gets Tyler in a choke hold, flips him on his
back on the bed and puts his hands around Tyler's throat.

</b>Silence, except for exertion.

eye. His face is starting to turn colors.

     together. His gun visible at his waistband.

</b>     Tyler's coughing, his face still red, his eyes travel briefly
     to the bat, then to Craig.

</b>     Craig closes his eyes, very briefly, then rises. Not looking
     at Tyler.

     fighting sleep. A losing battle, she's exhausted. Her lids
     finally shutter to the sound of her brother's voice.

</b>      Tyler steps into his father's empty office. It's dark, quiet.
      He opens the blinds. Sunlight fills the room.

</b><b>
</b>      Tyler walks around the office. Picking things up, putting
      them back.
<b>
</b>      Tyler sits at his father's desk in his executive chair. He
      leans back. Puts his feet up and his hands behind his head.
<b>
</b>      Tyler notices the COMPUTER. He turns on the monitor and puts
      his hand on the mouse - but doesn't move it. His hand just
      stops and stays perfectly still. Tyler stares at the monitor
      where his dad's SCREEN SAVER is scrolling through PHOTOS...
<b>
</b>      These photos are all of his FAMILY... "Michael's first
      Christmas, Tyler's eighth birthday, Diane in the hospital
      with Caroline in a pink blanket, Charles and his kids build a
      sand castle at the shore"... they just keep going.

</b>      That line of luxury cars dropping their daughters off.
      Charles' Town car rolls to a stop. Caroline gives him a kiss
      on the cheek. It registers, sort of. She gets out. Charles
      watches her all the way into the school.
<b>
</b>      His DRIVER sees him watching Caroline in the rear view
      mirror.
<b>
</b>      Charles gives the Driver a look "you're waiting for an
      invite?"
<b>
</b>      The Driver peels out.

<b>
</b>      Janine walks around the desk in time to see a photo of Tyler
      and Michael naked in the tub pop up. She smiles.

      windows separated by columns. He stares out at mid town and a
      perfect blue sky. Janine looks befuddled.

      reveal that Tyler is standing in a window on the...

</b>      A moment of still perfect silence. The Towers. The blue sky.
