DAWN OF
THE DEAD
(The working draft 1977)
by George A. Romero


1     We see the face of a young woman. She is asleep. It is very
     quiet at first, as credits appear. The woman's face begins to
     twitch, as though she is having a bad dream. She moans slightly
     and her expression grows more desperate.

     A mix of subtle sounds begin to fade in. As they get louder, we
     can discern what sounds like a busy office area. It is actually
     a frantic television studio with the hum of panic in a national
     emergency.

     The woman's moans get louder and more desperate as the
     background sounds reach full volume and the credits stop. The
     woman sits up, snapping awake.

2     She lurches forwards into the arms of a strong young man. She is
     Francine, twenty three years old and very attractive, although
     she is gritty with dirt. Her hair is hanging, dishevelled and
     sweaty. Her jeans and blouse have been worn for several days.

     She is sitting on the floor, where she has slept the last
     several hours, covered by an old overcoat.

     Tony:     YOU OK?

     Fran stares at the young man. She is shaking. She doesn't speak.

     Tony:     THE SHIT'S REALLY HITTING THE FAN.

     The girl tries to clear her head as the young man moves on to
     where others sleep on the floor. He wakes them up one at a time.
     We begin to hear voices over the busy hum of the studio. They
     have an electronic tinniness, as broadcast over a monitor. Fran
     looks about. She is still shaken from her dream.

3     We see the television studio. Reporters buzz about madly.
     Everybody looks dishevelled and exhausted. Technicians man
     monitors, and we see people on the little screens, arguing
     emotionally.

4     Voice:     WHAT'S MAKING IT HAPPEN? WHAT THE HELL
               DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE, WHAT'S MAKING IT
               HAPPEN.

     Voice:     YES, BUT THAT'S...

     Voice:     THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER STUDY. THEY'RE TRYING...

     Voice:     BUT IF WE KNEW THAT, WE COULD...

     Voice:     WE DON'T KNOW THAT! WE DON'T KNOW THAT!
               WE'VE GOTTA OPERATE ON WHAT WE DO KNOW!

5     The room is pandemonium. People run in with wire copy; others
     organise the stacks of bulletins as they arrive. Others trip
     over cables and generally get in each other's way.

6     Francine stares at the madness, still trying to clear her head.

     Man's voice: I'M STILL DREAMING.

     Fran turns her head. Another young man sits next to her on the
     floor. He is one of the ones Tony awakened.

     Fran:     NO YOU'RE NOT.

     Woman:     MY TURN WITH THE COAT.

     Fran looks up. A young woman is offering her coffee in a paper
     cup. She is next in line for the overcoat and a few hours sleep.
     Fran takes the coffee and struggles to her feet.

     Woman:     THE GUYS ON THE CREW ARE GETTING CRAZY.
               A BUNCH OF 'EM FLEW THE COOP ALREADY.
               I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER WE'LL BE ABLE
               TO STAY ON AIR.

7     Fran staggers over to the control consoles. The technicians are
     at the end of their ropes.

     Technicians: (all at once)
               WATCH CAMERA TWO...WHO THE HELL'S ON CAMERA
               TWO, A BLIND MAN...
               WATCH THE FRAME...WATCH THE FRAME...
               ROLL THE RESCUE STATIONS AGAIN.

     Technicians: WE GOT A REPORT THAT HALF THOSE RESCUE
               STATIONS HAVE BEEN KNOCKED OUT.
               SO GET ME A NEW LIST.
               SURE, I'LL PULL IT OUTA MY ASS.

     Fran focuses on the monitors. She is incredulous... stunned by
     the madness which surrounds her. She realises the hopelessness
     of the situation as she zeroes in on the televised conversation.

8     We begin to listen over the din of the news room.

     TV Man 1:    I DON'T BELIEVE THAT, DOCTOR, AND I DON'T
               BELIEVE...

     TV Man 2:    DO YOU BELIEVE THE DEAD ARE RETURNING TO
               LIFE?

     TV Man 1:    I'M NOT SO...

     TV Man 2:    DO YOU BELIEVE THE DEAD ARE RETURNING TO
               LIFE AND ATTACKING THE LIVING?

     TV Man 1:    I'M NOT SO SURE WHAT TO BELIEVE DOCTOR!

9     Suddenly we cut into the studio, and we see the argument as it
     is being shot.

     TV Man 1:    (con't)
               ALL WE GET IS WHAT YOU PEOPLE TELL US.
               AND IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO BELIEVE...

     TV Man 2:    IT'S FACT... IT'S FACT...

     TV Man 1:    IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO BELIEVE WITHOUT YOU
               COMING IN HERE AND TELLING US WE HAVE TO
               FORGET ALL HUMAN DIGNITY AND...

     TV Man 2:    HUMAN DIG... YOU CAN'T...

     TV Man 1:    ...FORGET ALL HUMAN DIGNITY...

     TV Man 2:    YOU'RE NOT RUNNING A TALK SHOW HERE, MR.
               BERMAN...YOU CAN FORGET PITCHING AN AUDIENCE
               THE MORAL BULL SHIT THEY WANT TO HEAR!

     TV Man 1:    YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ABANDONING EVERY HUMAN
               CODE OF BEHAVIOUR, AND THERE'S A LOT OF US
               WHO AREN'T READY FOR THAT DOCTOR FOSTER...

10      A great cry of assent goes up from the studio floor. Doctor
     Foster is flustered and frustrated. The stage hands and
     cameramen are all screaming at him, swearing and ridiculing. We
     notice Police guards, armed, at the studio doors. They control
     the traffic in and out of the big room.

11      Back at the control panel. Fran stares at the screens. Confusion
     still reigns.

     Man:      FRANNIE, GET ON THE NEW LIST OF RESCUE STATIONS.
               CHARLIE'S RECEIVING ON THE EMERGENCIES...

     Fran pulls herself away from the monitors as the argument rages
     on screen.

12      She fights through the heavy traffic and reaches Charlie, a
     harassed typist who holds the receiver of an emergency radio
     unit under his chin...

     Charlie:     (into receiver)
               SAY AGAIN...CAN'T HEAR YOU... 

     Fran:     RESCUE STATIONS?

     Fran leafs through sheets of paper on Charlie's desk. He writes
     notes as he listens on the receiver, and he speaks to the woman.

     Charlie:     HALF THOSE ARE INOPERATIVE ANY MORE.
               I'M TRYIN' TO FIND OUT AT LEAST ABOUT THE
               IMMEDIATE AREA. WE'VE HAD OLD INFORMATION
               ON THE AIR FOR THE LAST TWELVE HOURS.

     Fran:     THESE ARE RESCUE STATIONS. WE CAN'T SEND
               PEOPLE TO INOPERATIVE...

     Charlie:     (into receiver)
               SAY AGAIN, NEW HOPE...

     Charlie makes more notes and hands them to Fran. Still listening
     on the receiver, he speaks to the woman again.

     Charlie:     I'M DOIN' WHAT I CAN. THESE ARE DEFINITE
               AS OF NOW. SKIP AND DUSTY ARE ON THE RADIO,
               TOO. GOOD LUCK.

     Fran snatches up the sheets and moves across the room.

13      She stops at the consoles...

     Fran:     I'M GONNA KNOCK OFF THE OLD RESCUE STATIONS.
               I'LL HAVE THE NEW ONES READY AS SOON AS I CAN.

     Technician:  WE'RE SENDING PEOPLE TO PLACES THAT HAVE
               CLOSED DOWN. I'M GONNA KILL THE OLD LIST.

14      Fran moves toward another control room. An armed officer stops
     her. A young man rushing through with copy intercedes.

     Man:      HEY, SHE'S ALRIGHT.

     Officer:     WHERE'S YOUR BADGE?

     Fran reaches instinctively for the lapel of her blouse. Her
     badge is missing.

     Fran:     JESUS!

     Man:      SHE'S ALRIGHT.

     Fran:     I HAD IT...I WAS ASLEEP OVER THERE...

     She makes a move toward the corner where she was asleep.

     Man:      SOMEBODY STOLE IT. THERE'S A LOT OF 'EM
               MISSING.
               (to officer)
               SHE'S ALRIGHT. LET HER THROUGH.

     The officer reluctantly steps aside.

15      The young man and Fan move down a crowded hall and into a small
     camera room. The foot traffic is solid. They talk as they walk.

     Fran:     I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

     Man:      ONE OF THOSE LITTLE BADGES CAN OPEN A LOT
               OF DOORS...YOU AVOID A LOT OF HASSLES IF
               YOU GOT A BADGE...ANY KIND OF BADGE...

     Fran:     IT'S REALLY GOING CRAZY.

16      They reach a small camera installation. The camera is aimed at a
     machine which rolls out a list of rescue stations. The list is
     superimposed over the live broadcast as it goes out.

     Cameraman:   YOU GOT NEW ONES?

     Fran:     I GOTTA TYPE 'EM UP. KILL THE OLD ONES.

     Cameraman:   GIVENS WANT 'EM...

     Fran:     KILL 'EM, DICK. TELL GIVENS TO SEE ME!

     The man clicks off his camera. Fran moves toward the studio.

17      On the monitors, we see the rescue stations blink off over shots
     of the two men who still argue on the air.

     TV Man 1:    WELL I DON'T BELIEVE IN GHOSTS, DOCTOR.

     TV Man 2:    THESE ARE NOT GHOSTS. NOR ARE THESE HUMANS!
               THESE ARE DEAD CORPSES. ANY UN-BURIED HUMAN
               CORPSE WITH ITS BRAIN INTACT WILL IN FACT
               RE-ACTIVATE. AND IT'S PRECISELY BECAUSE OF
               INCITEMENT BY IRRESPONSIBLE PUBLIC FIGURES
               LIKE YOURSELF THAT THIS SITUATION IS BEING
               DEALT WITH IRRESPONSIBLY BY THE PUBLIC AT
               LARGE!

18      Another outraged cry goes up from the stagehands and observers.
     Doctor Foster tries to out-scream the cries...

     TV Man 2:    YOU HAVE NOT LISTENED...YOU HAVE NOT LISTENED...
               FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS...WHAT DOES IT TAKE...
               WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE PEOPLE SEE?

19      Fran moves into the large studio area where the broadcasters
     argue. The commotion is maddening. Fran stares for a moment.

20      TV Man 2:    (now distraught...almost pleading)
               THIS SITUATION IS CONTROLLABLE. PEOPLE
               MUST COME TO GRIPS WITH THIS CONCEPT.
               IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT...WITH FRIENDS...
               WITH FAMILY...BUT A DEAD BODY MUST BE DE-
               ACTIVATED BY EITHER DESTROYING THE BRAIN
               OR SEVERING THE BRAIN FROM THE REST OF THE
               BODY.

     Another outburst in the studio.

     TV Man 2:    THE SITUATION MUST BE CONTROLLED...BEFORE IT'S
               TOO LATE...THEY ARE MULTIPLYING TOO RAPIDLY...

21      Fran moves through the crowded room of emotional people and
     finally reaches another emergency radio installation. Skip and
     Dusty are trying to listen to their receivers. They jot notes.

     Fran:     OPERATIVE RESCUE STATIONS?

     Dusty:     THEY'RE DROPPIN' LIKE FLIES. HERE'S A FEW.
               YOU KNOW, I THINK FOSTER'S RIGHT. I THINK
               WE'RE LOSIN' THIS WAR.

     Fran:     YEAH, BUT NOT TO THE ENEMY.
               WE'RE BLOWIN' IT OURSELVES.

     She gives the rest of her coffee to the two men.

     Fran:     NOT MUCH LEFT, BUT HAVE A BALL.

     The two men each slug eagerly from the paper cup. Fran rushes
     off toward a large teleprompter typing machine.

22      The broadcasters still argue emotionally.

     TV Man 1:    PEOPLE AREN'T WILLING TO ACCEPT YOUR SOLUTIONS,
               DOCTOR, AND I, FOR ONE, DON'T BLAME THEM.

     TV Man 2:    EVERY DEAD BODY THAT IS NOT EXTERMINATED
               BECOMES ONE OF THEM! IT GETS UP AND KILLS!
               THE PEOPLE IT KILLS GET UP AND KILL!

23      Handing the list of active rescue stations to the teleprompter
     typist, Fran rushes back toward the control room.

24      Around the monitor consoles, the commotion has been made even
     more frantic by an angered Dan Givens, obviously one of the
     station managers.

     Givens:      NOBODY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT, I WANT...

     Givens spots Fran as she moves into the room.

     Givens:      GARRET, WHO TOLD YOU TO KILL THE SUPERS?

     Fran:     NOBODY. I KILLED 'EM. THEY'RE OUT OF DATE.

     Givens:      I WANT THOSE SUPERS ON THE AIR ALL THE TIME.

     Fran:     ARE YOU WILLING TO MURDER PEOPLE BY SENDING THEM
               OUT TO STATIONS THAT HAVE CLOSED DOWN?

     Givens:      WITHOUT THOSE RESCUE STATIONS ON SCREEN EVERY
               MINUTE PEOPLE WON'T WATCH US. THEY'LL TUNE OUT.

     Fran stares at the red faced man in disbelief.

     Givens:      I WANT THAT LIST UP ON THE SCREEN EVERY MINUTE THAT
               WE'RE ON THE AIR.

     Fran is about to say something in anger, but before she can, one
     of the technicians, having overheard Givens, gets up from the
     control panel and starts to walk away.

     Givens:      LUCAS...LUCAS, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING...
               GET ON THAT CONSOLE...LUCAS...WE'RE ON THE AIR!

     Lucas:     ANYBODY NEED A RIDE!

25      Two other men from various positions in the room snatch up
     personal effects and follow the technician toward the door. The
     door is guarded by a nervous Officer.

26      Givens:      OFFICER...OFFICER...YOU STOP THEM...STOP THOSE
               MEN...LUCAS...GET BACK ON THIS CONSOLE...

     A frantic hubbub begins over the lack of console control. People
     rush in and out, the floor director's voice can be heard over a
     talk back system...

     Voices:      WHAT THE HELL'S GOIN' ON IN THERE.
               SWITCH...SWITCH...THERE'S NO SWITCHER...
               WE'RE LOSING PICTURE...

     Givens:      OFFICER...STOP THOSE MEN...
      
27      The young officer faces the men as they reach his post. He takes
     a grip on his rifles, opens the door and lets the group through.
     Then he runs out himself, deserting the losing cause.

28      Givens jumps toward the console. He frantically tries to work
     the complex dials and pots...

     Givens:      GET SOMEBODY IN HERE THAT KNOWS HOW TO RUN
               THIS THING...COME ON...I'LL TRIPLE THE MONEY
               FOR THE MAN THAT CAN RUN THIS THING...TRIPLE
               THE MONEY...WE'RE STAYING ON THE AIR...

     Fran moves slowly off toward the studio.

29      In the big room, the tension is thicker than ever. A few of the
     newsmen still earnestly try to perform their various functions,
     but most of the crew are reduced to emotional polarisation over
     the broadcast which still rages.

30      TV Man 2:    THEY KILL FOR ONE REASON.
               THEY KILL FOR FOOD.
               THEY EAT THEIR VICTIMS, DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT,
               MR. BERMAN. THAT'S WHAT KEEPS THEM GOING.

31      Fran stops to listen to the argument. She falls back into the
     shadows of the studio. People rush past her, some leaving the
     studio in disgust.

32      TV Man 2:    IF WE'D LISTENED...IF WE'D DEALT WITH THE
               PHENOMENON PROPERLY...WITHOUT EMOTION...
               WITHOUT...EMOTION...
               IT WOULDN'T HAVE COME TO THIS!

     Foster wipes his sweat with a dirty hanker chief. He pulls his
     tie away from his tight collar, and pops the shirt button open.
     He is desperate now, shivering with anger and frustration.

     TV Man 2:    THERE IS A MARTIAL LAW STATE IN EFFECT IN
               PHILADELPHIA...AS IN ALL OTHER MAJOR CITIES IN
               THE COUNTRY...
               CITIZENS MUST UNDERSTAND THE...DIRE...DIRE
               CONSEQUENCES OF THIS PHENOMENON...SHOULD WE
               BE UNABLE TO CHECK THE SPREAD...
               BECAUSE OF THE EMOTIONAL ATTITUDES..OF THE
               CITIZENRY...TOWARD...THESE ISSUES OF...
               MORALITY...
               IT IS THE ORDER OF THE O.E.P. BY COMMAND OF THE
               FEDERAL GOVERNMENT...THE PRESIDENT OF THE
               UNITED STATES...
               CITIZENS MAY NO LONGER OCCUPY PRIVATE RESIDENCES,
               NO MATTER HOW SAFELY PROTECTED OR WELL STOCKED...

     A murmur in the studio begins to build to an emotional
     crescendo. Foster tries to talk over the noise...

     TV Man 2:    CITIZENS WILL BE MOVED INTO CENTRAL AREAS OF
               THE CITY...

33      Technicians abandon their posts. A few others jump in to take
     their places, but pandemonium reigns. A cameraman whips off his
     headset and breaks for the door. His camera spins on its liquid
     head, and on the monitors, we see a whirling blur as Foster
     continues to speak.

     Fran moves quickly for the spinning camera. She aims it back at
     the sweating Foster, and she stares through the viewfinder not
     believing what she is seeing.

34      TV Man 2:    THE BODIES OF THE DEAD WILL BE DELIVERED OVER
               TO SPECIALLY EQUIPPED SQUADS OF THE NATIONAL
               GUARD FOR ORGANISED DISPOSITION...

35      Suddenly a man darts out of the bustling crowd and comes up
     quickly behind Fran.

     Steve:     FRANNIE...AT NINE O'CLOCK MEET ME ON THE ROOF.
               WE'RE GETTING OUT.

     Fran:     (letting the camera slip slightly)
               STEPHEN...I DON'T BELIEVE THIS...WHAT...

     Steve:     WE'RE GETTING OUT. IN THE CHOPPER.

     Another technician steps over to take the camera from Fran.
     Stephen talks more quietly in the other man's presence.

     Steve:     NINE P.M. ALRIGHT?

     Fran:     STEVE...WE CAN'T...WE'VE GOT TO...

     Steve:     WE'VE GOT TO NOTHING, FRAN. WE'VE GOT TO
               SURVIVE. SOMEBODY'S GOT TO SURVIVE. NOW YOU
               COULD BE UP THERE AT NINE. DON'T MAKE ME COME
               LOOKIN' FOR YA.

     Stephen is gone in a flash. Fran nervously looks back at the
     cameraman. The argument still rages between Foster and Berman.
     The cameraman, without taking his eye from the viewfinder,
     speaks to Francine quietly and slowly.

     Cameraman:   GO AHEAD. WE'LL BE OFF THE AIR BY MIDNIGHT
               ANYWAY. EMERGENCY NETWORKS ARE TAKING OVER.
               OUR RESPONSIBILITY... IS FINISHED, I'M AFRAID.

36      It is dusk, and the city of Philadelphia is surprisingly quiet.
     We see several large buildings. They are part of a low-income
     housing project, and their lack of grace is evident. They stand
     like tombstones as the first stars appear in the navy blue sky.

37      Under cover of the growing darkness, activities of the S.W.A.T.
     Unit go unnoticed. Grappling hooks grab against the lip around
     the roof and silent figures climb to the top of the building.
     Men in armour vests, clutching the latest in special weapons,
     take position here and there about the development.

     Other men strategically place their cars and trucks in the court
     below.

38      On the roof, at an entrance to one of the building's fire
     stairs, Roger squats silently alongside three other team
     members. The men check their weapons. Roger looks at his watch.
     The sweep hand reaches the 12...

     Roger:     (to himself) LIGHTS.

39      In an instant, large searchlights bathe the side of the
     building. The troop commander, shielded with other Officers
     behind a large truck, shouts through an electric bullhorn.

     Commander:   MARTINEZ...YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING...YOU KNOW WE
               HAVE THE BUILDING SURROUNDED...

     The electronically amplified voice echoes through the concrete
     caverns between the buildings of the project. There are only a
     few windows which glow with lights from inside. At the sound of
     the bullhorn, the lights all blink out one at a time.

     Commander:   (not over the bullhorn)
               LITTLE BASTARD'S GOT 'EM ALL MOVED INTO ONE
               BUILDING...DUMB LITTLE BASTARD!

     Sergeant:    LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE GONNA TRY TO FIGHT US.

     Commander:   (on the bullhorn again)
               MARTINEZ...THE PEOPLE IN THIS PROJECT ARE YOUR
               RESPONSIBILITY...WE DON'T WANT ANY OF THEM HURT
               AND NEITHER DO YOU!

42      There is no sign of life in the building. The great concrete
     slab is silhouetted silently against the darkening sky.

43      Roger, and his team mates, crouch in readiness. The sound of the
     bullhorn rises to them easily and clearly.

     Roger:     I'M GIVIN' YOU THREE MINUTES, MARTINEZ...

     Commander:   (Bullhorn)
               I'M GIVIN' YOU THREE MINUTES, MARTINEZ...
               TURN OVER YOUR WEAPONS AND SURRENDER...

     Roger:     THERE ARE NO CHARGES AGAINST YOU...

     Commander:   THERE ARE NO CHARGES AGAINST YOU OR ANY OF YOUR
               PEOPLE...

     Roger:     YET.

     Commander:   THREE MINUTES, MARTINEZ.

     Roger:     AND COUNTING.
               (he looks at his watch)

     There is a long silence.

     Roger:     COME ON, MARTINEZ!

     One of the other S.W.A.T. team members is a big man, with a
     rough and vicious looking face. He is WOOLEY, a hardened
     veteran, and a red neck of the first order.

     Wooley:      YEAH, COME ON, MARTINEZ...SHOW YOUR GREASY
               LITTLE PUERTO RICAN ASS...SO I CAN BLOW IT OFF...

     Roger looks over at the big man. He is distressed at the pent up
     violence in Wooley.

     Wooley:      I'LL BLOW ALL THEIR ASSES OFF...LOW LIFE BASTARDS..
               BLOW ALL THEIR LITTLE LOW LIFE PUERTO RICAN AND
               NIGGER ASSES RIGHT OFF...

     Roger is greatly concerned. He looks at one of the other men, a
     young, smoothed faced rookie. The boy doesn't know now to react.
     He is obviously nervous.

     Roger:     KEEP COOL. JUST DON'T POP OFF IN THERE WHEN WE
               GO IN.

     The boy nods, grateful for a more human contact.

     Wooley:      HOW THE HELL COME WE STICK THESE LOW LIFES
               IN THESE BIG ASS FANCY HOTELS ANYWAY? SHIT
               MAN. THIS' BETTER THAN I GOT. YOU AIN'T
               GONNA TALK 'EM OUTA HERE. YOU GOTTA BLOW
               'EM OUT. BLOW THEIR ASSES!

     Roger:     (to the boy)
               YOU GONNA BE ALRIGHT?

     The boy nods in the affirmative.

     Wooley:      LET'S GET ON WITH IT. THIS IS A WASTE OF
               MY TIME!

44      CRASH! Without warning, the metal door to the fire stair bursts
     open and several figures rush out of the darkness. Shots are
     fired from hand guns. A bullet smashes through the skull of the
     young boy next to Roger. He falls against Roger with a pleading
     expression on his face.

     Figures charge this way and that. More gunfire. The other
     S.W.A.T. men dodge and dive for cover. Wooley opens fire with
     his automatic weapon.

45      On the street, the Commander, hearing the gunfire, barks into
     the bullhorn:

     Commander:   MOVE IN...MOVE IN...
               GODDAMMIT!

     Sergeant:    (into walkie talkie)
               ALL UNITS... FULL OPERATION!

46      On the roof, Roger struggles under the dead weight of the young
     man. He tries to free himself and his weapons. Shots ring out.

     A handful of Black and Puerto Rican youngsters charge about the
     rooftop. Another S.W.A.T. patrol appears from behind a large
     elevator housing. The young civilians retreat. Several are mowed
     down.

     Another bullet smashes against the dead S.W.A.T. man's back.
     Just as Roger frees himself, a bullet catches him squarely in
     the chest, but his armour takes the impact. He is thrown back
     off balance, and he struggles to catch his wind as he scrambles
     over to recover his weapon which skitters away across the roof
     top.

     Before he reaches the gun, he is cut off by the looming figure
     of one of the Black youths, pistol in hand. Roger freezes. The
     young man aims his hand gun, but hesitates. A sudden barrage of
     bullets rips through the young Black and he falls in a pool of
     blood. It was Wooley's gun that killed him.

     Wooley:      COME ON YOU DUMB BASTARDS...
               COME AND GET 'EM...

     He fires again and again, even though the skirmish is winding
     down.

     Roger charges for his weapon, snatches it up, and runs for the
     cover of an incinerator housing. He startles a young civilian
     who was hiding there, trying to load his gun. The boy makes a
     break...

     Roger:     HOLD IT...

     The boy freezes for a moment, then, thinking, breaks into a run
     across the roof.

     Roger:     HOLD IT, KID...DON'T RUN OUT THERE!

     The boy is mowed down in a crossfire.

47      Inside the building, other S.W.A.T. teams along with units of
     the National Guard are crashing through hallways and breaking
     into apartment units. People are herded into the halls where
     they are held at gun point.

     Some men, although armed, surrender willingly. Others retaliate
     against the invading force, and little skirmishes develop on
     every floor of the complex structure.

48      On the ground, the Commander barks into the bullhorn:

     Commander:   MASKS...

     Sergeant:    (into walkie talkie)
               MASKS FOR GAS...MASKS FOR GAS.

49      Tear gas canisters crash through windows and the halls are
     filled with clouds of gas. Civilians trying to escape, are
     choked as they attempt to shoot their way out.

50      The teams on the roof charge down the fire stairs into the
     building.

     S.W.A.T. 1:  WORK YOUR WAY DOWN. A FLOOR AT A TIME.
               HOLD 'EM IN THE HALLS 'TIL WE CAN WORK 'EM
               DOWN THE STAIRS.

     Roger and Wooley and the men in their unit, snap on their
     bizarre looking gas masks.

51      The troopers break into an apartment on the floor. An old couple
     kneels in prayer at a small alter, while their children and
     their children's children huddle in a corner. The young husband
     surrenders his gun to a trooper, and Roger watches as the group
     is led into the hallway.

     Suddenly, a young Black man charges out of one of the
     apartments. A woman appears at the door, screaming for him to
     stop. He breaks through a cloud of gas and Wooley fires his
     automatic. The black man crashes to the floor. Wooley is crazed.
     He kicks in the door of another apartment and fires randomly
     into the room.

     The flurry of action causes panic among the civilians in the
     hall. The younger ones try to escape while the older people
     kneel or fall against the walls praying.

     S.W.A.T. 2:  WOOLEY'S GONE APE SHIT, MAN...

     Roger:     WOOLEY! (shouting)

     Wooley kicks in the door of another apartment. Roger charges at
     him and grabs him around the shoulders. The big man resists. His
     gun fires and bullets fly wildly. He struggles against Roger,
     but Roger manages to hold on.

     Roger:     GIMME A HAND...SOMEBODY...

     Another S.W.A.T. Trooper steps up out of the cloud of gas. He is
     very tall and he looks mysterious in the fog as he speaks in a
     deep voice.

     Trooper:     STEP AWAY FROM HIM.

     Roger:     GIMME A HAND.

     Wooley throws his body around and slams Roger against the wall,
     but Roger grabs him again just as the crazed man is levelling
     off his gun at the open apartment door.

     Roger:     GODDAMMIT...HELP ME...HE'S CRAZY!

     Trooper:     STEP AWAY FROM HIM!

     Just then, Wooley wrenches free and pushes Roger across the
     hallway. The Trooper carefully aims his weapon and fires one
     shot through Wooley's head. The big man falls back violently.

     The mysterious Trooper turns and hurries away down the hall.
     Other S.W.A.T. Officers face him threateningly. He stares at
     them through his mask. They let him pass. He disappears through
     the smoke as other officers begin to restore order among the
     civilians.

     Women scream and cry over their dead-loved ones. Roger is helped
     to his feet by another Officer. Roger's eyes are wide and
     staring through the insect-like lenses of his mask. They are
     locked on the sight he sees through the door of the apartment
     which Wooley kicked open. The other Trooper looks and his eyes
     widen as well.

53      In the apartment, lying in a pool of blood, are the partial
     remains of what was a human body. It has been ripped to shreds.

     Roger staggers against the door frame. The other trooper moves
     inside. Another corpse, also mutilated, one leg missing, one arm
     badly mangled. It is trying to move. To reach the Troopers.

54      A sudden loud scream. Roger startles and spins around. A woman
     in the hall has seen the grisly sight, and she runs screaming
     down the corridor. More confusion, as civilians push through the
     Troopers who try to hold them back.

55      The Trooper in the apartment is revulsed...

     Trooper:     JESUS...HOLY JESUS...

     A third officer enters the apartment. He speaks to the Trooper
     which is closest to the writhing corpse on the floor.

     Trooper 2:   SHOOT IT...SHOOT IT THROUGH THE HEAD.

     The young officer is too dumb struck to respond so the third
     Officer pulls out his pistol. Then suddenly, from out of the
     shadows, a spectre-like figure lunges at the third Officer,
     flailing and biting at his arms. It is a wild-haired woman.
     There are several bleeding wounds over her body. She is one of
     the walking dead.

     The Trooper struggles to free himself, and Roger darts into the
     room. Although the Zombie is weak, she manages to hold on to the
     Trooper.

     Another creature suddenly appears in the bedroom doorway. A
     male, it staggers out into the room. The young Trooper struggles
     with his holster trying to free his hand gun. Suddenly, he feels
     something on his leg. The dismembered corpse is clutching his
     ankle, pulling itself closer, it's mouth open. The boy tries to
     pull away, but falls onto the floor, crashing over a table and
     lamp. He tries to crawl away, but the frail corpse keeps its
     hold and drags along behind the young Trooper, who still cannot
     free his pistol.

     Roger and the third Officer fling all their weight against the
     woman Zombie. She flies against a wall, but bounces back
     immediately, and attacks again. The third Trooper's rifle fires.
     A slug tears through the woman's chest but it doesn't stop her
     onslaught. Another shot rips through her neck. Still she comes.

     The boy on the floor manages to level off his pistol. He fires
     at the ghoulish head which draws closer to his leg. The thing's
     skull blows open and its grasp relaxes. The boy is shaking
     violently. His arm and gun stay in the air, still poised. He
     fires again...and again...and again.

56      In the hall, the male Zombie appears, and the crowd panics. The
     Troopers try to keep things calm.

     S.W.A.T. 3:  IT'S ONE OF THEM...MY GOD...IT'S ONE OF THEM.

     S.W.A.T. 4:  SHOOT FOR THE HEAD.

     Woman:     NO! NO! MIGUEL...DIOS MIO...MIGUELITO...

     The woman pushes through the crowd. The Zombies advances. Before
     the Trooper can stop her, the woman throws her arms around the
     creature.

     Woman:     MIGUEL...MI VIDA...MIGUELITO...

     S.W.A.T. 3:  GRAB HER...GET HER OUT OF THERE...
               (his gun is levelled off, but he can't get a shot)

     The Zombie clutches at the woman. It bites at her neck...her
     arm. She screams with terror. She tries to pull away, but the
     creature holds her. It bites again. A Trooper comes up from
     behind and tries to wrestle the creature away. Another Trooper
     grabs the woman and tries to free her. She is screaming
     insanely. The Zombie pulls another piece of flesh off her arm.

     S.W.A.T. 3:  STAND CLEAR...FOR CHRISSAKE...STAND CLEAR!

57      In the apartment, the female Zombie lunges at the third Trooper
     and the two tumble to the floor. Roger wrestles her free and,
     with all his might, throws her against the wall. She advances
     again. Roger raises his gun, She is just about to reach him. He
     fires. The bullet drops her.

58      In the hall, a Trooper brings his gun butt slamming against the
     male ghoul's head. The creature loses his grip on the screaming
     woman. The Trooper who is holding her, pulls her free across the
     floor. S.W.A.T. 3 fires. The bullet tears through the Zombie's
     shoulder...another shot...through his neck...another...through
     the skull. It falls.

59      There is finally a calm. A few of the citizens murmur prayers.
     Troopers and befuddled old people seem to drift through the
     clouds of gas in a totally dazed state.

60      Roger and the third Trooper from the apartment drift to the
     hallway. The third Trooper moves into the crowd, but Roger
     stands against the open door jamb for a moment.

     A sudden, loud gunshot makes Roger duck and spin around. He
     looks into the apartment. The young Trooper has shot himself
     through the head.

61      In the dark firestair, it is very quiet. Roger bursts through a
     metal door from one of the halls and falls against the stair
     railing. He is retching. He breathes heavily to contain himself.
     He removes his mask and coughs slightly from the gas mist which
     still clings in the air.

     Voice:     YOU'RE NOT ALONE BROTHER.

     Roger tightens, grabbing for his gun. The voice is present; very
     nearby. Roger looks up. Sitting on the stairs above is the
     Trooper who shot Wooley. His rifle is aimed at Roger.

     Voice:     YOU WAS IN WOOLEY'S UNIT.

     Roger:     I DIDN'T SEE NOTHIN.
               I DIDN'T SEE HOW HE DIED.

     Roger slings his rifle, so the Trooper relaxes and lowers his
     gun. He removes his gas mask. He is Black.

     Roger:     YOU RUNNIN?

     The Black man shrugs. He hasn't decided.

     Roger:     I DON'T JUST MEAN 'CAUSE OF WOOLEY.
               I JUST MEAN 'CAUSE OF...

     Voice:     YEAH. I KNOW.

     Roger:     THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE RUNNIN'.
               I COULD RUN.

     Roger stares up at the grim faced Black.

     Roger:     I COULD RUN RIGHT TONIGHT.

     The black man just stares levelly into Roger's eyes.

     Roger:     FRIEND OF MINE GOT A HELICOPTER. HE DOES
               TRAFFIC FOR J.A.S. GOT A HELICOPTER AND HE'S
               RUNNIN' OUT WITH IT. AS'T ME T'COME.

     The Black man smiles.

     Roger:     YOU THINK IT'S RIGHT TO RUN?

     The Black man shrugs again, then he stands and walks down the
     stairs. HE turns past Roger on the landing and continues down
     into the lingering gas mist. Roger follows.

62      A few landings down...a noise. The two Troopers freeze. The
     stairwell is dark. The noise grows louder. The Troopers ready
     their weapons.

     The sounds are little scraping thumps, like the weary foot falls
     of someone...something...trying to negotiate the stairs...There
     is the low, wheezing sound of laboured breath.

     The men stare at the landing below. The Black man steps forward
     slightly, trying not to make a sound.

     Suddenly, a figure pops out of the darkness. It falls against
     the wall below. Both Troopers raise their guns. The figure pulls
     away from the wall. In the mist, it's shape is ghostly...
     robed...in black...is sees the Troopers...

     Figure:      SENORES...
               PLEASE TO LET ME PASS...

     The voice weakens into a low wheezing cough. The figure slumps
     and sits on the steps, clinging to the railing. It is an old
     Priest, obviously from a local Puerto Rican Parish.

     Roger stoops next to the old man, who is struggling to keep his
     breath. He is weary. He seems to be near death. He clutches at
     his chest.

     Roger tries to support him.

     Roger:     LET'S GET HIM TO THE MEDICS...

     Priest:      NO...NO...NO...PLEASE. JUST...LET
               ME PASS...MY SISTER...I GO UP TO SEVEN
               FLOOR...TO FIND MY SISTER...

     Roger:     THEY'RE TAKIN' EVERYONE DOWN...THEY PROBABLY
               BROUGHT HER DOWN...COME ONE...

     Priest:      MY SISTER...SHE IS DEAD...THEY TELL ME...
               THE DEAD THEY DO NOT BRING DOWN.

     Roger and the Black Trooper shoot glances at one another.

     Priest:      JUST LET ME PASS. MARTINEZ IS DEAD.
               THE PEOPLE OF 107 WILL DO WHAT YOU
               WISH NOW. THESE SIMPLE PEOPLE...
               BUT STRONG...THEY HAVE LITTLE...BUT THEY
               DO NOT GIVE IT UP EASILY. AND THEY GIVE
               UP THEIR DEAD...TO NO ONE!

     The Priest goes into a coughing fit. The Troopers look on. Roger
     wants to help in some way.

     Priest:      MANY HAVE DIED ON THESE STREETS IN THE LAST
               WEEKS...IN THE BASEMENT OF THIS BUILDING
               YOU FIND THEM...

     The Troopers are shocked. The Priest struggles to his feet.

     Priest:      I HAVE GIVEN THEM THE LAST RITES.
               NOW...YOU DO WHAT YOU WILL...

     The old man starts up the stairs. Roger moves to help him, but
     the big Black man stops him. The Priest weaves up through the
     gas mist, coughing.

     Priest:      YOU ARE STRONGER THAN US...BUT SOON, I
               THINK...THEY BE STRONGER THAN YOU...

     The old man's voice trails off up the stairwell as he disappears
     in the cloud...

     Priest:      WHEN THE DEAD WALK, SENORES...WE MUST
               STOP THE KILLING...OR WE LOSE THE WAR...

63      In the basement of the large building, S.W.A.T. troopers pry at
     the boards which are nailed over the entrance to the storage
     area.

     The rest of the riot troops stand at the ready, weapons
     raised...high powered rifles...flame throwers...

     The nails creak loudly as they are pulled free. The men are
     silent, not knowing what to expect.

     There are three boards left...then two...

     With a great, tearing sound, the door flies open before the men
     remove the last boards. The boards fly and the door almost rips
     off its hinges. Like flood waters, a small army of Zombies
     pushes into the hall.

     They are wide eyed and terrifying. In life, they were mostly
     Blacks and Puerto Ricans from the neighbouring buildings. They
     are all ages, from the very old to the very young.

     The riot troops are stunned. They cannot react quickly enough,
     and the squeeze is so tight in the little hall that it is
     impossible to shoot accurately, or without the bullets injuring
     other troopers.

     The men fight back, wrestling and trying to back away. In the
     front line, Zombies bite at the flesh of the humans. Teeth tear
     into arms and hands. Some men are trampled in the crush.

     Commander:   BACK OFF...BACK OFF...SPREAD OUT...

     The rear lines retreat into the wider vestibule, and as the mass
     of struggling bodies spreads out, shots begin to fire. Some
     Troopers, at close quarters, are able to fire off accurate
     rounds with their hand guns. Others fall and are lunged at by
     clutching ghouls.

     Roger and the Black Trooper are in the middle of the battle.
     They fight off several of the creatures. The battle spreads into
     little skirmishes through the dark hallways. The highly
     organised Troopers are scattered and confused by the mindless
     onslaught.

64      As the main action moves away from the entrance to the storage
     area, several Troopers move into the room.

     The walls are dank and grey. There is a dripping sound. All
     around lie remnants of human civilisation. Baby buggies and
     bicycles chained to pipes which ring the area. Large trunks and
     cartons of every size and shape; old beds and other furniture.

     And here and there throughout the large area lie the remains of
     corpses. They have been eaten away. Most of them are still
     moving, their heads uninjured.

     Two of the Troopers retreat, revulsed. The sound of the gunfire
     and screaming can be heard from the hall.

     The big Black man walks calmly into the room. Roger watches him.
     He walks up to the writhing creatures one at a time, and fires
     carefully aimed shots into their heads with his hand gun. Tears
     roll down his cheeks.

     Some of the creatures are without arms and legs. Some have been
     eaten away about the neck and shoulder. They moan with a
     gurgling, gutteral sound as they try to move.

     A young Black Zombie, pulling itself along the floor with one
     arm, draws close to the Black Trooper. The big man aims his
     pistol. It clicks...empty. He quickly and efficiently reaches
     for more ammunition and begins to reload. The Zombie pulls
     closer, its mouth wide.

     Roger steps up behind the other Trooper and fires into the
     creatures head with his automatic rifle.

     The Black man brushes tears from his eyes and continues to load
     the pistol.

     Roger disposes of several other creatures. he comes to a place
     where several are piled together. Some lie still, others writhe
     about. Two on the heap, although they cannot move about, are
     eating at parts of other bodies. Roger shoots them. They never
     look up. They don't seem to notice him at all.

     A loud creaking sound breaks the mood suddenly. Roger looks up.

65      In the ceiling, a double set of loading doors has been opened.
     Several other Troopers look down into the storage area.

     Trooper:     JESUS CHRIST.

     He shines a light beam down towards Roger.

     Trooper:     YOU OK DOWN THERE?

64      Roger nods.

65      Trooper:     THIS MUST BE WHERE THEY DUMPED 'EM IN.

64      Roger looks down at the pile of corpses beneath the opening.

65      Trooper:     YOU NEED MORE MEN?

64      Roger shakes his head "no".

65      Trooper:     JESUS CHRIST.

     The trooper leaves the opening. He is replaced by two others who
     just stare down into the storage room through the weird, round
     lenses of their masks.

66      The distant sounds of the battle in the hall flare up again. The
     big Black man snaps his loaded clip into his pistol and takes a
     few steps forwards. He sees a corpse wrapped in a bed sheet and
     tied securely with clothes line. It looks like a mummy. It is
     writhing, trying to free itself. he shoots it through the head.

     Nearby, a small corpse, that of a very young child, is also
     writhing, but the end of the shroud, where the child's feet
     should be, has been torn open and is bloody. A stump kicks
     around the blood where a foot has been eaten off. The Black man
     fires into the thing's head.

     Roger:     THEY...ATTACK...EACH OTHER...

     Black:     JUST THE FRESH CORPSES...BEFORE THEY REVIVE...

     Roger:     WHY DID THESE PEOPLE KEEP THEM HERE? WHY
               DON'T THEY TURN THEM OVER...OR...OR DESTROY
               THEM THEMSELVES...IT'S INSANE...WHY DO THEY
               DO IT?

     Black:     'CAUSE THEY STILL BELIEVE THERE'S
               RESPECT IN DYING.

     The big man fires into the head of another squirming Zombie.

67      In the halls of the building, Troopers fall and are pounced on
     by ghouls. Other Troopers fire their automatics through the
     heads of attacking Zombies. The riot troops try to stay
     organised, but the onslaught is so mindless and random that it
     is turning into a riot.

68A     The buildings of Philadelphia loom in the moonlight. What few
     lights remain lit reflect in the waters of the Delaware.

68B     It is quiet except for the slight sounds of lapping water and an
     occasional wooden creak as the floating docks strain against one
     another.

     There are a few big Police launches still docked in the marina.
     They bob about silently. The chain, which normally restricted
     the area, is broken and dangling. The sign, which reads: CITY OF
     PHILADELPHIA - POLICE - NO ADMITTANCE clangs against the broken
     chain in the wind.

     Halfway down the long dock is a little guard house. Inside,
     sitting at a radio transmitter, is the corpse of a uniformed
     guard.

     Nearby is a separate floating dock on which is painted a large
     square pattern. It is a landing bay for Police helicopters.
     Alongside, afloat separately but securely chained fast, is a
     small fuel barge, with pumps and hoses for refueling the chopper
     and launches.

     The other bodies lie bleeding on the bobbing docks, another
     officer and a civilian. A bell buoy rings in the distance and we
     begin to hear the sound of an approaching helicopter.

     The blades of the J.A.S. Traffic Copter whine as they gear down
     for a landing. The whirlybird settles like a hummingbird on the
     gently bobbing heliport.

69      With the blades still spinning loudly, Stephen hops out of the
     cockpit.

     Steve:     COME ON...I NEED YOU.

     Francine unbuckles her safety belt and jumps out of her side of
     the machine. Steve runs, ducking under the blades, around to the
     woman's side of the cockpit, grabs her hand, and they make for
     the fuel pumps.

     Steve:     I DON'T SEE ROGER. WE'LL GIVE HIM TEN MINUTES.

     Fran:     OH MY GOD!

70      The woman freezes in mid stride, and her action brings Stephen's
     eyes around to see what she is staring at. The two bodies which
     lie near the fuel pumps.

     Steve:     YOU HAVEN'T BEEN OUT IN IT AT ALL.
               IT'S TOUGH TO GET USED TO IT.

     He pulls her quickly along. They have to actually step over the
     civilian corpse. Fran freezes again. She can't bring herself to
     walk over the body. Steve lets go of her hand and checking the
     tank gauge, he pulls the hose with him as he moves quickly back
     to Fran. The long hose is heavy, and it bobbles the civilian
     corpse, almost rolling it over. The back of the bodies head has
     been blown out by the exit wound of a powerful bullet. Blood
     still runs. The wound is fresh. Steve does not see this as he
     tugs the hose over the corpse and moves to the helicopter with
     Fran following.

71      At the side of the machine, the blades still spinning overhead,
     Steve jams the hose nozzle into the fuel tank receptacle. He
     pulls one of Fran's hands into the nozzle mechanism.

     Steve:     JUST LIKE THIS...LIKE A CAR...

     Fran responds, getting the feel of the nozzle trigger.

     Steve:     THAT'S IT...JUST HOLD HER THERE 'TIL SHE
               SPITS OUT AT YA.

     The woman takes over and Stephen trots away toward the guard
     shed. The propeller blades still spin. They make an eerie,
     whispering sound as they pass over Fran's head. She can hear the
     lapping water now, and the creaking moans of the shifting docks.
     She looks this way and that, fear in her eyes.

72      At the guard house, Stephen rushes in to find the dead radio
     operator. A signal is coming over the receiver in Morse Code.
     The corpse is slumped over the desk and it is covering the send
     key. A small entry wound is barely visible in the back of the
     dead man's head. As Stephen pulls the body up to an erect
     posture in its chair, he sees that the exit of the bullet all
     but obliterated the corpse's face. Again the wound is still
     running and bits of flesh and blood are splattered about the
     desk and the radio unit.

     Stephen clicks on the send switch and he quickly begins to send
     a message in Morse:

               OPERATOR DEAD...POST ABANDONED...

73      Back on the fuel dock, the long hose brushes over the civilian
     corpse. A shadow moves nearby, making is aware of a presence
     other than Fran's.

74      The woman switches hands on the pump nozzle. The blades still
     whoosh overhead. Then she hears the sound of another engine. She
     looks towards the mainland. The headlights of an approaching
     vehicle can be seen.

75      At the guard house, Stephen, hearing the approaching engine,
     steps into the doorway and looks up the dock. He calls to Fran.

     Steve:     I HOPE IT'S ROGER.

76      Fran:     WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

     Steve:     I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

77      He ducks back into the shed. He snatches up a First Aid Kit and
     throws it into a khaki knapsack. He rummages in the darkness. He
     finds a toolbox.

     As he stands up, he backs into a tall figure which stands in the
     shadows. Feeling something sharp and hard against his back.
     Steve recoils and spins to face the figure. It is a uniformed
     officer. His rifle is levelled off at Steve's chest. From out of
     the shadows, a second Policeman appears with a hand gun cocked
     and aimed.

78      Fran's eyes strain to discern the approaching vehicle, but
     suddenly she catches a movement in the corner of her vision.
     Through the open sides of the helicopter bubble, she notices a
     Police van. It has been there all along, it's doors flung wide
     open, as though abandoned hurriedly. Now one of the rear doors
     move. A figure appears carrying a large packing carton. The
     figure is uniformed, with two rifles strapped to its back. It
     rushes toward the launch docks.

     Voice:     JUST STAY COOL.

     Fran, already startled by the running figure, is now doubly
     shocked by the calm voice behind her. She spins and the fuel
     nozzle clatters out of it's receptacle to the wooden dock
     boards. She is facing another "Policeman", to aims a rifle
     directly at her head.

     Officer 1:   IF YOU DIE...IT'LL BE YOUR OWN FAULT.

     The Officer who is running with the carton shouts toward the
     Guard House.

     Officer 2:   COME ON SKIPPER...THEY GOT FRIENDS COMIN'.

79      In the Guard House, Steve is held at bay by one of the Officers
     while the other uniformed man moves to the door to check the
     progress of the approaching vehicles.

     Officer 3:   WHO ARE YOU?

     Steve:     WE'RE WITH J.A.S...WE...

     Officer 4:   (at the door)
               ABOUT A MINUTE AND A HALF.
               (referring to the arrival time of the vehicle)

     Officer 3, the Skipper, pushes Steve with his gun barrel. Steve
     spins out through the open doorway. He looks up the dock and
     sees the vehicle which is just turning onto the pier which is
     almost a mile long.

80      Officer 1 has moved around Fran and he reaches into the
     helicopter bubble pulling out Steve's rifle.

81      Steve:     NOW WAIT A MINUTE...WE'RE JUST HERE TO REFUEL...
               THESE MEN WERE ALREADY DEAD...YOU WERE HERE...
               YOU KNOW THAT...IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY WAS
               AFTER THE LAUNCHES...WE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH...

     Officer 3:   (looking at the insignia on the helicopter)
               HEY...J.A.S. TRAFFIC WATCH...
               STEVE ANDREWS.

     Steve:     (trying to capitalise on his minor celebrity power)
               RIGHT...THAT'S ME...I'M STEVE ANDREW...

     Officer 3:   NO SHIT.

82      Officer 1:   (shouting from the helicopter)
               WE'D GET A LOT FURTHER IN THIS BIRD, SKIPPER.

83      Steve freezes again, sensing that these are not law enforcers.

84      The man who was carrying the carton is now rushing back up the
     dock having deposited his load in one of the motor launches.

     Officer 2:   CAN'T ALL FIT.

85      Officer 3:   (directly to Stephen)
               HOW MANY WILL THAT THING HOLD?

     Officer 4:   HEY, MAN, I AIN'T GOIN' NOWHERE IN NOTHIN' I
               CAN'T DRIVER MYSELF!

86      Officer 2 has returned to the van and is carrying out another
     carton rushing back to the launch.

     Officer 2:   THAT'S TRUE...SOMETHIN' HAPPENS TO HIM AND
               WE'RE STUCK. STAY WITH THE LAUNCH!

     Officer 1:   GET A LOT FURTHER IN THIS BIRD!

87      Suddenly, above the two white headlights of the approaching
     vehicle, we see a third light in red. It is the spinning
     "bubble-gum-machine" of a Squad Car. It is heralded by one
     blast of the car's siren.

88      Officer 4:   HEY, THAT'S A BLACK AND WHITE!

89      Officer 1 still holds his rifle aimed at Fran.

     Officer 1:   THEY SEEN US!

90      Officer 3:   IT'S ALRIGHT...WE'RE POLICE...

91      Officer 2 dumps his carton at the edge of the dock and pulls one
     rifle from his back.

     Officer 2:   BULL SHIT...LET'S GET TO THE BOAT!

92      Officer 3 stares hard at Stephen. Then at the Squad Car. Then
     back at the nervous young pilot.

     Officer 3:   YOU'RE RUNNIN', AIN'T YOU, FLY BOY?

     Steve does not respond. He is terrified, not knowing what answer
     to be the safest.

     Officer 3:   YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS IS RUNNIN' OFF IN THE
               J.A.S. TRAFFIC BIRD...

     The man starts to grin with knowing. He suddenly feels in more
     control.

     Officer 3: SIT TIGHT, BOYS...THEY'RE RUNIN', TOO.

93      It seems to take forever for the Police Car to pull down the
     dock. Stephen takes a few steps forward, squinting to see, but
     he is threatened by the "Policeman's" gun barrels.

94      The car screeches to a stop and two armed S.W.A.T. Troopers
     immediately pop out of the front seat on either side. They are
     Roger and the Black Trooper.

     Roger:     WHAT'S THE PROBLEM, OFFICER?

95      Officer 3:   CAUGHT YOUR FRIENDS HERE STEALIN' COMPANY
               GASOLINE.

96      Roger:     WHAT DO YOU MEAN FRIENDS?

     Roger is trying to play dumb, assuming that the other Policemen
     are on official business...

97      Steve:     THEY KNOW, ROG...
               THEY'RE TRYIN' TO GET OUT, TOO.

     Officer 3:   IT'D BE CRAZY TO START SHOOTIN' AT ONE
               ANOTHER, NOW WOULDN'T IT?

98      Roger:     SURE WOULD.

99      Officer 1:   ALRIGHT, LET'S LOAD UP...

     He slings his rifle and tosses the other gun back to Fran. She
     bobbles it and it falls, skittering across the dock.

     Officer 1:   YOU BETTER LEARN HOW TO USE THAT THING, WOMAN.
               TIMES IS TENSE.

100     The policemen start to unload crates and cartons from their Van.
     The big Black Trooper pulls a few supplies from out of the squad
     car and carries them toward the helicopter.

101     Fran trots over toward Stephen. He is just coming back out of
     the guardhouse where he picked up the toolbox and the knapsack
     full of supplies. The woman falls into his arms. Roger trots up.

     Roger:     YOU OK?

     Stephen:     (nods)
               WHO'S HE?
               (referring to the big Black)

     Roger:     HIS NAME'S PETER. HE'S ALRIGHT.

     The three are already moving toward the helicopter.

     Roger:     LET'S HUSTLE.

102     Peter has stowed the supplies in the rear of the cockpit, and he
     has noticed the fuel hose lying on the dock. He tries the nozzle
     in the receptacle on the chopper and holds it in until the tank
     fills.

103     The other "Policemen" are still moving cartons of supplies from
     their van down the dock.

     Roger:     (to the other Policemen)
               YOU GUYS BETTER MOVE IT. THERE'S A RADIO
               REPORT ABOUT THE DOCK BEIN' KNOCKED OUT.

104     They reach the cockpit. Fran climbs in and crouches on the floor
     in the rear of the bubble.

     Fran:     YOU SURE THIS'LL CARRY US ALL.

     Steve:     LITTLE HARDER ON THE FUEL, BUT WE'LL BE OK.

105     As Peter climbs aboard, one of the other policemen, carrying a
     final carton, speaks to Roger.

     Officer 2:   HEY...YOU GOT ANY CIGARETTES.

     Roger looks at the others one at a time. Fran shakes her head
     "no".

     Roger:     SORRY. (he trots around to the passenger seat)

     Steve:     WHERE YA HEADED?

     Officer 2:   DOWN RIVER...GOT AN IDEA MAYBE WE CAN MAKE IT TO
               THE ISLANDS.

     Steve:     WHAT ISLANDS? (he starts the engine)

     Officer 2:   ANY ISLANDS...WHAT ABOUT YOU? WHERE YOU HEADED?

     Steve:     STRAIGHT UP.

106     The Policeman rushes off with his two cohorts. As they untie one
     of the launches from the dock, the J.A.S. helicopter whines
     loudly. Then it lifts off the dock with a smooth motion.

     The Police launch starts without a problem, and it pulls out
     onto the dark river.

107     The lights on the helicopter blink as the metal bird swoops low
     over the Philadelphia skyline. We see an empty city.
     Independence Hall...Betsy Ross' House, which flies the original
     American flag...the oldest American heritages stand coldly in
     the night. The whirring engine fades overhead.

108     In the cockpit, Fran lights a cigarette. So does Roger. No one
     comments, but Peter smiles slightly.

     The big Black looks down at the city.

     Peter:     ANY OF YOU LEAVIN' PEOPLE BEHIND?

     Fran:     AN EX-HUSBAND.

     Roger:     AN EX-WIFE.

     Steve:     YOU PETER?

     Peter:     (still looking down)
               SOME BROTHERS.

109     The whirlybird cuts through the dark night sky. It flies over
     open country now, moving West. Some time has passed.

110     Roger is asleep in the passenger seat. Twisted in the cramped
     rear of the cockpit, Fran and Peter sit very close to each
     other. Peter still stares off into the night.

     Fran:     REAL BROTHERS?

     Peter looks at her. He has a strong face.

     Fran:     REAL BROTHERS OR...STREET BROTHERS?

     Peter:     BOTH.

     Fran:     HOW MANY REAL ONES?

     Peter:     TWO.

     Fran:     TWO.

     Peter:     ONE'S IN JAIL. THE OTHER'S A PRO BALL PLAYER.
               BUT WE CATCH UP TO EACH OTHER ONCE IN A WHILE.

     Fran doesn't quite know how to respond.

     Peter:     (nodding at Steve...the engine roars too loudly
               for the pilot to hear the conversation)
               HE YOUR MAN NOW?

     Fran is taken off guard. She smiles slightly.

     Fran:     MOST OF THE TIME, YEAH.

     Peter:     JUST LIKE TO KNOW WHO EVERYONE IS.

     Fran:     YEAH. ME TOO.

111     Light downs on the horizon. The little helicopter chugs through
     the shades of blue.

112     Now Fran is asleep and Roger still snores. Peter stares at the
     back of the pilot's head. Steve nods slightly, then shakes
     himself. Soon, he nods again...falling asleep. Peter kicks him
     in the shoulder.

     Steve looks back, surprised that the big man is awake. Peter
     just stares at him.

     Steve rubs his face violently with his free hand. He pulls at
     his lower eyelids.

     Steve:     ANY MORE WATER?

     Peter reaches into the supplies and produces a plastic container
     with water. Steve slugs some of it and pours a little onto his
     face. Then he passes it back to Peter, who also drinks.

     Suddenly, Fran stiffens and wakes up with a start. Peter looks
     over at her with a gentle expression. She takes a moment to
     orient herself.

     Peter:     (to Stephen)
               YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE?

     Steve:     I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE.

     Peter:     HARRISBURG?

     Steve:     PASSED IT ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

     Roger finally wakes up from the loud talking.

     Steve:     WE'RE PRETTY LOW ON FUEL. I'M JUST WAITIN'
               FOR FULL LIGHT SO WE CAN SEE WHAT WE'RE
               LANDIN' IN.

113     In the morning light, several fires can be seen on the ground,
     where buildings are burning.

114     The chopper flies over a National Guard convoy as it chugs up a
     winding country road.

115     Here and there on the ground, human activity can be seen. Search
     and Destroy units, made up of Police, Guardsmen and civilian
     volunteers move across the country side. Occasionally, a Zombie
     is seen staggering through the trees or over a field. Gunfire
     cuts the creature down.

116     Roger:     JESUS. IT'S EVERYWHERE.

     Steve:     WE'RE STILL PRETTY CLOSE TO JOHNSTOWN. WE'RE
               BETTER OFF AWAY FROM THE BIG CITIES.

117     A little country airfield lies quiet in the morning sun. There
     is no sign of life. A few private planes dot the area, but the
     tower is empty. The J.A.S. chopper buzzes very low just outside
     the tower windows.

118     As the whirlybird slowly sets down near the fuel pumps, its
     blades create a wind blast which raises great clouds of dust
     from the dry earth. Sheets of old newspaper and other light
     debris are sent flying through the air in all directions.

119     One piece of torn newsprint blows flat against a window in one
     of the little sheds.  It sticks against the glass for a moment,
     as though glued there, then it flutters to the ground. As the
     paper clears the glass, we see the face of a badly scarred
     Zombie peering out through the window.

120     As the group scrambles out of the helicopter, Stephen
     immediately checks the fuel pumps.

     Steve:     SHIT, MAN, DAMN NEAR EMPTY.

     Roger:     LOTTA PRIVATE PLANES IN FARM COUNTRY LIKE THIS.
               GUESS THEY ALL HIT THE PUMPS AND TOOK OFF.

     Steve:     TO WHERE? WHERE THE HELL CAN THEY GO?

     Peter:     WHERE WE GOIN?

     By now, Steve has drained the dregs from the first pump into the
     chopper's tank, and moved to the second pump. It spurts with
     more force.

     Steve:     THERE'S A GOOD BIT LEFT IN THIS PUMP.

     He stretches the hose toward the chopper but it doesn't quite
     reach.

     Steve:     DAMN. I GOTTA GET IT CLOSER.

121     Steve jumps back into the cockpit and the machine lifts off the
     ground.

122     Fran is watching the action, walking slowly backwards to a small
     rickety hangar area. She turns and looks down to the private
     hangars. Most of them are open wide, the planes they housed long
     gone. One or two of the old wooden double-doors are still closed
     and locked with chains and padlocks. The wind from the chopper
     blades blows her hair and sends more debris flying.

123     Peter kicks open the door to the chart house. The room is dusty
     and dilapidated. A few small chairs surround an old wooden
     table. Several half finished cups of coffee sit on top of
     wrinkled flight charts leaving brown rings on the paper. Flies
     buzz loudly. An old window shade clicks against its window from
     the gusting of the wind and it makes Peter flinch.

     He readies his weapon. When he sees the shade, he steps over to
     it easily, pulls it and lets it roll up on itself. It makes a
     loud, flapping noise.     

124     Outside, the chopper sets down. Roger is ready with the hose
     nozzle. Ducking under the blades he inserts the device into the
     tank receptacle even before Stephen has idled the engine.

     Stephen hops out of the cockpit and shouts over the engine
     noise.

     Steve:     I'M GONNA SEE WHAT'S LEFT IN THE HANGARS.

     He trots off after Fran.

125     In the chart house, Peter idly drops a coin into an old coffee
     machine at one end of the room.  The machine clicks loudly and
     spits out a cup. To Peter's surprise, the cup starts to fill
     with hot brown liquid.

     While he waits. Peter notices a series of notes taped to the
     machine and the surrounding walls. They are all written
     hurriedly in various hands and with all sorts of inks and 
     colours.

               LUCY - GONE TO JOHNSTOWN.
               CHARLES - I HAVE THE KIDS. LEFT WITH BEN.
               COULDN'T WAIT. GONE TO ERIE - JACK FOSTER.

     There are dozens of such messages. Peter takes the full coffee
     cup from the machine. As he sips it, his eyes fall on a closet
     door just across the room. It is moving slightly. It is locked,
     but it bangs against the lock...once...twice...more regularly
     than if caused by the wind drafts.

     Peter steps closer. Now the door bangs violently with a loud
     crash, but it holds. Peter sets his coffee on the chart table
     and takes his rifle in both hands.

     Again the door bangs hard, and a skeleton key is knocked out of
     the keyhole. It falls to the floor with a metallic clang, and
     Peter notices a caked blood stain where blood recently ran out
     of the closet, under the door and onto the linoleum.

     Another bang and a gurgling moan. One of the living dead is
     trying to break out of the closet.

     Quite calmly. Peter raises his rifle and aims it at the door
     about head high. The rifle roars in the little room, and a
     splintery hole appears in the old wooden door.

126     Outside, Fran and Stephen snap to attention at the sound of the
     rifle. Fran stands at the entrance to one of the little wooden
     hangars. Stephen is checking out the cockpit of an old Cessna
     inside. Immediately, Stephen runs out and grabs Fran's hand. As
     they turn the corner to run up the grade to the helicopter, they
     are confronted with two Zombies, staggering slowly towards them
     through the dust cloud from the chopper.

     Fran screams. They have no weapons with them.

     Steve:     ROGER...ROGER...

127     Under the whirling chopper blades, Roger continues to fill the
     fuel tank. In the roar of the engine, he cannot hear anything
     else.

     A third Zombie lumbers toward the helicopter. Roger's back is
     to the creature and he is unaware of the impending danger.

128     Inside the chart house. Peter stares at the closet door. It is
     still for a moment...then another moan and the door bangs again.

     Peter fires two shots, lower right and lower left of the first
     forming a triangle.

129     The two creatures advance slowly on Fran and Steve.

     Steve:     JUST RUN.

     Fran is petrified. She turns and looks behind them. They are
     boxed in by the hangars.

     Steve:     RUN RIGHT PAST 'EM...RIGHT AROUND 'EM.
               THEY CAN'T CATCH YOU.

     She hesitates. The Zombies draw closer.

     Steve:     RUN, FRANNIE. GODDAMMIT, I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU.
               WE CAN HANDLE THEM!

     Fran charges up the little grade. She runs to the right of the
     creatures and they move in her direction, arms outstretched. As
     she draws near to the dead things, she hesitates again in
     fright. The creatures claw at the air. The one in front is
     within a few feet of the woman.

     Steve:     RUN, FRANNIE. MOVE!

     Fran stares into the dead, staring eyes of the lead Zombie. She
     is almost hypnotised. At the last instant, she runs and just
     gets past the creatures. A little up the grade, she turns and
     looks back, stopping again.

     One Zombie turns slowly and starts up the grade after Fran. The
     other continues to advance on Stephen.

130     Stephen ducks back into the open hangar. It is very dark but for
     thin beams of sunlight which cut through between the wooden
     boards of the structure. Stephen roots around among the greasy
     tools which clutter the area. He finds an enormous sledge
     hammer. He runs out of the shed.

131     He dodges around the lead Zombie, who staggers on with inertia.
     Steve sees that Fran is still facing the second creature. The
     man takes a firm grip on the giant hammer as he charges up the
     grade toward the Zombie's back. As he reaches the creature, he
     brings the twenty pound steel head of the sledge slamming
     against the ghoul's skull with all his might.

     The creature staggers on for a few more steps, its head a bloody
     pulp, then it falls to its knees and finally flops face down in
     the dust.

     Without breaking stride, Stephen grabs Fran's hand and the two
     run toward the helicopter. The other Zombie at the hangar has
     turned around and is walking up the grade.

132     Roger is pumping the last drops out of the fuel hose when he
     sees the frightened couple making for the chopper.

133     As Steve charges up the grade he sees the Zombie approaching
     Roger from behind.  Steve shouts and Roger spins around. The
     stumbling creature is very close. It raises its arms and its
     hands clutch at the air. Roger lets the fuel nozzle drop to the
     ground. He is trapped at the side of the machine. He doesn't
     have his rifle. He fumbles with the snap on his hand-gun
     holster.

     Suddenly, the blank face of the Zombie turns red as the top of
     its head seems to disintegrate into a bloody pulp. The creature
     has walked into the spinning chopper blade. Its body staggers
     forward another step or two, then the thing collapses in a heap.

134     Stephen and Fran have reached the chopper. Steve let's go of the
     woman's hand and he drops his bloody sledge to the ground. He
     lunges into the cockpit and snatches up his rifle, ducking in
     the propeller draft.

135     The Zombie which is stumbling up the grade from the hangars
     almost loses its footing, but it regains its balance and
     advances steadily toward the helicopter.

136     The shot misses clean. He fires again. The bullet grazes the
     creature's face. It staggers from the impact, but does not fall.

137     Roger moves quickly for his high powered weapon. Steve fires
     two more rounds.

138     Another miss and another graze, this time on the arm.

139     He is about to shoot once more when Roger stops him, stepping up
     alongside.

     Roger calmly aims and fires one shot cleanly through the
     creatures' brain.

140     The Zombie falls and papers blow over its body.

141     In the chart house. Peter fires several more shots into the
     closet door. Bullet holes appear just where the creature's head
     should be. There seems to be no way that the volley could have
     missed.

     Silence for a moment. Peter still holds his gun high.

     Then, with a great crash, the closet door flies open into the
     room. Two small children burst out. One has no left arm; the
     other has been bleeding from a great wound in his side. They are
     dead. They move directly toward Peter. Their heads are at least
     a foot shorter than the bullet holes in the closet door.

     Peter stares down at the creatures, revulsed.  He is so startled
     that he cannot react quickly enough, and they are on him. The
     moment he feels their clammy grasp, he regains his survival
     instincts. He cannot effectively aim his rifle. He kicks and
     thrashes around. One creature flies against a wall. The other is
     about to bite the man's arm. The big Black grabs the small
     Zombie and flings it physically back. The other creature pounces
     on his back. He throws it over his shoulders and it crashes
     against its brother.

     Now Peter raises his gun. As the children try to scramble to
     their feet the man fires several shots in rapid succession.
     First one creature falls; then the other.

     Peter continues to fire, his eyes wide with desperation and
     disgust. Finally his weapon clicks. It is out of ammunition.

     Peter breathes heavily. He stares at the small corpses.
     Instinctively, he begins loading his weapon, without even
     looking at the action, as he backs wearily out toward the door
     of the chart house.


142     Behind him, in the brightly sunlit doorway, we see the Zombie
     who first appeared at the window. The creature staggers forward.
     Peter turns and startles. He reaches for more shells and backs
     away a few steps as he tries to load the bullets into his gun.
     The creature reaches out and takes another step into the room.

     Peter stares into the creatures eyes. Then suddenly, out in the
     sunlight, a few hundred feet behind the Zombie, Stephen appears
     with his rifle. Peter sees the man over the creature's shoulder.

143     Steve raises his gun and aims at the Zombie, but the barrel
     seems to be on a straight line with Peter.

144     Peter ducks quickly. Steve's gun fires. The bullet misses the
     creature cleanly and crashes into the room. It ricochets off
     the coffee machine. Another shot crashes through the glass in
     the front room.

     Peter crouches, still stuffing shells into his weapon. A third
     of Stephen's bullets tears through the Zombie's shoulder, but
     the creature still stands. It turns toward Peter slowly. Peter
     crawls under the table as another shot splatters into the coffee
     cups.

145     Once again, Roger steps up beside Stephen.  He fires one
     carefully aimed shot, looking through his telescopic range-
     finder.

146     Just as Peter finishes loading his weapon, the Zombie crashes
     into the room, falling over the table and onto the floor.

147     Fran is still kneeling in the dust, trying to keep herself from
     vomiting. Stephen rushes to her side. Roger, keeping his rifle
     poised, shouts toward the chart house.

     Roger:     PETER.

148     The big Black man appears in the doorway, snapping the safety on
     his rifle.

151     Fran's retching causes her to choke and cough. Steve tries to
     comfort her, not knowing what to say and shaking himself.

152     Peter advances with long strides.

153     Stephen looks up when the Black man is a dozen steps away.
     Immediately, he sees the anger in Peter's eyes. The big Trooper
     then raises his rifle and aims it a Stephen. Steve tries to
     stand, but trips and falls on his back in the dust. In an
     instant, Peter is looming over him with the barrel of his rifle
     aimed at point blank range for the shivering man's forehead.

     Fran screams through her choking...

     Fran:     NO...MY GOD...DON'T... WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

     Peter speaks calmly to Stephen, in low tones.

     Peter:     YOU NEVER AIM A GUN AT ANYONE, MISTER.
               IT'S SCARY.
               ISN'T IT?
               ISN'T IT?

     Stephen looks up at the tall man, shivering. Then Peter lowers
     his weapon and extends his hand, helping Stephen up onto his
     feet.

154     Roger clears the fuel hose from around the runners of the
     chopper. Peter climbs into the cockpit and sits in the rear
     without saying another word.

     Roger helps Fran climb aboard. Steve wanders around the front of
     the cockpit bubble and climbs into the Pilot's seat. Roger
     climbs in behind Fran as she squeezes into the uncomfortable
     space beside Peter. The big black offers the woman a sip of
     water, which she accepts. Then she lets her head flop wearily
     against the rear bulkhead.

155     Steve is urgently surveying his flight charts, shuffling the
     papers and trying to seem very busy after the embarrassment of
     the incident.

     Steve:     WE GOTTA FIND FUEL. MAYBE CLOSER TO PITTSBURGH.

     Roger:     NO, WE'VE GOTTA STAY OUT OF THE BIG CITIES.
               IT IT'S ANYTHING LIKE PHILLY WE MIGHT NEVER
               GET OUT ALIVE.

     Peter:     WE MIGHT NOT GET OUT OF ANY PLACE ALIVE.
               WE ALMOST DIDN'T GET OUT OF HERE.

     Roger:     WE'RE GETTIN' OUTA HERE FINE.
               AS LONG AS THERE'S NOT TOO MANY OF THOSE
               THINGS WE CAN HANDLE 'EM EASY.

     Peter:     YEAH, WELL IT WASN'T "THOSE THINGS" THAT
               NEARLY BLEW ME AWAY!

     Stephen turns around and is about to say something angrily.
     Roger stops him by speaking urgently.

     Roger:     WE GOTTA STAY IN THE STICKS. THERE'S BOUND TO
               BE MORE LITTLE PRIVATE AIRPORTS UPSTATE.

     Steve:     (reluctantly going back to his charts)
               THERE'S THE LOCKS ALONG THE ALLGHENY.
               FUEL STATIONS THERE, PRIVATE AND STATE.

     Roger:     PROB'LY STILL MANNED. WE DON'T NEED THOSE
               HASSLES EITHER.

     Steve:     THEY'RE JUST OUT AFTER SCAVENGERS...LOOTERS...

     Peter:     OH, YOU GOT THE PAPERS FOR THIS LIMOUSINE?

     Steve:     (angrily)
               I GOT J.A.S. ID. SO DOES FRAN.

     Peter     RIGHT. AND WE'RE OUT HERE DOIN' TRAFFIC REPORTS?
               WAKE UP, SUCKER. WE'RE THIEVES AND BAD GUYS IS
               WHAT WE ARE. AND WE GOTTA FIND OUR OWN WAY!

     There is a long silence. The engine drones, but the helicopter
     still sits on the ground. The men look at each other. Peter
     takes a long slug of water.

     Fran:     JESUS CHRIST. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE WE'RE
               GOING.  WE DON'T HAVE A RADIO.  WE'RE RUNNING
               OUT OF WATER. WE NEED FOOD....STEPHEN,
               YOU NEED TO SLEEP.

156     We see a wide shot of the little airfield. The J.A.S. chopper
     sits on the ground for a moment, it's props spinning. The, with
     a surge of power, it lifts off and flies away. The dry earth
     swirls up into clouds and blows more bits of paper over the
     wide-eyed corpses which lie in the morning sunlight.

157     We see the facade of an enormous structure. It is a huge,
     suburban shopping mall. The outer walls are all concrete, and
     their clean lines stretch upward for more than two storeys. The
     building looks like a giant domino lying flat on the ground.
     There are only four entrances, and the shops which are housed
     within have no windows opening onto the surrounding lot.

158     In the immense area around the building, lanes and stalls are
     painted for automobile parking. What few cars now dot the area
     are parked randomly, some with their doors open wide.

159     We hear the sound of the helicopter engine fading in, then we
     see the little machine as it approaches and eases down onto the
     roof of the building.

160     In the parking lot, walking among the abandoned vehicles, we see
     several of the living dead.  They look almost like normal
     shoppers at the mall for morning chores, but their lumbering     walk is unmistakably stiff.
161     At one of the mall entrances, we see a revolving door flanked
     by several regularly hinged doors, all made of glass and
     surrounded by large windows. A few of the Zombies manage to     negotiate the hinged doors and enter the building. Others bounce
     off windows and claw the transparent glass in confusion. One
     creature walks around in the revolving door endlessly.

     There are a good many of the creatures, but they are spread out
     and far between. They move with no seeming purpose.
     We do not yet see the mall interior.  The Zombies pay no     attention to the sound of the chopper engine stopping overhead.

162     On the roof, even as the blades of the helicopter still spin,
     the humans are out and moving to the edge of the building. They
     look down at the creatures which dot the parking lot.

     Fran:     OH MY GOD!

     Stephen:     NO CHANCE. FORGET IT, LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.
     Roger:     WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE...THEY CAN'T               GET UP HERE.
     Steve:     YEAH, AND WE CAN'T GO DOWN THERE!

     Roger:     LET'S CHECK IT OUT.
     Roger trots away.
163     Peter has moved directly to an area where a giant grid of
     transparent Plexiglas bubbles face down into the building. He
     stares through one of them and can see into the mall below.
     Roger trots up and peers through another of the bubbles.
     Peter:     MOST OF THE GATES ARE DOWN. I DON'T THINK               THEY CAN GET INTO THE STORES.164     The vantage point only reveals a small aspect of the interior,
     a square plaza with a garden beneath the sunroof of transparent
     bubbles. The space is open all the way down to the garden, which
     is two storeys below. Around the garden on the bottom floor can
     be seen the entrances to several shops. All but one have heavy
     metal cage gates down and locked into position.
     One or two Zombies are seen wandering about. They cannot enter
     the stores, except for the one which is un-gated.

     Halfway up the walls can be seen a balcony railing which rings
     the entire plaza, it is a second storey of shops. The same cage-
     gates seal off the visible store entrances, but none of the dead
     creatures are evident on the balcony.

165     Fran and Stephen come trotting up to the bubbles.

     Roger:     I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THEM UP ON THE SECOND
               FLOOR.

     Peter:     THE BIG DEPARTMENT STORES USUALLY USE BOTH
               FLOORS.

     Roger:     IF WE CAN GET IN UP TOP...

166     Peter is looking across the rest of the expansive rooftop. He
     takes off toward a series of other housings which jut up out of
     the otherwise flat surface. Roger follows.

167     Fran:     (still staring down through a bubble)
               WHAT ARE THEY DOING?
               WHY DO THEY COME HERE?

     Steve:     (also looking down)
               SOME KIND OF INSTINCT. MEMORY...OF WHAT THEY
               USED TO DO. THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT PLACE IN
               THEIR LIVES.

168     Below, the Zombies which are in sight wander aimlessly over the
     plaza. Some try the gates but cannot budge them. One wanders out
     of the single open shop, it is a female. The shop is an
     appliance store. As the creature leaves she drags a toaster idly
     behind her, pulling it by its power cable. It scrapes on the
     floor loudly.

169     We see an installation of large reflectors mounted in an
     intricate metal skeleton which stretches across a large area of
     the roof surface.  Behind the structures can be seen a large
     power generator.

170     Peter:     SOLAR SCREENS.

     Roger:     CAN'T BE ENOUGH TO POWER THIS PLACE.

     Peter:     EMERGENCY SYSTEM, MAYBE.

     Roger:     IT'S PRETTY LIT UP IN THERE.

     Peter:     GUESS THE POWER'S NOT OFF IN THIS AREA.
               A LOT OF PHILLY'S STILL LIT. COULD BE NUCLEAR.

171     Roger:     HEY LOOK AT THIS!

     Roger is peering down through a wire-hatched skylight. There are
     several laid out over this particular area of the roof. He moves
     to another while Peter looks down into the first. Fran and
     Stephen jog up.

     Roger:     THESE DON'T GO DOWN INTO THE MALL.
               WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

     Fran and Stephen peer down into the darkness. Peter pulls a
     flashlight from his utility belt.  He has stayed in full uniform
     all the while, where Roger has stripped off all but his
     ammunition belt and pistol holster.

172     The big man shines a light beam down into the space. The floor
     is only seven feet or so below the window. There is absolutely
     nothing in sight; clear floor, clear walls, all light grey.

     Peter:     DAMN.

173     Roger has moved to another window.

     Roger:     HEY, OVER HERE. THERE'S SOMETHIN' HERE.

174     Peter trots over and shines his beam down. They see a vast
     array of cardboard cartons...hundreds of them.

     Roger:     STORAGE?

175     Peter moves the light beam. Now it illuminates a collection of
     large drums, stacked floor to ceiling and running deep past the
     line of vision. On the face of each drum is the familiar symbol
     of a triangle within a circle, and the letters C.D.

176     Peter:     CIVIL DEFENCE. CIVIL DEFENCE WATER SUPPLY.

     Roger:     AND BOXES OF CANNED FOOD!

     Steve:     HOW DO WE GET DOWN THERE?

     Peter looks at Stephen as a street-wise-tough would look at a
     hopeless city-slick-sissy. Then the big man brings his rifle
     butt down against the glass and the shattered pane crashes to
     the floor below.

177     Inside - the vast space is impressive. It is quite dark but for
     rays of sunlight which drift through the occasional skylights.
     We see an enormous quantity of food cartons and water drums, it
     is very quiet. The space is barren except for the stacks of
     Civil Defence supplies.

178     Suddenly, a figure drops out of one of the skylights, landing on
     its feet in the sunray. It is Peter.     Instantly he readies his rifle, looking this way and that across
     the large room. Silence.

     Peter:     OK.

     He steps aside and Roger climbs in. He too drops cat-like to the
     floor.179     The two men instantly sling their rifles and move to the food
     cartons as by pre-arranged plan. They carry the big boxes
     quickly, one at a time, to the spot under the open skylight.     In a moment, they have built a pyramid out of the cartons. It
     creates a kind of stairway for a quick escape through the window
     above.

180     Now Fran lowers herself into the room and is able to climb down
     the cartons holding onto Roger's hand. She is followed by an
     anxious Stephen.181     Peter has already wandered off. There are only two doors in the
     enormous room, one at either end. The big Trooper moves up to
     one of them as Roger comes up behind him, gun ready.     Peter's hand turns the doorknob. It is unlocked, and the big man
     gives Roger a familiar nod. Roger stands several feet back, his
     rifle aimed directly at the door and ready to fire. Then, with a
     sudden, commando-like motion. Peter throws the door open and
     ducks away flat against the wall. Roger stiffens, his finger all
     but pulling his trigger, but there is no apparent danger.

182     The door opens onto another vast room, equivalent to the one the
     people are in. It also has stacks of C.D. supplies.

     The Troopers cautiously move into the area through the door. The
     room is empty. The same sunrays pierce the darkness through
     skylights. All is dead quiet. This room has no doors at all, but
     for the one Peter opened.
     Roger:     DOUBLE DAMN! LOOKS LIKE A FREE LUNCH, BUDDY.183     In the first room Stephen has started to rip open one of the
     cartons.

     Fran:     SPAM!

     Roger walks back into the room.
     Roger:     YOU BRING A CAN OPENER?

     Fran:     OH.

     Roger:     THEN DON'T KNOCK SPAM. IT'S GOT IT'S OWN KEY.

     The woman flips over the can in her hand and finds the little
     key.

     Peter has walked right past the group.  He is moving quickly
     toward the still-unknown door at the other end of the room.
     Again, Roger follows.

184     At the door, the two Troopers go through the same S.W.A.T.
     procedure. The door swings open, this time onto a very small
     space. Again no immediate danger.

185     As the men enter, they discover that they are on the top landing
     of a concrete and metal firestair. There are no windows, and the
     air is musty. There is one bare light bulb lit in the ceiling,
     but down the stairs at the next landing it is quite dark, and
     there the stairs wind even further down; they recede into
     blackness.

     Roger:     WHATD'YA THINK?

     The Black man just stares, first down into the darkness then
     back into the storage area.

     Roger:     THIS IS THE ONLY WAY UP HERE. WHATD'YA THINK?
               CUT.

186     A great barricade of food cartons has been stacked against the
     stairway door.

187     Near the pyramid under the open skylight, the group of refugees
     sits on the floor.

     Stephen is asleep. Fran sits next to his curled form, her hand
     in his hair. Roger leans against the pyramid and Peter sits in
     the lotus position, his gun across his legs, squarely facing the
     suspicious stairwell. He and Roger still pick at their food.
     Roger swills water from an empty Spam can which he has filled
     from one of the C.D. drums.

     Roger:     YOU BETTER GET SOME SLEEP, TOO, BUDDY.

     Peter:     THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF STUFF DOWN THERE THAT
               WE COULD USE, BROTHER.

     Roger:     I KNOW IT.

     Fran stiffens at the talk.  She doesn't believe what she is     hearing. She knows instantly that the men will try to raid the
     mall.     Peter:     THEY'RE PRETTY SPREAD OUT DOWN THERE.
               IT'S A BIG PLACE. I THINK WE WOULD OUT-RUN 'EM.

     Roger:     HIT AND RUN.

     Peter:     HIT AND RUN... MAYBE GRAB US OFF A RADIO...

     Fran:     YOU'RE CRAZY!     Roger:     THIS PLACE COULD BE A GOLD MINE.
               WE GOTTA AT LEAST CHECK IT OUT.

188     Roger checks his weaponry and quickly moves toward the door
     where he begins to remove the barricade of cartons. Peter still
     sits, checking his own guns.

189     Fran:     THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET AWAY
               FROM...LOOK WHAT HAPPENED AT THE AIRPORT...

     Peter:     THE ONLY PROBLEM AT THE AIRPORT WAS STRAY BULLETS!
               WE COULD OUTFIGHT THOSE DUMMIES BLINDFOLDED.

     Fran:     STEPHEN...(the exhausted Pilot is sleeping through
                    it all)

     Peter:     (standing)
               LEAVE HIM BE. WE'RE GOIN' OURSELVES.

     The big Trooper bends over snatching up Stephen's rifle. He
     snaps off the safety and slams a shell into the chamber. He
     hands it to the woman.     Peter:     THAT'S READY TO SHOOT. BE CAREFUL.
     Fran holds the gun gingerly.     Peter:     THE TRIGGER SQUEEZES REAL EASY, BUT THE WEAPON'LL
               KICK YOU GOOD WHEN IT FIRES. BE READY FOR THAT.

     Fran      WAIT A MINUTE, I...

     Peter:     ANYONE BUT US COMES UP THEM STAIRS, YOU GUYS
               TAKE OFF IN THE MACHINE. WE'LL TRY TO MAKE IT
               OUT TO THE PARKIN' LOT. YOU CAN PICK US UP THERE.

     Fran just stares up at the big man, with desperation in her
     eyes. She has stopped arguing seeing that the Troopers'
     decision is made.

     Peter:     IF WE DON'T SHOW UP AFTER A FEW MINUTES...
               WE'LL CATCH UP TO YOU SOME OTHER TIME.               YOU UNDERSTAND?190     In the dimly lit firestair, the door on the top landing pulls
     open suddenly. The stairway is still empty.     The Troopers move slowly out onto the landing. They look down
     into the darkness below. Then they move slowly and silently down
     the steps. Fran appears on the upper landing. She stands in the
     doorway clutching the rifle.     Peter stops for a moment, looking back up at the frightened
     woman.     Peter:     YOU'LL PROB'LY HEAR SOME SHOOTING.               JUST DON'T PANIC, OK.

     Fran sighs exhaustedly.

     Peter:     YOU'LL BE ALRIGHT. IT'S OUR ASSES THAT'S IN
               THE FIRE.

191     Two landings below, there is almost no light. Roger clicks on
     his flashlight and shines the beam around. He is in a very small
     concrete space. The stairs go down no further. There is only one
     door. Peter eases down the steps behind.     Roger:     THIS IS THE ONLY WAY UP THERE.192     We see the other side of the metal door. It stands in another
     cement walled space, which also seems small from our angle, but
     it is fully lit.     The door opens slowly, and the Troopers cautiously step out. As
     the camera swings around, we see that the men are at the end of
     a long narrow hallway. Directly across from them are two open
     supply rooms, one containing a stationery sink and a toilet.
     Both rooms are filled with cleaning supplies.193     Down along the hall can be seen a dozen or so doorways. Some
     doors are open, some are closed. Along the opposite wall there
     is nothing.     The far end of the hall, about a hundred yards away, opens out
     onto the second story of the mall proper.194     The men look at one another and slowly move down the corridor.
     They try the first two doors, which are locked. The third is
     wide open.
195     Roger ducks quickly into the room with his rifle raised. It is
     a large administrative office, with rows of desks which are
     fully equipped for a staff of secretaries and accountants.196     The next room has a closed door, but it is unlocked. Peter     swings the door open and silently jumps into the room. This is
     a much more spartan area, with two metal desks and a few chairs.
     There are several phones. It is a maintenance office. On one
     wall is a large map of the mall, with pin flags and scribbling
     over an acetate which covers the drawing. At the other end of
     the space is a huge electrical panel with circuit breakers and
     an entire series of master controls all keyed by a number code
     to another map of the mall showing electrical installations.     On the wall behind Peter is a large blackboard and two metal
     cabinets. One is open. It contains all sorts of tools, manual
     and electric. There are circuit testers, walkie talkie units and
     there are several enormous rings containing hundreds of keys,
     also colour and number coded. Peter grabs up one of the rings
     and Roger steps up behind him.     Roger:     THE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM.197     Back in the hallway, Roger's hand tries another doorknob and     throws the door open. This opens onto beautifully plush offices,
     obviously the executive headquarters.     The rooms interconnect, and while Peter walks from door to door
     in the corridor, Roger moves through the inner doors, meeting
     Peter at each room. One office is more elegant than the next,
     with the latest in designer furniture and expensive decorations.198     The Troopers finally reach a room on which both the interior and
     corridor doors are closed and locked. The brass nameplate on the
     interior door reads C.J. Porter - President.199     Roger moves out to the corridor where he joins Peter. They move
     into the exterior corridor. They are very near the end of the
     hall, and the brightly lit shopping area is close at hand. They
     can only see a small section.200     The balcony on their side is railed off against the open drop
     down to the first floor, and across the great cavity they see
     the opposite balcony. On the far side only two store fronts can
     be seen. They are both gated and shut.
201     The two realise what dangers might face them in the mall proper.
     They look at each other and move forward, each clinging to
     opposite walls in the corridor.202     As they reach the mall proper they slowly and carefully peer
     around their respective corners.

203     The upper balcony totally surrounds the vast interior of the
     building, and at several points bridges across from one side to
     the other. Little shops of all types run along the entire length
     of the balcony, and at each far end, stands the entrance arches
     for a large department store.     Most of the stores are gated, but several seem open. The big
     department stores are gated and locked. Here and there tall
     trees grow up from the ground floor and reach up into view of
     the second storey. There are none of the living dead evident on
     the balcony.204     The two troopers move slowly and quietly to the railing. The
     crouch and peer down through the bars of the rail. Below, the
     sight is even more spectacular.205     Stores of every type offer gaudy displays of consumer items.     Everything from clothing to appliances. Photo equipment; audio
     and video outlets; sporting goods and weaponry; gourmet foods
     and natural organic foods. There is a Book Store, a Record
     Store, a Real Estate Agency and a Bank; A Novelty Shop, a Gift
     Shop; all with the absolute latest in American consumer items.
     And at either end of the concourse like the main Altars at each
     end of a Cathedral, stand the mammoth two storey Department
     Stores; great symbols of a consumer society.
     Down the centre of the ground floor, along with the gardens and
     park benches, are little stalls. One is a Tobacco Specialist
     another Jewellery; another is a small Photo Portrait stall where
     mothers had their children photographed. There are restaurants
     and Snack Bars and numerous coin operated machines selling
     everything from children's toys to Blood Pressure readings.
     There is a large turntable, designed to spin but which is now
     still, holding a late model car on exhibit. Another turntable
     displays futuristic household appliances.     The images are all too familiar, but in their present state they
     appear as an archaeological discovery revealing the Gods and
     Customs of a civilisation now gone.

     The ghosts of a civilisation, however, are not figments in the
     mind. They are quite real. And they walk below in the aisles of
     the great Cathedral. At least twenty Zombies can be seen from
     the Troopers' perspective.

206     Roger:     IT'S CHRISTMASTIME DOWN THERE, BUDDY.
     Peter:     FAT CITY, BROTHER. HOW WE GONNA WORK IT.     Roger:     WE GET INTO THE DEPARTMENT STORES UP HERE.               THEY PROB'LY HAVE THEIR OWN ESCALATORS INSIDE.

     Peter:     LET'S CHECK THOSE KEYS.

207     The Troopers stealthily pull away from the railing and back into
     the administrative corridor. Then they move quickly down the
     hall toward the Maintenance Office.

208     As the men leave the balcony, the camera pans. Several yards
     away a Zombie staggers out of one of the open stores. It is
     followed by a second creature, a female without one arm. They     are moving along the balcony toward the open corridor.

209     In the Maintenance Office, the Troopers are checking the keys
     against the coded map on the wall.

     Roger:     SEVENTY TWO...U. AND D. ...HERE IT IS...

     The men check the keys. Peter finds corresponding numbers.

     Peter:     HERE.
     Roger:     LET'S JUST HOPE IT'S RIGHT.     Peter:     LOOK HERE (on the map) THESE NUMBERS MUST ALL
               BE LOCKS (he points) FRONT...SIDE...BACK OUTSIDE,
               MUST BE LIKE LOADING DOCKS...BUT WHAT ARE THESE?

     The man points to several numbered spots which seem to be within
     the big Department Store they are studying.     Roger:     WASHROOMS...EQUIPMENT...I DUNNO.     Roger moves off toward the electrical control panel. Peter still
     stares at the map.     Peter:     I GUESS THESE GOTTA BE THE GATES.
     Roger:     HOW ABOUT A LITTLE MUSIC?
     Peter:     WHAT?210     The big Black moves up behind his partner. One of the controls
     on the panel is marked: MUSIC TAPE. It indicates a master switch
     which is in the off position. Another is marked FLOOR EXHIBITS
     and a series of others are marked ESCALATORS. There are dozens
     of master switches which are in the off mode.
     Peter:     POWER SWITCHES.
     Roger:     THE MUSIC MIGHT COVER THE NOISE WE MAKE.     Peter:     HIT 'EM ALL. MIGHT AS WELL HAVE POWER IN               EVERYTHING. WE MIGHT NEED IT.

     Roger hits the switches one at a time.

211     Throughout the mall, we hear the drone of the dull, mass
     produced music designed to lull a shopper's brain.212     Upstairs, Francine startles at the sound from below. She snaps
     the rifle into her hands, ready to fire. She has been standing
     just inside the storage area. She steps into the firestair and
     looks down into the darkness. The sounds of the insipid music
     drift up to her. She leans into the storage area again.

     Fran:     STEPHEN...
               STEPHEN!

213     Steve, still lying on the floor against the escape pyramid,
     slowly awakens.214     Down on the first floor of the big mall, things begin to work.
     The automobile turntable starts spinning; the great escalators
     move up and sown. Two of the living dead, caught just starting
     up two stalled escalator, fall and roll down as the mechanical
     steps begin moving.

     Lights blink on the exhibits, and mechanical window displays
     begin their robot-like motions. It is like a Carnival coming
     alive. The Zombies which wander the floor look about in
     confusion. Some of them swat ineffectively at the moving
     exhibits.215     In a very tall cage, which reaches from the first floor all the
     way to the ceiling, the Tropical Birds which are housed within
     begin to flutter and squawk.216     In a pet shop, there are puppies and kittens in a window
     display. They whine and scramble over one another in fright at
     the noise and the motion and the coloured lights.217     On one of the floor exhibits, a rear-projection movie starts. It
     is a dryly produced film about the merits of a Real Estate
     Developer's new tract of suburban houses. A narrator speaks in a
     friendly voice:
               ... and for prices which anyone can afford,               you can live in these luxurious new homes
               by Brandon. Fully electric, central air, ..etc.

218     In the Maintenance Office, the Troopers ready themselves for
     their raid. Peter secures the vital key ring to his utility     belt and the move out.

     Peter and Roger move down the Hall and exit through door to
     exterior corridor.

219     Just as Roger moves through the door into the corridor, he is
     confronted by the Zombies from the balcony. He startles and
     ducks back into the room. The closest Zombie is reaching out
     with clutching hands. Peter raises his gun and fires two shots
     cleanly through the creature's head.220     As the shots ring through the area, Fran, standing at the top of
     the firestair, startles. Steve grabs the rifle from the woman.

     Steve:     JESUS CHRIST...
               THEY'RE MANIACS.

221     The Troopers step over the corpse. The second Zombie, the
     arm less female, is walking toward them. This time Roger fires
     his weapon. The creature falls in a heap.     Roger:     WHATD'YA THINK? BAG IT OR TRY FOR IT?
     Peter:     YOU GAME?     Roger nods and the two men run down the hall toward the mall.     Their rifles poised, they are like commandos on an important
     mission.

     The men at the mall mouth see the department store and start for
     it. They run from the corridor onto the balcony.222     The battle to win the mall has begun. The creatures which wander
     the first floor look about, attracted by the sound, but they are
     confused. They walk this way and that, in mis-guided staggering
     strides.223     Several of the Zombies try to move up the down-escalator. They
     fall over themselves and cannot negotiate the moving stairway.224     A few creatures who move onto the up-escalator also fall against
     each other from the movement, but one falls onto the moving
     steps and is carried upward. Then another manages to keep its
     balance holding on to the hand rail.
225     At another point down the length of the mall, there is a
     stationary stairway which runs from the first to the second     floor. Several creatures move up the steps.

226     At the top of the firestair, Stephen begins to move down the
     steps cautiously. His rifle is at the ready. Fran stays on the
     top landing.     Fran:     STEPHEN, DON'T GO DOWN THERE.               (he continues)
               STEPHEN PLEASE!

     Steve:     IT'S ALRIGHT.

227     At the huge gate which locks off the big Department Store,
     the two Troopers come to a crashing stop.

228     There is a side concourse which can be seen from this vantage
     point, and in the hall are four or five Zombies. They are about
     three hundred feet away.

229     Roger keeps his rifle levelled off in the direction of the
     creatures while Peter confronts the lock at the middle of the
     big roll gate.     He fumbles with the keys for a moment until he finally sinks     the proper key into the receptacle which is right at the floor.     The tumblers turn successfully.     Peter:     ALRIGHT!

230     On the escalator, the creatures which fell onto the moving steps
     are being carried up to the balcony. The one supporting himself
     on the hand rail is still standing. The head of the standing
     Zombie suddenly becomes visible from Roger's perspective.

231     The Trooper raises his gun and aims for the creature's forehead.

     Peter tries to life the roll gate. It won't move. It is still
     locked.     Peter:     YOU BASTARD!
     Roger:     WHAT?

     Peter:     STILL LOCKED...(he sees another assembly)
               ON THE SIDE...

     The big man moves to the far side of the gate. The same key
     fits. Roger re-focuses on the creature which is riding the
     escalator. It is quite near the top now. Roger is about to
     shoot when something catches his eye.

232     The fallen Zombies, which up to now could not be seen behind the     escalator rail wall, suddenly come tumbling out onto the balcony
     floor.233     Roger fires, but his aim is inaccurate.234     He hits the standing Zombie in the neck. The creature is thrown     off balance enough to lose its footing. It falls back down the
     escalator, but before it reaches the bottom, it stops rolling.
     The steps carry it back up toward the second floor again. It is
     still very much alive. The two creatures on the balcony struggle
     to stand.235     Roger looks back over his shoulder.236     The Zombies from the side concourse are now about a hundred and
     fifty feet away.

237     Peter turns the key in the lock, but again the gate will not
     lift. It moves slightly, as the middle mechanism and the one on
     the far right are free, but there is a third lock on the far
     left. Peter moves to it quickly.238     On the first floor concourse, other creatures are beginning to     take note of the action upstairs. They start to move.239     The Zombies on the stationary stairway are beginning to reach
     the second floor, but they are far down the main balcony. They
     will have to pass the administrative corridor in order to reach
     the Department Store.

240     Roger fires again.

241     One of the nearby Zombies falls in a heap.

242     At the sound of the rifle, Fran gets desperate.

     Fran:     STEPHEN...FOR GOD'S SAKE...LET'S GET UP ON THE
               ROOF...243     Steve is at the middle landing. He stares down into the darkness
     below. More gunfire can be heard from the mall.

     Steve:     IT'S ALRIGHT, I'M TELLIN 'YA. THOSE THINGS               DON'T MOVE FAST ENOUGH TO CATCH US.     More gunfire can be heard.244     Now the giant gate rolls up with a loud rumble. Peter ducks into
     the store even as the gate is still rising, but the inertia of
     the great metal cage carries the lip up out of Peter's grasp. He
     jumps to try to catch it, but he misses. It jerks up into its
     fully open position and rolls back down slightly, but still
     Peter cannot reach the lip. It slides back to rest about three
     feet above Peter's fingertips.245     The Zombies advance.246     Roger drops another with a clean shot through the head, then he
     backs into the archway of the Department Store entrance. Peter
     is desperately looking around for something to stand on to reach
     the gate.247     The Zombies are very close to the arch now, advancing steadily.

248     Peter grabs a small counter used to display shoes, but it is too
     heavy for him to move himself.

     Peter:     HERE...COME ON...

     Roger has to abandon his post at the arch long enough to help
     drag the little counter. The men drag it to a point just at the
     side of the open arch, and Peter instantly jumps up on the top
     of it. At that instant, a Zombie rounds the corner and grabs at
     Peter's legs. The big man kicks, startled, and the motion causes
     him to fall off the little counter. He lands on his feet, but
     out on the balcony beyond the arch. Roger brings his rifle butt
     around against the creature's head and the Zombie falls back,
     but is not dead.

     Other creatures are only a few feet from Peter, whose gun sits
     on the little counter inside the store. Roger levels off his
     rifle but cannot fire as Peter is in the line. Peter makes a
     move and, like a football player, jukes to the left, then to the
     right. He dives right at one of the creatures carrying it into
     the store.     Now Roger fires, dropping one, then another. Peter jumps back up     on the counter.     Peter:     BEHIND YOU...BEHIND YOU...

     The creature in the store has crashed against a cosmetics
     display and is regaining its footing. Roger turns and fires. The     creature falls. Peter grabs the lip of the roll gate and starts
     to bring it down.

     There are several creatures right in the archway, now they
     clutch with their hands. One blocks the downward progress of the     gate. Roger fires point blank and the Zombie flies back. The
     gate lowers but is stopped by the clutching hands of other
     creatures. Roger grabs the cage now and helps to pull it down.
     Peter, still gripping the lip, jumps off the counter to get more
     leverage.     The bottom of the gate is now four feet from the floor. The two
     men are able to move it steadily downward. The Zombies are very
     weak, but more creatures appear making it more difficult. Then
     one Zombie tries to crawl under the gate. Its torso just gets
     through as the gate slams down against its chest. Its arms grab
     for Peter's legs and its mouth is gasping. Its body is
     preventing the gate from engaging in the floor mechanisms.     Roger lets go the cage as Peter tries to hold it against the
     creatures outside. Grabbing his rifle, Roger brings the butt
     straight down on the clutching Zombie's skull. The Zombie goes
     limp. Then Roger tries to push the creature clear of the gate,
     but the pressure is too great.
     Roger:     LET UP A LITTLE...LET UP A LITTLE...

     The gate rises a few inches. More Zombies appear outside. Their
     hands clutch at the roll gate. The openings in the grid are only
     big enough for their fingers, their hands can't reach through,
     but they are pushing the gate higher and higher...more than
     Peter intended to clear the obstructing corpse.     With his rifle butt, Roger manages to push the dead Zombie clear
     except for one of its arms. From outside, a creature's hand
     suddenly grabs Roger's weapon. For a moment its like a Tug-O-War.
     Peter is having a harder time holding the gate. It is inching
     upward.     Peter:     COME ON...COME ON...     Roger lets go his gun barrel and the weapon is snatched away by
     the creature in the crowd. Roger grabs for the gate.     Peter:     THE ARM...THAT ARM'S IN THE WAY.     Roger squats again and manages to throw the dead Zombie's arm     clear. Then he grabs the gate again. Now it starts to move down
     more steadily.     At the last moment, another clutching arm juts into the store,
     but when the gate hits it, it withdraws, and the big cage clicks
     solidly into place.

     The two Troopers step back from the gate. The creatures still
     moan and gurgle, slamming against the gate, their fingers
     clutching at the grid, but they are unable to budge it.
     There are ten or twelve Zombies trying to get into the
     Department Store and several others are making their way along
     the balcony. At least six lie dead along the floor.     Roger:     WELL...WE'RE IN...NOW, HOW THE HELL WE GONNA               GET BACK?     Peter:     LET'S GO SHOPPIN' FIRST.

     The two men back into the aisles of the store. The creatures
     outside still push and claw at the gate. The one with Roger's
     rifle uses it as a bludgeon, but it has no effect.

249     Stephen opens the door into the Administration corridor.

250     From his perspective, the hall is inactive. He observes the
     washrooms and the long row of doors to the various offices.

251     He starts into the corridor, letting the firestair door close.

252     At the top of the firestair, Fran can see the beam of light from
     the open door below. As the door closes, the beam narrows, then
     it blinks out with a click as the door closes.     Fran:     STEPHEN...JESUS GOD...

     She is very frightened.  She backs into the storage area.253     She moves quickly to the pyramid of cartons which lead to the     roof. She sits on the bottom carton biting her fingers.254     In the Department Store, Roger is riding down an escalator. He
     has found a back pack, and it is obviously already filled with
     goods. As he steps off the moving stairs on the ground floor,
     the surroundings are eerily quiet.255     He moves through a clothing department. We see the dead looking
     faces of store mannequins. Roger runs into one and is greatly
     startled. He snatches up a lined windbreaker and ties it around
     his waist by its arms, then he trots off down another aisle,
     where he finds Peter.

256     The big Trooper has a radio under his arm and he is snatching up
     a small television.

     Roger:     HEY MAN, WE CAN'T CARRY ALL THIS SHIT...

257     Peter turns a corner and dumps the articles into something
     which we cannot yet see. As Roger trots up, he sees that Peter
     has a big gardening cart already heaped with goods.
     Roger:     OH...WE'RE GONNA JUST WHEEL RIGHT BY 'EM, RIGHT?     Peter:     WE GONNA TRY, BROTHER. WE AIN'T DOIN' THIS
               FOR THE EXERCISE. WE MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO
               GET WHAT WE CAN.

     Roger:     THERE'S NO WAY THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN...

     Even though he doesn't understand the plan, Roger helps Peter
     toss things into the barrow.

258     They race down the hardware aisle tossing in tools and other
     supplies. Electrical cables, flashlights, batteries. They scoop
     things up like contestants on a game-show who have five minutes
     in a store to grab whatever they can.259     Stephen is in the Maintenance office. He examines the maps and     electrical equipment, then rummages through a desk.260     At the open end of the corridor leading to the second storey
     balcony, Zombies wander past as they head for the Store entrance
     where many creature still claw at the roll gate.261     The Zombies move randomly. Some are leaving the gate as their     prey is now out of sight. They begin to wander here and there.

262     Three of the creatures turn into the administrative corridor and
     start toward the offices.

263     Stephen has found a large binder in the desk. It contains all
     the plans for the mall, duplicating the charts on the walls and
     many others. It is a complete maintenance manual revealing all
     the workings and layout of the huge structure.264     Elevator doors slide open with a loud whoosh. The two Troopers
     appear in the car, wheeling their barrow out onto the second
     storey aisles of the big store.265     Now, they can see the roll gate and the creatures pushing at it
     ineffectively. They roll their barrow very close to the gate.
     When the Zombies catch sight of the humans, their efforts are
     renewed. They moan and push harder at the gate.266     They Troopers leave the barrow, disappearing back to the aisles.     They run onto the interior escalator, bounding down faster than
     the moving steps, then they run across the first floor until
     they see the lower level-roll gate.267     There are creatures wandering the concourse, but none of them     are at the gate.     Peter:     LET'S GO BROTHER...THE OLD OKEY DOKE!

     The men move up to the roll gate. A Zombie lumbers past. Roger
     speaks to the creature.

     Roger:     HEY, UGLY!

     The creature turns instantly. Registers. Then dives for the
     gate with a moaning roar. Its mouth opens and its hands clutch.
     The gate pops forward from the creature's thrust, but it holds
     tightly. The action causes Roger to jump even though there is no
     immediate danger.     Peter:     LET'S RAISE SOME HELL...HEY...HEY...
               (he is shouting)

     Roger:     OVER HERE...LET'S GO OVER HERE...

268     Other creatures along the concourse turn toward the Department
     Store. They lumber along attracted by the sounds.

269     At the gate, several Zombies push at the metal grids. The
     Troopers back away, but stay in sight of the creatures.

     Peter:     JUST GIVE IT TIME ...GIVE IT TIME.

270     Upstairs, the Zombies at the upper gate are attracted by the
     commotion below. They begin to move away from the gate and
     lumber along the balcony to the stairways and escalators.

271     In the maintenance office, Stephen still rummages. He finds a
     loaded hand gun and stuffs it in his belt. He moves to the large
     cabinets containing the walkie talkies and the keys.272     In the corridor, the stray Zombies move in and out of the
     executive offices as they draw nearer to the Maintenance room.273     Several creatures fall over one another as they try to move down
     the up escalator. The down escalator push others onto the first
     floor. They scramble to their feet and move toward the
     Department Store.
274     In the concourse, many creatures are moving toward the gate.
     Already there are a dozen or so clutching and pushing at the
     metal grid. Through the crowd. Peter can see several other
     creatures lumbering down the stationary steps.

275     Peter:     OK...THEY 'RE COMIN'...

     The big man readies his walkie talkie, pulling the antenna out.     Peter:     GO ON UP...STAY OUTTA SIGHT BUT LEMME KNOW               WHEN ITS CLEAR ENOUGH.     Roger, clutching his walkie talkie, disappears among the aisles
     as he runs, crouching, into the store. Peter tries to hold the
     attention of the creatures at the gate.     Peter:     RIGHT HERE, BABIES...THIS IS WHERE IT'S AT...
               YOU DUMB ASS SUCKERS...YOU DUMB...YOU ARE DUMB!

276     Upstairs, the doors to the elevator glide open again and Roger
     moves through the second floor aisles stealthily.277     Stephen takes the maintenance manual and leaves the office. He
     walks down the interior corridor and opens the door to the
     exterior corridor. As the door opens, the Zombies attack. The
     Zombies clutch as Stephen tries to close the door on Zombie 13's
     arm. Stephen then runs back down the interior corridor.

278     Stephen starts up the firestair to the door. Just then he hears
     Fran call out. Realising he will lead the creatures to her, he
     closes the door and moves toward the Maintenance office and runs
     in.

279     Stephen runs into the office and slams the door.

280     A second creature is moving up behind the first, and another
     enters the corridor from the accounting office.

281     The metal door locks only with a key. Stephen fumbles for a
     moment with his rifle, then dives for the key cabinet. There are
     hundreds of keys on rings. He looks at the wall map. He can't
     focus in his panic.

282     In the hall, the first creature slams against the floor. It
     doesn't even have the intelligence to reach for the knob. It
     pounds on the door with its hands.

283     The pounding increases Stephen's panic. He stares at the map
     trying to focus on the maze of numbers.

284     The second creature reaches the door and claws at it. The third
     approaches slowly.

285     Stephen rattles among the keys. His fingers shake and he cannot
     decipher the numbers.

286     Outside, one of the creatures, in its random clutching, takes
     hold of the knob and pushes in and out, not yet turning it.

287     Stephen, clutching one of the rings, throws himself against the
     door, still trying to read the numbers. The knob finally turns.
     The door opens against Stephen's weight. He manages to slam it
     shut despite the pushing creatures. He throws the key ring down
     and grabs his gun.

288     Roger speaks into his walkie talkie:

     Roger:     I THINK WE CAN MOVE THE WAGON.

289     Peter, downstairs, talks into his unit:

     Peter:     CLEAR?

     Roger:     (over talking unit)
               NOT ALTOGETHER, BUT THEY'RE SPREAD OUT PRETTY
               GOOD...ENOUGH TO MOVE THE WAGON.

     The creatures slam against the first floor gate, but it holds
     securely. Peter stares at the beasts as he lowers his talk
     unit. He backs slowly away into the depths of the store.

290     Upstairs, Roger peers from behind a counter.

291     The second floor gate is clear.

292     On the balcony, several creatures wander aimlessly, but most of
     them have already moved down the steps and escalators.

293     Peter is still in sight of the Zombies at the first floor
     entrance. He clips his talk unit onto his belt, then ducks and
     disappears among the aisles.

294     He runs, crouching out of sight, until he rounds a far wall
     and comes up into the elevator.

295     He enters the car and pushes "2". The doors glide shut and the
     car begins to move up.

296     At the door of the Maintenance Office, the knob turns again. The
     door pushes open against Stephen weight. His feet slide on the
     linoleum floor. He cannot get the door closed this time. Biting
     his lip, he makes the sign of the cross, and backs suddenly into
     the room holding his rifle high. The door flies open with a
     slam, and three Zombies advance into the office. Stephen tries
     to aim carefully, and he fires.

297     Just as the elevator doors open. Peter hears the gunfire. He
     hesitates for a moment, then runs toward the entrance arch.

298     Roger is poised at one of the side locks on the gate. The
     gunfire stops him also as he is unlocking the mechanism.

299     Along the balcony, some of the creatures turn around in con-
     fusion. They walk this way and that, attracted  by the sound.

300     Peter thunders up behind Roger.

     Peter:     WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

     Roger:     FUZZ MAYBE?

     Peter:     OR MAYBE FLYBOY. WHERE'S IT COMIN' FROM?

     Roger:     CAN'T TELL.

     Peter:     COME ON. OPEN UP.

     Roger :      MAYBE WE SHOULD SEE WHAT'S HAPPENIN'...

     Peter:     OPEN UP. I CAN GET THE WAGON OVER. IF IT
               IS FLYBOY, LET'S GET HIM ON OUR SIDE.

     Roger moves to the second lock. More gunfire.

     Peter:     (setting his weapon on the floor)
               YOU JUST COVER ME GOOD, YOU HEAR?

     Roger moves to the third lock as Peter stands and grabs on to
     the handles of the barrow.

301     The body of a dead Zombie hits the floor, its head shot
     through. Nearby lies the corpse of the first creature to break
     into the Maintenance Office.

     The third staggers into the room. Stephen stands fast now. He
     holds his rifle out in front of him. The creature walks toward
     the gun. Steve holds his hands on the trigger. The Zombie lunges
     suddenly, and grabs the gun barrel. Steve fires, but the blast
     tears through the creature's chest. Steve struggles to raise the
     barrel but the motion of the Zombie makes it impossible to aim
     accurately. The gun fires again, this time grazing the Zombie's
     neck. With a sudden burst of energy the creature wrenches the
     gun free. Steve backs against the wall. The creature tosses the
     rifle across the room where it slams the floor near a desk. The
     Zombie advances on Steve. Steve is next to the key cabinet and
     grabs at it, trying to find some weapon. He feels the tools in
     the cabinet and comes up with a hammer. The Zombie is about to
     reach him when Steve pulls the hammer out and upsets the
     cabinet. The Zombie fumbles with the cabinet at its feet, but
     doesn't fall. Steve tries to hit the creature's head with the
     tool, he misses and the Zombie grabs at his arm, trying to bite
     it. Steve wrenches free and the two bodies fall to the floor.
     The creature clutches at the man's legs, it's teeth bared like
     an animal. Steve kicks desperately and manages to land a blow
     squarely in the creatures face. The Zombie comes after him again
     and from his crawling position, Steve brings the hammer as an
     uppercut to the creature's jaw. The creature falls back enough
     for Steve to crawl across the floor. It follows, but Steve
     reaches the desk and grabs his rifle. Rolling on the floor, he
     fires several shots into the creature, finally destroying it.

302     The second floor gate rolls up with a rumble and Peter runs out
     of the Department Store with the barrow full of supplies.

303     The action attracts the attention of several of the creatures
     which are still wandering the balcony. They turn slowly.

304     Just as he rounds the corner. Peter almost collides with one
     creature, and can barely keep from upsetting the barrow. He
     manages to get past, and he runs as fast as he can toward the
     opening of the Administrative corridor.

305     Roger does not let the gate roll up too high. He stabilises the
     metal grid well within reach, then he stands his post with
     Peter's rifle. Several creatures approach from the opposite
     direction. Roger fires at the closest one. It falls. The others
     are still too far away to waste bullets.

306     Stephen steps over the corpses in the office and grabs the
     maintenance manual. He rushes into the corridor and runs out.

307     Three more creatures move toward him up the hallway.

308     At first Stephen freezes, then he starts backing toward the
     firestair, his rifle poised.

309     Just as Peter is reaching the mouth of the corridor, a Zombie     steps out of the hallway into his path. Peter slams the barrow
     squarely into the creature's legs. The Zombie falls in the
     barrow onto the supplies. The big man slams the load against a
     wall at the mouth of the corridor. Before the Zombie can get its
     balance, the big Trooper reaches down and grabs the creature's
     jacket lapels. With all his might he flings the creature out
     against the balcony railing. The creature flips over the rail,
     but does not fall. Its arms and legs flailing as Peter comes up
     quickly behind and flips it over the rail. The creature makes no
     sound as it plummets to the concourse below.310     Roger fires again at a Zombie drawing dangerously near. Other     creatures throughout the area are again converging on the
     Department Store entrance.311     Peter wheels the barrow into the corridor and sees Steve at the     other end, the three Zombies are still closing in.     Peter:     HOLD IT FLYBOY!312     Steve freezes. He can barely see Peter, his vision blocked by
     the Zombies. The creatures are about thirty feet away.313     Peter:     DON'T GO INTO THE STAIRWAY!314     Stephen is confused. The creatures advance.315     Peter:     DON'T OPEN THAT DOOR, BABY. YOU'LL LEAD 'EM
               RIGHT UP WITH YOU.

316     Steve is on the verge of panic.

     Peter:     RUN FOR IT.  RUN THIS WAY.
     The Zombies are drawing closer and closer.317     Peter:     COME ON, MAN. RUN THIS WAY. YOU CAN RUN RIGHT
               THROUGH 'EM. WE GOTTA LEAD 'EM AWAY FROM HERE!

318     Steve sizes up the corridor. It is narrow, but there is room to
     run past the Zombies.

319     Peter:     COME ON, FLYBOY. YOU CAN MAKE IT. COME ON!

320     With a sudden move, Steve breaks into a run. He passes the first     creature easily. The second grabs him as he runs past, but the
     man keeps his footing even though he slams against the wall. He
     keeps moving forward. The third creatures stands in his path.
     Steve lowers his head and slams into the Zombie's chest. The
     creature flies back and falls. Steve falls and tumbles toward
     the mouth of the passageway. He regains his footing as the
     creatures turn to pursue him, he runs to the end of the hall
     where Peter waits.     Peter:     NOW...HEAD FOR THE DEPARTMENT STORE...GO!321     The two men run across the balcony. They slam into two other     Zombies which clutch and grab at them without success.

322     At the entrance arch to the store, Roger fires at another
     creature. It falls. Other Zombies are approaching, but Steve and
     Peter dive into the arch and the three men manage to lower the
     gate without a problem.

     The Zombies converge on the area as they did before, clutching
     and pushing at the metal cage, which holds them out securely.

     The men breathe heavily as they back away from the gate.

     Peter:     DOWNSTAIRS AGAIN ...SAME TRICK.

323     The men move through the aisles of the store and go crashing
     down the escalator.

324     On the first floor they run toward the lower gate where they
     pull up wheezing with exhaustion.

     Steve:     WHAT DO WE DO...

     Roger:     LET 'EM KNOW WE'RE HERE...
               (shouting)
               WHOOOO HOOOOOO...OVER HERE...YEEE HAAAAAAAA.     Steve starts to laugh at the ludicrous situation. Peter smiles
     at the young pilot.

     Peter:     YOU DID ALRIGHT THIS TIME FLYBOY.
               HOW 'BOUT IT?

     Stephen laughs some more, nervously at first, then whole-
     Heartedly. Then he lets out a loud:

     Steve:     WHOOOOOOOOOOOPEEEEEEEEE...

     He has joined the cowboys. He is like a child, almost exultant
     with the joy of their victory...
     The three men shout through the cage at the creatures, which are     already gathering at the gate.

325     Out on the concourse, a few Zombies wander aimlessly, but most
     are heading for the commotion on the first floor arch.

326     On the upstairs balcony, Zombies again move toward the
     stationary steps and the escalators.

327     The three creatures in the Administration corridor move toward
     the open mall. Two walk out on the balcony, but the last one
     turns into an open office. Then it staggers back out and heads
     down the hall toward the firestair.

328     Fran can faintly hear the "whooping" of the men as she moves
     toward the stairway door, which is still open.329     She steps onto the landing and looks down into the darkness. The     shouting stops. Desperate with fear, she moves back to the
     storage room, then back onto the landing. Now her fear turns
     into anger.     Fran:     SHIT...     She takes a few steps down the stairs. Stops. Goes back up.
     Fran:     GOD DAMMIT!
     She starts back down again.

330     In the corridor below, the creature walks into another office.
     Then it moves back into the hall.

331     The Zombies crash against the first floor gate. It holds. The
     men crouch in the shadows of the gate.

     Roger:     WE JUST GOTTA WAIT LONGER BEFORE WE MOVE.

     Peter:     NO. THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE OF SOME OF THEM
               STAYIN' UP ON THE BALCONY.

     Roger:     YEAH, BUT WE CAN HANDLE THAT.  WE CAN BREAK THROUGH.

     Peter:     IF ANY OF THEM SEE OR HEAR US, THEY'LL JUST
               FOLLOW US ON UP.  IT'S NO GOOD.

     Roger:     WE CAN SURE AS HELL OUT RUN 'EM...LOAD UP WHAT
               WE CAN AND GET OUTTA HERE.

     Peter:     I'M THINKIN' MAYBE WE GOT A GOOD THING GOIN' HERE.
               MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T BE IN SUCH A HURRY TO LEAVE.     Roger:     OH, MAN...     Peter:     IF WE COULD GET BACK UP THERE WITHOUT THEM               CATCHIN' ON, WE COULD HOLE UP FOR A WHILE.
               AT LEAST LONG ENOUGH TO CATCH A BREATH.
               CHECK OUT THE RADIO. SEE WHAT'S HAPPENIN'...     Roger:     MAN, I DON'T KNOW...     Steve:     THERE'S SOME KIND OF PASSAGEWAY OVER THE TOP
               OF THE STORES.

     The Troopers look at the young pilot, almost surprised to hear
     him speak.  He has been quiet up until now.

     Steve:     I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S JUST HEATING DUCTS OR
               IF IT'S SOME KIND OF ACCESS. I SAW IT ON A MAP.

     Peter:     UPSTAIRS.  LET'S GO.

     The three move off down the aisles, then duck out of sight
     around a corner. The Zombies clutch at the metal gate, moaning
     and rattling the grid loudly.332     In the Maintenance hallway, we see the thick manual lying on the     floor. A lumbering foot kicks it as the Zombie in the corridor
     wanders into another office. The creature ignores the book, as
     it does the corpses strewn in the hall.333     In the fire stair, Fran is on the middle landing. She is
     suddenly overcome with a wave of nausea. She clutches at her     stomach, retching. She sits on the landing, letting her head
     flop against the wall. She is almost in tears.334     The upstairs doors of the Department Store elevator open and the     men trot out. As they clear a wall, they see the entrance arch.335     There are no Zombies at the gate, but two are seen drifting
     along the balcony outside.

336     Peter:     WATCH IT...DON'T LET 'EM SEE YOU.

     The men move stealthily along the aisles. They look up at the
     ceiling and see a series of large grillwork panels. Peter shines
     his flashlight beam into one.
337     The ceiling is about twelve feet high, but the light beam     penetrates the grille to reveal a fairly large space above.338     Roger:     LOOKS BIG ENOUGH TO CRAWL THROUGH.     Peter:     THEY'RE LOCKED.

     Roger:     DAMN. THAT'S THOSE OTHER LOCK NUMBERS WE
               SAW ON THE CHART.

     Steve:     WHY THE HELL WOULD THEY BE LOCKED?

     Peter:     JACKPOT, FLYBOY. YOU'RE RIGHT.
     Roger:     WHAT?     Peter:     THEY'RE LOCKED BECAUSE YOU CAN GET THROUGH               'EM EASY FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE BUILDING.     Steve:     OVER HERE.339     Steve notices that one of the ceiling grids is very close to the
     elevators. Peter looks at the grids, then down at the double
     doors.     Peter:     THE ELEVATOR SHAFT!
     He moves over and hits the button. The doors open.
     Peter:     HOLD 'EM.     Roger stands against the rubber safety bumper, holding the car
     doors open wide. Peter steps onto the hand railing and reaches
     up for the escape hatch, which is held in place by four knub-
     headed bolts. He removes the bolts quickly and dislodges the
     hatch cover and passes it down to Stephen.     Then the big man sticks his head up through the opening.340     He looks around the elevator shaft, shining his flash this way     and that. He sees another grid in the shaft wall.

     Peter:     IT'S HERE...AND IT AIN'T LOCKED. GET A SCREW-
               DRIVER AND SOMETHIN' TO STAND ON FOR IN HERE.

341     Roger:     I KNOW WHERE THE TOOLS ARE. GET ONE OF THOSE
               TABLES.

     Roger ducks off down an aisle and Steve moves to the nearby
     furniture department and grabs a lightweight lamp table. The
     elevator doors close. When Steve returns with the table he has
     to hit the button again. The doors open. Peter is already
     climbing out of the car into the shaft. Steve uses the table to
     hold the doors open and goes to get another.
     This time he gets a larger coffee table and sets it under the
     opening in the car and puts the smaller table on top. He climbs
     up and sticks his head out into the shaft. The doors close
     again.342     In the greasy black shaft, amid the cables and elevator     mechanisms. Peter examines the wall grid with his flashlight.     Peter:     IT'S ALRIGHT...WE CAN GET IT OFF.
               YOU FOUND IT FLYBOY.

     Even though he speaks softly, Peter's voice has an eerie,
     echoing sound in the narrow shaft.

343     The car doors open. Steve ducks down to see Roger bearing a
     screwdriver and pliers along with some other tools in a shopping
     bag.     Roger:     ONE-STOP SHOPPING ...ANYTHING YOU NEED RIGHT               AT YOUR FINGERTIPS.344     Steve relays the tools up to Peter, who immediately begins to
     work on the screws which mount the grid. He passes the
     flashlight to Steve who holds the beam on the work area.345     Fran sits in the stairwell, her hand over her mouth. It is very
     quiet for a moment, then she hears a slight clicking. Her head
     snaps to attention. She stares down at the bottom landing. There
     is a thump at the door.     Slowly the woman stands to her feet, her eyes transfixed on the
     door below.     Fran:     STEPHEN!

     The door starts to open. Light creeps in. The slow, lumbering
     figure of the Zombie moves into the firestair. Choking back a
     scream, Fran turns and runs up the stairs. The creature below
     follows, unsure of itself in the dim light.

346     At the top, Fran makes it into the storage area and slams the
     door. For a moment, she just backs away in terror. Then she
     gathers her wits and moves to drag the food cartons over as a
     barricade. She struggles with one of the cartons. It is very
     heavy and so large she cannot get a good grip. The smooth
     cardboard slips in her hands.347     The Zombie has almost reached the middle landing.
348     Roger looks down through a ceiling grid. He sees the interior of
     a Sporting Goods Store. Along one wall is an arsenal of the
     latest weaponry for the sportsman.349     Roger:     SWEET JESUS!
     Peter:     I SEEN IT. COME ON!     The men are in a large ductwork which seems to run along the
     entire length of the mall. They move as quietly as they can.
     There are several side tunnels branching off in both directions.

350     Steve passes another ceiling grid and looks down. He sees a
     full equipped radio and electronics shop.

     Roger:     I HOPE YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOIN', BUDDY.

     Peter:     (who is leading)
               THIS IS IT. COME ON.

351     Fran struggles with the carton. She gets it against the door
     finally and moves to haul another.

352     The Zombie has reached the top landing and makes for the door.

353     Before the woman can bring another carton over, she sees the
     door move. She throws herself against it, but can't plant her
     feet well because of the carton of the floor. The door moves an
     inch at a time. The creature's hand reaches into the room. It
     clutches at the edge of the door.

354     Fran panics and runs back towards the escape pyramid, where she
     turns and faces the door.

355     The creature is straining against the weight of the carton. Now,
     now both its hands clutch the door edge. The carton moves
     another inch...and another. Now, the creature's head can be seen
     as it strains to get through the widening space.

356     Fran's eyes are wide, almost hypnotised. She looks for something
     to use as a weapon. The room is bare but for the cartons and
     water drums. She is about to opt for the skylight, when she
     glimpses Roger's knap-sack in the shadows. She runs for it as
     the creature finally breaks into the big room.

357     The woman's hands tremble as she rummages through the cloth
     sack. Nothing appropriate. She dumps the contents out:
     ammunition, mace cans, batteries, flares...flares! She
     nervously grabs one of the cylinders and her shaking hands try
     to deal with the paper wrapping.

358     The Zombie moans as it draws closer. It is approaching the
     pyramid of cartons.

359     Fran manages to free the wrapping, and snaps the cylinder in two
     at the mark.

360     Now the Zombie is between her and the pyramid, cutting off her
     immediate route. It is very near. Fran backs away a few steps as
     she tries to strike the flare head on the small striker on the
     cylinder cap. It doesn't fire...she tries again...and again.
     Now, the Zombie has reached the knap-sack. It kicks through the
     items and knocks and rolls the other flares.

     Fran's flare finally catches with a great whoosh, the bright
     flame startling the woman as well as the Zombie. The creature's
     eyes go wide and it brings its arms up to avoid the brightness.
     The intense white flame casts an eerie light over the creature
     and throws the Zombie's enormous shadow against the cartons and
     wall. The creature backs away a few steps almost tripping over
     the articles on the floor.

     Fran manages to advance close enough to snatch two extra
     cylinders and skirt around the Zombie in a wide arc. The
     creature swats the air, keeping distance, but threatening.

     Fran considers the firestair door, but decides on the pyramid.
     She circles around to a point where she can climb up from
     behind the moaning Zombie. She rushes for the cartons and
     climbs, but loses her footing while trying to hold the flares
     and crashes into the topmost carton. It starts to slide off
     the pyramid and tumbles to the floor almost crashing into the
     Zombie. The creature starts to clutch at the pyramid.

     The stack of cartons is now too short and Fran can reach the
     skylight but can't pull herself up. She accidentally drops
     two flares, including the lit one. It tumbles to the floor
     behind the pyramid where it no longer offends the Zombie's
     eye's. Now the creature tries to climb to the woman.

     Fran grabs the last flare in her mouth and reaches with both
     hands for the skylight. She lifts with all her might and her
     feet come off the cartons but she cannot pull herself up. As she
     tries to lower her feet back to the cartons, the pyramid shakes
     and wobbles from the Zombie. The creature is making progress;
     its hands can almost touch Fran's foot.

361     Peter drops out of a ceiling grid into a plush office. Roger's
     legs appear through the grid and he too swings down, holding on
     with his hands to soften his landing.

     Suddenly, we are aware of a third person on the room in the
     large chair at the desk. Roger startles and grabs his gun.
     Peter just stares. They are in the President's office. Some
     days earlier, the President, shot himself in the head.

     Peter:     COME ON...

     Steve struggles overhead.

     Peter:     JUST DROP, I GOT YOU...           

     Steve:     I CAN'T...I...

     Peter:     (to Roger)
               THE DESK...GIMME A HAND.

     The two Troopers grab the desk and slide it away from the
     President's corpse. The action causes the chair to spin slightly
     and his wide terrified eyes seem to watch the action.

     The desk in place. Steve's toes can reach its surface. He loses
     his balance slightly and pulls back up. He kicks a picture frame
     off the desk onto the floor, shattering the glass over photos of
     the President's wife and children.

     Peter:     COME ON!

     Steve finally gets footing on the desktop and lowers himself
     down. He stares at the corpse as Roger helps him off the desk.

362     Peter is already unlocking the door to the corridor. He opens it
     a crack and peeks out.

363     The corridor is empty. He sees the door at the end which leads
     to the exterior corridor.

364     As the other men come up behind, Peter opens the door quietly
     and slips into the hall. He starts to walk quickly toward the
     door to the exterior corridor. Roger follows as Stephen moves
     backwards toward the fire stairs.

365     Peter's hands grab the barrow and pulls the cart down the
     corridor backwards so as to face the mall opening.

366     In the corridor, Steve clutches the maintenance manual. Peter
     backs slowly up the hall. The wheels squeak and the big man
     bites his lip. Roger kicks the last corpse to the wall. Steve
     notices that the fire stairs door is open wide.

     Steve:     JESUS CHRIST!

     He bounds towards the door. Roger spins to see what happened.
     Peter turns and quickens his pace. Steve trots up the steps.

     Roger:     (to Peter)
               COME ON...YOU GOT IT.

     Peter runs with the cart the last few yards. As he gets to the
     doorway, Roger breaks up the steps.

368     Steve breaks into the storage area...he drops the manual...

     Steve:     FRANNIE!

369     The woman turns in Steve's direction. The Zombie swats the
     flare out of Fran's hand. She startles and the cartons feel as
     though they will topple. She steadies herself with both hands.
     The creature is grabbing at her legs. She kicks.

370     Steve raises his rifle and moves in for a close shot.

     Roger:     DON'T SHOOT...THEY'LL HEAR YA...

     Roger arrives and the two men charge the pyramid.

371     The creature is still clutching at Fran. She kicks violently as
     Roger pulls the back of the Zombie's clothing. The Zombie falls
     and hits the floor. As it kneels up, Steve swings the butt of
     his rifle and smashes it into the thing's head. Then Roger
     delivers a blow with his gun, straight down.

372     Steve rushes to Fran. She falls off the cartons into his arms
     sobbing and choking.

     Steve:     FRANNIE...ARE YOU ALRIGHT?
               YOU OK, FRANNIE? HEY...

     The woman is incoherent. She is clutching at her stomach.

373     Peter appears in the doorway carrying the TV and several other
     items. He dumps them on the floor.

     Peter:     LET'S GET THIS STUFF UP, COME ON.

374     Roger is dragging the dead Zombie to the door. Peter comes to
     help and Fran starts to wretch. Steve tries to calm her. He gets
     some water in a can and brings it over.

     Steve:     FRANNIE...IT'S OK...COME ON, IT'S OK...ARE YOU
               HURT, HUN? DID YA HURT YOURSELF? FRANNIE...

375     Downstairs, at the exterior corridor, Peter peeks out. He can
     see the mall at the far end. The coast is clear. He and Roger
     hurriedly carry the corpse into the hall and roll it onto the
     floor and retreat back into the fire stairs. Peter holds open
     the door slightly and watches the corridor for a moment.
     Convinced they've not been seen, he closes the door.

376     Peter:     I THINK WE'RE OK, BROTHER.

     They grab more supplies from the barrow and start upstairs.

377     Steve still tries to comfort Fran.

     Steve:     WE'RE OK...WE'RE ALL OK...WE GOT A LOT
               OF STUFF...ALL KINDS OF STUFF...

     In the background the two Troopers bring their load of supplies
     into the big room and deposit them near the TV. Then they go
     downstairs for another load.

     Steve:     THIS IS A TERRIFIC PLACE...FRANNIE. THIS PLACE
               IS PERFECT. WE GOT IT MADE IN HERE...FRANNIE.

     The woman still cannot stop sobbing and retching.

378     Now, the enormous barricade of food cartons is stacked against
     the door again. It is quiet except for the little noises of
     eating and occasional rustle of paper. We also head a faint
     electronic whistle, but we do not recognise it.

     As we see more of the room, we find our refugees sitting near
     the reconstructed pyramid on the floor. Peter seems to be asleep
     up against the pyramid. Roger is nibbling at delicacies from the
     Department Store's Gourmet department.

     Their "loot" is laid around them on the floor. Roger, as he
     eats, is leafing through the maintenance manual. There is a
     stack of tools, some still in wrapping; electric razors, still
     boxed; some clothing articles; the radio, which also plays small
     cassettes. There are soaps, toiletries, pens, pencils, and
     notebooks, flashlights, cigarettes and several decks of cards
     with a canister of chips. The items are clearly not all
     functional. Some are representative of the luxuries considered
     necessary by a consumer society.

     They are all bathed in the blue glow from the television which
     Stephen tries to tune in. Its power cable is spliced into the
     leads of a bare light fixture overhead. Fran cannot be seen at
     first.

     Roger:     WHAT THE HELL TIME IS IT, ANYWAY?

     Steve:     ONLY ABOUT NINE.

     Roger:     AND NOTHING? (referring to the TV)

     On the screen we see the Civil Defence logo, and realise that
     the high pitched electronic signal is coming from the TV set.

     Steve:     AS LONG AS WE'RE GETTING THE PATTERN,
               THAT MEANS THEY'RE SENDING.

     Roger snaps on the large, battery powered radio. He rolls the
     dial getting nothing but static. Finally, he hears a signal
     and tunes it in. A badly modulated voice is droning through
     the interference. It sounds like a war correspondent sending
     a signal from very far away.

     Radio:     ...REPORTS THAT COMMUNICATIONS WITH DETROIT
               HAVE BEEN KNOCKED OUT ALONG WITH ATLANTA,
               BOSTON AND CERTAIN SECTIONS OF PHILADELPHIA
               AND NEW YORK CITY...

     Roger:     PHILLY...

     Steve:     I KNOW J.A.S IS OUT BY NOW...IT WAS A MADHOUSE
               BACK THERE...PEOPLE ARE CRAZY...IF THEY'D JUST
               ORGANISE...IT'S TOTAL CONFUSION...I DON'T
               BELIEVE IT'S GOTTEN THIS BAD. I DON'T BELIEVE
               THEY CAN'T HANDLE IT. LOOK AT US. LOOT AT
               WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO TODAY.

379     Peter's eyes suddenly blink open. None of the rest of his body
     moves, the others do not realise he is awake. The big man stares
     at Stephen, who is getting emotionally excited about their
     exploits as a team.

     Steve:     WE KNOCKED THE SHIT OUT OF 'EM AND THEY
               NEVER TOUCHED US...NOT REALLY.

     Peter:     THEY TOUCHED US GOOD, FLYBOY. WE'RE LUCKY
               TO GET OUT WITH OUR ASSES. YOU DON'T FORGET THAT!

380     The other men look at Peter. The radio drones on with more
     disaster reports.

     Peter:      YOU GET OVERCONFIDENT...UNDERESTIMATE THOSE
              SUCKERS...AND YOU GET EATEN! HOW YOU LIKE THAT?

     Peter speaks in a low, unemotional tone. Stephen is transfixed.

     Peter:      THEY GOT A BIG ADVANTAGE OVER US BROTHER.
              THEY DON'T THINK. THEY JUST BLIND-ASS DO WHAT
              THEY GOT TO DO. NO EMOTIONS. AND THAT BUNCH
              OUT THERE? THAT'S JUST A HANDFUL AND EVERY
              DAY THERE'LL BE MORE.
              A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE DIE EACH DAY
              FROM NATURAL CAUSES. THAT PROB'LY TRIPLES OR
              BETTER WITH FOLK KNOCKIN' EACH OTHER OFF THE
              WAY IT'S GOIN'.
              NOW SAY EACH ONE OF THEM COMES BACK AND KILLS
              TWO, AND EACH ONE OF THEM TWO MORE...
              YOU KNOW ABOUT THE EMPEROR'S REWARD?      

381     We see Fran's face. She is listening. There is no answer
     audible. A tear rolls down the woman's cheek. The radio drones.

     After a time, Steve appears. He is surprised to find the woman
     awake. She sits on a new blanket from the store. Another is
     rolled up as a pillow. She wipes away her tears with her
     cigarette still in her hand.

     Steve:     HEY...YOU OK?

     The man kneels next to her, not knowing what to say. Stephen
     sits down next to her and puts his hands on her shoulders.

     Fran:     SO I GUESS WE FORGET ABOUT CANADA, RIGHT?

     Steve:     (taking her in his arms)
               JESUS, FRANNIE, THIS SET UP IS SENSATIONAL.
               WE GOT EVERYTHING WE NEED. WE SEAL OFF THAT
               STAIRWAY...NOBODY'LL EVER KNOW WE'RE UP HERE.
               WE'D NEVER FIND ANYTHING LIKE THIS...

     Fran:     I GUESS NOBODY CARES ABOUT MY VOTE, HUH?

     Steve:     COME ON, FRANNIE, YOU WERE SLEEPING.

     Fran:     WHAT HAPPENED TO GROWING VEGETABLES AND FISHING?
               WHAT HAPPENED TO THE IDEA ABOUT THE WILDERNESS...
               HUNDREDS OF MILES FROM ANYTHING AND ANYBODY...
               STEVE, I'M AFRAID. YOU'RE HYPNOTISED BY THIS
               PLACE. ALL OF YOU. IT'S ALL SO BRIGHT AND NEATLY
               WRAPPED THAT YOU DON'T SEE...YOU DON'T SEE THAT IT
               CAN BE A PRISON.

     She leans in to him, making a final plea.

     Fran:     STEPHEN, LET'S JUST TAKE WHAT WE NEED AND KEEP
               GOING.

     Steve:     WE CAN'T HARDLY CARRY ANYTHING IN THAT LITTLE BIRD.

     Fran:     (angry)
               WHAY DO YOU WANT? A NEW SET OF FURNITURE? A
               FREEZER? A CONSOLE TV AND A STEREO? WE CAN TAKE
               WHAT WE NEED. WHAT WE NEED TO SURVIVE.

382     Cut to a close up of Peter's face. His eyes pop open.

     Peter:     SHUT THAT THING OFF!

     Roger clicks off the radio. They listen. They hear slight sounds
     coming from the fire stairs. The end of the room with the
     barricade of cartons looks surreal in the blue glow of the TV
     screen which still shines.

     Roger crawls over and clicks the TV off as well. The electronic
     whistle slowly dies. Silence.

     Steve steps out from behind the wall of cartons. Fran peers
     around the corner to look, but she still sits on the floor.
     Another noise. The faint squeaking of the door to the bottom of
     the steps. Then footsteps on the metal stairs. Slow...
     lumbering.

     The faces of the humans all tighten. Peter and Roger pull their
     rifles. Roger makes his ready.

     Some thumping in the hall. Steve squats down and holds Fran.
     The sounds are closer now. The door behind the cartons clicks
     but does not move. More pounding...then silence.

     After a time, the footsteps recede down the stairs.

     Peter:     SOMEBODY BETTER SIT WATCH ALL THE TIME.

     Roger:     THEY'LL NEVER GET THROUGH THERE.

     Peter:     ENOUGH OF 'EM WILL. AND IT AIN'T JUST THEM THINGS
               WE GOT TO WORRY ABOUT. THAT CHOPPER UP THERE COULD
               GIVE US AWAY IF SOMEBODY COMES MESS' AROUND.

     Roger:     WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO? LAND ANOTHER PILOT TO FLY
               IT OUT. THEY'RE NOT GONNA MESS WITH A LITTLE BIRD
               LIKE THAT. THEY GOT ENOUGH ON THEIR HANDS. YOU
               KNOW BACK IN PHILLY WE FOUND A BOAT IN THE MIDDLE
               OF INDEPENDENCE SQUARE. SOMEBODY TRYIN' TO CARRY
               IT TO THE RIVER, I GUESS. DIDN'T MAKE IT. DAMN
               THING SAT THERE FOR EIGHT DAYS.

     Peter:     SOMEBODY FINALLY GOT IT, THOUGH. IT COMES DOWN TO
               HOW MUCH ITS WORTH.

383     Fran ducks back onto her blanket. She disgustedly lights another
     cigarette. Steve sits next to her again.

     Steve:     FRANNIE...

     She doesn't respond.

     Steve:     DAMMIT, FRAN, YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES WE'D
               HAVE TO LAND FOR FUEL TRYIN' TO MAKE IT UP NORTH?
               THOSE THINGS ARE OUT THERE EVERYWHERE. AND THE
               AUTHORITIES WOULD GIVE US JUST AS HARD A TIME...
               MAYBE WORSE... WE'RE IN GOOD SHAPE HERE, FRANNIE.
               WE GOT EVERYTHING WE NEED RIGHT HERE!

     Stephen curls up with his head on the rolled blanket.

     Steve:     COME ON...GET SOME SLEEP.

     The woman doesn't move.

     Steve:     FRANNIE. COME ON.

     She grinds her cigarette out on the concrete floor and stretches
     out next to the man. He puts his arm around her. His hands rub
     up and down her body as he curls next to her. He opens her
     blouse and reaches inside. He closes his eyes and he seems
     perfectly comfortable to rest in her softness. His hand moves
     under her clothing. She doesn't respond, at first, then her body
     relaxes somewhat and she brings one of her arms up around his
     head.

     Steve:     I'M NOT JUST BEING STUBBORN. I REALLY THINK THIS
               IS BETTER. HELL. YOU'RE THE ONE'S BEEN WANTIN' TO
               SET UP HOUSE.

     She stares off across the barren room. His hands continues to
     move under her blouse.

384     In the Administration Corridor, a few stray Zombies wander among
     the corpses on the floor. One large and severely wounded
     creature pounds on the door to the interior corridor. It had
     been the one which was pounding at the door upstairs.

     A female Zombie squats near one of the corpses in the hall. She
     lifts its arm and moves it to her mouth, but she drops it
     quickly, repelled by its coldness. She leans over and picks at
     another corpse, then she stands and drifts towards the mall.

     Slowly the creatures leaves the corridor and move out onto the
     second floor balcony. We begin to hear a voice fading in over
     the scene.

     Voice:     ...NOT ACTUALLY CANNIBALISM...CANNIBALISM IN THE
               TRUE SENSE OF THE WORD, IMPLIES AN INTRASPECIE
               ACTIVITY... THESE CREATURES CANNOT BE CONSIDERED
               HUMAN..THEY PREY ON HUMANS...THEY DO NOT PREY ON
               EACH OTHER.

385     We see the mall balcony now. Zombies wander past the stores.
     Some move down the stationary stairs onto the main concourse.
     Below.

     Voice:     THEY ATTACK AND...AND FEED...ONLY ON WARM HUMAN
               FLESH...

386     At the mall entrances, some creatures drift out into the night.
     Others still enter the enormous building. There are not as many
     as there were in the afternoon, but there are certainly enough
     to be threatening.

     Voice:     INTELLIGENCE? SEEMINGLY LITTLE OR NO REASONING
               POWER. WHAT BASIC SKILLS REMAIN ARE MORE
               REMEMBERED BEHAVIOURS FROM...FROM NORMAL LIFE.

387     Several creatures are clawing at the roll gate to the department
     store. It is a strange and eerie sight. The staring, painted
     eyes of the mannequins within the store seem to watch the
     Zombies. The gate rattles but does not budge.

     Voice:     THERE ARE REPORTS OF THE CREATURES USING TOOLS,
               BUT EVEN THESE ACTIONS ARE THE MOST PRIMITIVE...
               THE USE OF EXTERNAL ARTICLES AS BLUDGEONS ETC.,
               EVEN ANIMALS WILL ADOPT THE BASIC USE OF TOOLS IN
               THIS MANNER.

388     Fran's eyes pop open the voice has awakened her. She has been
     asleep on the blanket.

     Voice:     THESE CREATURES ARE NOTHING BUT PURE, MOTORISED
               INSTINCT...

     The woman looks around. Morning sunlight is spilling in through
     the skylights above. She sits up and peers into the next area of
     the room. The men are gone. The television is playing. On the
     tube we see a dishevelled man sitting in an emergency news room
     reading the report.

389     Voice:     THEIR ONLY DRIVE IS FOR THE FOOD WHICH SUSTAINS
               THEM. WE MUST NOT BE LULLED BY THE CONCEPT
               THAT THESE ARE OUR FAMILY MEMBERS OR OUR FRIENDS.
               THEY WILL NOT RESPOND TO SUCH EMOTIONS. THEY
               MUST BE DESTROYED ON SIGHT....

390     Fran sees that the barricade of cartons is still in place at
     the fire stairs door. She looks up. The skylight above the
     pyramid is open. She realises that the men are on the roof.

391     At the edge of the roof, Peter looks through binoculars.

392     About a quarter of a mile away, he sees the large warehouse of
     a food processing chain. IN the yard and in the large open
     garages of the building, he sees a fleet on enormous trailer-
     trucks parked.

393     Steve:     YOU SURE WE CAN START 'EM.

     Roger:     YOU HAVEN'T SPENT ENOUGH TIME ON THE STREET.

     Peter:     WELL LET'S GET IT UP. THERE'S NOT TOO MANY
               OF 'EM AROUND YET THIS MORNIN'.

     The big trooper looks down to the parking lot below.

394     There are not as many Zombies as there were the day before, and
     they wander aimlessly, spread out rather than in clusters.

395     The men move for the skylight.

396     In the storage area below, Fran is examining the maps in the
     manual. The TV still drones in a low volume. The men climb
     down into the room.

     Roger:     HEY, FRAN...

     Fran:     I WOULD HAVE MADE COFFEE AND BREAKFAST, BUT I
               DON'T HAVE MY POTS AND PANS.

     There is a bitterness in her voice. Roger laughs. Steve senses
     the tension. Peter just straps on his equipment.

     Fran:     CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

     Steve:     SURE. WHAT DP YOU MEAN?

     Fran:     I'M SORRY YOU FOUND OUT I'M PREGNANT, BECAUSE I
               DON'T WANT ANY OF YOU TO TREAT ME DIFFERENTLY
               THAN YOU'D TREAT ANOTHER GUY.

     Steve:     HEY, FRANNIE, COME ON...

     Fran:     AND,...I'M NOT GONNA BE DEN MOTHER FOR YOU GUYS.

     They all look at her, attentive now.

     Fran:     AND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. AND I
               WANT SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE PLANS. THERE'S
               FOUR OF US, OK?

     Steve:     JESUS, FRAN...

     Peter:     FAIR ENOUGH!

     Fran:     NOW. WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

     Peter:     WE'RE GOIN' OUT.

     Fran starts to say something, but this time Peter cuts her off.

     Peter:     ...AND YOU ARE NOT COMING WITH US!

     Again the woman starts to protest, but Peter continues.

     Peter:     AND YOU WILL NOT COME WITH US UNTIL YOU CAN
               HANDLE YOURSELF. THAT MEANS LEARN TO SHOOT AND
               LEARN TO FIGHT.

     The big man starts back up the pyramid. Roger moves to
     follow him.

     Fran:     SOMETHING ELSE.

     The men look at her. She faces Roger and Peter directly without
     looking at Stephen.

     Fran:     I DON'T KNOW ANOUT YOU TWO, BUT I WANNA LEARN
               HOW TO FLY THAT HELICOPTER.

     Stephen is shocked. Fran looks at him and lowers her eyes.

     Fran:     IF ANYTHING HAPPENS...WE'VE GOTTA BE ABLE TO GET
               OUT OF HERE.

     Stephen doesn't know what to say. He looks at the woman,
     then up at the other men.

     Peter:     SHE'S RIGHT, FLYBOY. COME ON, LET'S GO.

     Fran:     AND YOU'RE NOT LEAVING ME WITHOUT A GUN AGAIN.

     Stephen thinks about protesting but he complies by slowly
     setting his rifle down on the cartons. Then he fishes in his
     pocket for a fistful of shells and dumps them next to the gun.
     He stares at the woman angry and hurt.

     Fran picks up the weapon and shoots a glance up at Peter. 
               
     Fran:     I JUST MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE
               IT.

     Peter and Roger disappear through the skylight. Stephen stands
     still. He looks down at the floor. Fran moves close to his side.

     Fran:     I'M SORRY, STEPHEN. (it is not an apology)

     Steve:     I KNOW...I KNOW...IT'S ALRIGHT!

     He starts up to the skylight.

     Fran:     STEPHEN

     Steve:     YEAH.

     He stops and turns to look at her. Her eyes are pleading for
     understanding, but he is incapable of it at the moment. Fran
     just shrugs off whatever she was going to say, and she sighs
     with exasperation.

     Fran:     BE CAREFUL.

     Steve:     YEAH, WE'LL BE ALRIGHT.

     He disappears through the skylight. Fran stares down at the
     weapon in her hands, then she steps over and clicks off the
     television.

397     The sudden, loud noise of the chopper engine as it hovers.
     Only Stephen is on board at the controls.

398     In the cab of one of the big trailer trucks Roger is crouching
     working on the wiring beneath the dashboard.

399     Peter sits on the cab of another truck. He tries the
     complicated shift mechanism and fidgets with the other controls.
     Then he pulls out. He stops the big vehicle with his cab just
     abreast of the cab Roger is working in.

     Peter:     HOW ABOUT IT?

     Roger:     GETTIN' IT.

400     Peter looks around. The mall can be seen in the distance. On the
     ground between, there are a few Zombies scattered about in
     little clusters. None of them present any immanent danger.

401     Roger sits up and is able to start his truck.

     Peter:     I'LL JUST RIDE PICK UP, I'M NOT TOO SURE OF
               THIS THING...

     Roger:     I GREW UP ON ONE OF THESE, LET'S GO.

402     The great trucks lumber away from the warehouse. They pull
     across the little loading lot and out a ramp toward the
     roadway. Stephen hovers overhead in the chopper, following
     the trucks as closely as he can.

403     On the roof of the mall, Fran clutches her rifle. She sees the
     big trucks roar up over the hill, the helicopter just above
     them. It is a strange looking convoy as it speeds toward the
     trucks as closely as it can.

404     Along the road, several Zombies try to stagger after the trucks
     but they are left in the dust of the speeding vehicles. The
     creatures lumber along slowly behind.

405     The vehicles pull into the little grade which loads into the
     mall's parking lot. They roar right toward the building.

406     At one of the building entrances, a cluster of Zombies is
     moving in and lot of the main doors. Others wander nearby in the
     parking lot. Attracted by the sounds of the engines, the
     creatures turn and face the trucks.

     As Peter pulls his vehicle in a wide arc, Roger drives his right
     up to the side of the building and roars toward the entrance
     doors. Then he skips his right wheels up onto the curb, and with
     a great, scraping crunch, the big truck pulls directly abreast
     of the building, flush with the entrance. The huge vehicle
     crushes several of the helpless creatures and knocks other
     flying back.

407     The trailer of the truck has totally blocked off the mall
     entrance. Several Zombies trapped inside try to push the glass
     doors open. The doors move, but cannot be opened wide enough
     for the creatures to get out.

408     The few creatures immediately around the truck begin clambering
     at its sides. Roger shuts off the engine and grabs his gun as
     other Zombies begin clutching at the windows of the cab.

409     Overhead, the whirlybird hovers very close by. Now Peter's big
     truck pulls up alongside so that Peter's passenger door is
     directly abreast of the free door on Roger's cab.

     Peter's truck also crushes one or two of the creatures, but
     there are still several in the immediate vicinity of the cab.

410     As Roger opens his door and scrambles into the other truck, one
     of the Zombies grabs hold. Roger just manages to kick the
     creature off as the big truck pulls out and roars across the
     lot.

411     The helicopter flies straight up and directly over the roof of
     the big shopping centre, where Fran has been watching the
     action. She now runs to the other side of the roof, the wind
     from the chopper whipping her hair.

412     The chopper turns and waits for the big truck to move up under
     it, then the whirlybird escorts the trailer back to the warehouse
     down the road.

413     Roger is whooping and hollering like a cowboy as the big rig
     pulls up beside another of the parked vans.

     Peter:     COME ON, COME ON... THREE MORE BABY.

     Roger:     LIKE A CHARM, HUH? LIKE A FUCKING CHARM!

     Roger grabs his knapsack and climbs into the new cab where he
     immediately goes to work on jumping the engine cables.

414     From the helicopter overhead, Stephen spots something moving
     around the warehouse. He jockeys the chopper slightly for a
     better look and he sees a small group of Zombies wandering out
     of the big garage directly toward Roger's truck.

415     In the meantime, Peter's truck pulls away from the cab Roger is
     in. The big vehicle rolls into the large paved area behind the
     warehouse where Peter can turn it around easily.

416     Stephen swoops down with the big bird. He buzzes as close as he
     can to Roger's truck, trying to signal the man.

417     Roger continues to work on the cables, still whooping like a
     child. The Zombies are very close at hand. They have just
     about reached the cab. Stephen buzzes again. Roger doesn't
     notice.

418     Peter has now backed up into a position which enables him to
     pull out. He looks up to see the helicopter heading straight
     for him.

419     The big chopper buzzes right over Peter's cab then spins around
     heading back for Roger.

420     Peter looks toward the other truck. He can now see the lumbering
     creatures. He tries to slam the truck into gear, but the
     complicated shift mechanism fights him.

421     One Zombie slams its hands against the driver-side window of
     Roger's truck. The man startles and tries to untangle himself
     from his cramped position under the big steering wheel. He is
     stuck for a moment. The other creatures appear at the passenger
     side of the cab, where the door is open. One grabs at Roger's
     legs. Roger kicks violently, but can't get a good position. He
     falls lower onto the floor of the cab, his body almost knotted
     among the controls and the shift sticks.

422     Peter's truck starts to roll, but it accelerates slowly.

423     The helicopter tries to buzz the clutching ghouls, but they do
     not even flinch. The wind from the propeller blades whip at the
     creatures' hair, making them look even more frightening as they
     claw at the desperate Roger.

424     The man kicks and kicks, but he cannot deliver a solid blow from
     his pinned position. His hand gropes on the seat of the truck
     for his rifle, which suddenly fires as the man's fingers
     inadvertently hit the trigger. A shell blasts through the chest
     of the lead creature, but the thing pays little attention.

425     Peter's truck is starting to roll faster. He heads right for
     Roger's cab.

426     The helicopter hovers as Stephen tries to see the action.

427     Now Roger has a good grip on his gun, but he cannot clear the
     long weapon from around the gear sticks. The lead Zombie is
     actually scrambling into the cab and is all but on top of the
     struggling Trooper.

428     The second creature is about to claw its way in when, with a
     great roar, Peter's truck swings up and crushes it.

429     Roger is desperately trying to keep the other Zombie's mouth
     away. They are wrestling now. The Zombie is weak, as usual, but
     Roger is still hampered by the position he is in.

430     Peter has pulled too far past the other truck. He slams his rig
     into reverse and backs up. Now his window is in a direct line
     with the open door on Roger's cab. He raises his rifle and aims,
     but he cannot get a clear shot. He shouts loudly trying to
     overcome the noise of the truck engine and the hovering
     helicopter.

     Peter:     GET ITS HEAD UP...GET ITS HEAD UP...

431     Roger realises that Peter is outside. He struggles with the
     creature, dropping his gun. His hands manage to get a
     stranglehold on the creature's neck. He pushes up with all his
     might. The Zombie's hands are clutching at the man's face. It's
     fingers push at the man's eyes.

432     Peter sees the opportunity and fires. The gun roars loudly.

433     The Zombie's head flies apart. Remnants of blood and brain
     tissue splatter the inside of the cab and the driver's window.
     The gummy stuff flies into Roger's face. The Zombie falls limp,
     but Roger is still desperate. The dead weight of the creature is
     now on top of him, and the bloody wound runs. Roger is frantic.
     He frees himself with great heaves of his body and he pushes the
     creature out of the cab. The man's eyes are wide with revulsion.
     He instantly brings up his sleeve to wipe the stains from his
     face. He is quivering in extremes of emotions.

     A sudden crash. Roger spins. The Zombie at the driver door has
     smashed through the cab window with a brick. Roger, still
     shaking, dives down to the floor for his weapon.

434     Peter tries to level off a shot but he cannot because Roger is
     in the way...

     Peter:     GET DOWN...STAY DOWN...I GOT IT!

435     Roger, in his adrenalised anger, sits up with his gun and levels
     off on the creature himself. He fires. The shell crashes through
     the already shattered glass and squarely into the creatures
     head.

     Roger:     YOU BASTARDS...YOU BASTARDS...     

     It seems as though his mind is snapping. His voice quivers as
     does his body.

     Roger:     WE GOT 'EM, BUDDY...WE GOT 'EM DIDN'T WE!

436     Peter:     COOL IT, MAN...GET YOUR HEAD...

437     Roger:     WE GOT THIS BY THE ASS...GOT THIS BY THE ASS!

     Roger is screaming. He dives down to work on the jumping again.

438     Peter:     HEY, ROG...GET YOUR HEAD MAN...COME ON...
               WE GOT A LOT TO DO...ROGER...

439     There is no response from the other truck. Peter is about to
     open his door and step out when suddenly Roger sits up again.
     The engine of the truck roars. He seems to have calmed down
     some. He looks across at Peter.

     Roger:     LET'S GO BABY...NUMBER TWO...

     Peter:     YOU ALRIGHT?

     Roger:     PERFECT, BABY...PERFECT!

     Roger guns the engine on his truck. The big vehicle lumbers out
     of the area. Peter follows suit.

440     The two Semis rumble out of the warehouse lot and start down the
     grade toward the road. The helicopter escorts them.

441     A few Zombies are walking up the road slowly.

442     Roger's eyes get wider with anger. He steers his big rig right
     for the creatures.

443     The front of the cab smashes into two of them. One is crushed
     under the wheels, the other flies back from the impact.

444     Fran watches with anxiety. She sees the two trucks pull up over
     the rise with the helicopter following. We hear spirited music
     as the convoy approaches the mall building.

445     The two trucks roar around the entrance ramps into the parking
     lot and again, the chopper zooms right over the roof.

446     Fran trots across the roof to see the action in the lot.

447     the trucks rumble toward the second set of doors. The music
     continues through the entire action.

448     Roger steers his giant vehicle directly broadside to the doors.
     The cab knocks over several creatures and scrapes the building
     as the trailer blocks off the entrance. This time there are
     still creatures alive in the immediate area. They clutch at the
     cab of the truck and leap at the doors.

449     Fran, watching from directly above, seems inspired, caught up in
     the bravery of the moment. As she sees the creatures converging
     on the truck, she aims her rifle at them. Before she fires,
     Peter's rig slides next to Roger's, cabs abreast.

450     Peter's truck knocks over several of the clutching creatures.
     One Zombie, caught directly under the front wheels, is still
     alive and clutching at the air. Several creatures jump at
     Peter's driver side window.

451     Roger, grabbing his gun, moves to leave his truck on Peter's
     side, but the trucks are too close. His door won't open
     enough to get out. He rolls down his window. Peter has noticed
     Roger's door won't open, and the Trooper fumbles with the gear
     shift in order to pull away, but he hears Roger shouting:

     Roger:     THE WINDOWS...OPEN YOUR WINDOW...YOUR WINDOW...

     Peter dives across the cab and rolls down the passenger window.
     Roger leans out his open window, trying to get his weapon into
     firing position. One or two Zombies are squeezing through the
     narrow space between the truck. They are just about to reach
     Roger when he fires, killing the lead ghoul. More Zombies move
     around Roger's cab, moments away from him.

452     The helicopter buzzes the area as Stephen watches the Zombies
     converge on the cab.

453     Fran, her hair blowing front he chopper, tries to aim her rifle
     into the pack of creatures. Her hair covers her eyes and she
     brushes it away with irritation.

     Fran:     ROGER...IN FRONT, ROGER...IN FRONT, ROGER...

     She shouts over the engine noises, getting very excited.

454     Roger fires again and again down the narrow space between the
     rigs. Another Zombie falls.

     Peter:     FOR CHRISSAKE COME ON!

     Roger is still emotionally crazed. He leans out of his window in
     a very vulnerable position. He is whooping like a child again as
     he tries to level off another shot.

     Suddenly, he's grabbed from behind by a Zombie and almost falls
     out the window. He struggles to hold himself and keep a grip on
     his gun. Peter leans over, trying to get a shot at the creature,
     but can't get a clean sight. Roger grabs the window frames on
     Peter's door and tries to pull himself up. Another creature
     grabs him from behind.

455     Fran watches with emotion in her eyes.

     Fran:     MONSTERS! MONSTERS!

     She fires her gun.

456     The bullet slams into the pavement kicking up a cloud of smoke.
     It narrowly misses a creature. Fran fires again. Her shot tears
     into the shoulder of the Zombie, but it doesn't stop him.

457     The chopper zooms very close. Peter still cannot aim his rifle,
     but Roger, using both hands, brings his gun butt in an uppercut.
     It slams against a creature which is grabbing him and drives the
     thing staggering back. Then with a desperate driving motion, 
     Roger climbs through the window of Peter's cab.

458     Peter pulls the big rig away even while Roger's legs still kick
     out the window. The Zombies grab at Roger's ankles, and one
     manages to hold on as the truck starts to move.

459     Fran fires again and again.

460     This shot rips into the Zombie holding Roger's leg. It lets go
     and falls, rolling across the pavement. The woman fires again,
     hitting the pavement. The creature struggles to its knees. She
     fires again and hits the creature's neck. Again.
     Shoulder. Again...head. The Zombie sprawls on the pavement. Fran
     is exultant, she aims and fires at another creature.

461     The helicopter passes overhead. The music is still stirring.

462     In Peter's truck, just rolling out the lot, Roger realises:

     Roger:     JESUS!

     Peter:     WHAT?

     Roger:     MY GODDAM BAG...I LEFT MY GODDAM BAG IN THE
               OTHER TRUCK.

     Peter brings his vehicle to a screeching halt.

     Peter:     ALRIGHT, NOW YOU SON OF A BITCH! YOU
               BETTER SCREW YOUR FUCKIN' HEAD ON, BABY!

     Roger:     YEAH, YEAH...I'M O.K. LET'S GO.

     Suddenly, Peter grabs the Trooper by his lapels and slams
     him back against the door of the cab.

     Peter:     I MEAN IT! NOW YOU'RE NOT JUST PLAYIN' WITH
               YOUR LIFE, YOUR PLAYIN' WITH MINE!

     The two men stare at each other for a moment. Roger is startled
     somewhat out of his emotional rush.

     Peter:     (softer)
               ALRIGHT, NOW ARE YOU STRAIGHT?

     Roger:     YEAH.

     Peter lets him go and returns to the wheel. He guns the engine
     and roars into a big arcing turn in the parking lot.

463     When Fran sees the truck returning, she looks up from her gun
     sight. The helicopter has already flown over the roof, and
     Stephen is confused as to why the truck hadn't appeared on the
     road. Fran turns and tries to signal to Stephen.

464     He finally sees her and flies closer. The woman waves a signal
     and the chopper buzzes back over the lot.

465     Her hair blowing wildly, Fran takes up her post again, her rifle
     ready. She thinks a moment, then begins to reload the weapon
     pulling the shells from her blouse pocket.

466     Peter's truck zooms back into position, colliding with some of
     Zombies in the vicinity.

467     Roger immediately climbs through the windows into the original
     cab. He snatches up his knapsack and several tools which are
     strewn over the seat and floor.

     Again, creatures converge on the cab area. Two more come up
     between the trucks, several come around the front of the cab.

468     Fran is still loading.

469     The helicopter buzzes.

470     As Roger climbs back through the window, his pack accidentally
     falls to the ground. With reflex action, he drops between the
     cabs, landing on his feet. He is facing the two creatures
     which are very close. He reaches up and with on hand on each of
     the open window frames, he swings his legs up hard. His kick
     sends the creatures sprawling. Then, he bends to collect his
     pack and is grabbed from behind.

471     Peter tries to level off his gun but he cannot get a shot.

472     Neither can Fran who is shouting from the roof.

473     Roger keeps his head this time. His first thought is for the
     pack of tools. He tosses the sack into the cab of Peter's truck
     as though he were making a hook shot with a basketball.

474     Peter catches the pack as several of the tools clatter out and
     onto the floor of the cab.

475     The creature which has a hold on Roger takes advantage of the
     man's imbalance from throwing the knapsack. It bites at the
     man's arm. Roger tears away, but blood appears at the wound.
     Then Roger squares off a solid punch right to the Zombie's jaw.
     The creature flies back and almost knocks over the Zombies
     behind it. Roger jumps, making a grab for the window of Peter's
     cab. The Zombies between the trucks, which Roger originally
     kicked away, have regrouped. They advance and grab at the
     struggling trooper. Roger's feet try to get hold on the side of
     the door, but they slip.

476     Peter moves to drop his rifle and grab Roger's hands, but Roger
     falls from the high window back to the pavement. Peter draws his
     hand gun.

477     Roger leaps again, his hands catching the window frame. The
     Zombies are clutching at him. Again he swings up his legs and
     kicks the creatures off balance. This time he manages to get his
     feet locked against the door and Peter grabs the Troopers arm
     with his free hand, but another Zombie is pulling at the man's
     shirt and still another makes a grab for his legs.

     Peter reaches out with his pistol and fires a point blank shot
     at one of the clutching ghouls. It flies back and Roger is able
     to pull himself higher. His torso is just about through the
     window when another creature grabs him.

478     Peter can no longer get a shot as Roger fills the window, so the
     big man drops his pistol and pulls Roger's arm with all his
     might.
     
479     Roger is almost all the way in but his legs still dangle,
     kicking. Peter starts the truck. As it begins to roll away, one
     of the clutching Zombies is able to get a solid hold on Roger's
     left leg. The creature opens its mouth and bites at the calf.
     Blood appears. The creature bites again and this time it comes
     away with bits of flesh tangled in a bloodstained strip op
     material from Roger's trousers.

480     Roger screams in pain and kicks violently. The truck
     accelerates and the Zombie finally falls clear.

481     It rolls on the pavement for a little way before it stops.
     Then it sits on the ground, looking like a gorilla. It still
     has a bloody mass of flesh and material in its mouth. With its
     hands it tries to separate the cloth from the more important
     morsels.

     A bullet pings into the cement near the chewing Zombie. Another
     tears through its shoulder. It still is concerned only with its
     prize.

482     Fran is firing, swearing through her teeth as the gun roars.
     She finally hits the seated creature squarely in the head.

483     We see it fall from her point of view on the roof. Others walk
     by the corpse without taking notice.

484     The helicopter escorts the big truck back to the warehouse.

485     As it rumbles along, Roger, in extreme pain, is tying his belt
     tightly around his leg as a tourniquet. He sucks air through his
     teeth in anguish.

     Peter:     THAT'S IT.

     Roger:     BULL SHIT.

     Peter:     WE GOTTA DEAL WITH THAT LEG!

     Roger:     I'M DEALIN' WITH IT...I'M DEALIN' WITH IT FINE!
               I WON'T BE ABLE TO WALK ON THIS AT ALL IF WE WAIT.

     Peter:     CAN YOU WALK ON IT NOW?

     Roger:     YOUR DAMN RIGHT, I CAN...DAMN RIGHT, I CAN!

     The wounded trooper struggles to wrap the bloody part of his leg
     with a torn off piece of trouser. He can hardly keep from
     screaming, and his words come out sharply and with great breaths
     between them.
 
     Roger:     I STOP MOVIN' THIS LEG...MAY NOT EVER GET IT GOIN'
               AGAIN...THERE'S A LOT TO GET DONE BEFORE...BEFORE
               YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE ME...

     The big Black man stares at his friend for a moment. Then he
     drives on to the warehouse escorted by the chopper.

486     There is now a huge trailer truck at each of the four main
     entrances to the mall. They are very close to the doors, if not
     completely flush. Some of the glass portals can be opened not
     slightly, but not enough for the Zombies inside to pass through.

487     In the parking lot, the creatures mob around the trucks,
     frustrated that they cannot pass into the building. They clutch
     and claw at the enormous vehicles but to no avail. Some try to
     climb up onto the cabs. Others try to claw at the doors on the
     trailers.

488     Some creatures are crawling under the rigs: When they reach the
     mall doors they cannot stand, so they have no leverage. The
     creatures inside are pushing the doors out, so the Zombies under
     the trucks cannot push them in. The doors swing both in and out,
     so it is very clear that some access could be had by the
     creatures if they were more organised.

     One creature, having crawled under a trailer, does manage to
     push open a mall door. The thing crawls into the building
     through the legs of other ghouls which are trying to exit. They
     behave as a swarm of insects.

     The revolving door offers the best access for the creatures,
     although its inherent complexity is baffling to their empty
     brains. Two creatures do manage to crawl under the truck which
     blocks the revolving door, and one of them negotiates the
     rotating action and enters the concourse.

489     Peter and Stephen are huddled over the maps of the building.
     They are back in the crawl space. The cartons are still piled
     against the firestair entrance.

     Peter:     IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW MANY OF THEM ARE STILL
               INSIDE. THAT'S A LONG HAUL BETWEEN THOSE ENTRANCES.

     Steve:     WELL IF WE CAN GET SOME MORE FLARES...OR MAYBE
               SOME OF THOSE PROPANE JOBS.

     Peter:     THE GUNS ARE FIRST. GUNS AND AMMUNITION.

490     Roger moans with pain. Nearby, Fran is applying a dressing to
     his leg. The wound is wrapped with several layers of cloth. The
     first aid kit is open on the floor. Peter crouches near his
     friend. He takes over from Fran. He ties more strips tightly
     around the wound and around the upper thigh.

     Peter:     YOU SURE YOU GONNA MAKE IT, BUDDY?

     Roger:     JUST HURRY UP WITH THAT!

491     Again, the military music. A tall figure drops out of a ceiling
     grid and lands on the floor of the Sporting Goods Store. It is
     Peter. His rifle is slung and there is an empty pack on his
     back. Several of the Maintenance Room key rings are strapped
     into his belt.

492     Suddenly a Zombie charges across the room. The gate to the mall
     balcony is open on this store. Another creature, attracted by
     the commotion, starts through the open entrance arch.

493     Stephen is starting down through the ceiling grid. He also has
     equipment strapped onto his body. He sees the charging creature.
     Peter is trying to unsling his rifle. Stephen conquers his fear
     of the height, and lets himself fall to the floor. He crumples
     up when he hits, and rolls into a store exhibit, knocking things
     flying.

     Peter manages to level off his gun and shoots the rushing
     creature. Stephen regains his footing. The second creature is
     moving up the aisle. Stephen grabs a powerful crossbow from a
     nearby exhibit. It is loaded. It fires with a strumming sound
     and the small shaft rips cleanly through the creature's skull
     and imbeds itself in a wall beyond. The Zombie walks forward a
     few steps before it falls.
 
494     The men run toward the entrance arch. Leaping up on an adjacent
     counter top, Peter manages to reach the lip of the roll gate and
     he swings it down fast. Stephen catches the cage below and slams
     it into place just as another ghoul falls against it moaning and
     clawing.

     Stephen unslings his gun and is about to level it off on the
     creature outside. Peter jumps down from the counter.

     Peter:     DON'T TRY TO SHOOT THROUGH THOSE GATES.
               OPENINGS ARE TOO SMALL. BULLET'LL WIND UP
               CHASIN' US AROUND IN HERE.

     The Zombie crashes all its might against the metal cage.
     Stephen startles.

     Peter:     HE CAN'T GET THROUGH...COME ON...

495     The men crash back through the store and Peter moves right to
     the racks of weapons. He pulls down a gorgeous high powered
     rifle which is equipped with a sophisticated scope for sighting.

     Peter:     AIN'T IT A CRIME!

     Steve:     WHAT?

     Peter:     (looking through the telescope)
               THE ONLY PERSON WHO COULD EVER MISS WITH THIS
               GUN...IS THE SUCKER WITH THE BREAD TO BUY IT.

496     The cross hairs of the telescope zero in on the enlarged
     forehead of the Zombie, which is thrashing against the roll
     gates. The sight gives up a sense of the super-weapon's lethal
     accuracy.

497     Stephen dives into the ammunition and moves behind the counter
     where he pulls out boxes of shiny new hand guns.

     Peter finds elaborate holsters and ammunition belts. He pulls
     several other rifles from the rack. We recognise the firepower
     in the arsenal that the two men accumulate.

498     Other Zombies appear at the gate, but they cannot break in.

499     Peter:     (at the creatures)
               YOU JUST WAIT OUT THERE, SISSIES...
               WE COMIN'...AND WE READY!

500     With a swell in the music, the band of all four humans charges
     out of the Maintenance corridor and makes a break for the
     Department Store. They all wear new double holsters containing
     hand guns. Each has a rifle strapped over his shoulder and
     another in hand. They wear ammo belts and carry packs with
     other supplies. The wounded Roger is sitting in the big
     gardening cart which Peter earlier used to carry the first
     supply load out of the store. Peter runs, pushing the cart
     before him.

     There are only a few creatures on the balcony. The dead things
     turn in confusion at the sound of the attacking commandos.
     Roger, his hands free to shoot, fires his weapon several times
     at some of the creatures who are closest.

501     The creatures from the main concourse below begin to move up
     the stationary staircase and struggle with the escalators.
     The corpses of creatures slain in the earlier battles still
     clutters in the area.

502     Fran and Steve are the first to reach the entrance to the 
     Department Store. Steve falls immediately on the gate locks.
     Peter pulls up to a screeching halt at the gate. He turns the
     cart in a full 180 so that Roger is facing out toward the mall.

     Steve fumbles with the second lock. Peter faces the few Zombies
     which are converging along the balcony. He lift his new
     Super-gun and stares through the scope. The gun roars
     eloquently. Even its sound pronounces its power. The single
     shot rips cleanly through the centre-forehead of one of the
     creatures.

     The man aims at another head. Blam. Another perfect kill. Then a
     third. Roger fires several times.

     Fran stands ready at the roll gate. As Stephen finishes with the
     final lock, the woman pushes against the cage and it starts up.
     Steve stands, and the two roll the cage into the ceiling, but
     Stephen is careful not to let it get out of his grasp.

     Fran moves into the store and Peter pulls the cart behind him.
     Then Steve, Peter and Fran pull the gate shut long before any of
     the advancing creatures reach the area.

503     Again, the Zombies smash into the cage, but the humans are
     already running through the aisles of the big store.

504     Peter wheels Roger into the elevator and hits the button for the
     first floor. The doors shut and the car starts down.

     Peter:     HOW'S THE RIDE?

     Roger:     KIND BUMPY. WATCH IT.

     The stern Black face stares down at the back of the wounded
     man's head. Despite his attempt at humour, the stiffness in
     Roger's body evidences his pain. Peter puts his hand squarely
     on the Trooper's shoulder.

     Peter:     LOOK HERE...I...

     Roger:     I KNOW, I KNOW...SHUT UP.

     Something very serious is shared between the two men, some
     knowledge which we do not fully understand. We do see the
     kind of bond shared by soldiers in a battle.

505     The elevator doors glide open and Peter pushes the cart out
     into the first floor on the big store.

506     Fran and Stephen charge down the store escalator moving faster
     than the steps themselves.

507     They run through the hardware department where Stephen snatches
     up several propane torches. Fran stuffs extra bottles of gas
     into her back pack.

508     With a great hiss one of the propane nozzles spits a white-hot
     flame as it is lit with a new disposable lighter. Fran holds
     two torches as Stephen lights them.

509     Peter steps up to the first floor entrance gate with Roger in
     front of him. Several creatures outside of the cage fly into
     sudden frenzy at seeing the humans. They slam against the grid
     but it holds as usual.

     Peter:     UNLOCK THE MIDDLE ONE LAST.

510     Steve falls on the right hand lock with his keys. The Zombies
     all converge near the crouching man's side of the gate. They
     push and shove. Fran holds one of the lit torches very close and
     the creatures back away cringing. The lock opens and Steve moves
     to the extreme left.

     Again the Zombies follow and again Fran is ready with the torch.

     Peter:     ALRIGHT...THE TOUGHEST PART'LL BE GETTIN'
               BY THESE RIGHT HERE...

     Steve:     IT'S A LONG HAUL DOWN TO THE ENTRANCE.

511     Peter cranes his neck to see past the Zombies and down the
     concourse. Several other creatures are starting toward the
     Department Store. Behind them, about three hundred feet away, is
     one of the main entrances which is blocked off outside by a
     truck trailer.

512     Peter:     WE'LL BE ALRIGHT!

     Fran:     IT'S TOO FAR!

     Peter:     THERE'S NO BACKIN' OUT NOW. WE GOTTA LOCK
               THOSE DOORS!

     Fran:     WE'LL NEVER MAKE ALL FOUR. IT'S TOO RISKY.

     Steve:     YOU JUST STAY HERE AND BE READY TO UPEN UP FOR US.

     Fran:     THE CAR!

     Peter:     WHAT?

     Fran:     THE CAR!

513     Outside, we see the slowly spinning exhibit which displays the
     new automobile. It is a sleek, sporty model, which looks fast
     and manoeuvrable.

514     Peter looks down at Roger.

     Peter:     YOU OK TO START IT?

     Roger nods and reaches for his supply pack. He is cringing
     with pain, but he moves efficiently.

515     The Zombies clutch at the gate with new vigour. At the unlocked
     ends the grid gives a little, but still holds the creature out.
     Fran waves the torches closer and the creatures back away.
     Steve un-locks the middle lock.

     Steve:     IT'S GOIN' UP!

516     The gate swings up with a thunderous roar. The Zombies attack
     but Fran's torches make them hold back slightly. Steve grabs
     one of the propane canisters with one hand and draws a pistol
     with the other. Fran draws a hand gun also. The two fire into
     the pack of Zombies. One or two fall. The others try to move
     in but are afraid of the bright flames. One gets close to Steve
     but the man blasts his torch directly into its face. Its hair
     catches on fire and the creature throws itself wildly about,
     knocking other Zombies back.

517     Now Peter sees an opening and he makes a break with the cart.
     Roger holds on to the sides. They crash through the scattered
     pack of ghouls successfully and Peter makes for the car exhibit.
     There are a few creatures on the concourse on the cart's path.

     Peter:     (shouting)
               CLOSE THE GATE...CLOSE THE GATE...

518     Steve grabs the lip of the roll cage and it starts down. Fran is
     still inside the store with one of the torches.

     Fran:     THE KEYS, STEPHEN...THE KEYS!

     Steve tries to stop the downward progress of the gate but it
     slams shut with a metallic crash.

     Fran:     JESUS CHRIST!

519     Peter stops in his tracks when he hears the woman's shouts. He
     looks back. Several of the creatures have followed the cart.
     They advance slowly.

520     Several have stayed with Stephen, however, and they approach
     Stephen as he tries to pass the keys back through the gate.
     The big ring doesn't fit through the small openings.

     Steve:      YOU MOTHER!

     Fran:     KEEP 'EM...JUST KEEP 'EM...LOOK OUT!

     The Zombies at Stephen's back are very close. Steve lunges at
     them with his torch. They back off slightly.

521     Peter:     COME ON, MAN! GET OUTA THERE!

     The creatures on the concourse are approaching the cart. A
     pained Roger levels off several shots, but he is very shaky from
     his extreme pain. He manages to down one of the Zombies.

522     Fran:     STEPHEN...FOR GOD SAKE...

     The woman holds up her torch so that the bright flame faces the
     ghouls. Stephen crouches and puts a key in the right hand lock.
     The Zombies converge on him.

523     Peter, seeing other creatures drawing near, starts to push the
     cart again. he manages to dodges two little clusters of the
     walking dead.

524     The lock clicks just as one bold creature grabs Stephen from
     behind, Fran tries to aim her torch closer. It disarms the
     Zombie for a moment, Stephen thrashes his body back knocking
     the think off balance. Then he quickly slides the keys under
     the gate which he can lift just high enough with the single
     lock undone.

     Another ghoul grabs Steve from behind. This time Steve's torch
     is knocked flying and rolls away. Fran is desperate. She tries
     to aim her pistol but cannot shoot through the grill. She holds
     her torch high.

     Steve kicks and scrambles, rolling on the floor. The Zombies
     are on him. He manages to knock one or two of them to the
     floor. Then he fires with his pistol, killing another, He
     crawls to the torch and grabs it, the creatures clutching and
     tugging at his pants and shirt.

     He brings the flame up and flashes it at the Zombies. They back
     away enough for him to crawl to an open space. Then he scrambles
     to his feet and charges down the concourse toward the car.

525     At the exhibit, Peter stops the cart. There are two of the
     lumbering creatures close at hand. The big trooper raises his
     rifle. Roger, using all his strength, manages to pull himself up
     out of the cart. He lips to the exhibit as Peter fires at the
     oncoming ghouls. The super-gun scores two perfect hits.

526     As Roger tries to step onto the spinning platform, he falls and
     rolls against the car. The turntable carries him around toward
     another creature. He is struggling in pain toward the driver's
     door of the vehicle.

527     Steve, who is approaching at a run, sees the action.

     Steve:     WATCH IS ROGER...ROGER!

528     Roger turns his head and sees the ghoul just before the creature
     grabs him. The things hands clutch at the wrapped wound, which
     is already leaking blood through its dressing. Roger screams
     loudly.

529     Peter jumps up onto the spinning turntable, leans across the
     hood of the car. His super-gun drills a hole through the
     creature's skull. It falls off the exhibit.

530     Peter hurriedly comes around to Roger's side. In extreme pain,
     the Trooper is desperately trying to open the driver door. Peter
     helps him. The door opens and Peter eases his friend into the
     seat. Roger immediately goes to work under the dash.

531     Zombies are advancing now from all over the concourse.

532     Peter:     GET IN!

     He is shouting at Stephen who is just rushing up to the
     platform. He and the Trooper scramble into opposite sides of the
     back seat. They slam the doors and make sure that all buttons
     are locked. Roger works as quickly as he can.

533     Several of the lead creatures reach the turntable. Some fall
     trying to step onto the moving disc, but others manage to
     struggle over to the car. They smash the windows with their
     hands. It is a nightmarish scene as the men huddle in the
     shiny, new car which spins very slowly in circles.

534     Fran has relocked the one open gate mechanism, and she stands
     now trying to see the action, but it is out of her line of
     vision. She can only hear the moaning of the creatures, and
     pounding on the car. She turns the valve on her propane nozzle
     extinguishing the flame.

535     The car's engine roars as Roger is able to jump the wires.

     Steve:     I'LL DRIVE IT...

     Roger:     I GOT IT.

     The Trooper's face contorts in agony as he moves himself into
     position behind the wheel. He is shaking, but he bites his lip
     and slams the car into gear. There are at least eight creatures
     crawling over the car, more approach. The platform spins. Roger
     waits until the car is aimed directly down the concourse. The
     men in the back seats are alert to the Zombies which pound at
     the windows. The ugly and distorted faces press close against
     the safety glass.

536     Now the car pulls out quickly. It rolls of the edge of the
     spinning display, knocking several of the creatures aside. The
     front wheels move off the platform and bounce onto the floor,
     but the frame of the car scrapes the top of the disc and is
     stuck for a moment. The disc spins on carrying the rear of the
     car with it. Then Roger gives it more gas. The rear wheels spin
     and finally catch.

537     The car shoots out onto the mall floor. Some of the Zombies
     cling for a moment, but they fall away quickly, scrambling to
     regain their footing and follow.

538     The car swerves and for an instant seems as though it will
     crash against the columns on the concourse. Roger manages to
     control it, and the shiny vehicle zooms ahead with tremendous
     energy.

539     One of the stray creatures in the concourse tries to intercept
     the speeding auto, but the car knocks him mercilessly aside as
     though he were a bowling pin.

540     Fran sees the car as it rounds the corner, heads directly for
     the main entrance which she can see from her position.

541     The Zombies at the entrance already started back into the mall
     attracted by the commotion. The car zooms down the concourse
     easily breaking their ranks.

542     Roger throws the manoeuvrable vehicle into a screeching
     tailspin, stopping just at the doors.

543     The big trailer blocks the entrance effectively. There are some
     creatures inside the doors. Under the van, several Zombies are
     struggling with the doors. one is just pushing in and seems as
     though it will be able to enter.

544     Peter and Stephen slam against the door. Stephen aims his torch
     directly at the crawling creatures. The one in front withdraws
     its arm. The grotesque things writhe, kick under the truck. The
     door slams and Peter produces another set of master keys. They
     are all coded. he falls on the lock mechanism.

     Peter:     THAT'S NOT 100%, BUT I DON'T THINK THEY'LL GET
               THROUGH.

     Steve:     CAN'T THEY SMASH THE GLASS?

     Peter:     SAFETY STUFF...PRETTY INDESTRUCTIBLE...THEY GOT
               NO LEVERAGE UNDER THE TRUCK.. GIMME THE ALARMS...

545     Steve rummages in his back pack. Produces two portable battery
     operated burglar alarms. Peter activates the units, stands them
     against the base of the now locked doors. As he crouches near
     the glass, creatures outside go into a frenzy clawing at the
     glass doors. They cannot get in.

     Peter:     I'M HOPIN' THEY'LL JUST GO AWAY AFTER THEY FIND
               THEY CAN'T GET IN...

546     The creatures moving slowly down the concourse are now getting
     close to the action.

547     The men hop back into the car, it roars off with Roger still at
     the wheel.

548     Again the sleek auto rips through the ranks of the advancing
     Zombies. They fall and scatter.

549     The car speeds down the concourse, turns the corner near where
     Fran watches at the Department Store game. We hear Steve's voice
     on the woman's walkie talkie.

     Steve:     WE'RE OK...WE GOT IT MADE...IT'GONNA WORK.

     Fran stares out through the roll cage. The Zombies are
     staggering weakly after the car.

550     With another tailspin, the auto pulls up at the second set of
     doors. The men scramble out of the back seat, the Zombies
     outside try to crawl under the second trailer. The men shut them
     out easily, locking the door and planting alarms. They stand to
     look down the concourse.

551     The creatures seem even more spread out now.

     Steve:     HOW MANY YOU FIGURE ARE ALREADY IN...

     Peter:     DUNNO. NOT TOO MANY. WE'LL GET 'EM EASY. WE
               GET IT ALL LOCKED OFF AND WE'RE GOIN' ON A HUNT!
  
     The big Trooper raises his super-gun and sights through the
     telescope.

552     As we see through the scope, cross hairs settle on the forehead
     of one of the creatures which is lumbering down the hall. The
     face is magnified, distorted by the telescope. The gun roars and
     the head in the scope explodes with red.

553     The creature falls against a column, hit squarely through the
     brain. We sense the supreme accuracy of the magnificent weapon.

554     It is night. The Zombies in the parking lot still group around
     the semis. They set up an eerie moaning in the moonlight. A slow
     piece of music starts to build.

555     The creatures crawl under the trucks but cannot enter the mall.
     They pound and scratch at the doors, to no avail.

556     From inside the concourse, the mob is muffled. Even the
     revolving door is locked now. It seems the most vulnerable, but
     the crawling creatures cannot quite get leverage to smash the
     glass panels and they have no tools to pound with.

     The auto is flush against the revolving doors inside, offering
     added protection. Several alarm units sit atop the car. They
     are the early warning devices against penetration.

557     They camera starts to dolly back, the music builds. We see slain
     corpses of many Zombies lying askew in various parts of the
     building. It is like a battlefield after a war.

558     The humans appear on the second storey balcony. Moving to the
     railing, looking down to the expanse of the building. They are
     guerrilla fighters, with their weapons strapped on. They have
     taken the Temple. The music hits a crescendo as the people look
     over their spoils. Even the wounded Roger seems triumphant as he
     limps to the rails, supporting himself on his arms.

559     We see a spectacular shot of the full expanse of the building.
     Zombies lie dead everywhere. The humans have captures the gold of
     the Gods...In this case the Gods of Consumer Heaven.

560     Peter's hand is on the maps of the Maintenance Corridor. He is
     drawing a line past the washrooms at the end of the hall near
     the firestair.

     Peter:     WE PUT UP THE WALL HERE. THERE'S NO DOOR FROM
               THE LAST OFFICE INTO THE WASHROOMS, SO NOBODY'LL
               GET NOSEY...AND THIS WAY WE CAN STILL GET TO THE
               PLUMBING...

     Steve:     WHY CAN'T WE JUST BOARD UP THE STAIRWAY. HELL,
               THEY CAN'T EVEN GET THROUGH A STACK OF CARTONS.

     Peter:     I'M NOT JUST WORRYIN' ABOUT THEM. SOONER OR
               LATER MIGHT BE A PATROL THROUGH HERE...LOOTERS
               MAYBE...I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO EVEN KNOW THAT
               STAIRWAY EXISTS.

     They look back at the map.

     Peter:     THE DUCTWORK RUNS ALL THE WAY INTO THE WASHROOMS.
               WE'LL HAVE TO GET IN AND OUT THAT WAY. WE'LL
               BRING UP ANY BUG STUFF WE WANT BEFORE WE PUT UP
               THE WALL.

561     The men sit huddled. The large storage area is filled with
     mounds of supplies brought up from the mall stores, but the
     stuff all sits around in disarray.

562     Behind the wall of cartons, Roger seems to be sleeping, but he
     is sweating feverishly, and his face twitches. Fran has been
     trying to soothe him with a wet cloth on his forehead. Now she
     stops, leaving the cloth on the shivering head. She moves out
     to Stephen and Peter.

563     Fran:     HE SEEMS TO BE SLEEPING.

     Peter:     GOOD.

564     The woman moves to where she has medical supplies on one of the
     cartons. There are bottles, vials and diabetic hypo syringes as
     well as bandages and dressings from the Pharmacy in the mall.

     Fran:     I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO...

     Steve:     YOU'RE DOIN' FINE.

     Fran:     HIS LEG IS AWFUL...THE INFECTION IS SPREADING FAST.
               CAN'T WE FLY HIM OUT OF HERE...TRY TO FIND A MED.
               UNIT...

565     Steve looks at Peter. The big trooper speaks softly.

     Peter:     I'VE SEEN HALF A DOZEN GUYS GET BITTEN BY THOSE
               THINGS...NONE OF 'EM LASTED MORE THAN THIRTY SIX
               HOURS.

566     Fran is stunned. Suddenly, Roger screams from behind the cartons.

     Roger:     PETER...PETER...WHERE ARE YOU?

567     Peter:     RIGHT HERE, BUDDY.

568     Roger is sitting up. His eyes look very dark and sunken. He is
     sweating even more profusely than before.

     Roger:     YEAH...YEAH...

     He licks his lips. He looks around the vast, barren room, trying
     to clear his eyesight.

569     Outside, Fran sits on a carton. The men are still huddled
     around the spoils. Roger occasional shouts from the other
     room.

     Roger:     WE DID IT, HUH, BUDDY? WE WHIPPED 'EM.

     Peter:     THAT'S RIGHT ROG.

     Roger:     DIDN'T WE? PETER? DIDN'T WE WHIP 'EM?

     Peter:     WE SURE DID, BUDDY.

     Roger:     WE WHIPPED 'EM AND GOT IT ALL! WE GOT IT ALL!

     The man's voice sounds pathetic as it echoes through the big
     storage area bouncing off barren walls.

570     A hammer slams into nails behind the fake wall which the people
     are working on. A great network of two-by-fours are braced at
     the rear of the corridor, more lumber is wedged against walls
     making a frame. Stephen is slamming large nails into the
     framework for reinforcement. On the frame's face a masonite
     panel is nailed into place on one side. Peter works in the
     corridor. He is carefully nailing in a moulding which makes the
     new partition look like a finished wall.

     In the corridor, there are power tools lying about and a vast
     array of other hardware in the gardening cart. Fran appears from
     out of the washrooms. She is carrying an old can of paint which
     has obviously been used.

     Fran:     THIS MUST HAVE BEEN FOR TOUCH UP...IT LOOKS
               PERFECT.

     Peter grabs the can and pries it open quickly with a screw
     driver. He dips his finger into the liquid and smears some onto
     the new wall where it butts against the corridor. It is a
     perfect match.

     Steve:     (to Fran) ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT BEFORE WE CLOSE
               IT OFF?

     Fran:     NO...

     The woman is staring down the corridor toward the mall proper.

571     The corpses from the hall have been carried out of the way.
     They are piled together at the corridor mouth on the balcony.
     It is a grisly sight. Fran turns away.

572     Fran:     NO.

     She steps back through the unfinished partition, leans against
     the framework. Her hand goes to her mouth as she tries to choke
     back a gag. Steve moves up behind her, but she feels another
     wave of nausea and she darts for the washroom. Steve sets down
     his hammer and follows.

573     The woman is kneeling on the floor, propped up by her hands on
     the toilet seat. She is vomiting. Steve approaches quietly. His
     hand falls on her back.

     Fran:     LEAVE ME ALONE...IT'S ALRIGHT...IT'S MY PROBLEM.

     Steve:     FRANNIE...

     Fran:     JUST GET OUTA HERE, STEPHEN...I DON'T WANT YOU
               HERE.

     The man doesn't move. Fran reaches up, taking his hand. She
     clutches it tightly, indicating that she is not angry.

     Fran:     I DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE ME THIS WAY...

     Another wave hits her and she wretches again. She pulls her
     hand back leaning over the toilet bowl.

     Fran:     PLEASE GO...I'M ALRIGHT...PLEASE...

     Stephen stands up reluctantly and drift out of the room. The
     woman wretches but she is dry. She tries to swallow. Then sits
     on the floor next to the toilet holding her stomach. She
     fumbles with the flush handle, depressing it. The rushing water
     makes an ugly sound. Fran looks down at her stomach thinking of
     her pregnancy.

574     Stephen steps out of the unfinished framework. Peter is gazing
     down the corridor at the pile of corpses.

     Peter:     THIS PLACE IS GONNA BE ROTTEN...WE GOTTA
               CLEAN UP, BROTHER.

     Flies buzz about the staring faces of the dead things on the
     balcony.

575     Peter's hands are on the round hatch wheel of an enormous safe.

     Peter:     THEY'RE USUALLY ON A TIMER...OPEN AT
               NINE...LOCKED AT FOUR...KEEPS THE BANKERS HONEST.

     The wheel spins and Peter swings the giant door open.

576     Inside is a huge safety deposit vault of a bank. The men stand
     for a moment in awe. The clean walls are lined with drawers and
     doors where depositors have stored their valuables. At one end
     of the room there are stacks and stacks of paper bills. The men
     approach the piles of money, stooping down.

     They each pick up packets of bills and flip through the edges...

     Peter stuffs several packets into his knapsack. Steve looks at
     him quizzically.

     Peter:     YOU NEVER KNOW, BROTHER.

     Steve takes several stacks and stuffs them into his kit. He
     looks about the enormous vault.

     Steve:     DON'T YA WONDER WHAT THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS ARE GONNA
               THINK...GUYS IN THE FUTURE...DIGGIN' THE PLACE
               UP. IMAGINE ALL THE STUFF IN THESE BOXES...
               JEWELLERY...MAYBE THEY'LL FIGURE IT'S ALL SOME
               KIND OF OFFERING TO THE GODS...LIKE IN THE
               PYRAMIDS...A BURIAL CHAMBER.

     Peter:     THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS, NOW.....

577     We see the men wheeling gardening carts piled with corpses. The
     sombre image is shocking as the figures move in silhouette
     against the bright store fronts with their displays of goods
     designed to attract shoppers to the sweet life the items
     pretend to represent.

578     At the bank, Peter wheels a cart with several dead Zombies
     through the lobby.

579     In the vault, the big Trooper dumps bodies out on top of
     several others, already deposited. The corpses lie askew, their
     arms and legs protruding. The stacks of money are upset by the
     limp action of the bodies as they roll around.

580     A finger flips a switch and we hear the mall music start up
     slowly.

581     We see a montage: Fran, Stephen and Peter walk slowly through
     the conquered building. They drift in and out of stores picking
     up various items. They use shopping carts.

582     Fran rummages idly through the cosmetic department.

583     Peter looks through a book store.

584     Stephen plays the pinball machines in a huge game room.

585     Peter tries on big colourful hats in front if a mirror.

586     Fran trims Stephen's hair as he sits in the mechanical chair of
     the mall Barber Shop.

587     Fran feeds the animals in the Pet Store, then with a bag of seed,
     she feeds the Tropical Birds in the tall cage out on the
     concourse. The birds flutter, flap about, screeching loudly.

588     Now the group walk along the upper balcony. They look down.
     They still have their weapons and kits, Peter is wearing a wide
     brimmed hat and Fran sports a new mink coat.

589     The concourse is empty now of corpses, but the group can hear
     the moaning and thumping at the main entrances. It is dark
     outside, the creatures claw at the doors but cannot be seen in
     the shadows under the big trailer trucks. The sound evidences
     their presence, however.

590     The people stand at the balcony railing overlooking their realm.

     Fran:     THEY'RE STILL HERE.

     Steve:     THEY'RE AFTER US...THEY KNOW WE'RE IN HERE.

     Peter:     THEY'RE AFTER THE PLACE...THEY DON'T KNOW
               WHY...THEY JUST REMEMBER...REMEMBER THAT
               THEY WANNA BE IN HERE!

     The noise at the entrance continues eerily. Fran starts to be
     afraid.

     Fran:     WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY?

     Peter:     THEY'RE US, THAT'S ALL. THERE'S NO MORE
               ROOM IN HELL.

     Steve:     WHAT?

     Peter:     SOMETHIN' MY GRANDADDY USED TO TELL US...YOU
               KNOW MACUMBA? VOODOO... GRANDADDY WAS A PRIEST
               IN TRINIDAD. USED TO TELL US...WHEN THERE'S NO
               MORE ROOM IN HELL...THE DEAD WILL WALK THE EARTH.

591     Roger is screaming wildly. He is sweating and his face looks
     sunken with an ashen colour. He thrashes about as Steve tries to
     hold him. His leg is swollen, almost all black. His arm, which
     was also bitten, is wrapped but oozing.

     Steve:     GET MORE VALIUM IN HIM...

     Fran fumbles with one of the hypodermics, but she drops the vial
     of serum and it shatters on the floor.

     Steve:     GET ANOTHER ONE...COME ON...

     Roger is throwing himself about wildly. Steve barely manages to
     hold on. Fran rushes into the other room.

592     The space is starting to look like living quarters. There is
     furniture. There are sectioned off areas with things still
     packed in cartons, but it is beginning to look like home.

593     The woman rushes to the medical supply area which is now more
     organised with little cabinets and a small refrigerator. She
     takes a new vial of serum from the freezer.

594     Downstairs, Peter is checking the covering at the floor base of
     the fake wall. He hears the violent screaming from above.

595     He climbs up a rope ladder in the ceiling, scrambles through the
     grill in the ceiling, enters the duct. Then he pulls up the
     ladder and closes the grill.

596     He crawls through the tight space for a few feet, and drops out
     of another grill into the washroom.

597     He moves through the internal corridor and into the firestair. 

598     All the while, Roger's screaming can be heard. Peter tramps up
     the stairs several at a time.

599     He rushes through the living space in the direction of the
     screams.

600     Fran is withdrawing a hypodermic from Roger's good arm. The man
     still thrashes wildly. Steve is struggling to hold him. Peter
     rushes in and helps. Fran drifts out of the room.

     After a short time Roger relaxes somewhat.

     Peter:     (to Steve) GO ON...I'LL STAY WITH HIM.

     Steve leaves the area.

601     In the living spaces, Fran is sitting in a chair. It is the
     inflatable kind, which can be collapsed like a balloon. Steve
     comes up to her and puts his arms around her neck from behind.
     She cups his hands with hers and holds them tightly. She stares
     off across the room.

602     Roger catches his breath and looks up at Peter. He licks his
     lips and tries to speak coherently.

     Roger:     YOU...YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF ME, RIGHT, PETER?
               YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF ME...WHEN I GO...

     Peter:     I WILL.

     Roger:     I DON'T WANNA BE WALKIN' AROUND LIKE THAT PETER...
               NOT AFTER I GO...I DON'T WANNA BE WALKIN' AROUND
               LIKE THAT...

     The man's eyes are terrified. He looks this way and that at the
     walls, the ceiling, at Peter...He can't focus...

     Roger:     PETER? PETER?

     Peter:     I'M HERE, TROOPER.

     Roger:     YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF ME...I KNOW YOU WILL...

     Peter:     I WILL.

     Roger:     PETER?

     Peter:     YEAH, BROTHER.

     Roger:     PETER, DON'T DO IT...TIL YOUR SURE...SURE I'M COMIN'
               BACK...DON'T DO IT TIL YOU'RE SURE...I MIGHT NOT
               COME BACK, PETER...I'M GONNA TRY NOT TO...I'M
               GONNA TRY...NOT TO COME BACK...

603     Later, the moon shines down through the skylight in the living
     area. A sturdy ladder has now replaced the pyramid of cartons
     up to the open hatch.

604     Stephen fiddles with the television. There is a faint signal
     coming in. He has the set wired to a makeshift antenna which
     stretches through the skylight. A table lamp sits on a small
     end table and is lit. Its cable is patched into a network of
     wiring which stretches about the room.

605     Fran is unpacking things. She is stacking dishes and silverware.
     It is a very orderly scene. The couple looks like a pair of
     newlyweds who have just moved into a new house.

606     On the television, two men are talking, a commentator and an
     official of the Government. The Scientist is in a suit, but his
     tie is rumpled and his collar open. He has not shaved and he
     seems very tired and nervously upset.

     Scientist:   I'VE GOT TO...BE CAREFUL WITH WORDS HERE...WE
               HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO STUDY THEIR HABITS...WE'VE
               REPEATEDLY ASKED FOR A LIVE CAPTURE SO WE CAN HAVE
               CONTROLLED STUDY...WE NEED SUPPLY AND DEMAND
               RATIOS.

     Comm.:     YOU MEAN...THEIR NEED VERSUS...

     Scientist:   VERSUS THE AMOUNT OF FOOD AVAILABLE. LETS BE BLUNT.

     There is a commotion in the TV studio. We hear noises and
     shouting, as we did J.A.S. earlier.

607     Steve:     JESUS CHRIST.

     He squats near the set, staring. Fran comes up behind him.

608     Scientist:   PROJECT OUT THEIR RATE OF GROWTH...THERE'S A
               CRITICAL BALANCE...AND IT'S THE WASTE THAT KILLS
               US. LITERALLY...THEY USE...THEY USE MAYBE FIVE
               PERCENT OF THE FOOD AVAILABLE ON THE HUMAN
               BODY...AND THEN THE BODY IS USUALLY INTACT ENOUGH
               TO BE MOBILE WHEN IT REVIVES. THERE'S AN ECOLOGICAL
               IMBALANCE AND THEY'RE INCAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING...

     Comm.:     WHAT ARE YOU PROPOSING?

     Scientist:   WE HAVE TO BE UNEMOTIONAL...WE HAVE TO PROVIDE
               COUNTER MEASURES OR WE'RE ALL...

     Comm.:     COUNTER MEASURES?

     Scientist:   THEY CAN'T CONTROL THE RATE OF GROWTH AND CON-
               SUMPTION...WE HAVE TO CONTROL IT FOR THEM!

     Comm.:     YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT WE HELP THEM?

     Scientist:   BY HELPING THEM IN THIS CASE WE SAVE OURSELVES...

     A great outcry is heard in the studio. The camera bobbles
     around. The scientist is fumbling for words.

609     Stephen:     GOOD GOD.

610     In the other room, Peter sits against a wall. He can hear the
     television. His eyes stare straight ahead at something.

     Scientist:   I'M PROPOSING THAT CERTAIN...NECESSARY MEASURES
               BE PUT INTO EFFECT AT ONCE...MEASURES APPLYING TO
               ALL OFFICIAL SEARCH AND DESTROY UNITS, WHILE
               THEY'RE STILL OPERATIVE...HOSPITALS...RESCUE
               STATIONS...AND ANY...PRIVATE CITIZENS...

     The camera pulls off Peter's face. We see that his rifle is
     stretched across his lap. The TV drones on from the other room.

     Scientist:   IN CO-OPERATION WITH THE MOBILE UNITS OF THE O.B.P.
               THE CORPSES OF THE RECENTLY DEAD SHOULD BE
               DELIVERED OVER TO THE AUTHORITIES FOR COLLECTION
               IN REFRIGERATED VANS...THEY SHOULD BE DECAPITATED
               TO PREVENT REVIVAL...

     We see now what Peter is staring at. On the floor, twenty feet
     away lies the corpse of Roger. It's face is covered with a
     blanket. It lies very still.

     Scientist:   THIS COLLECTION...THIS COLLECTION...

     The man's voice is heard almost shouting over the voices from
     the studio. The angry staff protests vigorously, with
     emotional language...

     Scientist:   THIS COLLECTION COULD BE...STORED...RATIONED...
               FOR DISTRIBUTION AMONG THE INFECTED SOCIETY...

     The shouts of anger continue.

               IN AN ATTEMPT...IN AN ATTEMPT TO CURB THE SENSELESS
               SLAUGHTER...THE SENSELESS SLAUGHTER OF OUR OWN
               SOCIETY...

     Suddenly the dead Roger's foot seems to move under the blanket.
     Peter's eyes pick up the movement immediately. His hands
     tighten on his weapon.

     Scientist:   THE DISSECTION...THE DISSECTION OF THE CORPSES CAN
               BE CARRIED OUT...CARRIED OUT WITH RESPECT FOR THE
               DIGNITY OF THE HUMAN BODY...

     Roger's arms seem to move, in slight twitching motions...

               THE HEADS...THE HEADS AND THE ...SKELETONS...
               WHENEVER POSSIBLE...COULD BE IDENTIFIED AND...
               AND BURIED IN CONSECRATED GROUNDS...

     The commotion in the studio reaches a fever pitch.

     From the movement beneath, the blanket starts to creep down off
     Roger's face. Peter stares with fascination and disbelief.
     The blanket clears the blankly staring eyes...the drooling
     mouth...Roger tries to sit up/ Peter's hands click a shell into
     his super-gun.

     Suddenly, the corpse sits up. It stares at Peter, blankly at
     first, then with purpose...it starts to move towards the Trooper
     who calmly raises his weapon...

611     On the TV, the commotion still rages. Stephen and Fran stare at
     the tube, hardly believing what they see. The scientist is
     shouting above the din. He is nervous. He wipes his brow with
     his sleeve...

     Scientist:   WE'VE GOT TO REMAIN UNEMOTIONAL...UNEMOTIONAL...
               RATIONAL...LOGICAL...TACTICAL! TACTICAL!

612     Steve:     THEY'RE CRAZY...THEY'RE CRAZY...

     Fran:     IT'S REALLY...ALL OVER, ISN'T IT...

     BLAM! The loud roar of Peter's gun from the next room. Fran
     startles and falls into Stephen's arms.

613     Roger's corpse is dumped on top of the stack of bodies in the
     Bank vault. His eyes stare with a puzzled expression. The arms
     and legs of the other bodies make the room look like a
     Renaissance Painting of hell itself. There is the familiar
     gunshot wound in Roger's forehead.

     The heavy door of the vault closes with a metallic slam which
     echoes through out the mall.

614     A small puppy lifts its leg and urinates on a table.

     Fran:     ADAM! NO NO!

     The woman's hands reach into frame and grab the little animal.
     She carries it through the room and drops it on some papers laid
     out in an unused part of the storage area.

     Fran's stomach is big now, her pregnancy evident. She wipes her
     brow like an exhausted housewife, and shuffles back into the
     living area. She fumbles with the sheets on the double mattress
     which she and Steve obviously share. There is an end table near
     the bed, with a reading light. Books lie strewn around, along
     with magazines and half drunk cups of coffee.

615     In the sitting room, we see a scene which could be comfortable
     suburban. The furniture is neatly arranged. There is a small
     portable stove which operates on bottled gas, a refrigerator,
     and cabinets with dishes and silverware.

616     There is a modern calendar on the wall, which has three months
     crossed off. There are a variety of radio and TV units and a
     stereo record player. There are even decorations: paintings
     hung, knick knacks on the tables. The room almost looks like a
     wealthy man's den, with all the gadget-oriented affluence.

617     In the Department Store, Stephen wanders about. He fiddles with
     a new supersonic calculator and he looks at adult games.

618     On the roof, in the bright sun of early morning, Peter plays
     tennis against one of the shed walls. He's dressed in a new
     sweat suit with brightly coloured Addidas sneakers. He has a
     sleek new racquet, slamming phosphorescent balls with all his
     might. His face is set in what is almost anger. He attacks each
     shot with determination and emotion.

619     One of his shots misses the shed. The ball bounces and banks off
     the lip of the roof, then it tumbles over the edge.

620     In the parking lot below, the ball hits the pavement. It bounces
     several times, rolling off among the feet of the army of Zombies
     wandering this way and that through the area.

621     The creatures mob around the trucks at the main entrances. They
     moan and gurgle, clawing at the building. There seem to be
     hundreds of them, all different ages, sexes, shapes. Some
     clothed, some naked, some wounded, some almost untouched.

622     Now Fran, the pregnant housewife, is cooking supper.

623     The men play cards with hundred dollar bills in the living space.

624     The three sit around the dinner table, just finishing their
     supper. The TV set is on, but only grey snow fills the screen
     and the speaker hisses as it receives no signal.

     Fran:     THERE HASN'T BEEN A BROADCAST FOR THREE DAYS.
               WHY DON'T YOU GIVE IT UP?

     Steve:     THEY MIGHT COME BACK ON.

     Fran angrily throws down her silverware and stomps over to the
     TV. She clicks it off. The woman returns to the table.

     Steve stands up and moves to the set. He clicks it back on.
     Peter watches the two sheepishly. It is a domestic scene. The
     group has become a family, with all the disadvantages of
     comfortable living, including the inability to communicate.  

     Fran:     WHAT HAVE WE DONE TO OURSELVES?

625     The thunderous roar of the helicopter engine. The machine is
     hovering over the roof of the mall.

626     Fran is at the controls. Steve sits in the passenger seat.

     Steve:     OK, NOW EASY...EASY...BRING 'ER DOWN...

627     The whirlybird starts down for the roof. It is somewhat
     unstable, but it eases down regularly.

628     In the cockpit, a flustered Fran manages to handle the controls.

     Steve:     EASY...STABILISE IT...THAT'S IT...

     The woman reacts efficiently. She handles the controls better as
     The chopper's runners are just about on the roofs surface.

     Steve:     THAT'S IT...THAT'S IT...YOU GOT IT!

629     The runners hit the roof surface and the chopper settles.

630     Fran throws her arms impulsively around Stephen's neck.

     Steve:     YOU DID IT...YOU DID IT, HON...YOU DID IT...

     The woman excitedly hugs and kisses Stephen with childish joy.
     She is bubbling.

631     Seen from a great distance, the helicopter atop the mall looks
     very small. Its engine dies and begins to whine.

632     A pair of binoculars is watching the action. The lenses pull
     away from a pair of beady eyes.

     Voice:     THEY MUST GET IN THROUGH THE ROOF.

     Voice:     SON OF A BITCH!

     Voice:     THERE'S TRUCKS BLOCKIN' ALL THE ENTRANCES.

     Voice:     NO SWEAT!

     Voice:     WHAT DO YA THINK? HIT 'EM NOW OR WAIT
               FOR TONIGHT?

     Voice:     TONIGHT.

633     We see the short wave radio speaker installed in the living
     space near the TV. A voice rattles over the unit:

     Voice:     WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE...SEEN THE WHIRLYBIRD
               ON THE ROOF.

634     Fran steps to the doorway attracted by the signal. Peter sits at
     the radio, not knowing whether to send. Steve listens.

     Voice:     HEY, ER...COULD YA USE SOME COMPANY IN THERE?

     Steve is about to say something. Peter stops him.

     Voice:     WE'RE JUST RIDIN' BY...WE COULD SURE USE
               SOME SUPPLIES...WHAT'S THE CHANCE US
               GETTIN' IN THERE TO STOCK UP?

     Peter listens intently, trying to read the voice's inflections.

     Voice:     HOW MANY OF YOU IN THERE, ANYWAY...THERE'S
               THREE OF US. COULDN'T YA USE THREE MORE GUNS?

     Peter:     RAIDERS.

     Fran:     WELL, THEY KNOW WE'RE HERE, MAYBE WE SHOULD...

     Peter:     (cutting her off)
               NO CHANCE.

     The little puppy scrambles up to Fran's feet, seeking attention.
     She picks the little dog up in her arms.

     Fran:     WELL, IF THERE'S ONLY THREE OF THEM...

     Peter:     WHO SAYS?

     There's a long silence. The radio sputters static. Voices are
     heard, but they aren't speaking into the microphone. They are
     obviously conferring among themselves. Steve starts to speak,
     Peter cuts him off.

     Peter:     SHHHH! QUIET!

     He is trying to hear the muffled conversation.

     Fran:     I THINK WE SHOULD...

     Peter:     JESUS CHRIST, SHUT UP AND LISTEN!

     More static. Slight laughter is heard. Steve looks into Peter's
     face. The bug trooper just stares at the speaker without moving.
     Finally, the voice again.

     Voice:     HEY...YOU IN THE MALL...YOU JUST FUCKED UP
               REAL BAD! WE DON'T LIKE PEOPLE WHO DON'T SHARE.

     Instantly Peter grabs his weapon and straps on his holster.

     Peter:     COME ON, MAN...GET IT UP.

635     Under the cover of darkness, a pair of hands stores a microphone
     on a portable radio unit. The radio is in a small van which is
     cluttered with junk. An arsenal of weapons is strewn about.

636     We see several men, and a few women, huddling inside the van.
     They look like banditos. One even wears a Mexican sombrero. The
     men are armed to the teeth, wearing ammunition belts criss-
     crossed on their chests. They are dirty and sloppily dressed in
     all sorts of surplus clothing.

637     Outside, in close-up shots, hands turn controls on big motor-
     cycles and feet stomp accelerators. The bikes roar, creating a
     thunderous sound. Clouds of dust and fumes rise into the air.

638     Peter and Stephen are running across the mall roof. The roar of
     the cycles can be heard in the distance.

639     Reaching the roof's edge, Peter stares off at the horizon, but
     sees nothing. The thunder draws nearer. Peter tries binoculars.

640     Through the lenses are vague shapes in the darkness. As the
     sound swells, we see the riders. Their powerful bikes come
     charging over a rise...two...then three more...three more...
     more...

     They are accompanied by two small vans. There are at least
     fifteen bikes. The sound is deafening.

641     Peter:     JUST THREE, HUH?

     Steve:     HOLY SHIT!

     Peter:     THEY'LL GET IN. THEY'LL MOVE THE TRUCKS.

     Steve:     THERE'S HUNDREDS OF THOSE CREATURES DOWN THERE.

     Peter:     COME ON, MAN. THIS IS A PROFESSIONAL ARMY.
               LOOKS LIKE THEY BEEN SURVIVIN' ON THE ROAD ALL
               THROUGH THIS THING...DAMN! HOW MANY OF THE
               STORES ARE OPEN?

     Steve:     I DUNNO...SEVERAL OF 'EM...

     Peter:     WELL LET'S NOT MAKE IT EASY FOR 'EM...COME ON!

642     The men charge down through the skylight. The roar of the
     convoy can now be heard in the living space.

     Fran is desperate. Steve rushes by her with Peter, who crashes
     on ahead through the door onto the firestairs.

     Fran:     WHAT'S HAPPENING?

     Steve:     THERE'S FIFTEEN OR TWENTY OF 'EM...
               WE'RE GONNA SHUT OFF THE GATES.

     Fran:     STEPHEN!

     Steve:     WE'RE JUST GONNA SHUT THE GATES.
               THEY'LL NEVER FIND US UP HERE.

     The man disappears through the stairway door. Fran drops the
     puppy which goes running after the men floppily.

     Fran thinks to chase the dog, but instead moves to the storage
     area and snatches her weapons. She starts to load her rifle.

643     Outside, the convoy makes a pass at one of the trucks. In the
     darkness the Zombies clutch at the fast bikes. The raiders
     fire their guns, dropping several of the creatures.

     The mob of creatures is impenetrable at first. The raiders
     leader signals the convoy to drop back across the parking lot.
     Some raiders have trouble keeping balance as Zombies claw them.

644     The lead bikes pull up on the other side of the lot.

     Raider:      THEY'LL SPREAD OUT COMIN' AFTER US...
               THEN WE GO IN WITH THE VAN...

645     The other bikes ride to the leaders. A van pulls in and two
     bikers scramble aboard through the side doors. One of the women
     jumps into the driver's seat and revs the engine.

646     The Zombies are starting to move out after the convoy. The mob
     at the mall entrance is thinning somewhat.

647     In the mall, Peter drops from the grill in the exterior corridor.
     He charges out and into the Maintenance corridor, where he
     breaks for the mall proper. He is followed by Stephen.

     Peter:     (shouting)
               DOWNSTAIRS FIRST...

     Steve:     OK...

     Peter:     GOT YOUR TALK BOX?

     Steve:     YEAH.

     Peter:     KEEP IS HANDY.

648     Outside, the Raiders' van revs and roars towards the mall. The
     bikers stay at the other side of the lot, engines idling. Some
     of them whoop and holler like American Indians.

649     The van crashes through the advancing Zombies. Several of them
     are knocked flying. The vehicle pulls up to the truck cab. Three
     men pile out and scramble into the truck. The Zombies in the
     area clutch at the raiders, but they fight their way clear. The
     woman in the van revs the engine again. Zombies claw at her
     window. She squeals back to the main biker group.

650     The Zombies in the parking lot are approaching the ranks of
     motorcycles from a good distance. The raiders open fire. They,
     too, possess sophisticated weapons, the barrage sets up a great
     noise. Several creatures fall. The little van pulls up behind
     the bikes. The men still whoop and shout.

651     On the floor on the mall, Peter and Steve dash about slamming
     roll gates down on the open stores. They run desperately through
     the empty concourses. They hear the din from outside.

652     At the trailer cab, a raider fires point blank at the Zombies
     that claw at the passenger window. Another man checks cables.

     Raider:      SHIT...IT'S STILL TAPED UP...IT'S ALL READY
               FOR US...

     The man sits at the wheel, revving the engine. Ghouls at
     windows.

653     Inside, the men hear the truck starting. Steve slams down the
     Pharmacy gate. Peter is already running to the Department
     Store. The big Trooper crashes up the escalator to the second
     floor aisles. Steve breaks for the open Hardware Store.

654     The huge trailer rolls away from the mall entrance. A shout of
     victory goes up from the raiders. The Zombies at the door do not
     yet enter the mall, their focus on the raiders now. From other
     entrances Zombies start converging on the parking lot.

655     Across the lot, the bikers rev their engines ready to make a run
     on the building. The raiders in the truck hop from the cab. They
     run to the doors, shooting Zombies at they move. Some creatures
     fall, others claw at the runners. One raider is brought down by
     the ghouls. His friends pay no attention.

656     One gunman slams into the mall doors to find they are locked.
     He levels his machine gun on the locks and rips open the
     mechanism. The men push through the doors. The little alarm
     units are knocked flying sending out a high pitched signal.

657     Peter is just slamming down the gates on the balcony when he
     hears the alarms go off.

658     One of the raiders hears the gates rumbling. He looks up and
     sees Peter running by the railing upstairs. He fires with his
     machine gun.

659     Peter dives, sliding across the balcony. The bullets miss him
     and he crawls around the balcony just out of sight from below.

660     Steve has just slammed down the Hardware Store gate, and makes a
     dash for the Department Store.

661     The raiders spot him as well, and open fire.

662     Steve runs zip-zag and dives into the big store, where he ducks
     into the shadows leaving the gate open.

663     Peter, at the balcony railing, levels his super-gun on the
     bikers.

664     One accurate shot fires and a raider falls with a giant wound in
     his chest.

665     The last raider at the doors ducks out of Peter's sight.

666     Steve now charges the roll gate and slams it shut on the store.

667     The bikers toward the building. Zombies scatter on the lot.

668     Just as the bikers are reaching the building, the raider inside
     rushes the doors. He holds them open as the big fleet of
     rumbling cycles comes screaming into the building.

669     Steve is in awe, watching from the Department Store grid.

670     The cycles pull down the concourse and Zombies lumber in after
     them. The raider at the door is grabbed by a Zombie. Then
     another. He manages to fight away.

671     Peter, shooting above, downs the raider and one of the ghouls.

672     The main band of bikers hear the gunfire and pull down a side
     concourse to regroup. They make their turn close to the
     Department Store and Steve backs into he shadows.

673     Peter moves down the balcony as Zombies are clamouring back to
     the big concourses. Peter's eyes are wide at the invasion.

674     Upstairs, Fran hears the noises. She is at the top of the
     firestair, weapons ready. On the landing below, the puppy
     scamper and barks. Fran calls the dog, but it doesn't listen.

675     The bikes arc around and several pull up to the Dept. Store.

     Raider:      ALRIGHT...COUPLE OF YOU HOLD OFF THEM ZOMBIES...
               CHARLIE?...HIT THE GATES...WE GOTTA GET THAT
               SNIPER.

     The leader rolls out. Others follow. Peter fires and drops a
     raider, his bikes flying into the approaching Zombies.

676     The action is too fast and furious. Neither Peter or Steve can
     see the whole layout of the concourse.

677     The lead bikers pulls out of range behind a set of columns. A
     couple of bikers dismount and start up the stationary stairs.

678     Steve talks into his walkie talkie:

     Steve:     THEY'RE COMIN' UP, PETER...THEY'RE COMIN'
               UP THE STAIRS.

679     Peter moves to another spot on the balcony.

680     Suddenly the raiders at the Dept. Store door turn a machine
     gun on the roll gate locks. One flies open...another...

681     Steve runs into the store, about to charge up the escalator when
     he realises he'll be in the line of fire. he runs to the
     elevator, hits a button, and starts for the second floor.

682     Peter fires and drops one of the charging men on the balcony.
     The other takes cover. Just as Peter is changing position, the
     lights in the building blink out...the escalators stop... the
     power has gone off.

683     Upstairs, Fran is alone in total darkness. Below, she hears the
     puppy still barking. She starts carefully down the steps.

684     In the stuck elevator, Steve gropes and fumbles for his talk box.

     Steve:     PETER...PETER...

685     The big trooper charges through the darkness to the Maintenance
     corridor, ignoring the buzzing on his talk unit.

686     The raiders on the balcony approach quickly, ducking against the
     walls occasionally for cover.

687     The other bikers spill into the Dept. Store, raiding the
     counters and raping the displays. They throw things into sacks
     while others move to different stores and shoot off roll gate
     locks. They raid the arsenal in the Sporting Goods store.

688     The main pack of bandits are holding off the Zombies. The
     creatures charge with new vigour. Some raiders fall and the
     ghouls pounce on them, ripping flesh with teeth and hands.

689     The van pulls up outside the doors and two bikers ride out to
     it, loading supplies into it. The Zombies are everywhere, but
     the actions of the professional looters befuddle them.

690     Several creatures move onto the balcony. One Zombie pounces the
     raider Peter shot and tears at his body.

691     As remaining raiders appear at the mouth of the corridor, Peter
     opens fire, killing the lead raider with a clean shot in the
     heart. The man flies back over the railing, falling to the
     concourse below where Zombies attack it. The other raider falls
     back against the wall.

692     Peter dashes into the Maintenance Room and rushes to throw the
     emergency power switch.

693     The portable emergency light units blink on all over the mall.

694     Steve, who has crawled through the escape hatch of the elevator,
     suddenly feels the car move. He grabs onto the cables but his
     hands slip from grease and his rifle falls down and wedges
     between the wall of the shaft and the moving car.

     Suddenly, the car stops again, and Steve sees through the
     escape hatch as light spills in as the main elevator doors open.
     He thinks to jump down, but hears raiders below.

695     Two of the big, greasy bandits charge into the car. They whoop
     and shout as they see the open escape hatch.

696     Steve settles back out of sight against the wall.

697     Raider:      COME ON, MAN...LET'S GO...

     The other raider whoops loudly and fires a barrage of bullets
     into the escape hatch.

698     The shells bang and clatter in the shaft and ricochet off the
     walls and gears. A shell nicks Stephen's arm, but he is silent.

699     Finally, the barrage stops. The raiders charge back to the
     store.

700     Other bandits battle with Zombies. The men crash through
     stores, collecting weapons, ammunition, tools, clothes, food.

701     Bikers shuttle goods out to the side doors of the van. The
     woman in the front seat is ready with giant pistols. Zombies
     try to pound their way in, but they cannot succeed.

702     In the mall, another biker drops to the Zombies. They pounce
     on him and start devouring his screaming body.

703     Several creatures now wander through the Department Store,
     having entered from the second storey gate. They move through
     aisles knocking against displays. One grabs a mannequin thinking
     it human, throws the dummy aside roughly.

704     The raider on the balcony is approached by several Zombies. He
     runs down the corridor to the Maintenance office. Peter is gone.
     Breaking into the various empty offices, the raider comes to the
     fake wall panel and assumes it goes nowhere. Then he hears the
     faint barking of the dog. He checks the panel again by running
     his hand along the edge.

     Suddenly a sound in the corridor and the raider turns. There
     are three ghouls coming. He fires and knocks off the ghouls one
     at a time and runs onto the balcony.

705     Bikes roar this way and that. It is a war zone.

706     The man is about to run downstairs when he hears a noise above.
     He spins and looks up. He sees Peter just too late.

707     The big Trooper, in an open ceiling grid, aims his super-gun
     squarely at the raider's head. The gun roars and the man flies.

708     Below, the raiders are starting to regroup. The bikes begin to
     peel out of the mall entrance one at a time.

709     Another raider is snatched off his machine by the Zombies.

710     The bikers toss a last bit of booty in the van and the woman
     driver gets ready to pull out. She lowers her window and fires
     point blank at the heads of the clutching creatures.

711     The last wave of raiders is at the first floor entrance. The
     Zombies are mobbing around the bikes outside. The men shoot and
     beat their way to the cycles. One man is brought down, but three
     manage to mount their cycles. The big bikes roar out.

712     Peter is crawling through the ductwork. Just as he opens a grid,
     he sees the last bike rolling across the concourse. He levels
     off with his scope.

713     He shoots one raider out of the saddle. Two others get out.

714     Regrouping in the lot, the band of twenty is now seven or eight.

715     One last cyclist revs his engine and roars through the
     concourse. He dodges several ghouls and heads for the entrance.
     He is the leader. The one who was on the radio. He whoops
     victorious just as he is about to drive through the doors.

716     Peter leans out of the grid work and settles the cross-hairs on
     the back of the riders head. He waits as the biker roars out
     onto the lot. The rider lets out one last victorious shout in
     the fresh air. Peter's scope is locked on the riders back and
     the super-gun roars. The biker is blown off his machine.

717     The bike flies into a pack of Zombies. Some fall back, but
     others advance on the rider. The man rolls over the cement,
     stops, not dead yet. He screams wildly as they move onto him.

718     The other bikers move off in the night and the engines fade
     away.

719     The puppy stops barking. Fran is tense in the darkness clutching
     her rifle. She stands on the now silent landing.

720     In the parking lot and main concourse the Zombies move freely.
     They fight over the remains of the corpses. They eat ravenously,
     the sounds of their feast the only thing in the area.

721     Peter peers down at the slaughter below from the ductwork.
     Suddenly he hears the beeper of his talk unit, hits the button.

     Steve:     PETER!

     Peter:     WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?

     Steve:     IN THE ELEVATOR!

     Peter:     LISTEN, THOSE THINGS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE.
               CLIMB UP TOP...I'LL GET YOU OUT THE GRID ON
               THE SHAFT...I'M COMIN.

     Peter starts to crawl through the ducts.

722     Steve hits the second floor button and the car moves. He
     clamours up on the hand rail on the car. His hands reach up and
     grab the escape hatch pulling his head and shoulders out the
     opening. He kicks with his legs to force himself up when the car
     stops. He sees the grid in the shaft wall.

723     Suddenly, the car doors open on the second storey and abruptly
     several Zombies dart into the car. They claw at Steve's legs and
     pull him out of the hatch. He screams, thrashes violently.

724     In the duct, Peter hears the screams. He stops and listens for a
     moment. He backs away heading for the Maintenance corridor.

725     In the elevator, Steve thrashes with all his might. The ghouls
     try to pull him out of the car while the elevator doors open and
     close repeatedly against the creatures which block it.

     A Zombie bites Steve's arm, another bites his neck. The man
     scrambles to unholster his gun. Although he is bleeding
     profusely, he finally pulls his gun and fires...once...twice...

726     Peter is dropping out of the washroom duct. He hears the pistol
     shots and realises Steve is not dead. He thinks about climbing
     back in the grid, but stops. He punches at the wall violently.
     He is angry and confused.

727     Again the pistol roars and rips through a Zombie head, flying
     out of the elevator. The doors still slam against the last
     creature and Steve fires. The Zombie flies back and the doors
     finally close.

728     Outside, Zombies fall against the elevator doors.

729     Inside, Steve falls to the floor. His neck runs red. His eyes
     are wide with terror. He sits stupidly staring at the pistol in
     his hand. He finds it hard to breathe.

730     Peter appears at the bottom of the firestair. The puppy runs to
     meet him, tails wagging and yapping. He hangs his head as Fran
     looks down.

     Fran:     NO.....NO!

     She runs down the steps. The big Trooper catches her bodily as
     she is about to charge out into the hall.

     Peter:     I HEARD HIS GUN...MAYBE HE'S ALRIGHT...WE'LL
               WAIT...WE'LL JUST WAIT A WHILE...

731     The mall stands silent in the blue haze of impending dawn.

732     Zombies move through the building freely, walking the halls,
     lumbering through the stores.

733     Several creatures still pound and scratch the elevator doors.
     As they push each other, one creature inadvertently makes
     contact with the elevator call button.

     The doors glide open. Steve is standing, his blood dry now.
     His eyes are blank as he steps forward. The creatures step
     away seeing that he is no longer prey...he is among them now.

     The doors slam against Steve and open again. Steve lumbers into
     the store down the aisle. Other creatures drift away.

734     Upstairs, Fran is packing her sack slowly and ponderously. Her
     face is red from crying.

735     Peter stands at the stair top looking down at the landing.

736     Fran sets the sack down at the escape ladder leading to the
     roof. She deliberately goes to fill another sack.

737     On the mall balcony, Stephen's corpse walks to the Maintenance
     corridor. He looks past other wandering Zombies and sees the
     fake partition. Something in him remembers. He moves forward.

738     Fran:     IT'S ALMOST LIGHT...LET'S GO.

     Peter looks at her silently from the stairway door.

     Fran:     HE DOESN'T ANSWER THE RADIO...IT'S BEEN HOURS...

     She starts to cry again.

     Fran:     FOR GOD SAKE. YOU BETTER COME ON BECAUSE IF
               I GET TO THINKIN' ABOUT THIS, I'LL JUST GO ON
               DOWN THERE AND LET THEM...LET THEM...

     The puppy suddenly growls. It charges between Peter's feet and
     runs floppily down the steps.

739     In the hallway, Steve pounds at the fake wall. Other creatures
     notice and they all move toward the partition.

740     Upstairs, the pounding can be heard. Peter stands stoically,
     looking down into the darkness. The dog barks below.

     Fran:     WHAT IS IT?

     Peter:     IT'S STEPHEN...THEY'RE COMIN' UP!

741     With a great crunching noise the partition gives way from the
     army of creatures.

742     Peter slams the door. He speaks quietly.

     Peter:     GO ON...YOU GET OUT OF HERE.

     Fran:     PETER...

     Peter:     I SAID...GET OUT OF HERE.

     From the firestair, we hear the sudden yelping of the puppy as
     it falls victim to the creatures. The sound echoes through the
     barren spaces of the storage area.

     Fran:     OH, JESUS, PETER...PLEASE...

     Peter:     I DON'T WANT TO GO...I REALLY DON'T...
               YOU KNOW THAT? I REALLY DON'T.

743     Suddenly, the door flies open and the creatures lumber into the
     living space. Peter stares at them. He smiles slightly. The
     creatures advance, led by Stephen.

744     Fran starts to scream.

     Fran:     STEPHEN...STEPHEN...

     She makes a slight move for her lover, but Peter raises his
     super-gun and shoots the Zombie through the head.

     As Stephen falls, Fran comes up short. The act startles her into
     awareness. Peter faces her as the creatures come up behind him.

     Peter:     MOVE, WOMAN!

745     Fran grabs the sacks and climbs the ladder to the roof.

746     The creatures advance on Peter. He backs away, trying to lead
     them from the skylight. They crash through the living space,
     upsetting the carefully planned room.

747     On the roof, Fran desperately starts the helicopter engine.

748     Peter backs into the storage room, slamming the door. The
     creatures approach the door and the super-gun roars one last
     time. The Zombies push through the door and move in for their
     feast.

749     Several zombies manage to scramble up the skylight to the roof.

     Fran stares, transfixed. The blades roar up to full speed.

     The creatures advance toward the machine.

     Fran steps out onto the running board; the creatures very close
     now. She crouches, watching for a moment, then looks up at the
     spinning blades.

     She stands straight up, driving her head into the spinning
     blades.

     A headless form falls to the roof. The Zombies advance.

750     In a wide shot, silhouetted against the dawn sky, we see the
     creatures huddled under the chopper blades, feasting on their
     last victim.

     The credits crawl up.

     Just as the credits end...

     the engine of the helicopter sputters...

     and dies.
