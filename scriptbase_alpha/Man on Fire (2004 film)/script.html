"Man On Fire"

<b>OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE
</b>
<b>EXT.   MEXICO CITY - DAY
</b>
High over the city on a bright Sunday morning, the sun
pounding its way through the orange haze of smog. As we
descend toward the clots of traffic blocking the streets:
the sounds of a Mass being sung.

<b>A CATHOLIC CHURCH
</b>
The big wooden doors open to release the parishioners
inside. Feature a tall, lanky 18-YEAR-OLD. Holding his
GIRLFRIEND'S hand, anxious for Sunday to really begin.
They don't notice the traffic suddenly thin, like a
faucet's been cranked down. They move toward a Mercedes
500. As a CHAUFFEUR holds the back door open for them...

<b>A GRAND MARQUIS
</b>
Squeals around the corner, lurches to a stop alongside
the Mercedes. FOUR MEN get out flashing  badges. In a
moment they're hustling Eighteen toward the car, stiff-
arming the chauffeur. As the girlfriend  cries and the
gossip among the parishioners begins...

The Grand Marquis pulls away.

<b>INT.   GRAND MARQUIS - DAY
</b>
They shove eighteen down to the floor of the backseat.
These guys are not the police.

A switchblade is flicked open. Practiced hands slit the
boy's Sunday suit from the base of his neck to his heels.
Eighteen yelps as the blade draws blood across one calf.

Duct tape is wrapped around his hands, eyes, and head.

<b>EXT.   WOODED AREA - DAY
</b>
The Marquis is parked across from another CAR. FOUR NEW
GUYS wait as Eighteen is hauled out of the Marquis. His
clothes drop away like a snake shedding its skin. He
stands naked, bound and blind. Eighteen is handed over
from one group to the other.

<b>INT. TELEPHONE - UPSCALE HOME - MEXICO CITY - DAY
</b>
The phone rings. A bomb going off. Eighteen's
distraught FATHER (family photos of the boy on the wall)
answers.
<b>
</b>Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    2.


REVERSE TO REVEAL a battery of POLICE and NEGOTIATORS in
the room with him. One of them listens in, waves fingers
at him as the negotiations begin.

<b>INT.   VIDEO SURVEILLANCE OF AN 8' X 4' CELL - DAY
</b>
A wall smeared with God-knows-what. Facing   it, Eighteen
stands naked blindfolded and shivering. The   back of his
leg still bleeds. He shifts nervously as a   little JACK
RUSSELL TERRIER eagerly licks the blood off  his calf.

A MAN ('The Dreamer'), we don't see his face, negotiates
by cell phone. Voice calm. As he runs numbers, he slaps
his thigh. Jack Russell trots over, gets an ear
scratched.

At a motion from the man, Eighteen is taken down to the
ground. Straddled by two men, his head is mummified in
tape leaving one ear exposed.

CUT TO T.V. - Rosanna Garcia Guerrero, editor of REFORMA
newspaper, being interviewed, "...organized crime
syndicates...growth of kidnapping in Mexico over the last
two years."

<b>EXT.   UPSCALE HOUSE - DAY
</b>
As a hand removes a ziplock baggie from the mailbox. A
glimpse of something we don't want to see. An ear
partially obscured by sweating plastic and a blood smear.

<b>EXT.   CITY SQUARE - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT
</b>
A MERCEDES driving around the square, Eighteen's father
waving a white shirt out the window like a surrender
flag.

<b>EXT.   BRIDGE - NIGHT (3 AM)
</b>
Footbridge over railway sandwiched between freeway.
Empty train blazes through. Dangerous, deserted downtown
neighborhood. Looks more like "war torn Beirut", burnt
out cars and trash. The 18 year old's father, naked to
the waist, walks from the family Mercedes over the
footbridge carrying a pillowcase full of cash to a semi-
derelict car on the opposite side with a white piece of
fabric taped in the rear windshield and trunk open. He
slams the pillow case in the trunk and leaves.

<b>EXT.   DOWNTOWN MEXICO CITY - TWILIGHT
</b>
RUSH HOUR. A red stream of headlights separated from a
white stream of taillights by a narrow median.
<b>
</b>Work in Progress 2/10/03                                        3.


HORNS blare as a CAR stops. Eighteen, still blindfolded,
is dumped on the median. The car pulls away.

He stands there in the whirlwind. Pathetically SCREAMING
for help. More horns, shouts, no help.

END MAIN TITLES.   Goes to black.

<b>                          CREASY'S VOICE
</b>             Ezekiel 25:17 Blessed is he who in the
             name of charity and good will shepherds
             the weak through the valley of darkness
             for he is truly his brother's keeper and
             the finder of lost children.

<b>                                                 DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>INT.   AGO'S - MEXICO CITY - DAY
</b>
Samuel Valencia Ramos and his lawyer Jordan Kalfus in the
privacy of an alcove table. Jordan is well heeled, well
connected and well oiled. In that order. Samuel, at 40,
already has the patrician look that has served the male
members of his family for generations. They discuss the
kidnapping, a headline on the paper Jordan tosses aside.

<b>                          JORDAN
</b>             The family paid the ransom and he was
             returned two days later.
                    (laughs; chews)
             His father still hasn't gotten up the
             nerve to ask him if they fucked him up
             the ass.

<b>                          SAMUEL
</b>             And now every mother with money in Mexico
             City wants bigger and better bodyguards.
             My own wife included.

<b>                          JORDAN
</b>             If she pisses you off, you get another one.

<b>                          SAMUEL
</b>                    (laughs grimly)
             Do you know what she told me last night?

<b>                                                 FLASH TO:
</b>
<b>INT.   SITTING ROOM - RAMOS VILLA - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT
</b>
Samuel sits at his baby    grand piano playing a gentle
rendering of 'Delibes'.     His American wife LISA stands
away from him. Just the     sight of her back reveals a
pitch perfect petulance.    She tells him:
<b>
</b>Work in Progress 2/10/03                                       4.


<b>                          LISA
</b>             A man's worth can be judged by what he
             has or what he owes. Only the amount
             matters.

<b>                          SAMUEL
</b>             And bankruptcy. Where will that put me
             in the social strata?

<b>                          LISA
</b>             I'm only asking for one thing. And it's
             not an extravagance. It's not even for
             me; it's for our daughter.

<b>                             SAMUEL
</b>             Our daughter.

She turns at that: a woman so beautiful it nearly hurts
to look at her. She stares, plays him like Chinese
Checkers.

<b>                          LISA
</b>             Our child's safety is at stake.

<b>                          SAMUEL
</b>                    (stops playing)
             These people are professionals. They
             don't waste their time taking children
             whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.

<b>                          LISA
</b>             Samuel, it is not something we should
             skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the
             car or outside the school was at least
             some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I
             feel totally exposed.

She just stares at him.    He melts.

<b>                                                  RETURN TO:
</b>
<b>INT.   AGO'S - MEXICO CITY - DAY
</b>
Jordan smiles at his client, enjoys seeing him squirm.

<b>                          SAMUEL
</b>             Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be
             as beautiful as her mother one day.

<b>                           JORDAN
</b>             Yeah?   And if she was ugly?

Samuel rolls his eyes. Jordan laughs.       Beheading two
cigars, he passes one to Samuel.
<b>
</b>Work in Progress 2/10/03                                5.


<b>                         JORDAN
</b>            All my clients have kidnap and ransom
            insurance.

<b>                         SAMUEL
</b>            I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and
            my family and when it runs out in sixty
            days, without a bodyguard, I will not be
            able to renew it.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>            I know you need to please Lisa. An ass
            like that is hard to find. Good
            bodyguards are even harder.

<b>                         SAMUEL
</b>                   (interrupts)
            I know! I just had to let one go because
            I couldn't afford him!

Jordan lights his cigar.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>            You need a bodyguard of some description.
            It's a dangerous world we live in. But
            you will get what you pay for. He
            doesn't need to be Superman, does he?
            Can you go fifteen grand?

<b>                           SAMUEL
</b>            For a year?

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>            For a few months. Hire someone cheap.
            You have to have a bodyguard to keep the
            insurance. Then fire him for
            incompetence. The important thing is
            Lisa's daughter will return to school.

Samuel finally follows the logic.

<b>                         SAMUEL
</b>            And Lisa will be able to save face.    We
            won't be the only family without a
            bodyguard.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>            Her beauty fucks with your mind.

<b>                         SAMUEL
</b>            For an American she understands this
            country very well.
<b>
</b>Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   6.


<b>                           JORDAN
</b>              She understands men.

As Samuel puffs his cigar in satisfaction...

<b>EXT.    CORRIDOR - MEXICO CITY AIRPORT - DAY
</b>
As a 747 is towed by in the background, a MAN strides at
us. CREASY. Even in movement, he has a stillness, an
air of isolation. He's set apart from other living
things.

He wears dark sunglasses, carries a well-worn leather
bag. Inscrutable. Disconnected. A bit frightening.
The discipline of a soldier. The independence of a
gunslinger.

Automatic baggage teller (Red Light, Green Light).
Creasy feeds the machine with his perforated customs
card. Light flashes RED.

<b>CUSTOMS MAN

And then, somehow, Creasy is aware of being watched.        His
eyes flicker over, just in time to see...

<b>PINTA
</b>
Crouched low. In the doorway. She stares back at him a
beat, then disappears around the corner.

Creasy frowns.    Lisa steps over with Creasy's drink.

<b>                            CREASY
</b>               Thank you.

She makes a point of looking into his eyes. Creasy looks
back into hers with complete indifference, something she
has not experienced even from dying men.

She abruptly turns away.    Confused for a moment.
Finally:

<b>                            LISA
</b>               Pinta!

A few moments and Pinta arrives.       'Cool Hand Pinta'.

<b>                            LISA
</b>               This is Mr. Creasy.

Pinta walks over and very formally holds out her hand.
Creasy shakes it. An odd beat.

<b>                            LISA
</b>               Pinta, show him to his room.

Samuel reacts.    Creasy got the job.

</b>               This way, Mr. Creasy.

What an actress. As he follows her out.        Samuel sits at
his baby grand and begins to play.

<b>                            LISA

Samuel is stopped short by that one.    She steps over and
kisses her husband on the cheek.

Pinta leads the way. All enthusiasm, away from her
parents. A 150 pound black German Shepherd greets them.

Creasy follows her.   Frank pads along after them.

Not like downstairs, but comfortable enough.

</b>            We fixed the room up two weeks ago.       Mom

Creasy takes a stroll around it, ignoring her.

CAW! Creasy looks over at a CAGE on a stand holding a
MACAW. It tilts its head at the big man.

A TV and VHS machine in the corner.

<b>                            PINTA
</b>               That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him

               in the morning and picked me up in the

Finally Creasy turns, looks at her hard.

<b>                            CREASY
</b>               I'm here for you?

Pinta smiles huge, nods.

</b>               In between you can take Mom shopping and

<b>                            PINTA
</b>               Looks like he approves of you.

And then, walking on air, she's out the door.

Creasy sets up his room with meticulous precision that
comes from years in the military. Front and center he
arranges his shrine: an almost empty bottle of scotch and
a glass (engraved from an earlier encounter) next to a
pack of Marlboros and his weathered Zippo. Then, his
beaten up gun and holster. A well-travelled New
Testament is placed in the drawer.

He reaches in between the shirts, pulls out a fresh
bottle of scotch. He breaks the seal, unscrews the cap.

He pours a double... triple... wait, what do you call a
full glass of scotch?

CAW!   The macaw squawks it's disapproval.

He ejects the shell from the breach of the 9mm, tries to
catch it on the back of his hand. An old game with
himself.

His hand is too shaky. The bullet bounces off, hits the
floor. Creasy picks it up. Ejecting the magazine, he
starts to oil the weapon.

CAW! As the macaw squawks, Creasy looks up. It doesn't
feel like this relationship is going to work.

In his room. Tests his mag spring with his thumb, begins
loading up. The full magazine joins with those already
loaded.

Another glass of scotch is poured.

Creasy's hands oil the holster. The Sig Sauer is slipped
in. The holster is hung over the corner post of the bed.

A map is flattened. Creasy's finger traces various
routes, pencils them in. From the house to Pinta's
school.

The macaw squawks again. Creasy steps over, takes the
cage and carries it to the open window. He opens the
cage door.

Creasy's drinking in the dark next to the window,
listening to the sounds of Mexico City at night.

The empty scotch glass is set down.    Ominously sober.

Brushing her hair, Pinta wanders to the window at the
sound of a car hood closing. Creasy is down below going
over the car; a dark BLUE MERCEDES. As he checks
underneath...

The "Car Wash Guy", Pedro, trying to engage Creasy.
Frank looks on, seems like he disapproves of Pedro.

<b>INT.   MERCEDES - DAY

Creasy sits grimly behind the wheel. Pinta exuberant
beside him. Traveling route number one from home base to

back of the right one is swirled with scars.

<b>                          PINTA

TOYOTA COROLLA pulls out behind him.

Creasy drives in toward a rambling,  ivy-clad building set

Creasy slams a Jack and Coke.

Creasy striding, the frivolous shoppers like another
species as he moves through them. Might as well wear a
shark fin. He spots something: a MUSIC STORE.

<b>INT.   MUSIC STORE - MEXICO CITY - DAY
</b>
Creasy finds the section he's looking for, searches a
rack. There. As he pulls a particular CD, we are not
privy to what it is.

<b>EXT.   COURTYARD - PINTA'S SCHOOL - DAY
</b>
Creasy waits, smoking a Marlboro light, separate from the
other drivers and bodyguards. The bodyguards stand
together sharing cigarettes and stories. Give him a
share of unfriendly looks. Creasy could care less.

The doors open and the children pour out. PINTA exits, a
huge grin as she spots Creasy. Creasy palms the
Marlboro. The frown on his might as well be chiseled in
marble.

<b>INT.   MERCEDES - ROLLING -DAY
</b>
Pinta rides shotgun alongside Creasy.     She looks out the
window, realizes...

<b>                             CREASY
</b>             That's right.

</b>             I understand.     Smart.

No answer from Creasy.     It's hard not to feel foolish
around this kid.

</b>              Oh...

Pinta watches Creasy a moment, trying to figure a way in.
She looks at his scarred right hand on the wheel.

Then, as she reaches out...

<b>                           PINTA

And touches it.

<b>                              PINTA

Creasy gives her a look, devoid of humanity for an
instant.

<b>                           CREASY
</b>              No more questions.

When he speaks again he's colder; he's decided something.

They drive on in silence. Creasy finally glances over.
Pinta stares straight ahead, her chin quivering.

Creasy shoulders open his door, bolts out.

<b>INTERSECTION
</b>
Creasy has barely straightened himself and Pinta is
already getting back in the car. This time in the
backseat.

Creasy sighs. The light goes green.     Scooters whine away
and horns blare.

Creasy sits back behind the wheel.

Creasy looks back at her, but she stares straight ahead.
As the chorus of horns continues, Creasy continues driving.

<b>INT.   KITCHEN - RAMOS VILLA - DAY
</b>
Creasy sits at the table   with the old gardener GOMEZ
(we've seen him trimming   hedges and such in earlier
exteriors). Gomez's just    cleaned his plate and is going
after any remnants with a   crust of bread. Creasy hasn't
touched his.

MARIA, the cook, enters.    As she clocks Creasy's plate...

<b>INT.   CREASY'S ROOM - SUNSET
</b>
'Chopin' drifts across the courtyard. Samuel is a very
accomplished player.

Creasy sits in a chair in the twilight by the window, a
glass of scotch in his hand. A knock at the door.

            you for a moment?

He shakes his head. Lisa glides into the room like a
dancer, sits down at the foot of the bed.

A beat and then Lisa nods.

             confident you'll do that.

Lisa stands, is about to start out when she sees his gun
and holster hanging from the corner of the bed. It gives
her pause. Something sexy about it and Creasy's
proximity.

<b>                          LISA
</b>             I didn't realize you had a gun.    I know

Creasy doesn't answer, just watches her.

</b>             Please, it's Lisa... I'll be coming with

Finally, Lisa just shrugs and disappears out the door.
Creasy slugs down a gulp of scotch.

<b>INT.   PINTA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Pinta, blankets up, teddy bear beside her, says her
prayer.

</b>             Give me God what you still have.    Give me

Then, she listens as Linda Ronstadt's "Blue Bayou" starts
to drift through the open window, down from the room
above.

He stands in the dark, in front of the glow of the
stereo. The empty bag from the record store. This is
the CD he bought. As the song ends, Creasy hits the back-
up button. "Blue Bayou" begins again. Creasy takes the
9mm from its holster. As he sits back in his chair...

Pinta listens to the music, figures a way to dance to it.

</b>
Creasy sits in the dark with his 'Blue Bayou'. Creasy
does not look right. Holding the 9mm, he ejects the
round, tries to catch it on the back of his hand. No
good.

He chambers another round.     Tries again.   Nope.

Pinta still dancing, finding a way to be with Creasy
whether he knows it or not. Frank, the dog, watches her
every move, perplexed.

<b>INT.   CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
As the song repeats, Creasy chambers yet another round.
Feels like he misses a beat as he loads one shell into
the chamber. Pinta sings along oblivious. Suddenly the
barrel is at his forehead and the trigger has been
pulled. No gun shot. A click. Hammer against shell.
Creasy is confused. He ejects the shell and catches it
in the palm of his hand. Macro photograph / a small dimple
on the back of the shell is the only evidence of his
actions. Pinta still dances.

Rayburn in bed with his beautiful 19-year-old Mexican

As she leans down to kiss her son, a cellphone rings.
Rayburn looks over at the nightstand. FIVE CELLPHONES

it.

There she is. Pinta. Standing in the window of her

a look at him.

paper from his pocket. But nothing to write with.

Her little hand comes over the top of the seat with a
pencil. Creasy takes it, slows to let the Corolla catch
up. He squints into the mirror to read the plate.

shoulder...

Pinta gets out with book bag and her      towel. As she

</b>             Jordan, thank you for the lovely lunch.
             I promise not to let Evelyn spend too
             much.

Evelyn doesn't see it, but Creasy does. Jordan just lets
his fingers trace the top of Lisa's ass.

As she and Evelyn head for the car, Creasy is there to
open the door.

</b>
Creasy gets behind the wheel. Pulls into traffic. As he
goes, he checks the rear view mirror. Jordan remains
standing on the curb watching the car pull away.
Something odd about it all.

<b>EXT.   PUBLIC POOL - MEXICO CITY - DAY
</b>
Loud. Chaotic. Reminiscent     of a lunatic asylum. Creasy
arrives at the public pool.    A practice. Several
bodyguards gather at one end   of the pool. Give Creasy a
less than friendly look. As    he looks for Pinta...

A GUN goes off.

Sees: The smoke from the starting pistol as the SWIMMERS
splash into the water.

He sees Pinta in the pool. The fifty yard dash. She's
in fifth. Then fourth. Creasy walks along beside her.
Third. Second and closing. And at the wall, still
second.

She surfaces, frustrated.    As she sees Creasy there...

Creasy drives. Pinta in back, writing in her notebook.
Not speaking, but a weird sort of harmony. Finally.

</b>             You're fast.

             off. By the time I catch up, it's too
             late.

She keeps writing.   The number "2" over and over.

<b>INT.   CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Creasy sits in his chair drinking scotch.     All alone
needless to say.

Creasy takes the instructional VHS on bodyguards that
Rayburn gave him and plugs it into the VCR. It's in
Japanese. Shakes his head. He switches off the VCR and
surfs the TV channels instead. Sees talk show with the
editor of REFORMA newspaper, ROSANNA GUERRERO, talking
about organized crime in Mexico.

From out the window, a CAW, then again.     Yet again.

Finally, Creasy stands goes to the window. He leans out,
sees Pinta's window across the lawn from him.

Pinta standing on the terrace. Another CAW.

Creasy decides to play.    He CAWS in return.

Pinta looks around.    Creasy does a pretty good
impersonation.

Hears Pinta CAW again.

<b>                          CREASY
</b>             Hey... Pinta...

She looks up at him.

<b>                           CREASY
</b>             Yes.   Actually, he was driving me crazy.

Creasy disappears back inside. Pinta smiles big before
letting the stick drop to the ground.

<b>                          PINTA
</b>             I got you to talk, Creasy bear.

Blue Bayou plays.   Pinta now listens to Creasy's sound.

A DRIVER gets Samuel's and Lisa's luggage into a car.
They're on their way, kissing Pinta goodbye.

Lisa gives her a look. Don't make this harder than it has
to be. Finally, Pinta nods.

Creasy waits quite a discreet distance away by the
Mercedes. She steps over, stops to wave goodbye one last
time, then gets in back. As Creasy shuts the door.

<b>INT.   MERCEDES - MEXICO CITY ROAD - DAY
</b>
Creasy drives, glances in the mirror at Pinta in the back
seat. She wipes away a tear just as it forms.

<b>                          CREASY
</b>             They'll be back in a week.

<b>                          PINTA
</b>             They can stay for two weeks.   I don't
             care.

She's got a toughness Creasy likes.   As she looks out the
window, he looks ahead.

Creasy eats.

</b>               The food is excellent, Maria.     You have a

Maria beams with pleasure.

<b>                            MARIA
</b>               My pleasure, Creasy.

Pinta enters  in a RED SATIN DEVIL'S OUTFIT. She looks a
bit forlorn  as she sits at opposite ends of the table
from Creasy.   As she stares at her plate, Creasy starts
to laugh at  what an odd sight she is. All dressed up and
no place to  go.

Wrong move. Pinta stands, marches out of the room.        As
Maria and Creasy exchange a look...

<b>EXT./INT.   WINDOW - RAMOS VILLA - DAY
</b>
Pinta the devil stares sadly out here window. Then there
it is! The macaw. Sitting on the opposite roof.

<b>EXT.   ATTIC WINDOW - RAMOS VILLA - DAY
</b>
Pinta pushes it open, climbs out onto the slope of the
roof. This doesn't look like such a good idea. As she
crosses, disappears over the peak.

It's a game of catch me if you can. 'Bird' looks at
Pinta right in the eye. She gingerly moves closer. The
bird moves away, just out of her reach each time.

<b>CHIMNEY
</b>
Pinta coming down the other slope.      There's the macaw.

<b>                             PINTA

The fourth time Pinta's fingers are centimeters away.
She reaches and suddenly slides along the slick tile
covering this section of the roof. Frank's in the yard
barking loudly.

Near the edge, she manages to stop.      Whew!

She scrambles up a few feet. A tile snaps off. She
slides again. This time right off the edge.

She catches the rain gutter. Hangs thirty feet above the
ground. A concrete landing below. As the gutter creaks:

<b>                           PINTA'S VOICE

Creasy is on his feet, out the door in a heartbeat.

<b>EXT.   SIDE YARD - DAY
</b>
Creasy dashes around just as the gutter drops on one
side. Pinta drops ten feet, jerks to a stop as the
gutter stops, then drops the last twenty feet...

...landing in a hedge.   Creasy dashes over.

<b>                           CREASY
</b>             Pinta!

She's in a lot of pain, but moving her arms and head.
Frank's licking her face.

carefully probes with his fingers. She winces.

Pinta nods. Creasy eases his arms under, around her,
lifts her out as gently as possible. She disappears in
his arms.

foot fall. Begins to cross herself.

<b>                            CREASY
</b>             It's okay.    She's just scared.

Creasy cradles her, pats her back.      As Pinta says his
name like a mantra...

<b>                          CREASY
</b>             A man asked me questions once.   He smoked
             a lot. There was no ashtray.

That's it. End of explanation. Creasy continues
watching the road. Pinta watches him.

<b>                          CREASY
</b>             Remember you asked me what state I was
             from?

<b>                            PINTA
</b>             Yes.

<b>                          CREASY
</b>             Where you're from isn't so much about
             geography; it's about events. Where
             you're from is what happened to you.

             I guess that really does make me a hard

As the two of them share a LAUGH...

knock, she sees the door is ajar, hears voices. She
peeks in.

Creasy and Pinta sit on the floor, pencils, papers and a
book spread out before them. Doing her history homework.

<b>LISA'S POV - OF CREASY
</b>
He's charming and great with Pinta.     And sexy... Evelyn
was right.

<b>                          PINTA

<b>                           CREASY
</b>             Yeah.   Two or three.

Lisa continues to watch the little play. She smiles,
knocks on the door as she opens it. Pinta and Creasy
both look back over their shoulders.

<b>                          LISA
</b>             Creasy, tomorrow, after you drop off
             Pinta, could you come back to take me to
             get my hair done?

Creasy nods. They both continue to look at her.      She
gets the feeling she's interrupting.

<b>                          LISA
</b>             Alright, I'll leave you two to your

As she goes...

<b>EXT.   HAIRDRESSERS - ZONA ROSA - DAY
</b>
Mexico City traffic is heavy. Cars and people. Creasy
stands by the car across the street. Cooling his heels.
He can just catch a glimpse of Lisa in the shop.

Suddenly the traffic seems to finish, expending itself.
The street goes ominously quiet. Creasy's antennae go
up.

A police car comes prowling down the empty street.
Creasy makes eye contact with the guys up front.

Then, Creasy spots a BUSINESSMAN coming out of a doorway
with a BODYGUARD attached. The bodyguard is speaking
into a two-way radio.
<b>

Creasy's sixth sense tweaks as a Mercedes 500 pulls up to
collect the businessman.

And the cop car disappears around the corner even as TWO
MEN start toward the businessman.

Lisa exits the hairdresser's.    Looks stunning.

Creasy starts across the street toward her.

A second car squeals around the corner behind the
Mercedes and everything goes to Hell.

GUNFIRE erupts.

And then Creasy is there.

His arm around Lisa's waist, sweeping her off her feet.
The next thing she knows she flattened on the ground in a
shop doorway, Creasy on top of her. Shielding her.

The bodyguard beside the businessman is killed. The body
guard in the Mercedes trades a full magazine before he's
shot.

A PEDESTRIAN is killed.

Liza screams as the glass above and behind them shatters.

The businessman is hustled into the back of the second
car.

Lisa sees the gun in Creasy's hands.

She hears the slamming of the car door, the screeching of
tires. A parked VAN also hauling ass out of there. But
then she's aware of something else.

Creasy on top of her.   She feels his weight, his heat...

<b>                            CREASY
</b>             Don't move.

She watches as he rises, goes to the curb. One bodyguard
is sprawled dead across the ground. Red blood on the
sidewalk. As Lisa closes her eyes.

<b>INT.   MERCEDES - STREET - DAY

Lisa sits in the backseat. Through the window we can see
Creasy wrap up his statement to a member of the JUDICIAL
POLICE. Finally he gets in the car, starts to drive.

</b>             Murdering people in the street... You
             had your gun, why didn't you shoot them?

The shoulders in front of her just shrug.

<b>                          CREASY
</b>             Nothing to do with me. Or you. Besides,
             there was another one in the passenger
             side of the van with a sawed-off shotgun.
             If I'd started shooting his friends, he
             would've had me. And you.

Quiet a beat. Lisa pulls a sliver of glass from her
hair, looks from it to Creasy.

</b>             A minimum close protection team consists

             situation, you need two guards plus a

She shakes involuntarily. It's hitting her.      As they
make eye contact through the mirror...

The Mercedes parked. Creasy and Lisa up against it.
Fucking. No cultured way to put it. Like animals. A
primal release for both of them.

Pinta waiting alone. Creasy's late. Then the gate
swings back; the Mercedes drives through. Smiling, she
hurries over, hops in the passenger seat.

</b>             You were never late before, I was

Creasy doesn't answer.    He actually looks guilty.   Pinta
watches him a moment.

Creasy doesn't answer, just grunts. Pinta keeps looking
at him and it suddenly all makes sense.

He looks over at her, starts to say something, then
thinks better of it. Finally...

<b>                          PINTA
</b>             Do you think my mother likes you?

She's for sure pissed. Definitely aware and definitely
jealous. Creasy's a bit amazed, not sure how to respond.

<b>                          CREASY
</b>             I think she's afraid of me.      But not the
             same way most people are.

Pinta considers this.   Then..

<b>                          PINTA
</b>             I'm not afraid you, Creasy.

<b>                          CREASY

<b>                          PINTA
</b>             Are you afraid of me?

Creasy looks at her, almost like he's deciding.

Pinta flinches at the sound. She opens her eyes, shrugs
an apology at him. Creasy frowns, shakes his head.
Pinta closes her eyes again. He starts walking around
her. Frank oversees the whole program.

             until you hear the sound.

Eyes closed, she's drifted off with his voice. And
Creasy WHACKS them together right in front of her face.

Pinta smiles at the sound.     Creasy smiles at the sight.

WHACK!   Pinta bolts from the blocks.    SPLASHES.

Pinta touches the far wall of the pool, the finish line.
Creasy checks his watch, claps.

</b>             Hi, Dad.

He gives her a pat on the head. Simultaneously, Samuel
fixes Creasy with a look, strides purposefully over. He
thrusts out his hand, shakes Creasy's.

</b>             I want to thank you, Creasy.   For what

to know exactly what she knows.

The Car Wash Guy, - Pedro, ingratiates himself with
Samuel.

Creasy looks at her, smiles to himself.   Pinta looks
back.

something, reaches down to pull a DANDELION from a crack
where the sidewalk meets the wall. She smiles at Creasy.

<b>                         PINTA

Creasy takes it from her. He's saved by the bell as a

open. Pinta heaves a resigned sigh.

Then, the sound of the teacher playing.   Pinta appears in

<b>THE STREET
</b>
Creasy leaning against the Mercedes. Traffic pounding
by. The dandelion is stuck in a button hole of his
shirt.

And then suddenly traffic thins out. Reminiscent of the
previous two kidnappings. It's a process. Creasy
straightens up.

A Judicial POLICE CAR cruises by, slowly. Creasy makes
eye contact with the two cops up front. The same guys
who were at Zona Rosa.

Creasy starts across the street toward the apartment
building. At the same time as...

The door bangs open. Pinta exiting. She spots Creasy, a
huge grin on her face. She was not accepted.

And a white TOYOTA COROLLA coming the other way.

The police car reverses back, cutting Creasy off from
Pinta. The COPS getting out, big smiles on their faces.

<b>THE COROLLA
</b>
Slides to a stop in front of Pinta, blocking her path to
Creasy. And as TWO MEN leap out from the backseat...

<b>                           CREASY
</b>                     (drawing his 9mm)

But she's rooted with fear.

And the men are almost on her.

Creasy raises the 9mm overhead.    BANG!

And the sound frees her.   Pinta runs!

Ducking under a flailing arm.    Quick and lithe.   Trying
to reach her bodyguard.

The cops drawing Uzi's..

Creasy plants himself, the Sig Sauer now level.     He fires
twice into COP ONE, dead center in the chest.

Pinta runs.   Chased by the TWO MEN.

COP TWO returns fire wildly: the Mercedes hit in a ten
bullet line.
<b>

Creasy fires two more rounds into COP TWO who's hit high
in the chest and throat. Precise.

Creasy pivots, strides calmly forward, firing at the men
chasing Pinta. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

MAN ONE goes down, hit in the ribs.

A bullet slams Creasy in the back, fired from inside the
Corolla.

Creasy fires back.    BOOM!    BOOM!

MAN THREE falls dead, hit just below his nose, just above
his teeth. The FAT DRIVER fires, now, and Creasy is hit
in the shoulder.

And Pinta disappears into the traffic.        Gone.

MAN TWO, who has abandoned chasing Pinta, fires again.

Creasy drops the 9mm as he is hit in the stomach.      He
falls to his knees.

The dandelion starts to come apart.      Drifting away, piece
by piece.

Slack-jawed, Creasy looks about. Sees the FAT DRIVER
heaving himself out of the Corolla while MAN TWO scans
for Pinta who's nowhere in sight.

She got away!   Creasy smiles even as he crumples over on
his side.

<b>                              PINTA'S VOICE
</b><b>            CREASY!

And Pinta is back. Running toward Creasy. She can't
leave him like this. She was safe and now she's back.

She runs to him, wraps her arms around him.

<b>                              PINTA

MAN TWO catches up, tears Pinta away, starts back for the
sedan. Creasy can only blink after them.

MAN TWO crams her in the back seat, follows. The fat
driver gets back in behind the wheel. As the door slams
shut, wheels spin, grip and the Corolla accelerates away.

We just see Pinta look back through the rear windshield.
An anguished image before she's pulled back down.

Creasy makes a wish.     Not for himself, but for her.

</b>             We're interested in the same thing.         I'm

Creasy walks away from her.     Rosanna catches up and holds
out a plastic ziploc.

<b>                          ROSANNA
</b>             This might interest you.       I found it
             across the street.

Creasy empties the contents of the ziplock into his hand.
A small ball of paper and the remains of a black candle.
Creasy unballs the paper. It's a photo.

He hands it back to her, not interested.    As he turns to
go.

<b>                            ROSANNA
</b>               What are you going to do?

Creasy doesn't answer.

<b>                            ROSANNA
</b>               I can help. I have a situation Mr.
               Creasy. There is a brotherhood called Le

               ranking Government officials, corrupt
               police, and organized crime at a level
               that is very difficult for me to touch.
               I believe you were a victim of this
               organization. You and this story may
               help to unmask them.

Creasy looks carefully at Rosanna.    Right now he trusts
no one.

<b>                            CREASY
</b>               Thank you.

He walks away towards Rayburn.

<b>EXT.   RAMOS HOUSE - DAWN
</b>
The SUV parked a discreet distance away. Rayburn grinds
out another cigarette, mutters to himself.

<b>INT.   CREASY'S ROOM - DAWN
</b>
Bruno lets him in. Nothings been touched.     Creasy
retrieves his bullet from his shrine along   with the
'Jack', Marlboros, and New Testament. Puts    his few
possessions in a bag. MOVE WITH him as he    silently
crosses out into the hall, heads toward...

<b>PINTA'S ROOM
</b>
He stands there a moment. His pain entirely his own.
And then he goes to Pinta's little desk, finds her school
notebook buried in a pile. He flips through it until he
finds...

The LICENSE PLATE NUMBER Pinta jotted for him. Then he
notices the notebook is really a diary. Every page
references her day to day relationship with Creasy. "I
love you Creasy Bear." He hears soft footsteps. Creasy
turns.

Lisa stands in the doorway in her nightgown, her eyes
drilling through Creasy.

<b>                            LISA

Creasy just blinks at her as the words blast through him.

<b>                            LISA

bearing cold comfort.

Lisa doesn't answer, but the connection between them is
suddenly monumental. Finally, Creasy looks away. He
picks up Pinta's battered, old TEDDY BEAR.

Creasy nods.    He will.    As he continues away...

Leaves blow across the surface of the water. Underwater
slow motion, a wall turn. It looks remarkably like
Pinta.

"Blue Bayou" drifts through the air. Soft, in the ether
somewhere. Creasy hears it, half raises his head.

</b>             Why Blue Bayou, Creasy? Is that where

She's standing behind him. Wearing the all too familiar

The words are a salve, a balm.     He turns, looks back over
his shoulder. He's all alone.

<b>INT.   SUV - NEAR RAMOS - MEXICO CITY - DAWN

Rayburn looks over his shoulder, sees Creasy walking down
the street. Clutching a teddy bear.

Creasy gets in the car.    Rayburn drives.

No answer.   Finally, as Rayburn lights a cigarette...

<b>                          CREASY
</b>             I'm going to need help, Ray.

Rayburn grinds out the cigarette he just lit, knows what
just was asked. Creasy needs help unleashing a plague.

written list. Rayburn reads, his eyes widening.

The surface breaks as Creasy enters the water     wearing a
red T-shirt to hide the bandages. He begins      a slow
laborious stroke.  A pale attempt at getting     back into
shape. A ribbon of  maroon trails him through     the water.

Next he's looking at grenades.   He hefts two different
choices.

Rosanna pauses.

<b>                          ROSANNA
</b>             Because he's outside. Because he's not

</b>             We did voice analysis of the last five

<b>                          ROSANNA
</b>             Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is

Jorge exits the building still trying to get the last
button of his police uniform closed. He's a cop. He
struggles to get behind the wheel of the Fiat. The car
is tiny.

Someone's getting in on the passenger side.

As Jorge starts to protest, Creasy rams a Sig into his

Still in the driver's seat, Jorge wakes. The first thing
he sees is that his hands are taped to the steering wheel
with his pudgy white fingers exposed. He is naked,
reminiscent of the 18 year old in the opening sequence.

Creasy opens Pinta's notebook to a blank page near the
end. He clicks open a pen.

Creasy presses in the car's cigarette lighter.

Then he opens a buck knife.    Jorge winces at the sound of
the blade locking.

Without warning Creasy reaches up with the buck knife, a
flash of steel.

The big man howls, his left ear suddenly missing, starts
an epic struggle, practically breaking the wheel off the
steering column. He is like a bucking Rhinoceros.

He howls as Creasy sprays his face with pepper spray.

Some of the pepper spray has gotten in his face as well.

Creasy wipes his tearing eyes. And then he turns.

mimes a  pistol action with his forefinger and thumb. He
opens it  to find himself staring square into the eyes of

Creasy clubs him again in the head.

Frightened footsteps running on the other side of a

Seen through a two-way mirror.   Manzano watches as...

Rayburn sits at a steel chair, bolted to the floor.
Rayburn's eyes are closed. In meditation. Then, slowly,
his arms extend out to the sides. Manzano is curious as,
slower still, Rayburn extends both hands out in front of
him, palms up. Must be a Zen thing.

Then, both MIDDLE FINGERS are extended. With eyes still
closed, Rayburn mouths 'fuck you'. Manzano bursts a
laugh.

The old man watches as Creasy opens he canvas bag, pulls
out two metal tubes that he screws together. It's a

proof. The lit   Molotov explodes beneath the car.
Silence. Then a   dull impact explosion. 30 feet of
flames envelope  the car. The driver and Tazinari both
prisoners inside  their own car.

The driver exits releasing a full clip from his Uzi.
Creasy nails him with a single shot to the head.

from his stomach envelopes his whole body.

<b>INT.   DINING ROOM - EVENING
</b>
Samuel eats dinner silently. Lisa just stares into
space, nursing a vodka. Even great marriages cannot
survive the trauma of kidnapping and subsequent death.

The door opens and they expect to see Maria with the
deserts. Creasy enters and sits at the table like a
dinner guest.

<b>                          CREASY

             I'm going to talk to your wife. If you
             move or say one word, I'll kill you.

He takes a Colt Officer model .45 semi-automatic pistol
out of his waistband and lays it on the table in
preparation for something, we don't know what. He turns
to Lisa.

<b>                          CREASY
</b>             I'm going to tell you a story. Your
             lawyer is dead. Someone didn't want him
             talking. Last week he wired $2.5 million
             into his U.S. bank account. Colonel
             Ernesto Tazinari is also dead. He
             hijacked the ransom drop, another $2.5
             million. If my arithmetic is correct it
             means $5 million remains.

Creasy looks to Samuel.

            sure he thought she'd sit there for three
            days eating pizza and watching TV. It
            didn't work out that way. Everything got
            fucked up when I killed the cops and
            Tazinari saw an opportunity.

Lisa screams.   Creasy gestures with a finger to his lips.

</b>            On the surface it was low risk and high
            return. This was the third autosequestra
            Jordan had organized for clients. The
            other two succeeded.

Samuel looks to Lisa.

<b>                          SAMUEL
</b>            Our lifestyle was in jeopardy. My pain
            and weakness only fueled your anger and
            determination. I wasn't sure about

            Then I woke up one day and it was done.
                   (beat)
            Jordan was supposed to take care of it.

Through all of the above, Creasy removes the special
bullet held in the seam of his wallet. The misfire.     He
empties the other cartridges from his gun.

Lisa suddenly attacks Samuel in a violent, emotional
outburst of tears, screaming, and rage. Drawing blood
from his nose and upper lip. Samuel smothers Lisa's arms
beneath his. He appears strong and decisive for the
first time.

Creasy very carefully takes the bullet, puts it into the
magazine and chambers the round. He looks into Samuel's
eyes.

<b>                         CREASY
</b>            A bullet does not lie. A bullet tells
            the truth. And the truth will set you
            free.

Creasy hands Samuel the gun.

<b>                         CREASY
</b>            In many ways I think this bullet should
            be shared between you and Lisa.

             the front seat with him. I    wish he would

Creasy looks up from the notebook and out at the city.
And a smile comes. But it's bitter and hopeless.

It's half grief, half not knowing where to go next, what
to do. And he's dying. He knows that too. Creasy dials

over speakers.

There's a newspaper folded on   his dais, more photos of

him down a row of empty  booths. Creasy    slows, stops as
he sees the only person  waiting for him   is Manzano. As
Manzano smiles.

Creasy doesn't respond. Finally Manzano gives him the

Creasy checks the digital "8x10" even though this face is
indelibly imprinted on his brain.

It's not "The Dreamer."    Not as handsome, but there's a
resemblance.

The MAN unlocks the front door, checks the street first
and then enters.

Creasy regroups mentally and physically. Checks the
magazine in his SIG SAUER. Chambers rounds into his
shotgun. Looks up and sees a six-year-old on a bicycle
approach the front door. A ten-year-old opens the door
from inside. The six-year-old struggles to get his
bicycle through the doorway.

Creasy moves. He holds the shotgun against his leg as he
strides across the street. "Man on Fire."

The bicycle makes it in.    And the door is closing...

Creasy gets a foot in, forces his way inside.

<b>MANZANO'S OFFICE - AFI HQ
</b>
Manzano listens to a radio over a desk speaker.

<b>INT.   HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
The pregnant woman, Reina Rosas, SCREAMING BLOODY MURDER
as Creasy fills the space behind her. Creasy follows as
she runs.

<b>LIVING ROOM
</b>
Creasy faces Reina, heavily pregnant. Silence. Two
other kids hide behind her. Suddenly the wall next to
Creasy explodes in a hail of bullets.

We realize Creasy caught one round in the chest. He's
down on one knee... uses the shotgun as a crutch. Reina
is screaming.

Hear a door torn open. Creasy      moves to the sound.   A
MAN has run out the back...

<b>EXT. HOUSE - BACK COURTYARD
</b>
Creasy steps into courtyard, turns, a VW Bug coming right
at him...

Aims his weapon.

<b>THE MAN
</b>
Ducks down... windshield shatters from the blast of
Creasy's shotgun... Bug slams into wall. The Man rolls
out... using the door as a shield.

<b>BARRIO
</b>
The Man   flees into a labyrinth of packing-crate houses on
car-tire   foundations out into street. Running hard, too
hard for   Creasy in his condition. He is losing a lot of
blood.    He stops.

<b>CREASY
</b>
Behind the wheel of the Volkswagon, roars out chasing.

Now through the maze of poverty... Creasy drives hard...
no sign of the Man... empty eyes of poverty looking
back... mostly women and children... They clearly see
Creasy... fully exposed... driving a car with no
windshield... He slams the car into reverse.

Someone says "Creasy" aloud... now more faces to turn...
children looking directly through his absent windshield.

One skinny kid runs ahead of Creasy. The boy points at
one cardboard house propped up against a brick and stucco
wall.

<b>INT. VOLKSWAGON
</b>
Creasy pops the clutch... straight into a small house...
taking whole walls of cardboard... to the back brick
wall... The 'Man' is pinned violently between the car and
the wall.

Creasy, shotgun in one hand, the injured Man in the
other... walks through the barrio... a small crowd is
yelling, "Creasy, MAN ON FIRE" (in Spanish: Hombre en
Fuego).

<b>INT.   LIVING ROOM - REINA ROSAS HOUSE - DAY
</b>
The Man badly broken and bleeding lies on the floor, flex-
cuffed. Reina screams at Creasy. Creasy's popping
Percodan's. The hysteria is peaking. Creasy chambers a
round and shoots man through left knee. Screams then
silence.

<b>                            CREASY

<b>                          CREASY
</b>             How do you contact 'the Boss'?

Reina hesitates.

Creasy chambers another round and holds the gun to man's
right knee.

Daniel has a different attitude, a lot more amenable.     He
tries to speak to Creasy very logically about a very

DANIEL hangs up.

<b>INT. LIVING ROOM

Aurillio moans on the floor. Reina says the rosary. The

of speaking.

Time stands still for Creasy.        Words evaporate.    Liquid
film in Creasy's eyes.

CLOSE UP of Creasy's shocked face. He pulls down his
shirt collar. Bubbles of blood form and reform over his
chest wound as the maroon spreads across his chest and
stomach.

He disconnects.   He cannot waste his ebbing strength.

<b>EXT. BRIDGE OF THE AZTECS - SUNSET
</b>
Darkness has fallen. Few people are on the street as
Creasy pulls to the south end of the bridge. He parks...
looks around... it's deserted. She's not coming. Checks
his watch, turns and walks toward the bridge. The Ramos
Mercedes drives up the bridge. Headlights off. Lisa is
driving. She exits the car.

She runs to catch Creasy.

<b>                         LISA
</b>            Creasy... Wait.

<b>                         CREASY
</b>            Stay here. If you do something stupid,
            we won't get her back.

He climbs the steps of the bridge trying to maintain his
dignity through the pain. He can see cars parked on the
other side.

OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE - Creasy's POV

Creasy's dreamlike POV (Is it real or a dream) A
driver exits a shadowed car and opens the passenger door.
A SMALL FIGURE in a hooded sweat shirt and sweat pants
exits the car. Confused. Disoriented.

<b>CREST OF THE BRIDGE
</b><b>
</b>Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     124.


Creasy waits. Breathing labored breaths. He sees it all.

<b>OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE
</b>
The driver unties little hands. Removes a blindfold from
under the hood. He steps away. Offering no help.

The small figure is confused.

<b>CREST OF THE BRIDGE
</b>
Creasy calls out:

<b>                             CREASY
</b>               Pinta.   Pinta.

She turns and looks. It looks remarkably like her even
under the hooded sweatshirt. She begins to run. Across
the street, up the steps toward Creasy. A screaming
train flashes beneath. Car headlights illuminate the
bridge.

Time stands still and the 'city sounds' fade out to
nothing.

She runs up the remaining stairs and sprints across the
bridge. Her hood blows off revealing her full face.
It's definitely Pinta. Camera ramps as he jumps into
Creasy's arms. This is not the little girl we
experienced in the beginning of the movie. The
experience she just endured has been life changing. All
of a sudden we have a 40 year old head on an 8 year old
body.

She wraps herself around him. He picks her up.     We
glimpse a simple tear on his cheek. They talk.     But we
do not hear the words.

She notices her mom on the far side of the bridge.
Creasy maneuvers her toward Lisa.

Before she goes to her mother we hear:

<b>                            PINTA
</b>               I love you, Creasy... And you love me,
               right?

Creasy nods.    The inference is that he will see her in a
few minutes.

We start to hear Linda Ronstadt painfully, quietly on the
wind singing "Blue Bayou." He continues to walk across
to the opposite side of the bridge and gets into the
kidnappers' car.
<b>
</b>Work in Progress 2/10/03                                          125.


There's a certain sort of calm of him.
He closes the door, he lays his head against the back
window. He looks out at PINTA at the other side of the
bridge, where she's screams for Creasy. "Blue Bayou"
gets LOUDER. Pinta now knows it was a lie. Creasy is
not coming back. We're shooting through the glass of the
back window. We se Mexico City reflected in the glass.
As the car pulls out, time slows, and we see Creasy lay
his head back and close his eyes as the car descends down
into a dark tunnel.

Pinta can see Creasy's face, eyes slowly closing. He can
hear her screams before being enveloped by the night. As
"Blue Bayou" continues...

<b>EXT.    MEXICO CITY STREETS - DAY
</b>
Dark spot in the road. Suddenly Police lights, on the
roofs of four cars, flash simultaneously in front, in
blocking position. The driver turns and looks back
wanting to escape. He has a blacked out AFI armored van
right on his rear bumper. Nowhere to go.

SWAT at his door.    He's pulled and proned out onto the
road.

Manzano enters the driver's seat.       Reaching back to
Creasy. Grabs his hand.

<b>                           MANZANO
</b>              I'm your chauffeur now, Creasy.

Manzano does a U-turn.    Heading away.     On his portable
radio.

<b>                          MANZANO
</b>              All units. Commence the operation.

He reaches back again.

<b>                            MANZANO
</b>              Creasy?   Creasy?

CLOSE UP - Two hands clasp.

Creasy's left with Manzano's right. A strong grip.         Then
no response. Manzano pulls to the curb.

Manzano reaches Creasy's wrist.       Takes his pulse.
Creasy's gone.

Beat.
<b>
</b>Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     126.


Manzano kneels.   Still holding Creasy.   Unfolds Creasy's
fingers.

CLOSE UP - Pinta's medallion of St. Jude clutched in his
hand.

Manzano punches the seat again again and again.

<b>                           MANZANO
</b>            Goddamn you.

<b>EXT. GUARDIAN'S CAR - HIGH ANGLE U-TURN

            Hold at the perimeter.   Until I enter.

<b>EXT. DANIEL'S COMPOUND
</b>
Dark, suburban Cuernavaca street. Creasy's car rounds
the corner. Security outside the compound motions to
open the garage doors. The driver of the car is
faceless. Street light reflections across the
windshield.

The car enters the gates. A collection of armed bodies
appear in the courtyard curious to see this national
hero. "Hombre en Fuego."

The car stops. Nothing. This beat seems interminable.
A hand opens the rear door: His forehead explodes. The
driver door opens barely two shots, two more bodies drop.

Panic and confusion. Everybody runs for cover. An
overhead helicopter illuminates the mayhem in the
courtyard. An armored vehicle rams through the gates.

Manzano explodes out of the driver's door in slow motion.
He is clearly on a mission. He strides through the
mayhem, Creasy's Sig Sauer in one hand, and a .45 auto in
the other.

Manzano's guide to his destination is the 'The Dreamer's'
little Jack Russell running back to his master on
instinct.

Manzano moves purposefully. His surrounding environment
is Chaplinesque in its chaos. He enters a long walkway
to a patio, following the dog. Daniel Sanchez appears at
the end of the hall. We ramp him into slow motion. The
Mexican version of Gotti. He raises his arms, prepared
for the inevitable. The outcome is a given.
