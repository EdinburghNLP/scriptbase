    DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 11/2/96


    FADE IN:


1   INT. FLORIDA COURTROOM - DAY                                  1

    Northern Florida in the midst of a heat wave. Air
    conditioners fighting a losing battle. The gallery is
    full. The JUDGE a stern, old hand. The PROSECUTOR, an
    efficient man with a good case.

    The witness is BARBARA. She is maybe 13. She is a
    witness in a criminal trial. Her testimony has been
    carefully rehearsed.

                             BARBARA
               ... we go back to our homeroom for
               dismissal, unless you have a pass
               for sports or something.

                             PROSECUTOR (O.S.)
               And is that what you did on the
               day in question?

                            BARBARA
               No. Mr. Gettys asked me to stay
               after class.

                             PROSECUTOR
               What happened next, Barbara?

                             BARBARA
               Mr. Gettys closed the door.

                             PROSECUTOR
               Everyone else had gone?

                             BARBARA
               Yes. He told me to sit in the
               chair beside his desk.

    MR. GETTYS, the defendant, is 50. The very picture of
    respectability. His perfect wife and son staunchly
    enduring this testimony.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                              2.

                               PROSECUTOR
                 In your own words, Barbara, can
                 you tell us exactly what happened
                 during the next few minutes?

    KEVIN LOMAX.    Defense counsel.   Taking it all in.

                               BARBARA (O.S.)
                 I told him I was afraid I would
                 miss my bus. He promised I would
                 get to the bus on time if I would
                 help him to do something...

    Kevin -- his eyes -- drifting around the courtroom --
    taking inventory -- assessing damage --

                               BARBARA (O.S.)
                 ... Then he put -- before I could
                 say anything -- he placed his hand
                 inside my blouse...

    Kevin -- checking the jury and --

                               BARBARA (O.S.)
                 ... I was so frightened I didn't
                 move. I thought if I was just
                 quiet it would be okay...

    Kevin -- checking Gettys -- seeing something that stops
    him cold --

                               BARBARA (O.S.)
                 ... Then his other hand went up
                 under -- inside my skirt...

    Gettys' hand -- down below the table -- down where no one
    but Kevin could possibly see it -- Getty's fingers subtly
    feeling their way along the leg of his chair --

                               BARBARA (O.S.)
                 ... his hand then, it started, he
                 started, moving back and forth --
                 farther and farther inside my
                 skirt...

    Kevin -- glancing around -- nobody else can see it --

                               BARBARA (O.S.)
                 ... he said he was testing to see
                 if I had any special feelings,
                 that he wanted to find out what
                 kind of feelings I had...

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                              3.

1   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               1

    Gettys' hand -- excited now -- stroking the chair leg --
    absently -- involuntarily -- unmistakably sexual --

                               BARBARA (O.S.)
                 ... I didn't know what to say, I
                 was trying to think of something
                 to say but I was confused and he
                 just kept on -- with his hand --
                 moving it -- under my dress --
                 higher and higher...

    Kevin is rocked.    Trying not to show it.

                               BARBARA (O.S.)
                 ... then I, I was asking him to
                 stop but it was like he couldn't
                 hear me -- he just kept on --

    Suddenly, Gettys' hand stops moving --

                               BARBARA (O.S.)
                 -- and then I screamed...

    Kevin looks up to find Gettys' eyes waiting for him.
    Gettys quickly returns his hand into his lap. He's been
    caught -- watching, as Kevin turns away and --

                               BARBARA
                 ... then he, he got mad and said
                 we would have to try again
                 sometime.

                               PROSECUTOR
                 And did he try again?

                                BARBARA
                 Not with me.

                               PROSECUTOR
                 With friends of yours?

                                BARBARA
                 Yes.

                               PROSECUTOR
                 And when you told them what he had
                 done to you, they told you what he
                 had done to them, isn't that true?

                                BARBARA
                 Yes.

                               PROSECUTOR
                 I have nothing further.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                4.

                        (finding Kevin)
                 Your witness, Mr. Lomax.

                               KEVIN
                 Any chance, Your Honor, for a
                 short recess?

    Kevin heading quickly away from the courtroom.     Gettys
    right on his heels.

                               KEVIN
                 Lloyd, as your attorney, I'm
                 advising you to get the fuck away
                 from me.

                                GETTYS
                 Why?   What are you talking about?

                               KEVIN
                 The wife. The kid. The outrage.
                 You definitely had me fooled.

                               GETTYS
                 You're my lawyer! You're here to
                 defend me!

                               KEVIN
                 You know what I'm thinking? Why
                 don't we put you on the stand and
                 you can jerk off for the judge.

                               GETTYS
                 You know she's lying.

                               KEVIN
                 Get the hell out of my way.

    Gettys standing aside, as we --

3   INT. FLORIDA COURTHOUSE MEN'S ROOM - DAY                         3

    An ancient upstairs facility. Kevin standing at the
    mirror. Frozen there. Identity crisis. Morality
    crisis. He takes off his wedding ring. Letting cold
    water run in the sink. His eyes never leaving the
    mirror.

    Behind him, the door opens.     A local REPORTER enters,
    moves to the urinal.

                               REPORTER
                 Well, hell, there you are. Rumor
                 was you were out wandering in
                 traffic.

                               KEVIN
                 Not now, Larry.

                               REPORTER
                 What's the game plan, Kevin? I
                 got a four-thirty deadline. I
                 need a quote. Gimme a quote.

                                KEVIN
                 Fuck off.

                               REPORTER
                 'Mr. Lomax had no comment on
                 today's events. Speculation,
                 however, was widespread that the
                 young lawyer's unblemished string
                 of victories would come to an end
                 in this courtroom.'

    Kevin pulls some cold water to his face. Startled, as
    THUNDER EXPLODES overhead -- then just as suddenly,
    becomes nothing more than the urinal flushing...

                               REPORTER
                 It was a nice run, Kev. Had to
                 close out someday. Nobody wins
                 'em all.

    The Reporter exits.      Kevin alone with the mirror.

    And then it's over.

    He's made his decision. Replacing his wedding ring.
    Reaching for his jacket, as we --

    Barbara on the stand.   Everyone in place.

                            KEVIN
              Math hasn't exactly been your
              subject this year, has it?

                               BARBARA
              No.

                            KEVIN
              Any theories on why you've done so
              poorly in math this year?

                            BARBARA
              It's not my fault.

                            KEVIN
              Would you say Mr. Gettys is the
              problem?
                     (as she shrugs)
              You're not sure. Have you had
              any discipline problems in math
              class this year?

                               BARBARA
              No.

                            KEVIN
              No? Isn't it true Mr. Gettys has
              had to talk to you repeatedly
              about your behavior? Isn't that
              why he asked you to stay after
              class?

                               BARBARA
              No.

                            KEVIN
              Have other teachers ever asked you
              to stay after class?

                               BARBARA
              Once or twice.

                            KEVIN
              Did they want to talk about your
              behavior?

                              PROSECUTOR
              Objection.    Immaterial.

              Goes to motive.

                 Overruled.    You may answer the
                 question.

                               BARBARA
                 I don't know what the other
                 teachers wanted. You'd have to
                 talk to them.

                               KEVIN
                 You ever pass notes in class,
                 Barbara? Maybe a note that made
                 fun of Mr. Gettys?

                                 BARBARA
                 No.

                               KEVIN
                 No? Never called him a
                 'disgusting pig monster'?

                 I'm gonna let this in, Mr. Lomax,
                 I'm also gonna suggest that if
                 you have any other exhibits you
                 present in a timely fashion or not
                 at all.

                 it's 'huge hog beast'. This is
                 your handwriting, isn't it?

                 You wrote this in his class.

                 It's a joke.

                 'He's a huge hog beast. He
                 probably eats a thousand pancakes
                 for breakfast.' You're writing
                 here about Mr. Gettys, aren't you?

                               BARBARA
                 It was meant to be a joke.

                 Have you ever had a party at your

                 Credibility and bias.

                                JUDGE
                 Overruled.   Answer the question.

                 The word special came up in your
                 testimony earlier. You claimed
                 that Mr. Gettys asked you whether
                 you had special feelings, if you
                 felt special.
                        (beat)
                 Have you ever heard of a game

                 his life is on the line. This is
                 not a joke. Have you ever played
                 the game Special Places?

                 Is this game sexual in nature?

                               BARBARA
                 We only played it once.

                               KEVIN
                 This special party, Barbara, this
                 was the first time you told the
                 story about Mr. Gettys.

                               BARBARA
                 Yes.

                               KEVIN
                 I've spoken to the other children
                 who were there that day. Can you
                 think of anything else, Barbara,
                 they might have told me about that
                 party?

                 Objection. Your Honor, if he has
                 other witnesses let him call them.

                        (right at Barbara)
                 If I need to call those other
                 children, I will.

                               JUDGE
                 I'm gonna sustain that, Mr. Lomax.
                 Rephrase your question.

                               KEVIN
                 You threatened those children,
                 didn't you?

                               BARBARA
                 That's not the way it happened --

                               KEVIN
                 You told them to falsely claim
                 that Mr. Gettys had hurt them,
                 didn't you?

                               BARBARA
                 These things did happen!

                 about this special party.

                               BARBARA
                 They happened to me.

                               KEVIN
                 So you made up a story. A
                 special story, about a math
                 teacher -- a disgusting pig
                 monster -- you didn't like.
                 That's what really happened,
                 isn't it?

                               BARBARA
                 I didn't want to be the only one!

    BARBARA'S FATHER can take it no longer -- suddenly on his

                 You son of a bitch!

    Chaos -- court officers struggling with Barbara's Father
    and people yelling and Gettys hugging his wife and son
    and the gavel banging like mad and Kevin just sitting
    there, staring at the floor, completely drained,
    emotionally, morally, physically and --

    In the back of the room, a man. He's black. Elegant.
    Amused by the scene. His name is LEAMON HEATH.

    MARY ANN LOMAX leans in behind her husband.      She is a

    It's a rock and roll joint. Florida style. But it's
    early and empty. Kevin at the bar with Mary Ann, two
    LAWYER friends, the Reporter and someone's girl friend.
    12 shot glasses, two rows of six. A perfect tequila pour
    and --

                 In the event we all get drunk and
                 forget, I suggest we frontload the

                 So, Kev, off the record, how's it
                 feel to squeeze a man like Gettys
                 through the door of reasonable
                 doubt?

                        (waving him off)
                 I told you already, we're not

    Drunk frat boys laughing as they exit. A BAR BAND in the

     Inside the church. Plain and functional. Poor but
     faithful. A trio -- electric guitar, accordion,
     tambourine -- playing a hymn. Forty-five voices raised
     in song. The tempo is ragged and the pitch shaky, but
     the feeling is strong. They mean it.

     The CAMERA FINDS -- MRS. LOMAX. Kevin's mother. Forty- six.
     Singing her heart out. A woman with faith, in the

     The CAMERA FINDS -- Kevin. In the very back. Standing
     in the doorway. Halfway in. Halfway out. Shadow.
     Light. Waiting.

     VOICES -- KEVIN and MARY ANN. They're LAUGHING. Coming
     in from a big night out. For an instant -- light -- we

               Why, counselor...
                      (her best drawl)
               Surely you don't think a small-

               because a man buys her dinner in
               the big city.

               No, ma'am. In fact, I hardly ever
               think at all.

                             MARY ANN
               Well, that's different, then.

     Criminal court. Voire dire. Potential jurors fill the
     benches. A bored judge. MEISEL, defense counsel, is a
     sour, New York veteran. The juror being questioned, a
     PIE-FACED MAN with bad vision.

                                MEISEL
                  Do you think as a juror you'd be
                  able to set aside any prior
                  opinions you might hold about the
                  savings and loan industry?

                  What?   Do I like bankers?

     Heath catches Meisel's eye.     Waves him over.

                                MEISEL
                  Your Honor, may I have a minute to
                  speak with my colleagues.


     ANGLE ON DEFENSE TABLE

     Kevin and Heath. And the defendant -- a well-tailored
     reptilian banker. Meisel joins them. Sotto voce.

                                KEVIN
                  Dump him. While you're at it
                  let's get rid of number six,
                  eight, and I'd say lose number
                  twelve, except the prosecutor's
                  gonna fuck up and do it for us.

                               MEISEL
                  Number six? You're kidding,
                  right? She's my first choice.

                                KEVIN
                  She's my first pass.

                                MEISEL
                  And eight? With the dreadlocks?
                  That's crazy. He's a defendant
                  juror if I ever saw one.

                                KEVIN
                  You see his shoes?

                                MEISEL
                  Look, kid, maybe down in Florida
                  you're the next big thing, but
                  this is New York. Manhattan.
                  We're not squeezing oranges here.

                  He polishes those shoes every
                  night. He makes his own clothes.
                  He may look like a brother-with-
                  an-attitude to you, but I see a
                  man who's got a shotgun under his
                  bed and woe betide the creature
                  who steps into his garden.

                  And number six? Your favorite?
                  She's damaged goods.

                                MEISEL
                  She's a Catholic schoolteacher.
                         (to Heath)
                  She believes in human frailty.

                                KEVIN
                  No. There's something missing
                  from her. She's wrong.
                         (eyes to the pool)
                  She wants on this jury. Somebody
                  hurt her and she wants revenge.

                                MEISEL
                  How the hell do you know that?

                         (honestly)
                  I don't know.

                         (to Heath)
                  Look, either you put a stop to
                  this happy horseshit or I walk.

                                HEATH
                  Walk.

                                MEISEL
                         (a pause)
                  All right. Here's the deal.
                         (to Kevin)
                  I lose with your jury? You do the

     this space.

     Lawyers come in all shapes and sizes. Assistants -- male
     and female -- are uniformly attractive. The HUM of
     serious BUSINESS in the background.

                                HEATH
                         (as they walk)
                  We've got forty partners vested at
                  the moment. Close to six hundred
                  associates. This is the home
                  office, but we've got quite a few
                  international arrangements, so Mr.
                  Milton spends a good deal of his
                  time in the air. In addition to
                  our corporate clients, we're
                  currently representing about
                  twenty-five foreign countries.
                  Mid-East, Balkans, Central
                  America, West Africa. Interesting
                  work, but travel intensive.

     Kevin slowing as they pass an open doorway --

                                HEATH (O.S.)
                  He's got you scheduled for fifteen
                  minutes, which is a good sign, so
                  make the most of it...


23   INT. LAW FIRM - CHRISTABELLA'S OFFICE - DAY                     23

     THROUGH a large window we see a woman pacing her office.
     She's wearing a headset and arguing in machine-gun
     Italian. She is a goddess. Her name is CHRISTABELLA.
     She is beautiful beyond propriety. She will also turn
     out to be a brilliant EUC lawyer. She turns. Sees us
     staring -- like that -- Venetian blinds close tightly.

     Heath is now far ahead.    Kevin rushing to catch up --


25   INT. LAW FIRM - ARCHED CORRIDOR - DAY                           25

     Kevin about six steps into it when suddenly, he looks
     down. Stops. Completely spooked.

                                HEATH
                  Gotcha.
                         (smiles)
                  Man, I just love that...

     The floor is nothing but glass. Sixty stories above the
     world. A bridge between two skyscrapers.

                                HEATH
                  I watched a Senator piss his pants
                  right where you're standing.

                                  KEVIN
                           (nonplussed)
                  Great.

                                HEATH
                  He's waiting for you.      Good luck.

     Kevin sucks it up.      Starts walking.    Up ahead, nothing
     but an open door.

                                                          CUT TO:

     First of all it's round. And large. The walls are made
     of stone. No windows. There are dramatic shafts of
     natural light from above. Stark and clean to the
     extreme. No paper anywhere.

     Kevin standing there.      Taking in the space.

                                  MILTON (O.S.)
                  Behind you.

     Kevin turns.       There he is.

                                  MILTON
                  Sorry.    Didn't mean to...

                                KEVIN
                  No.  Please.

                  John Milton.

                                KEVIN
                  Nice to meet you.

                                MILTON
                  Have we been treating you well?

                  Your wife, she's had a good time?

                                KEVIN
                  She sure has. It's been great.
                  The whole thing's been great.

                                MILTON
                  Good. That's our secret. We kill
                  you with kindness.
                         (walking the room,
                          circling)
                  What's your secret?

                                KEVIN
                  I couldn't say.

                                MILTON
                  You were a prosecutor.

                                KEVIN
                  Out of law school. Five years in
                  the Jacksonville D.A.'s office.

                                 MILTON
                  Sixty-four straight convictions.
                  What a number.

                                KEVIN
                  I like to be in court.   I didn't
                  plea out a lot.

                                MILTON
                  What's that like? One day you're
                  putting them away and the next
                  you're setting them free?

                                KEVIN
                  Takes a little getting used to.

                                MILTON
                  Pays better though, doesn't it?

                                 KEVIN
                  Yes it does.

                                MILTON
                  The math teacher. The Gettys
                  case. I hear you were brilliant.

                                KEVIN
                  Prosecutor dropped the ball.

                                 MILTON
                  Really.   So you think your guy was
                  guilty.

                                KEVIN
                  I didn't say that.

                                MILTON
                  What did you say?

                                KEVIN
                  How's this? I began the case with
                  a clear conscience.

                                MILTON
                         (quiet a moment)
                  I was sure you had a secret.

                                 KEVIN
                  The men's room.
                         (beat)
                  Upstairs men's room in the Duval
                  County courthouse. There's a hole
                  in the wall. Straight through to
                  the next room.
                         (smiles)
                  I spent five years listening to
                  juries deliberate.

                                 MILTON
                  I love it.

                                 KEVIN
                  Love it all you want, just don't
                  repeat it. I'm not sure the
                  Florida Bar Association would
                  appreciate it.

                                MILTON
                  You don't really want to go back
                  to Florida, do you? Walk with me.

     A reflecting pool. Water right to the edge. A narrow
     walkway straight through the middle. And we're fifty
     stories above the city. The effect is staggering.

                  What do you think? Some people
                  can't handle it.

                                   KEVIN
                  It's peaceful.

                                MILTON
                  Exactly.
                         (pleased)
                  Fill in the resume. Tell me about
                  your family. What does your
                  father do?

                                KEVIN
                  I never got to know my father. He
                  passed away before I was born. My
                  mom raised me. Just the two of
                  us.

                                MILTON
                  She never remarried?

                                KEVIN
                  She wasn't married the first time.

                                MILTON
                  That can't be easy in Gainesville.

                                KEVIN
                  I don't think it's easy anywhere.
                         (re the view)
                  Holy shit...

                                MILTON
                  Little different when you're

                         (beat)
                  Tell me about her. Your mother.
                  What's she like?

                                KEVIN
                  She's a preacher's daughter.
                  She's tough. She's worked in the
                  same poultry plant for as long as
                  I can remember. I think she's up
                  to eight-fifty an hour. She's got
                  a church she really likes, so
                  she's usually either there or they
                  go out, they do a lot of volunteer
                  work.

                  Lotta potential clients down

                  Why do you need a criminal
                  department?

                                MILTON
                  Because our clients break the law
                  just like everyone else and I'm
                  tired of sending their business
                  across the street.

                                MILTON
                  I'm thinking about it. You have

                  thing I wonder about.

                  Pressure. Changes everything.
                  Some people, you squeeze them,
                  they focus. Some people fold.
                  Can you summon your talent at
                  will? Can you deliver on
                  deadline? Can you sleep at night?

                  long it's been since we were all

                  about backbiting, about partners

                  over clients, or worse... I feel
                  drained. It drains me. I feel
                  empty. I feel as though I've
                  let you all down.
                         (off dead silence)

                  quick. Doesn't cost a thing.
                  There's a power to it. What is

                                 DRIVER
                   I gotta stick with the vehicle.

      A storefront botanica. Insane colors. Rusted iron
      grates covering two tiny cataract windows. A steel door
      is open. There's a sick-looking DOG tied to the doorknob;
      he begins BARKING wildly, as he sees --

      Kevin walking from the car.    Suit and tie.     Briefcase.
      Turning, as he hears --

                  You get 'em!   Go get 'em, man!

     Three JUNKIES camped on the stoop of a burned-out
     brownstone across the street. Dull, wasted faces aroused
     by the DOG'S BARKING --

                                JUNKIE
                  Tell her turn that shit down! I
                  know what she's doin'! That's
                  right! Tell 'em take that noise
                  back t'Africa 'fore I --

     Stopping instantly because -- a WOMAN is standing in the
     botanica doorway. Her skin is jet black. Her eyes are
     pale blue. Her hair is white. She holds a live chicken
     by its feet. The DOG is still BARKING so she slaps it.
     Hard. Now there is silence.

                                KEVIN
                  I'm looking for Phillipe Moyez.

     She moves aside.    Kevin enters --


38   INT. DAHOUMEY BAKA - DAY                                        38

     It's dark. Oil lamps and candles for light. The air
     thick with incense. Jars and bags and boxes are stacked
     on shelves everywhere. Powders. Oils. Bones. Skins.
     Potions. Dried herbs.

                                KEVIN
                  I called this morning, I'm not
                  sure who I spoke with.
                         (awkward silence)
                  I'm his lawyer. I have a card...
                         (finding it)
                  They said he would meet me here.
                  Phillipe Moyez.

     Darkness. A door opening above us. A BOY -- maybe ten
     -- standing there. Kevin behind him.

                  Look, I'm not sure I'm making
                  myself clear here.

                                BOY
                  Moyez.
                         (a French accent)
                  You need him. Speak wid him.


40   INT. DAHOUMEY BAKA - STAIRS - DAY                             40

     The Boy hits the lights. A naked bulb on the landing
     below. Beyond that, darkness.

                                KEVIN
                  You're saying he's down here?
                         (incredulous)
                  In the basement? In the dark?

                                BOY
                         (laughing)
                  Where? Where you think -- ?
                  Where you think me taking you?


41   INT. DAHOUMEY BAKA - BASEMENT HALL - DAY                      41

     The Boy, still laughing, starts down the stairs -- into
     the darkness. Kevin hesitates. Sucks it up. Crouching
     not to hit his head as he goes down into --


42   INT. DAHOUMEY BAKA - BASEMENT - DAY                           42

     Around the landing -- the Boy still in front of him and
     -- down -- as another light comes up and the boy moves
     quickly through the space, turning on lamps here and
     there. No furniture. Mounds of bones. The walls
     painted a deep, black red.


43   INT. DAHOUMEY BAKA - MOYEZ'S BASEMENT - DAY                   43

     Kevin waiting as the last light goes on --

                                MOYEZ (O.S.)
                  I thought I would recognize you,
                  but I do not.

     Kevin, spooked, wheels around --

     PHILLIPE MOYEZ squatting in the corner. Skinny and
     intense. His eyes opaque and piercing at the same time.
     At once unassuming and terrifying. A plastic bag of
     fresh green roots in his lap. Ghat. Miraa. African
     cocaine. His teeth black from chewing it.

                                KEVIN
                  Mr. Moyez?
                         (as he nods)
                  We've never met. I'm a lawyer.
                  I'm here about the animals.

                                 MOYEZ
                  As you wish.

                                KEVIN
                  I'll be arguing your case with the
                  city. I need to ask you some
                  questions.
                         (gets folder)
                  I've done a little preliminary
                  research -- precedent -- cases in
                  the past that dealt with Santeria
                  and Vou--

                               MOYEZ
                  No. This is not Santeria. We are
                  not Voodoo. Candomble.
                  Obeayisne. None of that. We are
                  much older. Before. Before all
                  of it.

                                 KEVIN
                  Okay.   Is there a name?   Or...

                                MOYEZ
                  We have papers. At your firm.      We
                  have the tax exemption.

                                KEVIN
                  Okay.  I'll get right into that.
                         (scribbling away)
                  The animals. Let's start with
                  that, then.

                                MOYEZ
                  We have an investment in blood.
                  Think of it as spiritual currency.

     Moyez stands.    Starts slowly across the room.

                                KEVIN
                  Look, Mr. Moyez, I'm going to need
                  your help with this.

                                                          (CONTINUED)

                                 MOYEZ
                  Yes.   That's very clear.

                                KEVIN
                  Perhaps we could start at the
                  beginning?

     Moyez, ignoring him, moves to an old refrigerator beside
     the stairs. For an instant, the door is open -- just a
     glimpse. Meat. Bags of entrails. Jars of blood. Moyez
     goes to a workbench near the wall --

                                 KEVIN
                  Mr. Moyez?

                                MOYEZ
                  What is the name of the man who
                  will prosecute us?

                                KEVIN
                         (scanning file)
                  Merto. Assistant District
                  Attorney Arnold Merto.

                                 MOYEZ
                  Bhalla.   La chemise noire.   Vite!

     The Boy already running up the stairs.       The sound of
     NAILS FALLING onto the workbench --

                                KEVIN
                  What are you doing, Mr. Moyez?

     Moyez stands aside, wiping his hands on his trousers.        A
     huge beef tongue sits on the bench. The nails are
     scattered around it.

                                MOYEZ
                  You can go now. You will have all
                  the help I can give you.

     Moyez now with a hammer. And the nail. Driving it into
     the tongue. Kevin backing away, as we --

     Here -- a scuffle starting -- voices rising -- the camera
     shaking -- we see Bhalla -- and the Woman -- and --

     There -- in the middle, is a goat -- on its knees -- its
     throat has just been cut -- blood pouring into a pan and
     Moyez holding its head with one hand -- a knife in the

     face, and on that image, we freeze frame.

                That's a veal roast, Your Honor.
                U.S.D.A. approved and stamped.
                Eight days ago, in Kansas City,
                two men pushed a calf into a steel
                frame as a third man fired a high-
                voltage staple-gun into the
                animal's skull. Men kill animals
                and eat their flesh. Phillipe Moyez
                killed a goat. He killed a goat.
                And he did it at home, in a manner
                consistent with his religious
                beliefs. Now some people may find
                it bizarre.

                  It's certainly not a religious
                  practice performed by everyone.
                  It's not as common as, say,
                  circumcision. It's certainly not
                  as common as the belief that wine
                  is transformed into blood. It's
                  not even as common as the handling
                  of poisonous snakes to prove one's
                  faith. But Phillipe Moyez isn't
                  two thousand miles away in a
                  stockyard. He doesn't use
                  electricity to kill. And worst of
                  all...
                         (holding up
                           the roast)
                  Phillipe Moyez is not shrink-
                  wrapped.

     Merto begins to cough.    Quietly at first, but...

                  Your Honor, the city timed this
                  police action to catch my client
                  exercising his constitutionally-
                  protected right to religious
                  freedom.

     Merto's coughing getting worse as he tries to stop...

                                JUDGE SKLAR
                  This is a law protecting Kosher
                  butchering.

                                KEVIN
                  Exactly, Your Honor. And I'd like
                  to move at this time for an
                  immediate directed verdict for
                  dismissal.

     Moyez staring a hole in Merto, and the man cannot stop
     coughing...

                                JUDGE SKLAR
                  I happen to know a little bit
                  about Kashrut law, Mr. Lomax.

                  Pamela, you're looking lovely.
                         (to Moyez)
                  Satisfied, Phillipe?

                  Guy like Moyez living in that
                  subterranean shithole all the
                  time he's running around with
                  fifteen million dollars in the
                  bank.

                                KEVIN
                  You gotta be kidding.

                                MILTON
                  What do you think? We're giving
                  you away? He's paying us in
                  goat's blood? I'm billing you
                  out at four-hundred an hour, my
                  friend. I don't see a whole lot
                  of pro bono work in your
                  immediate future.
                         (buzzing here)
                  Seriously, what I like, you got in
                  there with him. Inside the cage.
                  That's instinct. Can't be taught.
                  You gotta hear that on your own.
                  It's gotta be in your blood. It's
                  molecular. I bet I've got five
                  thousand lawyers working around
                  the planet. I couldn't name
                  ten -- couldn't name three --
                  I'd trust with Moyez.

                  What are they doing? They're
                  corporate lawyers, what do
                  you think they're doing? They're
                  busy reducing life and death to
                  the proper position of a semi-
                  colon. They're doing needlepoint.
                  Push button battles. Push button
                  wars. Armies that get so fucking
                  far away from each other they
                  need satellites to tell them
                  who won. No pain. No sound.
                  No smell. One big, multinational
                  circle jerk. You, on the other
                  hand, you're on the slaughterhouse

                  Maybe I did. But don't get too
                  cocky. No matter how good you
                  are. Don't let them see you

                  I've been underestimated from
                  day one. Do I look like a
                  master of the universe? That's

                  What I have? This beautiful girl
                  she's just fucked me every way
                  she knows how -- we're done --
                  she's walking to the bathroom --
                  she turns back -- and there I am.
                  It's me. And she smiles -- it's
                  like a veil coming down across
                  her face -- and that smile, that's
                  a question mark, because she's
                  looking at me, she's wondering,
                  how did that happen? And see,
                  right there, from that moment on,
                  she's got a secret. I'm the hand
                  up Mona Lisa's skirt. I'm the
                  whisper in Nefertitti's ear.
                  I'm a surprise. They never see
                  me coming. That's what you're

                  All what?

     Mary Ann up the hall in the bedroom door.      Finishing her
     makeup for a night out.

                                MARY ANN
                  Oh, that...
                         (smiles)
                  It was gonna be a nursery, but
                  then I remembered you'd have to be
                  home long enough to knock me up,
                  so now I'm thinking of building a
                  law library.

     Kevin smiles.    Drops his briefcase.     Drops his pants.

                                MARY ANN
                  Save the thought. We were due up
                  there fifteen minutes ago.

     She blows him a kiss.    Ducking back into bedroom.

                  Tell me I can handle this.

                  You can handle this.

                                MARY ANN
                  Say something nice.

                                KEVIN
                  Something nice.

     Twice the size of Kevin's place. Decorated and furnished
     to the max. Seventy-five guests and ten in staff. The
     crowd is very smart, sleek, and experienced at these sort
     of things. Mary Ann's hand squeezing Kevin's just a bit
     more tightly as Diana leads them into the throng, and we

     They've found Kevin and Mary Ann.

                             DIANA
               I love the eights. The entire 'A'
               line -- such a great shell.
                      (manic and perhaps
                       a bit insane)
               I do. I envy you. Starting from
               scratch. Do you have your fabrics
               yet? Tell me you don't.

                              MARY ANN
               Not yet.   I don't think so.

                             DIANA
               Come with me. Instantly.
                      (to Kevin)
               I'm borrowing your wife...

                              BARZOON
               Be gentle, honey. These are
               normal people.

     Mary Ann giving Kevin a "help me" look as she's dragged
     into the party --

                               BARZOON

               I swear he can hear us.

               Hell, he can smell us.

                             MILTON

                      (his hand and eyes)
               I was hoping we'd meet tonight.
               And here you are, already swimming

     Even as he says this, he's kissing their smiling cheeks.

                  Deadbeats. I mean, that's what it
                  comes down to. You can call
                  yourself a finance trainee, or
                  a financial resources adviser,
                  or whatever, you're still

                         (looking around)
                  No deadbeats here tonight.

                                MILTON
                  You'd be surprised. There's a
                  lot more fear in this room than
                  you'd think.

                                MARY ANN
                  What do these people have to be
                  afraid of?

                                MILTON
                  Each other. Themselves.   Why?
                  What scares you?

                                MARY ANN
                  Not knowing who the deadbeats are.

                                MILTON
                  You'll figure that out. There's
                  only one thing worth being
                  frightened of anyway, and that's
                  being alone. Truly and finally
                  alone.

                                 MARY ANN
                  Yes.   I think you're right.

                                MILTON
                  You know what terrifies me?
                  Responsibility.

                                 MARY ANN
                  For what?

                                MILTON
                  For what. For you. Let's be
                  honest, I've changed your life.
                  Changed it forever. There's
                  been a seismic shift in your
                  existence and I'm responsible.
                  And you've never even met me.
                  We're talking for the very
                  first time. How insane is that?

                  Kevin. Please. I'm not worried
                  about Kevin. He buys a few new
                  suits. Learns a few new tricks.

                  I tell Kevin the only thing worse
                  than not having a father was
                  having mine.

                                MILTON
                  So you've got a lot at stake here.
                  You've made a real commitment.

                  It's about your hair, some people

                         (there's the mirror)
                  Take a look. See. That's it.
                  Isn't that incredible? You need

                             KEVIN
               Sort of. Not exactly. I'm about
               twelve floors down. What about
               you?

                             CHRISTABELLA
               No, I live downtown. This is the
               family building.

                             KEVIN
               Sounds like fun. Downtown, I
               mean. I'm just getting to know
               the city.

               May we always have more than we
               expect. Salute.

               Amen.

                I'm looking for my husband.

     The Men -- two vaguely familiar faces from the firm.

                              MAN #1
                Don't think he's here.

     And suddenly it's clear, she's walked in on an impromptu

     hiked up, ass in the air. Man #1 fucking her from behind.
     Man #2 is getting blown and --

     The penthouse. One enormous room. Grand scale
     everything. Otherworldly. Staggering. Of special,
     special interest: a huge Bas Relief dominates an entire
     wall. Carved into the marble are human forms -- young,
     naked bodies swimming in a hypnotic chaos of clouds.

     Milton is on the phone. Two lines going. The dialogue
     is unimportant, we'll not understand it anyway -- he's
     going back and forth between Korean and Russian --
     brokering some emergency deal.

     Heath is at the bar, mixing drinks. Barzoon has a cigar.
     Kevin just standing there gaping at the space.

               ... Look at this, I'm not out
               twenty minutes, we're running from
               the goddamn press. Look at those

     ALEXANDER CULLEN turns back from the edge. Forty-five.
     Tan, grief-stricken, and sleep deprived. The space is
     huge and bare. Unfinished concrete. Wide, open views.
     Kevin, Milton, and Barzoon standing there.

                             CULLEN
               ... You may be right, but look at
               it from my point of view. I'm
               sure he's a whiz kid. I believe
               you. But this is my ass we're
               talking.

               Alex, you know how this town works.
               You've got enemies you never heard
               of. And now? Now you're down?
               I'd prepare for a class-A, New York
               pig-fuck. You're going to have to
               ask yourself who you really trust.
               Who do you trust, Alex?

                  You don't have time to shop, Mr.
                  Cullen.
                          (the newspaper)
                  Jury selection started this morning
                  at every breakfast table in the
                  city. You lost round one. This is
                  what people know. They know you
                  and your wife were living
                  separately. They see this maid --
                  Elucinda -- a sixty-eight-year-old
                  grandmother supporting seven
                  children. And then there's your
                  stepson, a ten-year-old with a
                  bullet in his brain. Those are
                  already powerful images in the mind
                  of the public.

                                CULLEN
                  I didn't kill anybody.

                                 KEVIN
                  I'm telling you how it looks. You
                  discover the crime. You call it
                  in. You've got blood on your
                  person and clothes, and --
                         (before Cullen can
                          cut him off)
                  -- and -- your prints are on the
                  murder weapon.

                                CULLEN
                  How do you know that?

                                KEVIN
                  There's a second print in blood --
                  it's a partial of a hand -- on the
                  wall next to th--

                                CULLEN
                  I have keys! I called the cops
                  from the house! I touched the

                         (to Barzoon)
                  I was panicked! I panicked!

                  We need twelve people who can see

                  right now -- this moment -- you

                  I've got a fourteen-year-old
                  stepdaughter who I care more about
                  than anything in the world. They
                  won't let me call her from
                  downtown. They won't let me talk
                  to her after I'm out. I gotta go
                  deal with that first.

                                KEVIN
                  We need to issue a statement.

     Cullen looks to Milton.    Waiting.   Help me.

                                MILTON
                  He's a winner, Alex. And they'll
                  never see him coming.

                                CULLEN
                  I'm gonna make some very tough
                  phone calls. Then I'm gonna take a
                  pill and try to get some sleep. My

               This is three thousand dollars.

                             JACKIE
               Know what you need to do? Buy it.
               Wear it once. And then throw it
               away. That'll loosen you up.

                             DIANA
               I say spend it all. If you're
               never gonna see your husband, you
               might as well have a relationship
               with his money.

               shooting my mouth off, Eddie
               would've put a cellulite clause in

               Dr. Robert,   I'm telling you, he's
               the miracle   man. You've seen my
               new tits, I   mean who does it

                             JACKIE
               Real or not?

               Feel them. Go ahead.     That's the
               ultimate test.

     Before Mary Ann can stop her, Jackie is taking her hand,
     guiding it to her breast, and holding it there.

      Mary Ann very upset.    Kevin has just come home.

                                 MARY ANN
                   I don't care if they can hear me!
                   I don't care! I don't like it here.
                   And these women, my God... I mean,
                   I'm seeing things for crissake!

                                 KEVIN
                   You just left them in the store?

                   Look, calm down, all right?
                   Listen to me... Mare? First,
                   you do this radical thing with
                   your hair...

                                  MARY ANN
                   You hate it.

                                  KEVIN
                   Stop. I think it's fine. But I
                   also think it's traumatic.
                   You've got the pressure of
                   fitting in with new friends,
                   a new place... add three bottles
                   of wine and --

                                 MARY ANN
                   No! It wasn't the wine. It
                   wasn't the wine or my hair or
                   talking to Kathy, because I know

                                 MARY ANN
                   Kevin, I never see you anymore.
                   Now that you've got this big case,
                   it's just only gonna get worse. I
                   don't know anybody here. These
                   women scare the living shit out of
                   me. If you can believe it, I'm
                   actually looking forward to having
                   your mother come and visit.

                                 KEVIN
                   What about the apartment?

                                 MARY ANN
                   Exactly! You just go out -- you
                   buy a few new suits and you're
                   fine. I've got this whole place
                   to fill up and I know we have all
                   this money and it's supposed to
                   be fun, but it isn't! It's like
                   a test! The whole thing is
                   like one big test! I'm lonely.

                                 KEVIN
                   Let's make a baby.

                                 MARY ANN
                   Don't tease me.

                                 KEVIN
                   I wouldn't do that. Unless you
                   asked.

                                 MARY ANN

                   it was before I saw Elucinda's
                   body and then, I mean we've been

                   Right knee. Right hand. It's a
                   strange move you must've made to
                   pick it up.

                   The blood, I don't know, maybe I
                   was trying to avoid the blood.

                   Your hand came from inside and
                   underneath.

                   Tell you what, Melissa, let's talk
                   to her first. See where she
                   stands and take it from there.

                                 PAM
                   I'll make sure Melissa gets down
                   to the car.

                   Mr. Cullen didn't kill those
                   people.

                                 KEVIN
                   That's why we're all working so
                   hard.

      As Melissa exits with Pam, Kevin notices two associates
      carrying boxes far up the hall and we --

      Paper shredders. Half a dozen of them cranking full
      tilt. Stacks of files left to go. Barzoon and six
      associates working late. Shirtsleeves and coffee.

                   me, it'll take all night.

      Barzoon stops as he sees Kevin in the doorway.

                   I thought I was the only one

                   Good news. We just wrapped up
                   with Cullen's assistant. She
                   looks like a great alibi.

                                 BARZOON
                   What a pleasant surprise.

                                 KEVIN
                   But it looks like you have your

122   INT. SUBWAY TO FIGHTS TRAIN - NIGHT                               122

      The car half full. Kevin and Milton standing near the
      door. Right behind them, three guys in the midst of an
      intense conversation in Spanish.

                                 KEVIN
                   So what's this Weaver Commission?

                                 MILTON
                   I don't micro-manage. You find the
                   talent and then you delegate. Who
                   knows what the hell Eddie's up to.
                   He's got a lotta fingers in a lotta pies.

      Suddenly, one of the guys behind them, the biggest of the
      three, we'll call him BIG GUY, turns back --

                                 BIG GUY
                   What the fuck you looking at?
                          (it's Milton he's
                           talking to)
                   You fucking deaf or something?

                                   MILTON
                   No.    I can hear you just fine.

                   Good, 'cause I want you should get
                   your skinny little ass somewhere
                   down the fucking car away from me.

                   Maricela, the moment you left the
                   apartment she was upstairs with
                   Carlos. They're on the pipe right
                   now, my friend. They're in the
                   kitchen splitting a jumbo and then
                   he's going to fuck her in the ass,
                   right on your bed, and she's going
                   to like it.

      Big Guy backing away -- into his friends --

                   Do yourself a favor and put that
                   knife where it belongs.

      The doors open. Big Guy stumbling back -- his friends
      catching him -- helping him off the train -- looking
      back, as the doors close and...

      It's like it never happened. Milton straightening his
      cuffs as the train pulls away.

                   alone, you were going to kick all
                   three of their asses.

       CLICK. The LINE is dead. He looks at the cigarette.
       Takes a hit. Fuck it. And then his eyes find --

       The dressing room across the hall. An open door.
       Inside, a woman, one of the dancers, all but nude,
       stepping into her dress. A simply perfect body.

       And then she turns TOWARD us and it's Christabella --
       clearly -- for a single moment -- before she slams shut
       the door.

       Kevin crosses to the door.   Knocks.   And again.

       The door opens.   A DANCER standing there.    It's not
       Christabella.

                                                       CUT TO:

       Mary Ann rushing through the dark, toward the nursery and
       the sound of the CRYING -- stopping suddenly at the
       nursery door --

                                   MARY ANN
                    How...?   What are you...?


135    INT. LOMAX NURSERY AND HALL - NIGHT                             135

       A one-year-old child sits naked on the floor amidst the
       tools and material.

                                  MARY ANN
                    You poor thing...

       Mary Ann easing slowly forward.

                                  MARY ANN
                    How did you... how did you get
                    here?
                           (billing and cooing)
                    Are you okay? Look at you...
                    hello... hello...
                           (kneeling there)
                    Where's your mommy?

       The baby turns to her voice.     Smiling now.

                    What are you playing with?    What
                    do you have there?

       The baby offers his open hands --

       Viscera. Entrails and blood and slime.        The child's
       hands full of someone's insides...

                    Leave her with me. Let her sleep.

                    hours at least.

      standing there as Cullen comes storming out of the

                   I get one supervised hour a week
                   with my stepdaughter. This is it.
                   You better have a great reason to
                   call me out.

                                 KEVIN
                   Your wife, the day she was killed,
                   had lunch with a friend. She says
                   and I quote: 'Alex is fucking
                   around and I can prove it.'

                   Wrong answer.
                          (listen to me)
                   Your prenuptial agreement is on
                   file at the firm. The contract is
                   null and void in the event of

                          (you asshole)

                    Forget it.    We're not telling that
                    story.

                          (a kiss for her)
                   I think you've met Christabella,
                   and this is Giselle who's just in
                   from Paris.

      A moment of bullshit superficial greetings and then --
      the elevator doors opening and the whole uncomfortable
      clot of them moving into --


157   INT. LOMAX APARTMENT ELEVATOR - NIGHT                            157

      Just enough room.       They ascend.

                                 KEVIN
                   Thanks for the champagne.

                                 MILTON
                   You've very welcome.
                          (to Mrs. Lomax)
                   This isn't really your first visit
                   to New York, is it?

                                    KEVIN
                             (after a moment)
                   Yes.

                                 MILTON
                   She can't believe you're his
                   mother. You've done one helluva
                   job bringing him up, Mrs. Lomax.
                   I'm sure it wasn't easy.

                                  MRS. LOMAX
                   No.

      Mrs. Lomax has been staring, and now Milton meets her
      eyes as the elevator stops and the doors open.

                                 MARY ANN
                   Nice to see you...

                   Have a lovely evening.

      Kevin next out, holding the door, waiting --

                                 KEVIN
                   Mom, we're here...

                                  MRS. LOMAX
                   Yes.   Good night to you.

      Mrs. Lomax takes one last look at Milton as she exits.

                                 MILTON
                   Kevin, hang on...
                          (holding the door)
                   How's Cullen. Everything on beam?

                                 KEVIN
                   That's a long conversation.

      In the b.g., Mary Ann opening the apartment door and
      going inside. Mrs. Lomax right behind her.

                                 MILTON
                          (hush hush)
                   Why don't you come on up?

                                  KEVIN
                   Now?

      Milton smiles.      Christabella smiles.   Giselle smiles.

                                 KEVIN
                   Let's talk tomorrow.

       Milton shrugs. Your loss. Christabella has her hand on
       Giselle's ass, working up her skirt --

       Kevin left standing there as the doors close.

       Mrs. Lomax, subdued, listening to Kevin and Mary Ann
       bickering.

                                  MARY ANN
                    That what you're doing when you're

                    What are we talking about?

                                  MARY ANN
                    You know exactly what I'm talking
                    about.

                                  KEVIN
                    That's ridiculous.

                                  MARY ANN
                    I'm going to bed.

                   I'm worried about her. You
                   shouldn't fight like that.

                                 KEVIN
                   That's not a fight, Ma, it's
                   marriage. Not exactly your area

                   awful hard for me, 'cause I died
                   and went to heaven. Am I happy?

                                 MRS. LOMAX
                   You were always running somewhere.

                                  KEVIN
                   I guess I finally got there.

                   busy this week. Maybe Saturday I
                   can get some time off and...

      Modern. Empty. The JUDGE is a WOMAN. No bullshit.
      Barzoon sitting alone at the defense table. Federal
      prosecutor MITCHELL WEAVER on his feet.

                              WEAVER
                ... there is nothing vague or
                exploratory about this subpoena
                request, Your Honor. We're
                specifically asking for any and
                all documents relating to Devada
                Holdings. It's taken six months
                and seventeen separate motions and
                we still don't know who's
                responsible here. We've got a
                paper trail here that seems to
                stretch into eternity!

                                WOMAN JUDGE
                Mr. Barzoon?

                              BARZOON
                Can't turn over what you don't
                have, Your Honor. We've been
                conducting a comprehensive search
                of our records and I'm sorry to
                say it's a great deal less than
                Mr. Weaver would suggest.

                              WEAVER
                Your Honor, this is outrageous.
                We need to get in there and seize
                these documents before there's
                nothing left!

                              BARZOON
                Your Honor, it's exactly these
                types of insulting accusations --

                             WOMAN JUDGE

171   INT. CULLEN COURTROOM - DAY                                    171

      Packed. JUDGE ARMAND POE presiding. Cullen seated with
      Kevin and Pam. The jury in their box. And prosecutor FRANK
      BROYGO on his feet, just wrapping up his opening statement --

                               BROYGO
                 ... And when all that evidence is
                 laid before you, when all these
                 pieces weave together, you will
                 conclude -- you will know -- that
                 Alexander Cullen is guilty of
                 murdering three people in cold
                 blood with malice aforethought.

      Done.   The courtroom is silent.   The jury liked him.

                               JUDGE POE
                 Mr. Lomax...
                        (checking his watch)
                 We can break for lunch now, or you
                 can do a stop and start...

                               KEVIN
                 If it's a choice, I'll go now. I
                 won't be as long as Mr. Broygo.

                               JUDGE POE
                 Proceed.

                               KEVIN
                 We just spent our morning listening
                 to Mr. Broygo talk about his
                 'evidence'. What he neglected to
                 tell you is what this case is
                 really about. He left out the most
                 important fact of all: Alex Cullen
                 was somewhere else when these
                 murders took place. Now, Alex
                 Cullen has done a lot of things I
                 don't like. He's been a terrible
                 husband to all three of his wives.
                 He's been a destructive force in
                 the lives of his step-children.
                 He's cheated the city. His partners.
                 His employees. He's paid hundreds of
                 thousands of dollars in penalties and
                 fines over the years. I don't like
                 those things. I don't expect you to
                 like them. There will be other things
                 during the course of this trial that
                 you will hear about and like even
                 less. But this isn't a popularity
                 contest. It's a murder trial and
                 Alex Cullen hasn't killed anybody.

                   The state is going all out here.
                   They've got a whole team over
                   there. They're throwing
                   everything but the kitchen sink
                   at this case. I need one thing
                   from you. That's it. One thing.
                   I need you to ask yourself, 'Is
                   not liking this man reason
                   enough to convict him of
                   murder?'

      Kevin thrown back against a wall --

                                 CULLEN
                   What the fuck was that? Are you
                   out of your fucking mind?
                          (murderous)
                   They fucking hate me!

      Kevin -- one push -- Cullen sent flying.

                                 KEVIN
                   Listen to me like you've never
                   listened to anybody before. I'm
                   going to bust my ass to make sure
                   they hate you. Because as long as
                   you're out boning Melissa, you're
                   not home killing your wife.

                           to the idea)
                   Why didn't you tell me before?

                Let me put it this way, then: can
                you tell from a blood sample if
                the person were alive or dead?

                The victim?   Of course not.

                              KEVIN
                And there's a two hour window in
                which to place these murders.

                                 TECHNICIAN
                Yes.

                              KEVIN
                So, you've got absolutely no way
                to determine the condition of the
                victims when Alexander Cullen put
                his hand on that wall.

       Standing there above him, a crazed-looking homeless
       MAN -- he's white and old and hungry --

                               OLD MAN
                 Gimme your watch.

                You take a look at Eddie Barzoon
                you gotta wonder if maybe God
                overplayed his hand. Maybe he

                interesting.

                You testified that the defendant

      front. Mary Ann in back, wrapped in a comforter.

                Mare. It's me.

                              MARY ANN
                He let himself in. You need to
                know that. The bath running, or
                something, I didn't hear him. I

                        for good)
                I haven't talked to anyone, really
                talked to anyone in such a long
                time. You have this whole life
                and all I have is me and he was so
                clear about it all.

                              KEVIN
                Who let himself in?

                              MARY ANN
                I came down here. I've just been
                sitting. I'm afraid to pray. I
                let him stay. I'm sorry. I'm
                sorry. I'm sorry, Kevin.

                              KEVIN
                Did somebody hurt you?

                              MARY ANN
                Milton. He fucked me, Kevin. I
                let him fuck me. I couldn't stop
                him.

                                  KEVIN
                What?     When?

                   I'm learning about you, Kevin. I
                   talked to some old friends down in

                            slow down)

                   the body of a ten-year-old girl in
                   the trunk of his car.

      Kevin, across the street, stops.

       But someplace completely different. Older.        Dark.   Empty.
       Echoey. A fluorescent bulb sputtering out.

       FOOTSTEPS approaching...

       It's Kevin. And we know instantly that Mary Ann is dead.
       There's blood on his shirt. His eyes are raw. At his
       side, a small suitcase containing her personal effects.
       More than grief, more than shock, what we notice most is
       his frighteningly grim determination.

       Up ahead, a bench. Mrs. Lomax huddled here. Cried out.
       Empty. Holding herself more tightly as he sets down the
       suitcase.

                                  MRS. LOMAX
                    I could've packed that up for you.

       Kevin sits.    If he loses his steel he'll drown.

                                 KEVIN
                   Finish the story.
                          (off silence)
                   Nineteen-sixty-four. You're in
                   New York. There's a waiter in a
                   restaurant.
                          (waiting)
                   Finish the story.

                                 MRS. LOMAX
                   He talked to me. Nobody'd ever
                   really talked to me before. Sixteen
                   years old, a thousand miles away
                   from home, somebody takes an
                   interest... Working so hard,
                   putting himself through school,
                   I'd never met anybody like that.
                   Knew the Bible, every word, just
                   knew it by heart. Every meal,
                   there he was, at my ear and I
                   just... I didn't want that week to
                   ever end. But it did. He came to
                   say goodbye, it was late, and I
                   started to cry and he said not to
                   worry, 'Behold, I send you out as
                   sheep amidst the wolves.' And that
                   just stopped me cold because we'd
                   spent that whole day at Bible study
                   reading Matthew Ten and there was
                   just no way for him to know about
                   that, so I was... I took it as a
                   sign. I let him in. And then
                   everything was different. He was
                   cruel. He was so cruel and I was
                   so ashamed, I thought I'd die...

      Kevin's eyes settle on the suitcase.      Mary Ann...

                                 MRS. LOMAX
                   I promised right there if God would
                   let me back into His grace I would
                   never leave again. I prayed there
                   was a reason this terrible thing
                   had happened. There had to be a
                   reason. And there was. It was
                   you. You were my blessing. You
                   were reason enough to endure
                   anything. How much I love you.

                                 KEVIN
                   I want to hear you say it.

249   EXT. HOSPITAL EXIT AND STREET - DAY                                249

      Fifty-seventh Street is empty. No cars. No people.
      Just the building and the silence. Turning back and
      Pam is gone, and then --

      And then a WIDER ANGLE -- it goes on and on... He's alone.
      Just now realizing the scale of Milton's power. Starting
      to walk, as we --

                                                        CUT TO:


250   INT. MILTON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                    250

      The room's only light coming from the huge bas relief.
      Kevin steps off the elevator, into the room.

                                 MILTON (O.S.)
                   You're right about one thing... I
                   have been watching. Couldn't help
                   myself. Watching, waiting, holding
                   my breath. But I'm no puppeteer,
                   Kevin...

      Milton appears out of nowhere.       Walking past Kevin.

                                 MILTON
                   ... I don't make things happen.
                   Doesn't work like that. Free
                   will -- it's like butterfly wings --
                   one touch and it never gets off the
                   ground. I only set the stage. You
                   pull your own strings.

      Kevin has a gun -- Cullen's gun, in his hand --

                                 KEVIN
                   What did you do to Mary Ann?

                                  MILTON
                   A gun?   In here?

                                 KEVIN
                   What did you do to my wife?

                                 MILTON
                   On a scale of one to ten, ten
                   being the most depraved acts of
                   sexual theater, one being an
                   average Friday night run-through
                   at the Lomax household, I'd say...
                          (beat)
                   Six.

      Kevin FIRES the GUN -- BANG! BANG! BANG! -- bullets pass
      right through him -- into the wall --

                                 MILTON
                   Whoa... Got me! Damn!
                          (laughing)
                   That's my boy. Step on up! Stay
                   angry! Keep hold to that great
                   fury! Hang on tight, Kevin, because
                   it's the final fig leaf.

      Kevin lowers the gun to his side.

                                  KEVIN
                   Who are you?

                   Never lost a case. Why? Why?
                   Because you're so fucking good?
                   Yes. But why?

                                 KEVIN
                   Because you're my father.

                                 MILTON
                   Well, I'm a little more than that.
                   Awful hot in that courtroom, wasn't
                   it? 'What's the game plan, Kevin?'
                          (reporter's voice)
                   'It was a nice run, Kevin. Had to
                   close out someday.'

                                   KEVIN
                   Who are you?

                                 MILTON
                   I have so many names.

                                   KEVIN
                   Satan.

                                   MILTON
                   Call me Dad.

                                 KEVIN
                   Mary Ann, Barzoon, Weaver...

                                 MILTON
                   Come on. You're not listening.
                   Blaming me for Mary Ann? I hope
                   you're kidding. You could've saved
                   her any time you liked. She only
                   wanted love. But you knew it
                   wouldn't really work out, didn't
                   you? Mary Ann in New York? Face
                   it, you started looking to better-
                   deal her the minute you got here.

                                   KEVIN
                   That's a lie.

                                 MILTON
                   Hey, it's not that you didn't care
                   for her, it's just you were a
                   little bit more involved with
                   someone else. Yourself.

                                 KEVIN

                   Don't be such a fucking chump.

                   all of creation and that is self-
                   delusion. I told you to take care
                   of your wife -- that the world
                   would understand. And you made a
                   choice. 'You know what scares me,
                   John? I leave the case, she gets
                   better and I hate her for it...'

                   You set me up.     It's entrapment.

                                 MILTON
                   Who told you to pull out the stops
                   for Mr. Gettys? And Moyez -- the
                   direction you took -- Snake
                   handlers, Popes and swamis all
                   feeding at the same trough -- whose
                   ideas were those? And then
                   Cullen -- knowing he's guilty --
                   seeing those pictures -- putting
                   that lying bitch on the stand...
                   What did I say, Kevin? Maybe it was
                   time to lose, right? You didn't
                   think so.

                                    KEVIN
                   That's my job.     That's what I do!

                   Vanity is definitely my favorite
                   sin. Self love. It's so basic.
                   What a drug. Cheap, all-natural,
                   and right at your fingertips.
                   Pride. That's where you're
                   strongest. And believe me, I
                   understand. Work for someone
                   else? -- Hey, I couldn't hack it.

                I've had many children, Kevin. So
                many disappointments. Neurotic,
                indecisive wannabes. Over-eager,
                ham-handed butchers. Strung-out,
                priapic losers. And then there's
                you. Your mother, I'll tell you,
                she outstripped my wildest fantasy.
                That church she dragged you to?
                Every day? What training. What
                a challenge! It's awesome what
                you've done. How far you've come.
                Both of you... You and your sister.

                No. That's the other guy. I

                   Your witness, Mr. Lomax.

                                 KEVIN
                   Your Honor, I'm terribly sorry,
                   but I can no longer represent my
                   client. I need to be replaced as
                   counsel.

      Another silence. But this one isn't very long. There
      will be chaos in the courtroom. Gettys will freak out
      and the press will start running for the phones and the
      Judge will be banging that gavel, as we --

                   Kevin! -- Hey!

                   dream about --

                   There is no story.

                                 REPORTER
                   Bullshit. A lawyer with a crisis
                   of conscience? You gotta be
                   kidding. It's huge!

                   They're gonna disbar me, Larry.
                   You can cover that.

                                 MARY ANN
                   Can they do that?

                                 REPORTER
                   Not when I get through with the
                   story.
                          (still walking)
                   You gotta talk, Kevin. You gotta
                   gimme an exclusive.
