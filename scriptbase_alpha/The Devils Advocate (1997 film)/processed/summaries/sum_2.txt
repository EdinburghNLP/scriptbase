Kevin Lomax, a ruthless young Florida attorney that never lost a case, is recruited by the most powerful law firm in the world.
In spite of his mother's disagreement, which compares New York City to Babylon, he accepts the offer and the money that comes along.
But soon, his wife starts feeling homesick as she witnesses devilish apparitions.
However, Kevin is sinking in his new cases and pays less and less attention to his wife.
His boss and mentor, John Milton, seems to always know how to overcome every problem and that just freaks Kevin right off.
