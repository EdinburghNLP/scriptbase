                         BLACK RAIN

                       Craig Bolotin

                             &

                        Warren Lewis




                                             November 1987






     A BLACK SCREEN:

     Various voices:       "Big six"... "That's six the hard way"...
                 "Seven or eleven"... "Play two"...

     FADE IN:

     EXT.  UPPER EAST SIDE - NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

     One of the pristine blocks of brownstones where even the
     garbage seems gift wrapped.  The VOICES continue over as
     we move in on a particular building where a DOORMAN is
     holding open the door for a dowager and her poodle.

     The voices continue:  "Hit me"... "Double down"... "Let it
     ride"... "Hit me"... "Anymore for the come out"...
     "Card"...

     In contrast to the outside of this sedate, quiet
     brownstone, we go inside to find...


     INT.  BROWNSTONE APARTMENT

     ... a miniature Las Vegas, complete with music, drinks,
     tuxedoed dealers and croupiers:  roulette, craps, Black
     Jack.  Wall to wall people.  The fact that casino gambling
     happens to be illegal in New York doesn't stop these
     Connecticut slummers, hollow-cheek nightlifers, and junior
     wiseguys from having a good time.

     AT THE CARD TABLE

     NICK CONKLIN, holding a dollar cigar, is trying to pull a
     winning hand.  In his late thirties, Nick has the sort of
     quiet good looks that takes an extra glance to appreciate.
     His Moe Ginsburg rent-a-tux is too tight, his ruffled
     shirt, out of date; Nick could care less.

     Two other players are still in the game.  One of them is a
     lithe DEBUTANTE surrounded by an entourage of giggling
     friends and tuxedoed men.  The pot is huge.

     Nick flips two one hundred dollar chips onto the pot.

                         NICK
               One, and one on top.

                         DEALER
               House sees.

                         PLAYER ONE
                    (hesitates)
               I'm out.

     Disgusted, he throws down his cards.

     It's down to Nick and the debutante.  The cocky deb gives
     Nick a long look, confident she can win.

                         DEBUTANTE
                    (her eyes still on
                     Nick)
               I see the deuce, and one to chase
               them home.

     She throws her chips on the pot.  Nick hesitates, then
     decides to match it.

                         NICK
               Call.

                         DEBUTANTE
                    (showing her hand)
               Ladies, aces wired.  Sorry sport.

     Nick turns over his cards, Jacks and tens, not good enough
     to win.  Elated, the deb gets up from the table and joins
     her giggling friends.  Nick walks over to her.

                         NICK
               Very nice, Barbie.
                    (pointing toward her
                     boyfriend)
               Now, I'd take Ken over there and go
               home.

                         DEBUTANTE
               Why's that?

                         NICK
               It's time.  That's all.

                         BOYFRIEND
               The lady wants to play.  Someone
               should teach you to be a better
               loser, loser.

                         NICK
               Listen, Ken --

                         BOYFRIEND
               My name is not Ken --

                         NICK
               -- I'm offering you the benefit of
               my experience.

                         DEBUTANTE
               Looks like you have a lot of
               experience in places like this.  It
               was nice of them to relax the dress
               code for you.

     That draws a laugh from her friends.  The entourage heads
     for the bar.

     CHARLIE SKLOARIS, twenty-three, steps in front of the
     debutante, blocking her path.

     She steps to the side.  Charlie steps with her.  Charlie's
     pushing it, he's always pushing it.  She's not amused.
     Finally, Charlie lets her pass.  He comes up to Nick.

                         CHARLIE
               Typical New York woman, big
               attitude, small apartment, no tits.

     Only two things count to Charlie:  his job and his women,
     but not necessarily in that order.

                         CHARLIE
               I think she got to you, pappy.

                         NICK
                    (checking his watch)
               You want a popsicle, go to Good
               Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'

                         CHARLIE
                    (glancing at the
                     door)
               Still, you gotta wonder how she'd
               look in handcuffs.

     Nick, wary, eyes this kid.  Charlie shrugs, spreads his
     arms defensively.  The SOUND of pounding on the front
     door.

     THE DOOR

     splinters.  The bouncer steps back as four helmeted
     emergency service officers -- the first members of the
     raiding party -- rush in.

     Pandemonium.  People rush for the exit -- any exit.

     AT THE BAR

     Nick and Charlie hold up their glasses.

                         NICK
                    (calmly)
               Alley oop.

     They down their drinks, then set them down.

     Charlie pulls out the Binaca, offering Nick a spritz, but
     Nick is already pulling out his POLICE BADGE and hanging
     it around his neck.  Charlie quickly follows suit.

     A HALF DOZEN COPS

     line the patrons up against the wall.  The Asst. D.A.,
     PATTY ZACHARA, climbs onto the crap table.  A petite,
     nervous woman, Patty has dressed in a Channel suit for the
     occasion.

                         ZACHARA
               Settle down.  Hey, quiet... Please.

     Not a prayer.

                         NICK
               SHUT THE HELL UP, GODDAMNIT!

     That quiets them.

                         NICK
               My name is Conklin.  Let's do this
               fast so I can go home.

     Zachara, annoyed, looks at Nick.

                         NICK
                    (softer)
               It's all yours.

                         ZACHARA
                    (reads)
               Under section 216 of the New York
               State Penal code, I serve notice
               that this premise and it's
               occupants...

     NICK

     catches the Debutante's eye across the room.  She smiles
     at him, he was right.  He shrugs, spreads his hands.
     That's life.

     A well groomed middle aged man, who we'll come to know as
     CAVELLO, suddenly bolts from the crowd lined up against
     the wall.

     Charlie spins around to stop him --

                         CHARLIE
               Whoa -- where do you think you're
               going, hotdog.

     Cavello butts him with his head, sending Charlie to the
     floor.  Then, crosses his arms in front of his face and
     plunges through the WINDOW.

     Nick, not missing a beat, gives a small sigh as he
     follows.

                         NICK
                    (sighs)
               Fabulous...

     He takes off after him.


     EXT.  STREET UPPER EAST SIDE - NIGHT

     Nick, short of breath, chases Cavello down the residential
     street, past the dog-walkers, past the doormen, past the
     fur-coated women climbing out of taxies... Unfortunately,
     Cavello has a good half block on him.

     From nowhere, Charlie blasts past leaving Nick a half
     block behind, silently cursing his age.

     AT THE CORNER

     a limo jerks to a halt, and Cavello jumps in.  The limo
     streaks away.

     CHARLIE

     turns to see Nick, hands on knees, gasping for air.

                                         CUT TO:

     INT.  LOCKER ROOM - TWO EIGHT PRECINCT - NIGHT

     Now in their street clothes, Charlie and Nick stand in
     front of the mirrors.  Charlie is working his brush and
     hair dryer as if his life depended on it.  Nick, in
     contrast, shoves his hair back with his fingers and
     glowers at himself in the mirror.

                         CHARLIE
                    (over the dryer)
               ... It's not like you were slow or
               anything... I think you did just
               fine.  I think you did great.

                         NICK
               Thanks.

     Nick turns to leave.

                         CHARLIE
               Hey, hey, where you goin'?

                         NICK
               Home.


     EXT.  POLICE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     Nick strides out the door.  Charlie hurries after him.

                         CHARLIE
               Wait up.  You know the guy who did
               the Weismuller through the window --

                         NICK
               -- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.

     Charlie trails Nick to his motorcycle:  a Harley hog
     complete with wide gleaming fenders and twin tanks.  The
     bike is held together with tape and baling wire.

                         CHARLIE
               You know him?

     Nick tries to kick-start this behemoth, but it's not easy.

                         NICK
               He works for Frank Abolofia.
               Atlantic City.  Casinos.

                         CHARLIE
               So why dive through the glass for a
               nickel and dime bust?

     Charlie puts his foot up on Nick's fender to tie his shoe.
     Nick, spotting an ankle holster peeking from Charlie's
     sock, grabs Charlie's foot.  Charlie teeters.

                         NICK
               What's this?

                         CHARLIE
               Let go...

     Nick pulls out a Beretta 32.

                         CHARLIE
               Back-up.

                         NICK
               Get rid of it.

                         CHARLIE
               Why?

                         NICK
               It's not regulation.  And the only
               way you're gonna stop anybody with
               it is to show it to him, and while
               he's laughing, you can shove it down
               his throat.

                         CHARLIE
                    (looking at Nick's
                     bike)
               I'll get rid of it when you get rid
               of the egg-beater.

     The Harley comes to life spitting a cloud of blue smoke.
     Nick puts on his paint-flecked helmet, slides down some
     ski goggles.

                         CHARLIE
               Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag
               Cavello.

                         NICK
               Charlie...

     Nick pops the bike into gear.

                         NICK
               ... You still got shaving cream on
               your ear.

     Nick rolls out and disappears in a haze of blue smoke.


     EXT.  BELT PARKWAY - VERRAZANO BRIDGE - NIGHT

     WE FIND Nick, a lonely, solitary figure bobbing in and out
     of the lights and shadows.  The SOUND of wind whips
     through his helmet; cold air stings his cheeks... The tail
     lights of Nick's bike disappear into the night.


     EXT.  SUBURBAN STREET - STATEN ISLAND - NIGHT

     Civil service heaven.  Nick hits the cut switch and glides
     past the manicured lawns and well kept houses of this
     development.  A basketball net in every driveway, a Buick
     or Chrysler in every garage.

     One house sticks out.  The lawn is brown, paint is peeling
     off the garage door and newspapers are scattered on the
     driveway.  Nick glides once around the cul de sac looking
     at the house.  His house.  It's as inviting as an open
     grave.  He shoots away.


     INT.  EL GRECO DINER - STATEN ISLAND - NIGHT

     A hanger sized roadhouse, wall to wall red velvet.

     Nick's the sole figure at the counter, coffee and the
     Daily News in front of him.  A NURSE walks in and sits
     down a half dozen seats away.  Nick look up.

                         NICK
               Short shift?

                         CONNIE
               Yeah... I came to save you.  If
               you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.

                                         CUT TO:

     INT.  CONNIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Nick and Connie are in bed.  They're both looking up at
     the ceiling.  They've just made love.

                         CONNIE
               It's getting too cold even for me,
               Nick.

                         NICK
               Connie...

                         CONNIE
               All right, how's the new partner?

                         NICK
               High spirits, desire, commitment.

                         CONNIE
               You'll take care of that.

                         NICK
               Give me a break, would you?

                         CONNIE
               If you give me one.

     Nick kisses her.  The first suggestion of real affection.
     The SOUND of someone KNOCKING on the door.  Reluctantly,
     they stop.  Connie gets up and puts on her robe.

                         NICK
               Are you expecting anyone?

                         CONNIE
               I wasn't expecting you.

     She disappears down the hallway.  We HEAR the door open,
     then telling someone to wait.

                         CONNIE
                    (poking her head in
                     the room)
               Imagine a small, greasy Boy Scout.

                                         CUT TO:

     INT.  CONNIE'S APARTMENT

     Nick, wearing only his pants, is doing a slow burn.
     Charlie is holding his hands up defensively.

                         CHARLIE
               ... I found the goombah... Cavello.
               He's --

                         NICK
               -- I should tear your head off.

                         CHARLIE
               Whoa, I knew you were going to say
               that.  I absolutely anticipated
               that, Nick.  But I said to myself,
               Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on
               this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll
               be pissed for a moment, but then
               it'll dawn on him --

                         NICK
               -- Hey, I got a better chance of
               being hit by a bus then moving up.

     Charlie looks away momentarily, letting it slide.  He
     knows he's on sensitive ground.

                         CHARLIE
               ... Look... they told me at the
               Greek's you were here.  I'm sorry, I
               never imagined...

                         CHARLIE
                    (buddy buddy)
               I like her.  She's nice.
                    (lowering his voice)
               For her age.

     The bedroom door opens.  Connie enters, dumps Nick's
     clothes on the couch, tosses his gun on top of the pile.
     Without a word, she goes back inside and slams the door
     behind her.

     Nick, pissed, slowly turns to face Charlie.  Charlie
     shrugs.  Nick's got nothing better to do than go.

                                         CUT TO:

     INT.  LIME HOUSE - CHINATOWN - NIGHT

     The Lime House is a little piece of Italy in the heart of
     Chinatown, and tonight, it's packed.  Any selection on the
     jukebox that isn't Frank Sinatra is Jerry Vale.  Behind
     the bar are two fat BROTHERS.  One pours drinks, the other
     dishes out Scungilli.  It's three a.m.  It's always three
     a.m. at the Lime House.

     AT THE BACK TABLE

     Our man CAVELLO is unloading steaming Scungilli onto an
     already heaping plate in front of an imperious looking
     JAPANESE MAN.  The Japanese Man, in his mid-fifties, wears
     a gray suit, and not a strand of his jet black hair is out
     of place.

     A Japanese TRANSLATOR, doing his best to translate
     Cavello's heavily accented English, sits between them.

     AT THE BAR

     Charlie is looking straight ahead, afraid Cavello might
     peg him.  Nick is at ease.

                         CHARLIE
               What are they doing now?

                         NICK
               Eating Scungilli, just like the last
               time you asked.

                         CHARLIE
               Who do you think the Jap is?

                         NICK
               Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru.
               How would I know?

                         CHARLIE
               I don't blame you for being sore.
               It'll pass when we bag him.

     Charlie, trying to relax, gestures toward his foot.

                         CHARLIE
               Whatdaya think?  'Bostonians'.
               Eighty-five bucks.
                    (lowering his voice)
               Girls go for shoes.  Second place
               they look.
                    (off Nick's
                     reaction)
               Hey, I read it in a magazine.

     Nick's attention is drawn to a trio walking in the door.

                         NICK
                    (dead serious)
               Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise
               me?

                         CHARLIE
               What?

     WHAT THEY SEE:  TWO BODYGUARDS are making a quick sweep of
     the bar.  FRANK ABOLOFIA, s stocky man with silver grey
     hair, sweeps in behind them.  Abolofia has mitts like a
     meat packer and a fifty dollar manicure.  A heavyweight
     Mafioso.

                         NICK
               Frank Abolofia.

                         CHARLIE
               The Wolf?

     Abolofia walks to Cavello's table.  All rise and shake
     hands.  The two hitters take seats at the bar.  The two
     brothers scramble to serve their distinguished guests.

                         NICK
                    (in a whisper)
               Some party.

                         CHARLIE
               Maybe we should do something?

                         NICK
               Charlie, take your gum, stick it
               under your ass and keep it warm.

     Nick turns away, resumes his drink.

     NICK'S POV IN THE MIRROR BEHIND THE BAR:  two new Japanese
     men step in the door.  Early twenties, spiky hair, dark
     Versace suits.

     NUMBER ONE

     wears tortoise shell shades.  He coolly checks out the
     room then nods to --

     NUMBER TWO

     who pulls a Spas 12, automatic shotgun from under his
     coat, and spits out three rounds.  A window shatters.
     Everyone hits the floor.

     NUMBER ONE

     slowly walks toward Cavello's table.

     NUMBER TWO

     covers the floor.  Abolofia's bodyguards show their empty
     hands.

     NICK AND CHARLIE

     on the floor.  They don't have the artillery for this guy
     either.

     AT THE TABLE

     Our Japanese businessman knows these people.  He eyes them
     contemptuously.

     Abolofia has put enough people in this situation to be
     philosophical about it.  He stops chewing.  A tiny
     hand motion to his bodyguards is enough to stop any
     precipitous action.

                         NUMBER ONE
                    (in Japanese)
               Give it to me.

     The Japanese businessman looking straight ahead.  A long,
     silent pause... Then, still not facing him:

                         BUSINESSMAN
                    (in Japanese)
               Go to hell.

     Number One slips his fingers beneath his shades, massaging
     his eyes.  IN A FLASH, he pulls a shuto from under his
     coat.  The 18 inch blade gleams like a neon tube.

     He presses the tip of the blade against the businessman's
     throat.

     CHARLIE

     his hand close around the grip of the Beretta.  He unsnaps
     the ankle holster.  The SNAP can be heard across the room.
     Nick's hand closes around Charlie's and squeezes till the
     knuckles turn white.

                         CHARLIE
                    (in a whisper)
               What are you doing?

                         NICK
               Saving your life.

     NUMBER TWO

     levels the scattergun at Nick and Charlie.

     AT THE TABLE - NUMBER ONE

     calmly holds the blade at the man's throat as he reaches
     into the man's jacket and removes a small, rectangular,
     plastic-wrapped parcel.

     He feels its weight, then flips it to NUMBER TWO.

     Abolofia, realizing that whatever is going on doesn't
     affect him or his, resumes eating.

                         ABOLOFIA
               You people are wild... Wild.

     NUMBER ONE backs the blade off.  The man raises his napkin
     to the small wound.  A droplet of blood has stained his
     shirt collar.  NUMBER ONE turns around as if to leave.

     What happens next could be a whim, an after thought.
     Number One spins around and THRUSTS the blade deep into
     the man's chest.  He withdraws it with a half twist, and
     in the same motion fatally slashes the translator's throat
     before the old man's body hits the floor.

     Blood pours from the businessman's mouth onto his
     Scungilli, spreading across the white cloth and onto the
     floor.

     CAVELLO

     reaches for a gun under his coat.  But NUMBER TWO pumps
     two rounds into his face.  At this range, there's not much
     left.

     The killers slowly back out the door, covering the room
     with the scattergun.  The minute the door shuts, Nick
     leaps up, pulling his shield and revolver.

                         NICK
                    (shouting)
               Police officers.  Everybody stay
               put.
                    (to Charlie)
               Get back up.

     Abolofia's eyebrows rise at this development.

     Nick bolts out the door leaving Charlie in charge.  He's
     never been in charge before.

                         CHARLIE
                    (nervously showing
                     shield)
               Police.


     EXT.  THE LIME HOUSE - NIGHT

     A Lincoln tears around the corner to pick the killers up.

     Nick flies out the Lime House door and hits the ground.

     Number Two pumps out shells as fast as he can squeeze the
     trigger.  He's wild.  The front windows of the Lime House
     shatter.

     The LIMO DRIVER jerks to a halt.  Number Two tosses the
     package to him.

     Nick empties his revolver.  Number Two goes down.

     The driver floors the accelerator, leaving Number One to
     take off on foot.  Nick follows, reloading as he runs.


     INT.  THE LIME HOUSE

     Everyone's frozen on the floor.

                         CHARLIE
               Call 911.  Tell them an officer
               needs assistance.  Say ten thirteen.

     Nothing from the owner who looks at Abolofia.  Charlie
     grabs the owner by his collar and shoves him toward the
     phone.

                         CHARLIE
               Do it, you dumb bastard!

     Suddenly Charlie feels something wet at his feet.  He
     looks down to see that he's standing in a pool of blood
     from the massacre.  So much for his new shoes.

     He wheels around, then quickly backs out the door.


     EXT.  STREET - DOWN THE BLOCK FROM THE LIME HOUSE

     Deserted.  The wail of police sirens in the distance.
     Charlie has his gun out.  He's drenched in sweat.  Where
     is his partner?

                         CHARLIE
               NICK...!  Shit... SHIT!!

                                         CUT TO:

     ANOTHER STREET - ALLEY - NIGHT

     Nick, gun drawn, slowly rounds the corner to the alley:
     it's the ad hoc drugstore for the night.  Drugs going up
     and down in pails, two dozen junkies buying, shooting,
     slumped on the ground.  Everyone scatters -- the one's
     that can.

     AN ABANDONED PAIL

     swings slowly back and forth from three stories up.  Nick
     cautiously moves down the alley, holding the gun in both
     hands.  A Junkie steps out of a doorway, Nick swings his
     gun and nearly blows him away.

     NUMBER ONE

     We see his eyes first as he steps out of the darkness at
     the back of the alley.  From now on we'll call him KOBO.
     His sunglasses are on his forehead; his hands dropped
     casually at his side.  A very cool character.

     Kobo slowly raises his hand, and making a gun with his
     finger, slowly points and "shoots" at Nick... He lowers
     his hand.

                         NICK
               On the ground, man.  NOW!!

     Kobo cups his hands around his ear.  He doesn't understand
     English.  Nick, keeping his gun fixed, comes up to him and
     kicks out his legs.

     Kobo falls flat on his chest.

     Nick pulls out his cuffs.  But Kobo lunges for Nick's
     ankle and yanks it toward him.  Nick stumbles backward;
     Kobo's on his feet.  Before Nick can stand, Kobo lands a
     brutal kick to the side of Nick's head.

     Nick gets up, barrels into him.  Kobo knees Nick in the
     solar plexus, then lands two more well placed kicks in
     Nick's back.  It's not that Nick's a bad fighter, it's
     that this kid is so damn fast.

     Nick slowly gets to his feet.  KOBO lands two more brutal
     shots to the side of Nick's head.  He's a bloody mess.

     TWO POLICE CARS

     stop at the end of the alley.  FOUR OFFICERS climb out.

     CHARLIE

     joins the cops as they run down the alley to find Nick
     getting pummeled.

     Charlie shoots at Kobo.  Misses.  Kobo turns to see the
     five cops, guns drawn.

     Nick, on one knee, spits out blood and a few teeth.

     Kobo calmly slips the shuto out of his coat pocket and
     drops it next to Nick.  The blade gleams in the light.
     That was next.  Nick got lucky.

     Kobo towers imperiously above Nick.  Their eyes lock.  We
     hold then...

                                         FADE TO BLACK.

     FADE IN:

     NICK'S LIVING ROOM - STATEN ISLAND - MORNING

     There isn't a stick of furniture, but that's not the half
     of it.  In the middle of the room is a motorcycle on a
     centerstand.  A drop cloth is spread around it, tools
     neatly aligned.  It's a Harley -- but this one is in
     perfect condition.

     A phone RINGS insistently from off screen, then stops.

                         NICK (O.S.)
               Yeah... sure, sure I'll be down.

     Nick walks in, naked.  Every muscle aches.  One side of
     his face is completely swollen.  He has a band-aid over
     his right eye; some blood caked on his earlobe.  He stops
     to twist a spark plug in with a ratchet, but it snaps.

                                         CUT TO:

     INT.  EIGHT - THREE PRECINCT - DAY

     CAPT. OLIVER, early forties, walks between Charlie and
     Nick as they head toward the Medical Examiner's room.
     Oliver doesn't face Nick as he speaks; no love lost
     between these two.

                         OLIVER
               How big a package we talking about?

                         NICK
                    (holding up his
                     hands)
               This by this...

                         OLIVER
               Dope?

                         NICK
               Not in that company.

                         OLIVER
               The old man was a Japanese paper
               manufacturer.  Hotel room and rental
               car were full of it.

                         CHARLIE
               Full of what?

                         OLIVER
                    (annoyed)
               Art and stationary paper.  Cavello
               had five hundred thousand in his
               attache case.

     Nick rubs the back of his neck in obvious pain.

                         OLIVER
               One guy do all the damage?

                         NICK
               Yeah.

                         OLIVER
               Thought you knew your way around
               dark alleys, detective.

     Oliver goes through the swinging doors into the Examiner's
     room.  Charlie shoots Nick a look.  Nick let's it slide.


     INT.  MEDICAL EXAMINATION ROOM

     A TECHIE is showing the night's harvest to Charlie, Nick
     and Oliver.  They're standing over the body of the middle-
     aged Japanese man.

                         TECHIE
               ... The old man's suit was Japanese.
               The hitter's was Saville row.  No
               I.D.  We're doing a peel now.

     AT ANOTHER TABLE

     Another techie is carefully removing the skin from Number
     Two's fingertips.

     Charlie shuts his eyes and turns away, trying not to throw
     up.

                         TECHIE
               There's something you got to see.

     He whips back the sheet, the body is nude.  A towel covers
     the genitals.  Except for the feet, hands, neck, and face,
     the body is covered with elaborate tattoos:  flowers and
     blood, dragons and snakes.

                         TECHIE
               What's wrong with this picture?

                         CHARLIE
                    (nervously)
               I got a tattoo.  Birdie on the ball.
               We all got them when we finished
               basic at Camp Lejune.

                         NICK
               Charlie.

                         TECHIE
               I thought you guys were trained
               observers?

     They look up surprised.  The techie picks up a hand.  The
     third and forth fingers have been neatly amputated.

                         TECHIE
               Eight fingers.
                    (ironically)
               Hey, it was a trick question.

                                         CUT TO:

     INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM

     ABOLOFIA is seated in chair next to his LAWYER.  Nick,
     Oliver, and a third detective are grilling him.

                         ABOLOFIA
               He was with a friend, sure.  I shake
               hands with the guy and a minute
               later he's bleeding all over my
               socks.

                         ATTORNEY
               Will that do officers?  My client
               has had a terrible shock.

                         NICK
               Yeah, he's not used to seeing other
               people do the killing.

                         ATTORNEY
               I won't tolerate harassment!

                         OLIVER
               What about the package?

                         ATTORNEY
               We know nothing about it.

     Silence.  Abolofia looks at Nick, then at Oliver.

                         ABOLOFIA
               Hard to believe a trained police
               officer could let this kind of thing
               happen right in front of his face.

                         NICK
               I did make a mistake.  I let the
               wrong guy get hit.

     Abolofia doesn't blink an eye, goes for the jugular.

                         ABOLOFIA
               Cheer up, Nick.  I'm sure it's
               easier to pick a dead man's pocket.

     Nick springs from his feet.  Oliver grabs Nick before he
     can get close to Abolofia.

                         ATTORNEY
               That's it, we're through!

                                         CUT TO:

     KOBO

     the Japanese killer who smashed in Nick's face last night.
     He's sitting in an interrogation room an hour later with a
     DETECTIVE and a JAPANESE TRANSLATOR.  He won't talk.

     OBSERVATION ROOM

     Nick and Oliver watching through the glass.

                         OLIVER
               Doesn't speak a word of English.
               And he won't speak Japanese either.
               No papers.  The Japanese embassy is
               very interested.

                         NICK
               Why?

                         OLIVER
               He's wanted in Japan.  They want him
               first.  Then we can have him.

                         NICK
               What?

     Oliver nods.  That's the way it is.

     ON KOBO

     he turns and looks at Nick.  He can't possibly see him
     through the one way glass but he knows Nick's there.

     ON NICK

     looking at him.

     ON KOBO

     making a cutting mark across his forehead, right where
     Nick's bandage is.  It's uncanny.

                                         CUT TO:

     INT.  OLIVER'S OFFICE - LATER

     Nick is sitting in front of Oliver's desk.  The sunlight
     makes him wince; wincing makes his face hurt.

                         OLIVER
               Japanese embassy talks to state
               department.  State talks to police
               plaza.  They to me and me to you.
               Shit rolls down hill.

     Oliver drops a file folder on the desk.  Nick opens it:
     petty cash, vouchers and plane tickets.

                         OLIVER
               You and Charlie are taking the Jap
               home, tonight.

                         NICK
               What...?  What if I say no?

                         OLIVER
               Check your gun before you leave.
               They're not allowed in Japan.  It's
               a nice, safe country.

                         NICK
               Why me?

                         OLIVER
               They said send a detective if I
               could spare one.
                    (then)
               I can always spare you.

     Nick bridles at the insult.  Oliver's had a hard-on for
     Nick for years, and Nick's tired of it.

                         NICK
                    (soft)
               You got something to say to me,
               Captain?

     Oliver doesn't want to get into it.

                         OLIVER
               Yeah.  Have a wonderful flight.

     THE ORANGE SUN

     on the tail of a Japan Airlines 747.  A driving rain
     storm.  The plane taxies down the runway and disappears
     into the black rain.


     INT.  AIRLINER

     Kobo, handcuffed and shackled, is in the center seat.
     Nick and Charlie sit on either side.  Charlie is holding
     "Bachelors Japan" in one hand.  Nick's in a sour mood.

                         CHARLIE
               ... Nick, you're the one that's
               always saying you never go anywhere.

                         NICK
               I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie.
               Maybe Vegas.

                         CHARLIE
               What are you missing?  Riding your
               motorcycle to the nurse's house.
               That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.

                         NICK
               Beats forty hours on a plane.

                         CHARLIE
               They say we got to turn around and
               come right back.  That's what they
               say.  I got a plan.

     The last thing Nick wants to hear -- too late.

                         CHARLIE
               I call, right?  I say I got the
               dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits
               from some raw clam and we stretch it
               into three days.  You and I become a
               driving force on the local Geisha
               scene.

                         NICK
               Not a prayer.

                         CHARLIE
                    (grinning)
               Hey, come on, big guy like you, cop
               from New York.  You're gonna be the
               biggest thing to hit town since
               Godzilla.

     Nick can't help but smile at this kid.  Charlie looks down
     at the guide book.

                         CHARLIE
               Says here, it's very impolite to
               touch someone while you're talking
               to them...
                    (nudges Kobo)
               Guess that means you can't talk and
               screw at the same time, huh, hotdog?
               What's the matter, no -- speaky-the-
               language?  Understand this:  You
               will never ever fuck with my partner
               again.

     Nothing from Kobo who is looking straight ahead.  He
     doesn't understand.

                         NICK
               Shut-up, Charlie.

     A beat, then Charlie reads a Japanese phrase from the
     book.  A slight facial response from Kobo.  Charlie tries
     it again.  This time Kobo laughs openly.

                         NICK
               What'd you say?

                         CHARLIE
               Where is the subway station, please.

     Kobo keeps laughing; it's obviously not what Charlie said.

                         NICK
               Get a new book.

     INT.  AIRLINER - LATER

     The cabin is now darkened.  Kobo and Nick are asleep.  Not
     Charlie, he's still at his book, and listening to U2 on
     his Walkman.  Nick rolls over and opens his eyes to see
     Charlie watching him.  He shuts them hoping to avoid talk.
     Too late.

                         CHARLIE
               Nick... You up?

                         NICK
               No.

     Charlie removes his headphones.

                         CHARLIE
               Nick, have I been a good partner?

                         NICK
               Number five with a bullet.

     Nick shuts his eyes.

                         CHARLIE
               I just want you to know... I mean
               anybody who says you ever took has
               got to deal with me.

                         NICK
               Go to sleep, Charlie.

                         CHARLIE
               You didn't take, did you...?  You
               hear things.

     Nick opens his eyes.

                         NICK
               I worked the three nine in Queens,
               Charlie.

                    (surprised)
               I didn't know.

                         NICK
               The lieutenant was on the pad along
               with the rest of the squad.  I was
               new, didn't know shit.  When the
               feathers flew, I got called in front
               of the special prosecutor.  It's on
               the top of my personnel file.  They
               think I'm dirty or I cut a deal.
               Doesn't leave you with a lot of
               friends either way.

     Nick shuts his eyes.

                         NICK
               I might as well have done something.
               I've been paying for it every
               goddamn day since I got
               transferred...

     HOLD on Nick then...

     INT.  NARITA AIRPORT - JAPAN - DAY

     Nick and Charlie, with Kobo between them, are a strange
     sight in a sea of Japanese faces.  Kobo's hands are cuffed
     behind his back.  Nick also has Kobo cuffed to his wrist.
     The cops are rumpled, exhausted, showing two days of
     stubble.  Kobo looks sharp and wide awake.

     A pair of attractive teenage girls walks past them.

                         CHARLIE
               Whoa.  Nick, we're in paradise.

     A PAIR

     of white gloved hands belonging to a Tokyo police officer
     holds up a small, hand letter sign that says:
     CONKLIN/SKLOARIS.  The man holding the sign is NAGASHIMA.
     Two other police officers in spotless tan uniforms stand
     at his side.

     Nick, holding Kobo by his arm, steps up to the police and
     show his I.D.  Nagashima bows.

                         NAGASHIMA
               Officers Conklin and -- and...
                    (he can't say
                     Charlie's name)
               ... gentlemen, welcome.  I am
               assistant inspector Nagashima.

     They show their I.D.

                         NICK
               You going to take this crap off our
               hands?

                         NAGASHIMA
                    (confused)
               Crap...?  Oh, the prisoner.  Yes.

     He barks some orders to the officers who immediately take
     Kobo by the arms and put cuffs on him.  Nick unfastens
     his cuff when they're through.

     In contrast to Nagashima's gentility, the cops are rough
     with the prisoner.

                         CHARLIE
                    (extends his hand)
               Charlie.  Kon-ich-iwa.

     Nagashima shakes his hand.  Bows.  Charlie bows back.
     Nick wouldn't bow if his life depended on it.  Nagashima
     hands Nick an official looking document.

                         NAGASHIMA
               If you will please give this to the
               customs inspector he will expidate
               -- expedite you.  We have a car and
               a driver outside.

                         NICK
               Right.

                         CHARLIE
                    (bows)
               Arigato.

     Nick grabs Charlie by the arm and starts for the customs
     line.

                         NICK
               Givin' you a book is like givin' a

               In Rome, I'll bow.

     INT.  CUSTOMS BOOTH - DAY

     NICK and CHARLIE make their way through the crowd toward
     the head of a long line.  They dump their bags on the
     counter.  The INSPECTOR, furious that they have taken cuts
     in line, barks at them in Japanese.

                         NICK
               Inspector Nagashima told me to give
               you this.

     He hands the Inspector the official looking document.  The
     Inspector scans the paper.  Hands it back to them.

                         INSPECTOR
                    (broken English)
               You must get in line behind the
               rest.

                         NICK
               We're cops.  Pol-ice-men.

     The Inspector signals a nearby POLICEMAN.  The Inspector
     says something in Japanese.  Hands the policeman the
     document.  The policeman shakes his head, amused, points
     to the end of the line.

                         NICK
               Fellas, get serious.

     From off screen someone CALLS OUT:

                         MAN (O.S.)
               Nick!

     Nick and Charlie turn to see KOBO, their prisoner,
     standing on the other side of the thick plastic divider.
     The handcuffs are off.  The three alleged 'policemen' are
     heading out the door behind him.  It was a set-up:  Nick
     and Charlie have been had.

                         KOBO
                    (perfect English)
               Thanks for the ride, detective.

     He slowly backs away from the glass as if he had all the
     time in the world, finally disappearing in the crowd.

                                         CUT TO:

               Cops!  He's our prisoner!

     Two more policemen arrive.  Nick and Charlie are thrown up
     against the wall.  Out come the cuffs.  SNAP!

     INT.  TOKYO POLICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

     Fifty identical desks.  Fifty identical phones.  Fifty
     identically dressed men in white shirts and ties working
     under the fluorescent lights of this large open room.

     We GLIDE PAST the rows of desk to find INSPECTOR OHASHI,
     mid forties, sitting behind a perfectly arranged desk.
     Ohashi prides himself on order.

     Nick and Charlie are standing in front of him.

                         NICK
               Get me something like an Identi-Kit
               and I'll give you a description.

     Ohashi remains poker faced.  He continues to arrange
     papers and apply his hanko (personal seal) to the bottom
     of a stack of official papers.

                         CHARLIE
               There must be some witnesses from
               the airport?

     Still nothing from the good inspector.

                         NICK
               What is it, tea time?

     Still nothing from Ohashi.  Finally:

                    (quiet rage)
               You lost a man we wanted for some
               time.  It was very incompetent on
               your part, officer.

                         NICK
               Incompetent is letting people waltz
               through a secure area wearing your
               uniforms, carrying official
               documents.

     Ohashi bows slightly, we're not sure why.

                         NICK
               I want a gun.

                         OHASHI
               It is not allowed.

                         NICK

               Work with me.  I want your best
               detective.

     Pause.  Ohashi returns to his papers.  Nick can't believe
     it.

                         NICK
               Hey, inspector, I don't intend to
               take the rap for this.

                         OHASHI
                    (not looking up)
               Do you know what this is?

     Ohashi holds up the document that was handed to Nick at
     the airport.

                         OHASHI
               It's a laundry list.  Go home,
               detective.

     Nick studies him for a beat, then turns away.  To Charlie:

                         NICK
               Let's go.

                         CHARLIE
               Nick, we can't just --

                         NICK
               I said let's go, Charlie.

     Reluctantly they head towards the door, passing long rows
     of bureaucrats, telephones ringing off the hook.  Nick
     stops at the door, spots a fuse box nearby.  He glances
     back to make sure no one is looking.

     Nick pulls out his handcuffs.  Charlie can't figure out
     what the hell he's doing.  Nick attaches one cuff to the
     main lever then yanks it down.

     The lights go out.  The fan's stop; so do the typewriters;
     so does the air conditioning.  Dead silence.

     Nick attaches the other cuff to a pipe, snaps it shut.
     Now it's impossible to left the main lever.

     From the far end of the room:

                         OHASHI
               What are you doing?!

     Nick drops the key down the water fountain drain.

                         NICK
               Your best detective, Ohashi.

                         CHARLIE
               First decent idea you've had.

     Charlie pulls out his 'Footloose in Tokyo" book, flips
     through the pages.

                         CHARLIE
               Food... Food, here we go.  Tokyo
               offers a wide variety of food.  It's
               best to sample the local
               specialties, including sashaimi,
               soba, and world renown Kobe beef...

     Nick goes into a restaurant.  Charlie drops the book,
     disgusted with Nick's choice.  Charlie reluctantly follows
     him in.  REVEAL it's a Shakey's Pizza restaurant.

     Rows of post-modern buildings of odd shaped windows and

     searching for the Japanese cop's building.  They can't
     speak the language; they can't read the signs; and half
     the buildings don't have numbers.  It's a nightmare.

                         CHARLIE
               This should be it...

     It's unlocked.

     A four tatami room.  An unholy mess:  Food packages, beer
     bottles, stacks of papers and file folders.  Framed

               I hope not.

     A WOMAN now appears at the door.  Middle aged, wizened
     face, in a full traditional Kimono.

                         CHARLIE
               Konichiwa.  Ichiro Matsumoto?

     The woman babbles bird-like in rapid Japanese.  She bows.
     They're in the right place.

                                         CUT TO:

     EXT.  SIDE STREET - MINIMAI MURAMATSU - NIGHT

     The jammed streets are barely wide enough to get a
     motorcycle down.  It's a bad neighborhood, one of the
     poorest in Tokyo.

     We spot the small kimono clad WOMAN, clip-clopping on
     wooden geta, leading Nick and Charlie through this
     labyrinth.

                         CHARLIE
                    (looking around)
               Getting very weird.

                         NICK
               I'd feel better if we had some heat.

                         CHARLIE
               Maybe we should bail?

     Seeing they've stopped, the woman gestures for them to
     hurry up, then disappears around the corner.

                         NICK
                    (looking at the maze
                     of streets)
               Think we could find our way back?

                                         CUT TO:

     A GARISH PINK SIGN - PINK SARON BAR

     A poor man's idea of a bar.  The woman points inside,
     chirps away in Japanese, bows, then hurries off leaving
     Nick and Charlie on their own.

     INSIDE PINK SARON

     Nick and Charlie disappear into darkness as the woven
     flaps shut behind them.  A vintage wurlitzer juke box
     glows across the room.  An Enka plays.  (Haunting Japanese
     blues.)

                         MAN'S VOICE (FROM THE DARKNESS)
               Big shots from New York.  I like
               your style!

     ICHIRO MATSUMOTO steps into a pool of light just inches
     from them.  He is a short overweight man looking every
     minute of his fifty-five years.  His white short sleeve
     shirt is too tight; his narrow tie spotted in the middle;
     his collar soaked in sweat.  He's not drunk yet, but he's
     been at it a while.  Call him Ich.

                         ICH
                    (bowing)
               Detective Ichiro Matsumoto.  I'm the
               man you're looking for.

     This is Ohashi's best man?  Well, at least he speaks
     English.

                         ICH
               The man you are looking for, Kobo,
               was a member of the Samaguchi-gummi.
               A Yakuza.

     Ich nods, offers them what's left of his Sapphoro beer.
     They shake their heads.  Ich finishes it.

                         NICK
               Where do we start looking for this
               guy?

                         ICH
               Where would you look for the mafia?

                         CHARLIE
               The back room at Lombardi's after
               the Columbus Day Parade.  Under the
               bed.  In the mayor's office.
               Everywhere.

     Ich heads for the door without saying a word.

                         NICK
               Where're you going, Ichiro?

                         ICH
                    (stops, faces them)
               The mayor's office, under the bed,
               the back room at Lombardi's.
                    (tucking in his
                     shirt tail)
               And call me Ich.

     INT.  ICHIBANKAN BAR BUILDING - KABUKI CHO - NIGHT

     Imagine an ultra modern indoor shopping mall, except there
     aren't any stores.  The only product sold here is
     pleasure:  Bars, hostess clubs, Turkish baths.  A post-
     modern red light district with music piped in and
     automated doormen.


     INT.  LAS VEGAS WELCOME CLUB

     Hip, younger Japanese are wedged together at the long
     chrome bar.  The GUYS sport leather jackets and Raybans.
     The GIRLS are decked out in fifties American party dresses
     and short cropped hair.  Jerry Lee Lewis wails in the
     background.

     Nick, Ich and Charlie are at one end of the long bar.  Ich
     is drinking them both under the table.

                         ICH
                    (singing)
               "Goodness, gracious, great balls of
               fire."
                    (raising glass for
                     toast)
               To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis.

                         NICK
                    (checking his watch)
               Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo
               And The Don't's.  Let's book,
               Charlie.  If he starts on Motown,
               we'll be here all night.

                         ICH
               No, this is the place for the young
               Yakuza.

                         NICK
               That's what you said in the last
               three piss pots.

     Ich sets down his drink, pours more sake for Nick and
     Charlie then for himself.  He's having a great time.

                         ICH
               I love you people.  The music, the
               clothes, the movies... Japanese
               respect only what is Japanese.

     Nick glances at Charlie.

                         NICK
               It's incredible.  Hit him or
               something.

                         CHARLIE
               I don't think he'd feel it.

                         ICH
                    (beginning to slur
                     his words)
               Americans change everything.  When I
               was young the city was wood and
               paper... I was ten when the bombers
               came.  I lived underground for three
               days.  When I came up, the city was
               gone... A ball of fire.

     Nick gets to his feet.  Ich grabs him by the arm, stopping
     him.

                         ICH
               It began to rain, Nick.  You know
               what color the rain was?

     Ich doesn't give him a chance to answer.

                         ICH
               Black... It was black from the ash.
               Very impressive.  You Americans, you
               could make black rain.

     Ich polishes off his drink.  An awkward silence.  Charlie,
     wanting to lighten the mood --

                         CHARLIE
                    (leaning close)
               Say Ich, between friends, where can
               I grab some squish around here?

     Nick sighs, digs in his pocket for some yen for the bill.

                         ICH
               Squid?

                         CHARLIE
               Pussy, ass, soft personnel.

     Ich looks up to see a picturesque, blood-haired American
     WOMEN in a tight silk blouse and skirt.  She works here
     and has obviously heard Charlie.

                         ICH
               Ah, Joyce...
                    (in Japanese)
               How are you tonight?

                         JOYCE
                    (in Japanese)
               Hello, Ich.  Johnny Walker?

     Ich nods.  Joyce's Japanese is impeccable.  She's a part-
     time bartender, translator, model.  One of Japan's western
     wanderers.  She's sliding past thirty, but only her weary
     eyes give it away.  She is about to pour Ich another
     drink.

                         NICK
               Don't give him any more.

                         JOYCE
               He gets as much as he wants.

     Charlie extends his hand to Joyce.  She ignores it.

                         CHARLIE
               Hello hello, Charlie Skloaris.  New
               York City.

     She refills Ich's glass.

                         CHARLIE
               My partner and I are cops.
                    (lowering his voice)
               We're on a very big assignment here.
                    (nothing from Joyce)
               When do you get off?

                         JOYCE
               Right when you're being tucked into
               bed.

     Cold.

                         ICH
               You should be nicer to my American
               friends, Joyce.

                         JOYCE
               They wouldn't appreciate it, Ich.
               Trust me.

     She says something in Japanese to Ich as she eyes the
     cops.  Then, she walks off.

                         ICH
               Joyce can be nice.

                         CHARLIE
                    (brightening)
               What'd she say?

                         ICH
                    (big smile)
               That I should let you pay for the
               drinks.
                    (raising his glass)
               Kampai.

     EXT.  ICHIBANKAN BAR BUILDING - NIGHT

     Charlie and Nick are trying to help a besotted Ich find a
     taxi, but no one will take him.  Ich is shouting half
     English, half Japanese phrases.

                         ICH
               ... We got to keep looking.  Track
               him down!  Great balls of fire!

                         NICK
                    (frustrated, to a
                     cabbie)
               What's the problem here?

     The cabbie ignores them.

                         WOMAN (O.S.)
               You don't speak the language.  I'll
               drop him off.

     They turn to see Joyce standing behind them.

                         ICH
               Ah, Joyce...

     The rest is slurred Japanese.  Joyce speaks to a cabbie in
     Japanese.  The rear door swings open.  She helps Ich in.
     Joyce climbs in.

                         ICH
                    (out the window)
               See you tomorrow!

     The taxi pulls away.  Nick and Charlie watch it go.

                         NICK
               Not a prayer.

                                         CUT TO:

     EXT.  STREET - FOUR A.M.

     An early morning wind jostles the red paper lantern and
     plucks at the tails of dragon-like banners hanging outside
     the shops.  Nick and Charlie are walking down this narrow
     sidestreet on the way back to their hotel.

                         CHARLIE
               ... He's a sorry old guy, but I like
               him.

                         NICK
               He couldn't find his ass with both
               hands.

     A brand new Kawasaki 1000 motorcycle with windshield and
     full farings gleams under a street light.

                         CHARLIE
               Now that's the kind of motorcycle I
               want to see you on.

                         NICK
                    (muttering)
               Sure, a rice burning crotch
               rocket...

                         CHARLIE
               Nick, how we gonna bag this guy
               without any help?  Maybe I should
               work on that girl Joyce, she speaks
               the language.

     Nick glances over at his partner, smiles.  But before he
     can respond --

     The DULL ROAR of a half dozen motorcycles in the distance
     breaks the pre-dawn stillness.

     TWENTY BOSOZOKU (BIKERS)

     on their multi-cylinder high tech street bombers, creep
     around the corner and slowly ride toward Nick and Charlie.

     We get a better look at them:  turbo punk Elvis-samurai
     hybrids -- some wearing a slipper under their headbands,
     courtesy of their girlfriends; some in leopard skin pants.
     And tattoos...

     They head straight for Nick and Charlie, then, at the last
     moment, split and float away IN SLOW MOTION, as if the
     cops didn't exist.

     Suddenly, the street is empty again.  Silent except for
     the SOUND of the wind beating against paper lanterns,
     rustling the wind chimes...

     Hold on Nick and Charlie standing in the middle of the
     street, realizing just how far away from home they are.

                                         DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT.  HOTEL - THE NEXT MORNING

     A rocket shaped building:  a mixture of Dutch Gable and
     Japanese Minka roof.  The mid-day sun beats down on a
     particular room.


     INT.  HOTEL ROOM

     Nick and Charlie are sacked out.  They never bothered to
     pull the curtains.  THE SOUND OF KNOCKING at the door.

                         ICH (O.S.)
               Nick!

                         NICK
               Give us a break...

                         ICH (O.S.)
               It's Ichiro.  Ich.

                         NICK
               Leave the rice cake outside and go
               home!

     But Ich persists.

     AT THE DOOR

     As Nick opens up.  Ich bows.  He's now clean shaven and
     has put on a clean shirt.

                         ICH
               There's been a murder.  Yakuza.  You
               should come.

                                         CUT TO:

     INT.  PRINTING PLANT - DAY

     The murder scene.  NO SOUND.

     A SERIES OF SHOTS:

     A BODY FROM THE WAIST DOWN in the claws of six foot
     working robotic.  The tattooed covered legs swing back and
     forth like a pendulum.

     THE TORSO is wedged in between two enormous printing
     rollers.

     THE HEAD is resting in the middle of a conveyer belt.
     It's been drenched in black printer's ink which has begun
     to congeal.

     WE SLOWLY TRACK PAST Ich, Charlie, and Nick, watching.
     Charlie has the dry heaves.

     REAL SOUND as we reveal the full crime scene.  Instead of
     the usual cigar smoke, camera flashes and radio chatter,
     there is order and quiet.  A slow underwater dance.

     INSPECTOR OHASHI

     quietly gives an order.  Someone turns off the robotic.
     The severed legs stop swinging.

     Nick, Charlie and Ich walk over to Ohashi.  Ich bows
     deeply.  Ohashi doesn't acknowledge any of them, talks to
     a man holding a tape measurer.

                         NICK
               Could you fill me in?

                         OHASHI
               Why don't you ask your chief
               detective?

     Ich looks down at the floor.

                         NICK
               Because I want you to tell me.

                         OHASHI
               The young are eating the old,
               something that usually doesn't
               happen here.

                         NICK
               Can we skip the poetry, inspector?

     Ohashi pauses.  Ich looks at Nick as if to warn him he
     can't speak to Ohashi that way.

                         OHASHI
               There's a war, detective, between
               two rival groups.  The man who
               escaped, Kobo, leads the younger
               group.  They did this.

                         ICH
               Kobo's a wild boy.  He was a
               lieutenant in the Sammaguchi-gummi.

                         OHASHI
                    (in Japanese)
               Excellent, Officer Matsumoto.  How
               is your investigation going?

                         ICH
                    (in Japanese)
               Well, sir.  Thank you for giving me
               the opportunity to work with these
               distinguished gentlemen.

     He bows.  It's pathetic.

                         POLICE LIEUTENANT
               Looking for clues in the bottom of a
               sake bottle, Matsumoto?

     Laughter all around.

                         OHASHI
               He's an officer of great
               distinction.

     Another sarcastic dig.  Ich stoically stands and takes it.

                         CHARLIE
               Hey, Ich has been helpful.

                         OHASHI
                    (ignoring him, to
                     Nick)
               Have you changed your mind and
               decided to go home, detective?

                         NICK
               Not until one of us bags Kobo.
                    (looking at the
                     corpse)
               And it doesn't look like you're
               doing so hot.

     Ohashi coolly flicks the ashes of his cigarette and we --

                                         CUT TO:

     EXT.  PRINTING PLANT - DAY

     Ich, Nick, and Charlie are threading their way through the
     crowd toward the subway entrance.

     TWO BIKERS, their hair slicked back, watch the trio from
     the top of two different subway entrances.

     As soon as Ich, Nick and Charlie go down the steps, they
     climb off their bikes and follow.


     INT.  SUBWAY STATION

     Nick, Ich and Charlie are riding the people mover that
     stretches the length of this endless tunnel.  They're
     sandwiched between the legions of SALARYMEN (white collar
     workers) who all wear identical blue suits and white
     shirts.

     Nick looks over at Ich, who is still suffering in silence
     from the recent humiliation.

                         NICK
               You know, Inspector, you take shit
               once, you take shit forever.

                         ICH
                    (beat)
               I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.

                         NICK
               Why the hell not?

                         ICH
               I don't, that's all.

     Ich looks away, obviously uncomfortable.

                         CHARLIE
               You cool, Ich?

                         ICH
               Cool?

                         CHARLIE
               You all right?  You okay?

     Ich nods.

                         CHARLIE
               What does Ichiro mean, anyway?

                         ICH
                    (smiling)
               What does Charlie mean?

                         CHARLIE
               Hey, all right.

     Charlie slaps Ich on the back.

     NICK smiles at Charlie's remark.  He can't help but like
     this wide-eyed goofy kid.

     Something makes Nick's smile fade.

     NICK'S POV

     KOBO, their escaped prisoner, hurrying in the opposite
     direction.  His Kamali suit looks like it just came from
     the cleaners.

                         NICK
               Charlie!

     Charlie spots him.  In a flash, the two men jump the
     railing and charge after him, leaving Ich in their wake.

     Ich can't possibly make it over the side.  He furiously
     shoves his way through the Salarymen, trying to get to the
     end of the walkway.

     CHASE SEQUENCE

     -- Nick barreling through the mass of faceless Salarymen.

     -- Kobo, hurrying ahead, occasionally glancing back.

     -- Charlie catching up to Nick.  They've lost him.  They
        spin around.  A half dozen tunnels spin out in all
        directions.

     -- Nick and Charlie spotting Kobo.  He's waiting for them
        near the turnstile.

     Nick suddenly realizes it's a set-up.  Before he can say
     anything, Charlie sprints ahead, recklessly shoving
     people out of the way.

                         NICK
                    (calling after him)
               It's a set-up...!  Charlie!

     Charlie hasn't heard him.

     AT THE TURNSTILE

     Kobo hands a ticket to the turnstile guard and disappears
     onto the platform.  Charlie doesn't have a ticket.  The
     guard points to the automatic ticket machine.  Screw it.
     Charlie leaps over the turnstile.

     The GUARD blows his shrill whistle to signal the subway
     police.

     THE PLATFORM

     Charlie pushes through the crowd -- a wall of blank faces.
     Kobo is gone.

     NICK

     shoving through the crowd.  He spots Charlie.  Shouts at
     him to wait.  Charlie can't hear his partner.

     THE SUBWAY

     pulls in.  An immaculately uniformed CONDUCTOR blows his
     whistle and waves his white-gloved hands to keep the crowd
     back.

     A LEATHER JACKETED BOY shoves Charlie from behind; he
     stumbles forward toward the track.  Someone catches him at
     the last moment.  Charlie turns around to see it's Kobo.

     Kobo smiles, it's all a big joke.

     What follows happens in a flash:

     ON NICK

                         NICK
               Charlie!

     Nick is close enough to see, too far to do anything.  He's
     blocked by TWO MORE LEATHER BOYS.  He tries to shove past,
     but they grab him.

     KOBO

     holding Charlie by his coat lapels.  An express train
     tears into the station.  Kobo casually glances at

     NICK

     trying to struggle free.

     KOBO

     his eyes still on Nick, drops Charlie in front of the
     speeding express as if he were a sack of laundry.

     NICK

                         NICK
               NO!!

     A woman SCREAMS.

     The train barrels through the station.

     Kobo starts toward Nick.  He's next.

     A pair of SUBWAY POLICEMEN burst through the crowd
     searching for Charlie because he vaulted the turnstile.

     NICK

     manages to break free of the leatherboys holding him.
     They flee into the crowd as the police close in.

     ACROSS THE PLATFORM - KOBO

     slips into the wave of commuters being shoved into a
     train by white-gloved MEN.  It's their job to shove
     commuters into the already packed cars.

     Nick goes for Kobo, but the crowd closes in front of him.
     He can't get through.

     THE SUBWAY DOORS

     slam shut.  The train pulls out leaving Nick standing on
     the empty platform.

     THE LAST CAR

     streaks past him.  Kobo stands in the rear window, getting
     smaller and smaller until the train disappears down the
     tracks.

                         ICH
               Nick!

     Ich, out of breath, is standing on the platform.  Nick
     looks at him with disgust -- where the hell was he.

     STAY on Nick, his head bowed, being surrounded by the sea
     of blue-suited commuters.

                                         FADE TO WHITE.

     FADE IN:

     NICK'S FACE against a white wall.  That's all we see.
     Ohashi's voice OFF SCREEN.

                         OHASHI (O.S.)
               ... You ignored me.  I don't care
               about what you want.  Get on a
               plane, detective Conklin.  Go home.

     We HEAR a door open and SLAM shut off screen.  Hold on
     Nick, frozen in place, then:

                                         CUT TO:

     INT.  CENTRAL SECTION - TOKYO POLICE H.Q. - DAY

     Again, the fifty desks, fifty faceless men working.
     Typewriters CLACKING, phones RINGING.  We MOVE down the
     rows to find Nick sitting behind one of the desks.  He's
     on the phone to New York.

                         OLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE)
               It's not your job.

                         NICK
               He was my partner.

                         OLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE)
               They're blaming it on you.  Christ,
               Conklin, you didn't even tell me you
               lost the prisoner!

                         NICK
               I planned on catching him, Captain.

                         OLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE)
               How?  You don't know the place.  You
               don't know the language.  Get on the
               plane.

                         NICK
               He killed a police officer.

                         OLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE)
               Your plane's at nine a.m.  Be on it.
               That's orders.  Period.

     Oliver hangs up.  A moment of long distance hum cross
     talk.  Nick doesn't move.  Pull back through the rows of
     cops busily working... SOUND FADES.

     Charlie Parker's alto sax FADE UP as we --

                                         CUT TO:

     EXT.  SHINJUKU - NIGHT

     The MUSIC continues.  The sax screams as the melody is
     abandoned.

     Nick is drunk.  Roaring angry drunk.  He doesn't know
     where he is.  He doesn't care.  He plows down the street,
     occasionally grabbing a passerby, then letting them go.

     Nick begins to laugh.  A couple is staring at him, Nick
     yells at them, but we DON'T HEAR HIM.  He stumbles on...
     drop back to find.

     ICH

     following in his wake.  He bows and apologizes to the
     offended.

                                         CUT TO:

     EXT.  LAS VEGAS WELCOME BAR - NIGHT

     Nick is thrown onto the street.  He tries to reenter and
     is thrown out again.  We spot JOYCE inside watching; she
     turns back to her customers.


     EXT.  GINZA - NIGHT

     Nick is hassling a news vendor who pointedly ignores him
     and continues selling his papers.  Ich appears and
     apologizes to the news vendor.


     EXT.  STREET - TWO A.M.

     Nick's sitting on the curb, his head in his hands.  People
     step around him.

     Across the street, out of Nick's sight, Ich is watching
     his partner, feeling every barb of Nick's shame.

     Charlie Parker continues over the slow...

                                         DISSOLVE TO:

     NICK --

     asleep, the futon tangled around him.  He opens his eyes.
     A woman is making tea in the kitchenette.  This is the
     kimonoed woman who led Nick and Charlie to Ich the other
     night.

     A RADIO is on softly in the background.  The Charlie
     Parker tune we've been listening to over the previous cuts
     ends, and the announcer comes on:

                         RADIO
               ... That was the Bird, from the Blue
               Note years.  1230 hours and 72
               degrees in central Osaka.  This is
               specialist Doug Dale, Tapestries in
               Jazz, on the Far East Network, armed
               forces radio...

     Nick slowly sits up to see

     ICH

     seated at a low table looking at him from across the room.

     Nick spots his clothes and luggage stacked in the corner.
     Nick now realizes he's in Ich's apartment.  It's spotless.
     Everything is now in its proper place.

                         NICK
               What happened?

                         ICH
               They made you leave your hotel...
                    (looks away)
               ... you caused a disturbance.

     Nick's eyes fall on Charlie's things:  his sports clothes,
     his tour book, his shoes which Ich has stacked on the
     table.

                         ICH
               It may be too soon to talk about it.
               When someone we care for dies we...
                    (beat)
               ... keep something of their's.  A
               tie, a pen.

                         NICK
               Why weren't you at the platform?

                         ICH
               I couldn't keep up.  My shame is
               complete.

     Nick slowly shuts his eyes, his head pounding.

                                         CUT TO:

     INT.  PUBLIC BATH - DAY

     The neighborhood bathhouse.  Thick with steam and
     neighborhood kids.

     Nick walks toward the huge pool of water.  Ich is beside
     him.  Nick's about to climb in when Ich stops him, hands
     him a pail and a washcloth and points to the faucets along
     the wall where a dozen men squat on small stools as they
     wash themselves.

                                         CUT TO:

     NICK

     as he pours a pail of water over his head, it runs down
     his face in slow motion.

                                         CUT TO:

     THE POOL

     Nick soaking, on one side.  Ich is soaking nearby.

                         ICH
               You must leave?

                         NICK
               Yeah...

                         ICH
               I'll get him for you, Nick.

     Nick looks at this thick bellied, alcoholic cop.  Not a
     very reassuring thought.

     TWO MEN carrying plastic pails cross in front of the tub.
     Young, muscular Yakuza, their bodies covered with
     exquisite tattoos.  They stare openly at Nick.  One makes
     a joke.  Both laugh obscenely as they slip into the hot
     tub.

                         NICK
               Yakuza?

     Ich nods.  Nick eyes them for a long beat, then climbs out
     of the tub.

                                         CUT TO:

     NICK

     Nick tossing two bags into a taxi in front of Ich's
     apartment building.

     ICH

     Ich watching Nick through the window from inside his
     apartment.  He glances back and sees Charlie's "Members
     Only" coat hanging on a hook.

     When he turns back, Nick's taxi has disappeared.


     EXT.  NARITA AIRPORT

     The brightest object in the frame is a yellow forklift
     carrying a jostling aluminum coffin toward the open belly
     of the cargo plane.  Nick watches it from the edge of the
     tarmac.

     AIRPORT CHECK IN GATE

     Nick hands the clerk his ticket.

                         NICK
               ... Smoking.

                         CLERK
               Aisle or window?

     Nick spots a folded newspaper someone has left on the
     counter.  He can't read it, of course, but there's a
     picture of the subway platform where Charlie was killed,
     swarming with police.  Nick continues to stare at the
     paper.

                         CLERK
               Aisle or window, sir?

                         NICK
                    (looks up)
               I want to cash it in.  Yen.

                                         CUT TO:

     ICH'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Nick steps in, drops the two suitcases.

                         NICK
               Ichiro?

     The woman steps out of the kitchen, babbles something in
     Japanese.  Nick doesn't have a clue.

                                         CUT TO:

     INT.  LAS VEGAS WELCOME BAR - AFTERNOON

     Only a handful of patrons.  Joyce is straightening bottles
     behind the bar.

                         NICK (O.S.)
               What's tricks?

     She looks up, surprised to see Nick standing in front of
     her.

                         JOYCE
               Ich said you left.

                         NICK
               There was a change in plans.

     Beat.

                         JOYCE
               I'm sorry about your friend.

     Nick's surprised at how fast she heard.

                         JOYCE
               Dead gaiijin's are big news.

                         NICK
               Gaiijin?

                         JOYCE
               An outside person.  A foreigner.  A
               barbarian.  You, me.
                    (beat)
               More you.

                         NICK
               I could use some help.  Show me
               around.  I'll pay you for your time.

                         JOYCE
               I don't give tours.

     Nick smiles.

                         NICK
               You can count on the truth from
               people who don't like you.

                         JOYCE
               You have a helluva way of asking for
               help.

                         NICK
               You have a helluva way of answering.

     Draw.

                         JOYCE
               Look, you need Ich.  I've been here
               five years and I still can't read
               all the street signs.

                         NICK
               Maybe I'm a quicker learner.

                         JOYCE
               I don't think so.

     From OFF SCREEN:

                         ICH (O.S.)
               Nicklaus-san.

     Nick turns to see Ich, leaning against the door frame.
     He's already had a few drinks too many.  He's delighted to
     see Nick.

                         ICH
               I've continued working on the case!

                         NICK
               I can see that.

     Ich ambles into the room, slips down into a chair.  He
     spills the contents of the large manila envelope he's been
     carrying onto the table:  a wallet, a set of keys, playing
     cards, etc.

                         ICH
                    (signaling to Joyce)
               Joyce... A drink please.
                    (to Nick)
               Kobo has disappeared.  My superiors
               don't trust me.

     Nick walks over to the table and looks at the items.

                         ICH
               Kobo's.  Taken off him when he was
               arrested in New York.

     Nick sits down.  Joyce gives Ich his scotch.

                         ICH
               I knew you'd come back.  You feel
               you have a debt you can never pay.
               But you will, even if it costs you
               your life.  Giri.  Honor.

     Nick picks up various items off the table.

                         NICK
               How'd you get this?

                         ICH
               I stole them.

     Ich drapes his arm over Nick's shoulder.

                         ICH
               Partners, Nicklaus-san?

     Ich reaches for his drink.  Nick gets there first.  He
     holds it up as if he were proposing a toast, then
     purposefully spills his drink out.

                         NICK
               Partners.

     Ich has just had his last drink on duty.

     All the contents of the envelope are spread out on the

     choice clipping from Screw magazine, sugarless gum, cuff
     links...

     Nick's holding up a series of photos.

     CLOSE ON PHOTO

     of a naked women and Kobo screwing on a Tatami mat.
     Another photo.  Then another.  Each photo is more
     pornographic than the next.

     Joyce picks them up as Nick sets them down.

                         JOYCE
               Busy man.

     Nick holds out several of the same girl in various poses.

     INT.  PACHINKO PARLOR - DAY

     The largest in Tokyo.  Endless rows of men sitting in
     front of the machines (horizontal pinball games) furiously
     punching the flippers.  The NOISE from the metal balls is
     deafening.

     A MAN

     in a Hawaiian shirt, his arms covered with tattoos, is
     starting a new game.

     Ich moves up to the vacant machine beside him, puts in his
     change.  Ich doesn't face the man as they speak in
     Japanese.  The man in the Hawaiian shirt walks off.

     ON NICK

     as the man in the Hawaiian shirt walks past him.  This is
     the snitch.  Nick glances back at Ich.  Ich nods --
     they're in business.

     A CRAMPED ROOM - REAR OF PACHINKO PARLOR

     We HEAR the clattering of the machines outside.  The man
     in the Hawaiian shirt, mid-fifties and badly in need of a
     shower, is sitting on the floor studying the photos.  Ich
     and Nick tower above him.

     The man says something to Nick in Japanese, then continues
     to study the photos.

                         NICK
               What's he saying?

                         ICH
                    (looking up)
               He says they're very nice.  He wants
               to know if you have anymore.

     Nick sighs.

                         ICH
               I'll ask him again.

     Ich asks in Japanese.  The man shrugs.

                         NICK
               My turn.

     He grabs the man by his shirt collar and shoves him
     against the wall.  The photos spill to the floor.

                         NICK
               Who is she?

     He bangs the man's head back against the wall.  The man
     starts babbling in Japanese.

     Ich, horrified, tries to pull Nick off him.

                         ICH
               Nick, stop.

     Nick bangs the snitches head against the wall again.  Ich
     gets Nick away.  The man is terrified.

                         ICH
               This man must be treated with
               respect.

     Ich bows to the man, apologizes in Japanese.

                         NICK
               Aw, for Christ's sake.

     They continue speaking in Japanese.  They bow to one
     another again.  Ich gives the man a glass of water, then
     motions for him to sit down.

     Nick, impatient, starts for the guy again.  Ich stops him.
     The snitch holds up one of the photos, and starts
     babbling.

     is struggling with his chopsticks and bowl of noodles.
     From O.S. A LOUD SLURPING SOUND.  The sound stops, then
     starts again.  Nick can't eat.  He sets his bowl down and
     looks over at

     ICH

     slurping his noodles.  It is considered polite to slurp
     soba noodles as loud as possible.

     Ich stops.  Looks at Nick, then resumes his slurping.

                         NICK
               Think you could keep it to a dull
               roar?

     They're sitting by the window across from the Seibu
     department store watching the entrance.

                         ICH
               It's good manners.

     Nick nods.  Picks up his bowl.  Again the LOUD slurping
     off screen.  Nick starts to eat the noodles.  He can't
     continue with Ich slurping.  He sets the bowl down.

     Ich grins, resumes slurping and we --

     acknowledgement between them.


     EXT.  STREET CAR STATION

     There are dozens of street cars waiting to pull out.  The
     girl is on one of them.  Ich has lost her.  Nick and Ich
     hurry from car to car.

     They spot the girl sitting in the window of one of the
     street cars, about to turn onto the main street.

     The two cops race for the car.  Nick leaps on.  Ich is a
     few steps behind.  Nick sticks out his hand, pulls Ich up.

     T-shirts, he finds:

               Not too shabby for a perfume pusher.

                                         CUT TO:

     THE SHINZOA DISTRICT - NIGHT

     The girl, on the move, pushing through the crowd.  Drop
     back to find Ich twenty yards behind.  She crosses the
     street.  Nick, pretending to be looking in a store window,
     picks her up.

     AROUND THE CORNER

     Nick has lost her.  It's a cul de sac with a dozen
     buildings.  He's standing in the middle of the street.
     Ich catches up to him.

                         NICK
               She disappeared... shit!

                         ICH
               You were too far behind.

     Nick does a double-take.

                         ICH
                    (recalling Nick's
                     words)
               Don't say anything more.  Don't do
               anything.  And, for Christ's sake,
               don't apologize!

                                         DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT.  STREET - SHINZOA DISTRICT - NIGHT - LATER

     NICK

     dropping another cigarette butt to the ground.  There's a
     small pile at his feet.  He's leaning against the wall
     watching one end of the block.  TRACK over to reveal Ich,
     his back to Nick's, watching the other end.

     Ich glances back at Nick.  Nick ignores him.  Ich turns
     back.

                         ICH
               Nicklaus-san!

     Nick turns to see the GIRL walk out of a bath house.
     She's wearing her ponytail again, with a black dress.  She
     climbs into a taxi.

                                         CUT TO:

     EXT.  PINK SARON HOSTESS CLUB - NIGHT

     The girl climbs out of the taxi and goes inside.

     Nick and Ich are watching from across the street.


     INT.  HOSTESS CLUB

     Packed with Salarymen from the nearby brewery and
     hostesses in silk dresses selling cheap champagne at
     expensive prices.

     NICK AND ICH

     Walk in.  Everything seems normal.

     The BOUNCER in a white tux, stops them.  This is not a
     place frequented by Gaiijin.

     Ich beseeches the Bouncer to let his good friend in,
     promising that his friend will spend lots of money.

     Nick, thinking he's in, takes a step forward.  The Bouncer
     shoves him back.

                         NICK
               Hey, no hands, huh?

     He bats his hands away.  Ich grabs Nick by the shoulders,
     preventing a fight.

                         ICH
               You can't come in.  They don't
               want --

                         NICK
               Gaiijin.

                         ICH
               I'll check it out.

     Nick, unsure, turns to go, but before he does:

                         NICK
               If I smell one drop of Scotch on
               your breath, my friend --

                         ICH
               You can trust me.

     Nick hesitates, he's not so sure, then shoves the door
     open.


     EXT.  HOSTESS CLUB

     Nick waiting under the pink neon sign.


     INT.  HOSTESS CLUB - LATER

     Ich is sitting at the crowded bar.  A HOSTESS has her arm
     around his neck.  He checks out the room, searching for
     the girl.  He notices two THUGS standing outside a sliding
     door.  Ich finishes his drink.

                         ICH
                    (in Japanese)
               Let me up.

                         HOSTESS
                    (shoving him down)
               Sit, sweetie.
                    (to bartender)
               Another Seagrams!

     Ich relents.  Then, spotting something across the room:

     WHAT HE SEES:  A rice paper door slides open, momentarily
     revealing a DOZEN men with close cropped hair sitting on
     tatami mats, playing poker.  Some have their coats off,
     revealing arms covered with tattoos.  Yakuza.

     A hostess, serving drinks, steps but leaving the door
     partially open.

     The hostess slides the door open to the adjacent room, but
     Ich CANNOT see inside.  She slides it shut.

     Ich's hostess wants him to buy another drink, but Ich
     shakes his head, gets to his feet, and pretending to be
     drunk, stumbles toward the sliding doors.

     Ich bumps into a table; slaps a stranger on the shoulder;
     then starts singing along with Frank Sinatra on the
     stereo.  He's a little too loud, a little off key.

     The bodyguards eye Ich suspiciously.  He stumbles past
     them, then grabs the sliding door and yanks it open.

     INSIDE THE ROOM

     A low table.  Kobo is at one end.  An older,
     distinguished, sliver-haired man in his seventies whom we
     will come to know as SUGAI is at the other.  Ich can't
     believe his eyes:  Sugai is the head of the largest Yakuza
     syndicate in Japan.

     A half dozen LIEUTENANTS sit on either side of the table.
     Half are older, dressed in conservative suits; the other
     half are younger wearing $700 Issy Miyake jackets.

     SUGAI AND KOBO

     are having a heated discussion.  The GIRL Ich and Nick
     have been following walks over to Kobo and sits beside
     him.  This makes Sugai even more irate.  He's on his feet,
     red faced and screaming.

     FOUR GUARDS

     seeing Ich, pull out their Beretta's.  Two more grab him
     and fling him head first against the wall.

                         ICH
                    (drunken, in Japanese)
               I have to piss, gentlemen... I'm so
               sorry but I have to --

     The bodyguards hurry him towards the door.


     EXT.  HOSTESS CLUB

     Nick checks his watch, it's been an hour - where the hell
     is Ich?

     Ich comes stumbling up the steps, still affecting his
     drunken, pigeon-toed walk.  Nick, of course, thinks Ich
     has gotten drunk again.  Two of the bodyguards are
     watching from inside.

                         NICK
               I don't believe it...
                    (grabs him)
               Son-of-a-bitch --   

     Ich, knowing they're being watched, grabs Nick by the
     sleeve and drags him off still pretending to be drunk.

                         ICH
                    (under his breath)
               I'm not drunk...

                         NICK
               We're through.  I mean it.  This is
               the end of the line, Matsumoto.

                         ICH
               Nick --

                         NICK
               Shut-up.

     No longer fearing he's being watched, Ich abruptly stops
     his affected walk, and sounding very sober --

                         ICH
               You shut-up!
                    (then)
               Kobo is inside.  He's with Sugai,
               the head of the Summaguchi-clan.

     ACROSS THE STREET

     Ich is dialing on the police call box as he fills Nick in
     on Sugai.

                         ICH
               ... A Godfather.  His man was killed
               at the printing plant.

                         NICK
               I want to yank Kobo.

                         ICH
               Not without a small army, Nicklaus-
               san.

     Ich quickly speaks on the police phone, then hangs up,
     pleased with himself.

                         NICK
               Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus,
               not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san.
               Nick.

                         ICH
               San is an honorable title.

     Ich realizes it's better to drop it.

                                         CUT TO:

     THE HOSTESS CLUB - MINUTES LATER

     Drunken Salarymen spill out the door.

     ICH AND NICK

     are standing across the street waiting for the cops to
     arrive.

     Nick freezes.

     THE GIRL

     they've been following steps out and lights a cigarette.
     TIME SLOWS.  She looks up and spots the two men through
     the traffic.  Nick turns away, afraid he's been made.
     When he looks back, she's gone back inside.

                         NICK
               Shit...

     Nick races across the street toward the club.  Horns
     BLARE.

                         ICH
                    (doesn't understand)
               Nick?!

     IN FRONT OF THE CLUB

     Nick reaches the curb just as the front doors to the club
     BURST OPEN.  He's too late.  Three bodyguards burst out,
     checking the street.  A red and white Debonnaire pulls up.

     Sugai, surrounded by a half-dozen additional bodyguards,
     comes out and slips into the car.  It tears off down the
     street.

     SIRENS AND POLICE CARS

     from either end of the street peel around the corner.
     It's a madhouse.  The remaining lieutenants and bodyguards
     fan out, trying to elude arrest.

     Nick hurries down the steps.

     INSIDE THE CLUB

     The patrons are still in place, but the two side rooms are
     empty.

     Nick spots KOBO going out the rear entrance.  He starts
     after him but is confronted by the bouncer who stopped him
     earlier.  Nick connects to the guy's jaw before his
     adversary can raise his hands.  The bouncer staggers back.
     Nick flies out the rear door.

                                         CUT TO:

     EXT.  FRONT OF CLUB - NIGHT

     Several lieutenants and bodyguards toss their guns --
     possession is a felony in Japan -- as the police close in.


     INT.  HOSTESS CLUB - NIGHT

     Ich hurries in, but Nick's long gone.


     EXT.  REAR OF HOSTESS CLUB - NEARBY STREETS - NIGHT

     SILENCE.  The narrow streets are deserted.  Nick slowly
     makes his way down the street.  The SOUND of a GUNSHOT.
     Nick ducks for cover -- it's a car BACKFIRING.  He
     continues on.

     Nick's POV of a woman giving a man a blow-job in a narrow
     alley.  The man's face is hidden by the shadow.

     Nick continues on.

                         JAPANESE MAN (FROM THE DARKNESS)
               People like Charlie are a dime a
               dozen.

     Nick turns back to see Kobo as he steps into the light.

     Kobo tosses a handful of change at Nick.

                         KOBO
               Keep the change.

                         NICK
               I'm taking you back.

     The girl takes off down the block.

                         KOBO
               Here I am.

     From across the street, a dozen bodyguards appear from
     various doorways and alleys.

                         KOBO
               Charlie was a rookie...

     Kobo traces his finger across the spot where he cut Nick
     in New York.

                         KOBO
               ... But you can take care of
               yourself.  You're 'the biggest thing
               to hit this town since Godzilla.'

     Nick glances at the guards, then back at Kobo.  He is
     unarmed.  To make a move would be suicide.  More POLICE
     SIRENS in the b.g. closing in.

                         KOBO
               What's the matter.  I'm right in
               front of you, Nick.
                    (takes a step closer)
               But I was right in front of you when
               you let Charlie die.

     Kobo takes a step forward.  His face is inches from
     Nick's.

                         KOBO
               Walk away again.  Maybe you'll get
               used to it.

     Nick doesn't budge.

     A LONG BEAT, then... Nick turns and slowly walk off.
     After a dozen yards Nick looks back.

     The street is empty, except for a street sweeper pushing
     his wet broom down the block.


     EXT.  HOSTESS CLUB - NIGHT

     A half dozen bodyguards are being frisked, then shoved
     into police cars.

     Ohashi is talking to the enraged nightclub owner.  Nick
     steps up to him.  Ich hurries over.

                         ICH
               Nick!

                         NICK
                    (to Ohashi)
               A few minutes faster, we might've
               nailed him.

     Ohashi doesn't say a word, hands Nick a document.

                         NICK
               What's this?

                         OHASHI
               Your visa has expired.  Be on a
               plane in twenty-four hours or you
               will be deported.

                         NICK
               While you were hanging out at the
               visa office, we found the son-of-a-
               bitch.

                         OHASHI
               Look.

     Ohashi directs Nick's attention across the street where a
     SURVEILLANCE VAN is parked.  The rear doors are open
     revealing a van full of surveillance equipment and cops.

                         OHASHI
               You ruined an on-going investigation
               that could have gotten us more than
               one runner.
                    (to Ich, in Japanese)
               I want a full report in the morning,
               officer.

     Ich bows as Ohashi walks off.

                         NICK
               Maybe if you'd work with us --

     Ohashi ignores him, continues walking toward his waiting
     car.

                         NICK
                    (shouting)
               Hey...!
                    (Ohashi keeps
                     walking)
               HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!

                         OHASHI
                    (his back toward
                     Nick)
               Twenty-four hours, detective.

     Ohashi slips into his car.  Nick storms up to the car and
     slams his fist on the window.

                         NICK
               Ohashi!

     Ohashi faces straight ahead, ignoring Nick.  Nick takes
     the extradition paper and spikes it on the car antenna.

     Ich grabs Nick by his arm, pulling him back from the car.
     The car pulls away.

                         ICH
               Nick, stop!

     Nick whirls, and before he realizes what he's doing,
     punches Ich below his left eye.  Ich stumbles back over
     the curb and lands on his ass.

                         NICK
               Damnit, Ichiro, I'm tired of people
               telling me what I can and can't do.
               No one ever solved anything sitting
               on their ass.

     Nick, beside himself with frustration, watches Ohashi's
     car disappear down the block.

     ON ICH

     looking up at

     NICK

     who walks off without looking back at his partner.

                                         CUT TO:

     INT.  ICH'S BATHROOM - SEVERAL HOURS LATER

     Nick, standing beside the tub, dumps a pail of hot water
     over his head, rinsing himself off.  He grabs a towel and
     walks out of the room.


     INT.  ICH'S APARTMENT

     Ich, holding an ice pack to his face, is lying on a tatami
     mat against the wall looking up at the ceiling.  An open
     bottle of Seagrams beside him.

     Nick stretches out on another tatami on the opposite side
     of the room and looks up at the ceiling, too.

                         NICK
               The ice help?

     Nothing from Ich.

                         NICK
               Where does this Sugai live?

                         ICH
                    (cold)
               A resort city, Beppu.

                         NICK
               I want to go talk to him.

                         ICH
               What...?  Why?

                         NICK
               Because he knows how to get to our
               man.

                         ICH
               He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.

                         NICK
               I'll be a nice Gaiijin.

     Nick gets up and goes to the closet.  He slides open the
     door.  All of his and Charlie's clothes have been neatly
     hung up.

     He shoves Charlie's jacket aside.  Something's wrong with
     the way it hangs.  He pulls the jacket out, runs his hand
     over the coat, feeling something heavy in the lining.

     Nick rips the lining open.  Charlie's .32 Beretta and a
     spare clip tumble out.

                         NICK
               The little bastard.  God bless him.

     Ich takes a drink from his bottle.

                         ICH
               It's very small.

                         NICK
               Big enough.

                         ICH
               It's illegal, Nick.

                         NICK
               It's a new deal.
                    (putting it in his
                     waist band)
               ... coming with me tomorrow?

                         ICH
               Sugai's not going to be impressed
               with your gun, Nick.
                    (beat)
               No.  I won't put myself in danger
               for you anymore.

     Nick picks up the liquor cap which rolled across the
     floor.  He tosses it to Ich.  Ich reaches for it, but
     misses.

                         NICK
               Sure, pal.  You've got better things
               to do.

     Nick walks out shutting the door behind him.  Stay on Ich
     watching the door, then --

                                         CUT TO:

     EXT.  LAS VEGAS BAR - CLOSING TIME

     The last customers find their way to the street, some with
     a little encouragement from a BOUNCER.

     Joyce steps out.  Nick comes up to her.

                         NICK
               You know where I can get a decent
               cup of coffee this time of night?
               I'm buying.

                         JOYCE
               Somebody must be suffering
               somewhere, you're being so nice.

     Joyce takes off down the street.  Nick watches her for a
     beat.

                         NICK
               I need your help, Joyce.

                         JOYCE
               Where's Ich?

                         NICK
               Unavailable.

     INT.  KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

     On the stage, a young professional looking man is singing
     along to "SUMMERTIME" blasting from the stereo.  The
     Japanese way of letting it all hang out.

     We find Joyce and Nick at a corner table having a drink.

                         JOYCE
               I've heard of Sugai.  I've also
               heard of the emperor.  They're both
               national treasures.  One's a hood.

                         NICK
               I need someone to translate for me.

                         JOYCE
               My Japanese isn't that hot...
               Besides, you'll never get in.

                         NICK
               It's my last shot.  I have to be on
               a plane home tomorrow night.

                         JOYCE
               And I'm supposed to care?

                         NICK
               You could fake it.

     Joyce finishes her drink, sets it down.

                                         CUT TO:

     EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

     The neon flickers on the rain slicked pavement.  Nick and
     Joyce walk down the deserted street.  She's carrying an
     umbrella.

                         JOYCE
               You're wrong to sell Ich short.

                         NICK
               He drinks.

                         JOYCE
               He's got a reason.

     Nick shrugs, everyone's got a reason.

                         JOYCE
               His son hooked up with some bikers.
               Yakuza kids.  A cop shot him running
               from a robbery.

     Nick looks over for the first time.

                         JOYCE
               A father doesn't out live that kind
               of thing here, much less a police
               officer...

     Pause.

                         NICK
               Where's the wife?

                         JOYCE
               You met her.

     Nick looks surprised.

                         JOYCE
               The woman in the apartment.  She
               won't speak to him.  But she won't
               leave either.  Japan... Nice, huh?

     Before Nick can respond, something catches his eye:  What
     he sees --

     A MAN

     partially shadowed, standing in the alley.

     Nick grabs his gun.  The man steps out zipping up his
     trousers.  It's a drunken Salaryman.  Nick lowers his gun.
     The Salaryman staggers down the street singing to himself.

                         JOYCE
               Not wound too tight...

     EXT.  JOYCE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

     A three story modern building on a quiet street.  She's
     searching for her keys.

                         JOYCE
               I'd invite you up but I know you'd
               hate the incense.
                    (as if to explain)
               I chant.

                         NICK
               What do you chant?

                         JOYCE
               'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think
               it's dumb of course.

                         NICK
               Not if it works.
                    (holding the door
                     open for her)
               I'll meet you at the train?

                         JOYCE
               I don't remember saying yes.

                         NICK
               I don't remember you saying no.

     Joyce smiles, heads inside.

     INT.  ICH'S APARTMENT - DAWN

     Ich is sleeping.

     Nick slips into his leather motorcycle jacket.  He drops
     Charlie's gun into his pocket.  He glances down at Ich,
     seeing if he's awake.  He's not.  Nick walks out.

     Ich opens his eyes.  He's been awake the whole time.

                                         CUT TO:

     THE YANAKA CEMETERY - DAY

     Ich, wearing a blue suit, is pouring water over a simple
     stone with a wooden dipper.  Next, he places incense in a
     holder and folds his hands in prayer.

     The photo on the stone is of a young man wearing a school
     uniform.  Ich's son.

                                         DISSOLVE TO:

     A BULLET TRAIN - DAY

     It's bull's-eye nose cone scuds across the endless rice
     paddies west of Tokyo.  Women in straw hats stand in the
     knee deep water pruning the rice by hand.  Old Japan
     rubbing shoulders with the new.


     INT.  TRAIN - DAY

     CLOSE ON NICK looking out the window as the countryside
     shoots past at 140 mph.  From O.S. several children
     chanting:  "Harrow, Harrow."

     Nick looks over to see three uniformed school children
     thrusting their notebooks and pens at him.

     JOYCE

     is sitting across from Nick.

                         JOYCE
               They want your autograph.

                         NICK
               Who am I supposed to be?

                         JOYCE
               This little guy thinks you're Robert
               Redford... the other one thinks
               you're Charles Bronson...

                         NICK
               Tell them I'm not.

     She does, but the kids insist.

                         JOYCE
               They'll never go away.

     Nick, reluctantly signs.  Joyce takes one of the kid's
     notebooks before passing it back.

                         JOYCE
               Mick Jagger?

     Joyce smiles, surprised at his choice.  Then, she looks up
     shocked to see --

     ICH

     carrying a gift wrapped package under his arm.  He's
     wearing his hat, blue suit and tie.

     Ich sits ACROSS the aisle from Nick and Joyce.  He doesn't
     say a word.  Faces straight ahead.

     Nick looks at Joyce, then back at Ich.

                         NICK
               I'm sorry, Ichiro.  I lost it last
               night.  I shouldn't have hit you.

     Still nothing from Ich.

                         NICK
               What's in the box?

                         ICH
                    (still not facing
                     him)
               For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese,
               ham... If you come to apologize for
               interrupting his meeting, Sugai may
               feel obligated to see you.

                         NICK
               So I bring some cheese?

                         JOYCE
               Gifts are expected here.

     Nick nods, looks back out the window.  He'll never
     understand this country.  He looks back to see --

     Joyce looking annoyed at him.  Nick gets the message.

                         NICK
               Hey, Ich... Thanks.  I'm glad you're
               here.  I mean it.

     Ich still won't acknowledge Nick.


     EXT.  BULLET TRAIN

     The Bullet Train disappearing into the foothills.


     EXT.  BEPPU - DAWN

     Plumes of white steam spindle skyward from every street
     corner.  If you didn't know it was steam, you'd think the
     city was on fire.  Beppu is a resort famous for it's
     geothermal baths.


     EXT.  SUGAI'S HOUSE

     The only traditional house we'll see in our story.  It's
     surrounded by a pool of blood red steaming water from the
     hot springs.

     AT THE GATE

     CLOSE ON A 1000 yen bill as it is dropped on the ground.
     A pair of dice rolls over it.  A handful of GUARDS wearing
     suits and ties are playing craps.

     OUTSIDE THE GATE

     Ich is sitting on the ground leaning against the wall,
     sound asleep.  Nick is standing nearby.  He checks his
     watch.  Tired of waiting, he walks over to --

     JOYCE

     reading the Manichi Daily.

                         NICK
                    (impatiently)
               They took the gift an hour ago.

     The phone rings inside the gate.  A guard picks it up.

                         JOYCE
                    (certain it's bad
                     news)
               All's not lost.  There's a famous
               temple here.  We could chant.

     The guard hangs up, calls out to Joyce.  Joyce responds in
     Japanese.  The guard opens the gate.

                         NICK
               We're in?

                         JOYCE
               The cheese...


     INT.  A ROOM IN SUGAI'S HOUSE

     A vast, austere, traditional room with sliding rice paper
     doors and tatami mats on the floor.

     Ich and Joyce, drinking tea, are sitting with their feet
     beneath them in the traditional manor.

     Nick, smoking, is in a semi-sprawl; using his tea cup as
     an ashtray.

     A LIEUTENANT enters.  He says something and beckons.  They
     all rise.  He says something else.

                         JOYCE
                    (to Nick)
               Just you.


     INT.  ANOTHER ROOM - SUGAI'S HOUSE

     Nick enters, ducking his head in the low doorway.  the
     shoji slides shut behind him.

     The furnishings are minimal but elegant.  There's a
     butsudan, a tokonoma, and a low, long table in the middle
     of the room.  No chairs.  Nick sits on the floor.

     A door slides open at the far end of the room.  Sugai,
     wearing a kimono over western style suit, walks in.  Nick
     stands up to shake his hand.  Sugai ignores it, and sits
     in the traditional position:  feet tucked beneath him.

                         SUGAI
               I'll spare you the ritual.

     He tosses him a palm sized bundle.  Nick catches it.
     Inside, are brand new greenbacks:  hundreds.

                         NICK
               This supposed to impress me?

     He sets it down.

                         SUGAI
               Pick it up.  Look at it.

     Nick hesitates, then picks it up again.  He runs his
     fingers over the face of the bill and snaps the paper.

                         SUGAI
               Seven years work by the finest
               engraver.  Mass produced,
               sequentially numbered.  The best
               there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.

                         NICK
               I'm impressed.  But let's use the
               short form.  I'm looking for --

                         SUGAI
               -- Kobo... I know.  He killed two of
               my partners.  One in New York, one
               at the printing plant.

     Sugai fills a cup of tea for Nick and hands it to him.

                         NICK
               I don't drink tea.

     Sugai hands it to him anyway.

                         SUGAI
               I took Kobo from the street.  I gave
               him a home, a future... But my ways
               were too slow for him... I served
               seven years in prison for my boss
               when I was a young man.  Kobo
               wouldn't serve seven minutes for his
               Oyabun.
                    (sipping his tea)
               He was supposed to take over this
               syndicate when I retired.

                         NICK
               I want him.

                         SUGAI
               He'll be dealt with.

     Sugai sets a plastic wrapped object on a table before
     Nick.  Nick recognizes it from the restaurant massacre in
     New York.

     CLOSE UP:  Nick's fingers tear at the plastic.  A block of
     black iridescent polymer.  The negative image of a $100.00
     bill.  A printing plate.

                         SUGAI
               Our associates in New York were
               close to closing a deal with us.

                         NICK
               The families who control the
               casinos?

                         SUGAI
               Yes.  Unlike our syndicates, your
               criminals don't understand the words
               'honor' and 'duty'... We can't
               afford not to deal with them.

     Sugai takes the plate back.

                         SUGAI
               Imagine if your families could pay
               their gambling and drug debts with
               perfect counterfeit bought for cents
               on the dollar.

                         NICK
               The Feds would be onto you in a
               month.

                         SUGAI
               Not with these bills.  And even if
               it only took them six months, do you
               know what our profit margin would
               be?

     Nick looks at a child playing near one of the hot pools in
     Sugai's garden.

                         NICK
               Why tell me this?

                         SUGAI
               The other plate is currently in New
               York, in the hands of Kobo's man.
               Find it for me.

                         NICK
               You trust me?

                         SUGAI
               I'll pay you.

     Nick laughs at Sugai's audaciousness.

                         NICK
                    (indicating the
                     counterfeit bills)
               With these?

                         SUGAI
               Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion.
               Whatever you want.  You know the
               city and the police.

                         NICK
               If I say no?

                         SUGAI
               You're smarter than Kobo.  You know
               the price of deceit.  Think about
               it.

                         NICK
               I don't have to.

     Sugai cools.  Without a word he gets to his feet and
     starts toward the door.

                         NICK
               I have ten hours to grab my man.

     ON SUGAI

     still walking with his back to Nick.

                         NICK (O.S.)
               You won't get hurt.

     Sugai turns to see Nick, across the room, pointing the
     Beretta at his head.

                                         CUT TO:

     INT.  ROOM - SUGAI'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

     The room where Ich and Joyce are waiting.  Sugai enters.
     Their surprise turns to shock when they see Nick behind
     him holding a gun to the old man's head.

                         ICH
               No...

                         NICK
               Let's go.  Him first.

                         ICH
               Nick, you can't do this.

                         NICK
               It's done.
                    (to Joyce)
               You don't have to come.

     She hasn't moved a muscle.


     INT SUGAI'S HOUSE - ENTRANCE WAY

     Sugai watches calmly as Nick, Ich, and Joyce put their
     shoes on.  Nick keeps the gun on him.

                                         CUT TO:

     EXT.  SUGAI'S COURTYARD

     Nick steps out of the house.  He now has one end of a wire
     coat hanger loosely wrapped around Sugai's neck, the other
     end around his wrist.  His gun is pressed just beneath
     Sugai's ear.  If nick gets shot, so does Sugai.

     A handful of guards stand in the courtyard, one is
     polishing Sugai's Debonnaire car.  They spot Nick and
     Sugai coming, and immediately pull their guns.

                         NICK
               Explain to them.  They shoot me,
               they kill you.
                    (Sugai hesitates)
               DO IT!

     Sugai explains to his lieutenants.  They stand helpless as
     Nick walks Sugai toward the car.

                         NICK
               Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.

                         ICH
               No.

                         NICK
               Not now, man, okay, not now.  Work
               with me.

     Ich takes the keys from the man polishing the car.  He
     gets inside.  Joyce hurries in bedside him.

                         ICH
               You don't know what you're doing.

     Nick slides Sugai in the back seat, carefully reaches over
     and shuts the door.

                         NICK
               Start it.

                         ICH
                    (terrified)
               I can't...

                         JOYCE
               Slide over.

     Joyce, furious at Nick, starts the car, gets behind the
     wheel.  Ich gets in on the other side.

     She spins the car around.  The gate opens.  They tear off.

                                         CUT TO:

     EXT.  STREET - BEPPU - DAY

     The car bursts through the funnels of steam from the hot-
     springs beneath the street.  It tears down the narrow
     block dodging traffic.  Joyce is concentrating hard on the
     road.

                         NICK
                    (to Ich)
               Where's somewhere safe?

     Nothing from Ich.  He's still apoplectic.

                         JOYCE
                    (angrily)
               You came up with the first part.

                                         CUT TO:

     EXT.  KUDAN LOVE HOTEL - BEPPU

     A four story concrete hotel, strictly for making love.
     "Love Hotels" exist all over Japan.  Each have various
     themes:  western, fifties drive in, Star Wars, etc., each
     complete with music and lighting effects.


     INT.  HOTEL ROOM

     Western style.  Plastic five foot cacti in front of the
     western vista on the walls.  A hitching post at the head
     of the bed.  Cowboy hats and boots at the other end.

     Sugai hangs up the phone and turns to Nick and Joyce who
     are sitting nearby.  Ich hangs up the extension.

                         SUGAI
               Kobo will meet me here tomorrow.
               Ten a.m.

     Ich nods, confirming that what Sugai says is true.

                         NICK
               Good.

                         SUGAI
               He'll find out you took me.  I'm
               unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of
               us.  You don't stand a chance.

     Ich, knowing Sugai is right, looks at Nick.  Nick flips
     Ich the gun.

                         NICK
               Not if we're careful.

     Ich checks to make sure the gun is loaded, then watches as
     Nick escorts Joyce out of the room.

                                         CUT TO:

     A HOTEL ROOM ACROSS THE HALL

     Fifties theme.  The front end of a pink chevy curves
     around the bed.  A "Drive-In" movie screen along one wall.

     Nick is dropping change into the vintage Wurlitzer.  Joyce
     steps in, leaving the door open.

                         JOYCE
               You're out of your mind.  I'm
               leaving.

     Nick doesn't respond.

                         JOYCE
               You'll get Ich killed.

                         NICK
               No one's keeping him here.

                         JOYCE
               Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me
               this is all just about Charlie.
               It's not.

                         NICK
               Why would you care?

     That pushes her over the line.

                         JOYCE
               Bastard...

     She moves toward him, enraged.  Nick grabs her arm.

                         JOYCE
               Let go.

     He won't.

                         JOYCE
               You're out of your mind.

     He grips her tighter.

                                         CUT TO:

     THE ROOM - LATER

     Nick and Joyce, only partially undressed, are making love
     on the floor.  The Drifters singing "Under The Boardwalk"
     can be heard on the Wurlitzer.  The fifties decor, the
     music, it's all pretty incongruous.

                                         CUT TO:

     EXT.  LOVE HOTEL - DAWN

     Nick is putting Joyce in a taxi.  He shuts the door.

                         JOYCE
               I still think you're a bastard.

                         NICK
               What if I chant?

                         JOYCE
               Wouldn't help.
                    (beat)
               Watch out for Ich.

     He nods.  The cab drives off.  Nick watches her taxi until
     it is out of sight, around a corner, then heads inside.

                                         CUT TO:

     NICK - LATER

     walking into Sugai's room.  Sugai's asleep on the bed.
     Ich is vigilantly sitting awake in the corner, the gun
     resting on the table in front of him.

                         NICK
               Better wake him up.

                                         CUT TO:

     EXT.  LOVE HOTEL - LATER

     Quiet.  The wind twirls a discarded newspaper in the
     parking lot.

     INSIDE THE LOVE HOTEL - HALLWAY

     A YOUNG GIGGLING COUPLE step out of a door, arm in arm,
     and disappear down the hall.  STAR WARS MUSIC from one
     room.  HAWAIIAN MUSIC from another.

     THE CAMERA FINDS the closed elevator door.  It opens, Kobo
     steps out, followed by a half-dozen more men all carrying
     Sig-Saur assault rifles -- very heavy artillery.

                                         CUT TO:

     SUGAI

     wearing his hat and coat is sitting on the couch, his back
     to us, facing out the window.

     Drop down to --

     THE ROOM BENEATH HIM

     A couple are making love in the Hawaiian theme room.

     The door burst open.  Two men, cradling Sig-Saur rifles in
     their arms, step in.  They aim at the ceiling, blasting
     into Sugai's room above.

     THE GIRL

     starts screaming.  The men ignore her and continue to pump
     bullets into the ceiling.

     KOBO AND HIS MEN

     stop in front of every door long enough to blast into the
     room.  They make their way down the hall.

     A naked man steps into the hallway and is matter-of-factly
     gunned down.

     Kobo and his men stop in front of Sugai's room.


     INT.  SUGAI'S ROOM

     Sugai, wearing his hat, is slumped down on the couch which
     has been splintered by the bullets from below.

     OUTSIDE THE ROOM

     Kobo signals the men.  All six open-up through the door.

     INSIDE THE ROOM

     The door, what's left of it, is kicked open.  The six men
     step in, shooting in all directions:  into the bathroom
     door, into the closet... Windows shatter, mirrors fall,
     total destruction.  They stop.  SILENCE.

     Kobo walks up to Sugai who is slumped on the couch.  He
     lifts up his hat.  It's a cowboy mannequin wearing Sugai's
     clothes.

     THE ELEVATOR DOOR

     opens.  A DOZEN of Sugai's men carrying machine pistols
     come out.

     THE OUTSIDE BALCONY

     Nick and Ich lie on their bellies, guns out.

     INSIDE THE ROOM

     Kobo's men turn.  Sugai's men open-up.  Three of Kobo's
     hitters go down.  The others try to flee into the
     adjoining room.

     Kobo goes for the balcony.

     THE BALCONY

     as Kobo steps out.  He steps right into --

     NICK

     who slams the side of Kobo's head with the butt of his
     gun.

     THE ROOM   

     Nick and Ich drag Kobo in by his jacket collar.  Sugai,
     very much alive, walks in from the hallway.  Nothing is
     said.  Sugai looks at Kobo for a long beat, then walks
     out.

                                         CUT TO:

     INT.  SUGAI'S HOUSE - DAY

     KOBO

     standing alone in the middle of a tatami room.  His face
     is badly beaten.  His hands are bound.  Two guards stand
     near the wall.  Nick and Ich stand across the room.

     SUGAI

     wearing a western suit, is asking Kobo questions in
     Japanese.  Sugai barks at him again.  Kobo refuses to
     answer.  Sugai pulls up a shuto -- an 18 inch knife --
     from it's scabbard.

                         SUGAI
                    (in Japanese)
               Contact your associate in New York
               and tell him to hand my plate over
               to Abolofia.

     Nothing from Kobo.

                         SUGAI
               You have betrayed the syndicate and
               personally dishonored me.  I would
               rather the deal fell through than...

     The guards walk over and turn Kobo around.  His back is to
     Sugai.  Sugai runs the sword across the nape of Kobo's
     neck drawing blood.  The guards tighten their grip on
     Kobo's arms.

     NICK

     can't believe Sugai's going to kill him.  Nick starts to
     get up, Ich stops him.

     Kobo realizes Sugai isn't just threatening him.

                         KOBO
               No... I'll arrange it.

                                         DISSOLVE TO:

     THE ROOM - LATER

     Kobo is led back into the room by two guards.  The guards
     shove him down to the floor.  His hands are still bound.

     Nick walks over and stands above him.  He doesn't say a
     word.  Just stands above him.  Then, Nick pulls spare
     change from his pocket and slowly drops the coins, one by
     one, in front of Kobo's face, like Kobo did to him.  He
     walks away.

     Sugai steps in.

                         SUGAI
               Abolofia's person has received the
               plate.  It's done.

     A door opens at the far end of the room.  It's Kobo's
     girlfriend, the one Nick and Ich had been following.

     She starts toward Kobo; a lieutenant intercepts her.

                         SUGAI
                    (in Japanese)
               I wanted you to see him like this.

                         GIRL
                    (in Japanese)
               Let him go, father.

     ON ICH

     realizing she's Sugai's daughter.

                         GIRL
                    (in Japanese)
               You're too old...

                         SUGAI
                    (in Japanese)
               That's enough.

     Sugai turns away and picks up the sword.  The guards
     clutch Kobo.  Sugai's going to kill Kobo after all.

     The girl screams at him to stop.  Sugai's oblivious.

                         NICK (O.S.)
               That wasn't our deal.

                         SUGAI
               You want him dead too.

                         NICK
               After a court convicts him.  He
               belongs to me.

     There's a long pause.  Then, something unusual happens.
     Sugai tells the lieutenant to unfasten Kobo's wrist.  When
     he does, Sugai hands Kobo the sword and demands that he
     cut off his finger.

     This is Yubitsume:  the ritual act within the Yakuza of
     slicing the joint of the little finger to atone for a
     mistake.

     Kobo, not believing in this ancient tradition, refuses.
     Sugai nods to a guard who places Kobo's finger on the
     table.

     KOBO

     stares defiantly at Sugai.  He doesn't even wince as the
     blade slices off his finger.  The guard hands Sugai the
     finger in a handkerchief.

                         SUGAI
                    (looking at Nick)
               If anything happens to Abolofia or
               my plate, detective...

     HOLD on Nick then --

                                         CUT TO:

     EXT.  TRAIN - DAY

     as it bursts out of a tunnel on it's way to Tokyo.


     INT.  TRAIN - DAY

     Kobo is sitting by the window, his hands cuffed in front
     of him.  Another pair of cuffs chain him to the arm rest.

     Nick pours a drink from an airline-sized bottle of Scotch.
     He holds it out to... Ich.  It's his first drink in a
     week.

                         NICK
               Just one, compadre... Kampai.

                         ICH
               Kampai.

     They clink glasses.  Ich drinks it down.

                         NICK
               It took 12 years to make it, you
               could take five minutes to drink it.

     Ich slows down.

                         NICK
               You did great, Ichiro.

                         ICH
               I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.
                    (smiling)
               I like him waiting.

     Ich gets up.

                         ICH
               Needs ice.

     He heads for the bar car, leaving Kobo and Nick alone.

     Kobo looks out the window at the people working the rice
     paddies, then back down the aisle at the Salarymen in
     their identical suits, then at the women separated from
     them.

                         KOBO
               Ugly... A couple of thousand years
               they've been bound by these little
               rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid.
               Ugly little lives...

                         NICK
               Save it, I already took the tour.

                         KOBO
               You are a lucky man.  Where you come
               from a man can stand out.  It's
               expected.  Here a man is made to
               look a fool for standing out.

     Nick isn't paying much attention.

                         KOBO
               I like your friend, Joyce.  You're
               lucky.

                         NICK
               Guess I'm on a roll.

                         KOBO
               She's such a long way home for you.

                         NICK
               Time, I've got plenty of.

     A raucous SALARYMAN comes down the aisle, singing an Enka,
     swaying with the train, bumping into seats.  A common
     enough sight and ignored by the rest of the passengers.
     The Salaryman stumbles and falls across Nick's lap.

                         NICK
                    (helping him up)
               Hey, hey, come on, blow...

     The Salaryman bows deep.  Nick ignores it.  The man moves
     on.  Kobo looks out the window, the train begins to SLOW
     as it approaches the next station.

                         KOBO
                    (matter-of-factly)
               This is my stop.

                         NICK
               I'm amused.

                         KOBO
               Don't be.

     Nick looks up to see Kobo calmly fingering a lock of blond
     hair tied with black ribbon.  Joyce's ribbon.  Joyce's
     hair.

                         KOBO
               I have her.

     Nick looks down the car.  The drunk Salaryman who stumbled
     over Nick is quite sober.  He made the hand-off to Kobo.
     Kobo holds out his wrists.  Nick hesitates.

                         KOBO
                    (matter-of-factly)
               I'll kill her.

     Nick, reluctantly, unlocks both sets of cuffs.  The train
     pulls into the station.

                         KOBO
               I want the plate from your pal,
               Sugai.  When you get it, you get
               her.

     Kobo gets up, starts down the aisle.

                         NICK
               Sugai won't give it to me, you know
               that.

                         KOBO
               Then take it from him.

     Kobo gets off the train.

     NICK

     follows him to the door.

     THE STATION

     Kobo get into a waiting Jaguar.  Four guards nearby.

     INSIDE THE TRAIN

     Nick runs down the length of the car trying to keep the
     Jaguar in sight as the train pulls out... the car is gone.

     NICK

     bursts into the packed bar car.

                         NICK
               Ichiro?!

     Everyone turns around.  No Ich.

                                         CUT TO:

     EXT.  TRAIN - TRAIN STATION - TOKYO

     It slows into the station.


     INT.  TRAIN

     Nick shoves past the passengers lined up in the vestibule,
     ignoring a conductor's angry shouts.


     INT.  TERMINAL - MOMENTS LATER

     The train stops.  Nick flies out and starts running,
     dodging the crowd.

     Three uniformed policemen, including Ohashi's assistant,
     hurry toward him; they're dismayed to find that Kobo is
     gone.

                         NICK
               Where's Ohashi?

     Instead of offering him help, the policemen grab him and
     slap a pair of handcuffs on Nick's wrists.

                         NICK
               What the hell are you doing?!

                                         CUT TO:

     HOLDING CELL - TOKYO POLICE STATION

     Nick, waiting alone in the cell.  It's been hours.  A door
     at the end of the hall opens.

     Ohashi stops in front of his cell.

                         OHASHI
               Your plane leaves at six.  Two
               officers will escort you.

                         NICK
               For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your
               help.  Let me out of here!

                         OHASHI
               You had my help, detective.

                         NICK
               If anything happens to her while I'm
               here --

                         OHASHI
               -- Do you know where she is,
               detective?  Do you know how to find
               her?  Even where to start?  We will
               find them.

                         NICK
               I have to get to Sugai.

                         OHASHI
               Goodbye, officer.

     Ohashi keeps walking.

                         NICK
               OHASHI!

     The LOUD clank of metal on metal.  Ohashi's gone.

                         NICK
                    (yelling at the top
                     of his lungs)
               OHASHI!!

     HOLD on Nick, his fingers squeezing the bars in rage,
     then --

                                         CUT TO:

     EXT.  ROAD - DAY

     Flood rice paddies stretch to the distance on either side
     of the road.  We PAN over to Kobo at a phone kiosk outside
     a gas station.

                         KOBO
                    (in Japanese)
               Yes.  Do it.


     INT.  SUGAI'S HOUSE - AT THAT MOMENT

     Kobo's girl, Sugai's daughter, hangs up the phone.  She's
     been on the other end of the line.


     INT.  SUGAI'S ROOM

     The door swings open.  Sugai is sitting on the floor.  The
     girl is carrying a tray of tea.  Beneath the tray, we spot
     something else -- the butt of a short-bladed tanto.

                                         CUT TO:

     EXT.  NARITA AIRPORT - TOKYO - DAY

     A police car rolls through the service gate.  We see Nick
     inside the car along with two police guards.


     INT.  HOLDING ROOM - NARITA AIRPORT

     A white room.  No chairs.  Jet engines can be HEARD
     through the walls.  Nick is sitting on the floor,
     defeated.  He doesn't look up when he hears someone enter.

                         ICH (O.S.)
               I'll tell you one thing.  You can't
               solve a thing sitting on your ass.

     Nick looks up.  Ich is in uniform.  A revolver and batton
     hang from his white web gear.  His undershirt bulges
     through his khaki shirt.  He looks ridiculous.  Nick has
     never seen a more beautiful sight.

                                         CUT TO:

     INT.  POLICE CAR

     Ich is driving.  Nick is seated behind a cage in the back
     seat.  His hands are cuffed.  Ich is driving through the
     freight area towards a perimeter guard.

                         NICK
               I was ready to have your ass for
               taking off on me.

                         ICH
               I followed them.  An hour from the
               train station.

                         NICK
               How many men?

                         ICH
               I couldn't tell.

                         NICK
               Joyce?

                         ICH
               I don't know.

                         NICK
               We need the plate to negotiate with.

     Ich nods.


     EXT.  AT THE GATE - TOKYO AIRPORT

     The car slows.  Ich speaks rapidly to the guard showing
     him his papers.  The guard takes a good hard look at Nick.
     Time stands still... He waves them through.  Nick can
     breath again.

                         NICK
               You know, Ichiro, you just burned
               your bridges.

     Ich is silent for a moment.  He hands Nick's Beretta back
     through the partition.  So it goes.

                         ICH
               Rest.

     Nick looks for Ich's eyes in the rearview mirror.  The
     little cop keeps driving, his eyes on the road.

                                         DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT.  STREET - BEPUKU - DAY

     Nick and Ich are standing outside their car.  The Police
     radio crackles from inside.

     WHAT THEY SEE:

     A large crowd gathered outside of Sugai's estate.  Police
     have cordoned off the area.  An empty ambulance is parked
     out front with various other cars:  Debonnaire's,
     Cadillac's... A boy in shorts is endlessly bouncing a ball
     against the compound wall.  Whatever happened is long
     over.

     Ich flips off the radio.

                         ICH
               Someone attacked him.

                         NICK
               Now we've got nothing to negotiate
               with.

                                         CUT TO:

     EXT.  ROAD - DUSK

     The police car streaks across endless fields.

     INSIDE THE CAR

     Nick is at the wheel.  He rubs the sleep from his eyes.
     Ich is slumped down in the seat watching the road.

     Ich pulls out a cigarette.  Nick lights it for him.

                         NICK
               Joyce told me about your family.
               It's tough...

     Ich looks up surprised.

                         ICH
               Thank you.
                    (beat)
               You have one?

                         NICK
               A wife.  She left.

                         ICH
               I'm sorry.

                         NICK
               Me too.

     Ich glances over at Nick, then back at the road.

     Nicks rubs out his cigarette and presses down on the
     accelerator.

                                         DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT.  KOBO'S HIDEOUT - DAWN

     A small, contemporary house perched on a dry piece of
     land.  A paved road, lined with dense foliage runs on a
     berm between the flooded rice paddies.

     ON NICK AND ICH

     sitting in the car watching from a hillside turnoff.
     There's no easy way in.

                         NICK
               Let's go.

     Ich hands Charlie his shuto -- an 18 inch long knife.

                         NICK
               What's that for?

                         ICH
               Luck.

     Nick tucks the shuto inside his jacket.

                         NICK
               Thanks.

     Nick opens up his door and climbs out.

                         ICH
               You know, Nick, we can't lose.

                         NICK
                    (stopping)
               Why's that?

                         ICH
               Because we're the biggest things to
               hit this town since Godzilla.

                                         CUT TO:

     THE DIRT ROAD

     leading to the house lined with foliage.  The rice paddies
     on either side.

                                         CUT TO:

     NICK AND ICH

     making their way through the waist high water.

     TWO WORKERS

     with their hoes make their way into the water.  They don't
     see our cops.

     OUR COPS

     making their way along the edge of the road.  The SOUND of
     a motorcycle coming.

     THE MOTORCYCLE RIDER

     slows and drops a gear as he turns off the main road and
     onto the dirt berm toward the house.  He's one of Kobo's
     Bosozoku -- a long way from the streets of Tokyo.

     The rider comes around the bend to see --

     A COP

     standing in a uniform.  Ich.  For a moment he doesn't know
     what to do.  Then, he draws a pistol from his belt and
     accelerates toward Ich.

     ICH

     stands his ground as the bike closes in.  The biker takes
     aim.

     Ich drops off to the side as --

     NICK

     rises from a ditch and swings a hoe at the rider as he
     passes, catching the man across the face.  The rider drops
     like a swatted fly.  The biker's momentum carries it a few
     yards before it falls and skids to a halt.

     Nick hurries to the bike.

     Ich drags the biker off the road, then catches up to his
     partner.

     NICK AND ICH

     raise the heavy bike.  Nick mounts.  He takes the riders
     helmet and goggles from Ich, and puts them on.

                         ICH
               What are you going to do?

     Nick doesn't know exactly.  He taps the bike into gear, it
     torques like a mule.  There's a lot more juice here
     than he's used to.

     Nick fishtails for a minute, then gets the hang of it.

     Ich heads off taking another route.


     INT.  HOUSE

     KOBO AND SUGAI'S DAUGHTER

     are putting the last of their belongings into a suitcase.
     She hands him the plate -- Sugai's plate.

     Kobo kisses her as he slips it into his breast pocket.
     The SOUND of a motorcycle approaching from outside.


     EXT.  THE HOUSE

     Kobo steps out, and not recognizing Nick, raises his hand
     to greet what he thinks is one of his men.

     ON NICK

     bearing down on Kobo.

     ON KOBO

     as Nick keeps coming.  He is unable to see clearly until
     Nick is almost on top of him.

     NICK

     dumps the bike at the foot of the stairs and leaps on
     Kobo.

     Nick and Kobo roll off the narrow porch.  Nick breaks
     free.  He isn't fighting fair this time.  He slams his
     foot into Kobo's face and ribs.  Kobo tries to get up, but
     Nick knees him in the chin.

     A woman cries out in Japanese.  Nick turns to see

     JOYCE

     standing at the top of the steps.  A biker is pressing the
     muzzle of a Sig-Saur assault rifle on her.  Kobo's girl is
     beside them holding a small pistol.

     KOBO

     gets to his feet.  The biker tosses Kobo the rifle.  Kobo
     works the charging lever and holds the weapon at his side.
     He has all the time in the world.

     Kobo whirls and kicks Nick in the groin.  Nick falls to
     his knees in agony.

     Kobo towers above Nick as he did in the alley in New York.

                         KOBO
               Still on your knees, Nick?

     Kobo walks off, his back to Nick.

                         KOBO
               There's nothing you can do for me
               anymore.  I have the plate.  Sugai's
               dead.  No there is something.

     He walks up to the steps to Joyce.

                         KOBO
               You can tell me who I should shoot
               first.

     Nick struggles to get to his feet.  Kobo turns and faces
     Nick at the foot of the steps.

     ICH

     appears behind Kobo and takes him down with an amazing
     display of baton work that shows a lifetime of training.

     He grabs the gun.  A biker bursts out of the door.  Ich
     fires, hitting him in the thigh.  He drops his gun.

     SUGAI'S DAUGHTER

     grabs the gun.

     NICK

     tackles her, and wrestles the gun away.  She grabs for it.
     Nick slugs her.

     A GUN BLAST

     Ich is hit in the back of his shoulder, falls onto the
     porch.

     KOBO

     the shooter, is holding a pistol -- a Glock 17 automatic.
     He fires at

     NICK AND JOYCE

     who scramble for cover.

     KOBO

     continues firing as he climbs onto a motorcycle.  He pops
     the clutch and flies off down the road.  Nick fires after
     him, but Kobo's gone.

                         NICK
                    (to Ich)
               You all right?

                         ICH
               Yes...

                         NICK
                    (to Joyce)
               Call for help.

     Nick mounts the other bike, and puts the turbo charged
     rocket into gear.

     THE ROAD

     Rain pours down as Kobo turns onto the main road.  He
     opens up the throttle, and in less than a second, he's a
     screaming dot in the distance.

     NICK

     comes around the same corner.  His bike fishtails and
     slides out from under him.

     FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD

     Kobo tears past a police car.  The police car takes off
     after him.

     THE FOOTHILLS

     A series of steep switchbacks traverse the steep, densely
     forested hills.

     Kobo's bike flies up the road.  The police car can't keep
     up, begins losing ground.

     THE POLICE CAR

     going flat out, falling further and further behind.
     Kobo's going to escape.

     SUDDENLY

     Nick, bent low, shoots past the cop car.  His left arm is
     scraped and bloody.

     ON KOBO

     glancing back, to see Nick gaining on him.  Kobo's
     pleased.  He gives it more gas.

     NICK

     pulling eight-five... ninety... one hundred.  The rain
     stings his face.  It's hard to keep his eye open.

     THE FOOTHILLS

     Kobo leaning into one of the steep turns, climbing higher
     and higher toward the clouds clinging to the top of the
     peak.

     NICK

     is gaining on him.  He HEARS something coming up behind
     him.

     A BOSOZOKU

     the one Ich shot in the leg, is closing fast on his tail.

     ON NICK

     as the biker draws even.

     THE BIKER

     pulls out his long knife and slashes at Nick's shoulder.

     Nick drops back causing him to miss.  The biker drops
     back.  Nick tries to speed up, but the biker sticks with
     him.  He's a good rider, this boy.  Very, very good.

     The biker moves in again, blade drawn.

     NICK SEES

     something the biker doesn't.

     A TRUCK

     coming around the corner.

     NICK

     swerves to avoid it at the last moment.  The biker reacts
     too late and runs --

     INTO THE GLEAMING

     radiator of the two ton truck, and disappears beneath its
     wheels.

     ON KOBO

     around the bend, glancing back.  Empty road.  He eases up
     on the throttle -- a free man... He circles back only to
     see

     NICK

     burst around the corner charging toward him at a hundred-
     and-twenty miles per hour, in the driving rain.

     KOBO

     waits and waits.  Nick draws closer.  Then, Kobo tears off
     back down the mountain, shooting past Nick.

     Nick brakes... He slows down, and starts to turn, but the
     wheels whirl on the gravel and the bike goes into a skid,
     heading right for the edge of the road.

                                         CUT TO:

     NICK'S MOTORCYCLE

     flying over the edge of the road, and down the cliff.

                                         CUT TO:

     THE EDGE OF THE ROAD

     Nick, lying on his stomach at the edge of the cliff, his
     arm is probably broken.

     He tries to get up with a one arm push up.  It's hopeless.
     His head falls into a puddle of water.

     The WHINE of an approaching motorcycle.  Kobo has come
     back for him.

     Nick, in excruciating pain, struggles for his gun.

     KOBO

     bearing down on Nick.

     NICK

     struggling to get his gun.  Finally he does.  But it's
     caked in mud.  If the barrel is stuffed it will explode.
     Nick has to take the chance.

     ON KOBO

     Closer and closer.

     NICK

     aims as best he can and fires.  The mud caked gun explodes
     in his hand.  Nick screams in agony.

     KOBO

     pulls his bike up inches in front of Nick's head.  Nick
     seems to be bleeding everywhere:  his hand, his nose, his
     mouth, the side of his head...

     Kobo's face and neck is caked in blood from when Nick beat
     him.

     The rain pours down.

     He picks up the gun.  Points it at Nick, squeezes the
     trigger.

                         KOBO
                    (slowly)
               Bang... bang...

     He tosses the gun in front of Nick's face.

                         KOBO
               ... You're dead.

     The sound of approaching Police SIRENS.

     Kobo swings the bike around, goes a hundred yards down the
     road, then swings back.

     Kobo guns the engine.  He gain speed... thirty, thirty-
     five.

     NICK

     struggles to get up.  He can't.

     KOBO

     opening the throttle.

     NICK

     crawling a few inches, that's it.

     KOBO

     twenty yards away.

     NICK

     reaches into his coat and pulls Ich's 18 inch shuto out.

     He rolls away at the last moment, slashing Kobo's ankle as
     he races past.

     KOBO

     screams in pain.  He tries to stop too suddenly.  The bike
     flips over.  Kobo flies into the air then hits the
     pavement on his side and rolls a few yards down the road.
     He stops on his back.  It's lucky he's alive.

     The SOUND of fast approaching police SIRENS.

     THE PLATE

     has fallen out of Kobo's jacket.  It rests in the road,
     halfway between the two men.

     KOBO

     crawls toward it on his belly.

     NICK

     mustering all his strength, struggles across the road on
     all fours.

     KOBO

     crawling snake-like.

     NICK

     still moving, his arms and legs feel like lead.

     KOBO'S FINGERS

     as they reach for the plate.

     NICK

     grabs Kobo's wrist forcing him to drop the plate.  Nick
     picks up a rock.  It looks as if he's going to smash
     Kobo's head.  Instead, he brings it down on the plate,
     shattering it in a half-dozen pieces.

     Nick tosses the pieces in front of Kobo's face.

                         NICK
               Keep the change.

     Nick, exhausted, slowly falls onto his back.  He looks
     over at Kobo, their faces are inches apart.  Nick makes a
     slashing mark with his index finger above his eyebrows.
     The same gesture Kobo made to Nick through the two-way
     mirror in New York.

     Nick passes out.  His eyes shut... the screen...

                                        FADES TO BLACK.

     BLACK SCREEN

     The SOUND of three police cars screeching to a halt.  The
     SOUNDS of the police SIRENS winding down.

     The SIRENS get softer mixing with the SOUND of RINGING
     phones, CLACKING typewriters, VOICES...


     FADE IN:

     INT.  TOKYO POLICE HEADQUARTERS

     Fifty identical desks.  Fifty identically dressed men in
     white shirts and ties work under fluorescent lights.

     OHASHI

     is at his desk studying a report.

     Suddenly, the lights go out.  The fan's stop, so do the
     electric typewriters.

     Ohashi looks up to see --

     ICH

     walking toward him down the long aisle, his left arm is
     bandaged, his right hand handcuffed to Kobo on crutches.

     Ich silently leads the captured man down the long aisle to
     Ohashi's desk.

     ICH

     stops in front of the desk and snaps to attention.

                         ICH
               Constable Ichiro Matsumoto presents
               captured prisoner Kobo, Chief
               Inspector Ohashi.

     Ich salutes.

                         OHASHI
               Inspector Ohashi will take charge of
               the prisoner.

     Ich uncuffs Kobo and steps aside to reveal --

     NICK

     standing at the far end of the room by the fuse box.  He's
     also bandaged and on crutches.

     Nick looks at Ohashi without saying a word, then flips the
     main switch up.  The lights and fans start working.

     He turns and walks out the door.

                                         CUT TO:

     EXT.  POLICE COURTYARD - A FEW DAYS LATER

     A small decoration ceremony.

     ON ICHIRO

     getting two golden suns pinned to the lapel of his dress
     uniform.

     In the far corner

     NICK, JOYCE AND

     Ichiro's wife, dressed in a formal kimono, watch the
     ceremony.

                                         CUT TO:

     INT.  JAPANESE RESTAURANT - TOKYO - DAY

     Joyce and Nick are sitting alone at a table.  Nick's left
     arm in in a sling.

                         NICK
               Can't make you change your mind?

                         JOYCE
               Last time you asked me to come along
               I nearly got a hole in my head.

                         NICK
               Might be different in New York.

                         JOYCE
               Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find
               out.

                         NICK
               I'd like that.

     Ich sits down with two fresh bowls of soba noodles.  Nick
     hesitates.

                         ICH
               You can do it.

     Nick picks up his chopsticks with his good hand.  He
     begins to slurp the noodles.

                         ICH
               Louder, pal, louder.

                         NICK
               Joyce, give the assistant Chief
               Inspector a drink, would you?

     As Joyce refills all their cups we...

                                         SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT.  EIGHT THREE PRECINCT - NEW YORK CITY - DAY

     It's raining.  A sun shower.


     INT.  POLICE STATION

     Capt. Oliver is standing by the window watching the rain
     pour down.

                         OLIVER
               ... Remember, counterfeiting is the
               Feds.  They'll be all over
               Abolofia's place.  Stick tight.
               You I.D. the other plate, he does
               real time.

                         NICK
               Right.

     Reveal Nick sitting in front of Oliver's desk, his one arm
     is still in a sling.  Nick gets to his feet.

                         OLIVER
                    (still not facing
                     him)
               You know, Nick, if you'd held on to
               that plate, you could've been a very
               rich man.

     Oliver turns to face Nick.  Nick just looks at him, then:

                         NICK
               Never crossed my mind.

     Oliver nods; he believes him.

                         OLIVER
               Be careful on the run.

                                         CUT TO:

     INT.  SQUAD BAY - NIGHT

     In contrast to the Japanese police station -- it's chaos.
     Cops are in every imaginable kind of dress, trash cans
     over flow, a handcuffed prisoner screams abuse to anyone
     who will listen.

     THE RAIDING PARTY

     a dozen men in all, are donning flak jackets and
     windbreakers with POLICE and TREASURY stenciled on the
     back.

     NICK

     walks in with two heavy bullet proof vests slung over his
     shoulder.  He squeezes past the raiding party to find

     ICH

     sitting at a desk, thumbing through a Frommer's guide to
     New York City.  Nick drops one of the vests on the desk.
     It lands like a ton of bricks.  Ich continues to read.

     A Sergeant walks in.

                         SERGEANT
               Saddle up.  Hard team in the first
               unit.  Conklin, your RMP awaits.

     The cops and treasury men, grabbing their gear, head for
     the door.

     Nick is struggling to get into his vest using one arm.

                         NICK
               Sure you want to come?  Probably
               better than the Greyline Tour.

     Ich stands up, shoves the guidebook in his back pocket.
     He helps Nick fasten the strap in back.

                         ICH
               You wouldn't make it without me.

     Nick smiles, takes the Frommer's out of Ich's pocket and
     tosses it into the trash.

     Nick hands him a shotgun, takes another one off the rack
     for himself.

     We watch from behind as the two men head down the long
     hallway toward the exit.

                         ICH
               Think we'll get him, Nick?

                         NICK
               We can't lose.

                         ICH
               How can you be so sure?

     Nick opens the door at the far end of the hallway.  They
     step out into the sunlit rain.

                         NICK
               Cause you're the biggest thing to
               hit this town since...

     Before Nick can finish his line, the door SLAMS SHUT
     behind them.

                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                         THE END
