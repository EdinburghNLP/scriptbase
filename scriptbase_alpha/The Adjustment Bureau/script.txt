          BLACK SCREEN

          The sounds of a large crowd, but muffled, as if we're inside,
          and hearing the crowd through a window or door. FADE IN ON:

          INT. SOME SORT OF LOBBY -- DAY

          DAVID NORRIS, 33, is having a private moment, looking down,
          thinking. He wears a suit and tie. He seems relaxed and
          confident. Content. Completely in his element.
          In one of his hands he's absentmindedly twirling a couple of
          individually-wrapped Ricola throat lozenges. We hear the
          muffled voice of someone on a PA system outside:

          VOICE ON PA SYSTEM
          Thank you so much for coming today--
          A man in a BLUE BLAZER walks up to David.

                         BLUE BLAZER
          Congressman Norris-?
          Now REVEAL that we're Â±fl: the entry hall of the Admin Building
          at St. Johns University. A thousand people crowd the quad
          out front. "Norris for Senate" placards everywhere.

                         BLUE-BLAZER
          Fred O'Malley with the DNC. I've
          never seen a crowd this big turn
          out so early in the cycle.
          CHARLIE TRAYNOR, 36, arrives--.

                         CHARLIE
          Just wait 'till you see how they
          respond to him..
          David pops a cherry lozenge into his mouth and straightens
          his lapel pin, which is shaped like New York State.

                         DAVID
          Don't build me up like that,
          Charlie. He'll be disappointed.

          EXT. ST. JOHNS UNIVERSITY -- MAIN QUAD -- DAY

          The crowd, many of them in their twenties, roars with
          approval as David walks out to the lectern on the steps of
          the Admin Building.

                         DAVID
          Hi there. I'm David Norris. And
          I'm running for the US Senate.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 2.
          The crowd goes wild.

          MONTAGE -- SENATE CAMPAIGN
          --David finishes a speech at the FDNY Academy's graduation.
          The cadets jump to their feet and give him a standing
          ovation.
          --David shakes the hands of workers entering a .Con Edison
          plant in Buffalo. He's a natural at this. Unlike most
          politicians he actually seems to enjoy campaigning.
          --Flashbulbs go off as he plays a game of pick-up basketball
          with a group of Bronx teenagers. Charlie is nearby.
          --David takes a ceremonial shovel full of dirt to begin
          redevelopment of an old military base upstate.
          --He gives a speech at a Harlem church. Audiences watch
          David the way they watched JFK, the way they watch Obama
          today. He inspires, makes them believe, makes them want to
          follow him. Especially young people.
          --David walks through a suburban mall happily shaking hands
          as cameras follow him and citizens snap pictures with their
          camera-phones. People crush around him. He:doesn't seem to
          mind at all. He welcomes it. He feeds off it.
          --He pops a cherry lozenge in his mouth and climbs up onto a
          tractor to speak to a gathering of upstate farmers, speaking
          into a bullhorn to compensate for his hoarse voice. Charlie
          stands nearby watching him speak:.

          INT. SHERATON HOTEL ROOM --UPSTATE SOMEWHERE -- DUSK

          David enters his hotel room. The silence contrasts starkly
          with the noisy energy of the campaign trail.
          He turns on the TV. Scrolls through the channels. After a
          moment shuts it off. Total silence again. It bothers him.
          He opens up his briefcase. Pulls out a thick file -- his
          itinerary for the next three days. Dozens of speeches and
          meetings across the state.
          He glances at the summary page on the top. Glances down the
          page with his finger, stopping, almost at random, on a speech
          he's giving two days from now at the Westchester County Open
          Space Initiative.

                         DAVID

                         (TESTING HIMSELF)
          Karen Woods, founder. Husband:
          Bob.

                         

                         

                         

                         

           2/12/09 3.

          Ricky, Little League. John Pascal.
          Wife: Anna. St. John's grad. Two
          year old: Loyita...
          He stops. Knows this cold. His finger runs down to a
          Realtor's Association breakfast in Nassau County four days
          out.

                         DAVID

                         (MORE TESTING)
          Abagail "Abby" Best, Stuart
          Broxterman, Chapel Davis, Milan
          Sabovic, Jim Vargas...
          His ability to retain this sort of information is stunning.
          He doesn't need to review. It's already all there.
          He closes his itinerary file. Goes to the window and looks
          out at the trees.
          The silence back...it's deafening.

          INT. SHERATON LOBBY -- UPSTATE SOMEWHERE -- NIGHT

          Charlie enters the lobby. Stops suddenly: spots David,
          holding court at`the hotel bar. Fifteen strangers around him
          as he regales them with a story, despite the fact that he's
          clearly losing his voice. Charlie walks over, pulls him
          aside.

                         CHARLIE
          What the hell? What happened to
          "I'm going to have softie tea, rest
          my voice, and go to bed early?"
          You have Diane Sawyer tomorrow and
          you have to be up at four AM for us
          to make it in time.
          David is holding ,a beer, in his left hand. With his free hand
          he picks up a cup and saucer.

                         DAVID
          I had some tea.
          (sees Charlie's not in the

                         MOOD)
          Come on, man. We're eight points
          up in the polls. I've gotta cut
          loose every once in a while and
          have a life.
          This provokes a quizzical look from Charlie. Fifteen
          strangers in a crappy upstate Sheraton doesn't seem like
          having a life to him...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 4.

                         CHARLIE
          Ten.

                         DAVID
          What?

                         CHARLIE
          Latest poll has you ten points up.
          A slow smile spreads across David's face.

                         CUT TO:

                         BLACK SCREEN
          The sound of a busy room. Then one voice, much louder:

          CAMPAIGN AIDE.
           County reporting: 8901 for
          Lynfield, 7233 for Norris.

          INT. WALDORF ASTORIA HOTEL SUITE -- NIGHT

          Charlie Traynor walks over to the aide who just shouted that.
          She's writing vote totals onto a map of New York by county.

                         CHARLIE

                         (NATURAL OPTIMIST)
          Better than I thought, I thought
          we'd get killed in Seneca.
          He turns to look at a large suite full of more than a dozen
          Norris supporters talking on phones and typing into laptops.

                         CHARLIE
          Eddie, call Boyd! Where the hell
          are the. Suffolk numbers? We've got
          to get the Suffolk numbers!

          EXT. ROOFTOP NEAR WALDORF -- NIGHT

          A light snow falls. Four MEN IN CONSERVATIVE SUITS,
          overcoats, and fedoras walk across the roof of a forty-story
          building. Their clothing is more timeless than old-
          fashioned. And somehow so is their demeanor.
          The men get to the edge and look down over the city, almost-
          as if it's their domain.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 5.

          INT. WALDORF HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

          David watches the election coverage on TV. Pundits are
          discussing the New York Senate race, which CNN has already
          called for David's opponent.

                         PUNDIT #1
          Congressman Norris has a reputation
          for being very direct, even blunt,
          in his campaign speeches, which is
          great until you say too many things
          you wish you hadn't. Then you
          start to look like an amateur.

                         PUNDIT #2
          That's bad for any candidate but
          it's fatal if you're running for
          Senate at the age of 33, your
          opponent keeps calling you an
          "impulsive kid," and you almost
          killed your entire political career
          five months ago with an act of
          immaturity that ended up on the
          front page of`.the New York Post.
          David winces slightly. This is excruciating. Just then
          Charlie enters.. The nerve center.suite is visible through
          the open door behind him.

                         -CHARLIE
          Why are you still watching CNN?
          They called this way too early.
          David doesn't share his friend's optimism.

          INT. WALDORF HOTEL SUITE'-- NERVE CENTER -- NIGHT

          A' campaign aide with a phone to her ear shouts to the room:

                         AIDE
          Suffolk County Numbers!
          Charlie and David emerge from the private room to listen.

           AIDE (O.S.)
          Lynfield: 415,120. Norris:

          370,233.
          Charlie's energy and optimism disappear instantly.

                         CHARLIE
          (after long beat)
          I really thought we'd win Suffolk.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 6.
          A senior aide walks over.

                         SENIOR AIDE
          Kings County just came in too.

                         A BRUTAL
          He shows a piece of paper to Charlie and David.
          beat...

                         DAVID
          Well, it's over. And it's going to
          be a blowout...
          David puts on a brave face. . .but this is the first moment
          that he realizes not only is he going to lose, but he's going
          to lose big. It's going to be a grand,. public humiliation.

                         SENIOR AIDE
          NBC has us up next.
          Charlie takes a clicker and turns the closest TV to NBC.

                         BRIAN WILLIAMS
          Turning now to the New York Senate
          race, NBC is now calling the
          election for Roger'Lynfield. After
          a shockingly poor showing in both
          Suffolk county and in his home
          county, Kings, it now appears that
          David Norris will lose this
          election badly, perhaps by as much
          as 10 points.

          EXT. ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

          The four men in dark suits.. The boss's name is RICHARDSON,
          early 40s. His top aide is.AHARRY, 50s.

                         RICHARDSON
          This is a.bignight, gentleman.

                         (TOHARRY)
          Is ever ything set?
          Harry nods. Richardson notices his eyes:

                         RICHARDSON
          You look tired. You should take a
          vacation when we finish with this.
          You'll have earned it.

                         HARRY
          I'm not sure the kind of tired I
          feel would be fixed by a vacation.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 7.

                         RICHARDSON
          Sure it would. Everybody needs a
          vacation. Even us.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. WALDORF HOTEL SUITE -- NERVE CENTER -- NIGHT

          The staff and supporters in here have become very quiet.
          Their candidate is standing in the middle of the room, but no
          one can look at him. And David can't look at them either...

                         DAVID

                         (TO CHARLIE)
          I'm going to take a walk, figure
          out my speech.

          INT. GRAND BALLROOM -- NIGHT

          Four-hundred campaign workers follow election news on big
          screens in the Waldorf's Grand Ballroom. No one says a word.
          The mood has gone from.hopeful to funereal in sixty seconds.

          INT. WALDORF LOBBY -- NIGHT

          David slips through the lobby with only a few looks from the
          staff. But when he.gets to the door he sees that press vans
          line the front of the hotel. There will be no peace for him
          if he steps out there. He turns around.

                         ASSISTANT MANAGER
          Good evening, Congressman. You're
          in the Grand Ballroom if that's
          what you're looking for.

                         DAVID
          Actually just looking for a place
          to be alone for a minute before I
          head in there.

                         ASSISTANT MANAGER
          None of the banquet rooms on the
          third floor are in use tonight.

                         DAVID
          Thank you.

          INT. EMPTY BANQUET ROOM -- NIGHT

          David stands alone looking out at the empty room. Trying to
          get used to it. It's not easy.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 8.

          INT. MEN'S ROOM -- NIGHT

           David enters the huge, ornate, men's room and goes to the row
          of sinks. He pulls two Ricola cherry lozenges from his
          pocket. He twirls them in his hands for a moment.
          Then tosses them into the trash can. He looks at himself in
          the mirror, fighting to hold himself together.
          A sound behind him. David spins to see a WOMAN exiting one
          of the stalls. She's in a stunning ball gown and carrying an
          expensive bottle of champagne.

                         WOMAN
          Hi. I hope I didn't startle you.

                         DAVID
          What are you doing in here?

                         WOMAN
          Hiding from security.

                         DAVID
          Oh... . What did you do?

                         WOMAN
          Crashed a wedding. One floor up.

                         DAVID
          It's almost midnight. They'just
          caught on now?

                         WOMAN
          Ivana Trump finally realized I
          wasn't her niece. I think after
          the fifth; glass of champagne my
          Czech accent started slipping.
          spite of David's state that gets a grin.

                         DAVID
          Are you for real?

                         WOMAN
          Life is short.

                         DAVID
          Hard to argue with that.

                         WOMAN
          You're that guy running for Senate
          aren't you?

                         DAVID
          I'm "that guy."

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 9.

                         WOMAN
          You winning?

                         DAVID
          No.

                         WOMAN
          Too bad. The other guy's a tool.

                         DAVID

                         (LAUGHS)
          Maybe I should have made that
          clearer in my ads.

                         WOMAN
          Personally, I think mooning your
          friends at a college reunion is no
          big deal.

                         (BEAT)
          And I don't think the Post should
          have printed the photo.
          David just shakes his head. He will never, ever live that
          down and he knows it.

                         WOMAN
          At least not full page.
          He can't help but crack up.

                         WOMAN
          Listen, I've done it.

                         DAVID
          You weren't running, for Senate at
          the time.

                         WOMAN
          Do you still have a chance or is it
          over?

                         DAVID
          He crushed me.
          She has beautiful eyes. And an exceptional gift for
          conveying empathy...

                         WOMAN
          You must ...I don't know what you
          must be feeling...

                         DAVID
          Winning would feel better. But
          losing has its advantages.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 10.

                         WOMAN
          Like what?

                         DAVID
          The only time a politician is alone
          is when he's asleep.. .or in the
          bathroom. After eight years in
          politics that gets kind of hard to
          take.
          She tilts her head a little, gives him a curious look.

                         WOMAN
          Watching you, you'd never know it.
          The way she looks at him, the way she says it, David knows
          she sees what others miss in him -- even if he isn't even
          quite sure what it is. Not yet.

                         DAVID
          Thank you...

                         WOMAN
          Well, everything happens for a
          reason, right? Even losing. God,
          I'm really rollrng out the
          platitudes tonight, aren't I?

                         DAVID
          It's the champagne. Brines out the
          Hallmark in people.

                         WOMAN
          After it kills their Czech accents.
          She offers:him the bottle. He hesitates, then takes it.

                         DAVID
          Why not? I have to think up some
          good platitudes for my speech.
          He takes a gulp of champagne.

                         WOMAN
          Why the hell would you do that?

                         DAVID
          Apparently, even if I hadn't been
          caught dropping my drawers in the
          middle of a senate campaign I would
          have lost the election anyway
          because I'm too blunt.

                         WOMAN
          (swig of champagne)
          Says who?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 11.

                         DAVID
          The TV pundits.

                         WOMAN
          Fuck 'em. They just wish they had
          the balls to be candidates
          themselves.
          She hands him the champagne bottle again.

                         WOMAN
          And they work for the Man anyway.

                         (BEAT)
          You going to run again?

                         DAVID

                         (DRINKS)
          Tonight's probably not the night to
          ask.

                         WOMAN

                         (FINGER POINTING)
          No, it is. Look at me. You have
          to run again. Do-yo hear me?
          She's serious about this. Intense.

                         WOMAN
          Otherwise the-country will be run
          by tools. like Lynwood.

                         DAVID
          "Field."
          (of f her look)
          "Lynfield."
          A beat. She shrugs.
          Then they lean toward each other... and kiss. It turns more
          and more passionate. When they finally pull apart:

                         DAVID
          Holy shit.
          She seems just as surprised. They look at each other and
          laugh.
          Just then the bathroom door opens. It's Charlie. He sees
          David and the woman.

                         CHARLIE
          David?

                         WOMAN

                         (SUDDENLY EMBARRASSED)
          I better go.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 12.
          She exits.

                         DAVID

                         WAIT--

          INT. 3RD FLOOR BALLROOM AREA

          The woman comes out of the bathroom. David is right behind
          her. Then Charlie.

                         DAVID
          Wait.
          The woman turns to face David. Suddenly two hotel guards
          turn the corner and spot the woman.

                         HOTEL SECURITY
          There!
          They rush toward her.

                         WOMAN
          Gotta go.
          (to David, emphatically.)
          Don't let the bastards grind you
          down.
          She spins and sprints away. The hotel guards chase her.

                         CHARLIE
          What the hell was that?

                         DAVID
          I'm really not sure.
          David has a huge grin on his face.

                         DAVID
          But I think I'm ready to give my
          speech.

          INT. GRAND BALLROOM -- NIGHT

          David as he walks out from behind a curtain onto the dais.
          His supporters start clapping... . but clearly they're
          heartbroken. David looks completely peaceful.

                         DAVID
          I grew up in Red Hook and I don't
          want to shock anybody but I got in
          a few fist fights along the way.
          Laughter ripples through the crowd. We don't know enough yet
          to get the joke.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 13.

                         DAVID
          And we used to have a saying when
          you got in a fight: "it's not
          whether or not you get knocked down
          -- because eventually everyone does
          -- it's what you do when you get
          back up."

                         (BEAT)
          Don't worry, I'm not going to moon
          you.
          The audience explodes with laughter this time.

                         DAVID
          But I am...
          (waiting for the laughter
          to die down)
          But I am going to get backup. I
          wanted to come out here tonight and
          give you a victory speech, a speech
          I've dreamed of giving foremost of
          my life. But life doesn't always
          deal you the cards you want.
          The audience sobered now. Reflective.

                         DAVID
          My life changed when I was ten
          years old. My entire world turned
          upside-down.'
          His audience,. knows exactly what he's talking about.

                         DAVID
          And as I looked for something to
          -hang ;on to, something; to help me
          cope' with what had. happened the
          only thing that made sense to me
          was service. Finding a way to do
          something with my life that left
          this world a little better than I
          found it.
          The audience is moved. Tears begin to well up. People dab
          at their eyes.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. MADISON SQ. PARK -- PRE DAWN

          The sky is just beginning to turn from black to deep blue.
          The park is still and silent.
          A black Mercedes pulls up on Madison Ave. Mr. Richardson,
          again in a dark suit, gets out and enters the park.

          EXT. PARK BENCH -- PRE DAWN

          Harry sits on one of the benches -- a fedora in his lap to
          complement a gray flannel suit. Richardson arrives.

                         RICHARDSON
          He spills his coffee when he steps
          out of Starbucks. The moment he
          comes through the door.

                         HARRY
          Got it.

                         RICHARDSON
          Our models indicate between 7:00
          and 7:05 am.
          Harry nods but he seems distant Richardson sees this.

                         RICHARD SON
          You planned that vacation, right?

                         HARRY
          Two weeks.
          Richardson claps him din-the shoulder and leaves. Harry
          watches him go.

          INT. BEDROOM -- MORNING

          An alarm clock reads "5:44 airy." It turns to "5:45" and the
          alarm goes off. A hand reaches over and taps the alarm off.
          FOLLOW the arm back to David Norris in a king-sized bed. He
          rubs his eyes, stretches his neck, and climbs out of bed.

          No...

          INT. BUS -- MORNING

          As David walks down the aisle a couple of passengers
          recognize his face. . .but they don't say anything.
          David nears an empty aisle seat. A woman is curled up in the
          window seat, sleeping. She wears a funky mini-dress, knee-
          high argyle socks under leather boots, and a (clashing)
          argyle bucket cap.
          David sits next to her. And stares.

                         DAVID
          No way...
          It's the woman from election night.', He leans around to try
          to see the front of her face. "It's definitely her. His
          eyes drift down at her legs. Just then she opens her eyes.
          She recoils for a second;. Then` her eyes soften when she
          realizes who it is.

                         DAVID

                         (MOMENTARLY SELF-

                         CONSCIOUS)
          I think. we "ve met.

                         WOMAN

                         (DEADPAN)
          You need a better line than that or
          I'll have to assume you're a
          pervert who likes to stare at
          girls' legs while-, they sleep.

                         DAVID
          (smiles, game on)
          Your skirt was so short I couldn't
          help it.

                         WOMAN
          Dress.

                         DAVID
          Skirt, dress, same thing.

                         WOMAN
          If you're a pervert, yeah. All
          that matters is they both show leg.

                         DAVID
          So do shorts, dear.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 18.

                         WOMAN
          Yeah, but there's that pesky piece
          of fabric right here that
          interferes with your fantasy life.
          She shuts her eyes and leans against the window.

                         WOMAN
          Wake me when you have a good come
          back to that.

                         DAVID
          I have one but, unlike you, I
          wouldn't say it in public.

                         WOMAN
          (eyes still closed)
          Pussy.
          David laughs. Can not believe this woman. In a good way.
          His blackberry RINGS. Her eyes pop open. David.picks up.

                         DAVID
          Hello...? Hello?
          David looks at his. phone. The signal has gone to zero.

                         DAVID

                         (TO WOMAN)
          The line cut.

                         WOMAN
          That ringer get any-louder or do
          you pretty much have it maxed out?

                         DAVID
          You're relentless.

                         WOMAN
          I never sleep through the night. I
          catch up on the bus.

                         (BEAT)
          You going to run again?

                         DAVID
          I just started a new job, today.

                         WOMAN

                         (SERIOUS NOW)
          I saw your concession speech. I
          heard Bill Clinton called it the
          best political speech he's seen in
          20 years.
          David looks back at her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 19.

                         DAVID
          Something got into me.
          He means her. They stare at each other.

                         DAVID
          What's the deal with you and
          argyles?

                         WOMAN
          What's the deal with you and boring
          shades of blue?
          David is wearing a Navy blue suit, blue shirt, and blue tie.
          A beat.

                         DAVID
          At least my clothes match.

                         WOMAN
          That's easy if you. restrict
          yourself to one color.

                         DAVID
          The belt and shoes are black.

                         WOMAN
          Variety is the spice of .life .

                         DAVID
          There you` go with the platitudes
          again. I guess it wasn't the
          ch mpagne .
          His blackberry goes again. RING-RING.

                         DAVID
          Hello? Hello?
          He shakes his head. It's dead again.

          EXT. BROADWAY AND 19TH STREET -- MORNING

           Harry runs down Broadway looking east on 19th to try to spot
          the bus on Park.

          INT. BUS --MORNING


                          WOMAN
          Your phone sucks. Don't guys like
          you get special phones that
          actually work in the middle of the
          biggest city in the country?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 20.

                         DAVID
          Depends what the telecom lobby
          thinks of your voting record.

          EXT. BROADWAY AND 19TH STREET -- MORNING

          Harry spots the bus passing on Park. He jams his fedora on
          his head and stretches his arm out--

                         HARRY
          Now.

          INT. BUS -- MORNING

          David's phone rings again. As he reaches for the phone he
          fumbles his coffee cup, the lid comes off, and a slosh of
          coffee crests the brim and splashes on the woman's dress.

                         DAVID
          Oh, Jesus...

                         (FIGHTING LAUGHTER)
          I'm sorry.

          EXT. BROADWAY AND 19TH -- MORNING

          Harry's face.

                         HARRY
          Shit!
          He's looking at a leather portfolio. We catch a glimpse
          inside: a complicated circuit diagram. Harry shuts the
          book, look's up to get a bead on" the the bus, then takes off down
          Broadway, again, hoping to cut it off at Union Square.

          INT.'BUS -- MORNING


                         DAVID
          I'll pay for the damage.
          He pulls out his wallet. There's $7 inside. She laughs.

                         WOMAN
          Hope your new job pays better than
          your old one.

                         DAVID
          Give me your number and I'll send
          you a check.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 21.

                         WOMAN
          God, that is smooth. Spill coffee
          on me then ask for my number.
          She takes the coffee from his hands and casually takes a sip,
          then turns back to him with a devilish look in her eyes.

                         WOMAN
          Just let me spill some on you and
          we'll be even.
          She thrusts the cup toward his tie. David parries.

                         DAVID
          It's my first day at the office!

                         WOMAN
          Tell your boss some crazy chick
          dumped coffee on you on the MI.
          It's New York; he'll understand.
          She thrusts the cup back at him-

                         DAVID
          No!
          He grabs the cup with both his hands over hers.

                         WOMAN

                         (ACTUALLY PLEADING)
          Come on. Just a little.
          They struggle with the cup. <,;:Both suppressing laughter.

                         DAVID
          You're crazy. Actually crazy.
          The phone on David's lap'RINGS again. She snatches it with
          her free hand.

                         WOMAN

                         (INTO PHONE)
          He's not here!
          She hangs up.

                         DAVID
          Who was that?
          She shrugs. Sorry, pal. He lunges for his phone, but she
          holds it on the other side of her body.

                         DAVID
          What is this, third grade?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 22.

                         WOMAN
          You forgot what that was like,
          didn't you? How fun it was...
          That stops him for a moment. Until the phone RINGS again.

                         WOMAN
          Oh my God! How do you stand it?
          She drops the phone into the coffee.

                         WOMAN
          There. We're even.
          He stares at her. Incredulous. They lock eyes. God knows
          what would come next if they were in private...
          The fourth RING gurgles up through the coffee. A beat.

                         WOMAN
          Sturdy little fucker, isn't it?
          She pulls the phone out of the cup and wipes it off with her
          scarf, pushing the button which sends the call to voice mail.
          Then she reaches out her hand, as if to shake.

                         WOMAN
          By the way, I'm Elise.

          EXT. UNION SQUARE -- DAY

          Elise exits.. the bus. David stands at the bus door watching
          her. She turns back to look at him.

                         DAVID
          The morning after .I lost I woke up
          thinking about you .
          That melts her. Instantly. All her bravado drops.

          INT. BUS -- MORNING

          Moments later. Through the window, David watches Elise
           walking down the sidewalk. Their eyes meet. She blows him
           a little kiss before she turns the corner. His heart skips
          a beat as the bus continues on down Union Square East.

          EXT. UNION SQUARE -- MORNING

          Harry runs through Union Square bee-lining for David's bus.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 23.

          INT. BUS -- MORNING

          David looks at Elise's number, scribbled on a piece of paper.
          He carefully tucks her number into his wallet. Then takes
          the most satisfying sip of coffee he's ever had in his life--

          EXT. UNION SQUARE -- MORNING

          Spotting David through the bus window, Harry thrusts his
          Fedora back onto his head and points at the bus--

          INT. BUS -- MORNING

          Just as David finishes his sip the-plastic lid pops off the
          cup. A second earlier and the coffee would have poured all
          over his shirt. Instead it spills: on the floor.

          EXT. UNION SQUARE -- MORNING


                         HARRY
          Dammit!
          Harry sprints out onto lark Avenue now, right behind the bus--
          HONK! Harry turns just in time to see a.taxi skid into him.
          TRUNK! He rolls up onto the hood--

          INT. RSR CAPITAL -- CHARLIE'S OFFICE -- MORNING

          A big corner office. The phone rings. Charlie picks up.

          DAVID (TEL. V.O.)
          Guess who I just sat down next to
          on the bus?

          INTERCUTTING WITH CHARLIE

                         CHARLIE
          Who?

                         DAVID
          The woman from election night.

          EXT. PARK AVENUE SOUTH -- MORNING

          A dazed Harry lies in the road... The taxi driver who hit
          him jumps out of his car to see if Harry is okay...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 24.

          INT. BUS -- MORNING


           CHARLIE (TEL. V.O.)
          The one you kissed?

                         DAVID
          She kissed me. I just didn't
          fight it.

          EXT. PARK AVENUE SOUTH -- MORNING

          Harry sits up... He's bruised but okay. He looks around for
          something. Spots his crushed hat under the taxi's front
          tire.

          INT. BUS -- MORNING


           CHARLIE (O.S.)
          You're shitting me. Just randomly
          you sit down next to--
          He's cut off mid-word.

                         DAVID
          Charlie?
          David looks at his phone. "Call Lost" on the screen. David
          hits redial. Gets a fast busy.

                         DAVID
          ' (to himself).
          This is ridiculous.
          He pockets his phone.

          EXT. PARK AVENUE SOUTH MORNING

          The taxi driver is with Harry now.

                         TAXI DRIVER
          Are you okay?
          Harry is sitting now, wincing, but still searching intently
          for something.

                         HARRY
          I'm fine-- Will you hand me that?
           Harry points at his leather portfolio on the pavement a few
          feet away. We'll come to know it as a "PLANBOOK."

                         

                         

                         

                         

           2/12/09 25.

          TAXI DRIVER (CONT'D)
          Are you sure you're okay?
          The driver hands it to him. Harry flips to a bookmarked
          page and we get our first good look at that circuit diagram:
          Thousands of interconnected lines. Dozens of geometric
          symbols at intersection points. And written notations in a
          language as complex as Sanskrit crossed with Chinese.
          And, maybe it's just a trick of the light but several of the
          lines appear to re-arrange themselves on the page.

                         HARRY
          Oh...shit...

          EXT. CITY STREET -- MORNING

          David's still grinning as he reaches his downtown office
          tower. He enters through the revolving door--

          INT. DAVID'S OFFICE BUILDING'-- GROUND FLOOR LOBBY -- MORNING

          Empty, except for a bored-looking security guard at the other
          end of the lobby. David gets into an empty elevator.

          INT. 41ST FLOOR LOBBY -- MORNING

          David walks past the receptionist She's on the phone. He
          waves as-he:passes by. No wade back. She must not see him.

                         DAVID
          Okay...
          Daviddecides he doesn't need to announce himself.

          INT. RSR CAPITAL OFFICES -- MORNING

           David enters to find the office suite quiet... Not a soul
          in sight. Not a single secretary is here.

                         DAVID
          (loud, playful)
          Doesn't anybody bother getting in
          before eight at this place?
          David passes a couple of empty offices on his way towards a
          large corner suite where a secretary sits outside an office
          marked "Charles Traynor, Chairman." She's smiling.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 26.

                         DAVID (CONT'D)

                         (EXUBERANT)
          Susan! How are you today?
          (when she doesn't move)
          Susan?
          David looks closer across her desk. Her face is frozen.

                         DAVID (CONT'D)
          Susan?
          He leans across her desk, touches her arm. She stays dead
          still. David rushes through Charlie's door:

                         DAVID
          Call 911! Something's wrong with
          Susan!

          INT. CHARLIE'S OFFICE -- MORNING

          --and rushes in to find that Charlie is frozen too -- with
          the phone up to his ear. Like he's in a wax museum.
          He is surrounded by four men in bulky, metallic silver
          protective suits .(think airport firefighter gear).
          One of the men adjusts three metal. probes which are attached
          to the left side.of Charlie's skull.

                         DAVID
          Jesus!
          Three men in business suits talking by the window spin to see
          David. it's Mr. Richardson and-two aides we recognize as the
          "security guards" who chased Elise away on election night.

          DAVID (,.CONT'D)
          What the hell are you doing?!
          Richardson blinks Clearly surprised. Then:

                         RICHARDSON
          Grab him!
          David bolts out of the office as they lunge at him--

          INT. RSR OFFICE FLOOR -- MORNING

          David sprints toward the door he came in. It closes as he
          gets there. He grabs it. It's locked.
          He sprints away into an internal hallway. Richardson emerges
          from a door in the middle of the hallway.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 27.
          David jumps a mile. It's physically impossible that
          Richardson could have gotten there that fast.

                         RICHARDSON
          You can't get away, David.
          David spins and rushes back into the main office, then down
          an internal staircase to the floor below. Jumps the last
          five steps and hits the floor hard.
          As he comes up he runs smack into another RSR employee who is
          frozen solid.
          David curses, then dives around the frozen employee to find
          Richardson, coming out of another office. down the hall.
          Again, physically impossible for him to get there that fast--
          David spins and-- A DISTORTED WIDE ANGLE SHOT of a
          chloroform rag shoved right at us. FOCUS GOES IN AND OUT...
          FROM DAVID'S POV, BLURRY FOCUS as he's carried toward one of
          the large corner offices on the 40th floor.
          The nameplate reads "Steve Kincaid."
          Richardson opens the door and ushers his men, carrying David,

                         INSIDE --
           Except when they walk through the door they're not in an
          office 40 floors above lower Manhattan,: they step inside a
          large warehouse...
          Their movement completely violates the laws of physics.

                         BLACK SCREEN
          Silence. Then voices come up slowly:

          RICHARDSON (O.S.)
          Yes, sir. No, sir. No, sir. I
          understand that, sir. Absolutely.
          I'll do that, sir.

                         (BEAT)
          What a goddamm mess.

          MCCRADY (O.S.)
          Was that Donaldson?

          RICHARDSON (O.S.)
          Yes.

          MCCRADY (O.S.)
          What do you want to do?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 28.
           FADE UP -- BLURRY AT FIRST -- to DAVID'S POV of the warehouse
          David caught a glimpse of just before he passed out.
          A half-dozen members of the "Intervention Team" (the Silver
          Suits) stand nearby. Richardson and MCCRADY (one of the men
          from the rooftops) stand behind David, about 20 feet away.

          RICHARDSON (O.S.)
          Can you reset him?

          MCCRADY (O.S.)
          I don't think we have the authority
          in a situation like this.

          RICHARDSON (O.S.)

                         CALL LEGAL-

          BURDENSKY (0.S.).
          Legal just arrived.

          INT. WAREHOUSE -- DAY

          REVEAL BURDENSKY, a 50 year-old in a pin-stripe suit,
          carrying a briefcase. He.walks to Richardson.

                         BURDENSKY
          Re-setting's off the table. This
          is our fault:...
          Richardson glances irately at Harry, who stands by himself
          off to the side, clearly disgraced.
          David, who is tied to a chair facing away from Richardson,
          cranes around to see who's talking.

                         DAVID
          Hey.
          The suits stare back in silence for a beat, then turn back to
          talking amongst themselves -- though at a lower volume.

                         RICHARDSON
          What are my options?

                         BURDENSKY

                         (IGNORING DAVID)
          You could bullshit him but you'll
          never be completely successful.

                         DAVID
          Can somebody tell me what's going
          on?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 29.

                         BURDENSKY
          (still ignoring him)
          The questions will burn in him till
          the day he dies. You'll have to
          monitor him constantly...

                         ON DAVID
          He can hear little snippets of what Burdensky's saying--

          BURDENSKY (PARTIALLY AUDIBLE)
          .to make sure he doesn't talk...
          the endless ripple effects...
          REVEAL David untying the rope restraining him.

          ON THE SUITS

                         BURDENSKY
          If it were me, I'd level with him.

                         RIC:HARDSON
          Completely?

                         BURDENSKY
          That's the only way to extinguish
          his curiosity.
          Richardson turns and studies David. Then walks over to him.
          An uncomfortable pause.

                         DAVID
          Who are you guys?

                         RICHARDSON
          We're the people v ho make sure
          things happen according to Plan.
          David stares back at him for a moment.
          then leaps up. His rope comes off and the chair falls. He
          sprints toward an open door forty feet across the warehouse.
          Richardson makes a little gesture with his hand--

          CLOSE-UP OF THE FLOOR
          It cracks.. .and displaces upward.. .so it's uneven just as
          David's foot comes down on it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 30.

          BACK TO WIDE SHOT
          David trips and goes flying--

                         MOMENTS LATER
          David is dragged back to the center of the room and placed
          back in his chair in front of Richardson.

                         RICHARDSON
          Did you really think I couldn't see
          that coming?
          David dabs blood from his lip, which split during the fall.

                         RICHARDSON (CONT'D)
          I can read your mind!
          David stares back.

                         RICHARDSON (CONT'D)
          Yeah, really...

                         (BEAT)
          Choose a color.
          (barely a beat)
          Blue. Choose a number.
          (even less time)
          Seventeen.
          David's jaw drops slightly. Richardson was clearly right.

                         RICHARDSON
          Now,. why are you still deciding
          whether or not to run?
          David's hands go to his head`, involuntarily, an atavistic
          response, as if;s.omehow that will keep his thoughts from
          spilling out into view.

                         RICHARDSON
          You saw the futility of that back
          at the office.
          David's entire reality has finally been bent to the breaking
          point. He can't hang on any longer to an explanation for all
          this based in the world he's known to date...

                         DAVID
          What the hell is happening to me?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 31.

                         RICHARDSON
          You just saw behind a curtain you
          weren't even supposed to know was
          there, Mr. Norris. Its jarring.
          I'm sure.

                         DAVID
          I just... came to work...

                         RICHARDSON
          It wasn't your fault. Your Path
          through the world this morning was
          supposed to be adjusted.
          (glancing bitterly at
          Harry, in the corner)
          Your coffee was supposed to.spill
          onto your shirt as you left
          Starbucks near your apartment.
          You would have gone up to change
          and arrived at work ten minutes
          later than you did. By then we
          would have left.

                         (BEAT)
          People call it "chance" when their
          coffee spills or their internet
          goes down or they misplace their
          keys. Sometimes it is. Sometimes
          it's:us...nudging you back on Plan.
          David takes all this in. He's still shell-shocked.

                         DAVID
          Whatever you were doing to Charlie
          back there... it wasn't misplacing
          his keys.

                         RICHARDSON
          Sometimes. when nudging a person
          back on Plan isn't enough we
          intervene directly.

                         DAVID
          Why Charlie? What did you do to
          him.

                         RICHARDSON
          You need to worry about getting
          back on your Plan, David, not worry
          about us putting him back on his.
          David stares back, still trying to get his bearings.

                         RICHARDSON (CONT'D)
          Only a handful of human beings know
          what you now know, David. We're
          determined to keep it that way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

           2/12/09 32.

                         RICHARDSON (CONT'D)
          So before I let you go, you need to
          understand something: If you ever
          reveal our existence we will erase
          your brain. Your memories, your
          emotions, your entire personality
          will be expunged. Your friends and
          family will think you've gone
          crazy. You won't "think" anything
          because a blank slate can't
          "think."
          Davidstares back.

                         RICHARDSON
          Do you understand what I just said?

                         DAVID
          Yes...

                         RICHARDSON
          Not a word. Not one word about us.
          (long beat as he studies

                         DAVID'S FACE)
          okay ... . you're free to go.
          David stands there a monent..:.not sure it's real. Richardson
          points at the door. David walks toward it.
          Just then another man comes up to Richardson.

          NEW MAN IN SUIT
          There's awoman.

                         RICHARDSON

                         (SIGHS)
          There's always & Woman...
          Richardson motions;to his men.
          At.-THE DOOR
          Two men come through from outside and block David's exit.

                         DAVID
          He said I could go.

          CENTER OF ROOM

          NEW MAN IN SUIT
          You won't believe who she is.
          He holds open a Planbook for Richardson to see.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 33.

                         RICHARDSON
          How is that possible? Why didn't
          we get an alert?

          NEW MAN IN SUIT
          He wasn't supposed to be on that
          bus. He was supposed to be
          changing his shirt in his
          apartment... It was a controlled
          situation. It was supposed to be.
          The new man looks at Harry.

          AT THE DOOR
          David looks back at Richardson.

                         DAVID
          You said I could go.
          Richardson walks over to him.

          RIC,HARDSON
          You ran into a woman named Elise on
          the bus this morning?

                         DAVID
          (:going very still)
          Why does it'matter?

                         RICHARDSON
          You weren't ever supposed to see
          her again.

                         DAVID
          Why do you care.?

                         RICHARDSON
          Because, David, you can't be with
          her. And we didn't want to have to
          resort to this--
          Four big guys grab David and pull his arms backwards like
          prison guards incapacitating a prisoner. Richardson reaches
          into David's pocket and pulls out his wallet--

                         DAVID
          What the hell-- What are you--
          Richardson removes the piece of paper that Elise wrote her
          number on from David's wallet--

                         DAVID (CONT'D)

                         NO--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 34.
          Richardson places the wallet back in David's pocket, then
          pulls out a lighter--

                         DAVID (CONT'D)
          No!
          And burns Elise's number. David strains and tries to pull
          loose from the vice-like grip of the four Intervention Team
          men. But he can't get free.

                         DAVID (CONT'D)
          What is wrong with you people?!
          Richardson drops the paper on the floor and lets it burn.
          ON David's reaction CUT TO:

          EXT. WAREHOUSE -- DAY

          David exits through a steel door., it clangs shut behind him.
          He stands there unable to proceed for a long beat then starts
          walking to the corner to orient himself.
          Down one street he spots the Manhattan Bridge, down the other
          the Brooklyn Bridge. He's in DUMBO.

          INT. BROOKLYN COCKTAIL LOUNGE -- AFTERNOON

          David sits alone at the bar. His hand trembles slightly.

                         BARTENDER
          You're David Norris, right?

                         DAVID
          Ice water.

                         BARTENDER
          That's it?
          David nods. Harry arrives.

                         HARRY
          We should talk. But not here. Go
          back to work and I'll contact you
          later today with a place to meet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 35.

                         DAVID
          Okay.
          Harry can see that David is still very shaken.

                         HARRY
          The world's exactly the same as
          it's always been. You just
          understand it more completely now.

                         (BEAT)
          Hang on to what mattered before you
          knew any of this and you'll be
          fine.

          EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE -- DAY

          A thousand-yard stare on his face, David walks toward
          downtown Manhattan amid dozens of--pedestrian commuters.

          INT. RSR OFFICES -- DAY

          David enters. Stares at,,hisnew colleagues going about their
          business as if nothing happened.

          INT. 40TH FLOOR --:DAY

          David stands in ftontof the corner office labeled "Steve
          Kincaid." He hesitates, then opens it. He sees an empty
          office with a killer view of New-,York Harbor. It's strangely
          disorienting for him.

          SECRETARY(O.S.)
          Mr. IKincaid's in the finance
          meeting, Congressitan. Main
          conference room.
          David turns to see her.

                         DAVID
          Thanks.
          David walks away, still trying to get his bearings in the new
          reality he now knows. Charlie comes around a corner.

                         CHARLIE
          There you are. I called your cell
          ten times. You left me hanging.

                         DAVID
          Sorry...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 36.

                         CHARLIE
          (seeing the look in

                         DAVID'S EYES)
          Are you okay?
          (off David's nod)
          Come on, we're late. Happy first
          day by the way.
          They head towards the conference room.

                         CHARLIE
          You sure you're okay.

                         DAVID
          Fine. How about you?

                         CHARLIE
          Great. Why?

                         DAVID
          No headaches or--

                         CHARLIE
          I feel fantastic, -man. Is it just,
          me or is this an odd conversation?
          (off David" s non-response.)
          What the hell happened with the
          girl?

                         DAVID
          After the meeting.

          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM RSR CAPITAL DAY

          LONG SHOT from outside the building. The firm's partners sit
          at their weekly investment committee meeting. David watches
          Charlie intently, looking for what's changed...

          INT RSR CAPITAL OFFICES -- DAY
          David and Charlie walk back to David's office.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Please explain to me why you don't
          have an ear-to-ear smile right now.

                         THEY ENTER--

          INT. DAVID'S OFFICE -- DAY

          David hesitates. It's like his friend is an alien.. .but then
          again he's totally normal.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 37.

                         DAVID
          I lost her number.

                         CHARLIE
          You lost her number?

                         DAVID
          (searching for something)
          I was pickpocketed.

                         CHARLIE
          Come on. You can't be serious.
          (off David's look)
          You're serious... Oh, man...dude.
          I'm sorry... I'm really sorry...

           EXT. PIER -- ADJACENT TO WEST SIDE HIGHWAY -- DAY

           David sits on a bench looking at the water. The wind picks
           up and he puts his hands in his,coatpockets to keep them
           warm. His right hand feels something. He pulls out a
          ticket for the 4 pm Circle..Line tourist boat cruise.
          EXT. CIRCLE LINE CRUtgE -- DAY
          The boat pulls away front=the dock. It's misting rain so
          there's only asmattering of tourists on-board. David stands
          looking back at Manhattan. Harry is next to him.

                         HARRY
          A lot of people just collapse when
          they see what you've s'een. Their
          personal choices suddenly seem
          meaningless to them. Life starts
          to feel pointless.

                         DAVID
          I was` raised to believe there's
          something behind the curtain. I
          just never pictured it quite like
          this.

                         HARRY
          Most people don't.
          Harry looks over his shoulder, scans for any signs of his
          colleagues. He's far from relaxed.

                         HARRY
          How are you feeling?

                         DAVID
          You should know. You can read my
          mind, right?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 38.
          Harry hesitates...as if he's not sure how much to tell David,
          how far to go with this. Finally:

                         HARRY
          Richardson was just trying to scare
          you.

                         DAVID
          He knew what color I was thinking.

                         HARRY
          Because he set it up as a choice.
          "Choose a color. Choose a number"

                         DAVID
          So?
          Harry looks away. He's crossing a line. He's really putting
          himself out there:

                         HARRY
          We can't read your mind or hear
          your thoughts. But before you make
          a choice your brain weighs options,
          and we percpite that. We know if
          you're going to go off Plan "or not
          because, as long as we're close
          enough, we cansense it when it's
          about to happen.

                         DAVID
          it-;' s like a sixth sense for you?

                         HARRY
          Seventh, actually.

                         DAVID
          What did they do too Charlie?

                         HARRY
          Made some small change in the way
          he assesses risk.

                         DAVID
          What type of risk?

                         HARRY
          (this is beside the point)
          I don't know. Something arcane.
          Something to do with mortgage-
          backed securities.

                         DAVID
          That's all?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         2/12/09 39

                         HARRY
          Yes.

                         DAVID
          What would your colleagues do to
          you if they knew what you were
          telling me?
          This is precisely what Harry has been worried about.

                         HARRY
          That's why we're meeting out here.

                         DAVID
          They're not following me?

                         HARRY
          We don't have the manpower to
          follow everybody all the time.
          They're checking in on you. Just
          not here. Not right now.
          ON David's face considering this.

          EXT. UPPER DECK DAY

          Moments later. They stand out of earshot of the few
          tourists up here.

                         DAVID
          Why are you helping me?

                         HARRY
          I have my reasons.
          David studies him. Ha=rry's' clearly not ready to go into

                         THEM:

                         DAVID
          Why do they care if I'm with Elise?

                         HARRY
          Your entire reality gets shattered
          this morning and you want to know
          about a woman?

                         DAVID
          Why do they care?
          Harry looks back at him. Taken aback a bit by how much David
          seems to care.

                         HARRY
          I don't know.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 40.

                         DAVID
          You have no idea?

                         HARRY
          All I know is, given the amount of
          resources they've used, keeping you
          from her is pretty important to
          them.
          (off David's silence)
          You're going to look for her aren't
          you?
          Again, David is silent.

                          HARRY (CONT'D)
          There are twelve million people in
          this city. On a slow day. You're
          not going to find her, you do
          realize that, don't yore-?

                         (BEAT)
          Even if a hypnotist pulled her
          number out of the recesses of your
          brain, no matter how many times you
          called it, you,'d never get
          through...

                         DAVID
          (his face hardening)
          They send you here to tell me that?

                         HARRY (CONT'D)
          You want my advice? Forget about
          her. Accept that you'`>ll never see
          her again. Move on with your life.
          ON David as Harry's words sink in.

                         FADE TO:

          EXT. MADISON SQUARE PARK -- MORNING

          Huge shafts of morning sunlight cut across the park outside
          David's apartment. The trees are blooming. It's Spring now.

          INT. BEDROOM -- MORNING

          An alarm clock reads 6:29 am. David lies alone in bed. He's
           already awake, staring at the ceiling...
           After a long beat the alarm clock rings. David shuts it
          off. But then just lies there...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 41.

           INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

           It's the same apartment -- except it's bigger now. Instead
           of two large windows on the park, his apartment is now six
          windows across. (He has bought the two one-bedrooms next to
           his and knocked the walls down). Three years have passed.
           No files on the table, like there were the last time we were
          here. David is on the phone in a new park-view study.

           CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)
          How are you feeling about the
          speech?
          David has not noticeably aged and yet he's more tempered and
          subdued than when we last saw him. We `hear it in his voice:

                         DAVID
          I'm ready... I changed a few
          things last night.

          CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)
          Tell me at breakfast.

          THROUGH THE WINDOW AT DAVID
          David finishes his call, then looks out the window. There is
          a detachment in h-s eyes that didn't exist before. After a
          moment, he gets his=coat and heads for the door.

          EXT. MADISON SQUARE PARK -- MORNING

          David exits Starbucks with a coffee. He walks across the
          park toward the same Fifth Avenue bus stop he did three years
          ado.` Even his posture and,-gait are different.

          INT. BUS -- MORNING

          David enters the Ml bus. He feeds his Metrocard into the
          reader as he looks down the aisle scanning the riders.. .more
          out of habit than actual hope. He walks back to take a seat.

          INT. BUS -- MINUTES LATER -- MORNING

          David stares idly out the window. His Blackberry buzzes with
          a text message. Looks down at it. Then looks back out the
          window. Suddenly his eyes snap into focus.
          DAVID'S POV: The bus passes a woman walking on the sidewalk.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 42.
          David's head whips around, only able to see her from the back
          now. She walks like Elise. She's dressed in the same
          eclectic style. He slams the red "next stop" strip, jumps
          to his feet, and runs to the front of the bus.

                         DAVID
          Stop the bus.

                         DRIVER
          The next stop--

                         DAVID
          Now.

          EXT. EAST VILLAGE -- MORNING

          The bus stops. David jumps out on Broadway. FOLLOW him as
          he takes off across the street and runs down 12th. He
          catches up to her at University Place.

                         DAVID
          Elise!
          The woman turns around.
          And it's her...

                         ELISE
          David?

                         DAVID
          Hi.

                         ELISE
          Wow... How areyou.
          Reeling from the adrenaline; David takes a moment, then:

                         DAVID
          (from the heart)
          I rode the Ml to work every day for
          the last three years hoping one day
          I'd run into you again.
          She's amused, rather than moved, because she doesn't buy it.

                         ELISE
          Calling would have been easier.

                         DAVID
          I couldn't.

                         ELISE
          Girlfriend wouldn't let you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 43.

                         DAVID
          No girlfriend.
          She looks at him with continued skepticism. But his
          expression is dead serious.

                         DAVID (CONT'D)
          Can we go somewhere and talk?
          She hesitates. It hurt when he didn't call. She's angry at
          herself for that, but it's the truth.

                         ELISE
          (re: his suit)
          Don't you have to get to work?

                         DAVID
          I just got sick.

                         ELISE
          "I haven't seen you in three years -
          - You make me sick" is not an
          ideal come-on. For the record.
          David smiles. She's softening. A little. His phone
          vibrates. He pulls it out of his pocket.

                         DAVID
          One second.

                         (PICKING UP)
          CharlieT can't make breakfast.

          CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)
          Why not?

                         DAVID
          And...I might have to push the
          speech.

          CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)
          What? Are you crazy?!

                         DAVID
          I just ran into Elise.
          He hangs up.

                         ELISE
          You just hung up on your best
          friend.

                         DAVID
          We've known each other since we
          were kids. We have a shorthand.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 44.
          He's not being flip or clever or smooth. He's being matter-
          of-fact. Serious.

                         ELISE
          What speech?

                         DAVID
          Doesn't matter. Let's take a walk.
          His focus on her is absolute. But she's wary of getting
          reeled in again.

                         ELISE
          Where?

                         DAVID
          Somewhere far. We have a lot to
          talk about.

                         ELISE
          I don't think you should cancel
          your speech. What if I don't like
          you at the end of our walk?

                         DAVID
          I'll take my chances.

                         ELISE
          Seri6us1y, my number hasn't
          changed:. Just call me like you
          didn't last time.

                         DAVID
          My-speech will always be there, you
          might not be.

                         ELISE

                         (AMUSED/INDIGNANT)
          I was there, David. You didn't
          callrie!

                         DAVID

          It's been years, David. How do
          you know I don't have a boyfriend?
          Oh, shit. He hasn't even had time to think about that.

          So all the stuff about me being in
          your mind constantly for the last
          three years was just talk... The
          truth is you don't have any real
          conviction.

                         DAVID
          It wouldn't matter.

                         ELISE

          for never calling me.

          I didn't have your number.

          What?

                         DAVID
          It was taken from me. I was
          mugged.

          possibly-explain my fawning all
          over you on that bus three years
          ago...and again today and not
          calling you in between?

          Um, you had a girlfriend and you
          felt guilty. I have a thing about
          being lied to, David.

                         DAVID
          I swear to God I didn't have your
          number. I swear on my parents'

          I didn't even have a last name to
          try to track you down. Do you know
          how many pages come back when you
          type "Elise" into Google?

                         (BEAT)
          And none of them were you.

          You really are smooth.

                         DAVID
          That's not fair.

                         ELISE
          It's okay. I like it. I probably
          shouldn't, but I do.

          Ballet is basically impossible to
          do correctly.

          Why?

                         ELISE
          You just do absurd things. with your
          body. The movement is completely
          unnatural. It requires incredible
          strength in all sorts of random
          muscles. And you have to be born
          with ridiculous amounts of
          flexibility in your hip or you'll
          never be an y good.

          A kiss, that's all it takes?

                         MCCRADY
          A real kiss. But once they do that
          every possible adjustment that's
          strong enough to break them up will
          cause ripples over your limit.

                         THAT'S WHY--

                         ELISE
          God, don't skip this for me.

                         DAVID
          I told you I'm not letting you out
          of my sight.

                         CHARLIE
          David, what the hell?

                         DAVID
          (to Elise, realizing a way
          out of his dilemma)
          Come with me. Come and watch.

                         ELISE

                         (SMILING)
          Okay.
          Her phone buzzes with a text message.

                         CHARLIE
          (to both of them)
          Great. Perfect solution. Now,
          let's pay and get you over there.
          Charlie waves the waiter over to give them the check.

                         ELISE
          Now?

                         CHARLIE
          The speech is in 30 minutes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 54.

                         ELISE
          I can't then.
          (indicating text message)
          They just moved my dress rehearsal
          to noon.
          David's own sixth sense kicks in. Has he been discovered?

                         DAVID
          We can reschedule the speech.

                         ELISE
          David!

                         CHARLIE

                         (TO ELISE)
          Thank you.
          David looks around for anything out of the ordinary, any sign
          of Richardson or his men. But. they stay out of view. He
          thinks they're not on to him yet.

                         ELISE
          I'll meet you right after the
          rehearsal.

                         DAVID
          Where does your company perform?

                         ELISE
          We're n in our space. There was
          a`;â€¢power ot outage or something.
           (checking the text)

          West Broadway today.

                         CHARLIE

                         (REALIZING)
          That's four blocks from where
          you're speaking.
          David reacts: Richardson can't be behind that.

                         CHARLIE
          You can literally walk there after
          the speech.
          David nods, his suspicions fading.

                         CHARLIE

                         (CHECKING WATCH)
          But we've got to leave right now.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 55.

          EXT. BOATHOUSE PATIO -- DAY

          Richardson and his team watch as David, convinced now he's
          still undiscovered, stands up and heads to the door with
          Charlie and Elise.

                         MCCRADY
          The "four blocks" thing was a
          brilliant move, boss.

                         RICHARDSON
          (putting his hat on)
          We're not out of the woods yet.
          He looks down at the inflection points in McCrady's Planbook.

          INT. BAR AREA -- DAY

          David and Charlie and Elise walk:toward the side. entrance.

                         ELISE

                         (POINTING WEST:)
          I've got to go that way...to stop
          by my apartment and change.

                         DAVID
          Okay.
          David and Elise stop to say goodbye to-each other.

                         ELISE
          You know, the speech on election
          night, you said I inspired you...
          I wish I could do that again now.

          EST.BOATHOUSE PATIO DAY
           Richardson makes a small hand motion in Charlie's direction.

          INT. BAR AREA -- DAY

          Charlie's iphone buzzes. It's an alarm reminder. A text
          appears: "15 minute sound check." He's a few feet from--

          DAVID AND ELISE
          David leans toward Elise--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 56.

                         CHARLIE

                         (INTERRUPTING)
          David, the speech starts in 15
          minutes. We have a 25 minute
          drive.

          EXT. BOATHOUSE PATIO -- DAY

          Richardson makes a gesture at the TV by the bar. The picture
          changes (though we can't see to what).
          He then moves a water glass on'their table. The sun hits the
          glass and reflects into the bar area where--

          INT. BAR AREA -- DAY

          --the reflection catches the eye of a 40 year-old woman
          having a coffee at the bar with, her 65 year-old mother.
          Turning so the sun is out of,=hereyes causes the daughter to
          notice the TV: an image of David's famous concession speech
          from three years ago. A screen graphic reads "Announcing
          Today?"
          As the daughter turns back to look at her mother, she notices
          David, over her mom's shoulder...

          DAVID AND ELISE
          David squeezes her hand... and leans in again--

                         DAVID
          just want to

          VOICE. (0. S . )
          I hope the rumors are true,
          Congressman.
          David pulls back fr`bm Elise, suddenly self-conscious, turns
          to see the 40-year old woman Richardson just manipulated.
          She points at the TV report on David's announcement.

                         40 YEAR-OLD WOMAN
          You have my vote.

                         65 YEAR-OLD WOMAN
          Mine too... and I usually disagree
          with her.

                         DAVID
          Thanks. Thanks a lot.
          David turns back to Elise.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 57.

                         ELISE

                         (NEEDLING)
          Well, you're really just a hit with
          women of all ages, aren't you?

          CHARLIE -- A FEW FEET AWAY
          On the phone.

                         CHARLIE
          I'm wrangling him right now--

          DAVID AND ELISE

                         DAVID
          Whatever happens...I'm not going to
          let anything stand between us this
          time.
          It's such an odd thing to say, if you don't know what David
          has gone through. She gives him a quizzical look. But
          she's also moved by his,tone

                         ELISE
          Okay.:.. I believe you. Of course
          I tend to believe in the wrong
          people. Especially men.
          It's the kind of quip that's more truth than jest.

                         DAVID
          Not this time.
          He leans in to kiss her--

          EXT. BOATHOUSE PATIO -- DAY

          A horrified look from Richardson--

          INT. BAR AREA -- DAY

          David kisses Elise on the cheek. But he lingers...
          Then pulls. away without going further...

                         DAVID
          I'll see you in two hours.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 58.

          EXT. BOATHOUSE PATIO -- DAY

          Richardson and his colleagues all breathe a large sigh of
          relief.. .as they watch David leave.

                         MCCRADY
          We're okay...

                         RICHARDSON
          That was way too close. What the
          hell is going on with this case?

          INT. TOWN CAR -- DAY

          David and Charlie ride in the back. Charlie looks at David.

                         DAVID
          What?

                         CHARLIE
          I've just never seen you like that.
          David can't possibly explain.

                         CHARLIE
          "I'm going to-postpone my
          announcement to have brunch with a
          woman?" Postpone any speech. I
          know she made an impression on you
          but this is ...
          Charlie just shakes his head, unable to comprehend. A beat.

                         CHARLIE
          "What is it about her?

                         DAVID

                         (BEAT)
          I don't know...

          EXT. RSR FINANCIAL BUILDING -- DAY

          David pulls up outside. Hundreds of his supporters and the
          press are waiting for him. He gets out of the car to cheers.

          INT. BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET FROM RSR FINANCIAL -- DAY

          Richardson stands with McCrady on the upper level of a two-
          story lobby looking out at David arriving for his speech.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 59.

          INT. ELISE'S APARTMENT -- DAY

          Elise changes into her dance gear. Big smile on her face.
          She spots something on her bookshelf (we can't see what) and
          her smile fades. She takes it and puts it in a drawer.
          Her phone vibrates. She has a text message: "Power back on
          at MMB. Rehearsal at noon."

          INT. BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET FROM RSR FINANCIAL -- DAY

          McCrady hangs up a silver cell phone and nods at Richardson:
          "it's done." Just then Richardson's phone buzzes. The
          caller ID says: "Mr. Donaldson."

                         RICHARDSON
          Richardson. Yes, sir. Believe me,
          it was a surprise to me too. But
          I think we have it under control.

          INT. DANCE STUDIO -- DAY

          Elise and her friend, LAUREN, 20s, stretch between routines.
          An unexpected smile spreads across Elise's face.

                         LAUREN
          Oh, you're clone. You're gone...

          MINUTES LATER -- DAY
          A half-dozen news organizations, film the speech.

                         DAVID
          .I'm here today to honor that,
          and to announce my intention to run
          for the United States Senate...

          INT. DANCE STUDIO -- DAY


                         LAUREN
          Just tell me if he disappears one
          more time you'll never take his
          call again.

                         ELISE
          Don't worry. That's definite.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 60.

          EXT. RSR FINANCIAL BUILDING -- DAY

          The audience applauds energetically. David nods "thank you"
          and steps away from the lectern they set up. He shakes two
          or three people's hands but then heads inside the building.

          INT. LOBBY OF RSR FINANCIAL -- DAY

          David huddles inside with Charlie. Reporters outside are in
          front of their cameras filing their stories amidst the
          lingering crowd.

                         CHARLIE
          Good Morning America at 7am
          tomorrow, then you have the bankers
          group... David, are you listening?
          David's staring out the window. The sunlight has caught the
          building across the street just right to illuminate
          Richardson and McCrady on the second floor.

          INT. BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET -- DAY


           RICHARDSON (INTO PHONE)
          I ' 11-keep you = posted, sir.
           Richardson hangs up the phone and turns .t look out at David.
          As he does he real zes David can see him.

                         RICHARDSON
          D` emit !
          Richardson-steps back out of the sunlight.

          MCC- .DY
          What?

                         RICHARDSON
          Get out of the sunlight.
          McCrady, notices David looking, jumps back out of the light.

                         RICHARDSON

                         (FUMING)
          I cannot get a break on this case.

          INT. LOBBY OF RSR FINANCIAL -- DAY

          Charlie is trying to understand what David's staring at.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 61.

                         DAVID
          I have to see Elise now.

                         CHARLIE
          After you go back out there and
          talk to the New York channels--

                         DAVID
          Tomorrow. After GMA.
          He heads for the door. Charlie follows.

                         CHARLIE
          No, we need this on the nightly--
          (catching up to David and

                         STOPPING HIM)
          David...
          Charlie looks at him for a moment, searching for the right
          words to say to a friend...

                         CHARLIE
          Every time we get close.. .you do
          something to derail it.
          A beat. There's a truth to that. David knows it. But--

                         DAVID
          This is different. Trust me, it's
          different.
          David leaves.

          EXT.. WESTBROADWAY AND MURRAY ST -- DAY

          David looks at thepiece of..paper. An.address on West
          Broadway for "Nyman Studios " He's standing at the locked
          front door. No one inside. Richardson is on to him.
          The surprise on his face turns to anger.. .then resolve.
          He dials Elise's number on his cell. Gets voicemail.

                         DAVID
          Elise ...I doubt you'll ever get
          this message but--

                         JUMP CUT
          David dials 411.

                         DAVID

          2/12/09 62.
          He looks down to see his phone has zero bars...

          INT. FURNITURE STORE -- DAY

          David goes to the saleswoman.

          EXT. FURNITURE STORE -- DAY

          Through the window we see he saleswoman dial a number ... then
          look at the phone and shrug. It's dead. She and David go
          to her computer. She looks at it, puzzled. It's dead too.
          PULL BACK to REVEAL Richardson and McCrady.

                         MCCRADY
          He's going to go next door:.
          Just then David exits the furniture store and goes next door
          to a clothing store--

                         MCCRADY

          David gets to the phone book page that ends with "Manhattan
          Mobile Phone Company." The next page is torn out. David
          slams his fist down.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 63.

          EXT. REAL ESTATE OFFICE -- DAY

          David exits the office to find Richardson on the sidewalk.
          With McCrady nearby.

                         RICHARDSON
          There is an entire world of women
          out there. I thought I made it
          clear this one was off limits.
          David takes off walking.

                         DAVID
          I must have forgotten. It's been a
          while.

                         RICHARDSON
          Doesn't change the fact.
          David looks around, trying to figure out his next move.

                         DAVID
          Why are you so.determined to keep
          us apart?

                         RICHARDSON
          You know: why.

                         DAVID
          The Plan? If there is a Pi ri you
          misread it.

                         RICHARDSON
          There's no misreading what the Plan
          says about you and Elise. It's
          unequivocal.

                         DAVID
          Then your Plan's wrong.

                         RICHARDSON
          Do you realize who wrote this Plan?

                         DAVID
          I don't care.
          Richardson grabs him and pushes him against a brick wall.

                         RICHARDSON
          Well you should. You need to learn
          a little more respect.
          David shoves him off. Looks like he might take a swing at
          Richardson. Then his eye catches the complex diagram that
          McCrady is looking at in his Planbook.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 64.

                         DAVID
          Why are you keeping us apart?

                         RICHARDSON
          Because the Plan calls for it.

                         BECAUSE--

                         DAVID

                         (FLARING)
          You put us together three times--

                         RICHARDSON
          That was chance. That wasn't us.

                         DAVID
          Three times? Bullshit! If I'm not
          supposed to be with her then why do
          I feel like this?

                         RICHARDSON
          It doesn't matter what you feel.
          It matters what's in black and
          white.
          David's ready to explode: at him when he sees something in
          Richardson's eyes. David stops.. .then his whole expression
          changes...

                         DAVID
          You don't know, do you? You don't
          know why they're keeping us
          apart...

                         RICHARDSON

                         (COVERING)
          'It's not something your mind could
          :comprehend.

                         DAVID
          You're in a nice suit but the
          reality is you're just a minion
          aren't you?
          David pushes past Richardson and walks into a busy
          restaurant. McCrady quickly consults his Planbook.

                         MCCRADY
          He's deciding how to--

                         (REALIZING)
          Uh..oh--

          INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT -- DAY

          David strides in and goes right to a chair. Stands on it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 65.

                         DAVID

                         (LOUD)
          Excuse me ladies and gentleman--
          (as people turn and look,

                         RECOGNIZE HIM)
          I'm sorry to disturb your lunch. I
          have a bit of an emergency. Is
          there anybody in this room who's
          ever seen a performance of the
          Manhattan Modern Ballet?

          EXT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT -- DAY

          From outside, Richardson and McCrady watch.

                         RICHARDSON
          Son of a bitch.

                         MCCRADY
          He's smart. He's very smart.
          David exits the restaurant from another door. He hurries
          toward West Broadway.

          EXT. WEST BROADWAY -- DAY

          Not a taxi in sight. David looks for one in vain. Suddenly
          Richardson emerges from a storefront and, goes to David.

                         RICHARDSON
          Maybe you should try the subway.
          David holds him in a steely gaze.

                         DAVID'
          Don't all those cab drivers you're
          diverting have Plans too? What
          about all the other people looking
          for cabs in this part of the city
          right n6t? What about their Plans?
          The ripples must be endless...
          Richardson is taken aback that David has figuredthis out.

                         DAVID
          I don't care what you put in my
          way, I'm not going to give up.
          David walks off, leaving Richardson standing there.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 66.

          MINUTES LATER -- DAY
          Richardson and McCrady watch David looking for a taxi at a
          very busy intersection.

                         MCCRADY
          You've got two more minutes keeping
          taxis off West Broadway before--

                         RICHARDSON

                         (FRUSTRATED)
          I need something that's going to
          keep him in place longer--

          EXT. LEONARD ST -- DAY

          On foot, David heads West towards Hudson St. Several taxis
          pass with their roof lights off;. Suddenly, down the street,
          he sees one with his roof light on. He runs for. it when--
          CRASH -- twenty feet in front of him two cars collide. Metal
          crunches and glass breaks. This is no fender bender--

                         DAVID
          Jesus:.,
          (looks for Richardson)
          Is this how far you people will
          go?!
          He rushes toward the accident--

          EXT. SITE OF ACCIDENT -- DAY


                         ARE
          An hour later. Four police cars and an ambulance. They

          Unfortunately you're the only
          witness, Congressman.

                         DAVID
          How much longer?

                         POLICE OFFICER
          A few more minutes. I'm sorry. I
          know you have to meet somebody.

                         DAVID
          I didn't say I had to meet anyone.

                         POLICE OFFICER
          Well ...I just assumed--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 67.

          EXT. ROOFTOP -- DAY

          Richardson is watching David get interviewed--

                         RICHARDSON
          Amateur! That's an amateur's
          mistake!

          BACK TO SCENE -- EXT. SITE OF ACCIDENT -- DAY


                         DAVID
          You're not a real cop, are you?
          You're one of them. Somebody could
          have been killed in that crash!
          Doesn't that make you--

                         "POLICE OFFICER"
          Sir, calm down.
          But David's already walking away.

                         DAVID
          Sergeant!
          He goes to the highest ranking guy on the. scene.

                         DAVID
          I know you heed a statement from
          me, but do I have to stay here to
          give it to you or--

                         SERGEANT
          No, sir, we know ow to get in
          touch with you.

          DAVS,D
          Thank you. '.Is this man under your
          command?
          David turns to see that the "Police Officer" who was
          interviewing him is gone.

          EXT. HUDSON ST -- DAY

          David gets into a taxi.

          17th Street between 10th and 11th.
          And sir, you might have to break
          some traffic laws getting there.
          So take this.
          He hands him a $100 bill. A light that just turned green

                         GOES YELLOW--

                         DAVID
          Go through that--
          The driver blows through it as it turns re

          ACROSS THE STREET
          Richardson and McCrady are in front of a hip cafe arguing.

                         RICHARDSON
          I want more red liUhtss--

                         MCCRADY
          (,consulting Planbook)
          There are too many, ripples in the
          system.. Cumm.lative effects are.
          coming into play.

                         RICHARDSON
          A traffic jam.

                         MCC
          That's even w r. We have to get
          more localize.
          Richardson looks at the taxi disappearing up Hudson.

                         RICHARDSON
          He's getting out of range!

          INT. HIP CAFE HALLWAY / KITCHEN -- DAY

          Richardson and McCrady rush through the cafe and into the
          KITCHEN, surprising the CHEF so completely that he can't even
          manage a word before they throw open the insulated door to
          the COLD PANTRY and run inside.

                         CHEF
          Hey!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 69.
          The chef charges over and pulls open the door to find --
          refrigerated food. And nothing else. Richardson and McCrady
          have disappeared. The chef blinks.

          INT. ART GALLERY -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS ACTION

          Richardson and McCrady rush from a storage room to the
          showroom of a fancy art gallery. Patrons stare as they rush
          straight out the front door and onto Gansevoort Street.

          EXT. 8TH AVENUE -- DAY

          David's taxi is hitting all the lights iiow.

          EXT. GANSEVOORT ST -- DAY

          Richardson and McCrady move swiftly down the block.
          Richardson heads up the stairs of a brownstone. Opens the
          door to see a street in Chinatown. He slams the door shut.

          RI.CEARDSON
          Wrong one.
          (thinks)..
          Two doors down. God, I hate

          They can see a taxi, pulling up in front of the Manhattan
          Modern Ballet buildig down the block. They run towards it.

                         MCCRADY

                         (RE: PLANBOOK)
          I've got inflection points. All
          they have to do is catch sight of
          each other this time--

                         RICHARDSON
          What?

          LAUREN, is nearby as David speaks to the receptionist. MUSIC
          comes from a door across the room.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          Is she expecting you?
          He nods.

          are. I'm the friend. Lauren.

          Can 'I block the front door?

                         NCCRADY

          Lauren walks David toward the door with the music behind it.

                         LAUREN
          It goes without saying that I'll
          kill you if you hurt her.

          There are several next ones--

          I'm blocking them all--
          His hand stretches out (as Harry did early on in film)

                         MCCRADY
          Wait, he's--

          INT. LOBBY / DANCE STUDIO -- DAY

          MUSIC pours out as David opens the door. A quarter of the
          way open, the door stops dead.

          EXT. DANCE STUDIO -- DAY

          Richardson grabs the front door and pulls. It's sealed shut.
          It won't budge.

                         WHAT THE-

          Hat! Hat!
          McCrady is behind him He points. at Richardson's fedora,
          which is on the sidewalk. Fell off when he ran. Richardson
          sprints to grab it--

          David looks through the narrow space of the open door and
          sees Elise dancing. The piece she's practicing fuses the
          gra e -ballet with the raw emotion of modern. She's ï¿½xl
          eattaking.

          I'm in serious trouble here...

                         (CONSULTING FOLIO)
          Forget it! He's already there...
          Richardson charges into the lobby to see David staring
          through the partially open door to the rehearsal room...

                         RICHARDSON
          Dammit !
          McCrady's phone buzzes. He pulls it out and looks at the
          caller ID.

                         MCCRADY

                         (DREAD)
          It's Mr. Donaldson.
          Richardson pulls the fedora off his head and crushes it in
          his hands.
          David turns just in time to see this. At the same time
          David realizes the door is no longer "stuck."

                         RICHARDSON
          Celebrate while you can. They'll
          just kick it upstairs now You
          have no idea what you're up
          against.
          David just looks at him. He'll deal with that when it
          comes...

                         MCCRADY
          Sir?
          Richardson grabs the phone and answers --.going outside to
          talk.
          David turns back to the dance studio. He opens the door to
          get an unobstructed view of Elisee,. She spins, arches, dips.
          David can't take his eyes off hey`
          When the artistic director pauses the routine to give notes,
          Elise gives David a. little wave. Then they start again.
          David looks back out at Richardson on the street, but he's
          gone..

          TNT. ADJUSTMENT BUREAU HEADQUARTERS -- DUSK
          A defeated Richardson trudges up a long flight of stairs.

          INT. HALLWAY -- DUSK

          Richardson walks down a hallway with an impossibly shiny
          black floor and enters a doorway marked "Mr. Donaldson."

          INT. MR. DONALDSON'S OUTER OFFICE -- DUSK

          Two secretaries look up at him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 73.

                         SECRETARY #1
          He's waiting for you.

          INT. MR. DONALDSON'S OFFICE -- DUSK

          Much larger than Richardson's office and on a higher floor.
          MR. DONALDSON, 45, sits at his desk reading a document.
          After a moment he signs it at the bottom and looks up,
          REVEALING Richardson, who is standing awkwardly in front of
          his superior's desk.
          Donaldson motions for him to sit down.

          INT. DANCE STUDIO -- DUSK

          now.
          David talks to Elise, who's showered and dressed

                         DAVID
          You're incredible. How did you get
          that good?

                         ELISE
          It's all I do. It's the only thing
          I ever wante& to be. And I started
          young.

                         AVID
          How young?

                         ELISE
          By third grade I was going every
          day after school.

                         DAVID
          That's a lot of motivation for an
          eight year-old.
          She waves to the other dancers and receptionist in the lobby
          and they exit on to--

          EXT. 17TH ST -- DUSK -- CONTINUOUS


                         ELISE
          We moved around a lot then. Dance
          was kind of my stability.

                         DAVID
          Sure... it was the only constant in
          your life, aside from your
          parents...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 74.

                         ELISE
          Really more the dance.
          She doesn't make a big deal of it but we get it.

                         DAVID
          Oh...
          David's phone buzzes. Caller ID shows it's Charlie.

                         ELISE
          I take it this is an unauthorized
          social break.

                         DAVID
          I'm a candidate for the US-:Serrate.
          I don't have to punch out''when I
          leave.
          David sends the call to voice.mai

                         ELISE
          Charlie?

                         DAVID
          Couple houtrs while I'm out of touch
          won't:ill him.

                         ELISE
          Couple hour, huh? Well, we better
          make them,,-,--'count.

          EXT. EAST VILLAGE -- DUSK

          A taxi pulls tpÂ°a stop.- bavid 'leans over Elise to look out
          thew n4ow as he waits fot change from the driver.
          What's this-Pï¿½-

                         ELISE
          What's it look like?
          We see the reflection of a dance club in the window.

                         DAVID
          I'm a terrible dancer. I don't
          dance.
          Elise climbs out. David follows.

                         ELISE
          You don't now. By the end of the
          night, you will.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 75.
          They walk towards "Plan B", a hip joint with zebra wallpaper
          and fake palm trees. Salsa music pulses from inside.

                         DAVID
          You're going to teach me to dance
          in one night? Not happening.

                         ELISE
          Are you doubting me?

                         DAVID
          Yes.
          She spins and shoves him against the wall. Forcefully kisses
          him. Then pulls free.

                         ELISE
          Don't.
          She turns and walks into the club. David stands there.

                         DAVID
          Holy shit...

          INT. DONALDSON'S OFFICE -- DUSK

          Richardson sits across from Donaldson.

                         DONALDSON
          The disciplinary rules requ-te me
          to. demote you in rank and re-assign
          yot to a less desirable post.
          Donaldson Â±ingers the document he just signed.

                         DONALDSON
          I'm going-'to interpret those rules
          loosely. I'm going to go easy on
          you because,I feel the deck was
          stacked ,against you.
          In a WIDER shot we see that both Burdensky and Donaldson's
          AIDE sit nearby.

                         DONALDSON
          I'm talking about the intense
          chemistry between them, the
          constant inflection points, and the
          kicker of course: you pulling them
          apart only to have "chance" put
          them back together. Twice. That
          seemed impossible. So I asked
          Burdensky to do some research this
          morning, which he just completed.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 76.

                         BURDENSKY
          It seems like these two were meant
          to be together because they were
          meant to be together...

                         RICHARDSON
          What?!

                         BURDENSKY
          Were, in the past, in an earlier
          version of the plan. Actually a
          dozen earlier versions.

                         (BEAT)
          God knows how many artifacts
          pushing them together are left in
          the current plan.

          INT. PLAN B -- DUSK

          A live salsa band has just started. Elise demonstrates Mambo
          for David. Couldn't be farther from the style of dance he
          just saw her rehearse. But she's amazing at it.

                         DAVID
          Serious, serious.trouble...

                         MOMENTS LATER
          Salt, Patron, lime .'-.and two glasses dotin on the bar.

                         ELISE
          Ready?
          Nope.

                         ELISE
          Perfect.
          She yanks him onto the dance floor.

          INT. DONALDSON'S OFFICE -- DUSK

          Donaldson, Richardson, Burdensky.

                         RICHARDSON
          Why was it changed?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 77.

                         DONALDSON
          Something important. They went
          from "meant to be together" to "red-
          letter denied relationship" in a
          single Plan revision a few years
          back. As for why, specifically,
          that's apparently above even my pay
          grade...

          INT. PLAN B -- NIGHT

          David and Elise dance. He sucks, but doesn't care. A couple
          of people in the club recognize him and give him thumbs up...

          INT. ADJUSTMENT BUREAU HEADQUARTERS --'NIGHT

          Burdensky and a dejected Richardson walk down the hall.

                         RICHARDSON
          You spend your whole career hoping
          that one day you'll get a "red-
          letter" case. Something you can
          really make a name for yourself
          with. Finally I get one... and
          it's. .booby-trapped...

          CLOSE ON THE BAR'
          Another set of shot glasses hit the bar. UP to REVEAL David
          and Elise..

                         ELISE
          Okay, we've al-ready used up an
          hour, we >etter hurry.
          She pills him toward the exit.

                         DAVID
          Hurry where?

          INT. MUSTANG CLUB -- NIGHT

          Elise does a sexy, street variation on a two-step to an up-
          tempo pop-country ballad. David tries to follow along,
          mostly by bobbing his head with the beat. Sort of with the
          beat.

                         ELISE
          You've got to let yourself feel the
          music.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 78.

                         DAVID
          I've been told I have trouble
          feeling.

                         ELISE
          Whoever said that hasn't seen you
          speak.

                         DAVID
          That's different. I mean--

                         ELISE
          What?

                         DAVID
          In private. With women AlthOugh
          that might be changing. Is there
          any style of dance you can:'t do?

          EXT. HUNTER'S POINT, QUEENS -- NIGHT

          David and Elise walk from the waterfront to the street.

                         ELISE
          Next stop, the best 80s club in the
          city. You ready?

                         DAVID
          To make an ass of myself for the
          third time in one night? Â§4`r, 6'.

                         ELISE

                         (POINTS)
          Race me to that light. You lose,
          you dance, I watch. You win, I
          dance, you watch

                         DAVID'
          What are'the rules of the race---

                         ELISE
          No rules.

                         DAVID
          Hmmm, could get ugly...
          He looks down an alley as if he's noticed something. When
          she looks, he takes off like a bat out of hell--

                         ELISE
          You bastard!
          He's got a good lead, so he flips around and runs backwards.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 79.

                         DAVID
          Quit complaining and run.
          She catches up. He spins and digs it out. He can't dance,
          but he sure can run. He pulls away and wins.

                         DAVID
          Yes!!!!
          He pumps his arms in a victory dance.

                         ELISE

                         (PISSED SMILE)
          That was good. That was very good.

                         DAVID
          You said "no rules".
          She punches him in the stomach. Hard. He crumples,
          completely unprepared for it.

                         DAVID

                         (IT HURTS)
          Sweet Jesus! Christ on a crutch!

                         ELISE

                         (GIGGLING)
          You said you had trouble feeling.

                         DAVID
          You're insane.

                         ELISE
          We. need a cab.
          He'laughing through the'pain.

                         DAVID
          I'm serious. You're a maniac. You
          should come with a warning label.

                         ELISE
          I do. You just can't see it with
          my clothes on.
          OFF David biting his lip... and PRE-LAPPING the music--

          INT/EXT. A WAREHOUSE CLUB, RED HOOK DOCKS, BROOKLYN -- NIGHT

          David and Elise walk into the synthesizer prelude to "I Can't
          Wait" by Nu Shooz.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 80.

                         DAVID
          Doesn't this song make you feel
          like you're at your high school
          prom?

                         ELISE
          I was six when it came out. So,
          not really.
          Brutal. David just shakes his head and smiles as, she pulls
          him to the dance floor.

                         MUSIC
          Baby...1-I-I can't wait--

                         STROBE LIGHTS
          As the song kicks in and David and Elise start dancing... A
          couple of kids next to them notice David and start pointing
          and signaling their approval-
          The kids who first spotted David have alerted a few others.
          More people in the crowd cheer him on.

          INT. DONALDSON'S_OFFICE -- NIGHT

          Donaldson stares pensively out the , window,: looking down over
          the city.

          "The Hammer?" Yes. He'll crush
          this romance with the flick of his

          I've been waiting for--
          People on the dance floor are literally screaming in support.

          EXT. RED HOOK -- NIGHT;

          David and Elise stand on the pier outside the dance club.

                         ELISE
          You grew up over there?
          She indicatesa residential area just behind the docks.

                         DAVID

                         (POINTING)
          I spent any, entire childhood three
          blocks up Carroll Street. We
          didn'.t move-` around a lot.

                         ELISE
          What were you like as a. kid?

                         DAVID
          Before sixth grade I spent about
          half my time in the principal's
          office.

                         ELISE
          You? Really?

                         DAVID
          The only person who spent as much
          time down there as me was a girl I
          had a huge crush on so I didn't
          mind too much.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 82.
          A smile spreads on Elise's face.

                         ELISE
          (re: the docks)
          Did your dad work here?

                         DAVID
          No... My dad filled vending
          machines.

                         ELISE
          And you're going to be a
          senator...

                         DAVID
          After my brother died my Dad wanted
          to get me out of town for a while.
          We went to Washington and the day
          we arrived he took meto the.
          Capitol. We ended up sitting in
          the Senate gallery;,all day.
          (re: Financial' District
          across the river)
          We could see that from the end of
          my block, but-be never once
          encouraged me to go to Wall Street.
          His idol was JFK. He thought
          business guys were selfish.

                         ELISE
          So...areyou doing all this-:f.or
          him?

                         DAVID
          I want to matter. I don't think
          that's just forrhim.
          Elise,. tucks her head into his shoulder.

                         ELISE
          I don't want tonight to mess
          anything..up for you, for the
          campaign.

                         DAVID
          Just make sure I make it to Diane
          Sawyer on time and I'll be fine.
          Elise looks at him for a long beat.

                         ELISE
          You're different... somehow you make
          me believe...

                         DAVID
          Believe what?

          PUSH IN on the window of an apartment.

          INT. ELISE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

          David and Elise make love, FOCUS so SHALLOW that even their
          faces are not always sharp.

          INT. ELISE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

          David and Elise lie together, spent.

                         ELISE
          (vulnerability we barely
          glimpsed before this)
          I don't let people in, David. And
          I never let them in this quickly.
          David pulls her close., He-,can't see her eyes. But we can.
          She's struggling with something more...

                         ELISE
          I haven'::t lead a perfect life

                         DAVID
          I. don't want perfect.,.

          ELISE. ,
          :(emotion,weI9ing)
          I'm trying to say .I'm not sure
          somebody running. for office can
          have, me in their life.
          David turns her around so he can see her face, so he knows
          for sure she hears this:

                         DAVID
          I haven't stopped thinking about
          you since the moment I met you. I
          want you in my life--

                         ELISE
          There are skeletons in my closet,
          David. The kind that--

                         DAVID
          Listen to me--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 84.

                         ELISE
          The kind that people use against--

                         DAVID
          Elise, listen! I don't care.
          We'll work it out... I've spent my
          whole life wondering why it takes
          auditoriums of people to fill the
          empty space inside me. Then I met
          you...and realized it doesn't.
          She looks at him. He means it.

                         ELISE
          You scare me.

                         DAVID
          (after a beat)
          That wasn't the effect I was going
          for...
          She smiles...then laughs out-loud--

          7 Thompson's aides seem surprised by the answer.

           INT. ELISE'S APARTMENT -- MORNING -- FRIDAY

          David wakes to find Elise looking at him.

                         DAVID
          You been up long?

                         ELISE
          No.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 85.

                         DAVID
          Did you wake up in. the middle of
          the night?

                         ELISE
          Slept straight through.

                         DAVID
          I thought you never sleep through.

                         ELISE
          I don't.

                         (BEAT)
          I told you, you scare me.
          He kisses her.

                         DAVID
          I won't hurt you.
          They kiss more... and then get swept up by it...

                         LATER
           They lie in bed, post-coital, drained. Blissful. Until the
          phone rings. It's 6:17 am. Early for a call.

                         ELISE
          Hello? :Why, are you calling?

                         (LISTENS)
          No...I... . Look, I have to go...
          She hangs up. David looks at her.

                         DAVID
          What's wrong..

                         ELISE
          That was my , ex. Adrian.

                         DAVID
          Oh... I didn't-- I guess we hadn't
          gotten to that stuff yet...

                         ELISE
          He hasn't called since we broke up.

                         DAVID
          How long?

                         ELISE
          Three months.

                         DAVID
          Was it serious?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 86.
          An awkward beat. Elise opts for complete honesty.

                         ELISE
          We were engaged.

                         DAVID
          What happened?
          Complete honesty.

                         ELISE
          He left...
          David can feel this in the pit of his stomach now.

                         DAVID
          What an idiot.

                         ELISE
          You don't know me that well yet.
          You're still in the wishful
          thinking phase.

                         (BEAT)
          Truth is I should.;-Have left him a
          long time before he left me. It
          was a ,ain' l relationship. It
          hurt tb be i-h it every day.

                         DAVID
          But it was:h'ard to leave.

                         ELISE
          H& knew what buttons., tb push.

                         DAVID `'
          that him?
          DtTid paints at pica re of Elise with an attractive man, arms
          wound each other. lis'e looks surprised, shocked even, to
          tY%'e photo on her b okcase. She nods.

                         ELISE
          David... . It's not... It's over
          between us. Completely over...I
          want to be clear about that. I'm
          pretty sure yesterday was the most
          perfect day I've ever had.

                         DAVID
          Me too.
          David looks at the clock.

                         DAVID
          I have this Diane Sawyer interview.

          It comes out awkward.

                         ELISE
          I know.
          So did that. They look at each other. Then David reaches
          for his clothes--

                         ELISE
          Can I come? My dress rehearsal's
          not until nine.
          David's face lights up.

                         ELISE
          I'm afraid if I let you out of my
          sight. . .you know...I might never
          see you again...
          A smile creeps across his face...

                         DAVID
          I think Americans are tired of
          electing automatons whose every
          word and move is stage-managed so
          as not to offend anyone. I think
          they want somebody who doesn't hide
          who he is or what he really
          believes. I guess I'm hoping they
          want to elect someone who's
          actually like them.

                         (LAUGHS)
          But I could be very wrong about
          that.

          underwear companies that have

          Diane bursts out laughing. The floor techs are laughing too.

          David stays to speak to Diane for a moment-as we MOVE to
          find a stagehand'who is shifting the position of one of the
          big video cameras sed to tape the show. We catch a glimpse
          of his face and see it's Thompson's aide.
          INT<. Gk 2N- R0014 -- DAY
          The- "stagehand" moves thecamera so it's blocking the window
          giving Elise line-of sight to David and Diane.
          Just. then a man with an-.ABC ID enters the room to speak to
          Elise. (We only see his lower half.)

                         ABC ID
          Ma'am, Congressman Norris asked me
          to give you a message.
          We MOVE UP from his ID to REVEAL that the man is another one
          of Thompson's aides.

          THOMPSON AIDE #2 (ABC ID)
          He was just called into a meeting
          that he says is urgent. He says
          he'll call you later and see you at
          your show tonight.

          INT. STUDIO -- DAY

          David and Diane say goodbye to each other. He salutes the
          floor staff, who actually applaud. They love him.

                         DIANE SAWYER
          (to David, re: earpiece)
          They're saying your girlfriend --
          can we call her that? Is this one
          going to last more than a month?

                         DAVID
          You can call her that. And yes.
          Definitely.
          David is looking at a text from Elise as he speaks. It says:
          "I want to go to bed with you."

                         DIANE SAWYER
          They're saying she's getting a tour
          of the control room in studio C.
          Can somebody take Congressman
          Norris to studio C?
          Thompson's aide signals David to follow him. David does.
          They walk through a couple thick doors into the corridor.

          INT. CORRIDOR -- DAY

          Thompson's aide leads him through a heavy door marked "Studio
          C" into a, vestibule and then through another heavy door into--

          INT. '':STUDIO C" -- DAY

           A partially-built set in the center of an empty stage. Elise
           isn't here. Thompson's aide feigns surprise.

           T HOMPSON'S AIDE #2
           They said she was here... . Hang on.
          David pulls his blackberry out sees there is no signal. He
          looks up to see Thompson's aide exit through the stage door.
          It suddenly clicks for David, and he rushes to the door.
          Yanks on it. It's locked.

                         DAVID
          God dammit!

          INT. CORRIDOR -- DAY

          Through the thick window of the outer door we can see David
          pounding on the window of the inner door.
          But we can't hear a sound.
          PULL BACK to REVEAL Thompson's aide removing the"Studio C"
          placard. Beneath is the true designation: "Studio D."
          PAN to REVEAL three Thompson aides removing a false wall that
          was hiding a bunch of construction equipment and setting up
          "No Entry -- Construction Zone" signs.

          QUICK CUTS -- FRANTIC HANDHELD
          1) David across the room tugs on another exit. It's locked.
          2) David pulls a fire alarm. Nothing.
          3) David slams on the door with a two-by-four.

          LONGER CUTS -- COMPOSED DOLLY SHOTS
          1) Diane Sawyet talks about the issue of the day as we pull
          back and show her. co-hosts on the couch.
          2) Elise arrives in the lobby of the Manhattan Modern Ballet
          for her company's dress rehearsal.

          INT STUDIO D (EARLIER ".STUDIO'.C") -- DAY
           David sits. His tie..loose now. His jacket off. He glances
          at his blackberry. the time reads 4:13 pm. He yells in
          frustration.

                         VOICE
          If people could hear you out there
          it wouldn't be a very good
          soundstage, would it?
          David turns to see Thompson, in the now familiar dark suit
          and fedora.

                         THOMPSON
          My name's Thompson.

                         DAVID
          What happened to Free Will?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 92.

                         THOMPSON
          Who said anything about Free Will?
          David stares back at him.

                         THOMPSON
          You know, we actually tried Free
          Will before. After taking you from
          hunting and gathering to the height
          of the Roman Empire we stepped back
          to see how you'd do on your own.
          You gave us the Dark Ages -- for
          five centuries -- until finally we:
          decided we should come back in.

                         (BEAT)
          The Chairman thought maybe we just
          needed to do a better job of
          teaching you how to ride the bike
          before we took the training wheels
          off again. So we gave you the
          Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the
          Scientific Revoluton.:ï¿½we spent
          six hundred years tempering your
          passions with reason.,then in 1910
          we stepped ba ï¿½c again. Within
          fifty yearsï¿½you brought us World
          War I, the lepre'ssion, Fascism, the
          Holocaust ani capped it off by
          bringingtheentire planet to the
          brink of destruction in the Cuban
          Missile Crisis. A decisiOfl was
          taken atthat point that we' should
          stop in again before Â±ou did
          _soittething even we Cduldn't fix.

          you have the appearance of Free

                         DAVID
          You expect me.'to believe that?

                         THOMPSON

                         (BORED SHRUG)
          You have Free Will over what tie
          you pick in the morning, or what
          beverage to order at lunch. But
          humanity just isn't mature enough
          to have control over the important
          things.

                         DAVID
          If you're in control of the
          important things then you're
          incompetent cause when I look
          around at the world these days it
          seems pretty fucked.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 93.

                         THOMPSON
          It's still here. If we'd left
          things in your hands, it wouldn't
          be.

                         DAVID
          Why are you trying to keep me from
          Elise? Or are you just another
          lackey who doesn't really know?
          Thompson studies David for a long beat. Then decides it's
          time to level with him.

                         THOMPSON
          We put Elise in front of you three
          years ago to inspire you to, .g `ve
          that speech -- the speech that
          pulled you back from the brink of
          oblivion and, overnight, itiade.you

          And t'm not just talking about
          `elections ' for Senate.
          lowly dawns on David what Thompson is saying...

                         THOMPSON
          You can matter, David. Really
          matter. What you wanted your whole
          life. What your father wanted when
          he took you to the Senate gallery
          when you were ten. What your
          brother wanted when he made you
          promise, the day before he
          overdosed, that you wouldn't be
          like him.

                         DAVID
          Stop. Don't tell me this.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 94.

                         THOMPSON
          Why do you think you have that
          yearning to be in front of
          people. . .and that terrible
          emptiness when you're not?

                         DAVID
          Stop.

                         THOMPSON
          David you are meant to change the
          world. But that doesn't happen if
          you stay with her.

                         DAVID
          Why does it matter to you who I
          love? Some skeleton of hers `is so
          bad I won't get elected? I don't
          believe that!

                         THOMPSON
          It's not about her-:..it's about
          you, what being with her does to

                         YOU -

                         DAVID-
          What does that mean?! I'm better
          with her than I ever was alone.,
          You just said it. That speech--

                         1HOMPSON
          Yes. The speech... Put it this
          wad: in small doses, Elise was the
          cure. But in large doses... When
          you're enthralledwith someone she
          ' rubs off on you:.

          Why do you refuse to accept what
          should be completely obvious by
          now? You've seen what we can do.
          You can't doubt we are who we say
          we are.

                         DAVID
          I don't care who you are. I don't
          care who's orders you're following.

          Who said anything about running.

                         THOMPSON
          Maybe we should just reset you.

          We both know if you could have we

                         THOMPSON
          It's 6:20. If you leave now,
          you'll make Elise's show.
          David's eyebrows go up. Huh? Thompson is letting him go?

          EXT. GOOD MORNING AMERICA STUDIOS: .--..DUSK

          David jumps into a taxi.

          Elise and twb of her colleagues "finish a dance piece. The
          audience explodes into applause.
          The house lights come up half way as the stage is readied for
          the next piece,. David is startled to see that the man in the
          aisle seat next to-him is Thompson.

                         T-4 MPSON
          She's a beautiful dancer.

                         DAVID
          What do you want?

                         THOMPSON
          There's one more piece to all this
          I haven't told you. I guess I
          didn't have the heart. If you stay
          with her, it doesn't just kill your
          dreams, it kills hers.

                         DAVID
          What?

          Elise is about to become one of the
          most famous dancers in the
          country... and eventually one of the
          greatest choreographers in the
          world.

          If she stays with you... she ends up
          teaching dance to eight year-olds.

                         DAVID
          I don't believe you. I thought we
          already established that.
          A beat.

                         THOMPSON
          When you look back at all this,
          David, just remember, we tried to
          reason with you.
          Thompson gets up and leaves...just as the lights go down for
          the next dance.
          David watches him go...then turns around just in time to
          catch Elise's entrance into the dance -- a graceful jump.
          When she lands, her ankle cracks, and she falls. The
          audience gasps.
          INSERT: a floor board tilted oddly. It goes back to normal.
          FIND THOMPSON: His hand slightly outstretched.
          THE AUDIENCE instantly knows something is wrong. David jumps
          up and runs down to the.: stage door. A dancer comes from off
          stage and helps Elise off the floor as the show continues.

          David arrives. Sees Elise's face. Tears streaming down her
          cheeks. Seeing David...

                         ELISE
          If it's broken...my career's over.

                         DAVID
          Don't say that. Don't.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 98.

          INT. TAXI -- NIGHT

           The taxi rushes to the hospital. David holds her. Silently
          trying to comfort her. But he can't look at her.

          EXT. HOSPITAL -- NIGHT

          David carries her from the taxi into the emergency room...

          INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM -- NIGHT

          David sits in a black chair, alone, staring at the floor.

          INT. HOSPITAL EXAM ROOM -- NIGHT

          Elise lies on an exam table as -a tech x-rays her ankle.

          INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM NIGHT

          David is still staring at the floor. He looks-up to see
          Thompson.

                         THOMPSON
          I always hear people saying "you
          yourself for what can't bla M4'
          hpens fih other people," but in
          this case, really, you can.
          David stands up...
           . and punnhesThompson in `the face.
          h T ompson is knocked onto his ass.
          People in the waiting room stare at David. Almost everyone
          here knows his fade. He looks at them, unable to summon his
          usual wit.

                         THOMPSON
          This is what you do, David.

                         (GETTING UP)
          This is what you did the first
          night you got elected. This is
          what you did at that college
          reunion. We give you opportunities
          people would kill for and you
          squander them with impulse. It
          doesn't take a genius to see Elise
          isn't exactly going to help you
          with that.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

           2/12/09 99.

                         THOMPSON (CONT'D)
          You want to know why you can't have
          her? Look in the mirror.
          Thompson leaves.

          INT. HOSPITAL EXAM ROOM -- NIGHT

          More X-rays of Elise's ankle. An orthopedic surgeon enters
          and examines the images on the computer screen.
          Elise, her face, still red and tear stained tries to read the

                         SURGEON'S FACE

                         ELISE
          How bad is it?
          The surgeon turns to her with a classic doctor's detachment:

                         SURGEON

                         ELISE--

          EXT. HOSPITAL COURTYARD -- NIGHT

          David sits alone on a bench. Thompson arrives.

                         THOMPSON
          You're an educated man. You've
          read the Greek tragedies`. In the
          end Fate always wins...
          David looks back at him in steely silence.

                         THOMPSON
          It a sprain.

                         DAVID
          Really?

                         THOMPSON
          This time.

                         (BEAT')
          Do you really want to watch her
          lose the only thing she's ever
          cared about? You just got the
          tiniest taste of what that looks
          like...
          The thought makes David ill.

                         THOMPSON
          Walk away. If you truly love her,
          walk away. She'll hate you for
          it...but that way she'll be able to
          let you go quickly. You can give
          her that at least.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 100.

          INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

          David stands alone. Stares at the floor. Finally
          confronting the fact that he can't beat the forces arrayed
          against him. Finally ready to make the choice being forced
          upon him...

          INT. HOSPITAL EXAM ROOM -- DAY

          David enters to find Elise with a huge smile on her face.

                         ELISE
          It's a sprain! It's just a sprain!
          David gives her a tight hug.

                         ELISE
          It's going to be okay. The doctor
          said it would heal in' a
          month. . .maybe even less.

                         DAVID
          You're going to: be fine.

                         ELISE
          They want to do an MRI...to assess
          the ligament. damage but.: -.
          They break from them hug.

                         DAVID
          It's; going to be fine. And as
          incredible of a dancer as you
          already are, yot're just going to
          get better and better...
          DavidV;embraces her again, so she won't see the tears welling
          in his eyes.

                         DAVID
          I...I have to go make a few calls.
          His voice cracks. Elise notices.

                         ELISE
          You okay?

                         DAVID
          I'm just...happy for you...

          INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

          David walks down a long corridor away from Elise's room.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 101.

          EXT. HOSPITAL -- NIGHT

          David exits the building. Thompson is waiting by the door.

                         THOMPSON
          You're doing the right thing,
          David. Not just for her, and the
          world. . .but for yourself.
          David looks at him for a beat, then turns and walks away into
          the night.

          FADE TO BLACK.

          INT. DINER -- UPSTATE NEW YORK -- MORNING

          CLOSE on a TV screen, then PULL BACK to REVEAL the diner.

          LOCAL NEWS REPORTER (ON TV):
          David Norris, who'has spent the
          last two days campaigning in the
          tri-lakes area, got some welcome
          news yesterday when the latest New
          York Times poll gave him a sixteen
          point lead over his opponent less
          than.a month before election dg t.
          FIND Charlie. He sits` at a booth eating breakfast as he
          watches TV behind the counter.
          Charlie glan ces out the window ad we FIND David standing on
          the back of apickup truck speaking to eighty people in the
          parking lot. `:It's Autumn now.
          So etthing about his{,speaking style has changed. He's not as
          ima ea or passion te.:Hedoesn't seem to enjoy it as much
          is he Â°did three years ago.
          Just then a campaign aide arrives at Charlie's table.

                         CHARLIE
          How's he doing?

                         CAMPAIGN AIDE
          They still love him... Papers?
          The aide hands Charlie a stack of papers: three local papers,
          the Times, the Journal, and the three big NYC tabloids.

                         CHARLIE
          Thanks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 102.
          The aide leaves. Charlie glances at the front page of the
          Times, then reaches for the New York / Region section. As he
          does the front page of the Arts section catches his eye.
          There is a big photo of Elise, doing an "airborne split,"
          accompanying an article titled "Dance Takes a Quantum Leap."
          Charlie glances through the window at David who is climbing
          down from the pickup truck to applause from his parking lot
          audience.

          EXT. PARKING LOT -- MORNING

          David shakes hands with people in the aftermath of his
          speech. They really do love him.

          INT. DINER, UPSTATE NEW YORK MORNING

          Charlie reads the New York Times. article. It begins:
          "Once in a generation a piece is created of
          such astounding originality and virtuosity
          that it single-handedly reshapes. the. world of
          dance."

                         FOLLOW DAVID
          As he makes his way, towards the diner'f-tom the parking lot,
          shaking handb and allowing his picture to be taken.

          INT: DINER, UPSTATE NEW YORK -- DAY
          David sits down with Charlie.

                         DAVID
          I'm started.

                         CHARLIE
          I'm going to show you this because
          you'd find out eventually and
          because I want to be here when you
          do.
          Charlie turns the Arts section around for David to see it.
          Elise's photo has a noticeable impact on David. He glances
          at the article for a moment.
          Then Charlie points down near the bottom, at a particular

                         SENTENCE:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 103.
          "The show's choreographer, Adrian Troussant,
          and lead dancer, Elise Sellas, are partners on
          and off stage and plan to marry in New York
          next week."
          David stares at the words...

                         CHARLIE
          David?
          (off no response)
          David?

                         DAVID
          I think I need... I...

                         CHARLIE
          Take a day off. Take a couple.
          We're sixteen points up.

                         DAVID

                         (HOLLOWED OUT)
          Even I can't blow a lead that big.

          EXT. RED HOOK, BROOKLYN NIGHT

          It's pouring rain. David walks down Carroll Street. Most of
          the row houses display "Norris for Senate" signs.
          Most of the housing here is run-down but this block is
          clearly in the early'stages of gentrification.
          David pays particular attention to one row house as he passes
          by. Was this his house?

          EXT. / INT. NEIGHBORHOOD DAR -- NIGHT

          There's a "Norris for Senate" sign prominently displayed in
          the window. David enters this classic dive bar and goes to
          the bartender.

                         DAVID
          Do you still serve neighborhood
          guys here or just the tourists?
          The bartender smiles big. A couple people at the bar notice
          him. Then others notice and they start whooping it up for
          him. He doesn't know any of them-but they sure know him.

          EXT. RED HOOK DOCKS -- NIGHT

          David sits under the huge aluminum roof on one of the piers,
          holding a bottle of beer in a soaked paper bag.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 104.
          There are no walls to this structure so rainwater pours off
          the roof on all four sides forming virtual walls.
          A figure in a suit approaches David from behind. He turns
          to see the man.

                         DAVID
          Why are you here?
          REVERSE to REVEAL Harry, in a suit and raincoat.

                         HARRY
          I would have come earlier but I had
          to wait for the rain.
          (off David's confusion)
          Water interferes with their ability
          to sense your decision tree.
          That's why we met on a boat last
          time.

                         (BEAT)
          I guess I'm here to set the record
          straight.

                         DAVID
          About what?

                         HARRY-
          Thompson was lying when he said
          they couldn't let you be with 8lise
          because :it would bring out your
          reckless side.

                         DAVID
          Why, then? Why do they care so
          much?

                         HARRY
          8ecause.,..she's enough, David. If
          you have =her r tau rtt .ght not need to
          fill the d side you with votes
          and ataplause'and dreams of one day
          becoming p sident...
          if Harry has:looked straight into David's soul.

                         HARRY
          I've watched you a long time.
          They're right to want you in the
          White House. It would be good for
          the world. That's important but it
          can't be the only thing that
          matters.

                         DAVID
          Why are you so different than they
          are?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 105.
          A long beat, then:

                         HARRY
          You know, your Dad was a smart man.
          He could have been a lot more --
          and he wanted to be. So did your
          brother. But the Plan didn't call
          for that.
          This hits David hard.

                         HARRY
          In my job, you implement the
          Plan...

                         (EMOTIONAL)
          And most of the time.. .you don't
          even know why...

                         (BEAT)
          I'm sorry...

                         DAVID
          My mom?

                         HARRY
          That wasn't me... that wasn't us at
          all.
           David takes all this in. After a;long be t he takes a drink.
           Then he offers the bottle to Harry, who h a esitates, then takes
          a drink as well.

                         DAVID
          When Thompson told methe choice
          as Elise or the White House I
          barely hesitated.

                         D1 ID
          But the trt t i `is after making that
          choice I went into a free-fall...
          Don't get=me wrong, it killed me to
          see Thompson hurt her...but I used
          it as an excuse. I think I left
          her more to save my career than
          hers.

                         (STRUGGLING)
          Thompson wasn't lying. The press is
          already talking about me as a
          future president. I'm phoning in
          my speeches and I'm still sixteen
          points up in the polls.

                         HARRY
          The public loves you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 106.

                         DAVID
          Before I met Elise that was all
          that mattered. Now I hardly
          notice. She's all I think about.

                         (BEAT)
          Do you know where she's getting
          married?

                         HARRY
          Front of a judge. Tomorrow
          morning.

                          DAVID
          Is she happy with him? Tell me she
          is and I'll walk away.

                          HARRY
           Thompson won't let you get near
          that courthouse.

          Harry... is she happy?

                         HARRY
          No.
          A beat.

                         DW-ID
          I have to get her back..
          Harry knows how unlikely that is.

                         DAVID
          Will you help me:ï¿½ Just help me
          get to her...

                         HARDY
          They'll sense )tOu coming a mile
          away.'

                         DAVID
          What if Icould move as fast as you
          can?

                         HARRY
          What do you mean?

                         DAVID
          Teach me about the doors.

                         HARRY
          How do you know about that?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 107.

                         DAVID
          The first day, after they caught
          me, they carried me through one.I
          thought it was a hallucination at
          first. Eventually I realized it's
          how you move around so fast.
          (off Harry's reluctance)
          If you don't want to help me
          because of what they'll do to
          you...okay, that's your choice.
          But if this is about protecting me
          then shouldn't the choice be mine?

                         HARRY
          Do you have any idea how
          complicated it is to navigate
          through those doors... how many
          thousands of permutations there are
          in even a simple several block
          journey?

                         DAVID
          You know, when I do town hall
          meetings I usually get introduced
          to forty or fifty people between
          when I walk, through' the door and
          when I start speaking. But when
          I'm done with the speech I can call
          on each one of them by `game.
          A beat...

                         HARRY
          I've seen you do that
          (taking tl leap )
          The rain is supposed to stop in the
          nexthou'r. We're going to need all
          night to do this. And we're going
          to need aplace surrounded by water
          to do it.

                         MOMENTS LATER
          Harry and David stand outside a door to a dock office at the
          end of the pier. Harry dons his hat.

                         HARRY
          Put your hand on my shoulder. And
          don't let go until we've crossed
          the threshold.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 108.
          David complies. Harry opens the door.

                         DAVID
          Are they ever locked?

                         HARRY
          Maybe if you have a defective hat.
          They step through the door and onto--

          EXT. MANHATTAN STREETS -- NIGHT

          Harry notices as the rain slows to a drizzle.

                         HARRY

          the door. They move through i into--

          Harry stops. David takes-his hand off Harry's shoulder.
          Still amazed by what they just did.

                         HARRY
          We're underneath Canal Street,
          which c as ,,A canal before rt, was a

          You okay, sweetie?

                         ELISE

          Everything still on for tomorrow?
          Elise nods, trying to cover her ambivalence.

          MUSIC BEGINS: something that recalls the sensei-pupil scenes
          in martial arts movies, but at the same time something fluid
          and lyrical (e.g. Yoshida Brothers, "Beyond the Deep Sea.")
          Harry rolls out a block-by-block map of lower Manhattan.
          There are intricate red pen markings all over the map..

                         HARRY
          Lower Manhattan is a nightmare.
          Layer upon layer of substrate --
          that's what we call the system of
          doors -- has been added over time.
          That makes it a lot more complex to
          navigate down here than it is
          uptown. And a lot slower.
          Harry dumps out several hundred photos of doors, interior and
          exterior, all below Canal Street.

                         HARRY
          You ready?

                         DAVID

          Harry nods.

          I'd knock the Yankees cap off his
          head and go through the door before

                         DAVID
          Could I ever learn to read that?
          Harry shakes his head. Impossible.

                         DAVID
          No matter how hard I tried?

                         HARRY
          For the same reason you can't

          was a few hours ago, before the

          David looks at it, then looks away.

          I want to ask you what it

          somehow that feels ...wrong.

                         DAVID
          You're not supposed to be weeping
          on your wedding day, Elise.
          Elise fights the emotion again welling inside.

                         DAVID
          You were never happy with Adrian.
          You told me that.
          Elise puts her head in her hands.

                         ELISE
          This is so screwed up. Oh,-God..

                         DAVID

          David looks back at her... Just looks at her. Then he leans
          over and wipes a tear from her face. And he decides...
          He just decides.

                         DAVID
          But at least you'll know the truth.

                         (BEAT)
          I saw behind the curtain, Elise. I
          saw this.
          He opens up Harry's Planbook. Elise sees the intricate
          "wiring diagrams." Sees the lines shift on the page. It
          startles her.

                         DAVID
          It's not in their "Plan" for us to
          be together. So they're trying to
          stop us.

          INT. STAIRCASE -- DAY

          Stop making things up--

          The door flies open again. David picks up a trash can and
          clobbers the fedora-wearing man who enters. He drops.

          INT. STAIRCASE -- DAY

          Thompson spins to his aide, finger in his face.

          Jesus.. .the cops are after you?!
          David grabs the shield and uses it to wedge the door closed.
          Kicks it in so it's jammed tight.

                         DAVID
          He's not a cop. He's one of them.
          Another body slams into the door now. But the shield holds
          it shut.

                         ELISE
          Who's "them?"
          SLAM! SLAM! The door cracks--

                         ELISE
          Jesus, David!. What's going on?!
          David is impossibly calm. He puts his hat back on.

                         DAVID
          I'm going to: show you.
          He takes Elise's hand, opens the bathroom door, and walks her

          minutes. Maybe less.
          Elise is still speechless. He takes her hand.

                         DAVID
          The ten year-old in me always mixed
          up winning elections with being

          the Banana Republic.

          EXT. HARLEM -- DAY

          They emerge through a door on the 125th Street Metro-North
          platform. Run down the stairs to street level.

          INT. BANANA REPUBLIC -- DAY

          Thompson and a half-dozen minions emerge from the same
          dressing room David and Elise did. The seventeen year-old
          attendant presses back against the wall, totally freaked now.

          EXT. HARLEM -- DAY

          David and Elise head toward a storefront church.

          EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE -- DAY

          Thompson and his men pour out onto the street flashing NYPD
          badges and asking questions. /

          EXT. HARLEM -- DAY

          David and Elise enter the church and--

          EXT STONE FACADE -- DAY
          -- exit from a metal door in a stone facade. PULL BACK to
          REVEAL that they are standing at the base of the Statue of
          Liberty...
          Elise looks out at the harbor and the city. Rain pelts her
          face. And she smiles. Exhilarated. Like a prisoner who has
          just broken her chains...

          EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE -- DAY

          Rain bounces off the dozen long black raincoats worn by
          Thompson and his men. A black Suburban with under-grill
          police lights pulls up fast.

          DRIVER OF SUBURBAN
          The Intervention Team has
          pinpointed an interception point.
          Thompson circles his finger in the air to tell his men to
          saddle up, they're moving out--

          EXT. STATUE OF LIBERTY -- DAY

          Elise isstill smiling.

                         DAVID
          Let's go.

                         ELISE
          We can't keep running forever,.
          David.

                         DAVID
          If they find us ...they'll take you
          from me.

                         ELISE
          I won't let..them.

                         DAVID
          They'll take you from here.
          David touches his head'.

                         ELISE
          No, I won't let them.
          She leans,-.over and kisses hi's forehead.

          INT T. ?RE 'WAR APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY
           David and Elise exit into a hallway with eight doors on it.

                         DAVID
          Perfect.
          David picks a door. It's locked. He tries another. It's

                         ONE --
          locked too. He tries a third. Locked. Elise tries
          shakes her head.

                         DAVID
          They're not supposed to be locked!
          David hears sounds coming from the building's central
          staircase. He looks down it to see four men in silver suits
          climbing up the stairs.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 127.
          DING. The elevator door down the hall opens. More men in
          silver suits.

                         ELISE
          This one's open!
          Elise is standing at the door to the roof. David runs to her
          and they go up the stairs together to--

          EXT. ROOF -- DAY

          David pushes the roof door shut, barricades it with some
          concrete blocks sitting on the roof. Rain pours down on
          them.
          They rush to the edge of the roof. ,Three Con Edison vans are
          parked haphazardly on the street below. And a dozen
          civilians on the sidewalk are frozen..11: ;
          David grabs Elise and they go to the side of the roof, the
          roof of the building next door is ten feet below them. They
          hang their legs over the edge and jump.
          They sprint across the roof of the building next door --
          except somehow they find themselves running across the same
          roof they were just on.
          David sees the concrete blocks he placed against the door a
          moment ago. The door bangs against theme being shoved open
          from inside.
          David and Elise run back in the c5,pposite direction. At the
          building's edge they climb over again and... run...
          Only to find that theyare still on the first roof they were
          on. It's like they're in an.Escher painting.
          They stop, and look at each other. David takes her hand as
          Adjustment Team trsapers appear all around them from adjacent
          roofs. They're completely surrounded.

                         ELISE
          Kiss me.
          Tears well in her eyes. And his.

                         ELISE
          Close your eyes and kiss me.
          He does. And they kiss in the rain...

                         ELISE
          I love you, David Norris.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 128.
          They hold each other for a long beat ... . and then, finally,
          open their eyes.. .ready to accept their fate--
          They see an empty roof. The Silver Suits are gone. And the
          rain has stopped. A strange silence envelopes them...
          They spin the other direction to see The Chairman, standing
          there, alone.

                         THE CHAIRMAN
          Hello, David... Good morning,
          Elise.
          His voice is gentle, paternal.

                         DAVID
          Who are you?

                         THE CHAIRMAN
          I think you know.
          David and Elise stand in awe'-'as they realize.

                         DAVID
          You can't oti{rn Fate...
          Tft , CHAIRMAN
          It's .more- complicated t,}an that,
          Fate am Free Will coexist
          They're;in tension with each other.
          And pure chance.
          A beat. David looks back at him...

                         DAVID

          TH2;.>ï¿½HAT, RMAN
          I could control 'everything. You'd
          be ha` 3 ou' d be puppets. I
          try to .keep things from getting too
          out of control. But that has a
          cost. Most people go through life
          like pinballs, reacting predictably
          to the stimuli I apply. They
          accept the path they find
          themselves on. And perform
          accordingly. But every once in a
          while someone comes along who
          refuses to be bound by his fate,
          someone who understands that Free
          Will is a gift most people are too
          afraid to use.

                         (BEAT)
          Which, you see, is partly the point
          of all this.

                         

                         

                         

                         

           2/12/09 129.
          THE CHAIRMAN (cont'd)
          Or maybe you don't see it. Maybe
          you just feel it. And that's even
          better. Because that's the other
          part.
          David and Elise take it in...

                         DAVID
          And all the misery, all the pain...

                         THE CHAIRMAN
          I sit up there and I watch it and
          it hurts me... . but if you could see
          the incredible courage people show,
          the random acts of kindness, the
          love... If you could see huitan
          beings choosing every moment
          every day to be better thAn'' I made
          them, you would know it's all
          worthwhile.

                         (BEAT)
          Good luck, David. And good luck to
          you, Elise. You're a-beautiful
          dancer. And so much more...
          The Chairman turns to his aide, who we didn't know was there.

                         THE CHAIRMAN
          Their case isclosed.

          AIDE TO THE CHAIRRMAN
          But, Sir,isn't this a majtr.
          deviation from The Plan?
          The Chairmen turns to another aide who is holding a folio
          open and signs- a document on -ery heavy paper.

                         THE CHAIRMAN
          Not anymc3e .
          David and Elise watc]i The Chairman walk away, still awed by
          what=they've just experienced. As He disappears around a
          corner, the sun comes out from behind the clouds ...
          After a long beat, Elise turns back to David, as if to say
          "what do we do now?"

                         DAVID
          Maybe we should go dancing.
          A smile slowly spreads across her face ...

                         THE END
