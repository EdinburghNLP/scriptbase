</b>


                                  Written by

                                 George Nolfi


                           Based on a short story by

                                 Philip K Dick



 
<b>          BLACK SCREEN
</b>
          The sounds of a large crowd, but muffled, as if we're inside,
          and hearing the crowd through a window or door. FADE IN ON:

<b>          INT. SOME SORT OF LOBBY -- DAY
</b>
          DAVID NORRIS, 33, is having a private moment, looking down,
          thinking. He wears a suit and tie. He seems relaxed and
          confident. Content. Completely in his element.
          In one of his hands he's absentmindedly twirling a couple of
          individually-wrapped Ricola throat lozenges. We hear the
          muffled voice of someone on a PA system outside:

<b>          VOICE ON PA SYSTEM
</b>          Thank you so much for coming today--
          A man in a BLUE BLAZER walks up to David.

<b>                         BLUE BLAZER
</b>          Congressman Norris-?
          Now REVEAL that we're Â±fl: the entry hall of the Admin Building
          at St. Johns University. A thousand people crowd the quad
          out front. "Norris for Senate" placards everywhere.

<b>                         BLUE-BLAZER
</b>          Fred O'Malley with the DNC. I've
          never seen a crowd this big turn
          out so early in the cycle.
          CHARLIE TRAYNOR, 36, arrives--.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Just wait 'till you see how they
          respond to him..
          David pops a cherry lozenge into his mouth and straightens
          his lapel pin, which is shaped like New York State.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          Don't build me up like that,
          Charlie. He'll be disappointed.

<b>          EXT. ST. JOHNS UNIVERSITY -- MAIN QUAD -- DAY
</b>
          The crowd, many of them in their twenties, roars with
          approval as David walks out to the lectern on the steps of
          the Admin Building.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          Hi there. I'm David Norris. And
          I'm running for the US Senate.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          2/12/09 2.
</b>          The crowd goes wild.

<b>          MONTAGE -- SENATE CAMPAIGN
</b>          --David finishes a speech at the FDNY Academy's graduation.
          The cadets jump to their feet and give him a standing
          ovation.
          --David shakes the hands of workers entering a .Con Edison
          plant in Buffalo. He's a natural at this. Unlike most
          politicians he actually seems to enjoy campaigning.
          --Flashbulbs go off as he plays a game of pick-up basketball
          with a group of Bronx teenagers. Charlie is nearby.
          --David takes a ceremonial shovel full of dirt to begin
          redevelopment of an old military base upstate.
          --He gives a speech at a Harlem church. Audiences watch
          David the way they watched JFK, the way they watch Obama
          today. He inspires, makes them believe, makes them want to
          follow him. Especially young people.
          --David walks through a suburban mall happily shaking hands
          as cameras follow him and citizens snap pictures with their
          camera-phones. People crush around him. He:doesn't seem to
          mind at all. He welcomes it. He feeds off it.
          --He pops a cherry lozenge in his mouth and climbs up onto a
          tractor to speak to a gathering of upstate farmers, speaking
          into a bullhorn to compensate for his hoarse voice. Charlie
          stands nearby watching him speak:.

<b>          INT. SHERATON HOTEL ROOM --UPSTATE SOMEWHERE -- DUSK
</b>
          David enters his hotel room. The silence contrasts starkly
          with the noisy energy of the campaign trail.
          He turns on the TV. Scrolls through the channels. After a
          moment shuts it off. Total silence again. It bothers him.
          He opens up his briefcase. Pulls out a thick file -- his
          itinerary for the next three days. Dozens of speeches and
          meetings across the state.
          He glances at the summary page on the top. Glances down the
          page with his finger, stopping, almost at random, on a speech
          he's giving two days from now at the Westchester County Open
          Space Initiative.

<b>                         DAVID

          Bob.

          Wife: Anna. St. John's grad. Two
          year old: Loyita...
          He stops. Knows this cold. His finger runs down to a
          Realtor's Association breakfast in Nassau County four days
          out.

<b>                         DAVID

</b>          Abagail "Abby" Best, Stuart
          Broxterman, Chapel Davis, Milan
          Sabovic, Jim Vargas...
          His ability to retain this sort of information is stunning.
          He doesn't need to review. It's already all there.
          He closes his itinerary file. Goes to the window and looks
          out at the trees.
          The silence back...it's deafening.

<b>          INT. SHERATON LOBBY -- UPSTATE SOMEWHERE -- NIGHT
</b>
          Charlie enters the lobby. Stops suddenly: spots David,
          holding court at`the hotel bar. Fifteen strangers around him
          as he regales them with a story, despite the fact that he's
          clearly losing his voice. Charlie walks over, pulls him
          aside.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          What the hell? What happened to
          "I'm going to have softie tea, rest
          my voice, and go to bed early?"
          You have Diane Sawyer tomorrow and
          you have to be up at four AM for us
          to make it in time.
          David is holding ,a beer, in his left hand. With his free hand
          he picks up a cup and saucer.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          I had some tea.
          (sees Charlie's not in the

<b>                         MOOD)
</b>          Come on, man. We're eight points
          up in the polls. I've gotta cut
          loose every once in a while and
          have a life.
          This provokes a quizzical look from Charlie. Fifteen
          strangers in a crappy upstate Sheraton doesn't seem like
          having a life to him...

</b>          What?

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Latest poll has you ten points up.
          A slow smile spreads across David's face.

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>
<b>                         BLACK SCREEN
</b>          The sound of a busy room. Then one voice, much louder:

<b>          CAMPAIGN AIDE.
</b>           County reporting: 8901 for
          Lynfield, 7233 for Norris.

<b>          INT. WALDORF ASTORIA HOTEL SUITE -- NIGHT
</b>
          Charlie Traynor walks over to the aide who just shouted that.
          She's writing vote totals onto a map of New York by county.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>
<b>                         (NATURAL OPTIMIST)
</b>          Better than I thought, I thought
          we'd get killed in Seneca.
          He turns to look at a large suite full of more than a dozen
          Norris supporters talking on phones and typing into laptops.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Eddie, call Boyd! Where the hell
          are the. Suffolk numbers? We've got
          to get the Suffolk numbers!

<b>          EXT. ROOFTOP NEAR WALDORF -- NIGHT
</b>
          A light snow falls. Four MEN IN CONSERVATIVE SUITS,
          overcoats, and fedoras walk across the roof of a forty-story
          building. Their clothing is more timeless than old-
          fashioned. And somehow so is their demeanor.
          The men get to the edge and look down over the city, almost-
          as if it's their domain.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          2/12/09 5.
</b>
<b>          INT. WALDORF HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
</b>
          David watches the election coverage on TV. Pundits are
          discussing the New York Senate race, which CNN has already
          called for David's opponent.

<b>                         PUNDIT #1
</b>          Congressman Norris has a reputation
          for being very direct, even blunt,
          in his campaign speeches, which is
          great until you say too many things
          you wish you hadn't. Then you
          start to look like an amateur.

<b>                         PUNDIT #2
</b>          That's bad for any candidate but
          it's fatal if you're running for
          Senate at the age of 33, your
          opponent keeps calling you an
          "impulsive kid," and you almost
          killed your entire political career
          five months ago with an act of
          immaturity that ended up on the
          front page of`.the New York Post.
          David winces slightly. This is excruciating. Just then
          Charlie enters.. The nerve center.suite is visible through
          the open door behind him.

          line the front of the hotel. There will be no peace for him

           David enters the huge, ornate, men's room and goes to the row
          of sinks. He pulls two Ricola cherry lozenges from his
          pocket. He twirls them in his hands for a moment.
          Then tosses them into the trash can. He looks at himself in
          the mirror, fighting to hold himself together.
          A sound behind him. David spins to see a WOMAN exiting one
          of the stalls. She's in a stunning ball gown and carrying an
          expensive bottle of champagne.

<b>                         WOMAN

          A beat. She shrugs.
          Then they lean toward each other... and kiss. It turns more

          That stops him for a moment. Until the phone RINGS again.

<b>                         WOMAN
</b>          Oh my God! How do you stand it?
          She drops the phone into the coffee.

<b>                         WOMAN
</b>          There. We're even.
          He stares at her. Incredulous. They lock eyes. God knows
          what would come next if they were in private...
          The fourth RING gurgles up through the coffee. A beat.

<b>                         WOMAN

          She pulls the phone out of the cup and wipes it off with her
          scarf, pushing the button which sends the call to voice mail.
          Then she reaches out her hand, as if to shake.

          Elise exits.. the bus. David stands at the bus door watching
          her. She turns back to look at him.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          The morning after .I lost I woke up
          thinking about you .
          That melts her. Instantly. All her bravado drops.

<b>          INT. BUS -- MORNING
</b>
          Moments later. Through the window, David watches Elise
           walking down the sidewalk. Their eyes meet. She blows him
           a little kiss before she turns the corner. His heart skips
          a beat as the bus continues on down Union Square East.

          David looks at Elise's number, scribbled on a piece of paper.
          He carefully tucks her number into his wallet. Then takes
          the most satisfying sip of coffee he's ever had in his life--

<b>          EXT. UNION SQUARE -- MORNING
</b>
          Spotting David through the bus window, Harry thrusts his
          Fedora back onto his head and points at the bus--

</b>
          Just as David finishes his sip the-plastic lid pops off the
          cup. A second earlier and the coffee would have poured all
          over his shirt. Instead it spills: on the floor.

          tire.

          David looks at his phone. "Call Lost" on the screen. David

          Harry is sitting now, wincing, but still searching intently
          for something.

<b>                         HARRY

           Harry points at his leather portfolio on the pavement a few
          feet away. We'll come to know it as a "PLANBOOK."

</b>          Are you sure you're okay?
          The driver hands it to him. Harry flips to a bookmarked
          page and we get our first good look at that circuit diagram:
          Thousands of interconnected lines. Dozens of geometric
          symbols at intersection points. And written notations in a
          language as complex as Sanskrit crossed with Chinese.
          And, maybe it's just a trick of the light but several of the
          lines appear to re-arrange themselves on the page.

</b>
          Empty, except for a bored-looking security guard at the other

          David walks past the receptionist She's on the phone. He

<b>          INT. RSR CAPITAL OFFICES -- MORNING
</b>
           David enters to find the office suite quiet... Not a soul
          in sight. Not a single secretary is here.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          (loud, playful)
          Doesn't anybody bother getting in

          David passes a couple of empty offices on his way towards a
          large corner suite where a secretary sits outside an office
          marked "Charles Traynor, Chairman." She's smiling.

</b>          Susan?
          He leans across her desk, touches her arm. She stays dead
          still. David rushes through Charlie's door:

<b>                         DAVID

          --and rushes in to find that Charlie is frozen too -- with
          the phone up to his ear. Like he's in a wax museum.
          He is surrounded by four men in bulky, metallic silver
          protective suits .(think airport firefighter gear).
          One of the men adjusts three metal. probes which are attached
          to the left side.of Charlie's skull.

<b>                         DAVID

          Three men in business suits talking by the window spin to see
          David. it's Mr. Richardson and-two aides we recognize as the
          "security guards" who chased Elise away on election night.

<b>          DAVID (,.CONT'D)
</b>          What the hell are you doing?!
          Richardson blinks Clearly surprised. Then:

</b>          Grab him!
          David bolts out of the office as they lunge at him--

<b>          INT. RSR OFFICE FLOOR -- MORNING
</b>
          David sprints toward the door he came in. It closes as he
          gets there. He grabs it. It's locked.
          He sprints away into an internal hallway. Richardson emerges
          from a door in the middle of the hallway.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          2/12/09 27.

<b>                         RICHARDSON
</b>          You can't get away, David.
          David spins and rushes back into the main office, then down
          an internal staircase to the floor below. Jumps the last
          five steps and hits the floor hard.
          As he comes up he runs smack into another RSR employee who is
          frozen solid.
          David curses, then dives around the frozen employee to find
          Richardson, coming out of another office. down the hall.
          Again, physically impossible for him to get there that fast--
          David spins and-- A DISTORTED WIDE ANGLE SHOT of a
          chloroform rag shoved right at us. FOCUS GOES IN AND OUT...
          FROM DAVID'S POV, BLURRY FOCUS as he's carried toward one of
          the large corner offices on the 40th floor.
          The nameplate reads "Steve Kincaid."
          Richardson opens the door and ushers his men, carrying David,

          David, who is tied to a chair facing away from Richardson,

          Richardson turns and studies David. Then walks over to him.
          An uncomfortable pause.

<b>                         DAVID

          David stares back at him for a moment.
          then leaps up. His rope comes off and the chair falls. He
          sprints toward an open door forty feet across the warehouse.
          Richardson makes a little gesture with his hand--

<b>          CLOSE-UP OF THE FLOOR

          back in his chair in front of Richardson.

<b>                         RICHARDSON
</b>          Did you really think I couldn't see
          that coming?
          David dabs blood from his lip, which split during the fall.

<b>                         RICHARDSON (CONT'D)

</b>          Now,. why are you still deciding
          whether or not to run?
          David's hands go to his head`, involuntarily, an atavistic
          response, as if;s.omehow that will keep his thoughts from
          spilling out into view.

<b>                         RICHARDSON

          David's entire reality has finally been bent to the breaking
          point. He can't hang on any longer to an explanation for all
          this based in the world he's known to date...

</b>          You just saw behind a curtain you
          weren't even supposed to know was
          there, Mr. Norris. Its jarring.
          I'm sure.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          I just... came to work...

<b>                         RICHARDSON
</b>          It wasn't your fault. Your Path
          through the world this morning was
          supposed to be adjusted.
          (glancing bitterly at
          Harry, in the corner)
          Your coffee was supposed to.spill
          onto your shirt as you left
          Starbucks near your apartment.
          You would have gone up to change
          and arrived at work ten minutes
          later than you did. By then we
          would have left.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          People call it "chance" when their
          coffee spills or their internet
          goes down or they misplace their
          keys. Sometimes it is. Sometimes
          it's:us...nudging you back on Plan.
          David takes all this in. He's still shell-shocked.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          Whatever you were doing to Charlie
          back there... it wasn't misplacing
          his keys.

<b>                         RICHARDSON
</b>          Sometimes. when nudging a person
          back on Plan isn't enough we
          intervene directly.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          Why Charlie? What did you do to
          him.

<b>                         RICHARDSON
</b>          You need to worry about getting
          back on your Plan, David, not worry
          about us putting him back on his.
          David stares back, still trying to get his bearings.

<b>                         RICHARDSON (CONT'D)
</b>          Only a handful of human beings know
          what you now know, David. We're
          determined to keep it that way.

<b>                         RICHARDSON (CONT'D)
</b>          So before I let you go, you need to
          understand something: If you ever
          reveal our existence we will erase
          your brain. Your memories, your
          emotions, your entire personality
          will be expunged. Your friends and
          family will think you've gone
          crazy. You won't "think" anything
          because a blank slate can't
          "think."
          Davidstares back.

<b>                         RICHARDSON
</b>          Do you understand what I just said?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          Yes...

<b>                         RICHARDSON
</b>          Not a word. Not one word about us.

          David stands there a monent..:.not sure it's real. Richardson
          points at the door. David walks toward it.
          Just then another man comes up to Richardson.

          At.-THE DOOR
          Two men come through from outside and block David's exit.

          He holds open a Planbook for Richardson to see.

          we get an alert?

<b>          NEW MAN IN SUIT
</b>          He wasn't supposed to be on that
          bus. He was supposed to be
          changing his shirt in his
          apartment... It was a controlled
          situation. It was supposed to be.
          The new man looks at Harry.

<b>          AT THE DOOR
</b>          David looks back at Richardson.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          You said I could go.
          Richardson walks over to him.

<b>          RIC,HARDSON
</b>          You ran into a woman named Elise on
          the bus this morning?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          (:going very still)
          Why does it'matter?

<b>                         RICHARDSON
</b>          You weren't ever supposed to see
          her again.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          Why do you care.?

<b>                         RICHARDSON
</b>          Because, David, you can't be with
          her. And we didn't want to have to
          resort to this--
          Four big guys grab David and pull his arms backwards like
          prison guards incapacitating a prisoner. Richardson reaches
          into David's pocket and pulls out his wallet--

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          What the hell-- What are you--
          Richardson removes the piece of paper that Elise wrote her
          number on from David's wallet--

<b>                         DAVID (CONT'D)
</b>
<b>                         NO--

<b>          2/12/09 34.
</b>          Richardson places the wallet back in David's pocket, then
          pulls out a lighter--

<b>                         DAVID (CONT'D)
</b>          No!
          And burns Elise's number. David strains and tries to pull
          loose from the vice-like grip of the four Intervention Team
          men. But he can't get free.

<b>                         DAVID (CONT'D)
</b>          What is wrong with you people?!
          Richardson drops the paper on the floor and lets it burn.
          ON David's reaction CUT TO:

<b>          EXT. WAREHOUSE -- DAY
</b>
          David exits through a steel door., it clangs shut behind him.
          He stands there unable to proceed for a long beat then starts
          walking to the corner to orient himself.
          Down one street he spots the Manhattan Bridge, down the other
          the Brooklyn Bridge. He's in DUMBO.

<b>          INT. BROOKLYN COCKTAIL LOUNGE -- AFTERNOON

          David sits alone at the bar. His hand trembles slightly.

<b>                         BARTENDER

          Harry can see that David is still very shaken.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>          The world's exactly the same as
          it's always been. You just

          A thousand-yard stare on his face, David walks toward
          downtown Manhattan amid dozens of--pedestrian commuters.

          business as if nothing happened.

<b>          INT. 40TH FLOOR --:DAY
</b>
          David stands in ftontof the corner office labeled "Steve
          Kincaid." He hesitates, then opens it. He sees an empty
          office with a killer view of New-,York Harbor. It's strangely
          disorienting for him.

</b>          Thanks.
          David walks away, still trying to get his bearings in the new
          reality he now knows. Charlie comes around a corner.

<b>                         CHARLIE

           David sits on a bench looking at the water. The wind picks
           up and he puts his hands in his,coatpockets to keep them
           warm. His right hand feels something. He pulls out a
          ticket for the 4 pm Circle..Line tourist boat cruise.

          The boat pulls away front=the dock. It's misting rain so

          to feel pointless.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          I was` raised to believe there's
          something behind the curtain. I

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          He knew what color I was thinking.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>          Because he set it up as a choice.
          "Choose a color. Choose a number"

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          So?
          Harry looks away. He's crossing a line. He's really putting
          himself out there:

<b>                         HARRY
</b>          We can't read your mind or hear
          your thoughts. But before you make
          a choice your brain weighs options,
          and we percpite that. We know if
          you're going to go off Plan "or not
          because, as long as we're close
          enough, we cansense it when it's
          about to happen.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          it-;' s like a sixth sense for you?

<b>                         HARRY

</b>          What did they do too Charlie?

<b>                         HARRY
</b>          Made some small change in the way
          he assesses risk.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          What type of risk?

<b>                         HARRY
</b>          (this is beside the point)
          I don't know. Something arcane.

</b>          What would your colleagues do to

          telling me?
          This is precisely what Harry has been worried about.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>          That's why we're meeting out here.

<b>                         DAVID

          ON David's face considering this.

<b>          EXT. UPPER DECK DAY
</b>
          Moments later. They stand out of earshot of the few
          tourists up here.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          Why are you helping me?

<b>                         HARRY
</b>          I have my reasons.
          David studies him. Ha=rry's' clearly not ready to go into

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          Why do they care?
          Harry looks back at him. Taken aback a bit by how much David
          seems to care.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>          I don't know.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>          All I know is, given the amount of
          resources they've used, keeping you
          from her is pretty important to
          them.
          (off David's silence)
          You're going to look for her aren't
          you?
          Again, David is silent.

<b>                          HARRY (CONT'D)

<b>                         FADE TO:
</b>
<b>          EXT. MADISON SQUARE PARK -- MORNING
</b>
          Huge shafts of morning sunlight cut across the park outside
          David's apartment. The trees are blooming. It's Spring now.

<b>          INT. BEDROOM -- MORNING
</b>
          An alarm clock reads 6:29 am. David lies alone in bed. He's
           already awake, staring at the ceiling...
           After a long beat the alarm clock rings. David shuts it
          off. But then just lies there...

<b>           INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT -- MORNING
</b>
           It's the same apartment -- except it's bigger now. Instead
           of two large windows on the park, his apartment is now six
          windows across. (He has bought the two one-bedrooms next to
           his and knocked the walls down). Three years have passed.
           No files on the table, like there were the last time we were
          here. David is on the phone in a new park-view study.

<b>           CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)
</b>          How are you feeling about the
          speech?
          David has not noticeably aged and yet he's more tempered and
          subdued than when we last saw him. We `hear it in his voice:

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          I'm ready... I changed a few
          things last night.

<b>          CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)
</b>          Tell me at breakfast.

<b>          THROUGH THE WINDOW AT DAVID
</b>          David finishes his call, then looks out the window. There is
          a detachment in h-s eyes that didn't exist before. After a
          moment, he gets his=coat and heads for the door.

<b>          EXT. MADISON SQUARE PARK -- MORNING
</b>
          David exits Starbucks with a coffee. He walks across the
          park toward the same Fifth Avenue bus stop he did three years
          ado.` Even his posture and,-gait are different.

<b>          INT. BUS -- MORNING
</b>
          David enters the Ml bus. He feeds his Metrocard into the
          reader as he looks down the aisle scanning the riders.. .more
          out of habit than actual hope. He walks back to take a seat.

<b>          INT. BUS -- MINUTES LATER -- MORNING
</b>
          David stares idly out the window. His Blackberry buzzes with
          a text message. Looks down at it. Then looks back out the
          window. Suddenly his eyes snap into focus.
          DAVID'S POV: The bus passes a woman walking on the sidewalk.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          2/12/09 42.
</b>          David's head whips around, only able to see her from the back
          now. She walks like Elise. She's dressed in the same
          eclectic style. He slams the red "next stop" strip, jumps
          to his feet, and runs to the front of the bus.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          Stop the bus.

<b>                         DRIVER

</b>          Now.

<b>          EXT. EAST VILLAGE -- MORNING
</b>
          The bus stops. David jumps out on Broadway. FOLLOW him as
          he takes off across the street and runs down 12th. He
          catches up to her at University Place.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          Elise!
          The woman turns around.
          And it's her...

<b>                         ELISE
</b>          David?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          Hi.

<b>                         ELISE
</b>          Wow... How areyou.
          Reeling from the adrenaline; David takes a moment, then:

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          (from the heart)
          I rode the Ml to work every day for
          the last three years hoping one day
          I'd run into you again.
          She's amused, rather than moved, because she doesn't buy it.

<b>                         ELISE
</b>          Calling would have been easier.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          I couldn't.

<b>                         ELISE
</b>          Girlfriend wouldn't let you?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          No girlfriend.
          She looks at him with continued skepticism. But his
          expression is dead serious.

<b>                         DAVID (CONT'D)
</b>          Can we go somewhere and talk?
          She hesitates. It hurt when he didn't call. She's angry at
          herself for that, but it's the truth.

<b>                         ELISE
</b>          (re: his suit)
          Don't you have to get to work?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          I just got sick.

<b>                         ELISE
</b>          "I haven't seen you in three years -
          - You make me sick" is not an
          ideal come-on. For the record.
          David smiles. She's softening. A little. His phone
          vibrates. He pulls it out of his pocket.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          One second.

</b>          He's not being flip or clever or smooth. He's being matter-

<b>                         ELISE
</b>          What speech?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          Doesn't matter. Let's take a walk.
          His focus on her is absolute. But she's wary of getting
          reeled in again.

<b>                         ELISE
</b>          Where?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          Somewhere far. We have a lot to

<b>                         ELISE
</b>          I don't think you should cancel
          your speech. What if I don't like
          you at the end of our walk?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          I'll take my chances.

          She's still dubious. His phone vibrates. This time he turns

          Richardson makes a gesture at the TV by the bar. The picture
          changes (though we can't see to what).
          He then moves a water glass on'their table. The sun hits the
          glass and reflects into the bar area where--

          --the reflection catches the eye of a 40 year-old woman
          having a coffee at the bar with, her 65 year-old mother.
          Turning so the sun is out of,=hereyes causes the daughter to
          notice the TV: an image of David's famous concession speech
          from three years ago. A screen graphic reads "Announcing
          Today?"
          As the daughter turns back to look at her mother, she notices
          David, over her mom's shoulder...

          to see the 40-year old woman Richardson just manipulated.
          She points at the TV report on David's announcement.

          She spots something on her bookshelf (we can't see what) and
          her smile fades. She takes it and puts it in a drawer.
          Her phone vibrates. She has a text message: "Power back on

          There is a big photo of Elise, doing an "airborne split,"

          It's pouring rain. David walks down Carroll Street. Most of
          the row houses display "Norris for Senate" signs.
          Most of the housing here is run-down but this block is
          clearly in the early'stages of gentrification.
          David pays particular attention to one row house as he passes

          police lights pulls up fast.

</b>          The Intervention Team has
          pinpointed an interception point.
          Thompson circles his finger in the air to tell his men to
          saddle up, they're moving out--

          Elise isstill smiling.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          Let's go.

<b>                         ELISE

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          If they find us ...they'll take you
          from me.

<b>                         ELISE
</b>          I won't let..them.

<b>                         DAVID

          David touches his head'.

<b>                         ELISE
</b>          No, I won't let them.
          She leans,-.over and kisses hi's forehead.

<b>          INT T. ?RE 'WAR APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY
</b>           David and Elise exit into a hallway with eight doors on it.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          Perfect.
          David picks a door. It's locked. He tries another. It's

<b>                         ONE --
</b>          locked too. He tries a third. Locked. Elise tries
          shakes her head.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          They're not supposed to be locked!
          David hears sounds coming from the building's central
          staircase. He looks down it to see four men in silver suits
          climbing up the stairs.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          2/12/09 127.
</b>          DING. The elevator door down the hall opens. More men in
          silver suits.

<b>                         ELISE
</b>          This one's open!
          Elise is standing at the door to the roof. David runs to her
          and they go up the stairs together to--

<b>          EXT. ROOF -- DAY
</b>
          David pushes the roof door shut, barricades it with some
          concrete blocks sitting on the roof. Rain pours down on
          them.
          They rush to the edge of the roof. ,Three Con Edison vans are
          parked haphazardly on the street below. And a dozen
          civilians on the sidewalk are frozen..11: ;
          David grabs Elise and they go to the side of the roof, the
          roof of the building next door is ten feet below them. They
          hang their legs over the edge and jump.
          They sprint across the roof of the building next door --
          except somehow they find themselves running across the same
          roof they were just on.
          David sees the concrete blocks he placed against the door a
          moment ago. The door bangs against theme being shoved open
          from inside.
          David and Elise run back in the c5,pposite direction. At the
          building's edge they climb over again and... run...
          Only to find that theyare still on the first roof they were
          on. It's like they're in an.Escher painting.
          They stop, and look at each other. David takes her hand as
          Adjustment Team trsapers appear all around them from adjacent
          roofs. They're completely surrounded.

<b>                         ELISE
</b>          Kiss me.
          Tears well in her eyes. And his.

<b>                         ELISE
</b>          Close your eyes and kiss me.
          He does. And they kiss in the rain...

<b>                         ELISE
</b>          I love you, David Norris.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          2/12/09 128.
</b>          They hold each other for a long beat ... . and then, finally,
          open their eyes.. .ready to accept their fate--
          They see an empty roof. The Silver Suits are gone. And the
          rain has stopped. A strange silence envelopes them...
          They spin the other direction to see The Chairman, standing
          there, alone.

<b>                         THE CHAIRMAN
</b>          Hello, David... Good morning,
          Elise.
          His voice is gentle, paternal.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          Who are you?

<b>                         THE CHAIRMAN
</b>          I think you know.
          David and Elise stand in awe'-'as they realize.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          You can't oti{rn Fate...
          Tft , CHAIRMAN
          It's .more- complicated t,}an that,
          Fate am Free Will coexist
          They're;in tension with each other.
          And pure chance.
          A beat. David looks back at him...

<b>                         DAVID
</b>
<b>          TH2;.&gt;ï¿½HAT, RMAN
</b>          I could control 'everything. You'd
          be ha` 3 ou' d be puppets. I
          try to .keep things from getting too
          out of control. But that has a
          cost. Most people go through life
          like pinballs, reacting predictably
          to the stimuli I apply. They
          accept the path they find
          themselves on. And perform
          accordingly. But every once in a
          while someone comes along who
          refuses to be bound by his fate,
          someone who understands that Free
          Will is a gift most people are too
          afraid to use.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          Which, you see, is partly the point
          of all this.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>           2/12/09 129.
</b>          THE CHAIRMAN (cont'd)
          Or maybe you don't see it. Maybe
          you just feel it. And that's even
          better. Because that's the other
          part.
          David and Elise take it in...

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          And all the misery, all the pain...

<b>                         THE CHAIRMAN
</b>          I sit up there and I watch it and
          it hurts me... . but if you could see
          the incredible courage people show,
          the random acts of kindness, the
          love... If you could see huitan
          beings choosing every moment
          every day to be better thAn'' I made
          them, you would know it's all
          worthwhile.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          Good luck, David. And good luck to
          you, Elise. You're a-beautiful
          dancer. And so much more...
          The Chairman turns to his aide, who we didn't know was there.

<b>                         THE CHAIRMAN
</b>          Their case isclosed.

<b>          AIDE TO THE CHAIRRMAN
</b>          But, Sir,isn't this a majtr.
          deviation from The Plan?
          The Chairmen turns to another aide who is holding a folio
          open and signs- a document on -ery heavy paper.

<b>                         THE CHAIRMAN
</b>          Not anymc3e .
          David and Elise watc]i The Chairman walk away, still awed by
          what=they've just experienced. As He disappears around a
          corner, the sun comes out from behind the clouds ...
          After a long beat, Elise turns back to David, as if to say
          "what do we do now?"

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          Maybe we should go dancing.
          A smile slowly spreads across her face ...
