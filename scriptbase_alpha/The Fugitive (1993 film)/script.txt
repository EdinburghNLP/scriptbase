                    THE FUGITIVE

                          by

                     Jeb Stuart and David Twohy











     FADE IN:

     EXT. CHICAGO - AERIAL - NIGHT

     CREDITS BEGIN OVER:

     Snow swirls around the tall buildings of downtown Chicago.

     EXT. CHICAGO HOTEL - NIGHT

     Cars, taxis, limos line the street. A cab pulls up and MAN 
     in tuxedo moves into:

     INT. CHICAGO HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT

     THROUGH arriving guests we PICK UP the Man climbing stairs 
     to the ballroom.

     ANGLE - COAT CHECK

     The Man hands his coat to coat check woman and thanks her. 
     When he turns we get our first view of DR. RICHARD KIMBLE, 
     a tall, athletic man, with a trim beard.

     He moves from the outer lobby into a fabulously decorated 
     ballroom where a fashion show is taking place as a medical
     fundraiser. Doctors and their spouses, hospital brass and 
     sponsors mingle. Women sit near the runway watching the 
     models. Men talk by the bar. The room is packed.

     A banner over the rostrum says: "CHILDREN'S RESEARCH AND 
     AID FOUNDATION"

     Kimble is handed a glass of champagne, which he promptly 
     sets on another waiter's passing tray.

                    ROBERTS (V.O.)
          Richard...

     DR. ROBERTS, a large surgeon, pulls Kimble over to a group
     of surgeons gathered around a bar. Smoking cigars.

                    ROBERTS
          Cancun. Nat just talked everybody 
          into it...

     A hospital equipment rep, NAT, is buying drinks.

                    KIMBLE 
          So, what's the deal? If the hospital 
          buys ten new -

                    NAT
          No, no, no, no strings attached, Dr. 
          Kimble. Industrial Hospital Supply 
          has no ulterior motives.

                    KIMBLE 
          On the house, huh?
               (to bartender)
          Tonic water with lime.

     Everyone agrees.

                    KIMBLE 
          Never get me to sell my soul for one
          of those trips...

     His tone silences the group. Kimble takes his drink.

                    KIMBLE
               (to Nat)
           ... But if you get any more Bulls 
          tickets, Nat, give me a call.

     The group laughs, Kimble extracts himself and CREDITS
     CONTINUE OVER -

     CUT TO:

     KIMBLE

     Moving through the crowd.

     CUT TO:

     KIMBLE

     Nearly gets hit in the follow-through of an imaginary 
     golf swing.

                    KIMBLE 
          You're slicing, Dave. Don't turn 
          your hip.

     He keeps moving.

                    GOLFING MAN 
          Thanks, Richard...

     CUT TO:

     ANGLE - TOUGH-LOOKING LAB RAT

     KATHY WAHLUND, totally out of her element amid the formal 
     elegance around her. She wears a leather jacket over 
     T-shirt and stares at the action on the fashion runway.

                    DR. WAHLUND 
               (dripping sarcasm)
          I'm so glad you talked me into 
          coming, Richard... I can pick my
          cruise wardrobe.

                    RICHARD 
          It's for a good cause, Kath... 
          Besides you need to get out of the
          lab more. Your electron microscope
          is starting to give you a tan.

     She smiles. He moves on.

     ANGLE - PARTY

     Kimble continues down the bar when he spots a friend...

                    KIMBLE
          Hey, Jim.

     DR. JAMES NICHOLS turns, smiles. Mid-40s, head of the 
     University Hospital. He is a fit contemporary.

                    NICHOLS
          Richard, I just saw someone who 
          wanted to meet you...

     Just then Kimble spots an attractive WOMAN, late thirties, 
     wearing a drop-dead, simple black gown. She's surrounded by
     a group of men hanging on her every word. She and Kimble 
     catch a look and hold it.

                    NICHOLS (V.O.)
          Richard Kimble... Alex Lentz. Alex
          is working on the RDU90 trials for 
          Devlin-Macgregor.

     Kimble turns to meet DR. ALEXANDER LENTZ, late 30s, tan, 
     smiling. Lentz extends his hand...

                    LENTZ
          Dr. Kimble... Sorry, we've been 
          trading phone calls last few days 
          ... something about a biopsy report 
          I returned to you?

                    KIMBLE
               (suddenly attentive)
          Yeah... Three. Livers appeared 
          hepatetic to me.

                    LENTZ
          I'll be in my office in the morning 
          and I'll pull up the samples. Is that 
          a good time for you?

                    KIMBLE
          Sure.

                    LENTZ
               (holds Kimble's look, 
               then to Nichols)
          See you, Jim.

     Lentz moves on. Kimble looks after him a beat, then focuses 
     on relocating the Woman he just saw. She's gone. He and 
     Nichols move together through the party.

                    NICHOLS
               (digs in his pocket)
          Before I forget, I went by the garage
          this afternoon and picket up the 
          Ferrari. Thanks for the loaner again.

     He hands Kimble a valet ticket.

                    KIMBLE
          They fix it this time?

                    NICHOLS
          We'll see.

     They reach the Woman Kimble saw, his wife, HELEN KIMBLE. 
     Kimble kisses her.

                    NICHOLS
          You look fabulous, Helen.

     He kisses Helen.

                    HELEN (WOMAN)
          Hello, Jim.

                    NICHOLS
               (to Kimble)
          We've got a court tomorrow at three.

     Nichols leaves. Kimble looks at his wife.

                    KIMBLE
          Well, I've seen everyone, can we 
          leave?

                    HELEN
          That would be a little abrupt, don't 
          you think?

     CUT TO:

     ANGLE - KIMBLE'S TABLE - NIGHT

     A table for ten. Kimble and Helen introduce themselves to 
     others at table ant sit across from each other.

     Kimble sits between two doctors' wives. One, NOW EAU WIFE, 
     mid-thirties, bedecked in jewels and loud dress, the other 
     OLDER WIFE.

     Helen sits between their husbands who are trying to impress 
     her with the details of their boring studies as CREDITS 
     CONTINUE...

     INTERCUTTING WITH the fashion, catches of dialog and course 
     changes, Kimble and Helen demonstrate an oft-used exchange 
     of glances: Kimble, while gracious to his dinner partners, 
     catches Helen's eye and makes smiling, subtle movements to 
     his watch or a look to the door to indicate he's clearly 
     ready to leave. On the receiving end, Helen, the gatekeeper 
     of their social propriety, indicates with equal subtlety: 
     "not yet."

     As we MOVE AROUND the table we hear:

     "Where's your husband on staff?" "My husband's an orthopod 
     at Northwestern." "I'm working on a new technique..." 
     "That's fascinating..." "That's quite a marvelous dress 
     you're wearing." "Do you like it? My husband says it's a 
     'four-fracture number."' "Honey." (A look from her husband.)

     Kimble shares a look with Helen. He subtly motions to his 
     watch: time go to, and mouths the word: "now." She shakes 
     her head.

                    NOW EAU WIFE
               (to table)
          I told my husband that he was going 
          to kill us if he didn't stop 
          operating. What with this AIDS thing, 
          he's putting us all at risk.

     Helen and Kimble absorb this comment without reaction, share 
     a look. Helen mouths the word: "Now."

                    HELEN
               (to her dinner partners)
          I'm sorry, I have to get my husband 
          home.

     They say their good-byes and pass Nichols' table. Nichols 
     shakes his friend's hand in passing. From across the room we 
     see Lentz watching.

     INT. KIMBLE'S MERCEDES - NIGHT

     Kimble and Helen driving home. She runs her fingers through 
     his hair as he drives.

                    HELEN
          You looked handsome tonight...

                    KIMBLE
          Thank you...

     He smiles to himself, seems to enjoy the compliment too much 
     for Helen. Her smile becomes playful, mischievous.

                    HELEN
          Uh, huh... most men in a tuxedo look 
          like waiters...

                    KIMBLE
          But me?

                    HELEN
          You looked more like... a band 
          director.

     He stops at red light, leans over and kisses her. Light 
     changes and neither notice. Slowly their kiss breaks.

                    HELEN
          Are we home yet?...

     CUT TO:

     EXT. KIMBLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Kimble pulls up in front of his house. Suddenly both his 
     PAGER and CAR PHONE RING at the same time.

                    KIMBLE
               (to phone)
          Dr. Kimble
               (suddenly attentive)
          When? Okay, tell them I'll be there 
          in ten minutes.

     He hangs up.

                    KIMBLE
          Tim's got a problem.

     Helen kisses him again, opens the door.

                    HELEN
          Call me on your way home.

     CREDITS END as we -

     CUT TO:

     INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - HALLWAY / SCRUB ROOM - NIGHT

     Kimble, wearing scrubs but without head gear, moves down 
     stairs to the OR hall.

     He sticks his head into the operating room.

                    KIMBLE
          Cavalry's here.

     Two harried surgeons look up, glad to see him.

     SCRUB ROOM

     Kimble begins scrubbing as the RESIDENT comes out to bring 
     him up to speed.

                    RESIDENT
          Patient is a male, forty-three. We 
          pulled his gall bladder and the 
          bleeding started.

                    KIMBLE
          What's his pro time?

                    RESIDENT
               (concerned)
          He's at 36 seconds. We got a major 
          bleeder in here.

                    KIMBLE
          You talk to the family?

                    RESIDENT
          None. He's off the street.

     CUT TO:


     INT. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO - OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

     Operation in progress. Top medical facility filled with 
     trained professionals and state of the art equipment. Kimble 
     is assisted across the table by the chief Resident. Both 
     working so intently they never look at each other as they 
     talk...

                    KIMBLE
               (to Anesthesiologist)
          Okay... I'm clamping. Can he 
          tolerate it?

                    ANESTHESIOLOGIST
          He's a very sick guy.

                    KIMBLE
          Do we have a choice?

                    ANESTHESIOLOGIST
          Go for it.

                    KIMBLE
          Marie, give me a clamp...

     MARIE, the scrub nurse, passes him the instrument and Kimble 
     and the other SURGEON continue to work with the Resident 
     assisting.

                    KIMBLE
               (never looking up)
          Your husband know you're here tonight,
          Marie?... What about this liver?

                    RESIDENT
          History's sketchy. Could be an 
          alcoholic.

                    KIMBLE
          Who referred him?

                    RESIDENT
          He's on a drug protocol. RDU90.

     Kimble looks up and shares a look with the chief Resident 
     over their masks, then back to work.

                    KIMBLE
          The wave of the future... Marie, you 
          told Frank yet? Frank is so jealous 
          of this late night thing we've got 
          going here... This should hold him. 
          Bleeding's stopped. Let's get a 
          biopsy...
               (to circulating nurse)
          Send it downstairs and make sure you 
          get Kath her slice.

                    SURGEON
          You staying for the closing, Rich?

     Kimble moves away and sheds his gloves and gown.

                    KIMBLE
          No. I got a date.

     INT. SCRUB ROOM - NIGHT

     Kimble throws away his hat and mask. The door opens behind 
     him; it is the other Surgeon.

                    SURGEON
          Hey, Richard...

     Kimble turns.

                    SURGEON
          Thanks.

     CUT TO:

     INT. KIMBLE'S CAR - NIGHT

     Kimble driving through empty Chicago streets toward home. 
     He is on phone, waits for answer.

                    KIMBLE
          Hi. I'm five minutes away...

     INTERCUT WITH:

     INT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

     Helen on the phone, downstairs. She is still in her gown with 
     an afghan around her shoulders. She's been reading.

                    HELEN
          I'm glad it went well. I'll see you 
          in a minute.

     Helen hangs up phone, turns out the light and starts up the 
     stairs.

     CUT TO:

     EXT. CHICAGO STREET - NIGHT

     Kimble driving.

     INT. KIMBLE-S TOWNHOUSE - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

     Helen moves down the hall toward the dressing room/closet.

     Opens the door to large closet dressing room and turns on 
     the light. Nothing. She starts to leave and decides to close 
     one of the interior closet doors.

     She starts to slide the door closed when - wham!

     A hand reaches out and clutches her by the neck. Helen 
     claws and scratches to get free and in her struggle her 
     string of pearls bursts...

     ... and a single pearl bounces out of the bedroom... rolls 
     across the landing to the stairs, stopping three steps from 
     the top.

     CUT TO:

     EXT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

     Snow swirls around the street as Kimble's car pulls into the 
     driveway. On the third floor, we see a bedroom light still 
     on.

     INT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

     A GRANDFATHER CLOCK TICKS softly. Kimble tosses his keys on 
     the entry table, picks up a stack of mail on the table and 
     calls up the stairs.

                    KIMBLE
          I'm home. Did you hear who won the 
          Bulls game?

     No answer. He steps into the:

     KITCHEN

     The wall phone shows a line in use. Kimble notices it. The 
     WASHER BUZZES, he switches the clothes from washer to dryer,
     and STARTS the MACHINE. Takes a bottle of wine and two 
     glassesand leaves the kitchen.

     INT. BEDROOM - CLOSE ON .38 SMITH AND WESSON - NIGHT

     Lies on the floor, beside Helen's legs and the receiver of 
     phone, off the hook. A man's rubber-gloved hand picks up the 
     gun.

     INTERCUT WITH:

     INT. DOWNSTAIRS - STAIRS - NIGHT

     Kimble starts up the stairs to the bedroom...

     INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Helen's hand reaches out presses the cradle down, dials

     ON KIMBLE

     Climbing the stairs... suddenly stops.

     A small white ball on the stairs. He bends down and picks 
     it up... a pearl.

                    KIMBLE
          Helen?

     Silence. He can see directly into the bedroom. It's quiet. 
     Too quiet. He notices a lampshade on the floor.

     UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT

     Kimble moves slowly to the opened doorway. And just before 
     he enters he sees a large form in the crack behind the door. 
     Adrenal surge.

     Kimble slams the door back on the figure knocking the gun 
     free. Before Kimble can move to it a forearm flattens him. 
     The attacker immediately goes for the gun. Kimble grabs a 
     leg and twists him down, the man's fingers hit the gun, 
     sending it skittering across the hardwood floor of the 
     landing and over the edge - three flights to the entry 
     hall below.

     SIRENS can be heard. Distant but APPROACHING.

     The man kicks free and tries to flee. This time Kimble 
     catches an arm and twists it at an unnatural angle. To his
     shock, the limb detaches between the shoulder and elbow.

     Kimble looks at the arm in his hands - it's hollow. 
     Electrodes are visible inside - then to the man's unreadable 
     face...

     The SIRENS are LOUDER...

     Before Kimble can recover, the One-Armed Man knocks Kimble 
     down and grabs back his arm. He runs down the stairs.

     Kimble pulls himself up and starts to follow but is stopped 
     by a VOICE behind him in the bedroom...

                    HELEN (O.S.)
          He's here... still in the house...

     INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Lying by the bed, Helen Kimble, clutches the phone with one 
     hand, her head with the other.

                    911 (V.O.)
          Did I hear you right? Your attacker 
          is still in the house? Ma'am?

                    HELEN
          He's trying to kill me...

     Kimble appears. Helen drops the phone when she sees him.

                    911 (V.O.)
          Will you repeat that please?

                    HELEN
               (to Kimble)
          Richard... He's trying to kill me... 
          my head.


     EXT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

     Two Chicago police cars wheel to the curb, COPS move quickly 
     to the house.

     INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Kimble moves to her. Sees the necklace of bruises where she 
     was held down and choked. And then a bullet wound in her 
     leg. She's already going into shock. Her speech turns thick.

                    KIMBLE
          Hang on, babe... going to be all 
          right.

     Her fingernails dig into Kimble's arm, trying to hold on.

                    HELEN
          My head. Richard my hold me.

     Her eyes slip away from his. He peels away the hand on her 
     head - and sees raw pummeled brain staring back and realizes 
     she won't be all right.

     CAMERA SWINGS DOWN TO the dropped phone.

                    911 (V.O.)
          ... Hello. You said his name is 
          Richard? Ma'am, can you talk to me? 
          Ma'am?

     CUT TO:

     INT. KIMBLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     The Cops enter the house. See the .38 lying on the floor. 
     Covering each other, they move quickly up the stairs - guns 
     drawn.

     ANGLE

     Third floor. The First Cop, gun drawn, turns the corner of

     Kimble holding his dead wife. Blood on his hands.

     INT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

     Kimble, numbed by the event, washes the blood off his hands 
     in the kitchen sink. A cop takes his blood-stained tux 
     jacket, and another hands him a parka.

     EXT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

     The street is filled with Chicago police cars, curious 
     neighbors, television news vans, etc.

     Kimble is helped into a police car as the coroner's van 
     arrives. He pauses a moment to watch as we hear.

                    DETECTIVE KELLY (V.O.)
          Can you give us a little more to go 
          on besides the fact that he had an 
          artificial arm? What kind of gun was
          it, Doc?

     INT. 11TH STREET DISTRICT HOUSE - NIGHT

     CAMERA FINDS Kimble in an interview room. He is in "why" 
     shock. "Why her." "Why me?" Says nothing. Two Detectives: 
     KELLY and ROSETTI. Kelly, the questioner, is overweight, 
     aggressive. He shifts his gun on his hip so he can sit down.

                    KIMBLE
          It was .38... I think. I only saw it 
          for a second. I knocked it out of 
          his hand.

     As Kimble is questioned we INTERCUT WITH flashes of the 
     murder scene being processed:

     FLASH - INT. KIMBLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Forensics technicians photograph the .38 at the base of the 
     stairs.

                    DETECTIVE ROSETTI (V.O.)
          Do you own a gun, Dr. Kimble?

                    KIMBLE
          Yes.

                    DETECTIVE ROSETTI (V.O.)
          What kind of gun?

                    KIMBLE
          A .38 Smith.

     PHONE RINGS. Rosetti answers it. Kimble watches him write 
     something down, he slides it to Kelly.

     DETECTIVE KELLY (V.O.)
     Your wife was loaded wasn't she? I mean, she was worth quite 
     a bit of money.

     BACK TO SCENE

     Kimble looks up at the two cops. For the first time he seems 
     to sense something aggressive in their questioning.

     They no longer seem on the same team.

                    KIMBLE
          What's going on here? This guy was 
          trying to rob us.

     The two cops stare at Kimble.

                    KIMBLE
          You guys have got to be out of your 
          minds. I didn't kill my wife!

     He gets up to go. A cop blocks his path. He turns and looks 
     at Kelly.

                    DETECTIVE KELLY
          Let's start over, Dr. Kimble. What'd 
          you have for breakfast?

     INT. 11TH ST. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

     Kimble in his tuxedo shirt and black tie holds a booking

                    MAN (V.O.)
          We're all adults here so I'll lay it
          out...

     EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY

     Chicago Sun-Times has a photograph of Kimble spread across

          thing perfectly clear.

     INT. ELECTRONICS SUPERSTORE - DAY

     Salesmen continue to hawk sets. Kimble's photograph comes 
     up on a hundred TV monitors across the store.

                    NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)
          Police are revealing no details in 
          the case against Chicago surgeon...

     INT. KIMBLE'S CELL - DAY

     Kimble lays on his bunk. Thinking...

     INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS - DAY

     CAMERA MOVES THROUGH smoke-fillet room to find tough FEMALE 
     PROSECUTOR, a man in late forties, WALTER GUTHERIE, and STOPS 
     ON the source of the voice we've been hearing and the cigar: 
     JUDGE BENNETT, late fifties. Fair but, no nonsense, political 
     survivor.

                    JUDGE BENNETT

     Walter Gutherie, his attorney, stands by a window looking 
     out at the yard. Another attorney, RANDOLPH, watches 
     Gutherie.

                    GUTHERIE
          ... We can't find this guy.

                    KIMBLE
          I know what I saw, Walter.

                    GUTHERIE
          I put you up on the stand to say what 
          you saw without anything that 
          remotely smells like proof and the 
          State's attorney is going to take 
          this one-armed man story and run it 
          up our ass.
               (he holds Kimble's look)
          Look, Richard, you're paying us a 
          lot of money to defend you... A plea
          to second degree -

                    KIMBLE

     On the other side of the door is the courtroom. A sheriff's 
     deputy hands Kimble (now wearing his suit), a small plastic 
     bag. In it we see his wedding band.

                    GUTHERIE (V.O.)
          It's a circumstantial case, but it's 
          also a jury trial. We play 'em, they 
          play 'em...

     INT. CHICAGO COURTROOM - DAY

     Richard Kimble sits at defense table... watches prosecutors

     KIBLE'S POV - THE JURY

     A few members lean over to make notes. It's powerful taken 
     out of context.

     NICHOLS ON THE STAND

                    PROSECUTOR
          Dr. Nichols. You are aware that 
          Richard Kimble was the only 
          beneficiary of Helen Kimble's estate.
          12 million dollars roughly.

                    NICHOLS
          I was aware of that. The money meant 
          nothing to him.

                    PROSECUTOR
          Yet in your presence, Richard Kimble 
          once said that 'if he had Helen's 
          money he could find plenty of uses.'
          Did he not?

                    NICHOLS
          We were talking about -

                    PROSECUTOR
          Yes or no?

                    CORONER
          The wound to the head caused a 
          massive hemorrhage to the brain. It 
          took from five to seven minutes for 
          her to die...

     A woman in the jury reacts. Kimble notices.

     KIMBLE

     On the stand. He finishes his moving description of the 
     events. We see some of the jury has been moved.

                    KIMBLE
          ... And I was holding her when the 
          officers came in.

     Gutherie returns to his seat. The Prosecutor moves to the 
     jury. He begins slowly but his questions pick up strength.

                    PROSECUTOR
          How tall was this man, Dr. Kimble?

                    KIMBLE
          I can't be sure. We were, mostly on 
          the floor, fighting... I couldn't -

                    PROSECUTOR
          Did that fight cause the scratches 
          on your face and arms?

                    KIMBLE
          No. As I explained -

                    PROSECUTOR
          And how did this man enter your 
          house?

                    KIMBLE
          I don't know -

                    PROSECUTOR
          And you probably don't know why your 
          wife told the emergency operator You 
          were her attacker?

                    KIMBLE
          She didn't -

                    PROSECUTOR
          Your name is Richard, isn't it? Your 
          gun is a .38, isn't it? Your prints 
          were on the gun, the bullets, the 
          lamp, her neck, weren't they?

                    KIMBLE

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     Richard Kimble sits behind the desk, but already he's a 
     shadow of the man we knew before, stares ahead passively as 
     Judge Bennett delivers the sentencing to hushed courtroom.

                    JUDGE BENNETT
          After careful and studied review of 
          all evidence presented during each 
          phase of this proceeding, and 
          because aggravated circumstances, 
          detailed at length, were present 
          the night of January 20th.

     Kimble is silent, stunned, but all around him the sentence 
     shockwaves through the courtroom. Reporters push out rear 
     doors. Prosecutors share a look - with a hangman's 
     satisfaction. Nichols, watching behind Kimble's table, 
     lowers his head. Disbelief.

     ANGLE ON RICHARD KIMBLE

     He remains silent. Kimble is pulled gently to his feet by 
     bailiff. Gutherie whispers an "I'm sorry." Kimble doesn't 
     hear it.

                    JUDGE BENNETT (V.O.)
          Therefore, it is the decision of 
          this court...

     Looks over his shoulder to the emptying courtroom. Faces 
     stare back.

     INT. KIT ROOM - DAY

     Judge Bennett's V.O. CONTINUES over:

     A locker opening. Inside, a profusion of chrome and nickel

     Slapped down over wrists, ratcheting down tight.

     Ankle cuffs dragged out. Pant legs raised, canvas shoes 
     exposed. Cuffs clamped down on ankles.

     CHAINS RATTLED out. Snaked across the floor. Looped around 
     waists and locked to handcuffs to form belly chains.

                    JUDGE BENNETT (V.O.)

     Main gates open. The BUS GRINDS onto the streets.

     INT. BUS - DAY

     The four prisoners sit scattered, still cuffed but no longer 
     chained together. Near the front, PRISONER #1 is eyeing...

     The two prison guards seated beyond the caged door. YOUNG 
     GUARD lighting a smoke. OLD GUARD drowsing. Shotguns 
     bouncing on their knees. Prisoner #l shifts his gaze to...

     The driver. Pistol on his hip.

     DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. DESOLATE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

     The BUS RUMBLES north, heading towards the horizon.

     INT. BUS - NIGHT

     PRISONER #1 rises. Through caging:

                    PRISONER #1
          Hey. Illinois penal regulations 
          require a meal for transport
          rides of four hours or more.

     Young Guard shakes his head. "Fucking jailhouse lawyers." 
     Checks his watch: 4:00.

                    YOUNG GUARD
          Jack! Feedin' time.

     Old Guard yawns to his feet, unhooks a key-ring from his 
     belt. Young Guard stows his shotgun in the weapons locker.

     PRISONER #2 looks at Kimble. Kimble stirs awake... watches 
     the cage door open, Young Guard moving back. And across the 
     aisle...

     PRISONER #3, a big man named COPELAND, wags his head 
     between his knees. Something slides out of his shirt and 
     CLANKS to the dimpled steel floor. It's a razor sharp 
     plastic shank.

     Heart quickening, Kimble looks forward. Young Guard is 
     handing a petrified sandwich to Prisoner #1. Kimble snaps 
     a look back to Copeland, who palms the shank.

                    COPELAND
          Breathe, and you're first.

     Old Guard watches from the open cage door, shotgun 
     carelessly ready.

     Young Guard reaches Kimble and extends a sandwich. Kimble 
     doesn't respond.

                    YOUNG GUARD
          Suit yourself.

     He offers the sandwich to Copeland. In the exchange, 
     sandwich drops. Copeland leans down for it.

     Up front, Old Guard yawns again just as...

                    KIMBLE
          Look out!

     Too late... Jackknifing up, Copeland drives the shank into 
     Young Guard's gut.

     Prisoner #2 dives for Young Guard's holster. As the gun comes 
     out, Young Guard gets a hand on it. A SHOT FIRES...

     Jolting Old Guard. He chambers his shotgun. Kimble hits the 
     floor. The Old Guard jams a key into the cage door and surges 
     inside, but...

     Prisoner #1 broadsides Old Guard. SHOTGUN DISCHARGES... 
     Opening a big Gainsburger hole in the driver. He sinks under
     the steering wheel. A knee hits the accelerator.

     The CAGE DOOR SLAMS locked behind the Old Guard.

     EXT. DESOLATE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

     As the bus careens off the road, accelerating.

     INT. BUS - NIGHT

     Young Guard wrestles gun from Prisoner #2 and FIRES, killing
     prisoner #2. Copeland grapples with wounded Young Guard.

     Old Guard shotgun-butts Prisoner #1, flips the gun, PUMPS 
     ONE ROUND into the man's chest. Dead. He turns just as...

     EXT. OPEN LAND - NIGHT

     As the driverless BUS BUCKS ant BANGS over open ground.

     INT. BUS - NIGHT

     Old Guard reloads. Copeland drops down behind a seat.

     Old Guard jams his SHOTGUN under the seat. But just as the 
     Old Guard pulls the trigger the bus jerks. The SHOT goes 
     off target as...

     EXT. OPEN LAND - NIGHT

     The BUS ROARS into a gravel embankment. ROARS up the slope
     and CRASHES down on its side - sliding to a stop at the 
     bottom of a small ravine.

     INT. BUS - NIGHT

     ENGINE DIES. Dusty silence. We don't know up from down.

     On his knees, Old Guard makes his way to the driver. Finds 
     him dead. Now a SOUND. Old Guard whips his shotgun around 
     at...

     Kimble. Rising between the seats.

     A hairy beat. Old Guard might kill him just to finish things 
     off. But a GROAN turns Old Guard's head.

     Young Guard, trying to hold his guts in. Old Guart turns to
     find Kimble.

                    OLD GUARD
               (to Kimble)
          You. You're a doctor. C'mere.

     He slides to the Young Guard as the Old Guard scrounges up a 
     medical kit, shoves Kimble down on Young Guard.

                    OLD GUARD
          Do something.

     Kimble looks at his cuffs. "In these?" Old Guard digs out 
     his key ring and unlocks Kimble's hands - only his hands. 
     Kimble opens medical kit. It's been ransacked - just 
     Band-Aids now. Kimble looks into the wound.

                    KIMBLE
          He isn't going to make it unless he 
          gets to a hospital. Fast.

                    OLD GUARD
          ZL.

     In this delicate moment a SHIVER runs through the bus. Is it 
     just settling?

     With other things to worry about, Kimble tries to stop Young 
     Guard's bleeding.

     ANGLE UNDER SEAT

     We see Copeland, alive. The crash has ripped the bars from a 
     back window and shattered the glass. He works to get out the 
     opening.

     BACK TO KIMBLE

     A second SHIVER ripples through the bus, stronger. Kimble 
     retracts his hands to touch a metal panel - and feels a 
     growing vibration.

                    KIMBLE
          Just where the hell are we?

     The Old Guard feels it too. He gets down on his knees and
     looks out one of the shattered, barred windows.

                    OLD GUARD
          Oh, shit...


     EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT

     The bus lies across railroad tracks. A not-too-distant bend
     grows bright by the light of an approaching train.

     INT. BUS - NIGHT

     Kimble sees: Old Guard fights the cage door. Kimble lunges 
     to his side.

                    KIMBLE
          It's locked. Where're your keys?

     EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT

     Downtrack, one Cyclops light appears.

     INT. BUS - NIGHT

     Kimble spots keys. Pitches them to Old Guard. Drags Young 
     Guard to the front for a quick exit. But Old Guard fumbles 
     the key-ring, his hands shaking as much as the bus.

     The train light spider-webs across cracked windows. Kimble 
     snatches the keys away from the Guard's trembling hands.

                    KIMBLE
          Which one? This? This one?!

     Old Guard gulps a nod. Kimble jams a key in the lock. Throws 
     the door open. Grabs Young Guard.

                    KIMBLE
          Help me get him -

     But Old Guard climbs right over Kimble's back and climbs out 
     the shattered windshield.

     ANGLE ON REAR OF BUS

     Copeland escapes through the hole in the back...

     EXT. BUS - NIGHT

     ... and hits the ground running the other way. The 
     locomotive's headlight reveals the toppled bus.

     INT. BUS - NIGHT

     Train light grows. A nanosecond of uncertainty: Should 
     Kimble leave the wounded man? Kimble and the Young Guard 
     hold a look.

     EXT. FREIGHT TRAIN - NIGHT

     As the WHEELS BRAKE and LOCK.

     EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT

     Kimble struggles out of the bus - pulling the Young Guard 
     behind him. He slings the man clear.

     SCREECHING death, the TRAIN SKIDS closer.

     For one heartbeat, Kimble remains perched atop the bus.

     The train light X-rays him.

     Kimble leaps. Lands. Rolls. Gains his feet. Tries to sprint 
     away but can't: His feet are still chained. He gets off a 
     dozen mincing steps before...

     IMPACT: A hundred tons of STEEL SLAMS into the bus, 
     splitting it open.

     Shrapnel rips through Kimble's thigh, but he stays on his 
     feet, still running feverish half-steps.

     An EXPLOSION envelops the train. Flames stream down its 
     flanks.

     The train burns past the wounded Guard.

     Kimble looks back, expecting to see the catastrophe behind 
     him. But he gets the shock of his life - of any man's life:

     Still on its wheels, the locomotive is derailing - and coming 
     after him. It's the stuff of nightmares: One little man being 
     chased by a fire-breathing locomotive.

     The train burrows to a stop.

     Kimble is suddenly five feet taller, standing on an upheaval
     of earth, staring eyeball-to-eyeball with the train that 
     nearly devoured him. He pants. Coughs on smoke. Then notices
     something in his hand.

     It's the key-ring.

     EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

     Kimble sits and searches the key-ring for manacle key. 
     Suddenly a hand reaches down and snatches the key-ring away.

                    COPELAND (O.S.)
          Give me that.

     Kimble watches as Copeland quickly unlocks both sets of his 
     own chains.

                    COPELAND
          You listen to me. I don't give a 
          damn which way you go, just don't 
          follow me.

     Kimble takes the key as Copeland wraps his chains around his 
     arm and runs. Kimble unlocks his leg irons and runs in the 
     other direction - crossing a hilltop in the moonlight.

     DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. CRASH SITE (SOUTHERN ILLINOIS) - NIGHT

     News and sheriff's department choppers circle billowing 
     smoke. TILT DOWN to reveal the derailed train. Fire engines 
     hose down the blackened locomotive. Rescue workers work 
     feverishly with jaws-of-life to get into the mangled 
     wreckage. Illuminated by spotlights, transportation 
     investigators in blue coveralls pick through the twisted 
     remains of the bus. State troopers restrain spectators.

     Two American-made rental cars pull up. Four deputy U.S. 
     marshals emerge:

     BIGGS. Swaggering Midwestern carnivore. Built like a brick 
     shithouse.

     RENFRO. Bantam-rooster of a man, no more than 140 pounds 
     fully-equipped.

     POOLE. Black woman. Nobody minds having her around during 
     nut-cuttin' time.

     NEWMAN, a scrub-faced G-5.

     From the second car steps GERARD. He takes in the media 
     spectacle.

                    GERARD
          Good lord...

                    REFRO
          What is this... a circus?

     As a group they begin moving along the service road above 
     the crash site. Derailed train cars are accortianed below 
     them. They take in the elements of the crash and as they 
     walk each begins to reveal their U.S. Marshal's credentials.

     Biggs spots something...

                    BIGGS
          Point of impact.

     ... and branches off.

                    GERARD
          Biggs, your turn to babysit Newman.

                    BIGGS
          Shit.
               (to Newman)
          Come on.

     They drop down to the crash site. Poole ant Renfro remain 
     with Gerard.

     A state TROOPER steps into their path, but falls away when he
     sees Gerard's Marshall star.

                    GERARD
          How ya doing? Who's in charge?

                    TROOPER
          Sheriff Rollins. Just follow the 
          lights -

     Gerard follows his point to where TV lights illuminate the 
     scene. He shakes his head - it doesn't please him.

     Renfro and Poole share a look, they seem to know what's 
     about to happen.

     ANGLE - OLD GUARD

     Seated near a tree. A space blanket draped over his 
     shoulders. He is surrounded by EMT personnel, and a YOUNG 
     SHERIFF, clearly basking in the event. Television remote 
     news crews are kept only slight back. Gerard appears in the 
     b.g., listening.

                    OLD GUARD
          ... train was bearin' down on us, 
          fast. I don't know how - it's still 
          kind of hazy - but I grabbed him
          and pushed him out of the bus.

                    SHERIFF
          You coulda both been killed.

                    OLD GUARD
          I know, but hell, he's my partner.
          Woulda done the same for me.

     The young Sheriff in charge nods, buying the story. Gerard 
     eases forward, displays his badge, interrupts.

                    GERARD
          Excuse me, Sheriff Rollins? Deputy 
          U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard.

                    SHERIFF
               (annoyed)
          I'll be with you in a minute.

     The television lights widen to illuminate Gerard. He shields
     his eyes. The Sheriff opens a file and produces fax-photos 
     of all four prisoners.

                    SHERIFF
               (to Old Guard)
          For the record. These three dead. 
          And this one...

     He switches to a photo of Kimble.

                    OLD GUARD
          Well, everything happened so fast...
               (bites lip, decides)
          Huh-uh. Don't think he made it.

     Sheriff eyes the wreckage that could entomb a hundred 
     prisoners, then files Kimble's fax-photo with the others.

                    SHERIFF
          You get some rest.

     He pats the Guard on the shoulder and approaches Gerard.

                    SHERIFF
          Looks like you came a long way for 
          nothing. My men've already done a 
          thorough search from point of 
          impact and found nothing.

     INTERCUT WITH:

     ANGLE - CULVERT

     Biggs and Newman stop by the muddy culvert. Biggs sees 
     something. He orders Newman into the muck after it.

     GERARD

     Aware of media, proceeds patiently with the young Sheriff.

                    GERARD
          With all due respect, may I suggest 
          check-points starting at a 15-mile 
          radius on I-57, I-24, Route 13 east 
          of -

                    SHERIFF
          Whoa, whoa, whoa... For what? 
          Prisoners are all dead. The only 
          thing check-points will do is get a 
          lot of good people out here frantic 
          and flood my office with calls.

     Gerard finally touches eyeballs with the young Sheriff and 
     we get our first taste of Gerard at close range.

                    GERARD
               (beat)
          Well, shit, Sheriff, I'd hate for 
          that to happen... So, I'll be 
          taking over the investigation.

                    SHERIFF
          On whose authority?

                    GERARD
          By authority of the Governor of the 
          State of Illinois and the office of
          the United States Marshal, 5th 
          District Northern Illinois...

     Poole produces State and Federal authorization documents 
     from one of her pockets and hands it to the young Sheriff.

                    SHERIFF
               (back-down beat)
          Okay. You want jurisdiction over 
          this mess, you got it.
               (to assistants)
          Shut it down. Wyatt Earp is here to
          mop up for us.

     He slaps the file of fax-photos at Gerard on his way out. 
     Just as Biggs, spotless, eases ino the group with Kimble's 
     manacles. Behind Biggs we see Newman, covered in mud.

     Seeing the leg irons, the Sheriff and his deputies pile to
     a stop. Now Gerard takes his run at Old Guard.

                    GERARD
          Please, ladies and gentlemen, step
          back and give this poor man some 
          room.

     Like an obedient dog the press backs off, they sense a 
     change of story and command.

     Gerard kneels down with Poole and Renfro in front of the 
     Old Guard. The Sheriff hovers near.

                    GERARD
               (friendly, to Old 
               Guard)
          Always an interesting thing when we 
          find leg irons and no legs in them 
          who held the keys, sir?

                    OLD GUARD
          Uh, me.

                    GERARD
          Would you be so kind as to show them
          to me, sir?

     Gerard's large hand extends palm up at the Old Guard.

     The Old Guard pats his pockets, comes up empty. He eyes the 
     press hovering just out of earshot.

                    GERARD
          Second chance.

     Poole reopens the file of photos in front of the man.

     The Old Guard can't take it - points to Kimble's photo.

                    OLD GUARD
               (cracking)
          He mighta got out.

                    GERARD
          Thank you.

                    SHERIFF
          What the hell is this? A minute ago 
          you tell me he's part of the 
          wreckage, now you're -

                    GERARD
          Renfro - Take that bus apart. I want 
          an accurate body count. Poole - Set 
          up operations right here.

     He stops and looks into the TV lights and starts moving 
     downtrack. The media and State Police move with him like 
     Israelites behind Moses.

                    GERARD
          Ladies and gentlemen... our 
          fugitive's been on the run for 
          ninety minutes. Average foot speed 
          over uneven ground - barring injury 
          is approximately four miles an hour, 
          giving us a radius of six miles. I 
          want a hard-target search of any 
          residence, gas station, farmhouse, 
          henhouse, doghouse and outhouse in 
          that area. Check-points go up at 
          15 miles.
               (to media)
          You got that? Good. Now, turn 
          those damn things off and get out 
          of our way.

     INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

     ROARS... just above the treetops. Helicopter speeds up a
     dark river. Its tracking beam illuminates the river bank.

     EXT. RURAL ROADS - NIGHT

     Flashing lights. Two highway patrol cars set up roadblocks. 
     The SQUAWK of police RADIOS breaks the rural quiet. A moment 
     later a HELICOPTER ROARS overhead.

     EXT. TRACKS - NIGHT

     Kimble moves down train tracks. His jumpsuit is wet with 
     blood from the gash. He pauses and checks the wound. He's 
     going to need stitches.

     Far down the tracks he sees glow of town lights. He keeps 
     moving.

     EXT. TRESTLE - DAWN

     Kimble crosses a tressel, keeps running toward the direction 
     of the lights.

     A junk yard by railroad tracks and a road. Signs along the 
     road show we're on the edge of town. One says: Hospital-1/2 
     mile.

     ANGLE - TRACKS AND STREAM

     Kimble runs from a streak up to the railroad tracks. As he 
     nears the junk yard and road he sees the hospital sign. 
     He's close but he can't go into the hospital in his prison 
     jumpsuit. He leans against a wrecked car and catches his 
     breath.

     Just then a tow truck pulling a car on its hook, turns off 
     the road and parks next to the tracks. Kimble ducks for 
     cover behind the wrecked car.

     The driver climbs out, dumps his coveralls in the front 
     seat and closes the door.

     He moves toward a house across the tracks, then forgets 
     something and returns to the cab. He throws open the door 
     and grabs lunch box off the seat - and we notice the 
     coveralls missing from the seat.

     As the driver returns to the house we MOVE TO the opposite
     side of the car to find Kimble, ducked beneath the window,
     clutching the coveralls.

     EXT. CRASH SITE - DAWN

     A crude headquarters is set up beneath a tent, near the 
     crash site. Maps are laid out on tables. Power and phone 
     lines are pulled down from the lines running along the 
     tracks. Renfro supervises the electronics.

     Poole handles phones, takes a report from the field and 
     relays it to Gerard.

                    POOLE
          Blood trail found. Two miles 
          southwest.

                    GERARD
               (to Biggs)
          Type it and match it against all 
          four prisoners.
               (to Renfro)
          Renfro, get an I.D. fax on Kimble to 
          every local hospital.
               (to Newman)
          Newman...

     Newman appears.

                    NEWMAN
          Yes, sir...

                    GERARD
          I need some coffee.

     As Newman steps off, everyone turns at sound of SHOUTING 
     from the train crash.

     ANGLE - TRAIN CRASH

     A RESCUE WORKER shouts up to others.

                    WORKER
          Hey, one's alive!

     EXT. RURAL HOSPITAL - LOADING DOCK - MORNING

     Loading dock outside the E.R. A WORKER stacks boxes of food 
     outside kitchen entrance. Kimble, in the tow truck 
     operator's coveralls, picks up a box and carries it inside. 
     Once inside he branches off down a hallway.

     INT. RURAL HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - MORNING

     A door opens on a long hallway. A DOCTOR, CHILD with a 
     bandaged hand, and a MOTHER leave a room and walk TOWARD us.
     Behind them, Kimble moves down the hall and stops in front 
     of the doorway.

     KIMBLE'S POV - MINOR PROCEDURES ROOM

     CUT TO:

     INT. RURAL HOSPITAL - MINOR PROCEDURES ROOM - MORNING

     Kimble closes the door and locks it. Hanging on the back of 
     the door we see a doctor's white coat.

     CUT TO:

     EXT. HOSPITAL - MORNING

     An Illinois State Trooper's car pulls up outside.

     CUT TO:

     CLOTH-COVERED INSTRUMENT TRAY

     On it we see: A packaged sterilized bandage, an opened 
     antiseptic wash, an opened topical anesthetic, and an empty 
     syringe. We PULL BACK to find:

     KIMBLE

     His wound bathed in orange antiseptic wash, three stitches 
     already in. With pair of forceps he picks up the needle as 
     he sutures himself.

     CUT TO:

     INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - LONG SHOT (MOS) - MORNING

     At far end of the hall we see a STATE TROPER chatting with a 
     DUTY NURSE at a nurses' station.

     CUT TO:

     INT. PROCEDURE'S ROOM - MORNING

     Kimble, his bandage already in place, gives himself a shot 
     of antibiotics.

     CUT TO:

     INT. HOSPITAL - MAN'S ROOM - DAY

     A man, tube in nose, on two I.V.s, lays in bed with eyes 
     closed. Kimble comes INTO FRAME near his face.

     KIMBLE
     Can you hear me, sir?

     No response. The man is out of it. Kimble backtracks to the 
     patient's closet and opens it. Hanging inside we see his 
     clothes. He removes them and notices the man's untouched 
     breakfast tray.

     CUT TO:

     INT. RURAL HOSPITAL - NURSES' DUTY STATION - DAY

     The Duty Nurse and State Trooper chat when a fax begins

     His arm slowly reaches out and presses his nurses call 
     button.

     CUT TO:

     INT. NURSES' STATION - DAY

     A fax photograph of Richard Kimble slowly comes off the 
     duty station FAX MACHINE. Next to the machine the 
     patient's call light comes on.

     The Duty Nurse, standing with the Highway Trooper, sees the 
     patient's light come on and starts down the hall toward the 
     patient's room.

     CUT TO:

     INT. PATIENT'S BATHROOM - DAY

     Kimble shaving when we hear the DUTY NURSE ENTER the 
     patient's room. He moves OUT OF FRAME.

                    DUTY NURSE (O.S.)
          Mr. Patterson, do you need some more 
          water?

     ANGLE - MAN'S EATEN BREAKFAST

     The Duty Nurse looks from the tray to the man, impressed.

                    DUTY NURSE
          ... Oh, you did a good job on this.

     She takes his empty plastic pitcher and...

     ... pushes open the bathroom door - no sign of Kimble - and 
     refills the pitcher from the sink.

                    DUTY NURSE
               (over her shoulder, 
               to patient)
          ... It does get dry in here, doesn't 
          it?

     She doesn't expect an answer, turns OFF the WATER, and goes 
     into the main room. As the door closes we see Kimble behind 
     it.

     CUT TO:

     INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

     Kimble, clean-shaven, and wearing the patient's glasses and 
     a doctor's white coat, moves down the hall to the emergency 
     room exit. Suddenly the State Trooper steps back from the 
     E.R. admissions desk with his newly received fax, and starts 
     down the corridor toward Kimble.

     The Trooper looks up as the two men pass...

                    TROOPER
          'Scuse me, Doc?...

     Kimble turns but continues slowly backing toward the E.R. 
     doors behind him.

                    TROOPER
          ... Don't know if you heard or not 
          but we're looking for an escaped 
          prisoner from that bus train wreck 
          'couple hours ago. Thought he might 
          show up here if he was hurt.

                    KIMBLE
          What's he look like?

     The Trooper looks down at his fact sheet as we see a slow 
     trickle of blood from a shaving nick begin winding down 
     Kimble's cheek.

                    TROOPER
               (from fax sheet)
          Approximately six one, 180 pounds, 
          brown hair, brown eyes and beard.

     At the last second Kimble feels the drop of blood and wipes 
     it clean as the Trooper looks up.

                    TROOPER
          ... Seen anyone that fits that 
          description?

                    KIMBLE
          Every time I look in the mirror ...
          but without the beard.

     They laugh.

                    KIMBLE
          Excuse me...

                    TROOPER
          Sure.

     Kimble moves through the E.R. doors as an ambulance parks 
     outside...

     EXT. RURAL HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM RAMP - DAY

     Two PARAMEDICS try to take out a patient on a gurney. The

     Kimble helps clear the wheels so the collapsible gurney 
     comes free.

                    PARAMEDIC #2
          Thanks, Doc, we had to dig him out 
          from under a train.

     As the gurney comes out, Kimble looks right into the face 
     of the Young Guard. The Guard's eyes suddenly open wide.

                    YOUNG GUARD
          It's him... It's -

     Kimble claps the portable oxygen mask back over the Young 
     Guard's mouth and keeps his hand there.

                    KIMBLE
          How is he?

     The Paramedics move him toward the ramp.

                    PARAMEDIC #1
          He's pretty bad off. Broken leg, 
          ribs. Concussion.

     As Kimble moves away...

                    KIMBLE
          Tell the E.R. doctor he's also got 
          a perforated spleen.

     He's gone... The two Paramedics share a look as they whisk 
     the Young Guard inside.

                    PARAMEDIC #2
               (impressed)
          Jesus, how could he tell that from 
          looking at his face?

     ANGLE - AMBULANCE

     Kimble climbs behind the wheel.

     EXT. TRAIN CRASH SITE / OPERATIONS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

     A full communications link is in place.

     Deputy marshals answer phones, work faxes, add information 
     to a situation board. Troopers bring in information. Poole 
     calls Gerard.

                    POOLE
          Background just came in from 
          Chicago.

                    GERARD
          Hit me.

     Renfro and Poole lay out the details. The download of 
     information comes clear and fast.

                    RENFRO
          Richard David Kimble. Vascular 
          Surgeon. Convicted of first-degree 
          murder in the killing of his wife. 
          Pleaded innocent. Claimed a 
          one-armed -

                    GERARD
          Let's not retry the case. Priors
          and accomplices?

     Gerard steps up the hillside out of sight of the 
     investigation to take a leak. Followed by Renfro and Poole.

                    RENFRO
          None. No previous arrests.

     Poole takes up a position discreetly behind tree as Gerard 
     unzips his fly and relieves himself.

                    GERARD
          Sealed juvie record?

     Poole calls out from behind tree.

                    POOLE
          Nothing. Total cherry.

                    GERARD
          Relatives? Children?

                    RENFRO
          No relatives.

                    POOLE
          One child. A son. Died in drowning 
          accident three years ago.

                    GERARD
          Girl friends? Ex-wives? Friends? 
          Combinations of the above?

                    POOLE
          Lot of friends. Doctors. Hospital 
          staff.

     Gerard zips up.

                    GERARD
          Start there. Authorize taps. Cover
          his lawyer first.

                    RENFRO
          Never get it.

                    GERARD
          Bet me.

     Renfro won't take it.

                    GERARD
          Have Stevens go to Judge Rubin, 
          he'll sign 'em.

     ... Biggs charges up the hillside.

                    BIGGS
          DeLange Hospital. Wounded guard 
          swears to High Holy he saw Kimble 
          right there in the hallway. 
          Ambulance, missing too.

     ANGLE - SITUATION TENT

     Gerard moves quickly to the map.

                    GERARD
          Give me a time.

                    BIGGS
          O-nine-thirty. Twenty minutes ago.

     Gerard redraws the circle of units. No longer are we 
     covering a fifty-mile radius. The circle is redrawn, 
     tightened, with the hospital as its center. The 
     triangulation is set.

     CUT TO:

     EXT. RURAL RAILROAD CROSSING - DAY

     The ambulance follows three cars toward a rural railroad 
     crossing.

                    COP (V.O.)
          ... We're waiting up here in Canton.
          Wondering if you heard anything on 
          this Kimble chase -

     INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

     Kimble behind the wheel as he approaches the railroad 
     crossing. The biocom monitors police chatter:

                    DISPATCHER (V.O.)
          Two-twelve-A, be advised that all 
          discussion on this matter is to be 
          conducted on a tactical frequency 
          - either Channel K or Z. Over.

     Frequency goes dead. Kimble looks THROUGH the windshield:

     ROAD SIGN

     An arrow points toward Canton, two miles.

     The cars in front slow as the railroad crossing signal 
     suddenly activates and the bars begin to drop. Kimble pops 
     the SIREN and hurriedly snakes through the crossing and 
     heads in the opposite direction... but his maneuver gets 
     attention.

     INT. TRUCK CAB - DAY

     Truck driver watches Kimble cut through the crossing and 
     reaches for his C.B. radio.

     EXT. CRASH SITE - DAY

     Poole hangs up phone.

                    POOLE
          Ambulance just spotted two miles 
          west of Doverville. Heading north 
          on State road 53.

     Renfro turns to the map and marks it. The circle is much 
     smaller.

                    RENFRO
          Running outta map, Sam.

     The crash site and hospital are already marked. Gerard is 
     ready to move.

                    GERARD
          Just the way we want it. Okay, 
          people, let's button up.

     They move off to waiting State Trooper cars and helicopter.

     INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

     Kimble driving down a rural road. He flips down visor and 
     eyeballs folded roadmap...

     EXT. SECONDARY ROAD (KENTUCKY) - DAY

     ... The ambulance crests a hill. In the distance we see the 
     Grosvner Viaduct and the Barkley Dam.

     EXT. HIGHWAY (KENTUCKY) - DAY

     Blowing other traffic off the road, WHOOPING CRUISERS and 
     G-cars stream south through the rugged rural terrain of 
     Southern Illinois. Overtaking them all, a CHOPPER THUNDERS 
     overhead.

     INT. HELICOPTER

     Heading into hilly terrain. Down below we see the ambulance. 
     Inside the helicopter Gerard eyes the terrain.

                    PILOT
               (into radio)
          We've got a visual...
               (to Gerard)
          He's heading toward the viaduct.

                    GERARD
          Seal it up.

     EXT. AERIAL VIEW OF GROSVNER VIADUCT - DAY

     The two-lane road disappears into long tunnel. Three hundred 
     feet below the road tumbles the Tennessee River.

     The Barkley Dam rises ahead. Kimble's AMBULANCE ROARS into 
     the tunnel.

     ON KIMBLE

     Suddenly sees the helicopter setting down ahead of him at 
     the mouth of the tunnel.

     Kimble slams on brakes and turns to retreat.

     ANGLE - FAR END OF TUNNEL (BEHIND HIM)

     Illinois Highway Patrol cars pull to a stop at the far 
     entrance. Light flares. Set out road blocks.

     ANGLE HELICOPTER

     Gerard steps out followed by Renfro and Poole.

     KIMBLE'S AMBULANCE

     Comes to a stop, blocking traffic in both directions. 
     Immediately HORNS begin BLARING.

     EXT. TUNNEL - NIGHT

     Trooper pulls up. Biggs and Newman behind Kimble blocking 
     the other end.

     Troopers with guns drawn block the exits. The P.A. from a 
     State patrol car blares:

                    P.A. (V.O.)
          Please remain in your vehicles and 
          lock your doors. Repeat, please 
          remain in -

     ANGLE ON HELICOPTER

     Poole and Renfro materialize already decked out in Kevlar. 
     They're jacked up and ready to rock. Renfro hands Gerard a 
     vest.

                    RENFRO
          Got him.

     Gerard unholsters a 40 caliber, Glock model 22.

                    GERARD
          Okay, ladies and gentlemen hard 
          part's over.

     He starts into the tunnel.

                    RENFRO
               (to radio)
          We're movin' in.

     INT. TUNNEL - DAY

     Weapons drawn, but held discreetly at their sides, three 
     silhouettes enter. Drivers who hadn't heeded the Troopers' 
     P.A. warnings take one look at Gerard and quickly climb 
     back inside and lock their doors.

     Biggs, Renfro and Poole fan out to the sides and give the 
     middle to Gerard. The tunnel is quickly quiet.

     Kimble huddles at mid-tunnel. He's trapped. Drops to the 
     ground beneath the truck. His heart pounding, brain 
     clicking, fighting panic. Suddenly he realizes he's in water.

     Running water.

     ON MARSHALS

     They reach the mid-tunnel area. No Kimble. Biggs looks 
     around, beneath vehicles. Gerard listens. Poole looks 
     confused.

                    POOLE
          Where'd he go?

     Gerard spots the trickle of water. He backtracks it until 
     he finds a loose grate in the pavement. Man-size.

                    GERARD
          Biggs, Renfro with me.

     INT. STORM DRAIN - FORKING CONDUIT - DAY

     Kimble splashes blindly through ankle-deep sluice. He slows 
     at forking tunnels to catch his breath and pick a direction. 
     A DULL ROAR comes from somewhere - from everywhere. He whips 
     off his jacket and slings it down a tunnel, then continues 
     straight ahead.

     Somewhere behind, lights probe splash-patterns on the conduit
     wall - telltale signs of Kimble's passing. The lights belong 
     to...

     Gerard, Biggs and Renfro. They push on, soon reaching the 
     forking tunnels. Renfro finds the jacket ant splash signs.

                    GERARD
          Channel Three.

     They conform their radios. Splitting up, Biggs and Renfro go 
     left. Gerard - straight ahead.

     INT. DOWNSLOPE CONDUIT - DAY

     Kimble. Bracing with all four limbs. Negotiating a mossy 
     downslope.

     INT. CONDUIT - DAY

     Biggs and Renfro. Sweeping his light as he advances. 
     Searching for splash-patterns.

                    BIGGS
               (into shoulder-mike)
          Nothing yet.

     INT. CONDUIT - DAY

     Gerard. Probing a branch-off tunnel with his light. About to 
     pass, he notices scrapings on the mossy walls of the 
     branch-off tunnel. Hand marks?

                    GERARD
               (into radio)
          Got a possible here. Stand by.

     He stows his light but hangs onto the Glock. Bracing with 
     three limbs

     INT. DOWNSLOPE CONDUIT - DAY

     Gerard begins the tricky descent. Slips once. Recovers. 
     Slips again...

     ... and tumbles out of control. GUN and RADIO CLATTER AWAY.

     Scrabbling for purchase, he finally snags An overhead pipe. 
     Gerard stabilizes. Sweeps his light to locate his Glock, 
     lying down-tunnel. He eases toward it. But another hand gets 
     there first.

     It's Kimble. Face dark and desperate. Dangerous. Hand 
     flexing on the pistol. They lock eyes for a beat.

                    KIMBLE
          I didn't kill my wife.

                    GERARD
          So, you didn't kill your wife.

     Not my problem.

     An adrenal beat. For a moment they hold a look. Then the 
     silence is broken by Gerard's radio.

                    BIGGS (V.O.)
          Gerard? You there?

     Gerard looks for his radio, then back at Kimble - he's gone.

     Instantly Gerard reaches for his ankle - and pulls a back-up 
     piece.

     INT. CONDUIT - DAY

     As Renfro hears FOOTSTEPS POUNDING his way.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     Gerard charges down the tunnel. From a side tunnel, Renfro 
     appears, almost colliding. Biggs follows...

                    GERARD
          Straight ahead!

     INT. CONDUIT - DAY

     Kimble sticks Gerard's gun into his waist band to balance 
     in the tunnel. He spills around a corner and stops. Ahead 
     lies an orb of light. The tunnel ends. The NOISE is 
     incredible. Kimble moves to the end of the tunnel and 
     stops.

     KIMBLE'S POV

     Water pours from the tunnel into the spillway of Barkley dam 
     disappearing into a veil of mist below - a great cauldron of 
     mists. No rocks. None visible at least.

     He hears the MARSHALS behind him - COMING CLOSER.

     ANGLE - MARSHALS

     Gerard and Renfro turn the corner. Renfro drops into a 
     shooting stance.

                    GERARD
          Turn around, hands over your head. 
          And get down on the ground.

     For a moment Kimble eyes Gerard.

                    GERARD
          Your choice, Kimble...

     Kimble turns his back on the Marshals, stares again at the 
     water. Slowly he puts his hands over his head. Gerard puts 
     up his gun and pulls his handcuffs. He moves through the 
     water toward Kimble.

                    GERARD
          Get down on your knees.

     Kimble bends slowly, stares down into the falls, hears the 
     footsteps get closer, then does the unthinkable. He jumps.

     EXT. BARKLEY DAM - DAY

     Biggs moving to the top of the massive dam sees Kimble leap 
     into the sheet of water spilling over dam and disappear into 
     the mists below. He can't believe his eyes.

     INT. DRAINAGE CONDUIT - DAY

     Renfro lowers his gun.

                    RENFRO
               (amazed)
          Son of a bitch...

     It's the most amazing thing he's ever seen...

     ON GERARD

     He stands at the mouth of the tunnel staring down. He 
     stares down into the mists. Impressed. It has told him 
     something invaluable about this fugitive.

     EXT. TOP OF DAM - DAY

     Gerard scrambles out of the tunnels to the top of the dam 
     near Biggs, just as squad cars, troopers and the search 
     helicopter converge on the site.

     EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

     Far downriver a figure fights through a snag in the bend.

     The snag - a tree branch - breaks away and heads down 
     stream. Hanging onto the branch we see Kimble.

     EXT. BARKLEY DAM - LOWER RESERVOIR - SUNSET

     Below the dam and spillway. Troopers in waders search the 
     shallows, deputies beat bushes along the shore.

     Farther out we see a dredge boat slowly working the waters.

     FROM SHORE

     Gerard watches the dredge cage come up again. As if with 
     the next pass it will prove him the victor. The HEAD 
     ILLINOIS TROOPER CAPTAIN approaches.

                    HEAD TROOPER
          Running out of daylight, Inspector.

                    GERARD
          Lights and generators are coming, 
          Captain.

                    HEAD TROOPER
          Look, I don't mean to tell you your 
          job, but maybe one person in a 
          million could've survived that fall.
          The guy's fish food.

     Gerard turns and brings his look to bear on the Captain.

                    GERARD
          Then find me the fish that ate him.

     He turns and heads to a waiting helicopter.

     EXT. WOODS - AFTERNOON

     Kimble runs through the woods. He staggers, his arm hooks a 
     sapling which spins him to the ground. He lays motionless, 
     exhausted.

     KIMBLE'S DREAM - INT. KIMBLE'S HOUSE - DAY

     ANGLE

     Helen in bed. Kimble's hand comes INTO FRAME and touches 
     her shoulder. She turns toward Kimble as he moves INTO 
     FRAME and kisses her.

     DISSOLVE TO:

     ANGLE

     Helen tosses her head back. She wears white silk pajamas

     DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. KIMBLE'S CAR - NIGHT

     Helen exiting Kimble's car the night of the murder. She 
     looks back at Kimble, framed by the door frame, ant smiles.

                    HELEN
          Good-bye. I love you.

     Again... Then again... then:

     HARD CUT TO:

     EXT. FOREST - MORNING

     Kimble comes out of his sleep with a start. Shivering. He 
     remembers where he is. His breathing returns to normal.

     EXT. TRESTLE - TUNNEL - MORNING

     Kimble moves across a river trestle and disappears into 
     tunnel.

     INT. DRUG STORE - DAY

     Kimble on pay phone in the rear of the store waits for 
     party 
     to answer. An old lady and her mother shop.

     Across the store a pharmacist watches Kimble.

     ANGLE - PHONE

     Kimbles watches the boys as he waits for answer. We hear 
     RINGING, then a receptionist answers:

                    RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
          The law offices of Gutherie, Morgan 
          and Wainwright.

                    KIMBLE
          Walter Gutherie please.

                    RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
          I'm sorry, Mr. Gutherie has left 
          for the day, would you like his 
          voice mail?

     Kimble hangs up and moves down an aisle, stopping in front 
     of the hair color. He takes a box of black hair dye off the 
     shelf and looks at the instructions. When he looks up he 
     sees the pharmacist looking at him.

     EXT. SONNY'S DINER - NIGHT

     A roadside diner. Kimble, his hair now black, and wearing a 
     new pair of Wranglers, hooded sweatshirt and a duffle coat, 
     moves down the road to the diner.

     INT. SONNY'S DINER - NIGHT

     Kimble enters. He sits at the counter and a sparky OLDER 
     WAITRESS, late, mid-forties, with strong good looks and 
     tough smile fills his coffee cup before he even asks.

                    OLDER WAITRESS
          Need to look at the menu?

                    KIMBLE
          Some soup, please.

                    OLDER WAITRESS
          Good choice.

     She marks her pad and leaves. Sights ant sounds around 
     Kimble begins to occupy his attention:

     A dishwasher buses a tub of dishes back to the kitchen. He 
     stares at him.

     A farmer sitting at a table stares at Kimble, Kimble looks 
     away. A man at the pay phone seems to be staring at him. Is 
     he calling the police? Everyone seems to be looking at him.

     Someone stops in front of him. A young waitress serves him 
     his soup. Where's the first waitress?

     Takes a few sips of soup. Out of the corner of his eye he 
     sees:

     The Older Waitress putting on her coat to leave. Is she 
     going to report him? He fights the paranoia.

     A NEWS REPORT on the TELEVISION gets his attention.

     ANGLE - TV

     A report on the escape. A television reporter describes the 
     chase for Kimble; his jump at the dam and his presumed death 
     from the fall.

     Kimble decides it's time to leave. He drops some money on 
     the counter and exits.

     EXT. DINER - NIGHT

     Kimble moves across the parking lot trying not to run until 
     he's out of sight of the diner. Once free of the lights of 
     the diner he starts running and disappears into the night.

     EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

     Kimble running down the road. Fields stretch out on both 
     sides of the highway. Open land. From behind him we suddenly 
     hear the sound of POLICE SIRENS. For a moment Kimble moves 
     faster, then as the SIRENS COME CLOSER, his sprint drops to 
     a jog... to a walk, until finally he stops and waits for the 
     inevitable... But the flashing lights suddenly rip past him 
     chasing a speeder. They weren't after him after all. Kimble 
     looks at himself. He's shaking.

     A moment later he is lit by headlights. A car pulls up next 
     to him, passenger window rolls down...

                    OLDER WAITRESS
          Need a ride?

     Kimble stares at her.

                    KIMBLE
          Which way are you going?

     She smiles and points in the direction her car is traveling. 
     They hold a look as we hear:

                    RENFRO (V.O.)
          We feel confident about the I.D.

     CUT TO:

     EXT. HOUSE - DAWN

     A quiet house on a quiet street out from town. A homeless 
     woman picks through garbage. A garbage truck moves slowly 
     down the street. A plumbing truck parked along a curb. Just 
     early morning traffic.

     We see Renfro and Newman watch the house from across the 
     street, behind a deserted house. Gerard joins them. We see 
     that Biggs is in the plumbing truck. Poole is the homeless 
     woman picking through the garbage. Newman hands Gerard a 
     radio.

                    RENFRO
          Local officials were about to wet 
          their pants to move in.

                    GERARD
          I bet they were.
               (to radio)
          Where's the woman?

     INTERCUT WITH:

     BIGGS

     In the plumbing truck. He triggers his mike.

                    RENFRO
               (into radio)
          Same room.

                    GERARD
               (into radio)
          Okay... I'll take front. Biggs and 
          Renfro, rear. Poole, handle support. 
          I don't want anyone hurt. Stay 
          outside unless called. Radios on 
          three.

     The deputies prepare their weapons. Newman checks his 
     service issue .38, stares at Gerard's Glock.

                    NEWMAN
          Uh, just want me to wait here, sir?

                    GERARD
          Hell, no. You're with me, Newman. 
          Let's go.

     EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - DAWN

     DOOR CRASHES open, splintering the deadbolt right out of 
     the door.

                    GERARD
          U.S. Marshals. Down! Down!

     INT. HOUSE - DAWN

     Textbook perfect, Gerard and Newman rush into front room.

     THEIR POV

     Down the hall a man's figure streaks across a doorway OUT 
     OF VIEW.

     A woman in the rear of the house BEGINS SCREAMING.

     GERARD

     Motions Newman to the left to check the door off the living 
     room while he moves down the main hall into the back 
     bedroom.

     ANGLE - LIVING ROOM / NEWMAN

     Clearly unnerved by the screaming woman, Newman opens door 
     off the living room. The door opens into a smaller bedroom. 
     He steps into -

     SMALLER BEDROOM

     It's empty. Gerard appears at the other (hallway) door to 
     the bedroom.

     HALLWAY

     Gerard motions Newman on to the door to the bathroom and 
     continues down the hall into the back bedroom where the 
     woman continues SCREAMING. He ignores her. His feet move 
     silently, heel-to-toe. He checks the bathroom as Newman 
     opens his connecting door - empty - then moves on toward 
     the doorway to the kitchen.

     Gerard moves to the kitchen doorway. Running out of house. 
     He braces himself swings into the kitchen - it too is empty.
     Suddenly Gerard gets the bad feeling he's passed his prey.

     CUT TO:

     SMALLER BEDROOM

     Newman looks around, suddenly scared. The only place he 
     didn't search was behind the bedroom door. He turns just as:

     COPELAND

     Surges out, knocks Newman's gun from his hand. In a flash, 
     Copeland yanks Newman's arm behind his back and presses a 
     knife against the deputy's neck and moves him out of the 
     room.

     We...

     INTERCUT WITH:

     GERARD

     He hears Copeland moving somewhere in the front of the house.

                    COPELAND (O.S.)
          I got your man! Now I want outta 
          here!

     Gerard moves back through the bedroom past the SCREAMING 
     woman. He locks in on the voice and sound of the moving 
     fugitive.

     ON COPELAND AND NEWMAN

     Copeland listens but gets no response from Gerard. He backs 
     through the second bedroom door, pulling Newman into the -

     LIVING ROOM

     Newman's eyes are pure terror - the blade pressed against 
     his throat.

                    COPELAND
               (to Gerard)
          You hear me? I said, I want out or 
          I'll cut your man's throat!

     GERARD

     Keeps moving down the hallway, through first bedroom, pauses 
     at door to the second bedroom and chooses his course.

     LIVING ROOM

     Copeland positions himself between the bedroom door and the 
     hallway opening. He's troubled he can't hear Gerard.

     Suddenly he hears a NOISE behind him at the bedroom door He 
     whips Newman around and we see:

     A shoe hits the floor. Copeland realizes his mistake too 
     late. He turns back to the hallway and there is Gerard.

     He never blinks. FIRES once killing Copeland instantly. 
     The knife falls to the floor. Newman clutches his head, 
     stunned but unhurt.

     Gerard now turns to the screaming woman behind him in the 
     bedroom doorway.

                    GERARD
          Shut up.

     She does. Immediately.

     EXT. HOUSE - MORNING

     As coroners and tactical police mop up. Gerard moves across 
     the yard, sips coffee from Styrofoam cup. He stops at a 
     sheriff's car, Newman sits on back seat, shaken, nearly 
     hysterical, clutching his ear.

                    NEWMAN
          My ear... I can't hear a thing out 
          of it. I can't believe you did that!

                    GERARD
          You think I should have bargained 
          with him, don't you?

                    NEWMAN
          Yes. You could've missed! You 
          could've killed me!

                    GERARD
          Yeah, you're absolutely right. I 
          could've.

     They hold a look.

                    GERARD
          How bad's your ear?

                    NEWMAN
          Terrible. I probably have permanent 
          hearing damage.

                    GERARD
          Let me see it.

     Newman leans toward him. Gerard speaks into his ear.

                    GERARD
          I don't bargain.

     Gerard leaves. Newman watches him - realizing what a truly 
     unsettling man Gerard is.

     EXT. CHICAGO PAY PHONE - MORNING

     Kimble makes call. While he waits for phone to be answered 
     TRAINS COME and GO in the b.g. An EL CROSSES OVERHEAD. The 
     BELLS of Chicago River DRAWBRIDGE.

                    KIMBLE
          Walter. It's Richard.

     INTERCUT WITH:

     INT. LAW OFFICES OF GUTHERIE, MORGAN AND WAINWRIGHT - DAY

     Walter Gutherie answers phone from his office overlooking 
     Lake Michigan.

                    GUTHERIE
          Richard... Jesus, why did you run? 
          Running only makes you look guilty.

                    KIMBLE
          I wasn't worrying about appearances, 
          Walter.
     
                    GUTHERIE
          Tell me where you are. I'll come
          meet you so you can turn yourself 
          in .

                    KIMBLE
          I'm not turning myself in. I need 
          money.

     Gutherie is silent. When he speaks again his speech takes on 
     the lawyerly tone of a man who's covering his own bases.

                    GUTHERIE
          Richard. You're asking me to harbor
          and aid a convicted felon... I can't
          help you that way. My advice - both 
          as a friend and as your legal counsel 
          - is for you to give yourself up. 
          Now tell me... where are you?

     Kimble picks up the change in his attorney's tone.

                    KIMBLE
               (beat)
          St. Louis.

                    GUTHERIE
          Give me an address. I'll be -

     CLICK. Gutherie hears the LINE GO DEAD. Kimble's gone.

     EXT. DOWNTOWN - DAY

     Kimble stands in the doorway with cup of coffee. He considers 
     his next move. Then seeing bank clock flash the time: 9:30 -
     he knows what that move is.

     INT. NORTH BANK TENNIS CLUB - DAY

     An upscale mid-town tennis club. Behind glass windows of 
     the entryway we see tennis courts. From the courts comes Dr. 
     Charles Nichols still dressed in his warmups, carrying his 
     tennis bag. A friendly DESK ATTENDANT Sharon) smiles as he 
     goes by.

                    DESK ATTENDANT
          See you tomorrow, Dr. Nichols?

                    NICHOLS
          Creature of habit, Sharon.

     EXT. NORTH BANK CLUB - DAY

     Dr. Nichols leaves the club. He tosses his gym bag into the 
     back of his car and drives off.

     INT. / EXT. NICHOLS'S CAR - DAY

     As he pulls up to the first stoplight, a homeless man moves 
     toward the driver's side and begins washing his windshield. 
     Nichols waves the man off.

                    NICHOLS
          Not today, please.

     The man shuffles off. Just then a second man appears at his 
     passenger window. He leans down to wave him away

                    NICHOLS
          No. Not -

     ... then stops - the face at his passenger window is 
     Richard Kimble's.

                    NICHOLS
               (stunned)
          Oh, my God... Richard...

     Nichols rolls down the passenger window.

                    KIMBLE
          How're you doing, Charlie?

                    NICHOLS
          You're alive...

                    KIMBLE
          Yeah. And I need your help.

                    NICHOLS
          Anything.

                    KIMBLE
          I need some money. Whatever you've 
          got on you.

                    NICHOLS
          Of course.
     
     Nichols reaches into his gym bag in the backseat and digs 
     for his wallet...

                    NICHOLS
          Tell me where you're staying. I'll 
          get you more money. Some clothes. 
          Just give me an address...

                    KIMBLE
          I'll call you.

     Kimble glances around, the area is still clear. He looks 
     back into the car and doesn't see the police car turn the 
     corner and come up the street behind them.

     Nichols finds his wallet ant hands all the cash he's got to 
     Kimble, who quickly pockets it.

                    NICHOLS
          I know why you came back - to find 
          him. If I can help, call me... 
          Call me.

     They hold a look. The stoplight changes to green but they 
     don't see it.

                    KIMBLE
          Thanks, Charlie...

                    NICHOLS
          Here, Richard, take my coat...

     He reaches into the back for his coat, suddenly police car 
     behind him POPS its SIREN. Nichols looks into his rearview 
     mirror. Sees a COP lean out his window.

                    COP
               (to Nichols)
          Hey, buddy - green light. Let's go.

     Nichols looks back at Kimble. He's gone.

     INT. U.S. MARSHAL'S OFFICES (CHICAGO) - CLOSE ON AUDIO TAPE - DAY

     REWINDING. The media room - just what it sounds like -
     banks of audio/video equipment and a sound board.

     Renfro rewinds the tape. Gerard, Biggs, Poole and Newman.

                    POOLE
          We've alerted St. Louis P.D

                    GERARD
          Call them back. Tell them you've 
          made a mistake.

                    POOLE
          What?

                    GERARD
               (to Renfro)
          Stop it there.

     Renfro hits play. Kimble's VOICE is heard again:

                    GERARD
          Drop the voices.

     Renfro removes the two voices. What comes up are the 
     BACKGROUND SOUNDS. EXTERIOR NOISES (BELLS RINGING, TRAFFIC, 
     MECHANICAL... TRAINS). Everyone becomes focused to the 
     sounds now.

                    GERARD
               (he's heard something)
          Listen.

                    BIGGS
          Trains? Traffic?

                    GERARD
          More... there's a voice in the 
          background.

     At first the sound is unrecognizable. A BELL. GRINDING 
     MECHANICAL. Then a P.A. VOICE on the tape: "Next stop 
     Merchandise Mart."

                    RENFRO
          That's an El announcement.

                    GERARD
          And there's no E1 in St. Louis. 
          Ladies and gentlemen, Richard Kimble
          is in Chicago. Poole, get his 
          artwork out to local police and have 
          C.P.D. check the shelters... Biggs, 
          bring in the detectives that handled 
          his case.

     Instantly the room is in movement.

                    STEVENS
          I'll prepare the press release.

                    GERARD
          No.

     Stevens stops.

                    GERARD
          They don't know he's alive and as 
          far as Kimble knows we don't either. 
          I want to keep it that way as long 
          as we can. Are we clear?

     The whole group sense Gerard's intensity in regard to 
     Kimble.

                    RENFRO
               (for the group)
          Perfectly.

     Gerard reflects on a moment of personal satisfaction.

                    GERARD
          Noah... go to my office and let's 
          officially take Dr. Kimble out of

                    FLYNN
          I ran his office for twelve years. 
          Yes, we were very close. But he 
          wouldn't come to me for help.

     INT. COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

     Busy with doctors, orderlies and street people. Kimble moves

     He moves into the room and takes a new patient form, looks 
     around. SEE BACK INTO the office area of the clinic. It 
     could be any hospital clinic from this view.

     But as Kimble turns to leave we see a PATIENT waiting to be 
     called. On his lap we see a prosthetic arm. Kimble looks up 
     from the arm to the man.

                    PATIENT
          Good morning.

                    KIMBLE

     INT. KIMBLE'S OLD HOUSE - DAY

     Gerard walks through Kimble's house. The art and most of 
     the furniture is gone. Books are in boxes and shopping 
     bags around the room. Plastic covers the remaining pieces 
     of furniture.

     Gerard stares at the empty walls. Shadows on the walls show 
     where the art once hung. Gerard pauses, tries to absorb the 
     place. He takes a book from one of the bags and looks at it.

     INT. COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL - JANITOR'S ROOM - DAY

     Kimble moves past the lockers, racks and boxes of cleaning 
     supplies, stops at a board listing work schedules, vacation

          Right... You ever been downwind of a 
          stockyard when the breeze is 
          blowing? That's where we were 
          sitting when Richard Kimble told that

     Kimble knocks at door. It is opened to reveal a PUNK KID,

     A light comes on and an OLD POLISH WOMAN, her stockings 
     rolled down her shins, leads the way down the basement 
     stairs. The Punk Kid stands at the top of the stairs, 
     watches Kimble.

                    ROSETTI (V.O.)
          We found nothing.

     The Polish woman shows him a spare but sufficient bed and 
     nightstand set up. She points to door leading up to the

     Kimble also at work at the bedside table. He carefully cuts 
     out his do-it-yourself photograph and places it over the 
     existing photograph on the hospital I.D. The name on the 
     I.D. says: Desmondo Jose Ruiz. Then he places a thin piece 
     of lamination plastic and trims the edges.

     Kimble defaces the plastic to give it rough look, then 
     examines the finished product not bad.

     Of medical residents. Two photographs next to each other. A
     young Richard Kimble and Charles Nichols.

                    NICHOLS (O.S.)
          Richard Kimble... I saw him two 
          days ago.

     WE PULL BACK to see: Gerard studying the photos. Renfro 
     looks up like someone's bitten him. He, Biggs and Gerard are 
     in Nichols' administrative office. Gleaming. Filled with 
     awards and photos of Nichols and influential people. Nichols
     hangs up his lab coat and slips back into his suitcoat. He 
     shows no sign of nervousness.

                    NICHOLS
          He stopped me in my car. I gave him 
          some money.

                    GERARD
          Where was this?

                    NICHOLS
          Outside our tennis -
               (correcting himself)
           - my tennis club.

     Gerard moves around Nichols' office taking in the details.

                    GERARD
          Did he ask you for help?

                    NICHOLS
          I volunteered. He wouldn't accept 
          it.

                    GERARD
          Why do you think he came back to 
          Chicago?

                    NICHOLS
          He didn't tell me.

                    GERARD
          I didn't ask you that, sir. I'm sure
          he was trying to protect you from 
          having to lie for him.

     Gerard continues to move around the room, study prints, 
     books, drawings, awards and photos.

                    GERARD
          If you're really his friend, you'll 
          help us bring him in unharmed.

                    NICHOLS
          Why, so he can go back to prison? 
          If you want help, gentlemen, you've 
          come to the wrong man.

     Gerard finds a photo of Nichols and a gleaming Ferrari.

                    GERARD
          Dr. Nichols, last year the U.S. 
          Marshals' office closed out 11,003 
          warrants... 10,975 of those were 
          captured. The twenty-eight others 
          thought they were smarter than 
          us... Now they're dead.

          Nice car.

     Gerard puts the photo down.

     Gerard and his deputies leave Nichols' outer office. 
     Gerard clearly feels he's come to the right man.

     INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Kimble mopping the trauma room hallway. The hallway elbows 
     around a corner and Kimble stands less than ten feet from 
     a door that is marked: "PROSTHETIC CLINIC"

     He watches a technician leave the clinic and mops closer to 
     the doorway, and fails to see an attractive WOMAN DOCTOR 
     with white coat and stethoscope draped around her neck turn 
     the corner behind him ant step on the freshly mopped 
     section.

     Head down, she is completely absorbed in a file and doesn't
     see the wet floor until she slips slightly, looks up but 
     keeps walking.

                    WOMAN DOCTOR
          Where's Rudy?

                    KIMBLE
          They said he's sick.

                    WOMAN DOCTOR
          Didn't they tell you to put up the 
          sign?

                    KIMBLE
          Uhhh. No they didn't.

                    WOMAN DOCTOR
          Put up the 'wet floor' sign before 
          someone gets hurt.

     She keeps going.

                    KIMBLE
               (mumbles)
          Asshole.

     She looks back at Kimble.

                    WOMAN DOCTOR
          What did you say?

                    KIMBLE
          Nothing.

     Anne keeps moving off toward trauma hall. He watches her 
     turn the corner to the trauma hallway.

     INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - NIGHT

     Kimble enters the dimly lit prosthetics lab.

     He moves silently among the casts and prosthetics of arms, 
     hands, legs hanging from the ceiling. Cables and electronic 
     equipment are on the counters.

     He leaves the lab and moves into the office section of the 
     Prosthetic Clinic. He passes a computer room and finally 
     reaches the office. He is about to enter when a woman's 
     voice stops him.

                    WOMAN (O.S.)
          Hey, Ricky... Weren't you just in 
          here?

     Kimble turns to see a PROSTHETIC TECHNICIAN. A large woman 
     with glasses. She stands with a partially finished 
     prosthetic arm.

               (stumbling)
          No... I've got to clean the blinds
          in the office. Want me to wait till 
          you're finished?

                    TECHNICIAN
          Naw... I'm going to be here all 
          night. You won't bother me.

     She slips on a pair of headphones and goes back to work.

     Photographs of prosthetic arms. Kimble shifts the materials
     into his clothes, closes his coat and suddenly he stops.

     INT. HALLWAY - ANGLE ON ELEVATOR - NIGHT

     Kimble waits for the elevator. The folders in his uniform 
     shift and he tries to rearrange them. When he turns back 
     we see Anne Eastman beside him. Her I.D. says: 
     "ANNE EASTMAN". She sees him doing the rearranging.

     The elevator arrives. They step into:

     INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

     Anne moves to the back. Kimble on the other side.

                    ANNE (WOMAN DOCTOR)
          Hey, how're you doing?

                    KIMBLE
          Fine.

                    ANNE
          You find that sign?

                    KIMBLE
          Yes, I did.

                    ANNE
          You called me an asshole.

                    KIMBLE
          Excuse me. I was having a bad 
          shift.

     They laugh. They reach ground level and step out together.

                    ANNE
          You worked at other hospitals?

                    KIMBLE
          Lots of them over the years. Here, 
          long ago. Hasn't changed much.

                    ANNE
          I bet it hasn't. See you.

     They part ways. Kimble continues out the door. Anne stops 
     and watches him leave.

     INT. EL TRAIN - NIGHT

     Kimble sits on the night train going home. He begins looking 
     at his information.

     INT. KIMBLE'S BASEMENT ROOM - DAY

     Afternoon light comes in Kimble's basement windows. Sheets 
     of Prosthetic Clinic patient material are spread over 
     Kimble's bed, floor. Kimble searches through the documents, 
     making notes. He studies photos of attachments. Cable 
     attachments. Joints. Electronics. Pins. straps... looking 
     for a key to the identity of the one-armed man.

     Finally he stops. He finds the flyer in his pocket, puts it 
     on the bedside table and moves to sink. He wets a towel and
     covers his face.

     Draws a cool damp breath. Lays back on bed amid the 
     Prosthetic Clinic material.

     FLASHBACK - FIGHT

     Kimble pulls the arm. It separates in the one-armed man's 
     sleeve. Wrenches. Dis-articulates.

     FLASHBACK - ONE-ARMED MAN

     Reacts in pain. Again. (NOTE: We sense Kimble's mind 
     returning to something. Getting closer to the key...)

     FLASHBACK - ONE-ARMED MAN

     Escaping the bedroom. We hear his FOOTSTEPS DOWN the 
     STAIRS... a DOOR SLAM. FOOTSTEPS again.

     Another DOOR SLAMS, but this time the sound is distinctly 
     different... a CAR DOOR.

     INT. KIMBLE'S BASEMENT ROOM (BACK TO PRESENT)

     Kimble yanks the wet rag from his face, his senses alert. 
     Listening, he hears: FOOTSTEPS are real, just outside and 
     MOVING TOWARD him.

     HARD CUT TO:

     EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY

     A car door slams. We see unmarked police cars pulling up in 
     front of the apartment. Cops are moving toward the house.

     Kimble turns off his light, moves from the bed to the window. 
     Carefully looks out:

     KIMBLE'S POV

     Unmarked police cars in front of the house, looking, moving 
     his way.

     BACK TO SCENE

     Kimble moves instinctively to the back door.

     He starts to open it but through the dirty window, he sees 
     the back courtyard covered by more cops.

     Kimble moves back toward the front. Unsure of his next move, 
     he's sweating, preparing for the worst.

     He watches the TAC team charge the house but instead of 
     charging through the basement door they move up the front 
     steps and into the house overhead.

     Overhead he hears the SCREAMING from the arresting cops.

     KIMBLE'S POV - BACK STEPS

     Kimble SEES the Punk Kid try to escape out the back. He 
     runs, sees cops and runs toward Kimble's basement door, 
     actually reaching it before he is caught by the cops and
     pulled away.

     KIMBLE

     Moves toward the front window and watches cops lead the 
     Punk Kid out to the car.

     POLICE RADIOS call the other cops to stand down.

     Kimble moves slowly to his front door. Looks out.

     KIMBLE'S POV

     Cops put the young man into an unmarked police car. His 
     grandmother, the Polish woman, follows them, crying.

     BACK TO SCENE

     Kimble leans against the wall, exhausted.

     INT. COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL - TRAUMA HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Kimble carries his cleaning tray down busy hallway just 
     outside of the Prosthetic Clinic and stops.

     KIMBLE'S POV

     Two cops talk outside the Prosthetic Clinic.

     Kimble backs to a safe place in the trauma hallway to wait 
     for them to leave.

     A wanted poster of Kimble over the cop's head.

     BACK TO SCENE

     The Kid sees - Wanted for Murder - realizes who it is.

                    PUNK KID
               (to cop)
          Hey. Hey! I know that guy!

     The cop looks up, sees Kimble's poster and then back at the 
     Kid.

     CUT TO:

     INT. TRAUMA HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Kimble moves toward prosthetic clinic. In passing through 
     the trauma hallway he becomes aware of a crisis developing. 
     A major accident has happened, victims are being brought in.

     The P.A. CALLS for doctors. STATIC.

     ANGLE ON FAR END OF TRAUMA HALLWAY

     Elevator doors open as orderlies bring in new patients. 
     Some walk, some are helped by family and police. Nurses 
     direct traffic.

     Orders fly. Medicines are called. Family members yell for 
     doctors. Ask for the injured. Anne picks up the pace with 
     an ORDERLY wheeling a gurney carrying a young patient, 
     a BOY.

                    ANNE
          What happened?

                    ORDERLY
          A bus flipped off the overpass. Got
          at least twenty more coming in.

                    ANNE
          What about this one here?

                    ORDERLY
          Fractured sternum. X-ray's coming 
          up.

     Anne checks the boy's chart.

                    ANNE
          Okay, we've got to get some room
          in this hallway, people.

     Orderlies quickly move the non-life-threatening patients out
     of the hall. Still more help is needed. Anne spots Kimble.

                    ANNE
          Hey, take this one up the hall to
          Critical Care.

     Kimble nods. Anne moves to another patient.

     Kimble grabs the kid's gurney and begins wheeling it up the 
     hall. As he pushes he looks at the kid's X-rays.

     Anne looks up, barks another order, then suddenly sees Kimble 
     pushing the gurney and looking at the film.

     ANNE

     Tries to negotiate through the incoming patients to get a 
     better look, but Kimble is gone. She goes back to work.

     ON KIMBLE

     He wheels the Boy's gurney into an elevator. The doors 
     close.

     INT. HOSPITAL - O.R. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

     Kimble wheels the gurney down the hall and stops the Boy 
     on the scrub threshold to the O.R. and stops a SURGEON.

                    KIMBLE
          Hey. Hey!

     A Surgeon pauses and eyes Kimble's janitor suit and the 
     gurney.

                    KIMBLE
          They just sent this one up.

     He takes a look at the Boy's chart and grabs the X-rays and 
     yells to O.R. nurse.

                    SURGEON
          Bob! Get this one into room four, 
          stat.

     He looks up, Kimble is gone.

     INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

     Kimble enters the Prosthetic Clinic computer room. The 
     Technician from the day before is listening to her Walkman,
     sees Kimble and waves. Kimble waves back and turns into the 
     glass-walled computer room and closes the door.

     He closes the blinds and turns on the computer.

     INT. CRITICAL CARE UNIT - NIGHT

     The crisis has wound down. Anne moves into the room and

          Gladys, where's the boy I sent down 
          with the janitor?

                    GLADYS
          What boy?

                    ANNE
          The one with the fractured sternum.

                    GLADYS
          He never came in here.

     INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

     Kimble scans DOS files, each an eight-letter enigma. Finds 
     one with promise and loads it up.

                    KIMBLE
          Wrong...

     He backs up and tries another file.

     "CLIENT DEMOGRAPHIC ORGANIZER SEARCH BY: AGE, SEX, RACE, 
     LIMB, OR OTHER?"

     Kimble knows he's got it.

     INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - COMPUTER ROOM - CLOSE ON SCREEN - NIGHT

     Kimble keys in these responses:

     Anne comes out of the stairwell and stops the Surgeon we 
     saw with Kimble.

                    ANNE
          Dave, did you see a janitor come up 
          here earlier?

                    SURGEON
          Yeah, he brought a kid up.
               (handing her the chart)
          Anne, did you write the orders? I 
          couldn't make out the signature...

                    ANNE
          I saw -

                    SURGEON
               (in a hurry now)
          Whoever did knew what the hell he 
          was doing. Kid's a hair away from 
          a ruptured aorta.

     He heads to the operating room, leaving her stunned. She 
     stares at the scrawled orders.

     CUT TO:

     INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - COMPUTER ROOM - CLOSE ON SCREEN - NIGHT

     A "PLEASE WAIT" message appears on the screen. We hear the

     DO YOU WISH TO SUBDIVIDE?"

                    KIMBLE
          Seventy-five. Hell, yes.

     Kimble types in another defining characteristic... 
     Residence: Illinois.

     Again he waits. Rattles the blinds to make it seem like he's 
     cleaning. The list shortens.

     Joint repair list between January 21-April 21... Five names 
     come up with Greater Chicago addresses.

     Kimble hits print. The MACHINE begins PRINTING. Kimble 
     looks up at the Prosthetic Clinic Technician - she is 
     listening to her headphones, can't hear the printer. He 
     continues to shake the blinds.

     EXT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC/TRAUMA HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Kimble leaves Prosthetic Clinic and starts down the hall 
     for the exit when a voice stops him.

                    ANNE (O.S.)
          Do you have a particular interest in
          our patients' x-rays?

     Kimble turns to see Anne coming toward him.

                    KIMBLE
          What do you mean?

                    ANNE
          I saw you looking at that boy's 
          chest film.

     She moves in on him. He eyes the exit.

                    KIMBLE
          It's a hobby of mine -

                    ANNE
          What other hobbies do you have? 
          Brain surgery?

                    KIMBLE
     What do you want?

     She reaches him.

                    ANNE
          I want to know how that kid ended 
          up in surgery.

                    KIMBLE
          I'm a janitor. I did what I was 
          told.

                    ANNE
          Bullshit. Who changed those orders?

     They hold a look. She knows. He takes a step back and she 
     pulls his I.D.

                    ANNE
          You stand right here. I'm calling 
          security.

     Kimble runs. Anne turns to call security but doesn't.

     She stares after Kimble.

     INT. COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL - CLOSE ON KIMBLE'S I.D. - DAY

     Anne and Gerard stand in the hallway. Gerard studies the I.D.

                    GERARD
          A man posing as a janitor orders an 
          emergency operation and all you do 
          is pull his I.D.?

                    ANNE
               (firmly)
          A little boy's alive today because 
          he did something.

     Gerard watches her eyes carefully.

                    GERARD
          So, you weren't aware that when he 
          escaped he was being transported to 
          Menard State Prison to begin a term 
          of life imprisonment.

                    ANNE
          For what?

                    GERARD
          For murdering his wife.

     Clearly this is news to Anne. Gerard almost smiles at her 
     surprise.

                    GERARD
          Thank you for your help, Doctor.

     He moves to the position Anne saw Kimble with the kid's 
     gurney. Trying to imagine what Kimble was doing at that 
     place. Renfro and the other deputies converge.

                    RENFRO
          What I can't figure is, if you were 
          Kimble, why'd you take a major 
          league chance of hanging around a 
          trauma ward?

     Gerard considers this as a Man passes him. Gerard notices 
     something.

                    RENFRO
          The place would be crawling with cops.

     Slowly Gerard separates from the group of deputies and 
     follows the Man down the hall.

     The Man Gerard is following turns the corner to the 
     Prosthetic hallway and realizing Gerard is following him, 
     holds the hallway door open for Gerard.

                    MAN
          Can I help you find something?

                    GERARD
          Thank you, sir, I think you already 
          have.

     We see the Man has a prosthetic arm and that they are outside 
     the door marked: "PROSTHETIC CLINIC"

     Kimble stands on a sidewalk, staring at the imposing edifice

     through traffic.

     INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - LOBBY - DAY

     Kimble waits for an elevator. It opens to reveal a pack of 
     staring COPS.

                    ELEVATOR COP
               (catching door)
          Comin' or not?

     Forcing his feet to move, Kimble boards...

     INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - ELEVATOR - DAY

     ... and pivots quickly. Elevator rises. Floor-indicator moves 
     deathly slow.

     Kimble feels the breath of a dozen COPS on his neck. And just 
     when his floor is mercifully about to arrive...

     Overhead lights flicker, and the elevator jars to a stop 
     between floors.

                    COPS
          Aw, shit... Not now... Anybody 
          bring a deck of cards?

     Abruptly they're moving again. Kimble's heart restarts with 
     the elevator.

     Gerard looks at Biggs as they reach the elevators.

     one-armed man, DRISCOLL, who waits there.

          Shit, that's okay. Stick around a

     Kimble exits the visitor's area. He sees another crowd of 
     COPS around the elevator again, opts for the door marked: 
     "STAIRS"

     INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - LOBBY - DAY

     Biggs and Gerard wait for the elevator. Finally Gerard's 
     had enough.

          Where're the damn stairs?

                    BIGGS
          It's five flights!

          Then you wait.

     He finds the door and starts up.

     INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - STAIRWELL - DAY

     Kimble descending. Doors open and close throughout the 
     stairwell but the traffic is light...

     INTERCUT WITH:

     GERARD

     Climbing the stairs. He reaches a landing - and skims 
     shoulders with Kimble, who pivots past on his way down.

     Amazingly, neither man reacts. Not yet.

     One flight above, Gerard's subconscious taps him on the 
     shoulder and brings him to a dead stop. He leans over the 
     stairwell railing to spy...

     Kimble spiraling downward. From this vantage, it could be 
     any dark-haired man. But still...

                    GERARD
          (a quick probe)
          Kimble.

     Others look up out of curiosity... but not Kimble. Two 
     landings below, he falters a step, then tries to regain 
     his step, keeps moving.

     But Gerard is pulling his Glock: The hitch in Kimble's 
     stride told him everything.

                    GERARD
          Kimble!

     Kimble blitzes down the stairs. Gerard moves after him.

     INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - LOBBY - DAY

     Kimble throws open a fire door and starts across the lobby. 
     Sees two cops, quickly approaches.

                    KIMBLE
          Officers - there's a man in the 
          stairwell waving a gun and 
          screaming.

     The two cops rush to stairs and Kimble immediately moves
     toward the doors, fast but not running. Hoping to cloak 
     himself in civilians.

     ANGLE ON ELEVATORS

     Biggs' elevator has finally arrived and emptied. He lets a 
     woman on in front of him, oblivious to...

     Kimble moving...

     The revolving exit doors loom nearer ant nearer.

     INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

     The two cops see Gerard. Gerard holds up his badge.

                    GERARD
          U.S. Marshal! Get on the phone, call
          your commander, tell him there's a 
          top-fifteen warrant in the building. 
          Go.

     He shoves the cops out of the way and pounds downstairs.

     INT. LOBBY - DAY

     Kimble closing in on the door when suddenly a KLAXON HORN 
     sounds.

     People stop in confusion. Automatically, the exit doors 
     begin closing. Biggs pushes his way off the elevator. 
     Kimble breaks into a sprint for the door.

     GERARD

     Bursts out the stairwell door after Kimble.

                    GERARD
          Kimble. Stop!

     But there's only one way of stopping Kimble.

     KIMBLE

     Enters the revolving doors as a big man enters from the 
     outside. The big man sizes up the situation, realizes Kimble 
     is fleeing and just before Kimble exits - yanks on the door 
     - trapping him partially inside the revolving door.

     Other doors seal electronically. Biggs charges back, sees 
     Gerard.

     Kimble fights the heavy glass door. The big man resists - 
     but slowly the crack widens. Gerard bulls through the crowd,
     shoves a man out of his line of fire.

                    GERARD
          Down. down. everybody down!

     With adrenal effort, Kimble wrings his body through the 
     opening...

     EXT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - DAY

     ... and makes it outside - except for his foot - caught like 
     in a bear trap, as the door locks down. Harrowed, Kimble looks
     back over his shoulder at...

     Gerard. Charging the glass doors. Civilians suck marble and 
     clear out of Gerard's line of fire on Kimble. Gerard takes aim.

                    GERARD
          Kimble. Stop!

     It's Kimble's nightmare coming true. If he could chew off his 
     leg right now, he would. He pulls at his foot just as

     INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - DAY

     Gerard FIRES seven times in two seconds.

     Kimble goes down. SHOTS and SCREAMS ECHO around the lobby. A 
     long beat, then Gerard rises. THROUGH GLASS studded with 
     bullet holes, he sees...

     Kimble rising... staring back. Equally astounded that he's 
     alive. He runs free.

                    GERARD
          Open the doors!

     Gerard pounds against the doors. Sees cratering in the 
     glass - and then sees flattened slugs all over the floor. 
     It's bullet-proof glass. THROUGH the glass he sees Kimble 
     rush across the street and disappear into the parade.

     Doors open and Gerard and his men follow.

     But Kimble has disappeared into the parade celebrations 
     outside. Blending in with the marchers.

     Kimble leaves a cheap hotel early the next morning. He wears

     The PHONE RINGS nine, ten times. As Kimble waits he looks 
     down at his list of five. The only name remaining is 
     Fredrick Sykes.

     He looks down the street - it seems clear - then his focus 
     shifts to a man carrying two coffees. He approaches a car 
     parked along the curb. The passenger - a woman - leans 
     across the seat and opens the door for him.

     He hands her a cup of coffee and as he starts to climb in, 
     he shifts something on his hip - we see the butt of a 
     handgun.

     Kimble hangs up and leaves through the back door.

     EXT. REAR OF SYKES' APARTMENT - MORNING

     Kimble moves across the roof and drops to fire escape behind 
     Sykes' apartment. He looks in the window, steps back to see 
     if anyone is looking, then pulls his fist back into his 
     sleeve and with one swift pop, BREAKS the GLASS.

     INT. SYKES' APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MORNING

     No sound. Slowly he moves into...

     HALLWAY

     Moving first toward the living room. The apartment is 
     modest.

     He stops by a photograph of a teenage girl. Another is a 
     boy in football uniform. The next one is a man in a 
     police uniform. Kimble freezes.

     possibility - that the murder wasn't just a random act of

          He's on the southside.

                    GERARD
          That's right, Kimble... I'm not 
          trying to solve a puzzle here. I'm 
          just the poor working man that's 
          paid to hunt you down.

     The room is filling up with deputies. Poole, Biggs, 
     Stevens, Newman.

     Kimble takes the phone and bangs it down onto a table and 
     we realize he is in Sykes' kitchen.

     He thinks he hears FOOTSTEPS over the phone, realizes Kimble

     Renfro looks up from the address to Gerard, stunned.

          Holy shit. We've got a car there

          Kimble's prints are all over the

          is here.

     The Tech takes out the check stubs, some papers; the pack

     The Tech flips through the pack, stops on the Lentz/Sykes

          He flips through the pack but

     He hands the Lentz/Sykes photo.

                    GERARD
          Let me see the negatives.

     The Tech hands him the strip of negative film. Gerard holds 
     it up to the light.

                    GERARD
          One's missing.

     Gerard stares at the photo as his RADIO SQUAWKS.

     Sykes hears the footsteps but moves on up the stoop and 
     starts to enter his apartment, notices the front door 
     already open.

     Cops and Marshals in his house. Processing a crime scene.

                    SYKES
          You a cop?

                    GERARD
          My name is Gerard. U.S. Marshal's

     Sykes is caught off guard.

                    GERARD
          This morning a fugitive named 
          Richard Kimble made a call from your
          apartment.

     Sykes is dumbfounded.

                    SYKES
          Richard Kimble... I don't know a 
          Richard Kim -

     Poole produces a photo of Kimble.

                    SYKES
          Wait a minute... This is the doctor 
          who killed his wife... He claimed 
          the killer had a prosthetic limb. 
          You telling me he's coming after 
          me?

                    GERARD
          Would he have a reason to?

                    SYKES
          What the hell's that supposed to 
          mean? Because I have this?

     He lifts his prosthetic arm and stares at Gerard. Gerard 
     holds his look.

                    SYKES
          Look, a year ago some people came 
          to see me. They asked me questions 
          about the night of the murder and 
          I'll tell you the same thing I told
          them. I wasn't even in town then. 
          I was on a business trip.

     Gerard continues moving around the apartment.

                    GERARD
          What kind of business are you in, 
          Mr. Sykes?

                    SYKES
          Security.

                    GERARD
          Independent?

                    SYKES
          No, I work for a pharmaceutical 
          company. I handle security for its 
          top executives.

     Gerard holds up one of the fishing photographs with Lentz.

                    GERARD
          Any idea why Kimble would be 
          interested in these?

                    SYKES
          No. Just some doctors on a company 
          junket.

     Gerard puts the photos down with the one of Lentz on top. 
     Sykes eyes it.

                    SYKES
               (annoyed)
          Look, you mind if I talk to the cops 
          to see if anything's missing?

                    GERARD
          Kimble said he's putting together a 
          puzzle. We don't need to put it 
          together too, we just need to be 
          there when he gets to the next 
          piece.

     Gerard stops and looks back at Sykes' apartment.

     He eyes the group in the other room, moves around the corner 
     for more privacy. As he does we notice several of the men 
     watching. They exchange glances.

          That's an easy fix. So let's say he 
          was in town. Did the job. Everything 
          goes as planned with one problem.

          Instead of looking like a robbery

          find the hit man.

          Why? To share the blame? He'd still 
          go to prison.

     Gerard moves to the board. He takes down a card.

                    RENFRO
          You're underestimating the power of

          Mr. Gerard.

                    GERARD
          Doctor. Could I have a minute?

     He opens the door to an empty meeting room.

          He's a security specialist at 
          Devlin-Macgregor Pharmaceuticals.

     Kimble broke into his apartment.

                    NICHOLS
          I don't know him. You're getting 
          pretty desperate aren't you, Mr. 
          Gerard. I told you, you wouldn't 
          find Richard.

                    GERARD
               (beat)
          Dr. Kimble hasn't come back to you 
          for help, has he?

                    NICHOLS
          No. And it seems like we've been 
          over this ground before. Now if 
          you'll excuse me.

     Nichols moves to the door. Gerard looks again at the photo, 
     then stops him.

                    GERARD
          Dr. Nichols. Do you know the other
          man in the photograph?

     Nichols stops, looks at Lentz and lies.

                    NICHOLS
          I never saw him before.

     He leaves. Gerard watches him.

     Renfro looks down and sees flyer which says Nichols is 
     slated to talk that evening in the grand ballroom.

                    RENFRO

          Pathology Research," by Dr. Charles 
          Nichols.

     She works the fluorescent stains. Makes notes.

     Kimble helps load the next sample.

                    KIMBLE
          Half the people in the study were 
          indigents. No follow-up, no baseline 
          on them. Who could say they didn't 
          come into the study with bad livers?

                    WAHLUND
          The one on the right is one of the 
          samples you sent me. It shows a lot 
          of perriportal inflammation loaded 
          with eosinophils. When you see that 
          with the accumulation of bile it's 
          a classic for -

                    KIMBLE
          - drug induced hepatitis.

                    WAHLUND
          I'm impressed. Now look at this.

     She positions a second slide.

                    WAHLUND
          According to the study, this is a 
          slice from the same liver.

     Kimble studies the slide. The tissue difference is markedly 
     different, clearer.

                    KIMBLE
          Cold normal.

                    WAHLUND
          Clearly not from the same tissue. 
          In fact.

     She yields the microscope to Kimble.

                    WAHLUND
          See this small area of bile duct 
          proliferation? Von Meyenberg's 
          Complex. Occurs in only 2% of the 
          population. But it's in every one 
          of your five samples.

     Kimble looks up.

                    KIMBLE
          That's statistically impossible.

                    WAHLUND
          That's because they're all from the 
          same liver.

     She smiles at Kimble.

          Yes.

          We're United States Marshals. We're 
          trying to find out some information 
          about a pathologist, named Lentz. He 
          used to be on staff here.

     Roosevelt suddenly goes on the defensive.

          He's dead.

     On the mention of Kimble, Roosevelt becomes visibly nervous.

          They'd be home free if I hadn't been 
          leaning on them to account for the 
          livers I was seeing. And I wouldn't 
          have seen the livers if I hadn't 
          told the guys on my service to call
          me when they had cases that were 
          bleeding excessively in surgery.

                    WAHLUND
          Big bucks. One schmuck standing in 
          the way. Easy, get rid of him and 
          his wife. But why Lentz?

                    KIMBLE
          Why not? He's one of the original 
          patent holders. Toss the samples I 
          sent, replace them with healthy 
          samples, issue the path report on 
          the healthy stuff-piece of cake.

     Kimble notices something in the report.

                    KIMBLE
          When did Lentz die?

                    WAHLUND
          Oh, last summer sometime. August... 
          Why?

     Kimble looks up from the protocol report.

                    KIMBLE
          Because a good third of the samples 
          Lentz approved were signed after he 
          died.

     Kathy comes to look at the report. Lentz's signature is 
     on reports dated October, November, December.

                    KIMBLE
          Someone else used Lentz's name.

          A pathologist at Devlin-Macgregor?

          They wouldn't have had the access. 
          They would have needed someone at 
          the hospital.

     Kimble opens the Devlin-Macgregor prospectus he took from 
     the medical library and opens it to the beginning. A photo

     Kimble reacts to the headline, looks away as the man turns 
     the pages.

     The man looks over the newspaper at Kimble, then goes back 
     to reading. A moment later he folds the paper back to the 
     front page.

     The man looks up from the paper and looks at Kimble again,
     then down.

     Coolly the man folds the paper, tucks it under his arm, 
     stands, looks through the car, then moves into one of the 
     rear cars.

     Kimble looks out the window - hoping desperately for his 
     car to reach the station. He keeps his head turned until 
     the man is gone.

     Sykes - the gun tucked next to his side - turns.

     The Cop sees Sykes' gun, reacts...

     But Sykes FIRES first, shoots the cop FOUR TIMES.

     As the Cop falls, Sykes turns quickly to finish Kimble. 
     But Kimble pulls the emergency brake over the door.

     Sykes is thrown to the floor - the gun slips from his grasp. 
     Kimble moves for the gun as Sykes comes up, catches Kimble 
     in the stomach, knocks him back. The fight carries on 
     throughout the car.

     Kimble reaches the gun first, lifts it in his left hand and 
     aims at Sykes. Sykes sees the gun in Kimble's hand and 
     almost smiles.

     SYKES
     Go ahead. You don't have it in you .

     For a moment Kimble almost fires, but instead he takes the 
     gun in his right hand and whips it across Sykes' face. 
     Then hits Sykes again and again with the butt of the gun, 
     driving him down the length of the car, knocking him almost 
     unconscious.

     Kimble tucks the gun in his belt and moves to the Transit 
     Cop. He checks for a pulse - there is none. The Cop is dead.

     Kimble takes the handcuffs and keys from the case on the 
     Cop's belt. He reaches for Sykes' wrist, drags him to the 
     Cop and cuffs Sykes to the dead Cop.

     He pockets the keys and grabs Sykes' hair, pulls his face 
     off the floor.

                    KIMBLE
          Not as easy as Helen, was it?
               (slams Sykes' head down, leaves)
          You missed your stop.

     He moves to the front of the car with Sykes' and the Transit 
     Cop's guns out. People back out of his way. He moves to 
     where the first two windows extend over the platform, kicks 
     out the front window and...

          down. Man leaving scene with two

          Kimble...

     Gerard looks out the window, he knows what this means.

               (quietly to himself)
          Damn...

     INT. HOTEL - MALL LEVEL / LOBBY - NIGHT

     Kimble moves up escalators from the underground station 
     into the Hilton.

     INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

     Disheveled and driven, he moves from the escalators to the 
     lobby - checks the list of hospitality suites and sees 
     board which indicates Nichols speech in the rooftop 
     ballroom. He moves on to the main elevators.

     Nichols speaking. As he talks we MOVE TO...

     ANGLE ON TABLE OF MEN

     Listening - the same men we saw in the hospitality suite 
     when Nichols talked to Kimble. As we MOVE TIGHTER ON one 
     of the men, we notice his name tag says: Board of 
     Directors... Devlin-MacGregor Pharmaceuticals.

     INT. HILTON ROOFTOP ELEVATORS - NIGHT

     Kimble rides alone to the rooftop ballroom.

     CUT TO:

     EXT. HILTON HOTEL - NIGHT

     Gerard's car pulls up in front of the hotel. Police are 
     controlling pedestrians. Newman and Biggs, already decked 
     out in Kevlar, meet him.

                    NEWMAN
          C.P.D. just reported -

                    GERARD
          I heard. Was it Kimble?

                    BIGGS
          Conflicting reports, but the cops 
          are considering him a shooter.

     Heavily-armed CPD units pull up. Gerard stares at the police 
     presence. He starts toward the hotel where Kelly is 
     conferring with Kevlar-decked police captain.

                    POLICE CAPTAIN
          Witnesses say he entered hotel from 
          the subway.

                    KELLY
          Okay. I want it locked down. Start 
          on the lower levels.

     The captain moves off. Gerard intercepts the cop.

                    GERARD
          That's my man in there, Kelly.

                    KELLY
          Not since he took down one of ours, 
          Gerard. This is a police matter,
          now. Stay, the hell, out of it.

     Kelly moves off. Gerard watches him a moment then he looks 
     up to the roof. Newman hands Gerard his belt with his 
     backup piece.

                    GERARD
          C'mon, I know where he's going.

     He moves into the hotel with his deputies.

     INT. ROOFTOP ELEVATORS/PENTHOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Kimble exits the elevators and moves down the corridor to 
     the ballroom. A man tries to stop him at the doors, Kimble 
     simply moves him out of the way and opens the doors to:

     CUT TO:

     INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

     Nichols moves to the last of his speech as Kimble enters 
     at the rear

                    NICHOLS
          ... And I especially would like to 
          thank my researchers who helped me...

     Nichols stops his speech - stunned to see Kimble.

                    NICHOLS
          Richard...

                    KIMBLE
          What's wrong, Charlie? Surprised?

     Kimble begins moving down the aisle past the tables of 
     doctors toward the podium.

     We see the faces of Kimble's colleagues and friends from 
     the ballroom sequence earlier. At first no one notices 
     Kimble but as he makes his way toward the dais, the 
     applause fades and then room quiets. Whispers of:

                    CROWD
          It's Richard. It's Kimble.

     Stunned expressions.

     Kimble continues to the front, talking to Nichols as if 
     the room were empty.

                    KIMBLE
          After Lentz died, you were the only 
          one that had access to the 
          pathology reports.

     Nichols remains calm.

                    NICHOLS
          Reports? What are you?

                    KIMBLE
          You switched the samples and 
          falsified the reports so R.D.U.90 
          could get approval.

                    NICHOLS
          Richard, I don't know what you're 
          talking about?...

                    KIMBLE
          I have a set of the original 
          samples.

     Nichols stares at Kimble and for the first time we see a 
     flicker of concern.

                    KIMBLE
          You almost pulled it off, Charlie. 
          But I know all about it now, and I 
          can prove it.

     Nichols and Kimble hold a look. Nichols turns to the audience.

                    KIMBLE
          Ladies and gentlemen. My friend, as 
          you can see, is obviously not well. 
          Richard, if you want to talk -

                    KIMBLE
          I didn't come here to talk

     Nichols leaves the dais and heads toward the exit.

     Kimble tracks along with him - moving through the tables - 
     passing the table with the Devlin-MacGregor board of 
     directors. They are disturbed by this situation.

     ON NICHOLS

     Moves through a door and exits into...

     HALLWAY

     Kimble follows moving through the tables and people to 
     reach the door.

     As soon as he's gone there are calls for "security." Doctors 
     move for the exits.

     CUT TO:

     INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

     Gerard, Renfro, Newman, Biggs and Poole move into the lobby.
     Police move to cover the lower floors.

          Let them keep busy down below. 
          Newman, get with security. See if 
          you can locate Kimble from the 
          monitors. Keep in radio contact.

     Newman branches off to Hotel Security. The rest follow 
     Gerard to the rooftop elevators.

     EXT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

     ROARING over Chicago skyline. The bright red sign of the 
     Hilton Hotel looms ahead.

     CUT TO:

     INT. HALLWAY / HOSPITALITY SUITE - NIGHT

     Nichols moves down hallway and turns into a hospitality 
     suite. A moment later Kimble follow and enters the...

     HOSPITALITY SUITE

     ... and is immediately smashed with a chair by Nichols. 
     Kimble goes flying, stunned. Nichols locks the door.

                    NICHOLS
          Your best quality, Richard, is that 
          you don't give up -

     Nichols pulls Kimble to his feet.

                    NICHOLS
          ... even when it's clearly in your 
          best interest to...

     He hits him again, drives him back into the library.

     Kimble tries to recover as Nichols relentlessly stays on 
     him. He pulls him up, slams him against the fire escape 
     doors.

                    NICHOLS
          I always knew that I'd have to kill 
          you.

     He drives a blow into Kimble's stomach.

                    NICHOLS
          Now, I must thank you for giving me 
          200 witnesses tonight who will 
          support me... when I tell them it 
          was self-defense...

     He shoves Kimble through the door out into...

     EXT. FIRE ESCAPE BALCONY - NIGHT

     ... and almost over the railing. Kimble grabs the rail to 
     keep from dropping to the street. Nichols closes on him, 
     but Kimble rolls away at the last minute and knocks 
     Nichols back against the other side of fire escape.

                    KIMBLE
          You missed your chance, Charlie...

     Nichols charges Kimble, but Kimble drives him back with 
     two crushing blows that send Nichols down the stairs.

     Kimble moves down the stairs after him - passing under a 
     security camera.

     CUT TO:

     INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

     A room lined with security monitors. Two security personnel 
     sit in front of their console. Newman stands behind them.

     On screen: We see Kimble moving down the stairs toward 
     Nichols, who pulls himself to his feet.

     Newman stands in front of the screen, talks to his radio.

                    GERARD
          I want them covered.

     EXT. HOTEL ROOFTOP FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

     Nichols rises to his feet, swings, but Kimble blocks the 
     blow and lands another that sends Nichols down another 
     set of stairs to the roof.

                    KIMBLE
          You took everything away from me... 
          for money.

     INT. BALLROOM ELEVATORS - NIGHT

     Gerard and the marshals reach the ballroom floor. The 
     elevator doors open to a flood of confused and disoriented 
     doctors trying to escape. The marshals wade through, meet 
     up with two hotel security guards.

                    GERARD
          This way.

     EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

     Kimble pulls Nichols to his feet. They are silhouetted by 
     the lights of the city skyline.

          I want to know, Charlie... was it 
          worth it...?

                    NICHOLS
          This thing is bigger than even you 
          think, Richard. You can't stop it.

     He hits Nichols again with tremendous force, knocking him 
     against the parapet. Nichols stares over the edge - the 
     street appears far below.

     INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

     Gerard and his deputies work their way into the ballroom. 
     The deputies move to separate areas. Several doctors point 
     them in the direction Kimble and Nichols fled.

     EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

     Kimble reaches Nichols and draws to hit him again as the 
     HELICOPTER suddenly ROARS over the rooftop. Its beam hits 
     the two men and a VOICE booms from the helicopter:

                    VOICE FROM HELICOPTER (V.O.)
          Chicago police. Freeze.

     In the instant of shock, Nichols knees Kimble and bolts.

               (to doctors)
          Clear the hallway.
               (to security)
          Get that door open.

     The door opens and Gerard moves quickly through the 
     hospitality suite for the rooftop.

                    GERARD
               (to security)
          Stay at this door.

     He moves through the door to the roof alone.

     Newman watching the security monitors sees Kimble and 
     Nichols. On another monitor we see Gerard exit the suite.

     EXT. ROOF - NIGHT

     Nichols runs.

     Kimble recovers, sees Gerard moving down the fire escape 
     toward him, and Nichols escaping. He goes after Nichols.

     The helicopter circles back over the roof, illuminating the 
     rooftop in its million-candle-power beam.

                    HELICOPTER PILOT (V.O.)

     The helicopter swings out to keep Kimble in sight.

     FOLLOWING Kimble. Its beam tracking Kimble across the 
     rooftop. He moves through the blowers and duct work. 
     Kimble is gaining ground on Nichols.

     He is about to fire when he hears through his radio.

     Nichols' head rocks from the impact.

     The GLASS GROANS. The wire stresses. The caulking begins 
     to drop.

     Nichols struggles but Kimble has him in control. Slams 
     him down hard again.

     HELICOPTER

     Circles, illuminates the struggle in its spotlight and 
     Gerard closing.

     Kimble slams Nichols one more time against the glass 
     and the wire holding the glass gives way, sending Kimble 
     and Nichols into...

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

     Kimble and Nichols, locked together, fall down the shaft 
     and crash onto the roof of the descending elevator car. 
     Nichols crashes through the ceiling into the car. Kimble 
     hits and slides across the roof to the edge, stopping 
     himself, just before he falls into the shaft. An 
     elevator car rushes toward him out of the blackness.

     Gerard reaches the elevator housing, looks down into the

     giant machines.

     INT. ELEVATOR CAR/LAUNDRY - NIGHT

     Kimble drops from the ceiling into the car and moves 
     carefully into the laundry.

     ... like an industrial jungle. Dimly lit, filled with 
     DEAFENING MACHINERY. Five hundred pound bags of laundry 
     move from a network of ceiling tracks to a pair of 
     heavyduty conveyor belts and two thirty-foot long washers.

     ... At the other end of the washers, hydraulic presses 
     stamp out three-foot diameter "cakes" which are moved by 
     conveyor and dollies to automated dryers.

     The NOISE is DEAFENING.

     INT. LAUNDRY - NIGHT

     Nichols pushes through the hanging laundry bags toward an 
     exit, tries the door. It is secured with a collapsible 
     grating with a padlock. He looks up, keeps moving.

     KIMBLE

     Notices the swinging bags, follows Nichols' trail. He 
     stops to get his bearings, sees shadow at the far end of 
     the room between the two washers. Kimble closes in, moving 
     between the large conveyors.

     ANGLE - SORTING ROOM

     Gerard enters sorting room with Renfro. He sees two sorters 
     standing by a small conveyor as he enters.

                    GERARD
          Get out of here.

     He and Renfro move around the corner where a laundry 
     worker is hooking a 500 lb bag of lines onto the overhead 
     rail. A hydraulic lift, operated by a hanging on/off 
     switch raises the bag on a yellow steel I-beam. The worker 
     takes one look at Gerard and abandons his station.

     Gerard, Biggs and Renfro move to the closed doors of the 
     main room.

                    GERARD
               (to Renfro)
          We're going in. Give me five 
          minutes. Keep C.P.D. out.

     He draws his Glock, opens the door and enters the main 
     room.

     INT. LAUNDRY - ON KIMBLE - NIGHT

     He moves to end of washers, using the machines as cover.

     He sees the shadow again takes a pole leaning against the 
     dryer as a weapon, turns the corner and is about to belt 
     him when he realizes it's not Nichols, but a laundry worker.

     Kimble moves away from the terrified man, when he hears a 
     voice from the other end of the laundry.

                    GERARD (V.O.)
               (above the din)
          Kimble!

     Kimble reacts to Gerard's voice, moves away.

     ON NICHOLS

     Moving behind machinery, sees light at far end of the room 
     where Gerard enters.

     ON GERARD

     The door closes automatically behind Gerard and Renfro.

     They enter the noisy main room and separate. Renfro moves 
     up the far side of the room, Gerard up the center. Both 
     move slowly through the maze of bags, carts, automated 
     equipment.

                    GERARD
          ... There is no way out of here.

     The building is locked down.

     CUT TO:

     KIMBLE

     Moves instinctively back into the machinery and carts near 
     the conveyor belts.

                    GERARD (O.S.)
          Kimble... I know about Nichols. I 
          know about Sykes. Kimble stops.

     ON GERARD

                    GERARD
          ... Nichols borrowed your car the 
          night of the murder and called 
          Sykes from it.

     RENFRO

     Separated from Gerard. He hears a NOISE behind him - a bag 
     comes down the track at break-neck speed, Renfro spins, 
     dodges it, gets his bearings and continues.

     KIMBLE

     Listening. He watches the movement of bags as he did with 
     Nichols.

     GERARD

     Moving through the forest of massive bags.

                    GERARD
          ... That's why there was no forced 
          entry at your house. He'd used your 
          keys.

     KIMBLE 

     Realizing what Gerard knows. Considering his next move.

     NICHOLS

     Also listening. He realizes Gerard now knows he's the 
     killer. He moves behind the water softener tanks and 
     chemicals - and spots Renfro - and something else -the 
     hanging control for the I-beam.

     GERARD

     Moves carefully. Another bag comes down the track. He 
     dodges it and steps into an open track. From here he can 
     see straight back toward the washers. 

                    GERARD
          Kimble... Come meet me out here.

     ON RENFRO

     He steps out and then back as a bag shoots by. He ducks 
     under the bag - into the next track and suddenly hears a 
     WHIRRING sound behind him. Renfro turns as an I-beam comes 
     rushing down the open track and knocks him to the floor, 
     opening a gash across the side of his head. He lays still.

     NICHOLS

     Steps out of the shadows, turns him over exposing his empty 
     shoulder harness and takes the gun from Renfro's hand. 
     Nichols moves toward Gerard with the gun.

     GERARD

     Oblivious to this action, moves on, passes the conveyor 
     belts. He makes one last appeal.

                    GERARD
          It's time to quit running... if you 
          don't, you know I'll stop you. He 
          listens, there is no answer.

     KIMBLE

     Starts to move out to meet Gerard, sees Renfro down. His 
     shoulder harness is empty. He knows Nichols is armed.

     GERARD

     Moves into the alley between the two giant washers. He 
     pauses, looks back, then continues, when he turns his back 
     on us...

     NICHOLS

     Steps INTO FRAME behind him and slowly takes aim. Just 
     before he fires however he hears...

                    KIMBLE (O.S.)
          Hey, Chuckles...

     Nichols turns toward the voice as Kimble swings the stick 
     and clocks him - sending the gun skittering on the floor 
     behind Gerard.

     GERARD

     Turns on the sound and finds his gun trained on Kimble 
     with Nichols at his feet, unconscious. He realizes 
     instantly that Kimble saved his life and lowers his gun.

     Kimble, exhausted, leans against the washer.

     They hold a look as deputies and police flood into the 
     room surrounding Kimble and handcuffing him.

     INT. / EXT. HILTON HOTEL - NIGHT (LATER)

     Chicago Police hold back crowds of onlookers on Michigan 
     Avenue. Police cars and vans, television news trucks vie 
     for space in front of the Hilton Towers.

     Dr. Charles Nichols, on a stretcher, loaded into an 
     ambulance. The doors close.

     REPORTERS and television cameramen line the sidewalk 
     giving reports and interviewing doctors from the ballroom. 
     We PICK UP pieces of their reports as we MOVE PAST them 
     TOWARD the entrance.

                    T.V. NEWS REPORTER
          ... As we reported a few minutes 
          ago, the saga of once-prominent 
          Chicago surgeon, Dr. Richard Kimble, 
          who escaped from an Illinois 
          Corrections bus, took a strange
          twist this evening when Dr. Kimble 
          was captured at the Chicago Hilton...

     ANOTHER REPORTER continues:

                    ANOTHER REPORTER
          ... there are unconfirmed reports 
          from police of new evidence which 
          may exonerate Kimble while 
          implicating some of the biggest 
          names in medicine...

     The doors to the police van close amid a flurry of 
     photographs.

     A third reporter interviews a STUNNED DOCTOR from the 
     ballroom:

                    STUNNED DOCTOR
          He just walked in... We didn't know 
          what he was going to do. My wife 
          was very frightened... The next 
          thing I knew cops were charging in 
          and...

     CUT TO:

     INT. HOTEL - NIGHT

     Kimble, in handcuffs, is escorted by Biggs, Newman, Poole 
     and Gerard, out of the hotel into the waiting chaos. 
     Renfro, his head bandaged, is helped by paramedics.

     EXT. HOTEL / INT. CAR - NIGHT

     As soon as the group exits the hotel. Television lights 
     flood the scene. Kimble lowers his head. Reporters crowd 
     forward, yelling questions.

                    REPORTER
          Dr. Kimble, is it true you can prove 
          your innocence!

     Gerard wants the crowd controlled.

                    GERARD
               (to police)
          Get them back.

     The marshals ant cops clear a line for Kimble to get into 
     a waiting car away from the media. Biggs opens the back 
     door and helps Kimble inside.

                    BIGGS
          Watch your head, Dr. Kimble.

     Newman climbs in behind the wheel. Gerard in the back next 
     to Kimble. He leans out the window and motions to Poole.

                    GERARD
               (to Poole)
          Poole, you got that thing?
               (to Kimble)
          Give me your hands.

     Kimble pauses, then holds up his wrists and Gerard unlocks 
     Kimble's handcuffs.

     Poole hands an ice-pack over the seat. Gerard places the 
     pack on Kimble' 9 bruised and battered hands.

                    GERARD
          Take care of those hands, Doc, 
          you're going to need them again 
          soon.

                    KIMBLE
          I thought you told me 'you didn't 
          care.'

                    GERARD
          Yeah, well, don't spread it around.

     They share a look of mutual respect as the car pulls away.

     HELICOPTER POV

     The car carrying Kimble pulls onto Michigan Avenue heading 
     back downtown. As we PULL BACK we see Kimble's car - at 
     first alone on the great avenue - then gradually joined 
     by other cars until finally becoming integrated in the 
     traffic, movement and lights of the city.

                                                    FADE OUT

                         THE END
