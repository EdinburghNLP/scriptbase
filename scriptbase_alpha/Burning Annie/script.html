           Abrupt CLOSE UP on MAX, a plain wall behind him.
                         
<b>          1 INT. LIMBO RADIO 1
</b>                         
           He is 20, normal looking, not too nebbish, punkish, bookish,
           or stylish. He is a high-strung guy, enjoying a rare moment
           of un-self-consciousness.
                         
<b>                          MAX
</b>           There's an old joke. It comes from "The
           Iliad," but I think it was popularized by
           Oscar Wilde. It goes like this:
           ...A bear's taking a shit, like, out in the
           woods one day. And he sees this rabbit,
           also taking a shit. The rabbit, wait, I
           mean, the bear, he's shitting up a storm,
           cuz he's been eating Mexican. The
           wiping's taking forever, and his shit
           keeps sticking to his fur. Wait, what
           happens next? Oh, right-- he asks the
           rabbit if he ever has trouble wiping. The
           rabbit says no, shit just slides right
           off him. So the bear picks the rabbit up
           and wipes his ass with him.
           (pause, as if for applause)
           Well, I never said it was a good joke.
           And see, that makes it perfect, because
           it's pretty much the story of my life.
                         
           We can now see that he's perched on a stool, wearing a REM t-
           shirt and old jeans. He gesticulates vaguely as he talks.
                         
<b>                          MAX (CONT'D)
</b>           Growing up, my parents were huge Woody
           Allen fans. Still are. Personally, I hate
           him. Same thing with the Beatles, such a
           part of my background that I must have
           been about 16 by the time I realized how
           useless it was to rebel by ignoring the
           Beatles or any other cultural artifact of
           their generation. Even if I did spend my
           childhood hearing my father go on and on
           about how, like, Nirvana would never mean
           anything because they're not the Beatles,
           blah-blah. I don't know, this is all
           starting to sound a little bit too
           angsty, you know, and that's about the
           last thing I'm going for here... Shit, I
           really got off track there, didn't I?
                         
           As Max shakes his head, a hanging RADIO MIKE comes into view.
           It has the call letters of a college radio station on it.

           High on the wall behind him, a glowing "ON AIR" light is
           revealed. The perspective is skewed, the studio appears
           cavernous and completely barren.
                         
<b>          2 INT. MAX'S CHILDHOOD HOME ­ FLASHBACK ­ DAY 2
</b>                         
           YOUNG MAX, about five, sits on the floor and watches BANANAS
           with his FATHER, a large, relaxed man with a mustache who
           reclines in a tacky 80's chair and smokes a cigar.
                         
<b>           MAX (O.S.)
</b>           Anyway, like the Beatles thing­ and this
           is the point of that whole long-winded
           example­ I was force-fed Woody Allen from
           a young age. I remember watching Bananas
           when I was about five. Of course, I hated
           it.
                         
           Young Max is laughing hysterically at the screen.
                         
           Max stands to the side, watching his younger self and his
           father. The radio mike hangs in front of him.
                         
<b>                          MAX (CONT'D)
</b>           This is my old house. We lived here, in a
           dull suburb of New York, until I was ten,
           when we moved to a different house in a
           different dull suburb of New York.
                         
           On TV, a woman is bit in the breast by a snake and is chased
           by a group of soldiers.
                         
<b>                          YOUNG MAX

           Young Max turns back to the screen, wide-eyed.
                         
<b>          3 INT. MAX'S SECOND HOME ­ FLASHBACK 3
</b>                         
           In pajamas, ADOLESCENT MAX, 16, watches a newer TV in an
           identical family room. This time, ANNIE HALL is playing.
                         
<b>           MAX (V.O.)
</b>           Oh yeah. This wasn't the first time I saw
           Annie Hall, but it was the first time I
           actually appreciated it. I was flipping
           channels on a Saturday afternoon, and
           there it was, and I was stunned to find I
           loved it, more stunned to find that my
           parents may have had a point all along.

<b>          4 INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY ­ FLASHBACK 4
</b>                         
           Adolescent Max walks alone to class. Other students rush by
           in groups. He looks a little lost.
                         
<b>           MAX (V.O.)
</b>           Oh God, high school. I hated this place.
           I was a Junior when I gave up trying to
           fit in. Fortunately, being a social
           outcast is a lot easier when your school
           is filled with idiots.
                         
           A pair of GOTH POSERS pass. Max keeps his distance. From the
           other direction, a 6 FOOT TALL GIRL makes eyes at Max. He
           walks into a water fountain, drops his books.
                         
<b>          5 INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM ­ FLASHBACK 5
</b>                         
           Adolescent Max gets hit in the face with a volleyball.
           Everyone laughs at him, including the COACH.
                         
           Max stands to the side and winces.
                         
<b>                          MAX
</b>           There was something in Annie Hall I
           identified with. Maybe it was the style
           of humor, or the defeatist attitude, I
           don't know. All I know is, I kept going
           back. Different people are inspired by
           different things, and my source of
           inspiration became a 20-year-old movie
           about a failed relationship.
                         
           The volleyball rolls over and he picks it up.
                         
<b>          6 INT. RADIO STATION -- PRESENT 6
</b>                         
           From behind Max, we see the station as it really is: small,
           dark, cramped, and totally filled with crap. Max wears
           headphones, sits before a large console and audio gear.
                         
           He now holds a volleyball.
                         
<b>                          MAX
</b>           So after high school I ended up here.
           There was never really any choice, not
           going to college was not an option. Of
           course, I brought Annie with me. Good
           thing, too.

           Max is with five friends in the double, and they all have
           lingering style-baggage from high school (eg. bad haircuts).

</b>           It was freshmen year when we started
           watching Annie Hall as a tradition.
<b>                          (LOOKING AROUND)
</b>           Jeez, this must have been the very first
           time. What's Amy doing here? I'm pretty
           sure Amy wasn't here.
                         
           AMY is attractive, bookish, and sitting on Max's bed.
           CHARLES, a skinny guy in a large chair, tries to get her
           attention by wiggling his eyebrows seductively.
                         
           Max puts the tape in the VCR, hits rewind, and moves to sit
           on his bed. He pauses when he sees how close he'll come to
           Amy. Finally, he climbs over her and awkwardly sits at the
           far end.
                         
           Amy watches, rolls her eyes, and looks at BETH, who shakes
           her head sadly. Beth is pretty in an earthy way, spunky and
           sad at the same time. She looks sympathetically at Max, who
           is trying not to act nervous (and failing).
                         
           The couple is SAM, who's short and charismatic, with a cool,
           slightly punkish personal style; and JEN, same height, cute
           and serious, conservative dress. They lie on the floor
           together.

</b>           That's Sam and Jen. Sam was the alpha-
           male of our group, which tends to consist
           mostly of zeta-males. He had been going
           out with Jen a couple weeks and we were
           all waiting to see if she would change
           him...
                         
           Sam slides a pillow under her.
                         
<b>                          SAM

<b>                          JEN
</b>           I'm fine, Sam. I was worried about you.
           Sure you don't want me to move over?

</b>           Oh no, no, Jen, if you're happy, I'm
           happy.
                         
           Max and Charles exchange a look-- there they go again. Max
           makes a show of putting a pillow under a large Darth Vader
           doll. Beth laughs, Amy is amused. Sam looks back and is
           embarrassed. Jen rolls her eyes and gives Sam a look.

</b>           Uh, thanks, I guess. Does that mean you

           Max and Amy stand and face each other as the lights fade to

</b>           I didn't say I liked it, I said it
           reminded me of you. It reminded me of
           what I didn't like about you, the
           cynicism, the neurotic insecurity, and oh
           yeah, when you started calling me every
           day. All the reasons we were never more
           than friends.

</b>           Well, at least you're being honest.

           Charles walks by, Amy takes his arm, and they disappear into
           the surrounding darkness, which DISSOLVES TO:

           The movie is Annie Hall. The theater is emptying. Suddenly,
           ERICA bursts through the crowd. Erica is mad. Max follows
           behind her, placating.

           Max freezes in place. The entire crowd of students turns to
           look at him. He manages a weak smile and turns back to Erica,
           but she's gone, out the doors into the night.
                         
           Max turns back to the crowd and shrugs, but the crowd turns
           away. Max suddenly sees someone: Beth, looking at him. He
           blushes, self-conscious, and hurries away.

           as we all do, so it doesn't leave much
           room for discussion. We mostly only talk

          Amanda takes the negatives, opens the door to a closet, hangs
          them from a clothespin, and leaves. Max takes his, selects a
          clothespin, and knocks several others to the floor. He tries
          to pick them up, and manages to step on them.

          bag. At the door, he notices one stuck to his shoe.

           always men around. During fire drills,
           more guys come out than girls. Never the

           the crowd is mostly one big mosh pit.
                         
           Max wades through the slamdancers, freaked. He makes it to
           the coffee bar. Julie soon appears, sweaty. She's been here
           awhile.

           The surging crowd shoves Max into Julie. They fall against
           each other. Max is near panic but Julie's laughing, getting
           off on the energy of the room.
                         
           The SINGER smashes the mic against the wall, then brandishes
           the stand menacingly at the crowd, who step back in alarm.

           mix of people here, you've got these men
           with their suits, taking their waitress
           girlfriends out to impress them into bed,
           because they can't get them any other
           way. Really, as if a fast car can ever
           make up for a small dick.

          Tommy walks in, half asleep, in his pajamas. He turns on the
