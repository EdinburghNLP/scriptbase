                                                         March 2008
<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         BEGIN CREDITS:
</b>
<b>          EXT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - DAY
</b>
          An idyllic American factory. There's a huge, long lawn in
          front. A Reynolds Extract sign in brick with
          flowers/landscaping around it, sits near the entrance. We
          see from the number of cars in the parking lot that it's a
          company of about 50 - 75 employees.

<b>          INT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - DAY
</b>
          We are in a manufacturing area of an assembly-line
          production. It's a big room full of intricate machines, huge
          vats of different colored extract and other food flavoring
          products, conveyor belts, bottling machines, etc. It has a
          high ceiling with offices on the second floor that have big
          windows overlooking this manufacturing area.
          We PAN up to the main office.

<b>          INSIDE THE OFFICE
</b>          JOEL REYNOLDS, head of the company, mid-thirties, is on the
          phone with his friend DEAN.
          DEAN (v.o.)
          You should come by tonight. Half
          price well drinks while the game's
          going.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          You always give me free drinks
          though.
          DEAN (v.o.)
          Oh yeah. Well come by anyway.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Yeah?... Might as well. No action
          going on at my house, that's for
          sure.
          DEAN (v.o.)
          Really? The wife out of town?

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          No... I just haven't been laid in
          a month.

<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>          2.
</b>          DEAN (v.o.)
          You guys having problems or
          something?

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          No. This is pretty much normal
          these days...
          As CREDITS continue, camera PULLS OUT, back down to the
          manufacturing area, past a big vat of orange extract, down
          through various stages of assembly line production, then
          follows several bottles of orange extract moving past
          HECTOR, a Mexican immigrant employee in his thirties. The
          camera stops on him. Talking to Hector is STEP, a short,
          beady-eyed Charles-Manson-looking guy with a beard and
          mustache. Step is in his forties. He makes everything he
          says sound as macho and important as possible.

<b>                         STEP
</b>          You get this job through Manpower?

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                         STEP
</b>          I started here with Manpower too.
          Started out on the line just like
          you.

<b>                         (DEAD-SERIOUS)
</b>           Only I did better... 40 crates a
          day. 
          Beat. Hector is not quite sure what he's talking about.
          STEP continues telling his tale in such a way that the only
          polite reaction would be one of total amazement.

<b>                         STEP (CONT'D)
</b>          I'm the best sorter in here.
          That's why they made me full time
          with benefits. I'll probably be
          floor manager this year.
          A FEW FEET AWAY we see RORY, a stocky indie-rock geek, with
          too many tatoos, hair shaved on the side with a ponytail,
          lots of bad piercings, wearing baggy shorts with lots of
          pockets and some kind of gothy T-shirt -- a look that ought
          to be out of style by now.

<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>          3.
</b>          Rory is putting stickers on boxes with a sticker gun. He
          flips the sticker gun around unnecessarily between each
          application, adding a few unnecessary moves/motions, slapping
          each box when he's done, generally making the activity look
          like more of a skill than it actually is. He approaches Step
          and Hector, pulling out some fliers from his many pockets.

<b>                         RORY
</b>          (hands them each a flier)
          My band's playing this Friday, come
          check us out.
          Hector looks down at the flier. It's xeroxed with fifties
          clip-art, cut out letters and the name of the band, "God's
          Cock". Hector just looks at it confused, not knowing much
          English, not sure what he's supposed to be doing with the
          flier.
          AT THE END OF THE LINE, where boxes are loaded onto pallets,
          sits MARY, 58 years old, wearing a 15-year-old pair of acid-
          wash jeans, and an oversized tweety-bird T-shirt, fanny pack,
          and dayglow yellow triangle-shaped earrings. She's pear-
          shaped with short hair. She's bitter and bossy, always
          shaking her head at everyone. She sits on a stool with a
          clipboard, looks over her glasses at Hector, shaking her
          head. She talks to Gabriella, a Hispanic woman in her
          forties.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          You see that... That new guy.
          He's holding us up. It's not my
          job to tell them to hold the line
          either.

<b>                         GABRIELLA
</b>          And then Joel's gonna come yell at
          us, cuz he's not doing his job.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          (folds her arms, fed up)
          I'm just gonna sit here.

<b>                         GABRIELLA
</b>          You're not gonna shut it off?

<b>                         MARY
</b>          I'm not gonna hold the line. If
          they're not gonna do their job, why
          should I do mine.
          Mary sits there, arms folded, lips pursed, refusing to pause
          the conveyor belt.

<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>          4.
</b>
<b>          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          Joel is still on the phone with Dean.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          If I don't get home before about
          8:00, she puts on the sweatpants
          and once the sweatpants are on,
          it's over -- I get nothing.
          (notices something down

<b>                         BELOW)
</b>          Shit. I'm gonna have to call you
          back.
          Joel hangs up and runs downstairs.

<b>          ON THE MANUFACTURING FLOOR:
</b>          Boxes start to accumulate and fall off the end of the line.
          Step sees this, runs to shut off the line, yelling at Mary.

<b>                         STEP
</b>          What are you doing?!

<b>                         MARY
</b>          What are YOU doing?!
          (pointing at Hector)
          What is he doing?
          A YELLING/BICKERING MATCH breaks out between Mary, Step, Rory
          and Gabriella. Joel runs over, shuts off the conveyor belt.

<b>                         JOEL (CONT'D)
</b>          All right. Now, what's the
          problem?
          They all erupt in more BICKERING AND FINGER POINTING.

<b>                         JOEL (CONT'D)
</b>          Okay! Okay, everyone settle down.
          Now Mary. Hector here is new okay?
          It's gonna take him a couple of
          days, maybe his English isn't so
          good. You gotta be patient.

<b>                         STEP
</b>          That's what I was tryin' to say.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          And Step, if you wanna be Floor
          Manager, this is the kind of thing
          you're going to have to deal with.

<b>                         
</b>
<b>

<b>                         (KISS-ASS)
</b>          Exactly.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Okay, now Step, Rory, Hector, let's
          get this cleaned up, and get
          rolling again. We can't afford to
          fall behind today.
          Joel walks away. People resume their posts. Mary starts
          right back up with Gabriella.

<b>          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER
</b>
          Joel sits in his swivel chair, looking down at the production
          floor, shaking his head. BRIAN, Joel's second in command,
          walks in. He's a little older than Joel, neatly trimmed
          beard, aviator glasses, and a bit of a gut. He wears a
          Reynold's Extract golf shirt and Khaki pants. He walks over
          to the window, joins Joel, looking down at the employees.

</b>          Jesus... They're like a bunch of 
          goddamned children. 

<b>                         BRIAN
</b>          Tell me about it. Sorry I missed
          the drama; I was showing boy-genius
          down there how to back up a
          forklift.
          ANGLE ON Rory, driving the forklift, handing out a flier as 
          he passes someone. 

<b>                         BRIAN (CONT'D)
</b>          That's his whole career, driving
          that damn forklift. You'd think
          he'd wanna learn how.

          "axed" me -- for more personal

          maybe if she figures out how to
          fill out the time sheets correctly
          I'll give her more personal days...
          (Off Joel's look)
          Don't worry, she will never fill
          out her time sheets correctly.
          Joel looks down at the production floor. Joel's POV: 
           ANGLE ON: Mary and Step bickering. Step walks off. Mary and 
           Gabrielle shaking their heads and yapping like a couple of 
          old hens.

          Joel leaves in a hurry, mumbling something about 
          "sweatpants." 

<b>          INT. JOEL'S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
          Joel drives home, in a hurry, checking his dashboard clock.
          It's an upscale neighborhood of McMansions in a town like
          Lincoln Nebraska. He turns a corner, slows down suddenly
          when he sees something.

<b>                         JOEL'S POV:

          crosses the street to Joel's driveway and waits to talk to
          him.

          Joel pulls into his driveway as Nathan flags him down. Joel
          begrudgingly rolls down the passenger side window so Nathan
          can talk to him.

<b>                         NATHAN
</b>          Hi there Joel! Glad I caught ya...
          Nathan settles in like he's going to be there a while,
          leaning with his arms folded, hanging inside the car,
          trapping Joel.

<b>                         NATHAN

</b>          Well, we wouldn't know anybody

          uncomfortable.

<b>                         NATHAN
</b>          Oh no -- It's not like that. She
          won't be uncomfortable. I

          what she says. Like I say, she
          won't be uncomfortable at all.
          Maybe I'll have Leslie give her a
          call -- you know how it is when the

<b>                         (CALLING BACK)

<b>          INT. JOEL'S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          Joel pulls the car in, steps out and is shocked to see Nathan
          right there in his garage.

<b>                         NATHAN
</b>          Sorry, I almost forgot -- the
          tickets are forty dollars a plate.
          I know that's a little steep, but
          the food is fantastic and it's for
          a good cause. So that'd be eighty
          dollars total. There's no tax or
          anything.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Ah, look Nathan, I really gotta get
          inside and make this call. Let's
          talk about this another time.
          Joel has his finger on the button to shut the garage door,
          waiting for Nathan to get out. Nathan stops, just inside.

          for the house or anything when you
          go out of town --
          Joel's finger still on the garage door button.

<b>                         NATHAN

          Joel hits the button and the door starts going down.

<b>                         NATHAN
</b>          Alright then. We'll see ya.
          Nathan finally steps out of the garage. Joel breaths a huge
          sigh of relief. Then,

<b>          ANGLE ON THE GARAGE DOOR:
</b>          As it gets halfway down, we see Nathan's legs, heading back
          towards the door. Nathan leans down into frame as the door
          goes down.

<b>                         NATHAN
</b>          Oh, Joel one more thing--

<b>          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - EVENING

          Joel walks into the living room just as his wife, SUZIE,
          enters from the bedroom pulling on her SWEATPANTS. A look of
          disappointment on Joel's face. Suzie is a decent looking
          woman, about Joel's age.

<b>                         JOEL

          gets closer, starts kissing her neck.

<b>                         DEAN

          with the shitty band that works for
          me probably gets laid more than I
          do.

          Yeah, but he probably lives in a

<b>          INT. MUSIC STORE - DAY
</b>
          CINDY, a girl in her early twenties, is at the counter
          looking at a new Gibson hollow-body electric guitar -- one of
          the really nice ones. The price tag says $3,950. She's
          beautiful and sexy and all that, but there's something
          vulnerable and sweet about her as well.
          Two SALESMEN, typical music store employees -- long-haired,
          goateed, nerdy cocky guitar-hacks are giving her way too much
          attention. It's clear that they don't usually have women
          this hot in their store. They practically stumble over each
          other trying to help her.

<b>                         SALESMAN #1
</b>          Yeah, it's expensive but it's
          sweet... Are you familiar with the
          Gibson humbucking pickups?

<b>                         CINDY
</b>          No, sorry. I don't play. It's for
          my Dad actually -- for his
          fiftieth birthday. My sisters and
          I are all pitching in.

<b>                         SALESMAN #2
</b>          Ah, that's nice... Your Dad would
          love these humbuckings. They
          really kick ass.
          An annoyed MALE CUSTOMER has been waiting behind Cindy,
          trying to get some help, but he might as well be invisible.
          He tries to address Salesman #2, off to the side.

          Both Salesmen's eyes are glued to Cindy as Male Customer
          finally gets sick of waiting and storms off into the keyboard
          room.

<b>                         CINDY
</b>          I think he played like, jazz or
          something. I'm not sure.

<b>                         SALESMAN #2
</b>          Well this is an excellent jazz
          guitar. It's what Pat Metheny
          plays.

<b>                         SALESMAN #1
</b>          Is your Dad into Metheny at all?

<b>                         CINDY
</b>          Oh, I don't know who that is.
          Sorry.

<b>                         SALESMAN #2
</b>          He's like, a totally kickass fusion
          guitarist. Are you into fusion?

</b>          I don't really know much about
          it...

</b>          I play fusion guitar so... Just
          curious.

</b>          Um, do they come in any other
          colors?

<b>                         SALESMAN #1
</b>          You mean different finishes?
          There's a sunburst finish we might
          have in stock.

          get it.

<b>                         SALESMAN #1
</b>          Or I could go. Whatever.

</b>          Oh totally./ No prob!/ I'll show
          you the case it comes with too.
          The salesmen practically trip over each other, going into the
          back to find the other guitar.
          Cindy stands there alone for a beat. She looks around. Then
          casually picks up the four-thousand dollar guitar and walks
          out the front door with it.

           Cindy walks a few yards over to her car, a ' 92 Tercel, puts
           the guitar in the trunk, gets in and takes off.

</b>
          The two Salesmen return -- one carrying the sunburst-finish
          guitar and the other with the hard-shell case. They look
          around, notice she's gone. They stand there for a beat,
          disappointed, before they realize what just happened.

          Joel lets it sink in. He walks over to the window, looking

</b>          Yeah it is, but I find it's good

          makes you feel good, so it sort of
          works for anything. I even take it

</b>          We see an article about Step's accident. There's a picture
          of Step being taken away on the stretcher.
          Cindy starts reading the article, with growing interest.

<b>                         CINDY'S POV:
</b>          She scans the article, zeroing in on certain words,
          ".. .potentially big settlement..." "...no testicles..."
          "several million dollars" then back to "no testicles" then
          quickly back and forth several times -- "million dollars" "no
          testicles" "million dollars" "no testicles"
          ON CINDY'S FACE - A look of determination. She looks one
          more time at the name under the picture -- Don "Step"
          Wilkenson, then zeroes in on the words "Reynold's Extract."
          She starts the car and speeds away.

<b>                         BRIAN
</b>          So obviously Step's not coming back
          anytime soon. I had to hire a

</b>          Better. They say he's going home
          in a couple of days. Speaking of
          which, the guys at General Mills
          heard about this whole Step thing.
          They're worried. If Step decides
          to sue us -- beyond the insurance
          settlement -- it could be a serious
          liability. They don't want to make
          an offer until this thing has
          settled.

<b>                         JOEL 
</b>          Really? They think it's that big 
          of a liability? 

<b>                         BRIAN
</b>          Well yeah. Don't you? I mean,
          think about it. Imagine if you
          asked a bunch of jurors how much
          you'd have to pay 'em to cut their
          balls off? I mean, I wouldn't let
          someone cut my balls off for a
          billion dollars. Seriously --
          unless there were some kind of
          really expensive operation that
          could give you artificial balls or
          something. Would you?

<b>                         JOEL 
</b>          No, I guess not. 

<b>                         BRIAN
</b>          Anyway, I wouldn't worry. He says
          he's not going to sue us. Says he

<b>                         (CRUDE IMITATION)
</b>          "don't want somethin' fer nothin "'
          and "What's right is right." If we
          can just get him to sign something
          to that effect we should be fine.

<b>                         JOEL 
</b>          Boy, Step sure is being mellow 
          about all this. 

<b>                         BRIAN
</b>          Yeah, well I think when you lose
          your balls it mellows you out. You
          don't get as pissed off and
          aggressive about things. I know
          it's true for horses, and bulls.

          Maybe things will be better after I
          sell the company... Or maybe it's
          just going to mean more time to sit
          around and contemplate not getting
          laid.
          Dean nods sympathetically.

<b>                         DEAN
</b>          What about that girl at work? She
          still into you?

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Yeah... she was really coming on to
          me. She gave me her phone number
          and everything. Told me to call
          her if I wanted to go to that
          party. Can you believe that? And
          there's nothing I can do about it,
          but just be sexually frustrated.

</b>          I've got some Xanax if you want it.

</b>          No, I can't. I can't cheat on
          Suzie. I just gotta power through
          it until I'm so old that I can't
          get it up anymore.

<b>                         DEAN

          Wouldn't that bother you?
          Joel thinks about it.

</b>          No. I don't think it would

          Step's truck is parked out at a lake in the country. He and
          Cindy sit next to each other on the tailgate, looking at the
          stars, talking.

<b>                         STEP
</b>          I just believe that what's
          right is right.

<b>                         CINDY
</b>          That's right Step, and what's right
          is for you to send a message.

<b>                         STEP
</b>          A message?

<b>                         CINDY
</b>          You need to send a message so that

          happens to anyone else ever again.
          That's what's right. And the way

          you shouldn't get aroused.

</b>          Maybe it was your lawyer, but he
          talked to your doctor. And your
          doctor said it's very important not
          to get aroused until after the
          trial... I'm sorry.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          NO! Try to pay attention okay? I
          will not be there. I will be at
          work. You come over to my house
          while I'm not there, posing as the
          new pool cleaner and then try to
          seduce her...
          Brad finally makes a breakthrough.

<b>                         BRAD
</b>          Oooh, I see. Sorry man. Yeah,
          yeah. I get it now. You're not
          even gonna be there...

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Yeah, that's right.

<b>                         BRAD
</b>          Yeah... cool. No problem. This is
          gonna be great!

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Remember, she might not go for it--
          Brad starts to get a little too excited.

<b>                         BRAD
</b>          Yeah, this is gonna be cool! I can
          hardly wait! Awesome. Hey man, if
          you know anyone else who needs --
          you know -- what I do, like you
          know, lonely housewives and shit,
          maybe you could tell 'em about me,
          you know...
          Joel looks on with growing concern as Brad can't seem to stop
          talking.

<b>                         BRAD
</b>          Cuz like, I figure if I did a
          few jobs and I was, like, really
          good? Then maybe they'd tell their
          friends, you know, and they'd give
          me a... what do you call those
          things?

<b>                         DEAN
</b>          Referrals.

<b>                         BRAD
</b>          Yeah yeah, those things. Then
          those women could tell more women
          and then it'd be like I was, like,
          uh... branching or..

<b>                         DEAN
</b>          Networking.

<b>                         BRAD
</b>          Yeah, networking! Totally. Then
          if I got enough of 'em, maybe I
          could quit my landscaping job and
          do this full time. That would be
          awesome! Cause I hate landscaping.
          I like getting laid a lot better,
          and my boss is a total dick...

          A break room with a kitchen. Joel is badly hungover. He
          looks like he's about to throw up as he reaches into the
          cupboard above the sink, downs a couple of aspirin, then
          drops some alka-seltzer in to a glass of water. Cindy comes

           As Brad's dopey narration continues, we see the story he's
           telling. It plays out like a bad soft-porn flick on Cinemax.
           We see Brad wiping the side of the pool with a rag.

<b>           BRAD (V.0.)
</b>           .I don't know anything about pool
           cleaning, so I was just faking it.

          Suzie comes out and lies on one of the reclining chairs.

<b>           BRAD (V.0.)

</b>          No. It's ours.

</b>          Wow, you look so young to be living

          Beat.

<b>                         BRAD
</b>          Do you have any sunscreen? I

<b>          BRAD (V.0.)
</b>          I thought that was pretty smart
          of me -- to ask her to borrow
          sunscreen. See, 'cuz that way,
          once she gave me some, I could ask
          her if she wanted some too, and rub
          some on her back, instead of just
          coming out and asking her to rub
          some on her. Pretty smooth huh?...
          We see Brad rubbing lotion on Suzie's back as she lies face-
          down on the chair.

<b>          BRAD (V.0.)
</b>          Once I was rubbing the sunscreen on
          her, the rest was easy...
          We see Brad's hands working their way down Suzie's back.
          Just as they start to move down towards her butt, Joel
          interrupts, YANKING US OUT OF THE FLASHBACK.

          JOEL'S POV: Nathan, the guy across the street is in his front
          yard, puttering around with the mail.

           Joel puts the car in reverse, starts to pull behind a parked
           car in an attempt to hide, but Nathan notices him, waves and
           crosses the street. Joel reluctantly pulls ahead to his
          driveway.

<b>                         NATHAN

</b>          Oh, I'm kind of busy actually.

<b>                         NATHAN
</b>          Yeah. Well I won't keep you. I
          just wanted to let you know, I got
          those tickets to that dinner we
          talked about on the 7th. I think I
          told you they were forty dollars a
          piece, but it turns out it's a tad
          more this year -- fifty-five -- so
          if I could go ahead and just get a
          check from you guys...

<b>                         JOEL

<b>                         NATHAN
</b>          No, this is the 7th. You said
          you're going out of town on the
          17th.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Yeah, but remember, I told you we
          didn't really want to go to this
          thing.
          Nathan looks dumbfounded. Joel is about to snap.

<b>                         NATHAN
</b>          But I already bought the tickets.
          I know you said something about her
          feeling uncomfortable, but, like I
          say, she won't feel uncomfortable
          at all -- I guarantee it.

          Joel and Suzie are eating dinner. Suzie has a glow about

          Joel's has a quietly pissed off demeanor. They eat in
          silence for a beat.

          a thrash/skatepunk thing. Godscock
          is more melodic stuff.

          past several cubicles where hardass parole officers meet with
          their parolees -- various gang-bangers, drug dealers,
          junkies, a hideous transvestite prostitute, etc. As we pan,
          each officer is giving them nothing -- "this is your last
          chance," "You expect me to believe that?", etc. We continue
          past officers giving them nothing, giving them nothing,
          ending on a cubicle with Cindy, where a PAROLE OFFICER is
          giving Cindy everything -- almost apologetic.

          Templeton a couple weeks back where
          someone stole an expensive guitar

<b>          BRAD (V.0.)
</b>          Look, don't worry about it bro'. I
          won't charge you for this one.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Won't charge me for...? You had
          sex with my wife again?!

<b>          BRAD (V.0.)
</b>          Well, I figured we already did it
          once, so what's the big deal? I
          mean, she said to stop by if I was
          in the neighborhood, so... Besides,
          I'm not gonna charge you--

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Not gonna charge...? God damn you!
          Yes you are gonna charge me! I'm
          gonna pay you! You're not having
          sex with my wife for free! And I
          better not ever catch you anywhere
          near my house ever again!
          Joel slams down the phone. Then realizes it's a cell phone,
          picks it back up and hits the "End" button.

<b>          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
</b>
          Suzie is asleep on the couch in her sweatpants. Joel walks
          through, mumbles something about going to a party.

<b>          INT. JOEL'S CAR -- NIGHT
</b>
          Joel pulls up to the house where the party is going on. He
          stays in the car, checking it out.
          Scanning Joel's POV, we see the band, Godscock, playing in
          the backyard, with Rory on bass. They are set up on the
          patio of this small two-bedroom suburban house. Most of the
          people at the party are crowded around the keg, which is on
          the other side of the backyard, ignoring the band. The band
          sounds awful -- loud as hell, unmusical, uninspired. The
          lead singer sings in that awful Eddie Vedder style, but even
          more loud and overly dramatic. Rory acts all intense, in
          stark contrast to the non-intensity of the music.

          It's downright pathetic.
          There's one drunk guy off to the side banging his head,
          playing air-guitar and stumbling into the bushes.
          Joel spots Cindy over by the keg, drinking, mingling. He
          watches her for a beat, then shakes his head and drives away.

<b>                          CUT TO:

<b>          INT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR -- NIGHT
</b>
          Joel sits at the bar talking to Dean, drinking a beer.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          I can't believe my wife slept with
          that guy.

<b>                         DEAN
</b>          Well... I thought you said it
          wouldn't bother you.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          I guess I didn't really think about
          it long enough... I just wish it
          hadn't been so easy for him.

<b>                         DEAN
</b>          Yeah, I'm tellin' ya, chicks really
          go wild for that Brad...
          (Off Joel's look)
          Sorry.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          No, you're right. He may be a
          stupid, dull-witted moron, but he
          can get any girl he wants. Me, I
          had to work for it. I had to work
          hard, get a career going, take
          Suzie out a bunch of times, marry
          her. But not Brad. He gets to
          waltz into my house and have sex
          with my wife just like that. Oh,
          and by the way? That little prick
          was at my house again today.

<b>                         DEAN
</b>          No shit? What was he doing?

<b>                         JOEL

          free.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          I'm not going to let him do it for
          free. No way. I'm paying him.

<b>                         DEAN
</b>          Really? How much?

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Oh, I don't know. The same, I
          guess. Why?

<b>                         DEAN
</b>          Hmm... So should I get my twenty
          dollars from Brad then or...
          Joel shoots Dean an angry look.

<b>                          DEAN (CONT'D)
</b>          We can worry about that later...
          Look at the bright side, now you
          can call Cindy.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          I don't know... I feel weird about
          it. Besides, she's at the party,
          she probably won't be home 'til
          late.

<b>                         DEAN
</b>          You know what you need to do?

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          (rolling his eyes)
          I don't wanna do drugs Dean.

<b>                         DEAN
</b>          Look, I know I joke around a lot,
          but this time I'm serious.
          (like a doctor)
          You should try smoking a little
          pot. It's just an herb, it heals.
          Stress can kill you, and--

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          I get paranoid when I smoke pot.

</b>          Not when you just smoke a little.
          Come on. You ever meet my friend
          Willie? Great guy. Really great
          guy.
          (as if it's a positive)
          He's the guy I got that horse
          tranquilizer from.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Oh, wonderful.

<b>          INT. WILLIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
</b>
          WILLIE loads up some kind of giant three-foot tall bong and
          inhales a massive bong-load. He's a burly ex-football player
          type who looks like he might have an extra y-chromosome or
          two. Joel watches Willie, feeling a little uneasy. Dean
          pontificates.

<b>                         DEAN
</b>          I've been reading about it --
          they're making technological
          advances now, coming up with great
          drugs that can make you happy and
          won't leave you with a hangover or
          nothin'.

<b>                         WILLIE
</b>          (holding in bong-hit)
          Right on.
          Willie finally exhales. The exhale seems to go on way longer
          than humanly possible, endless amounts of pot-smoke billowing
          out (accomplished with special FX). He finally hands the
          bong and lighter to Joel.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Oh, I don't know... I'm kind of a
          light weight. I think that's too
          much for me--

<b>                         WILLIE
</b>          (still holding out the
          bong and lighter)
          Bullshit.

<b>                         DEAN
</b>          Come on Joel. Don't worry, this
          stuff isn't that strong.

          Joel looks at Willie then at Dean, then takes the bong,
          partly out of being intimidated by Willie.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Ah, what the hell.
          Willie instructs Joel on the bong usage in the same
          condescending way a weight-lifting instructor would.

<b>                         WILLIE
</b>          Okay, now this is a gravity bong.
          Have you ever used one before?

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Umm, I think... no.

<b>                         WILLIE
</b>          Okay, pay attention. Put your
          thumb right here on the carburetor.
          When I pull the plunger up and say,
          "let go" I want you to let go and
          inhale hard.
          Joel's POV: Looking down the barrel of the three-foot bong
          with macho-man Willie holding the lighter at the bowl.

<b>                         WILLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Okay exhale!

<b>                         JOEL

</b>          (starting to get scary)
          Bullshit! EXHALE HARD!
          Mostly out of fear, Joel exhales. Willie puts the bong up to
          Joel's face, lights it and starts lifting the plunger. Then
          pushes it down.

<b>                         WILLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Let go! Inhale! NOW!
          Joel lets go of the carburator, inhales.

          of thick pot smoke as Willie pushes down the plunger.

</b>          Huh?
          Joel's POV: looking from Dean to Willie. Willie sits there
          with red eyes barely open. Willie turns slowly to Joel.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Oh, I thought somebody said
          something.
          Willie looks at Joel, stone-faced, adding even further to
          Joel's paranoia. He stares at Joel for a long beat. Then,
          in an instant, he's right up in Joel's face.

</b>
<b>          BWAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!
</b>          Joel jumps back, scared shitless. Willie starts laughing his

</b>          Willie grabs the piece of paper with Cindy's number. He
          looks at it, starts to dial, then pauses, realizing
          something.
          Willie looks up at Joel, with slowly building rage, then
          hangs up the phone.

</b>          I'll tell you why you're getting a

</b>          Oh... You're joking right? Trying
          to make me paranoid?
          Joel waits for Willie to start cracking up. He doesn't. He
          just continues glaring at Joel. We hear the FRONT DOOR
          UNLOCK. Everyone looks.
          CINDY enters.

</b>          Joel? What are you doing here...?
          Willie stands up and walks over to Joel's chair. Dean
          suddenly stands up.

</b>          Well, it looks like you guys got a

          off. Later guys.
          Dean bolts. Willie moves in closer on Joel. Joel starts to
          leave, but Willie blocks him.

</b>          Kinda slutty?
          Willie grabs Joel and throws him against the wall. Joel
          tries to make a break for the door, but Willie hauls off and
          punches him across the face. The ass-kicking begins as we

           from the ass-kicking. He looks awful.
           As he limps into the bedroom as quietly as possible, he trips
           on something, waking up Suzie. She turns on a light and sees
          Joel.

</b>          No. Don't fire him. Just trust me

</b>          Shit!

</b>          Hi.
          Joel walks over to the sliding glass door, looks outside at
          the pool. It's filthy.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          So how was that new pool cleaner?
           Suzie is caught off guard -- wonders if she's busted -- but
          she plays it cool.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          Um... What do you mean?

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          What do you think I mean?... Did
          he do a good job cleaning the pool?

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          Ah... well--

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Did he get all the... leaves? It
          doesn't really look that clean. I
          mean I'm looking at it, and I'd say
          it's pretty goddamn filthy. Did the
          guy even clean it at all? It sure
          doesn't look like it.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>
<b>                         (NERVOUS)
</b>          Well yeah, I guess he didn't do a
          very good job.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          I think he did a horrible job. I
          don't think we should use him
          anymore.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          Okay.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Okay.
          Suzie watches Joel leave, a slight look of guilt on her face.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          Are you all right, Joel? You want
          an aspirin or anything?

           In a WIDE SHOT we see Joel's car is parked on the street. He
           walks up and rings the doorbell. We see Step answer, talk to
          him and then invite him in.

          Step and Joel enter. Step's 300 POUND HALF-BROTHER sits on a
          ratty couch watching TV, drinking a huge plastic bottle of
          Pepsi. He looks like he's been sitting there for years. The
          TV is deafeningly loud.

<b>                         STEP
</b>          Wow, I don't think you've ever been

          remembered...

</b>          This is my half brother Phil.
          Joel starts to motion "don't get up," then realizes that's
          not happening anyway. Phil nods.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Hi... Hey Step, can we talk in
          another room.

<b>                         STEP
</b>          Yes sir. She's my girlfriend. We
          might even get married after all
          this lawsuit-settlement stuff gets
          worked out.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          .so some of the guys at work are
          saying you gave Cindy that black

<b>                         STEP
</b>          What? That ain't true at all.

          embarrassed, you know? You don't
          tell a girl you just met that you
          lost one of your balls. Especially
          a girl as hot as Cindy.

<b>                         (DELICATELY)
</b>          You know she lives with this guy
          Willie right?

<b>                         STEP
</b>          That's her ex. She broke up with
          him. She's gonna move out. She
          just needs to get all her stuff
          outta there.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          You sure about that?

<b>                         STEP
</b>          Oh yeah. She's moving in with me.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Oh. Hmm...

<b>                         STEP
</b>          Look, I know Cindy's got some
          problems, but she means well.
          She's the best thing that ever
          happened to me.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Well, okay... If you say so.
          Another thing -- you just might
          want to watch your back. Some of
          the guys at work who think you gave
          Cindy the black eye were talking
          about paying you a visit -- you
          know, getting even.

<b>                         STEP
</b>          Oh. Well I'm not worried about
          that.
          (dead-serious, proud)
          I could kick anyone's ass at that

          This was all a big mistake. I'm

          want to make my marriage work

          with his hair pulled back in a pony tail.)

<b>                         ADLER
</b>          .You see, if both his balls had
          been knocked clean off, he would be
          a good case, but not a great case:
          A man with no balls is no man at
          all. He's a freak. He's barely
          human. He's gross. And a jury will

          Gemco like that. At Gemco, all the
          employees are owners -- even says

          The meeting is already in progress. On Adler's side of the
          table are two other lawyers and a couple of paralegals. On
          Joel's side it's just he, Brian and Joel's secretary. Maybe
          one lawyer who doesn't say much.
          Everybody has in front of them a small stack of documents.
          The confrence room, like Joel's office, has a full length
          window facing the manufacturing area.

</b>          Ok gentlemen. We've gone through
          everything and the only way we
          would even begin to consider a
          settlement would be to the tune of
          the number you see on the bottom of
          page 18. Does everyone have this?
           Joel and the rest of them find page 18. Joel is stunned by
          the number.

          Adler jumps up, dripping with phoney, forced indignation.

</b>          How about what my client gave up!?
          His testicles! How about that!?
          He walks over to the door...

          Employees POV: Adler pointing at his balls, pointing to the
          door again, about to slam it. One of his lawyers stops him.

          Joel's in no mood for this. He goes off on them.

          Joel storms out, leaving the employees standing there.
          A BICKERING MATCH erupts over who was supposed to do the
          talking, who said they would say what, who backed down first,
          etc. "I was gonna say something but you interrupted," "You
          didn't say anything when he was leaving, so I thought you
          were quitting. I would've stood up to him."
          As the argument dies down, one by one they all go back to

          stressed, sexually frustrated and I

          Joel sits at the bar, drowning his sorrows. Dean is over by
          the cash register, tending to some business. Brad enters,
          walks over to Joel. Joel looks the other way.

<b>                         BRAD

</b>          I couldn't kick your ass if I

          Brian sits with Joel. They both look pretty miserable.
          Brian looks down at some papers, shaking his head.

<b>                         BRIAN
</b>          We're screwed. General Mills has

          Not only do we not sell the

          Suzie is trying to clean the pool herself, struggling with
          the long pole with the net at the end. She looks miserable.

</b>

</b>          Shit...
          Nathan walks over to Suzie. She's in no mood for this. She
          acts as unfriendly as possible.

<b>                         NATHAN
</b>          Why are you cleaning the pool

</b>          Yeah.

<b>                         NATHAN
</b>          So, did you get a chance to write
          that check?

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          Look Nathan, Joel and I aren't
          going to that dinner okay?
          Nathan acts deeply disappointed.

<b>                         NATHAN
</b>          Well gee, I wish you would've told
          me that before I went and bought
          the tickets.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          Joel never agreed to this Nathan,
          and neither did I.

<b>                         NATHAN
</b>          Well, it sure sounded like you guys
          were going. Leslie was gonna talk
          to you about it, but you didn't
          return our calls. I mean, I
          already bought these tickets.
          They're nonrefundable. I really
          wish you guys had been a little
          more clear with me...
          It's the last straw. Suzie has had enough. She unleashes
          all her pent-up aggression on Nathan.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          Okay, let me be really clear with
          you then. When we say "I don't
          think so," or even "I'm not sure,"
          that means "no." Why can't you
          understand that?

          more clear with you. We don't like
          you! Is that clear enough? You're
          dull, you never shut up, you never
          listen, and we don't want anything
          to do with you ever again!
          Nathan freezes, in some kind of state of shock. He starts to
          shake a little. Suzie just keeps going -- it feels too good
          to stop.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          Is that clear enough for you
          Nathan?! Is that...?
          Nathan starts to go into some kind of seizure.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>
<b>                         (WORRIED)

          Nathan's eyes roll back into his head, and he collapses.
          Suzie SCREAMS.

</b>          No. It probably just looks like

          her eyes well up, about to cry, but Joel doesn't notice.

<b>                         (COMPOSES HIMSELF)

          Joel picks up the purse.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          And I'm taking this purse with me.
          If it really is yours, you can call
          the police and tell 'em I stole
          it... In fact, I'm gonna call the
          police and report it...
          Joel walks towards the door. Then Cindy slumps down on the
          couch, mutters something, still looking down at the floor,
          her voice cracking slightly.

<b>                         CINDY
</b>          Please don't...
          Joel stops.

          Please don't report it to the

          to jail. For a long time.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Well... Maybe you should've thought
          about that before you started
          ripping off my employees.
          Joel starts to open the door.

<b>                         CINDY
</b>          Joel? Please? I'll leave Step
          alone. I promise. He'll drop the
          lawsuit.
          Joel considers this.

</b>          How do I know that?

<b>                         CINDY
</b>          You can keep the purse. If I don't
          leave him alone; if he doesn't drop
          the lawsuit, then you can report
          me. Please?
          Beat.

</b>          Hmm... I guess that ah... Do you
          have Sylvia's wallet, and Jim's
          watch? Can I get those too?
          Beat. Cindy nods, still looking down. Joel considers it.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Well... Okay then. I guess that
          works.

<b>                         (REALIZING)

          you stole the purse. That's good,
          I guess... A step in the right
          direction...
          Joel sits down on the couch also. With her head still down,
          Cindy is weeping quietly. Joel doesn't notice, looking
          straight ahead.

</b>          So what's your deal anyway?... I
          mean, how did you end up like this?
          Joel finally looks over, notices that she's crying. He's
          caught off guard.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          .Ah... Cindy?
          Cindy breaks down and starts bawling.

<b>                         JOEL (CONT'D)
</b>          Okay, now you see... that's what
          I'm talking about. You're trying
          to manipulate me now, and I'm not
          gonna fall for it...
          Cindy starts bawling even harder.

<b>                         JOEL (CONT'D)
</b>          I really hope you're not faking
          this right now, because I'm feeling
          really bad. Are you faking it?
          Cindy shakes her head "no."

</b>          I'm sorry, I was just curious, you
          know, how a person ends up like...
          this...
          Cindy suddenly starts BAWLING hysterically.
          Joel stands there awkwardly, not sure if he should hug her or
          comfort her in any way.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Never mind. I'm sorry...
          Joel tentatively puts a comforting arm around her and she
          leans in to him, crying on his chest.
          He puts his other arm around her and she snuggles in even
          closer. As her crying gradually subsides she snuggles in
          even more. Finally, she lifts her head and they start
          kissing. As they get hot and heavy we

          Joel wakes up, looking more relaxed than we've ever seen him.
          We PULL OUT to reveal that he's alone in Cindy's bed. He
          sits up, yawns. He has a big satisfied smile on his face.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Cindy?
          He looks around, realizes he's alone. Then suddenly looks
          worried.

<b>                         JOEL (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh shit!
          He scrambles for his pants, then looks relieved as he
          realizes his wallet is still there. He sets down the pants,
          then after a beat, picks them up again, checks inside the
          wallet and sees there's still cash and credit cards. Then he
          looks up at the chest of drawers and sees: Mary's purse,
          Sylvia's wallet, and a watch, placed side by side.
          He lies back in bed, and shuts his eyes, grinning again.

          walks over to Mary carrying her PURSE.

          how to react, not ever wanting to appear grateful for
          anything -- not in her nature.

          building this company, dreaming
          about the day I could sell it and
          retire, but what would I really do
          if I retired? It's like that old
          saying -- it's not about the

          somewhere and you get an auto-

          can come up to my office any time
          you have a problem. Thanks.

<b>          103.
</b>
<b>                         JOEL
</b>          I heard you were right there when
          it happened. That must've been
          rough.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          It was horrible Joel. He came over
          to ask for that check, and I
          just...
          Suzie breaks down, starts CRYING.

<b>                         SUZIE (CONT'D)
</b>          .I just lost it. I started
          yelling at him. I said horrible
          things. He had an aneurism and I
          probably caused it.

<b>                         (CRYING UNCONTROLLABLY)
</b>          I think the last thing I said to
          him was "shut up." Those were the
          last words he heard.
          Joel hugs her, consoling.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          It's okay, it's not your fault...
          It's not your fault.
          Suzie's crying subsides a little.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          It could happen to any of us Joel.
          Any of us could have an aneurism.
          We could die at any moment.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Yeah, I know... I know... But we
          probably won't. It'll be alright.
          Suzie starts to regain her composure.
          They stand there for a beat.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          You wanna go get something to
          eat... or something?
          Beat. Suzie still sniffling a little.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          Yeah, okay. Sure.

<b>

<b>

</b>
<b>          104.
</b>          They walk off towards the cemetery gates. After a while,
          Joel hands Suzie a Kleenex.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Here...

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          Thanks.
          They walk a little further. Joel looks at the Chapel nearby.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Maybe we should've been married in
          a Church like that one. Instead of
          the Botanical Gardens.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          I thought you liked the Botanical
          Gardens?

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Yeah, but... a church just seems
          more -- I don't know -- official.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          You think it would've made a
          difference?

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          I don't know... So, are we still
          married?

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          Well, legally yes.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          I mean otherwise.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          Hmmm... We can talk about it I
          suppose.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Alright.
          They walk for a beat.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          You know, this is really bad,
          but... Oh never mind.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          What?

<b>                         
</b>
<b>

<b>

<b>                         
</b>
<b>          105.
</b>
<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Well, as I was looking down at
          Nathan there, I was thinking...
          That's the longest I've ever seen
          him with his mouth shut.
          Suzie LAUGHS in spite of herself.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          Joel!
          They walk off into the distance as we

<b>          FADE OUT.
