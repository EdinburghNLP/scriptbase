Ray - 
So the boy and girl are making out right? When they hear over the radio that

hook for a hand. 

Barry - 
No, you're telling it wrong. 

Ray - 
Shut Up! So the girl, she gets all scared right? And the boy, all hot and 
bothered, he gets pissed and peels out. 

Barry - 
No, no, no no. That's not the way it goes, okay the boy goes for help and the 
girl stays in the car and she hears this scratching sound... 

Helen (interupting) - 
It's not a scratching sound, it's a drip, drip, drip. 

Barry - 
No. its scartching because the guys been hung from a tree limb and his feet are 
scratching on the roof of the car. 

Helen - 
No, he's been decapitated and it's the blood for his severed neck that's 
dripping on the car going drip, drip, drip. 

Julie - 
No he wasn't decapitated, he was gutted with a hook. That's the way I heard it. 

Ray - 
You're all wrong, they get back to the girls house and find the lunatics bloody 
hook in the car door. Now that's the original story, that's the way it really 
happened. 

Barry - 
Hey, hey none of it really happened, it's a bullshit ghost story to begin with . 

Ray - 
No it's not, it's true. 

Helen - 
Yeah I don't think so Ray 

Ray - 
I swear it. 

Julie - 
Please, it's a fictional story created to warn young girls of the dangers of 
having premarital sex. 

Ray - 
Well actually honey, you know how terrified I am of your IQ but it's an urban 
legend, american folklore and they all usually originate from some real life 
incident. 

Ray smiles. 

Some time has passed on the beach and Helen is running around while Barry is 
laying on the ground. 

Helen - 
So by that time, I will just be finishing my two year contract on Guiding Light, 
coinciding with your first year as starting quaterback for the steelers... 

Barry - 
Cowboys! 

Helen - 
Whatever. Then we can elope in Europe or the Caymans or wherever where I will 
let you impregnate me with the first of thrre children, before you head off to 
rehab and then we can live hapily... 

Another part of the beach. Julie is walking alone on the beach calling out for 
Ray. 

Ray (running behind her) - 
I'm gonna hook you!! 

Julie - 
Hey Ray you don't really believe all that crap do you? 

Ray - 
That's true. 

Julie - 
Please, it's really a phallic symbol. 

Ray - 
Oh really? 

Julie - 
Yeah ultimatly castrated. God I'm gonna miss you. 

They sit down on the sand. 

Ray - 
You don't have to, you can always ditch this Boston thing and come to New York 
with me. 

Julie - 
Yeah well we can't all sit in the village coffee house and ramble esoterically 
on our laptops. There just isn't enough room. 

Ray - 
See, no one gets me the way you do. 

Julie - 
I understand your pain 

Ray - 
Precisely. 

Julie - 
I hate this. I really hate this. You're gonna go off and fall for some head 
shaving-black wearing-tattoo covered-body peircing philosophy student. 

Ray - 
That sounds attractive. 

Julie - 
And I'll never see you again. 

Ray - 
Hey, did you know the success rate of high school sweetheart realationships is 
higher than any other type of relationship? 

Julie - 
Yeah? Name your source. 

Ray then puts his hand on his heart. Julie begins to remove her jacket. 

Ray - 
Are you sure? 

Julie nods yes. Music comes up and the two begin to kiss as they lay on the 
ground. 

Cut to - Helen and Barry at Barry's car. Barry wan't the keys to his car. 

Helen -

Helen tosses the keys to Ray. 

Barry -

INT. Barry's car. --- Ray is driving, Julie is in the passanger seat and Barry 
and Helen are in the back seat making out. The car shifts and Barry sits up. 

Barry - You can't drive for shit you know that? 

Julie (to Barry) - 
Can you say Al-co-hol-ic??? 

Sappy music is playing on the radio. 

Barry - 
What the hell is this crap? 

Barry then puts on some thrash music and climbs out the sunroof while swilling 
back the booze and screaming. Barry then drops his bottle on Ray and the car 
starts to slide. 

Julie - 
You asshole. 

Ray - 
What's wrong with you? 

Barry - 
WATCH OUT!!!!!!! 

The car hits something hard and skids off the road. 

Helen - 
What was that? 

Ray - 
I don't know. 

Julie - 
Is everybody okay? 

Helen - 
Yeah 

Ray - 
Maybe it was an animal 

Barry comes down through the sunroof. 

Helen - 
Oh my god you're bleeding. 

Barry wipes the blood of his face. 

Barry - 
It's not mine. 

Ray - 
It must have been a dog or something. 

Barry (screaming) - 
Jesus Christ, my fuckin' car. 

They all hop out and look at the smashed up car. 

Barry - 
Fuck! Can't you see where you're going?? 

Ray - 
Look, it came out of nowhere, I didn't see it. 

Julie - 
A dog couldn't have done that. 

Barry - 
Yeah well a fucking deer could. 

Ray - 
You dropped your bottle, I was just... 

Barry (interupting) - 
My dad is gonna freak on my ass. 

Helen - 
It was an accident leave him alone. 

Julie - 
Where is it? If it was a deer then where is it?? 

Ray - 
Maybe it ran off. 

Helen - 
I hope so, I hope we didn't kill it. 

Barry - 
Fuck that. Lets go. 

Julie sees a mans boot on the side on the road with blood on it. 

Julie - 
Oh my god. 

She runs and picks it up. 

Ray - 
No way. 

Julie - 
Oh my god. 

Helen - 
But I thought... 

Ray - 
I didn't see it. 

Barry - 
No there's no way. 

Julie - 
Oh my god this isn't happening. 

Barry runs and gets some flashlights out of the trunk of the car. They begin 
looking. 

Barry - 
You check that side. 

Ray - 
Yeah. 

Barry - 
Come on Helen. 

Julie screams in horror, there is a body laying on the side of the road. 

Ray - 
I couldn't see him, I swear. 

Helen - 
Is he dead.? 

Ray - 
I don't know 

Barry - 
Check his pulse. 

Ray - 
No way 

Barry - 
You're the one who rammed him. 

Julie - 
Just do it. 

Ray goes towards the body and checks his pulse. 

Ray - 
I think he's dead. 

Barry - 
SHIT....FUCK!!! 

Helen - 
Who is he? 

Ray - I can't tell, his face is all messed up. 

Barry - 
What the hell was he doing out here? 

Julie - 
We've got to call the police and get an ambulance out here. 

Barry - 
Hey hey what's your hurry? The guys dead. 

Julie - 
You're not a doctor you don't make that descison. 

Barry - 
Use your brain Julie, we call the police and were fucked. 

Julie - 
It was an accident. 

Ray - 
Look, lets think about this a minute. 

Julie - 
Think about what? Think about what? He was crossing the road in the middle of 
the night okay it was an accident, you weren't drinking or speeding. 

Ray - 
There's liquor all over the car. 

Julie - 
But you're sober. 

Ray - 
They will never believe I was driving. 

Barry - 
It's my car, they'll nail my ass. 

Helen - 
That's not true. 

Barry - 
Are you kidding? Look at me, I'm drunk as shit, I'm fucked. 

Helen - 
So we'll call the police, just tell them the truth, they'll believe us. 

Ray - 
It's manslaughter. We're gonna fry no matter who takes the fall. 

Barry - 
Then we leave right now. 

Julie - 
No way are you crazy? 

Ray - 
The grills busted, there's blood everywhere. 

Barry - 
We can clean it up, come on. 

Julie - 
Listen to yourselves, NO we are going to the police. 

Barry (still screaming) - 
We don't have time for your shit, you understand? we've got to move fast. 

Ray - 
Hey, now lets try to stay calm. Focus. 

Julie - 
Don't you get it? If there's some of him on the car, there's some of the car on 
him, their gonna trace it back to you, you're looking at a hit and run. 

Barry - 
Then we dump the body. 

Julie - 
You've lost it. 

Helen - 
Like just pretend we were never here. 

Barry - 
We could drag him into the water and dump him in, they wouldn't find the fucker 
for weeks by that time all the evidence would be washed away. 

Ray - 
If they found him at all... The currents are strong, the undertow could carry 
him out to sea. 

Julie - 
I won't be any part of it. 

Ray - 
Look I'm scared Julie, I'm not like the rest of you, I don't have the family or 
the money to get me out of this. Please. 

Barry - 
This is your future Julie, think about it, college, your schloarship. The guy's 
already dead, if we go to the police we're dead too. 

A truck starts coming down the road towards them. 

Barry - 
Fuck. 

Helen - 
What do we do? 

Barry (to Ray) - 
Help me. 

Barry and Ray pick up the body and carry him over to the other side of the 
guardrail. 

Helen - 
Shit, they're slowing down. Who is it? 

Julie - 
It's Max. 

Barry - 
Get rid of him. 

Max stops the truck. 

Max - 
Julie? What you got car trouble? 

Max and Julie look over to the guardrail where Barry is pretedning he is 
vomiting. 

Julie - 
Actually, it's barry, he's had way too much to drink and were trying to keep the 
up-chuck out of the new car. 

Max looks back at the smashed up car. 

Max - 
Doesn't look so new anymore 

Julie - 
Yeah, don't drink and drive. 

Max - 
Daddy's gonna be mad. 

Ray comes over to the truck. 

Ray - 
What can I do for you Max? 

Max - 
You can wipe that "my shit don't stink grin off your face". 

Ray - 
Okay Max, will do. Have a goodnight. 

Max - 
You almost got that rich boy act down Ray. 

Ray - 
We'll be seeing you Max. 

Max - 
Yup. Take care Julie. 

Max drives away. 

EXT. Down at the docks. --- Barrys car is arriving, they get out and open the 
trunk and Barry and Ray start dragging the body down to the water. 

Barry - 
Even if his body washes ashore in the next couple of weeks, he'll be eaten by 
crabs and small fish. Maybe we'll get lucky with a shark. Take him to the side. 

they start to lower him on to the side of the wharf. 

Barry - 
Put him down. 

Ray - 
Easy, that's it. 

Barry - 
Lets do it. 

Julie - 
Wait. 

Ray - 
What? 

Julie - 
Should we check his wallet and see who he is? 

Barry - 
Why? 

Julie - 
I don't know okay, just to know. 

Helen - 
I don't want to know. 

Barry - 
Let's just pretend he's some escaped lunatic with a hook for a hand and we're 
doing everybody a favor. Ray help me. 

Ray - 
I don't think I can Barry. 

Barry - 
Shit, we agreed 

Julie - 
God, come on Barry it's not too late. 

Barry (screaming) - 
You, shut up just shut up. 

Helen (wanting to get it over with) - 
Christ already I'll do it. 

Helen and Barry start to move the body towards the water when all of the sudden 
the man wakes up and grabs Helens crown, they all scream and push him in the 
water. 

Helen (Hystrical) - 
My crown, he's got my crown. 

Barry jumps in the water after the crown and swims to the bottom where the man 
has landed with the crown in his hand. Barry reaches for it and as his hands 
touches the crown the mans eyes pop open and Barry beats the crown away from him 
while screaming his head off and swims back to the top leaving the man 
underwater. 

Ray - 
Over here. 

Barry slams the crown to Helen and walks towards the car. 

Ray - 
Let's get out of here. 

Barry - 
We're going home now and never, ever, under any circumstances known to God speak 
about this again is that clear? It is now mearly a futural therapy bill agreed? 

Barry (Screaming) - 
Helen?? 

Helen - 
I'll never mention it again. 

Barry - 
We make a pact, right here and now we take this to our grave. 

Ray - 
Agreed. 

Barry - 
Julie? 

Julie nods her head in agreement. 

Barry (livid) - 
Don't you nod your head you fuckin say it. 

Julie (somber) - 
Yeah okay. 

Barry runs and grabs Julie by the neck pushing her against the car. 

Barry - 
We take this to our grave, let me hear it. 

Ray - 
Let her go Barry. 

Barry - 
you fucking say it! 

Julie - 
Okay Barry, we take this to the grave. 

Barry gets in the car wet and furious. 

Ray (to Julie) - 
It will be okay. 

Julie begins to cry. And they all get in the car and leave. Camera pans in on 
the ground where a silver medallion that says "I love you" is laying. 

ONE YEAR LATER

EXT. Julies college. --- Students are running around on campus. 

INT. Julies dormroom. --- Julies roommate Deb walks in. 

Deb - 
Yo, it's time to go. 

Julie turns around from her computer revealing that the last year has sure taken 
its toll on her. 

Deb - 
Come on, move your tired ugly ass girl we're late. 

Julie - 
I changed my mind, I'm not going. 

Deb - 
Julie, get your white as death, chalky corpse in the car now. 

Pause. 

Deb - 
I said come on. Julie you're going home for the summer and you're going to get a 
tan on that pasty pale tail of yours. 

They both giggle. 

Deb - 
Let's go. 

EXT. - Julies house - Deb is pulling the car into the driveway. Julie takes her 
bag from the backseat. 

Deb - 
Remember, sun and fun. 

Julie - 
Yeah. 

Deb drives off leaving Julie home, where she doesn't want to be. 

Mrs. James - 
Julie? Welcome home dear. 

Julie turns around to see her mother who she hasn't seen since last summer. 

Mrs. James - 
I missed you. 

INT. - Julies Kitchen - Julie and her mother are eating. 

Mrs. James - 
How's the snapper? 

Julie just fakes a smile. 

Mrs. James - 
I really wanted monkfish but it's been a bad season. 

Julie sits stonefaced. 

Mrs- James - 
Are you on drugs? 

Julie is surprised by the question. 

Julie - 
What? 

Mrs. James - 
I just wanted to surprise you, I want an honest reaction. 

Julie - 
No. No mom no drugs. 

Mrs. James - 
Well than what is wrong? I mean you look like death. 

Julie - 
Yeah well I've had a rough year. 

Julies mom clears the table and Julie gets up and walks towards the living room 
looking at old awards and pictures of her father. Julies mother walks in. 

Mrs. James - 
You got some mail, a letter came today, not your report card though, that came 
last week. 

Julie - 
Mom I know it looks bad but the summer session went really well. 

Mrs. James - 
Well it would have to because acording to the dean you only have one more 
chance. 

Julie - 
It's not that serious really. 

Mrs. James - 
What happened to my daughter? I mean you went away and you don't call and you 
don't visit. 

Mrs. James begins to walk out of the room. 

Mrs. James - 
Your father must be turning over in his grave. 

Julie begins to cry as she opens the plainly marked envelope so see the words 
written boldy in black marker "I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER" she looks at it 
terrified as she begins to cry harder. 

Julie (Holding back the tears) - 
Who sent this? There's no postmark or return address. 

Mrs. James - 
Your guess is as good as mine why what does it say? 

Julie - 
Nothing. 

Julie runs up the stairs to her bedroom. She sits on a sofa looking at the 
letter all night long wondering who 
could have sent it. She hears a noise outside and runs to shut her window and 
curtains. She is scared. 

EXT. - The streets of southport --- Julies car drives up to the store named 
Shivers. 

INT. - Shivers --- Back entrance Elsa is talking to some guys unloading 
merchandise. A man drops one of the boxes. 

Elsa - 
Guys, easy. It's called glass, it breaks. 

She walks into the main part of the store greeting some shoppers and begins to 
arrange some things. Julie walks into the store. 

Elsa - 
Well well look what the cat drug in. 

Julie - 
Elsa, hi. You know what? I need to talk to Helen and I was wondering if you 
could give me her New York number? 

Elsa - 
Her New York number? 

Julie - 
Yeah I need to talk to her. 

Elsa - 
Fact check Julie, Helen doesn't have a New York number, if you need to speak to 
her I suggest you go to womens fragrances, 10 feet to your left. 

Camera pans off to show Helen who is arranging some bottles of perfume. 

Elsa - 
Frightning isn't it? 

Helen looks up and sees the friend that she hasn't seen in a year and smiles. 

Helen - 
Julie? 

Julie walks over to her. 

Helen - 
When did you get home? 

Julie - 
Yesterday. 

Helen - 
It's good to see you. 

Julie - 
What happened to New York. 

Helen - 
I went for a while and it didn't really work out. 

Julie pulls the letter from her pocket. 

Julie - 
Somebody sent this to me. 

A look of fear crosses Helens face. 

Helen - 
Oh my God. 

Julie - 
Somebody knows Helen. 

Helen - 
How? 

Julie - 
I don't know. 

Helen - 
Julie we were so carefull. 

Julie - 
Were we? Were we? What if somebody saw us? What if somebody else was there that 
night? 

Helen - 
Who? It's been a year. 

Julie - 
I don't know. 

Helen - 
Has Barry seen this? 

EXT. - Barrys lawn --- Helen and Julie are walking towards the house. 

Helen - 
Do you ever see Barry at school? 

Julie - 
It's a big campus. Are you sure he came back? 

Helen - 
Saw his car the other day at the gym. 

Julie - 
Did you guys break up? 

Barry walks out on to the patio not pleased at seeing the two of them again. 

Barry (not excited to see them)- 
Hey. What are you two doing here? 

Helen - 
Hi Bare. 

EXT. - Barrys patio --- they are discussing the letter. 

Barry - 
This is nothing. I know what you did last summer? Oooh, what a crock of shit. 

Helen - 
We need help. 

Barry - 
Yeah I'll say, you know what? You guys should check out a mirror once and a 
while, you two look like shit run over twice. 

Helen - 
You're a prick. 

Julie - 
We can't just ignore it. 

Barry - 
Come one Julie, how do you know this is even related? You did a lot of things 
last summer. 

Julie - 
Yeah well only one murder comes to mind. 

Barry is extremly pissed that she mentions that night again. 

Barry - 
You shut the hell up! We didn't murder anyone. 

Julie - 
He was still alive when we dumped him in the water. 

Helen - 
Do we have to rehash this? It was an accident, the guy was in the middle of the 
road. 

Julie - 
His name was David Egan. 

Barry - 
Who? 

Julie - 
David Egan. He was found three weeks after we.... his body was caught in a 
shrimp net not far from millers dock. It was in the paper, I think the police 
called it an accidental drowning. You can call it an accident all you want but 
he died because of us that's certain. 

Barry - 
What about Ray? Have you showed this letter to him? What does he think? 

Julie - 
I haven't seen Ray since last summer, we broke up and last I heard he was 
working up north. 

Barry - 
Okay let's supposed someone was there that night, why send the letter one year 
later? Probably some crack fucking around....Max. 

Julie - 
Max? You think? 

Barry - 
Who else? He was there. 

EXT. - Fish Plant --- Julie, Helen and Barry are walking towards the building. 

Barry - 
You two wait here. 

Julie - 
What are you gonna do? 

Barry - 
I know what I'm doing. 

INT. - Fish Plant --- Max is working with some lobster pots. He notices Barry 
walking in. 

Max - 
Well go figure, I was just thinking to myself what ever happened to that Barry 
Cox? 

Barry (being very polite) - 
Hey Max. Hey listen can we talk for a sec? In private? 

Max - 
Oh what this isn't private enough for you? 

Barry smirks and walks out back and Max follows him. 

Max - 
Yeah what? 

Barry then grabs Max and pushes him into a block of ice holding him down. 

Barry - 
Look you shit we got your little letter. 

Max - 
What the hell are you talking about? 

Barry - 
Don't fuck with me Max, you saw us that night. 

Max - 
What the fuck are you on huh? 

Barry grabs a large fish hook that was sitting on a block of ice and holds it up 
to Maxs face. 

Max - 
Jesus Christ. 

Barry - 
Listen I'm gonna say this once, I'll fucking kill your ass, I got no problem 
with that... 

Max - 
Oh get the fuck off me. 

Barry - 
You understand me? 

Max - 
Get off of me. 

Max struggles with Barry and Barry cuts Max's arm with the hook and then walks 
away putting the hook back where he got it from. Max is laying on the floor 
wondering what just happened. He gets up and he is angry and grabs the hook 
yelling at Barry who is leaving. 

Max - 
Mother fucker. Don't you test me mother fucker, I'll call the cops on your 
college quaterback ass. 

EXT. - Back on the street --- Barry is walking out where Julie and Helen have 
been waiting. 

Julie - 
So did he admit to the letter? 

Barry keeps walking. 

Barry - 
He won't bother you anymore. 

Helen - 
What did you do? 

Barry - 
I took care of it okay? 

Julie - 
How? 

Barry - 
I scared the shit out of him alright? 

Stepping up from out of a boat is Ray. The old group of friends are reunited. 

Barry - 
Well I'll be damned. 

Ray (to Julie) - 
Hi. 

Barry - 
So Ray grew up to be a fisherman huh? 

Ray - 
Yeah, almost a year now, I work on that one over there on the end. 

Barry does not look where Ray has just pointed. 

Barry - 
That's nice. Have a nice life guys, I'm out of here. 

Barry leaves. 

Ray (to Julie) - 
You got a minute? 

Helen doesn't want to be intrude. 

Helen - 
I gotta get back to work, call me, we can get togeather. 

Julie - 
Yeah okay. 

Helen leaves Ray and Julie alone to talk. 

Julie - 
We need to talk. 

INT. - Fish Plant --- Ray and Julie are walking in discussing the letter. 

Ray - 
You think Max sent it? 

Julie - 
Barry does. I don't know. 

Ray - 
Well, you know how Max feels about you guys, look he's probably just screwing 
around, he doesn't have much else to do you know? 

Julie - 
Yeah maybe. 

EXT. - On the wharf --- Ray and Julie are talking while he is working. 

Ray - 
So, how's school? 

Julie - 
So you're a fisherman? 

Ray - 
Yeah prophecy fullfilled right? I've become my father. 

Julie - 
I thought you didn't know your dad? 

Ray - 
Ah he worked the boats, that's all I do know about him. 

Pause. 

Ray - 
Look I thought a lot about last summer, I know you hold me responsible for what 
happened. 

Julie - 
I don't hold you responsible, no I'm responsible for my own actions and I don't 
blame you. But I don't want to know you either. 

She runs away from a confused Ray leaving him there all alone. 

INT. - Fish Plant - Max is cooking lobsters. he burns his finger and goes to get 
gloves. He sees a shadow through the steam from the boiling water and looks 
closer to see what it is and sees someone in a black slicker coming towards him 
and then the hook goes through his throat and dragging him across the table. 

EXT - SouthPort street --- Barry is pulling up to the South Port Muscle. 

INT. - Southport Muscle. --- Barry is working out, punching and kickboxing. 

INT. - Locker Room --- Barry is taking tape off his hands and sees a shadow. 

Barry - 
Hello?? 

INT. - Shower --- Barry is showering after his workout, he sees a shadow go past 
the door. 

Barry - 
Hello??? 

INT. - Locker Room --- Barry sees a ploaroid picture sticking out of his locker, 
he looks at it, it's a picture of his car which is parked outside with "I Know" 
written on the picture. He looks in his locked and his jacket is missing. 

Barry - 
My fucking jacket. 

He quickly gets dressed and runs out into the lobby where an old man working is 
reading the newspaper. 

Barry - 
Who else is here? anybody else working out? 

Worker - 
Just you and me pal. 

Barry runs outdoor to see his car is being backed out of the parking lot, he 
chases after it. 

Barry - 
Hey! Hey! Fucker. 

The car back into the end of the street with Barry chasing it, the car stops, 
Barry is looking directly at it. 

Barry - 
Max, you're fucking dead. 

The headlights of the car come on and starts speeding towards Barry, he starts 
to run away but the car is right behind him. He is backed up against an old 
deserted building with nowhere to go, he is looking at the car trying to think 
of something to do, the car pauses and then rams into Barry who flips up onto 
the windsheild and the car pushes him through the building. The car stops and 
someone in a slicker gets out and is looking down at an injured Barry. Barry is 
screaming for help. 

Barry - 
Help me!!! help me!! somebody. What do you want???? 

The slicker-clad madman pulls out a big fishing hook. 

Barry - 
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I swear we didn't mean it , please don't. 

Screen fades to black. 

INT. - Southport hospital - Julie is getting off the elevator and sees Ray. 

INT. - Barrys hospital room - the four former friends are all in there talking 
about what just happened. 

Barry - 
No for the fortieth fucking time I couldn't see his face. 

Julie - 
We have no choice here okay? Somebody tried to kill you last night, we have to 
go to the police. 

Barry - 
No he wasn't trying to kill me last night, if he wanted me dead he could've done 
it, he's just fucking with us. 

Helen - 
Who is? 

Barry - 
I don't know, some guy in a slicker. 

Ray - 
Well that narrows it down, this being a quaint little fishing village and all. 

Barry - 
Since you bring it up, we all know you have a slicker. 

Ray - 
You are not going to throw this on me. 

Helen - 
Come on you guys please don't do this. 

Julie - 
This isn't getting us anywhere. 

Ray - 
Look, maybe we should just come clean. 

Barry - 
No. No. We made a pact and we're keep it. 

Julie - 
Yeah but this is insane now Barry look at us, this secret's killing us. 

Barry - 
I'm not going to the police and you're not either. 

Julie - 
Barry please, we could put an end to it and maybe salvage some small fraction of 
a life. 

Barry - 
And how do we do that? Huh? There was no accident Julie it was murder, your 
words remember? Murder. I say we find the fuck who's doing this and have a 
little one on one. 

Ray - 
What like last night Bare? 

Barry jumps to a sitting position in his bed. 

Barry - 
Fuck you man. 

Helen - 
No Barry's right, whosever doing this isn't going to the police, we could this 
guy, talk to him. 

Barry - 
How do we find him? 

Helen - 
Well it's got to be a friend or a family member of the guy we hit. What was his 
name?? 

Julie - 
David Egan. 

Helen - 
Right...David Egan. 

EXT. - Hospital --- Julie, Ray and Helen are walking through the hall ready to 
leave and they are discussing what they should do. 

Ray - 
Look I don't think we should give up on Max, it could still be him. 

Julie - 
Then find him Ray, prove Barry wrong, that's what you want isn't it? 

Ray - 
No, no, what I want is for you and me to just... 

Julie - 
Listen to me Ray okay, I want you to get something, there is no you and me. 

Julie takes off down the stairs instead of waiting for the elevator. Ray and 
Helen look at each other and Helen follows Julie. 

INT. - Julies house - Julie and Helen are looking up articles about David Egan 
on the internet. 

Julie - 
Okay I can access the local library online, I think we can cross-refrence and 
pull up all we need to know. 

She finds what she is looking for and types in her querey. 

Julie - 
Egan, David. 

A bunch of articles pop up on the screen. 

Helen - 
All these articles are about David Egan? 

Julie - 
Yeah or at least mention him, it should pull up anything with his name. 

Julie- 
Wait, July 5th two years ago, what's this? 

Julie start reading one outloud. 

Julie - 
Susie Willis died of drowning, she was trapped in a car after it skided out of 
control on the reefs near Dawsons beach, the driver David Egan was unharmed. 

Helen - 
I remember that wreck two summers ago. 

Julie (still reading) - 
Susie was engaged to David, they were gonna be married. Wait a second I remember 
he had her name tattooed on his arm, I saw it. 

Julie pops up another article. 

Julie - 
Survived by his mother Claire and sister Melissa Egan of Marible County. 

Helen - 
They live in the sticks, what do you think? 

Julie - 
Whadda we got to lose?? 

EXT. - Marible County Road --- Julie and Helen are driving to the Egan house. 
Helen is reading a map. 

Helen - 
Turn right. 

Julie - 
Where?? 

Helen - 
Back there. 

They back the car up to get to the road they are looking for and turn down it. 

Helen - 
What exactly is the plan? I mean are we just gonna ring the doorbell and say we 
killed your son and we were in the neighborhood so... 

Julie - 
Look I thought we would scope it out then play it by ear. 

Helen - 
Don't you think we should have some sort of a plan? Angela Landsbury always had 
a plan. 

The car stops at a mailbox that has "Egan" written is bold letters. 

EXT. - The Egans driveway --- Julie and Helen are walking towards the house. 

Helen - 
What if they're waiting for us? What if they recognize us? They could have a gun 
and shoot us dead. 

Julie - 
It's been a year Helen, they could have done that already. 

Helen - 
Yeah, Jodi Foster tried this and a skinner of a serial killer answered the door. 

They get to the house and knock on the door twice and no one answers. 

Helen - 
Well it was a good try. 

Julie is not satisfied, she walks around the side of the house and looks in a 
window. 

Helen - 
Adding breaking and entering to our crime spree? 

A womans image appears in a old mirror that is sitting next to the house. The 
woman is Missy Egan. 

Missy - 
Can I help you? 

Julie - 
Oh, hi, our car stalled down the road and we were just wondering if maybe we 
could use your phone? 

INT. - The Egan house --- 

Missy - 
Phone's over there. 

Julie - 
Oh thanks. Jody, will you call triple A? 

Helen - 
You got it, Angela. 

Helen turns to go to the telephone and her face walks into a black fishing 
slicker and she screams. Julie just laughs to not look suspicious. Helen 
composses herself and goes to the phone. 

Missy - 
My name's Missy Egan. Are you girls from Mirable? 

Julie - 
No, Southport. 

Missy - 
Oh I went to Southport High. 

Julie - 
Yeah I knew you looked fimiliar, what year? 

Missy - 
Ah class of '88. 

Julie - 
Your name, Egan, it sounds very fimiliar, do you have a brother or something? 

Missy - 
I did but he was younger than me, David, younger. 

Julie - 
What class was he? 

Missy - 
Ah '92 but he's dead, he died last july. 

Julie - 
I'm so sorry. 

Missy - 
Thanks. 

Julie - 
Do you ah, do you live alone? 

Missy - 
Yeah, ah well my daddy died a long time ago and my mama she's in a home you know 
in Aurora because she didn't take, take too well to what happened with David. 
Things just haven't been the same since he died. 

A long pause and then Helen walks over after her phone call. 

Helen - 
They're on their way. 

Missy - 
I could make you guys a cup of tea while you're waiting. 

Helen - 
Thanks. 

Julie - 
Yeah thanks, that's nice of you. 

Missy smiles and walks into the kitchen. Helen and Julie are looking at pictures 
of David and Missy in happier times. 

Helen - 
You know I think I remember David, he had a friend right? what was his name? 

Missy (from the kitchen) - 
Who? 

Helen - 
Didn't he hang out with this guy, I mean they were really close, god what was 
his name. 

Missy - 
Oh, I don't know, I didn't know too many of Davids friends 

Helen - 
Oh 

Missy - 
But there, there was one guy, one guy, he stopped by not too long after Davids 
death and and he came to pay his respects. 

Julie - 
Really?? 

Missy - 
Oh, yeah he was a really nice guy, he was cute and smart. And well we were sweet 
on each other for about two minutes, but it didn't work out you know. He never 
really said it but I think it hurt him to be around me. 

Helen - 
Where is this old friend now? 

Missy - 
Oh I don't know. 

Helen - 
Do you remember his name? 

Missy - 
Billy. 

Helen - 
Did he have a last name? 

Missy is looking up remembering her time with Billy Blue. 

Missy - 
Blue...Billy Blue 

Julie - 
Well you know what? We should probably wait back at the car. 

Missy - 
No don't be ridiculous, why don't... ah stay. 

Julie - 
No, I don't want to miss triple A. 

Helen - 
We apreciate the phone. 

The begin to leave, Missy yells as they are leaving... 

Missy - 
Anytime you know, I don't get too many knocks on my door nowadays. 

EXT.- Julies Car --- They have just left Missys house and Julie is upset. 

Helen - 
You okay? 

Julie - 
I wigged out I'm sorry. But being in his house and seeing his sister. God do you 
see what we've done? 

Helen - 
It was an accident. 

Julie - 
Helen we killed a man and then ruined the lives of everyone he knew. 

Helen - 
I don't think we're that powerful Julie, You're giving us way too much credit. 

Missy runs up along side of the car and pounds on the window making Julie and 
Helen jump. 

Missy - 
Hey! You forgot your cigarettes. 

Julie - 
Thank you. 

Missy - 
Well I see you got this car started didn't ya? 

Julie - 
Yeah damndest thing, it started right up. 

Missy - 
Funny how that happens. 

Julie drives away as Missy is still talking leaving Missy with a sinister look 
on her face. 

EXT. - Helens house --- Julie and Helen are in the car still, Julie is dropping 
Helen off. 

Helen - 
So what now? 

Julie - 
Now we try and locate this Billy Blue. 

Helen - 
Maybe he wanted to die. 

Julie - 
What? 

Helen - 
David Egan. His girlfriend was killed on that same road july 4th one year 
earlier,. Maybe he blammed himself, maybe he was sitting in the road waiting for 
us to hit him. 

Julie - 
Yeah if that'll help you sleep at night. 

Helen - 
What happened between us? We used to be best friends. 

Julie - 
We used to be a lot of things. 

Helen - 
I miss you. 

No response from Julie. Helen sees that the feeling isn't mutual. 

Helen - 
Yeah. Well. 

She gets out of the car and Julie drives away without saying a word. 

INT. - Helens house - Helen walks into the living room and sees her father 
sitting watching TV. 

Helen - 
Hey Dad. 

Her father is too wrapped up in the ball game to notice his daughter. She walks 
into the kitchen and pours a glass of diet coke while the killer is sneaking in 
the front door and working his way up the stairs. Helen finishes her drink and 
goes up to her bedrooom just in time to miss seeing who just went up before her. 
She gets to her room but no one is there. She changes into her night clothes and 
looks at the crown that she will have to give back the next day. Suddenly a hand 
is moving towards her and touches her on the arm, she jumps and turns around, 
it's Elsa. 

Elsa - 
Hey is the washed up, dried out, has-been having a moment? 

Helen - 
What do you want? 

Elsa - 
We're doing inventory at the store tomorrow and I need you there by ten. 

Helen sits on her bed brushing her hair. 

Helen - 
I can't, I'm in the parade tomorrow. 

Elsa - 
Well dad put me in charge of the store and I want you there by ten. 

Helen - 
The outgoing queen has to ride in the parade prior to the padgent, it's 
tradition, there's nothing I can do about it. 

Elsa - 
You and your hair, it's so pathetic. 

Helen - 
You can leave now. 

Elsa - 
So very pathetic... 

she says while shutting the door. Helen gets in bed and shuts the lights out. 

INT. - Helens bedroom --- Helen is just waking up. She feels her crown on her 
head and begins to take it off, bunches of her hair come off with it. She starts 
to freak out and runs to the mirror and sees the word "SOON" written in bold 
letters on it and she screams loudly and smashes the mirror. 

INT. - Julies house --- Julie picks up a ringing telephone. 

Julie - 
Hello? 

short pause. 

Julie - 
Oh my god. 

She runs out of the house and jumops in her car and takes off. In the car she 
hears a noise coming from the back seat, there is nothing there, she stops the 
car and opens the trunk and sees the rotting corpse of Max being eaten by crabs, 
he is wearing Barrys jacket. She screams and slams the trunk thinking what to do 
and then takes off running. 

INT. - Helens bedroom --- Barry is comforting Helen after her hellish ordeal. 
Julie runs in the room. 

EXT. - Julies car --- Barry, Helen and Julie are walking towards the car. 

Barry - 
Are you sure he was dead? 

Julie - 
Don't ask me that again, he was dead okay? I saw him with these... with these 
crabs. 

Julie passes the keys to Barry. 

Julie - 
You do it. 

Barry opens the trunk and sees that it is empty and very clean looking. Julie is 
upset. 

Julie - 
No don't, don't even, he was there god dammit and he was wearing your jacket 
Barry. 

Barry - 
Where'd he go? Did the crabs carry him away? 

Julie - 
I swear to god. 

Helen - 
I believe you Julie. 

Julie - 
He took the body, he came and he took the body. 

Barry - 
Why would he do that? 

Julie - 
I don't know Barry okay? Why would he try to run you over? Why'd he make 
coleslaw in Helens head? He's fucking with us. 

Barry - 
Come on Julie let's go back to the house? 

Julie - 
Where's your jacket Barry? Don't you see? He's got us now, okay this is exactly 
what he wants, we can't go to the police, not now, he's made sure of that. He's 
just out there and he's watching us and waiting. 

She turns and looks around and starts screaming... 

Julie - 
What are you waiting for huh? What are you waiting for???? 

EXT. - Helens house --- The three are walking towards the house and Ray is 
walking towards them. 

Julie - 
What are you doing here? 

Ray - 
I've been looking everywhere for you guys. 

Barry - 
You're gonna die. 

Barry walks up and punches Ray in the face with his fist which is still in a 
cast. 

Julie - 
Hey, hey stop it. 

Ray - 
What are you going? 

Julie - 
Stop it. 

Ray - 
I didn't do anything. 

Barry - 
You're fucking lying. He's lying. 

Julie - 
Leave him alone Barry, get a grip. 

Barry - 
No wake up Julie, he's behind this. How many fucked up fishermen are out there? 

Ray - 
Look, he's after me too. I got a letter. 

Barry - 
Oh you got a letter? I got run over. Helen gets her hair chopped off. Julie gets 
a body in a trunk and you get a letter?? That's balanced? 

Ray - 
What body? What are you talking about? 

Barry - 
Drop the act. You killed Max, you took my jacket. 

Ray - 
Max is dead? 

Barry - 
What is it with you Ray? You were dogging us from the start weren't you? Always 
wanting to be our friend, always wanting to be one of us but you were too 
fucking jealous to handle it 

Ray - 
Fuck you! 

Julie - 
Stop it! Look, we have to stick togeather alright? We have to help each other. 

Barry - 
Okay so if it's not fisherboy here then who is it and how do we find him? 

Julie - 
We think his name is Billy Blue. 

Ray - 
How do you know that? 

Helen - 
Missy, said there was a friend named Billy Blue. 

Julie - 
Who probably went to school with David Egan so according to sis that would make 
him class of '92. 

Helen - 
Elsa was class of '92. Maybe there's something in her yearbook. 

INT. - Helens bedroom --- They are all looking through the yearbook at David 
Egans picture. 

Ray - 
So that's him huh? Hard to believe that's the guy. 

Barry - 
Yeah his face isn't splattered all over the road dumbass. Maybe Blue's not his 
real name. 

Julie - 
That's right, he could have easily lied to Missy, we did. 

Helen - 
Maybe we should bring the yearbook to Missy, if she had it in front of her... 

Julie - 
...She could point him out. 

Ray - 
I'm not going anywhere. High school mugshots, what??? 

Julie - 
I'll go, you've got that parade today. 

Helen - 
Forget it. 

Julie - 
No you need to be there in case he shows up. 

Helen - 
I don't want him to show up. 

Julie - 
Helen this could be our chance, we could catch him. I'll go to Missys, Barry you 
go to the parade with Helen and don't let her out of your sight, if he shows 
up... 

Barry - 
I'll pound his ass. 

Ray - 
Listen to yourselves, you sound like a bunch of vigulanties. 

Julie - 
It's july 4th Ray. Okay? This is his day. Whatever he's planned in going to 
happend today unless we stop him. 

Ray - 
Come on Julie, don't you see? It's that moment where we have to make a decision, 
let's make the right one this time. 

Julie - 
I'm not interested in what's right anymore Ray I wanna do what's smart. 

Ray - Then let's get the hell out of here, we can leave town, disapear. 

Julie - 
I've already disapeared, okay? Now I want my life back. Look we have to face 
this, what's it gonna be Ray? 

EXT. - The parade --- Helen is riding the float and Barry is sitting on the 
side. Both of them are looking all over the place for the man in the slicker. 
Helen sees a man in a black slicker and yells to Barry. 

Helen - 
Barry. Barry! Over there.! 

Barry looks over and sees the man in the slicker walking away. Barry chases him 
screaming at people to move and get out of the way untill he finally tackles the 
man to the ground and removes the hat. It's an old man who looks like Barry has 
given him a heartattack. 

Barry - 
Shit! Where the hell is he? 

EXT. - Missys house - Julie is just pulling into the driveway. she gets out and 
knocks on the door. 

Julie - 
Missy???? Hello???? 

She starts to walk around the house to look for Missy when she sees Missy coming 
at her with a knife. 

Julie - 
Please! Missy? Missy do you remember me from the other day? You know the car 
trouble? 

Missy - 
What are you doing here? 

EXT. - The parade --- Helen is on her float looking around trying to find Barry, 
she looks up and sees a man standing on a building looking at her, he is wearing 
a slicker and he pulls his big hook, it's the killer. Helen is scared. 

EXT. - Missys house --- Missy and Julie are talking out by an old shed. Missy is 
cutting up some rotten looking fish. 

Julie - Please we need to talk. I need to find your brothers friend Billy Blue, 
I need to talk to him and I was thinking that maybe you could look through this 
yearbook? 

Missy - 
Now what's this all about? 

Julie - 
Well it's too crazy to explain but it has to do with your brother and last july 
4th. 

Missy - 
What about it? 

Julie - 
What happened to your brother wasn't an acident, there's more to it than that. 

Missy - 
I know. 

Julie - 
You know what? 

Missy - 
Well he killed himself. 

Julie - 
He what? 

Missy - 
Yeah he went up there to die that night that's where Susie died. See the whole 
town blammed him for her death so he blammed himself. 

Julie - 
But how do you know it was a suicide? 

Missy - 
He left a note. 

Missy walks over to the decaying tool shed and gets out the note. 

Missy - 
I had to keep this hidden from the insurance company cause they wouldn't pay me 
the money if it was suicide. That don't much matter anymore cause the money's 
been spent. That's it. 

She passes the note to Julie which says "I WILL NEVER FORGET LAST SUMMER". 

Julie - 
This isn't a suicide note. This is a death threat. 

Missy - 
What are you... What are you talking about? 

Julie - 
Your brother didn't kill himself Missy, I saw him, I was there and whoever sent 
this was there too. 

Missy - 
What do you mean you saw him? Where? Where did you see him? 

Julie - 
He was crossing the road, we hit him, it was an accident. 

Missy - 
No! My brother drowned. 

Julie - 
I saw him, he has Susie tattooed on his arm. 

Missy - 
Tattoo? He doesn't have a tattoo on his arm. 

Julie - 
I saw it on his right forearm. 

Missy is getting upset at what Julie is saying. 

Missy - 
You didn't seeanything, get out of here. Get out of my house. 

Missy puts the letter away and disapears. 

Julie - 
Oh my god, it wasn't your brother. 

INT. - Croaker Queen stage --- The crew is setting the stage up getting ready 
for the event. Barry and Helen are backstage, she is upset at having just seen 
the killer. Barry is trying to comfort her. 

Barry - 
Stay calm. I'll be up in the balcony. 

Helen - 
He had a hook Barry. I saw it, it was a big huge hook. 

Barry - 
Everything's gonna be alright. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. 

Cut to --- A little while later --- The contest has started. Everyone is on 
stage. 

MC - 
Very nicley done ladies. And now let's meet last years winner, Miss Helen 
Shivers. 

Helen walks out to a cheering crowd, she looks up in the balcony focusing on 
Barry. A girl is very horribly singing a very horrible song. Helen laughs and 
looks up at Barry who is also laughing. She looks back at the girl then back up 
at Barry to see the killer coming up behind him and pulls him back. Helen goes 
crazy, she starts screaming and running towards the balcony but the crowd is in 
an uproar and she can't get through. A cop stops her. And the killer is slashing 
Barry to death with his hook. 

Helen - 
HELP HIM. PLEASE. BARRY!!! 

Cop - 
Excuse me. What's the problem?? 

Helen - 
Help him he's gonna kill him. 

Cop - 
Who's killing who? 

Helen - 
Up in the balcony. 

Cop - 
Okay everybody stay calm. 

Helen - 
Get off of me! 

There is a lot of commotion going on and everyone is talking over each other. 
Helen follows the cop up into the balcony. 

Cop - 
Mame stay behind me okay? 

They look around but find no one or no trace that anyone had ever been there. 

Cop - 
There's nobody up here. I gotta tell ya, this is really not my idea of a funny 
joke. 

Helen - 
He was here. 

Cop - 
Who? Who was here? 

Helen - 
The fisherman, he killed Barry. 

Cop - 
Barry who? Who are we talking about? There's nobody up here, come on let's go 
back downstairs, come one, come on, there's nobody up here. 

As they are walking dowstairs they don't see the blood dripping from the edge of 
the balcony. 

After the Croaker queen contest Helen is still sitting there looking at the 
floor. Almost everyone has left, the cop comes up to her. 

Cop - 
Mame, I'm gonna take you home, your parents are really worried about you. 

Helen - 
You have to believe me. 

Cop - 
Why don't you let me take you home okay? 

She gets up to leave with him and the MC grabs at her crown. 

MC - 
Excuse me, we'll be needing this. 

INT. - Julies house --- Julie is on her computer looking for articles on Susie 
Willis. 

EXT. - Police car --- Cop is driving Helen home. 

Cop - 
So then he killed him with a fish hook? 

Helen - 
Yes. 

Cop - 
Did this fisherman guy use the same hook to cut all your hair off? 

Helen - 
No, he used scissors asshole. Look, okay I know I sound delusional but it's 
true. 

Cop - 
Yeah I've heard this story before except the way I heard it it wasn't a 
fisherman, it was an escaped mental patient and he had a hook for a hand. We're 
gonna have to take the alley. 

Helen - 
Look, you little shitstick mayberry ass regect, there's been a murder and you're 
gonna fry in hell if you ignore it. 

Cop - 
Alright, I'll tell you what I'll do, okay I'll contact Barry's parents and put 
out a search for him alright? He was probably just playing a prank on you. 

The cop sees a man standing under the hood of his car. 

Cop - 
Oh jesus, listen I'm just gonna be a minute alright, I'm gonna see if this guy 
needs help. 

He gets out of the car and walks over to the man. Helen can tell who it is. 

Helen - 
That's him. 

Cop - 
What's the trouble? 

Helen starts yelling to the cop. 

Helen - 
That's him, behind you, BEHIND YOU! 

The cops turns back to the man who then sticks his hook in the cops stomach, 
bloods runs from the cops mouth. Helen screams, she tries to get out but she is 
in the back which is locked from the outside, the killer starts coming towards 
the car, she kicks the glass out of the window and crawls out and starts 
running, he is following her. 

INT. - Julies House --- Julie is still looking at articles about Susie Willis on 
the internet. She is reading outloud. 

Julie - 
Susie Willis killed, trapped in car, driver unharmed, survived by her father, 
Benjamin, a local fisherman. 

With that, Julie runs out the door. 

EXT. - On the streets --- the killer is still chasing Helen, she see the store 
that her family owns, Elsa is inside closing up for the night. Helen runs 
towards the store screaming for Elsa. 

Helen - 
ELSA, ELSA, OPEN THE DOOR, ELSA, OPEN THE DOOR, PLEASE, JESUS CHRIST HURRY. 

Elsa is slow in getting to the door, she finishes putting plastic over some 
items and then goes to get the keys. 

Helen - 
ELSA WHAT ARE YOU GOING? ELSA, PLEASE, OPEN THE DOOR, JESUS CHRIST NOW! 

Elsa - 
I'm coming 

Helen - 
ELSA, ELSA, PLEASE. 

Elsa finally opens the door, Helen runs in and slams the door behind her. 

Elsa - 
You could have walked around the Arch Tree entrance it's open. 

Helen - 
I'm being attacked. 

Elsa - 
You're what? 

They look outside and see no one. 

Helen - 
Lock the other door, I'll call the police. 

Elsa - 
What is going on? 

Helen - 
Just do what I say god dammit. 

Helen runs upstairs to use the phone, Elsa goes to the back entrance to lock the 
door. The door is swinging shut just before she walks in, she begins to lock it 
when she sees a reflection in the door, she turns around to see the man in a 
slicker standing looking at her with his face covered, she can't move or speak. 
His reflection passes through her glasses and she screams as the large hook 
slashes her throat. Helen hears the scream and hangs up the phone slowly moving 
down the stairs. 

Helen - 
Elsa? Elsa? Elsa where are you? 

No response, she gets paranoid and tunrs around looking closley at a mannequin 
that is covered in plastic, it is very silent then all of the sudden he jumps 
out from under the plastic and tackles her to the ground, she escapes and runs 
up the stairs, she passes by the bathroom and sees Elsa dead laying on the 
floor, she screams and keeps running and hops onto an old hand operated 
elevator, the killer is following her, she gets on the elevator and starts 
pulling the rope, he can't get on it but he swings his hook at her legs, she 
finally gets up to the attic and the killer has used the stairs and is also up 
there, she runs over to the edge of a window, he comes for her, she jumps out 
landing in a dumpster full of wood and other garbage. In a daze she looks up to 
the window and sees the killer is gone. She takes off running down the street, 
through alleys to try and find someone who can help her, fireworks go off and 
she sees that the parade is still going on, she runs towards them and hears a 
noise, she turns around and there is nothing, she turns back towards the parade, 
the killer is standing behind her, he grabs her and throws her into a stack of 
tires and he slashes her to death. 

EXT. - On the streets --- Julie is looking for her friends and sees the boat Ray 
works on, she runs towards the boat. 

Julie - 
Ray? Ray ? Ray? 

Rays head pops up from below the boat. 

Ray- 
Julie, what are you doing here? 

Julie - 
We didn't kill David Egan, it was someone else on the road that night. 

Ray - 
What are you talking about? 

Julie - 
I think it was Susies father, Ben Willis, he's a fisherman. 

Ray - 
But they found Davids body in the water. 

Julie - 
Yeah I know but I think Ben Willis killed David Egan. 

Ray - 
Wait a second. You think this Willis guy killed David then we killed him? 

Julie - 
Yeah but what if he didn't die Ray? What if he's still alive? 

Ray - 
This is crazy. Come aboard. Come inside. 

Julie - 
No we've gotta find Helen and Barry. 

Ray - 
We will, we will. 

He holds out his hand and she reaches for it and sees the name of his boat is 
"Billy Blue". She pulls her hand back. 

Julie - 
You. Oh my god it's you. 

Ray - 
What are you talking about? 

Julie - 
Billy Blue. You went to Missys, your, your the friend, your the fisherman. 

She runs faster than she has ever ran in her life, Ray yells behind her. 

Ray - 
I can explain...Julie wait, Julie. 

He is running in back of her, she runs into a locked door. 

Julie - 
Shit. 

Ray - 
Wait. 

Julie - 
Stop it. 

He keeps chasing her when all of the sudden an man sticks his arm out sending 
Ray to the ground. Julie screams. 

Julie - 
Oh, oh please help me please. 

Man - 
East child. 

Julie - 
Please I need to call the police. 

Ray starts to get up. 

Man - 
On the boat, inside, hurry. 

She runs onto the boat, the man leaves Ray on the ground and walks onto the boat 
too, he removes the anchor. Julie looks around and sees pictures of herslef and 
her three friends all over the place. The man walks in. 

Man - 
You in some kind of trouble child? 

Julie - 
Yes, yeah I'm in a lot of trouble. 

The man flips a silver medallion that says "I Love You". 

Man - 
That's a shame, being it's forth of july and all. Kids like you should be out 
having fun, drinking, partying, running people over, getting away with murder, 
things like that. 

A shocked look comes over Julies face, what is going on? 

Julie - 
You? Ben Willis? 

Man - 
Good, I see you've been doing your homework too. 

She runs out the door looking for somewhere to go. He follows her back and forth 
playing cat and mouse. Ray has gotten up, he is looking at the boat that has 
started drifting from shore. Julie finds a gun used to signal for help in case 
of emergancy, he is steering the boat now and jives it sending the signal gun 
over the edge. They have a state-down then he comes after her. She crawls down a 
cubbyhole below deck that is covered by a mesh grate, she pulls down on it from 
below as he is trying to pull it open with his hook. Ray is now climbing over 
the side of the boat and comes face to face with Ben. 

Ben - 
Welcome aboard Ray. 

He moves his hook through the air tauntint Ray with it then starts swinging it 
at him. Julie is below deck still looking for a way to get out, she clibs up a 
ladder and sees Ben and Ray fighting, she screams to Ray, he turns his head and 
Ben hits him with his hook which sends him flying off the voat into the water, 
he is dragging along underwater holding onto a net. Julie runs down below again, 
Ben is following her, she shuts the door and blocks it with a oil drum. 

Ben - 
Open the door Julie. You got no place to hide 

She is looking for somewhere to go, she opens up a shut door, it is hard to open 
so she uses her shirt, she gets it open and ice spills out, she crawls in and 
starts pushing more ice down so Ben can't get in. She breaks apart a crate 
filled with ice, the body of Helen comes falling down with the ice, Julie 
screams and moves over and feels something, she moves her hand and Barrys frozen 
face and underneath of it, she screams again. Ray has made his way back onto the 
boat. Ben opens a trap door and he is looking down at Julie who screams in 
terror. Ray is watching what Ben does, waiting for the right moment to pounce. 
Ray then swings down a big hook attached to a rope which hits Ben in the face 
throwing him to the ground. Ray runs over and looks down at Julie. Julie screams 
expecting it to be Ben. 

Ray - 
Come on Julie. 

Julie - 
Ray. 

He sticks his hand out and pulls her out of the ice pit. Ben jumps up, Julie 
screams, Ben knocks Ray to the ground. 

Ben - 
Happy fourth of july Julie. 

Julie - 
Please, it was an accident. 

Ben - 
I know all about accidents and let me give you some advice, when you leave a man 
for dead, make sure he's really dead. 

He then sticks his hand up in the air which is holding the hook, he is ready to 
slash Julie with it when all of the sudden his hand gets caught in a rope, Ray 
sees this and hits something which pulls Ben up into the air and hand gets 
chopped off in the pully, he falls halfway down again and the rope catches which 
then sends him flying off into the cold ocean. 

EXT. - Wharf --- Julie and Ray and a bunch of police and doctors are around. Ray 
and Julie are hugging. The ordeal is over. 

Julie - 
We never killed anyone, this whole year was fake. 

Ray - 
I know. The guilt was killing me, I had to know who he was, that's why I went to 
see Missy. I'm sorry I didn't tell you but I wanted you back, I couldn't lose 
you again. I love you Julie. No one gets me the way you do. 

Julie - 
I understand your pain. 

The sheriff walks over. 

Shreiff - 
Do you have any idea why this man would want you dead? 

Julie and Ray - 
None. 

They have dragged the ocean and are pulling up what they have found. 

Operator - 
Here it comes. 

All that is in the net is Bens hand with the hook still in it. 

Sheriff - 
Ah don't worry, the body will turn up, they usually do. 

ONE YEAR LATER

EXT. - Julies College --- People are walking around outside. 

INT. - Womens locker room --- Julie is on the phone with Ray. 

Julie - 
Yeah well I made the deans list. Thank you very much. I know I miss you too but 
I'm going to see you in a couple weeks, god I can not wait, I love New York. No 
of course I love you more....Yes I do, I love you and you know that but you know 
what? I've got to take a shower or I'm gonna be late. 

Julies roommate Deb is outside the showers. 

Deb - 
Hey Julie you got some mail. 

Julie - 
Oh thanks Deb. 

Back to the phone 

Julie - 
...A towel. Ray don't you start with me, you mister can ravage me in two weeks. 
Yes I love you too. Okay bye. 

She hangs up the phone and goes out to get her mail, a look of terror crosses 
her face, a plain envelope with her name written on it in bold letters. She 
looks around then opens the letter that says "KBR POOL PARTY" She smiles and 
goes back to the showers, walking through the steam she sees written on the 
shower door "I STILL KNOW". She looks around and sees nothing, she turns back to 
the shower door and something black jumps out at her. 

THE END
