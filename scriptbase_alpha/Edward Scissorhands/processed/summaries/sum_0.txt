In a castle high on top of a hill lives an inventor's greatest creation - Edward, a near-complete person.
The creator died before he could finish Edward's hands; instead, he is left with metal scissors for hands.
Since then, he has lived alone, until a kind lady called Peg discovers him and welcomes him into her home.
At first, everyone welcomes him into the community, but soon things begin to take a change for the worse.
