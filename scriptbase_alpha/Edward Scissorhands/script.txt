          Snuggle in, sweetie. It's cold out there.
          
                    GRANDDAUGHTER
          Why is it snowing, grandma? Where does it come 
          from?
          
                    OLD KIM
          Oh, that's a long story, sweetheart.
          
                    GRANDDAUGHTER
          I want to hear.
          
                    OLD KIM
          Oh, not tonight. Go to sleep.
          
                    GRANDDAUGHTER
          I'm not sleepy. Tell me, please.
          
                    OLD KIM
          Well, all right. Let's see. I guess it would 
          have to start with scissors.
          
                    GRANDDAUGHTER
          Scissors?
          
                    OLD KIM
          Well, there are all kinds of scissors. And once 
          there was even a man who had scissors for 
          hands.
          
                    GRANDDAUGHTER
          A man?
          
                    OLD KIM
          Yes.
          
                    GRANDDAUGHTER
          Hands, scissors?
          
                    OLD KIM
          No, scissorhands. You know the mansion on top 
          of the mountain?
          
                    GRANDDAUGHTER
          It's haunted.
          
                    OLD KIM
          Well, a long time ago, an inventor lived in 
          that mansion. He made many things, I suppose. 
          He also created a man. He gave him inside, a 
          heart, a brain, everything. Well, almost 
          everything. You see, the inventor was very old. 
          He died before he got to finish the man he 
          invented. So the man was left by himself, 
          incomplete and all alone.
          
                    GRANDDAUGHTER
          He didn't have a name?
          
                    OLD KIM
          Of course, he had a name. His name was Edward.

          My changing looks? That's good.
               (Helen chuckles)
          
                    PEG
          Well, it goes that saying and I also have a 
          complete selection of your old favorites, those

                    HELEN
          Come on, Peg. I never buy anything from you. 
          You know that?
          
                    PEG
          I know. Bye, Helen.
          
                    REPAIRMAN
          You know, you didn't have to call me, ma'am. 
          You could have taken care of this by yourself.
          
                    JOYCE
          I could? I don't think so.
          
                    REPAIRMAN
          Yeah, you see, it's easy. The food trap's 
          clogged. That's all. You see this bolt here? 
          You just unscrew this. OK? And out she pops.
          
                    JOYCE
          You know, on TV they say you repairmen are 
          lonely bunch of people. Housewives get lonely 
          too. Although you may not realize it since they 
          haven't made a commercial on the subject.
          
                    REPAIRMAN
          And then you just take this and put it back in 
          here nice and easy. Be careful not to force it, 
          because it fits in there by itself. And then 
          you just screw this back on.
               (The bell rings.)
          
                    JOYCE
          On no! Who could that be? Will you excuse me 
          for a moment? Now. Don't go anywhere. I'll be 
          right back. This is fascinating. I wouldn't 
          want to miss a moment of it.
          
                    PEG
          Good morning, Joyce. Avon calling.
          
                    JOYCE
          Why! Peg. Have you gone blind? Can't you see 
          there's a vehicle in my driveway?
          
                    PEG
          Oh, yes.
          
                    JOYCE
          Well, I'm surprised you don't realize that 
          means I'm busy. 
               (Joyce shuts the door with a 
               bang.)
          
                    PEG
          Okay. Now, we should decide on lipsticks. Okay, 
          dear, what one did you like best? There was the 
          Winsome Wahini which looked charming on you. Or 
          the Bahenie Bliss.
          
                    A GIRL
          I like them both.

          Well, great.

          you?

               through her rearview mirror and 
               drives to the place. She is 
               attracted by the beautiful garden 
               there and enters the mansion.)

          stupid of me! I'll just be going now.

          Are you alone? Do you live up here all by 
          yourself? What happened to your face? Hum, you 
          know, I won't hurt you. But at the very least 
          let me give you a good astringent and this will 
          help to prevent infection. What's your name?

          guest?
          
                    HELEN
          She didn't say anything. She rang my doorbell

          Peg. I didn't get a very good look at him. He 
          looked kind of pale. Okay, I'll be right there.

          Here we are. So, oh, this is the living room 
          and back here, the bedrooms. You want to see 
          the pictures? All right. Well, this is my 
          husband, Bill. He's a bowling champion. Do you 
          know what bowling is? Bowling? Well, here they 
          are down at the lake, fishing. I think Kevin 
          looks a little glum Because they didn't catch 
          anything that day. And here's my daughter, Kim. 
          All dressed up the junior prom. She's a senior 
          now. I can't believe it. She's camping in the 
          mountains with some friends, but she'll be back 
          in a few days and you can meet her then. Isn't 
          she beautiful? That's my family. Now, go on, 
          dear. I'll show you the rest of the house. Then 
          you can just freshen up and make yourself at 
          home. Okay? That's the kitchen over there. You 
          help yourself to anything you want to eat or 
          drink. Those are grapes. Back here are the 
          bedrooms. Let me get you some towels, then I 
          will see what we can find to wear. You know 
          what? I think I have some of Bill's old clothes 
          in here. This is perfect. Here. These should 
          just fit you. 
               (The phone rings.)
          Oh, no, no. Don't be alarmed. That's just a 
          phone. Now you can go in Kim's room and put 
          these on. I'll be right with you.

          No, no, scissors. That's right. Well, he was 
          born up there or something. Have you seen him 
          before? No, I don't think he's been off the 
          grounds before today. You're kidding. How did 
          you get together with him? I have to go. I'll 
          talk to you later Margie, Bye-bye.

          You think you can sleep? Things feel strange 
          now, but soon you'll feel right at home. Good 
          night.

               scars.)
          
                    PEG
          The light concealing cream goes on first, then 
          you blend and blend and blend. Blending is the 
          secret. More concealing for you? But you 
          complexion is so fair. Now this has a touch of 
          lavender in it. Give it a try here. Close 
          enough. OK. This should do the trick here. I 
          have another idea. We'll cover up the scars and 
          start with a completely smooth surface. Don't

          should the napkin be entirely unfolded." Oh 
          should the center crease. Be allowed to remain? 
          It is so easy to commit embarrassing 
          blunders. "But etiquette humiliation and
          discomfort. Mmm yes, boring. Let us switch to, 
          Um... To some poetry, Hmm?" "There was an old 
          man from the cape." "Who made himself there, 
          but they keep such a beautiful shape." That's 
          right. Go ahead, smile. It's funny. That's

          Oh, Edward, it does seem that that's what you 
          should do, bit it's not.
          
                    KEVIN
          You dope, everybody knows he's supposed to give 
          it to the police.

          Good thinking, Kevin.

          Well, think about it, you guys, I mean, that's 
          the nicer thing to do. That's what I would do.

          have any more bells, honey?

          So do I, honey. You know, when I brought Edward 
          down here to live with us, I really didn't 
          think things through. And I didn't think about 
          what could happen to him, or to us, or to the 
          neighborhood. You know, I think that maybe it 
          might be best if he goes back up there. Because 
          at least there he's safe, and we'd just go back 
          to normal.

          Jim. Stop! Stop it, or I'll kill you myself.
          
                    JIM
          Hey! I said stay away from her!

                    EDWARD
          Goodbye!
          
                    KIM
          I love you.
          
                    A MAN
          Is he in there?
          
                    KIM
          He's dead. The roof caved in on him. They 
          killed each other. You can see for yourselves. 
               (She raises a pair of scissors.)
          
                    OLD KIM
          She never saw him again. Not after that night.
          
                    GRANDDAUGHTER
          How do you know?
          
                    OLD KIM
          Because I was there.
          
                    GRANDDAUGHTER
          You could have gone up there. You still could 
          go.
          
                    OLD KIM
          No, sweetheart. I'm an old woman now. I would 
          rather want him remember me the way as I was.
          
                    GRANDDAUGHTER
          How do you know he's still alive.
          
                    OLD KIM
          I don't know. Not for sure. But I believe he 
          is. You see, before he came down here, it never 
          snowed. And afterwards it did. If he weren't up 
          there now, I don't think it would be snowing. 
          Sometimes you can still catch me dancing in it.
