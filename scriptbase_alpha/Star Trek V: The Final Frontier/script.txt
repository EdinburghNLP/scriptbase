               Shimmering waves of heat. A flat, unforgiving landscape
               stretches to infinity. A storm of dust gathers on the
               horizon, small at first, increasing in size as it rolls
               toward us.

               A withered tree is revealed f.g. with a rifle leaning
               against it.

          2   EXT. DRY LAKE BED - DAY

               CAMERA PANS an arid expanse of scorched earth. J'ONN, a
               ragged and malnourished homesteader of some alien race,
               toils beneath a blazing sun, his BACK TO CAMERA. He
               sinks an auguring device into the ground, drilling in
               vain for water. There are many hundreds of holes in the
               earth around him. He suddenly straightens and squints
               into the dust storm as HOOFBEATS fill the SOUNDTRACK.

          3   ANGLE

               J'onn releases his auguring device and hurries toward 
               his rifle.

          4   J'ONN'S POV (INTERCUT - SLOW MOTION)

               Horse and RIDER, dressed in a hooded cape, thunder
               toward him.

          5   BACK TO SCENE

               The CAMERA TILTS DOWN revealing J'onn's rifle as he
               cocks the weapon.

               He uses stones as ammunition, which slip from his hand
               and fall to the parched ground as he tries to load the
               rifle. He turns and points the gun as the Rider continues
               his approach.

          6   J'onn raises his gun as the Rider reins his horse to a
               halt ten feet short of him. The beast snorts and stamps
               its hooves impatiently while the Rider studies the
               frightened homesteader and removes a breathing apparatus
               from his mouth. Finally, he speaks.

                                   RIDER
                         I thought weapons were forbidden
                         on this planet.

               The Rider swings down from the saddle. He's tall,
               powerfully built beneath his dusty robes, his face
               shadowed by a hood. He indicates their bleak surroundings.

                                   RIDER
                                   (continuing)
                         Besides, I can't believe you'd
                         kill me for a field of empty holes.

                                   J'ONN
                                   (pathetic)
                         It's all I have.

               J'onn sags under the futile weight of existence. The
               Rider approaches him without fear. It's all the homesteader
               can do to keep from sobbing.

                                   RIDER
                         Your pain runs deep.

                                   J'ONN
                                   (sobbing)
                         What do you know of my pain?

                                   RIDER
                         Let us explore it together.

               The Rider collects himself and concentrates deeply. J'onn
               is immediately transfixed. He begins to tremble. Tears
               flood his dirty cheeks.

                                   RIDER
                         (continuing; soothing tone)
                         Each man hides a secret pain. It
                         must be exposed and reckoned with.
                         It must be dragged from darkness
                         and forced into the light. Share
                         your pain. Share your pain with
                         me and gain strength from the
                         sharing.
          
          6   CONTINUED :

               J'onn whimpers and cries out in anguish. Finally, the
               catharsis ends. J'onn sobs and rests his head on the
               Rider's chest. He opens his eyes and blinks in wonder 
               and amazement at the Rider as he comforts J'onn.

                                   J'ONN
                                   (as if reborn)
                         Where did you get this power?

                                   RIDER
                         The power was within you.

                                   J'ONN
                         (trying to find the words)
                         I feel as if a weight has been
                         lifted from my heart. How can I
                         repay you for this miracle?

                                   RIDER
                         Join my quest.

                                   J'ONN
                         What is it you seek?

                                   RIDER
                         What you seek. What all men have
                         sought since time began - ultimate
                         knowledge. But to find it we'll
                         need a starship.

                                   J'ONN
                         A starship? There are no starships
                         on Nimbus III.

                                   RIDER
                         Perhaps I have a way to bring one
                         here.

                                   J'ONN
                         But how?

                                   RIDER
                         Have faith, my friend. There are
                         more of us than you know.

          7   CLOSE ON RIDER

               As he throws back his hood to reveal rugged charismatic
               features. He's bearded, his hair is shaggy. He has
               the piercing eyes of a zealot and, to our surprise,
               pointed ears. His name is SYBOK.
          
          7   CONTINUED

                                   J'ONN (O.S.)
                         You're a Vulcan.

               Sybock nods and does something we've never seen a Vulcan
               do. He smiles. As he does, the first faint bars of
               the STAR TREK THEME well up on the SOUNDTRACK.

          8   CLOSE ON SYBOCK

               As he covers his smiling mouth with his hand.

          9   ANOTHER ANGLE

               Sybok stands by his horse, laughing.

               the cosmos. Planets, stars and solar systems flash by.
               No doubt about it, we're in for a rousing Star Trek
               adventure. As the FINAL CREDITS appear, we TILT DOWN

               The hand clutches at a sheer rock, groping for purchase.
               CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK eight
               hundred feet above the surrounding forest. He climbs up
               the face of El Captain without ropes, grommets or equipment.
               Just man against mountain. Using the cracks in the
               rockface for hand and foot holes, Jim Kirk struggles up
               the treacherous incline, one painful inch at a time. We
               hold our breath, afraid he'll fall.

          12   CAMPSITE BELOW

               DR. LEONARD "BONES" McCOY watches Kirk's progress through
               futuristic binoculars with mounting unease. From this
               distance Kirk resembles a small fly on a big wall.

                                        McCOY
                         (muttering toward the mountain)
                         "You'll have a great time Bones, 
                         You'll enjoy your shore leave.
                         You'll be able to relax."
                         (lowering binoculars)
                         You call this relaxing? I'm a
                         nervous wreck.
                                   (a beat)
                         If I'm not careful, I'll end up
                         talking to myself.

          13   EL CAPITAN - KIRK

               He inserts the pads of two fingers into a narrow crack
               above his head. He exhales, focussing concentration.
               Kirk pulls himself up, balancing on a ledge barely an
               inch wide. Exhilarated, he pauses to admire the view.

          14   KIRK'S POV

               A breathtaking but vertigo-inducing HIGH ANGLE SHOT of
               Yosemite. This may be the 23rd Century but the park
               looks the same as it did three hundred years ago.

               There is a soft WHOOSHING SOUND and SPOCK suddenly rises
               INTO FRAME.

                                   SPOCK
                         Greetings, Captain.

          15   WIDE SHOT

               Spock hovers in mid- air alongside the startled Kirk, kept
               aloft by means of levitation boots. His hands are clasped
               behind his back, typically Spock-like.

                                        KIRK
                                   (he gasps)
                         Spock - What are you doing in
                         this neck of the woods?

                                   SPOCK
                         I'm flattered. Twelve hundred
                         points of interest in Yosemite and
                         you pick me.

               Spock doesn't take Kirk's hint to get lost.

                                   SPOCK
                         I regret to inform you that the
                         record for free-climbing El Captain
                         is in no danger of being broken.

                                        KIRK
                                   (as he climbs)
                         I'm not trying to break any records.
                         I'm doing this because I enjoy it.
                         Not to mention the most important
                         reason for climbing a mountain...

                                   SPOCK
                         And that is?

                                        KIRK
                                   (with a smile)
                         Because it's there.

                                   SPOCK
                         Ah, Captain?

                                        KIRK
                         MM.?

                                   SPOCK
                         I do not think you realize the
                         gravity of your situation.

               Kirk slips but manages to gain a handhold and save himself.
               Beneath his feet, a mini-avalanche of rocks is dislodged,
               tumbling to the valley below.

                                        KIRK
                              (glaring at Spock)
                         On the contrary. Gravity is foremost
                         on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make
                         an ascent here. Why don't you go
                         pester Dr McCoy for a while?

                                   SPOCK
                         I believe Dr McCoy is not in
                         the best of moods.

          16   CAMPSITE BELOW

               McCoy, still watching Kirk's progress, is getting angrier
               by the second.

                                   McCOY
                                   (grumbling)
                         Goddamn..irresponsible...
                         playing games with life...

          17   EL CAPITAN - KIRK AND SPOCK

               Kirk strains for the next handhold.

                                   SPOCK
                         Concentration is vital. You must
                         be one with the rock.

                                        KIRK
                         Spock, I appreciate your concern,
                         but if you don't stop distracting
                         me, I'm liable to be one...

               And as Kirk reaches for the next crack, the ledge comes
               loose underfoot and he finds himself falling.

          18   ANGLE - SPOCK

               He dives after Kirk, firing boosters to increase his
               speed.

          19   ANGLE - KIRK

               Twisting and turning end over end as he hurtles downward.
               He thrashes at the air, unable to defeat gravity.

          20   CAMPSITE

               McCoy turns away, unable to look.

                                   McCoy
                         Oh, my God!

          21   ANGLE - KIRK

               Dropping...dropping..the ground rushing up like a
               hungry mouth. A split second before impact...

          22   ANGLE - SPOCK

               The Vulcan swoops INTO SHOT. His powerful fingers grab
               Kirk by the ankle and jerk him upward in the nick of time

          23   CAMPSITE

               McCoy hasn't heard the expected splat. He turns to look
               and what he sees is:

          24   WIDE SHOT

               Kirk is suspended in air, bobbing upside-down at the
               end of Spock's arm.

          25   CLOSER KIRK AND SPOCK

               The top of Kirk's head is practically touching the
               ground. That's how close he came to being pizza. Kirk
               blinks in disbelief.

                                        KIRK
                         Oh, God

                         Perhaps "because it is there" is
                         not sufficient reason for climbing
                         a mountain.

                         Hello, Bones. Mind if we drop in
                         for dinner?

          27   EXT. DESERT OUTPOST - DAY

               The single outpost of civilization on this desolate world
               - a small, ramshackle village smack in the middle of
               nowhere, surrounded by high walls. A lone rider on
               horseback crosses the desert, headed for the outpost.

               SUPERIMPOSE :

                              "PARADISE CITY - NIMBUS III"

               INT. SALOON - DAY

               A 23rd Century equivalent of a frontier saloon. Futuristic
               honky-tonk MUSIC. The patrons are rugged, unpleasant types.
               Klingons, Romulans, Andorians, you name it. Much drink
               and boisterous talk. Arguments. Fistfights. Two men
               play futuristic "pool" on a table filled with water.

          29   A SEXY CATWOMAN

               Dances atop of the bar, flicking her long striped tail and
               hissing seductively at her rowdy audience.

          30   ANGLE ON SALOON DOOR

               A STRANGER coming from outside approaches familiar
               western-style doors. But instead of swinging open like
               you'd expect, they WHOOSH apart automatically. The
               stranger steps into the bar and the doors WHOOSH back
               into place.

          31   WIDE SHOT

               Talk and noise go dead as the entire saloon turns its
               attention to the newcomer. The stranger, seen only from
               the back, steps into the squalid bar. The Bartender jerks
               his thumb in the direction of the back room. The stranger
               crosses to the back room and disappears inside. Talk and
               noise resume.

               A VEIWSCREEN is revealed b.g. As the cloaked stranger
               passes through the room toward the back, we hear:

                         TELEVISION ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
                         ...your dream can become a reality...
                         the Paradise Inn...lots to choose
                         from. We at the Paradise Inn
                         attempt to create the closest thing
                         to paradise in Paradise City, that
                         is...

               INT. BACK ROOM

               The stranger lowers the breathing device from her face
               and is revealed to be a young woman. A Romulan. Her
               name is CAITHLIN DAR and she stands on the threshold of
               the room, trying to adjust her eyes to the murky
               surroundings. She's a little nervous and a long way
               from home.

               The back room is a storage area for unwanted odds and
               ends. A ceiling fan swishes overhead pushing hot air
               around. Two men are sprawled in chairs at opposite ends
               of a table. They're two busy drinking to notice
               Caithlin's entrance.

                                   CAITHLIN
                         Gentlemen, I'm Caithlin Dar.

               The man seated closest to Caithlin slowly swivels his head
               in her direction. He wearily extracts himself from his
               chair and comes forward. He's a Terran (specifically,
               an Englishman) named ST. JOHN TALBOT. Thin and dissipated,
               alcoholic, Talbot is a veteran of the diplomatic corps. He
               pats down his unruly hair and straightens his soiled suit.
               He gives Caithlin a tired smile and extends a limp hand.

                                   TALBOT
                         Ah, yes. Our new Romulan
                         representative.
                                   (continuing)
                         Welcome to Paradise City, my
                         dear, capital of the so-called
                         "Planet of Galactic Peace." I'm
                         St John Talbot, the Federation
                         representative here on Nimbus III.
                         My charming companion here is the
                         Klingon consul, Korrd...

               Caithlin regards the hulking figure at the other end of
               the table. KORRD is an old, overweight Klingon, a
               once-great warrior past his prime. He doesn't rise
               to greet Caithlin. Instead, he takes a swig from a
               flagon and emits an earth-shaking belch.

                                   CAITHLIN
                         I expect that's Klingon for hello.

                                   TALBOT
                         Won't you come in, my dear?

          33   EXT. PARADISE CITY

               J'onn clambers over a dune with determination. He aims
               his gun as Sybock and his mount ride majestically to the
               top of the dune and continue on, followed by Sybok's
               soldiers, a virtual army of ragged settlers - aliens of
               every different race, the poor and the downtrodden - united
               in their devotion to Sybok.

          34   INT. BACK ROOM - SALOON

                                   CAITHLIN
                         Twenty years ago, our three
                         governments agree to develop this
                         planet together.

               Korrd pours a drink from a bottle into his cup.

                                   KORRD
                         Hmmm...

                                   CAITHLIN
                         A new age was born.

                                   TALBOT
                    Our new age has died a quick death.
                                   (continuing)
                         And the settlers we conned into
                         coming here - they were the dregs
                         of the galaxy. They immediately
                         took to fighting amongst themselves.
                         We forbade them weapons and they
                         soon began to fashion their own.

                                   CAITHLIN
                         Well then, it appears I've arrived
                         just in time.

               Korrd looks confused.

                                   KORRD
                         Mmmm...

               There are shouts from outside and the whine of a warning
               KLAXON.

               EXT. PARADISE CITY

               A handful of sentries brace themselves against the gate.
               It suddenly gives way. CAMERA CRANES UP OVER the top of
               the arch to reveal Sybok's army on the threshold of the
               city. In their midst, towering majestically above them,
               is Sybok on horseback. He urges his mount forward. With
               quiet determination, he and his army pour under the arch
               and proceed up the main drag.

               Townspeople scurry for protection, anticipating an attack.
               Those who consider challenging Sybok are allayed by the
               crude weapons and intimidating looks of the followers.
               Sybok intends to take this town by show of force without
               having to fire a shot. And it looks like he'll succeed.

          36   EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SALOON

               Korrd, Caithlin and Talbot emerge to see what the hubbub
               is about. When they see the approaching forces, Korrd
               and Talbot immediately turn tail and run back inside.
               After a moment, Caithlin follows.

          37   INT. SALOON

               Korrd, fearing the worst, goes behind the bar and opens
               a bottle. He upends it and pours the contents down his
               throat. He prefers to die drunk.

               Talbot and Caithlin hurry to the viewscreen. Talbot
               moves to turn off the program being broadcast.

                         TELEVISION ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
                         ....we have spared no expense to
                         create the closest thing to....

               Caithlin and Talbot wait as a communications screen rises
               in front of them. The saloon doors are forced open. J'onn
               rushes in.

                                   J'ONN
                         Get away from that transmitter!

               Korrd lifts his drink. J'onn grabs him; Korrd pushes back.
               CAMERA PANS to reveal two armed soldiers who grab Korrd and
               hold him. The KLAXON winds down to eerie silence as Sybok
               enters, observing the action. He is followed by several
               soldiers.

                                   SYBOK
                         (appraising them one by one)
                         Romulan. Terran. Klingon.
                         Consider yourselves my prisoners.

                                   TALBOT
                                   (scoffing)
                         Prisoners? We're already prisoners
                         on this worthless lump of rock.
                         What possible value could we be
                         to you?

                                   SYBOK
                         Nimbus III may be a worthless lump
                         of rock, but it does have one
                         unique treasure. It's the only
                         place in the entire galaxy that
                         has the three of you.

                                   CAITHLIN
                              (to Sybok; boldly)
                         I don't know who you are or what you
                         want but I can tell you this: our
                         governments will stop at nothing to
                         insure our safety.

                                   SYBOK
                              (with a smile)
                         That's exactly what I'm counting on.

               On Caithlin's confused look..               

               CUT TO :

          38   EXT. SPACE - EARTH - SPACEDOCK

               Hanging in space like a big Christmas ornament. The
               big blue marble called Earth is visible in the distance.

          39   INT. SPACEDOCK

               A huge, cavernous area designed as a high-and-dry for
               space vessels. Among this warehouse of ships is the one
               we know best - U.S.S.ENTERPRISE; NCC-1701-A.

                                   SCOTTY'S VOICE
                         U.S.S. Enterprise, shakedown cruise
                         report. I think this new ship was
                         put together by monkeys. She's got
                         a fine engine, but half the doors
                         won't open. And guess whose job it
                         is to make it right?

          40   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

               A meager repair crew lazily overhauls consoles and
               monitors. Some things work, most do not. One thing
               that does work is CHIEF ENGINEER MONTGOMERY SCOTT who
               looks up as COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER UHURA enters,
               stepping around cables.

                                   SCOTTY
                         (grumbling to himself; as he rises)
                         Borgus Frat.

                                   SCOTTY
                         (continuing; grumbling to himself)
                         "Let's see what she's got," said
                         the Captain. And then we found out,
                         didn't we?

                                   UHURA
                         I know you'll whip her into shape,
                         Scotty. You always do.

                                   SCOTTY
                                   (realizing)
                         Uhura, I thought you were on leave.

                                   UHURA
                         And I thought we were supposed to
                         be going together.

                                   SCOTTY
                              (indicating the ship)
                         Oh, I cannot leave her now when
                         she needs me the most.

                                   UHURA
                         I had a feeling you would say
                         something like that. So I brought
                         us dinner.

               She holds up small modernistic food packs. Scotty takes
               one.

                                   SCOTTY
                                   (touched)
                         Oh, lassie, you're the most
                         understanding woman I know.

               The bridge light starts to flash red. An ear-splitting
               KLAXON SOUNDS.

                                   COMPUTER VOICE
                         Red, Red, Red Alert. Red Alert.

                                   (exasperated)
                         I just fixed that damn thing.

               A man enters in b.g. carrying a cable over his shoulder.

                                   SCOTTY
                              (continuing, to man)
                         Turn it off, will you?

               Two men look at the console with concern.

                                   COMMAND VOICE
                         Red Alert. Red Alert. This is a

               Uhura goes to her console, punches a button and responds.

                                   UHURA
                         This is Enterprise. Identify 
                         yourself.

                                   COMMAND VOICE
                         Enterprise, this is Starfleet. We

                         Scotty, this is for real.

                         They can't be serious. The ship's
                         in pieces and we've less than a
                         skeleton aboard.

          41   EXT. EARTH - FOREST - DAY

               COMMANDERS SULU and CHEKOV tramp through dense woods.
               From their weary expressions it's clear they've been
               hiking a long time. Sulu leads the way. Chekov trudges
               behind him.

                                   CHEKOV
                         Admit it. We're lost.

                                        SULU
                         All right, we're lost.
                                   (with a smile)
                         But we're making good time.

               Sulu's communicator BEEPS.

                         Commander Sulu, come in, please.

                         I don't believe this.

                         Commander Sulu here.

          42   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE (INTERCUT)

               Uhura studies a monitor showing Sulu and Chekov as two
               blips on a grid.

                                   UHURA
                         Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's

                         Return to prearranged coordinates
                         for pickup.

               Sulu and Chekov look at each other.

                                   CHEKOV
                                   (whispering)
                         Don't tell them you're lost. You'll
                         never live it down.

                         Um... yes. We've been caught in
                         a blizzard!

                                   CHEKOV
                              (playing along)
                         And we can't see a thing. Request
                         you direct us to the coordinates.

               Chekov provides blizzard noises.

               On Enterprise, Uhura listens to the "blizzard" and checks
               her graphics display for weather report. She smiles.

                         Sulu! Look! The sun's come out!
                         It's a miracle!

                         shuttlecraft to pick you up.

                                        SULU
                         Uhura, I owe you one. Sulu out.

          43   EXT. YOSEMITE - CAMPSITE - NIGHT

               McCoy stands over a blazing campfire. A covered pot
               simmers on the coals. McCoy rings a TRIANGLE. He's
               slightly tipsy.

                                        McCoy
                                   (calling out)
                         Come and get it! Com and get it!

               CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Kirk and Spock seated two
               feet away.

                                        KIRK
                         Knock it.. knock it... Bones...
                         Bones.. knock it off. We're
                         right here. And we're starving.

               McCoy grins and crouches beside the covered pot. He revels
               in their undivided attention. With a flourish, he whips
               the lid off the pot to reveal a steaming mess of beans.

                                   SPOCK
                         Bi-podal seeds, Doctor?

                                        McCOY
                         Beans, Spock. But no ordinary beans.
                         These are from an old Southern recipe
                         handed down to me by my father. And
                         if you stick your Vulcan nose up at
                         these, you're not only insulting me,
                         but generations of McCoy's.

               McCoy ladles out the beans.

                                   SPOCK
                         In that case, I have little choice
                         but to sample your... beans.

               Kirk tears into his. Spock tries a forkful. He finds
               the taste strangely exciting.

                                   SPOCK
                                   (continuing)
                         Mmmm. Surprisingly good. It does
                         have a flavoring I'm not familiar
                         with.

                                        McCoy
                         Ah, that's the secret ingredient.

               Spock eats with enthusiasm.

                                        KIRK
                         You got any more of that secret
                         ingredient, Bones?

                                        McCOY
                         Be my guest.

                                        KIRK
                                   Thank you.

               McCoy grins and pulls out a bottle of bourbon. Spock
               stops in mid-chew and McCoy fills Kirk's cup.

                                   SPOCK
                         Am I to understand that your
                         secret ingredient is.. alcohol?

                                        McCOY
                         Whiskey. Tennessee whiskey, Spock.
                         You care for a little snort?

                                        KIRK
                         Bourbon and beans, an explosive
                         combination.
                                   (McCoy laughs)
                         Think Spock can handle it?

                                   McCOY
                         Are you kidding? With that Vulcan
                         metabolism, he could eat a bowl of
                         termites and it wouldn't bother him.

                                   SPOCK
                         As you are so fond of pointing out,
                         Doctor, I am half human.

                                   McCOY
                         Well, it certainly doesn't show.

                                   SPOCK
                                   Thank you.

                                        McCOY
                         How do you like that - this guy
                         never changes. I insult him and
                         he takes it as a compliment.
                              (drinks from bottle)
                         Mmmm.

                         You know, you two could drive a
                         man to drink.

                         What did you do? You really piss
                         me off, Jim. Human life is far too
                         precious to risk crazy stunts.
                         Maybe it didn't cross that macho
                         mind of yours, but you should've
                         been killed when you fell off that
                         mountain.

                         It crossed my mind.

                         And?

                         you were with me.

                         I don't understand.

                         It's a mystery to me what draws us
                         together. All that time in space
                         - getting on each other's nerves.
                         And what do we do when shore leave
                         comes along?
                                   (laughs)
                         We spend it together. Other people
                         have families.

                         Other people, Bones. Not us.

               They dwell on this thought for a moment. Then, Kirk
               notices that Spock has removed a sack from his backpack.
               Spock reaches into the sack and takes out a marshmallow
               which he attaches to the end of a pointed stick.

                         I am preparing to toast a marsh
                         melon.

               Marsh melon? Kirk and McCoy hide their smiles as Spock
               holds the marshmallow over the fire.

                                        McCOY
                         Well, I'll be damned. A marsh
                         melon. Where'd you learn to do
                         that?

                                   SPOCK
                         Before leaving the ship, I consulted
                         the computer library to familiarize
                         myself with the customs associated
                         with "camping out."

               Kirk and McCoy play along, amused by Spock's dead serious
               approach to frivolity.

                                        McCOY
                         Well, tell me, Spock. What do you
                         do after we toast the marsh - er,
                         marsh melons?

                                   SPOCK
                         We consume them.

                         after that.

                         Oh. I believe we are required to
                         engage in a ritual known as the
                         singalong.

                         That's great. I haven't sung around
                         a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa.
                         What are we going to sing? What...
                         Bones, what are we going to sing?

                         That song did not come up in my
                         research, Captain.

                         The lyrics are - are very simple.
                         It's, er, "Row, row, row your boat,
                         gently down the stream. Merrily,
                         merrily, merrily, merrily, life is
                         but a dream.." The Doctor and I will
                         start it off, and then when we give
                         you the signal, you jump in.
                                   (to McCoy)
                         Doctor, if you please.

               McCoy takes a hit of booze and clears his throat.

                         Don't say I didn't warn you.

               McCoy starts to sing. Kirk joins in. Maybe it's the
               bourbon, but the two of them sound pretty good.

                         merrily, merrily, merrily, life
                         is but a dream..."

               They signal Spock that it is his turn to jump in but the
               Vulcan merely regards them quizzically. The singalong
               grinds to a halt.

          45   EXT. SPACE

               A NASA Pioneer probe trumbles through space. Ancient,
               forgotten, the device is flotsam. O it's side is a
               plaque showing images of two humans and simple
               mathematical and scientific symbols. It comes PAST
               CAMERA and OUT OF SHOT. In the distance, a distortion
               appears and out of this distortion, a Klingon Bird of
               Prey materializes.

          46   INT. BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE

               Doors separate to admit KLAA, the Bird of Prey's
               swashbuckling young Captain. He is met by VIXIS, his
               First Officer, a statuesque Klingon female. It's clear
               she adores Klaa.

                                   VIXIS
                         (in Klingon; subtitled)
                         (Captain Klaa, we have a target
                         in sight. A probe of ancient
                         origin.)

                                        KLAA
                         (n Klingon; subtitled)
                         (Difficult to hit?)

                                   VIXIS
                         (in Klingon; subtitled)
                         (Most difficult.)

                         (in Klingon; subtitled)
                         (Good.)

               Klaa's crew watches with excitement as their Captain
               straps himself into his command chair which has been
               equipped with an elaborate gunner's rig allowing Klaa
               to do the shooting himself.

                                        KLAA
                         (continuing; in Klingon; subtitled)
                         (All weapons to my control)

               A periscope-like device swings into position in front
               of Klaa's flashing eyes.

                                        KLAA
                         (continuing; in Klingon; subtitled)
                         (Scope!)

          47   PERISCOPE - KLAA'S POV

               The probe is a tiny travelling speck in the distance. It's
               course is erratic.

          48   EXT. SPACE

               The probe tumbles through space as the Bird of Prey swoops
               down for the attack. Machine gun-like phasers are mounted
               on the Bird's wings. They come to life and swivel,
               BLASTING a flange off the front of the probe. A SECOND
               BLAST destroys a fin on the rear of the craft. A THIRD
               SHOT blows away the antennae. Klaa is toying with the
               target. He hesitates, then finishes the probe off.

          49   INT. BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE

               Vixis and anther crewman stand by, admiring their
               Captain and his deadly skill. But Klaa seems dissatisfied.

                                        KLAA
                         (in Klingon; subtitled)
                         (Shooting space garbage is no test
                         of a warrior's mettle. I need a
                         target that fires back.)

                                   VIXIS
                         (in Klingon; subtitled)
                         (Captain, new data. Hostages on
                         Nimbus III.)

               Klaa unstraps himself from the command chair and joins
               Vixis at a monitor screen. The fearsome face of a KLINGON
               COMMANDER fills the screen and starts barking Klingon over
               shots of Nimbus III and the Paradise outpost. It's clear
               that the Bird of Prey is being ordered to Nimbus III.
               Klaa and Vixis are charged with excitement.

                                   VIXIS

               CUT TO :

          50   YOSEMITE - NIGHT

               A blinding light, a ball of great intensity, sets down
               on the edge of the campsite, rounding Kirk, Spock and
               McCoy from sleep.

                                   McCOY
                         Get that damn light out of my
                         face!

               The three men rise and watch as a figure in silhouette
               emerges from the light and comes forward. It's Uhura.

                                   UHURA
                         Mr. Scott apologizes for having
                         to send the shuttlecraft. The
                         transporter beam is non-operational.
                         Captain, we've received important
                         orders from Starlet Command.

                         Why didn't you beep my

                                   UHURA
                         ER... You forgot to take it with
                         you.

               Uhura hands Kirk his communicator. It's clear he left
               it behind on purpose.

          51   EXT. EL CAPITAN - NIGHT

               The bright light leaves the deserted campsite and rises
               against the mountain. It turns TOWARD CAMERA and reveals
               itself as a sleek shuttlecraft of impressive design. Aft
               thrusters fire and it shoots skyward.

          52   EXT. SPACE - ANGLE - ENTERPRISE

               The ship is seen in her shining glory above Earth, framed
               against a full moon. The approaching Galileo shuttlecraft
               is dwarfed by the magnificent starship.

          53   INT. GALILEO 5 SHUTTLECRAFT

               This is the Galileo 5, capable of transporting two dozen
               personnel. At the moment its passengers are Kirk, Spock,
               McCoy and Uhura, who pilots the craft.

               Kirk gazes fondly at the Enterprise.

          55   CONTROL BOOTH OVERLOOKING LANDING BAY

               Bay doors open to receive Galileo. The tractor beam
               locks onto the shuttlecraft and slowly pulls her
               inside. It's a delicate maneuver. Even with wings
               retracted, the Galileo clears the doors with only a few
               feet on either side.

          56   CONTROL BOOTH OVERLOOKING LANDING BAY

               Scotty operates the controls.

          57   BAY AND STAGING AREA

               The shuttlecraft comes in for a smooth landing. Its
               side hatch opens to allow Kirk and company to exit.
               There's no one to greet them, just a few crewmen
               scurrying around. Scotty appears. He may be exhausted
               and covered with grime but he's in his element.

               A WHOOSH but only half the automatic door slides open.

               An ATTRACTIVE YEOMAN comes forward with the jacket of
               Kirk's uniform. He shrugs off his camping jacket as
               Uhura and Spock go to their stations. McCoy shakes his
               head at the noisy, messy bridge.

               Kirk looks at a wall console which begins shorting out.
               A crewman lies beneath it as sparks begin to fly. The
               crewman hits his head on the wall console; more sparks.

               Kirk takes his captain's uniform jacket from the Yeoman.

               reveal the veiwscreen. Kirk points, indicating the
               static on the screen.

               The Yeoman and a crewman stand near a toolkit which topples
               over. Kirk is beginning to get aggravated.

          64   ANOTHER PART OF THE GALAXY

               The Bird of Prey slices through the fabric of space
               headed for Nimbus III.

          65   INT. BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE

               Klaa paces his deck like a restless buccaneer, eager for
               confrontation. Vixis approaches.

                                   VIXIS

                         warrior in the galaxy.)

               This fact isn't lost on Klaa.

               The crew hops to it. Klaa turns to Vixis and gives her
               the chest-thumping Klingon salute.

               As the ship comes PAST CAMERA, we move in on a single
               window in the forward area of the dish.

          70   INT. ENTERPRISE - FORWARD OBSERVATION ROOM

               A vast area designed for contemplation. The most
               arresting feature is an antique ship's wheel - the
               kind Horatio Hornblower might have steered. The wheel
               stands in front of tall curving windows that offer an
               impressive space vista.

               Spock is beside the wheel staring at the stars, lost in
               thought. Kirk and McCoy enter with urgency and approach
               Spock, interrupting is reverie. Throughout the following,

                         Let's go.

               He and Sulu rise and walk to McCoy at the sliding doors.

          74   ANGLE ON CHEKOV

               He turns toward the veiwscreen where Nimbus III is seen.

          75   EXT. SPACE - NIMBUS III

               The shuttlecraft Galileo 5 streaks toward the planet's
               surface, deploying wings as it enters the atmosphere.

          76   INT. GALILEO

               Low-combat lighting. Sulu occupies the pilot's
               seat. Nearby are Uhura and seven Enterprise crewmen.
               Kirk and Spock are huddled over a graphics screen.
               They are dressed in field uniform. Phasers and transparent
               shields have been dispensed.

                                   SPOCK
                         Their equipment is primitive
                         but effective. I recommend we land
                         at Coordinate 8563.

                                   KIRK
                         That puts us pretty far away from
                         Paradise City.

                                   SPOCK
                         To land any closer would risk
                         detection.

                         aye, sir.

          77   EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

               The shuttlecraft swoops out of the dark sky and skims
               the surface of Nimbus III. The CAMERA PANS the
               desolate terrain.

          78   EXT. PARADISE CITY

               The ramshackle of buildings of Paradise City are illuminated
               by the light of two moons hanging overhead.

                         This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking.
                         You are in violation of Neutral Zone 
                         Treaty. I advise you to release
                         your hostages at once or suffer the
                         consequences.

                         Your threats amuse me, Captain
                         Chekov. What consequences did you
                         have in mind?

               The shuttlecraft swivels as it lands. The doors open
               revealing its crew. Kirk leads them from the craft.

                         Even as we speak, a Klingon
                         warship is on its way. We estimate

                         I imagine the Klingons will be
                         quite angry.

                         You are a master of understatement.
                         They are likely to destroy the planet.

                                   SYBOK
                         Then it's fortunate that I have you
                         and your starship to protect me.
                         In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I
                         instruct you and your First Officer
                         to beam down to my coordinates.

                              CHEKOV'S IMAGE
                         We will be happy to beam down.
                         But first we must have certain
                         assurances.

               Galileo lies behind a dune. The light of Paradise City
               are glimpsed over the rise, a mile off. Kirk and Spock
               lie on a dune with night vision binoculars. There's
               nothing between them but flat expanse.

          85   EXT. OASIS - NIGHT

               A BAND OF RAGTAG SOLDIERS gathers around a campfire.
               They are six in number, all men, members of Sybok's
               force. They are heavily robed to retard the night chill.
               They chat and drink. Nearby, their horses slip from a
               meager spring.

               A BLACK SOLDIER lifts his head and smiles as a woman's
               SONG floats out of the darkness- soft and mysterious,
               seductive. The soldiers look at each other in surprise,
               then rise en masse to seek the scource of the singing.
               The Black Soldier rises and steps toward the SOUND.
               Another soldier joins him.

          86   THIER POV

               In the distance, atop a dune and silhouetted against the
               low hanging twin moons... a female. But not just any
               female. This siren undulates as she sings, moving
               sensuously.

          87   CLOSER SHOT

               It's Uhura.

          88   THE SOLDIERS

               Drawn like moths to a flame. The Black Soldier rises;
               they stumble over each other to get a closer look,
               climbing on hands and knees up the steep dune where
               Lorelei Uhura waits at the top.

                                   BLACK SOLDIER
                         What is that?

               As the soldiers continue to climb the dune toward
               Uhura, two Enterprise crewmen enter and point their
               phasers at them. Other crewmen lie in the sand flanking
               Uhura's dancing feet. The Soldiers, taken by surprise,
               stop mid-climb.

                                   UHURA
                         Hello, boys... I've always wanted
                         to play to a captive audience.

               Snarling horses pound over a rise, sending sand in all
               directions. Riders hurtle PAST CAMERA with flowing
               capes and cowled faces. Ahead of them, Paradise City.
               Behind them, the desert - a sea of darkness.

          90   ANGLE - KIRK AND SPOCK

               Kirk rides with determination, his face nearly hidden
               behind a burnoose. He looks over at the rider beside
               him. It's Spock, bouncing stiffly in the saddle, doing
               all he can to hang on.

               Armed sentries watch from the walls as the scruffy band
               of horsemen crosses the desert. J'onn, Sybok's first
               convert, appears looking concerned.

                                   J'ONN
                         Open the gate. It's our lookout

               The huge iron gate swings open.

          92   ANGLE - THE HORSEMEN

               They gallop at full tilt, led by Kirk. He shouts
               frantically to the sentries.

                         Federation soldiers right behind
                         us. Close the gate!

               As Kirk and his party gallop through, the gate is closed
               behind them.

          93   INT. PARADISE - MAIN STREET

               Kirk and company proceed up the street, coaxing their

               They ride slowly, not wanting to attract more any more
               attention than they have.

               Occasionally a crew member drops away from the group
               and dismounts, taking a position where he can lay down
               cover for the eventual escape.

          94   ANGLE - THE HORSEMEN

               Kirk's eyes sweep around. There are soldiers on most
               of the rooftops, heavily armed and dangerous-looking.

                         Hold your horse, Captain. I'm

                         The hostages are in the structure
                         just ahead.

               Hiding it from view, Kirk raises a communicator to his
               lips.

                                   KIRK

               While the others watch the desert, J'onn turns to watch
               the horsemen.

                                   J'ONN
                                   (suspicious)
                         Who are you?

               J'onn rushes to the big spotlight anchored on the wall.
               He swings its bright beam in the direction of the
               horsemen.

          96   STREET

               Sulu and Kirk are revealed as the light sweeps across
               them. Kirk and the others turn and react to the light,
               realizing the jig is up.

                                   KIRK
                                   (shouting)

                         mounts! Sulu - take out that
                         light!

                                   SULU
                         Yes, Captain.

               The crewmen dismount and whip out the phaser rifles
               they've hidden under their robes.

          97   ANGLE - SULU

               Sulu spears his horse and charges at the spotlight as
               pebbles fired from the enemy's crude weapons whiz around
               him like hungry hornets. He gallops toward the blinding
               light. A BAZOOKA SHELL EXPLODES near him and he is
               knocked from his mount, but manages to roll away toward
               the spotlight and rises up to his knees. He raises his
               phaser and with an expert shot, blows the spotlight to
               bits as J'onn holds it. The street goes dark, lit now
               by neon and the flash of gunfire and phasers.

          98   INT. SALOON

               Sybok reacts to the gunfire.

                         It wasn't bloodshed I wanted.

               Sybok turns and strides out of the room, his robes
               swirling around him.

          99   EXT. STREETS OF PARADISE - A SERIES OF SHOTS

               A symphony of smoke and gunfire. Dizzying action.
               Running figures. Stampeding horses.

               ANGLE - KIRK

               Kirk dismounts; his horse runs off. A soldier rushes
               in and thrusts his weapon at Kirk, who grabs it and
               strikes the man in the face. He knocks him O.S. and
               takes the weapon.

          101  LOW ANGLE

               The soldiers on the walls and rooftops open fire with
               their crude weapons. The Enterprise crewmen fight back
               from strategic positions along the street, expertly
               picking off the enemy and using their transparent shields
               to repel the volley of pebbles.

     102   A BLINDING EXPLOSION

     103   ANGLE - KIRK

               A soldier grabs Kirk; they struggle. Kirk flips him
               OUT OF SHOT. Another soldier hurries in shooting as
               he climbs over a wall. Other crewmen hit still more
               soldiers with phaser fire. They scream and fall.

     104   ANGLE - SPOCK

               The Vulcan dismounts. As he heads for the saloon AN
               ENEMY SOLDIER leaps from a balcony, landing squarely in
               the saddle of Spock's horse. Armed with a sword the
               Soldier urges the steed forward to trample Spock. As Spock
               turns in response, the Soldier rears the horse up on its
               hind legs. Hooves threaten to pummel Spock to a hamburger.

               Spock calmly reaches up and presses his fingers into the
               horse's neck, executing a Vulcan nerve pinch. The horse
               and its rider tumble to the ground as Spock walks off.

     105   ANGLE - KIRK

               He stands in the doorway, back-lit by an inner bright light.

               Uhura is at the controls.

                                   UHURA
                         Roger. Coming in.

     107   EXT. ROOFTOP

               Sybok's soldiers set up a multiple pipe weapon cranked
               like a Gattling gun. Like the other weapons, it uses
               pebbles for bullets. One of them catches an Enterprise
               crewman in the leg. He goes down.

     108   ANGLE - KIRK

               Kirk shoots his phaser toward the lights of the building
               housing the saloon. The lights EXPLODE.

     109   INT. SALOON

               Dark and empty. Phaser drawn, Kirk cautiously makes his
               way across the room when, with a sudden hiss, the Dancing
               Catwoman leaps over the bar and pounces on his back. As
               she claws at him, Kirk twirls her around in an "airplane
               spin" and throws her the length of the room. The
               Catwoman lands in the "pool" table, sending up a wave
               of water that soaks the walls.

     110   ANGLE

               Spock enters and reacts to the unconscious floating
               Catwoman as Kirk blasts open the door to the back room.

               Caithlin, Korrd and Talbot look up in surprise. Kirk
               breathes a sigh of relief.

     111   ANGLE - SPOCK

               Spock appears at Kirk's side.

     112   ANGLE - THE HOSTAGES

               Kirk signals for the hostages to follow them. But the
               hostages confound them by pointing three crude pistols
               at their heads.

                                   CAITHLIN

                                   (laughs)

     113   EXT. PARADISE - STREET

               Kirk and Spock are marched out off the saloon by the
               hostages. The rest of the Enterprise crew is herded
               together to the accompaniment of thunderous cheers from
               Sybok's soldiers.

                                   SYBOK
                              (smiling at J'onn; 
                              over their cheers)
                         Well done, my friends.

               An armed soldier pushes Uhura toward a smiling Sybok and
               J'onn.

     114   ANGLE - SPOCK

               As the cheers begin to die, Spock detaches himself from
               Kirk and McCoy. Sybok notices him. For the first time
               we see him vulnerable.

                                   SYBOK
                         Spock. It's me. It's Sybok.
                         After all these years, you've
                         finally caught up with me.
                         Don't you have anything to say
                         to me?

               It's clear Sybok is trying to force an emotional reaction
               from Spock. But Spock refuses to fall into his trap.

                                   SPOCK
                         You are under arrest for seventeen
                         violations of the Neutral Zone
                         Treaty.

               Sybok is incredulous. There must be a hundred guns pointed
               at Spock's heart. Sybok can't help it. He chuckles.
               The chuckle becomes a full rich laugh. The soldiers join
               in and soon their laughter is ringing through Paradise.

                                   SYBOK
                         Spock, you've developed a sense 
                         of humor after all.

                                   SPOCK
                         It was not my intention to amuse
                         you. These are serious charges.
                         However, if you surrender now-

                                   SYBOK
                         I'm sorry, Spock. I can't
                         surrender now. I'm not through
                         violating Neutral Zone Treaty.
                         In fact, I'm just getting started.
                         And now for my next violation I intend
                         to steal something. Something
                         very big.

               J'onn and several soldiers laugh and cheer.

                                   SYBOK
                                   (continuing)
                         I must have your starship.

                                   KIRK
                         (stepping forward as 
                                   he realizes)
                         You staged all this to get your
                         hands on my ship?

               Sybok regards Kirk in his grubby commando outfit.

                                   SYBOK
                         Who are you?

                                   KIRK
                         James T. Kirk, Captain of the 
                         Enterprise.

                                   SYBOK
                         But I thought Captain Chekov..
                                   (realizing)
                         I see. Very clever, Captain.
                         (turning t Spock with excitement)
                         Spock, it would appear that you've
                         been given a second chance to join
                         me. What do you say?

                                   SPOCK
                         I am a Starfleet Officer.

                                   SYBOK
                         Of course. Of course. Then I'll
                         take the ship without your help.

               The soldiers cheer wildly, waving their weapons in the
               air.

                         Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of

                         DO it. Go to Red Alert.

               Scotty punches in commands. On his graphics screen a
               series of dots winks on around an outline of the ship.

               Sybok regards Kirk with suspicion. He turns to Spock,
               the only one he can trust.

     127   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

               Chekov and Scotty exchange confused looks.

                                   CHEKOV
                              (aside to Scotty)
                         What's Emergency Landing Plan B?

                                   SCOTTY
                         I don't have a clue.

                                   KIRK'S VOICE
                         B as in "barricade."

                                   SCOTTY
                                   (alarmed)
                         He can't be serious.

     128   EXT. SPACE - ANGLE - ENTERPRISE AND GALILEO

               The shuttle draws closer.

     129   INT. GALILEO

               Enterprise looms through the windshield.

                                   SYBOK
                         What are you doing?

                                   KIRK
                         In order to lower and raise the
                         shields as quickly as possible, we're
                         going to forego the tractor beam and
                         fly her in manually.

                                   McCOY
                                   (horrified)
                         Manually?

                                   SYBOK
                                   (to Sulu)
                         How often have you done this?

                                   SULU
                         Actually it's my first attempt.

               Sybok looks at Kirk in amazement. Kirk smiles uneasily
               and indicates Sulu.

                                   KIRK
                         He's good. Really
                                   (then)
                         Scotty, on my mark. Open bay
                         doors.

     130   EXT. ENTERPRISE -FANTAIL

               With agonizing slowness, the bay doors begin to open.

     131   INT. BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE

               Klaa flexes his itchy trigger-finger and peers into his
               view scope.

     134   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

               Scotty punches in commands.

                                   SCOTTY
                         Lowering shields, sir.

               On Scotty's graphic's screen, the dots wink out around
               the outline of the ship. Enterprise is now vulnerable.

     135   EXT. SPACE

               The Bird of Prey materializes.

     136   INT. GALILEO

               The Klingon ship is sighted.

                                   UHURA
                         Bird of Prey bearing one zero

                         Go, Sulu.

               Sulu hits the aft thrusters and the shuttle roars to
               life.

     137   EXT. SPACE - ANGLE - ENTERPRISE AND GALILEO

               The shuttlecraft takes off with a tremendous kick. Like
               it was fired from a slingshot, the tiny craft closes the
               gap between itself and the Enterprise at alarming speed. But
               the bay doors - they haven't opened wide enough yet.
               Just when it looks like the Galileo will pulp itself on the
               fantail, she banks ninety degrees.

     138   INT. ENTERPRISE - LANDING BAY

               Galileo negotiates the narrow opening by coming in on its
               side. It skids down the runway, showering sparks all the
               way, unable to stop. To our surprise, a cargo net pops
               up to keep it from crashing into the retaining wall.

     139   INT. GALILEO

               As the shuttle recoils against the net, passengers are
               thrown about like rag dolls. Lights blow out and
               instrument panels EXPLODE.

     140   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

                                   SCOTTY

     141   INT. BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE

               Klaa gapes in surprise. The target has zoomed out of

               Klaa looks through the view scope, turns the firing

               One moment she's there, the next she's gone in a flash
               of blinding light. Klaa's shot goes to the void.

     145   INT. BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE

               Klaa reacts in amazement to Enterprise's sudden
               departure.

               As Vixis and her crew hop to it, CAMERA PUSHES IN on Klaa
               who throws off his gunner's rig, unable to hide his
               admiration for Kirk's cleverness.

                                   KLAA
                         (continuing; in Klingon; subtitled)

     146   INT. ENTERPRISE - LANDING BAY

               The badly-damaged Galileo lies smoldering on its side.

     147   INT. GALILEO

               In the smoking wreckage, passengers have been flung
               everywhere. No one's been killed but are all dazed
               or unconscious. Sybok and Kirk come to simultaneously.
               But before Kirk can act, Sybok snatches up a primitive
               shooting weapon and aims it at him.

                                   SYBOK
                         We must change our course at once.

                                   KIRK
                                   (crafty)
                         I'll take you to the bridge.

     148   INT. LANDING BAY

               The Galileo's back hatch blows open emitting a cloud of
               smoke along with Kirk and Sybok. As Sybok steps down
               behind him, Kirk whirls and grabs for the weapon. The
               two men struggle and tumble across the landing bay floor.

     149   ANGLE - KIRK AND SYBOK

               Kirk is no match for the Vulcan's superior strength but
               he fights with everything he's got. He manages to
               knock the weapon from Sybok's hand. It skitters across
               the floor and stops at the feet of Spock who has emerged
               from the shuttle.

               Spock looks down at the weapon, then back to Kirk whom
               Sybok is rendering helpless with one hand. With his
               incredible strength Sybok forces Kirk to the floor.

                                   KIRK
                                   (in pain)
                         Spock... pick it up!

               Spock obediently picks up the weapon like it was a
               distasteful object. Kirk collapses on the floor, conscious
               but no longer able to fight. Spock faces Sybok.

                                   SPOCK
                         Sybok, you must surrender.

                                   SYBOK
                         No. You must kill me.

               Sybok advances toward Spock until the weapon is pressing
               into Sybok's chest.

                                   KIRK
                                   (desperate)
                         Shoot him!

               But Spock can't shoot. The emotional price is too great.
               He lowers the weapon in shame and defeat. Sybok takes
               it from him with a smile.

                                   SYBOK
                         For a moment, I thought you might
                         actually do it.

     150   ANGLE

               Sybok's soldiers emerge from the wreckage of the shuttle
               with McCoy. The doctor hurries to Kirk and helps him to
               his feet. Kirk, in pain and betrayed, glares at Spock
               who cannot meet his eyes.

               Sybok turns to J'onn. He indicates Kirk and McCoy.

                                   SYBOK
                         Put him in the brig with Captain
                         Kirk.
                              (then, to Spock)
                         Spock, you will accompany me to
                         the bridge?

                                   SPOCK
                              (finding his voice)
                         No. I will not.

                                   SYBOK
                         You know I'm right.

               He is met by stony silence.

                                   SYBOK
                         (continuing; a long pause)
                         Then you must join them.

               J'onn and several other soldiers march Kirk, Spock and
               McCoy out.

     151   ANGLE - LANDING BAY

               Caithlin, Korrd and Talbot emerge from the shuttle with
               Sulu and Uhura in tow.

                                   KORRD
                         These two will be useful.

               Uhura and Sulu are defiant. Sybok approaches them.

                                   SYBOK
                         Give us a moment alone.

                                   CAITHLIN
                              (to Uhura and Sulu)

               Scotty witnesses the action on the deck below.
               Fortunately, no one sees him. He steps back into the

               Kirk, Spock and McCoy are shoved into a cell by J'onn.
               Phaser beam bars materialize to contain them. Kirk is
               enraged.

                         What you have done is betray
                         every man on this ship.

                                   SPOCK
                         Worse. I have betrayed you. I
                         do not expect you to forgive me.

                         You want me to hold him, Jim?

                         Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you
                         had to do was pull the trigger.

                                   SPOCK
                         If I had pulled the trigger, 
                         Sybok would be dead.

                                   KIRK
                         I ordered you to defend this ship.

                                   SPOCK
                         You ordered me to kill my brother.

                         Look, the man may be a fellow
                         Vulcan, but that doesn't...

                                   SPOCK
                         No, no, no, Captain. You do not
                         understand. Sybok also in a son
                         of Sarek.

               Kirk and McCoy can't believe it.

                                   KIRK
                         You mean he's your brother brother?

                         I did not.

                                   KIRK
                         You did too. Sybok couldn't
                         possibly be your brother because
                         I happen to know for a fact that
                         you don't have a brother.

                                   SPOCK
                         Technically, you are correct. I
                         do not have a brother.

                         Let me get this straight. You and
                         Sybok have the same father but
                         different mothers.

                                   SPOCK
                         Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's
                         mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon
                         her death, Sybok and I were raised
                         as brothers.

                         I was not disposed to discuss...
                         matters of a personal nature. For
                         that, I'm sorry.

                         Everything... that makes everything
                         all right. He's sorry, everything's...

                                   McCOY
                         Stop it, Jim. Spock could no more
                         kill his own brother than he could
                         kill you. If you want to punish
                         him for what he's done, why don't
                         you throw him in the brig?

               Kirk's anger burns itself out.

                         I'll say one thing, Spock. You
               never cease to amaze me.

               Scotty turns the corner and whacks his head on a low-

               Kirk starts to climb the emergency ladder. McCoy
               reluctantly follows. Spock watches. Then, unnoticed,
               he slips away.

               Kirk and McCoy look down. No Spock. Just then, a soft
               WHOOSHING SOUND from above. They look up.

               Spock descends wearing the levitation boots from Yosemite.
               He floats alongside Kirk and McCoy, hovering in midair.

               Kirk breaks into a smile of relief. He steps off the
               ladder and grabs onto Spock. They dip down a few feet,
               then slowly rise to a hovering position beside McCoy.

               Grumbling, a little fearful, McCoy steps on board. Their

               Spock hits the boosters. With an explosion of power and
               NOISE they shoot skyward like a bullet.

               Rocket smoke shoots downward enveloping Sulu and the

                         What you fear is the unknown. The
                         people of your planet once believed
                         their world was flat. Columbus
                         proved it was round. They said
                         the sound barrier could never be
                         broken. It was broken. They said
                         warp speed could not be achieved.
                         The Great Barrier is the ultimate
                         expression of this universal fear.
                         It's an extension of personal fear.

                         understanding. I want your
                         respect. Are you afraid to hear
                         me out?

                                   KIRK
                         I'm afraid of nothing.

               Sybok turns to J'onn and the soldiers.

                                   SYBOK
                         Wait outside.

               J'onn and the soldiers reluctantly withdraw. Sybok
               indicates for chairs, arranged in  circle.

                                   SYBOK
                                   (continuing)
                         I'm sure you have many questions
                         Here, amidst the stars of our own
                         galaxy, we shall seek the answers
                         together.

               The four men take their seats. The lighting becomes
               intimate. Sybok weaves his spell.

               CUT TO :

     179   INT. SICK BAY

               Scotty awakens to find Uhura holding him in her arms.

                                   UHURA
                                   (soothing)
                         Easy, easy,  easy, Scotty. Easy.
                         You're back with us.

                                   SCOTTY
                                   (testing her)
                         Uhura, I had the strangest dream.
                         I dreamt that a madman had taken
                         over the Enterprise.

                                   UHURA
                         Scotty, dear, he' not a madman.

                                   SCOTTY
                              (realizing she's
                                   a convert)
                         He's not?

                                   UHURA
                         No. Sybok has simply put us in
                         touch with feelings we've always
                         been afraid to express.

               Uhura gives Scotty loving look.

                                   SCOTTY
                                   (uncomfortable)
                         I.. er... have to get back the 
                         transporter.

               Scotty slips out of her arms.

                                   UHURA
                         No, no, no. Scotty - Scotty...
                         There's so much I want to tell you.

                                   SCOTTY
                         Maybe you could wait until I'm a
                         wee bit stronger I don't think
                         I could take it in my present
                         condition.
                              (under his breath)
                         Or yours.

               Scotty heads for the exit.

     180   INT. FOWARD OBSERVATION ROOM

               Beyond the windows, the swirling vastness of space.
               Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Sybok sit in a circle.

                                   SYBOK
                         Sha Ka Ree. "The Scource."
                         "Heaven." "Eden." call it
                         "Qui'Tu." To the Romulans, it's
                         "Vorta Vor." The Andorian word
                         is.. unpronounceable. Still, every
                         culture shares he common
                         dream of a place from which creation
                         sprang. For us, that place will
                         soon be a reality.

                                   KIRK
                         The only realty I see is that I'm
                         a prisoner on my own ship. What is
                         this power you have to control the
                         minds of my crew?

                                   SYBOK
                         I don't control minds. I free
                         them.

                                   McCOY
                         How?

                                   SYBOK
                         By making you face your pain and
                         draw strength from it. Once
                         that's done, fear cannot stop
                         you.

                                   McCOY
                         Sounds like brainwashing to me.

               Sybok closes his eyes and concentrates deeply.

                                   SYBOK
                              (to McCoy; sensing)
                         Your pain is the deepest of all.

                                   McCOY
                         What?

                                   SYBOK
                         I can feel it. Can't you?

               A city skyline materializes in the background.

                              MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                              (a whisper in pain)
                         Leonard...

                                   McCOY
                         It's some kind of trick.

                              MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                                   (imploring)
                         Leonard...

                                   McCOY
                              (as he recognizes
                                   the voice)
                         Father?

               The surrounding walls come alive with energy. What
               follows is theatrical in style as we enter a subjective
               world.

                                   McCOY
                              (continuing; frightened)
                         Oh my God, don't do this to me.

     181   ANGLE - McCOY

               He turns to find himself in a brilliantly white, sterile
               hospital room. A wasted figure reclines in a bed, an
               old man connected to a powerful life-support system.
               This is McCOY'S FATHER and we are somewhere in the past.

                                   FATHER
                                   (barely audible)
                         Leonard...

               McCoy rushes to the bedside.

                                   McCOY
                         I'm here. I'm with you, Dad.

                                   FATHER
                         The pain... stop the pain.

                                   McCOY
                         I've done everything I can do.
                         You've got to hang on.

                                   FATHER
                         I can't stand the pain. Help me.

               In the near background Sybok watches with Kirk and Spock.
               They are entranced by what they're seeing.

                                   McCOY
                         All my knowledge and I can't
                         save him.

                                   SYBOK
                                   (the voice of
                                   conscience)
                         You've done all you can. The
                         support system will keep him alive.

                                   McCOY
                                   (flaring)
                         You call this alive?

               Father whispers something. McCoy bends down and puts his
               ear next to the old man's parched lips.

                                   FATHER
                         Son, release me...

               McCoy looks into his Father's eyes. The old man's gaze
               travels to the support machinery. He wants McCoy to
               shut it off.

                                   McCOY
                                   (recoiling)
                         I can't do that, Dad.
                                   (in agony)
                         But how - how can I watch him
                         suffer like this?

                                   SYBOK
                         You're a doctor.

                                   McCOY
                                   (defiant)
                         I'm his son!

               McCoy reaches his decision. He shuts off the machine.
               The Father dies in his son's arms. Sybok appears at
               McCoy's side.

                                   SYBOK
                         Why did you do it?

                                   McCOY
                         To preserve his dignity.

                                   SYBOK
                         That wasn't the worst of it.

                                   McCOY
                         No.

                                   SYBOK
                         Was it?

                                   McCOY
                         No.

                                   SYBOK
                         Share it.

               McCoy hesitates, trembling. This is his dark secret.

                                   McCOY
                         Not long after... they found a
                         cure. A goddamn cure!

                                   SYBOK
                         So if you hadn't killed him he
                         might have lived.

                                   McCOY
                                   (breaking down)
                         No! I loved my father. I
                         released him.

                                   SYBOK
                         Then you did what you thought
                         was right.

                                   McCOY
                         Yes. No! Yes!

               Sybok holds McCoy. The CAMERA PUSHES IN as they hold
               each other.

                                   SYBOK
                         Release this pain.. Release it.
                         This pain has poisoned your soul
                         for a long time.

               Kirk and Spock look at each other with concern.

               McCoy weeps for several moments, then wipes the tears
               away. He looks up at Sybok's comforting smile and is
               filled with a deep sense of relief.

                                   SYBOK
                                   (continuing)
                         Now you've taken the first step.
                         The other steps we'll take together.

               McCoy nods. Sybok turns to Spock.

                                   SYBOK
                                   (continuing)
                         Each man's pain is unique.

                                   SPOCK
                         I hide no pain.

                                   SYBOK
                         I know you better than that.

                                   SPOCK
                                   (challenging)
                         Do you?

                                   KIRK
                         Spock... don't.

                                   SPOCK
                         It's all right, Captain.
                                   (to Sybok)
                         Proceed.

               O.S. a woman screams in agony.

     182   ANGLE - KIRK AND SPOCK

               They turn and find themselves beneath the hanging
               stalactites of a cave. Torchlight throws weird shadows
               on the walls. The shadows depict a woman in labor,
               attended by a Vulcan High Priestess. Ceremonial DRUMS
               pound a throbbing pulse. The woman lets out another
               scream. It reverberates throughout the cavern.

                                   KIRK
                         What is this?

                                   SPOCK
                         I believe we are witnessing my
                         birth.

               Sybok appears beside them. He leads Spock and Kirk into
               the past.

     183   ANGLE - AS THEY APPROACH

               Spock's mother, the young earthwoman AMANDA, lies on a 
               rough pallet, her legs spread beneath her robes, her
               distended stomach lifting. Her only attendant is THE
               HIGH PRIESTESS who intones the Vulcan birthrights.

               Spock watches.

               A figure steps from the shadows. It is SAREK, Spock's
               Vulcan father. He observes his wife with typical
               detachment.

               As the DRUMS build in intensity, Amanda begins to
               deliver.

     184   ANGLE - CAVERN WALL

               The birth takes place in shadow. DRUMS reach a climax
               and stop. An infant cries. Amanda lifts the mewling
               babe from between her legs.

     185   SPOCK

               Watching his entry into the world.

     186   HIGH PRIESTESS

               She takes the baby from Amanda and holds it up. The
               tiny infant kicks and cries. Amanda reaches out for
               her child but the Priestess turns and presents the
               crying baby to Sarek instead.

                                   SAREK
                                   (without joy)
                         So human.

     187   ANGLE - FORWARD OBSERVATION ROOM

               Spock turns away from Sybok and the others.

                                   KIRK
                         Spock...
                              (when he doesn't
                              reply, to Sybok)
                         What have you done to my friends?

                                   SYBOK
                         I've done nothing. This is who
                         they are. Didn't you know that?

               The question hits Kirk with force.

                                   KIRK
                                   (realizing)
                         No... I didn't.

                                   SYBOK
                         Now learn something about
                         yourself.

                                   KIRK
                         No. I refuse.

                                   (imploring)
                         Jim, try to be open about this.

                                   KIRK
                         About what? That I've made the
                         wrong choices in my life? That I
                         turned left when I should've turned
                         right? I know what my weaknesses
                         are. I don't need Sybok to take me
                         on a tour of them.

                                   McCOY
                         If you'd just unbend and allow
                         yourself - 

                                   KIRK
                         And be brainwashed by this con man?

                                   McCOY
                         I was wrong. This "con man" took
                         away my pain.

                                   KIRK
                         Damnit, Bones, you're a doctor.
                         You know that pain and guilt can't
                         be taken away with a wave of a 
                         magic wand. They're things we carry
                         with us - the things that make us
                         who we are. If we lost them, we
                         lose ourselves. I don't want my
                         pain taken away. I need my pain.

               A tense silence, broken by...

                                   UHURA'S VOICE
                         Sybok, this is the bridge. We're
                         in approach of the Great Barrier.

               Sybok is filled with excitement, eager to go to the
               bridge.

                                   SYBOK
                         Captain, I'm afraid you'll have
                         to remain here. Spock. Dr. McCoy...
                         Come with me.

               Sybok and McCoy start for the exit but stop when they
               realize that Spock is remaining with Kirk.

                                   SYBOK
                                   (puzzled)
                         Spock?

                                   SPOCK
                         I cannot go with you.

                                   SYBOK
                              (can't believe it)
                         Why not?

                                   SPOCK
                         I belong here.

                                   SYBOK
                         I don't understand...

                                   SPOCK
                         Sybok, you are my brother, but
                         you do not know me. I am not the
                         outcast boy you left behind those
                         many years ago. Since that time
                         I have found myself and my place.
                         I know who I am. And I cannot go
                         with you.

               McCoy reacts to this speech. After a moment, he takes
               his place with Kirk and Spock.

                                   McCOY
                         I guess you better count me out,
                         too.

               Beyond the great windows, space is hanging, reflecting
               this unique part of the galaxy.

               Sybok regards Kirk, Spock and McCoy with affection. This
               is only a temporary setback. He knows the ultimate win
               will be his.

                                   SYBOK
                         Then I'll see you on the other
                         side.

               Sybok heads for the exit. Doors WHOOSH open to reveal
               the guards outside.

                                   KIRK
                         Wait!
                                   (Sybok turns)
                         You know we'll never make it
                         through the Great Barrier.

                                   SYBOK
                         But if we do, will that convince
                         you that my vision was true?

                                   KIRK
                         Your vision?

                                   SYBOK
                         Given to me by God.
                                   (as the others
                                   react)
                         He waits for us on the other side.

                                   KIRK
                                   (stunned)
                         You are mad!

                                   SYBOK
                         Am I? We'll see.

               The fiery look in Sybok's eyes might be confidence, it
               might be madness. He turns and exits.

               CUT TO :

     188   EXT. SPACE - THE GREAT BARRIER

               Enterprise is poised on the edge of the giant star
               cluster known as the Great Barrier. It is visually
               stunning and equally dangerous. We see giant regions of
               star formations as well as expanding blast waves from
               exploding stars. Beams of radiation from pulsars sweep
               the tiny and insignificant ship, bathing her in color.

     189   INT. BRIDGE - ANGLE TO INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN

               Sybok is on the bridge. Uhura, Chekov and Sulu are at
               their stations. Caithlin, Korrd and Talbot are also
               present. They and the rest of the crew are transfixed
               by the viewscreen, awed by the vista of a sky filled
               with thousands of stars, each a fiery orange.

               But what really draws their attention is the black
               thundercloud looming directly ahead. Here starts the
               ring of gas and dust that enshrouds the center of the
               galaxy, hiding it from view. Behind this black veil
               is a region that emits ten times more energy than our
               sun. Through the chinks in the wall we see flashes of
               blue light - hints of the fires blazing within.

               The hip's monitor screen goes blank.

                                   SULU
                         They say no ship can survive this.

                                   SYBOK
                         I say they're wrong. I say the
                         danger is an illusion.

                                   CHEKOV
                         We have no instrument readings.
                         Is it there or isn't it?

                                   SYBOK
                         Mr. Sulu... full ahead.

                                   SULU
                         Full ahead, aye.

     190   EXT. SPACE - ANGLE - ENTERPRISE

               And with that, the ship plows into the Barrier, straight
               into the dark clouds, disappearing from sight. We HOLD
               for a terrifying moment, wondering if we'll ever see
               Enterprise again.

     191   INT. FORWARD OBSERVATION ROOM

               Kirk, Spock and McCoy experience a rush of elation.
               They gaze through the window at an incredible spacescape,
               unable to deny the sensation stirring within them.
               Sybok was right.

     192   ANGLE - INSIDE THE BARRIER

               Surprisingly, there is no turbulence, no buffeting.
               The Enterprise travels through a fantastic passageway
               of light and color. Then, quite suddenly, the gas
               clouds part and the ship enters a region of incredible
               calm and serenity, like the clear space at the eye of
               a hurricane.

     193   INT. BRIDGE

               Sybok rises and looks in awe at the Great Barrier.

     194   EXT. SPACE

               Dead ahead, a single planet. A planet of great beauty
               and peace. Our final destination.

     195   INT. BRIDGE

               Sybok smiles and glances around. Talbot stands in
               awe of the sight before him. CAMERA PUSHES IN on
               Caithlin's happy face.

     196   EXT. SPACE

               CAMERA PUSHES IN toward Sha Ka Ree.

                                   KIRK'S VOICE
                         Is it possible?

     197   INT. FORWARD OBSERVATION ROOM

                                   SPOCK
                         Fascinating.

                                   McCOY
                         Are we dreaming?

                                   KIRK
                         If we are, then life is a dream.

               Kirk, fascinated by the planet, moves to the antique
               ship's wheel. He absentmindedly rests his hand on it.
               His eyes are drawn to the plaque attached to the spokes
               of the wheel. On it, the charter of the Enterprise has
               been set in bronze. CAMERA MOVES IN on these words:

                    "TO BOLDLY GO WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE"

     198   INT. BRIDGE - ANGLE TO INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN

               The bridge buzzes with excitement. Monitor screens
               come to life.

                                   CHEKOV
                         Instruments are back on line.
                         Incredible. There's a power scource
                         emanating form the planet like
                         nothing I've ever seen.

               On the viewscreen, the planet appears up close  - a
               celestial orb, cloaked by swirling white clouds. 
               QUICK SHOTS of awed reactions:

                                   SYBOK
                         Sha Ka Ree.

                         Qui'Tu.

     199   ANGLE

               The bridge doors WHOOSH open to reveal Kirk, Spock and
               McCoy. The others turn, fearful of what he'll say or do. A
               tense moment.

                                   KIRK

                         The ship needs its Captain.

                         What makes you think I won't turn

                                   SYBOK
                         Because you, too, must know.

               Kirk looks at the hopeful faces around him. He feels
               the excitement of being on the verge of a great frontier,
               perhaps the greatest frontier.

                                   KIRK
                         Well, if we're going to do it...
                              (with conviction)
                         ... we're going to do by the

                         Spock, Dr. McCoy - come with me.
                         The rest of you remain on board
                         until I determine what we're
                         dealing with.

               Kirk's eyes flash with excitement. To Sybok:

                                   KIRK
                              (continuing; with
                                   a smile.)
                         Well, don't just stand there.
                         God's a busy man.

               Sybok happily joins them in the turbolift.

               CUT TO :

     200   EXT. ENTERPRISE

               Bay doors open. Copernicus, the shuttle backup, emerges
               and drops from the mothership. Thrusters fire as it
               streaks toward the planet, disappearing into the swirling
               white clouds.

     201   INT. COPERNICUS

               Spock pilots the craft. He, McCoy and Kirk have changed
               into Starfleet uniforms.

     202   THROUGH WINDSHEILD - PLANET BELOW

               Clouds part as if swept aside by hand. Beneath the
               shuttle a world opens up that can only be described
               as incredible.

     203   INT. COPERNICUS

               Sybok, Kirk, McCoy and Spock remain focused ahead,
               awestruck.

     204   EXT. PLANET

               Copernicus skims over a rich abundant landscape awash
               with bright primary colors.

     205   INT. COPERNICUS

               Spock removes his hands from the console.

                                   SPOCK
                         I am no longer in control of the
                         craft.

               Kirk, Spock and McCoy regard each other with wary
               excitement, then turn their attentions to what lies ahead.

     206   EXT. PLANET - POV SHOT

               A circle of peaks appears in the distance, rising against
               the sky.

     207   INT. COPERNICUS

               Sybok smiles at the others.

     208   EXT. PLANET

               Copernicus comes in for a soft landing.

     209   INT. COPERNICUS

               Engines switch off. Kirk slips a communicator into his
               belt. He's about to pick up a hand phaser when he feels
               Sybok's disapproving eye upon him.

                                   KIRK
                         All right. We'll play it your
                         way.

               He leaves the weapon behind.

     210   EXT. OUTSIDE SHUTTLE

               The exit hatch opens. Our four explorers emerge from
               the craft. They regard the prehistoric peaks with
               excitement.

                                   SYBOK
                         It's amazing. The land... the
                         sky... just as I knew it would be.

               They urgently start forward with Kirk leading the way.

     211   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

               Crew members abandon their posts and move forward to
               the viewscreen.

     212   EXT. PEAKS AND CRATER WITHIN - HIGH ANGLE SHOT

               Four tiny figures pass through the peaks and look down
               into a naturally formed amphitheater. It's nothing
               more than a rough crater carved in the summit, ringed
               by the peaks.

     213   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

               Uhura, eyes fixed on the viewscreen, speaks urgently
               into her speaker.

                                   UHURA
                         Scotty, you've got to see this.

     214   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOOM

               Scotty is hard at work.

                                   SCOTTY
                         I don't have the time. The Captain
                         told me to get this transporter
                         working and I'm not about to let
                         him down.

     215   EXT. PLANET

               Kirk walks around the base of the tall peak as the CAMERA
               PULLS BACK

     216   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

               While the crew marvels at the viewscreen, CAMERA PANS
               over to the defense station which is unattended.

               The screen blinks to life. A graphic of the Bird of
               Prey appears and a warning; "KLINGON VESSEL IN
               QUADRANT. RECOMMEND: ACTIVATION OF DEFENSE SYSTEMS.
               AWAITING COMMAND." A low warning BEEP. But no one's
               there to respond.

     217   EXT. AMPHITHEATER

               Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Sybok descend into the bowl of
               the crater. They reach the center and stop. They 
               look at each other, wondering, "Is this all there is?"
               Sybok tries to hide his disappointment. He looks around
               for a sign that isn't there, then, after a moment of
               deafening silence, he addresses their bleak surroundings.

                                   SYBOK
                              (shouting; a trace
                                   of desperation)
               We have traveled far by starship...

               Nothing. It looks like a bust. Sybok's voice chokes
               off and he lowers his head. Kirk and McCoy frown at
               each other. Kirk whips out his communicator to address
               the ship.

                                   KIRK
                         Enterprise, this is Kirk. We
                         have, er...

               Spock goes to Sybok and puts a comforting hand on his
               brother's shoulder.

                                   SPOCK
                         Sybok, perhaps, er...

               Spock's words are obscured by a rumble from within the
               earth. A shadow engulfs the amphitheater.

     218   ANGLE - THE SKY ABOVE

               Clouds turn ashen and threatening, transforming day
               into night.

     219   AMPHITHEATER

               The ground comes to life beneath the feet of our
               hero's. The earth buckles and ripples as if nature
               herself were trying to break free.

               Without warning a pillar of sheer rock rips through
               the surface and climbs skyward. Then another pillar
               shoots up, followed by another and another. They
               encircle the amphitheater like giant fingers. We
               INTERCUT Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Sybok reacting to this
               dazzling display of power.

     220   EXT. AMPHITHEATER - WIDE SHOT

               The fingers of rock form a crude cathedral.

     221   INT. AMPHITHEATER

               Within this primitive cathedral, Kirk, Spock, McCoy and
               Sybok watch as the ground in front of them melts like
               molten lava. It swirls, creating a vortex. A RUSHING
               SOUND comes from the planet's core, growing closer.
               Something of incredible power is on its way to the
               surface.

     222   ANGLE

               A shaft of energy EXPLODES out of the vortex. It
               shoots skyward like an erupting power, blinding our
               heroes with its beauty and raw power.

     223   EXT. SPACE - ANGLE - PLANET AND ENTERPRISE

               The energy shaft rises from the planet like a beacon
               light. Enterprise, just outside the shaft, is bathed
               in its reflection.

     224   INT. AMPHITHEATER

               Sybok staggers back. Like Kirk, Spock and McCoy, he
               must shield his eyes from the intensity of the energy
               shaft.

     225   ENERGY SHAFT

               It pulsates and throbs with life. A GOD-LIKE VOICE
               comes from within.

                                   VOICE
                         Brave souls. Welcome.

               Startled reactions.

                                   McCOY
                                   (hushed)
                         Is this the voice of God?

               As if responding to McCoy's question, the energy shaft
               throbs. From the swirling dust within it, a living form
               begins to take shape. The shape is powerful, beautiful,
               enticing.

               Sybok and the others watch in wonder. The wind it kicks
               up causes them to stagger back.

     226   CLOSER ANGLE - ENERGY SHAFT

               Within this maelstrom of power, the form of humanity
               begins to take shape. And it takes on many forms, each
               reminding us of the holy paintings that have depicted
               the Almighty through the ages.

                                   VOICE
                         One voice. Many faces.

     227   A SERIES OF SHOTS

               We INTERCUT between the shifting images of God and
               the reactions of the Enterprise crew. One moment the
               figure is Ra. The next, Allah. He's black. White.
               Female. Male. Andorian. Klingon. Each witness a
               flash of his own God.

     228   KIRK, SPOCK AND McCOY

               They watch the "God Show" with mounting fascination.

     229   ENERGY SHAFT

               The Being synthesizes into the Biblical Heavenly Father
               of our imagination. (Note: The Being is contained
               within the perimeters of the energy shaft, unable to
               venture out of it.)

               The Being turns his gaze on Sybok, Kirk, Spock and
               McCoy. He beams with pleasure. His eyes twinkle.

                                   BEING
                         Does this better suit your
                         expectations?

               It does indeed. No one knows what to say. Sybok is
               vindicated; he can barely contain his ecstasy.

                                   SYBOK
                         Qual se tu?

                                   BEING
                         It is I.
                                   (pause)
                         The journey you undertook to reach
                         me could not have been an easy one.

                                   SYBOK
                         It was not. The Barrier stood
                         between us - but we breached it.

                                   BEING
                         Magnificent. You are the first to
                         find me.

                                   SYBOK
                         We sought only your infinite wisdom.

                                   BEING
                         And how did you breach the Barrier?

                                   SYBOK
                         With a starship!

                                   BEING
                         This starship, could it carry my
                         wisdom beyond the Barrier?

                                   SYBOK
                         It could. Yes.

                                   BEING
                         Then I shall make use of this
                         starship.

                                   SYBOK
                                   (thrilled)
                         It will be your chariot!

               Kirk politely raises his hand.

                                   KIRK
                         Excuse me.

                                   BEING
                                   (ignoring Kirk)
                         It will carry my power to every
                         corner of creation...

                                   KIRK
                                   (insistent)
                         Excuse me.

               The Being regards Kirk like he was a pesky insect.

                                   KIRK
                                   (continuing)
                         I'd just like to ask a question.

               McCoy looks at Kirk like he just farted in church.

                                   KIRK
                                   (continuing)
                         What does God need with a starship?

               The Being returns his attention to Sybok.

                                   BEING
                         Bring the ship closer.

                                   KIRK
                         I said... what does God need with
                         a starship?

                                   McCOY
                         Jim, what are you doing?

                                   KIRK
                         I'm asking a question.

               The Being once again regards Kirk. Kirk stands his ground.

                                   BEING
                         Who is this creature?

                                   KIRK
                         Who am I? Don't you know? Aren't
                         you God?

               The smile leaves The Being's face. THUNDER RUMBLES
               faintly in the distance, underscoring his displeasure.

                                   SYBOK
                         He has his doubts...

                                   BEING
                         You doubt me?

                                   KIRK
                         I seek proof.

                                   McCOY
                         Jim, you don't ask the Almighty
                         for his I.D.

                                   BEING
                         Then here is the proof that you
                         seek.

               A bolt of energy shoots from The Being's eye and strikes
               Kirk full in the chest, knocking him to the ground.
               Spock and McCoy look on in shock as Kirk, injured, tries
               to rise.

     230   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

               The crew can't comprehend this turn of events. Korrd,
               Caithlin and Talbot look at each other in horror.

     231   BACK TO AMPHITHEATER

                                   KIRK
                                   (to Sybok)
                         Why.. is God... angry?

               Sybok is confounded. He addresses The Being.

                                   SYBOK
                         Why? Why have you done this to
                         my friend?

                                   BEING
                         He doubts me.

               Spock takes it upon himself to step forward.

                                   SPOCK
                         You have not answered his question.
                         What does God need with a starship?

               The Being's countenance turns dark. Another bolt shoots
               from his eye and heads for Spock. CRASH! Spock is
               knocked to the ground.

               The Being turns to McCoy.

                                   BEING
                         Do you doubt me?

               McCoy looks at The Being's handiwork - his injured friends.

                                   McCOY
                         I doubt any God who inflicts pain
                         for his own pleasure.

               The Being is on the verge of zapping McCoy when Sybok
               interrupts.

                                   SYBOK
                         Stop! The God of Sha Ka Ree would
                         not do this!

               By way of reply, The Being smiles a truly wicked smile
               and Sybok realizes to his horror that he's been tricked.

                                   BEING
                         Sha Ka Ree?
                              (scornful laugh)
                         A vision you created. An eternity
                         I've been imprisoned in this place!
                         The ship! I must have the ship!
                         Now give me what I want!

               Spock shouts to his brother.

                                   SPOCK
                         Sybok - this is not the God of
                         Sha Ka Ree - or any other God!

                                   SYBOK
                         I don't understand..
                                   (to The Being)
                         Reveal yourself to me!

     232   ANGLE - THE BEING

               Before our stunned eyes The Being changes into Sybok
               himself - a dark, sinister reflection of Sybok. This Evil
               Sybok laughs, enjoying the reaction.

                                   BEING
                                   (laughs)
                         What's wrong? Don't you like this
                         face? I have so many. But this
                         one suits you best.

     233   ANGLE TO INCLUDE SYBOK

               His self-realization is painful to behold.

                                   SYBOK
                         No, no, it's not possible.

                                   BEING
                         Bring me the ship or I will
                         destroy you!

                                   SYBOK
                              (realizing The Being's
                              evil intention)
                         The ship....

                                   BEING
                         Bring it closer so that I might
                         join with it. Do it, or watch
                         these puny things die horribly.

               The Being indicates Spock and McCoy.

                                   SYBOK
                         What have I done?

                              (turns to Spock;
                                   in agony)
                         Spock...

                                   SPOCK
                                   (urgently)
                         Sybok.

                                   SYBOK
                              (soul searching)
                         This is my doing. This is my
                         arrogance... my vanity...

                                   SPOCK
                         Sybok, we must find a way...

                                   SYBOK
                                   (interrupting)
                         No. You must save yourselves.
                         Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.

               Sybok raises his hand to Spock in the Vulcan gesture of
               farewell, then turns to face The Being, gathering up all
               his power. Spock starts forward but Kirk holds him back.


     234   ANGLE - THE BEING AND SPOCK

               Sybok has no fear as he confronts his evil mirror image.

                                   SYBOK
                         (continuing; to The Being)
                         I couldn't help but notice you
                         pain.

                                   BEING
                              (caught off-guard)
                         My pain?

                                   SYBOK
                         It runs deep. Share it with me.

               Sybok boldly enters the shaft and embraces his evil twin.

     235   ANGLE - ENERGY HAFT

               An amazing spectacle. As they grapple, the good and evil
               Syboks merge into one twisting, thrashing body, clearly
               at battle with itself. The good Sybok tears himself
               loose. He dominates the struggle until the evil Sybok
               manages to rip through and fight back. The two Syboks,
               good and evil, battle on... merging, tearing again.

     236   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

               Sulu and Chekov in action. Sulu uses all the tricks
               of the pilot's trade to angle the ship into the best
               possible attack position.

               Chekov punches commands into the weapons console,
               plotting the correct torpedo trajectory. It's like
               watching two master magicians play a symphony in a
               windstorm. The screens in front of them blink and
               flash with graphic displays and warnings.

                                   SULU
                         In firing position. Torpedo

                                   CHEKOV
                         But, Captain, we're firing
                         directly on your position.

     237   BACK TO PLANET

               Sybok continues to grapple with his evil twin.

     238   EXT. SPACE - ANGLE - ENTERPRIE AND ENERGY SHAFT

               A photo torpedo leaves the dish and streaks forward.

     239   ANGLE

               CAMERA CHASES the torpedo down the shaft and into the
               hole.

                         Run! Go!

     240   INT. AMPHITHEATER

               Impact is seconds away. Kirk, Spock and McCoy run for
               cover. From far beneath the surface of the planet
               comes the SOUND of the EXPLOSION. The ground blisters
               and puckers.

     241   AMPHITHEATER - LONG SHOT

               Our heroes dive for cover as a BLINDING EXPLOSION erupts
               from the hole.

     242   INT. AMPHITHEATER

               Smoke. Debris. The cathedral is in disarray. An
               eerie silence. Kirk, Spock and McCoy emerge from cover.
               The energy shaft is a memory. In its place there is
               only a gaping hole, glowing raw and red like a wound.

                                   SPOCK
                                   (softly)
                         Sybok...

               A RUMBLING SOUND from within the earth. The hole
               throbs. It pulsates.

                                   KIRK
                                   (worried)

     243   KIRK, SPOCK AND McCOY

               They haul ass up the side of the amphitheater.

     244   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

               Chekov and Sulu still at work at the console.

                         Sulu, I've lost them.

               They desperately try to locate Kirk, Spock and McCoy on
               the planet below.

     245   ANGLE - DEFENSE STATION

               The unattended screen still depicts the Bird of Prey.
               "ESTIMATED TIME OF INTERCEPT: 4 MINUTES." Then,
               the graphic of the ship vanishes and is replaced with
               this warning: "CLOAKING DEVICE ENGAGED. POSITION
               UNKNOWN."

     246   EXT. AMPHITHEATER

               Kirk, Spock and McCoy reach the top and rush to
               Copernicus.

     247   INT. COPERNICUS

               Kirk, Spock and McCoy make it inside. The door closes
               behind them.

                         Spock, get us out of here!

               Before Spock can act a tremendous blow rocks the shuttle.
               There's something out there and it wants to get in. 
               Spock tries the controls.

               Before Spock and McCoy can protest, the transporter beam
               shimmers down and takes them away.

               Spock and McCoy step off the platform. Scotty is at

               The Klingon ship has decloaked and fired from a position
               directly in front of the Enterprise. In cowboy terms, it's
               got the drop on them.

               Enterprise absorbs a terrific jolt. Spock, McCoy and

               Kirk turns to see another BLINDING EXPLOSION. He
               looks frightened; realizes he's not going to be
               beamed up.

     255   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

               The crew painfully pulls itself together. Fires are
               put out. Auxiliary power comes on. Spock, McCoy and

                         lying. Captain Kirk is on the
                         planet below.

                         Then give me his coordinates!

               Spock glimpses a possibility. He turns to Korrd and
               speaks with urgency.

                                   SPOCK
                         General, I am in need of your
                         assistance.

                                   KORRD
                                   (scoffing)
                         My assistance?

                                   SPOCK
                         You are his superior officer.

                                   KORRD
                         I am a foolish old man.

                                   SPOCK
                         Damn you, sir, you will try!

               Korrd sees that Spock will not take no for an answer.

               CUT TO :

     256   EXT. SPACE

               The Bird of Prey flies toward the Enterprise.

                                   SPOCK'S VOICE
                         Klingon Commander, someone wishes
                         to speak with you.

     257   EXT. PEAKS - PLANET

               Kirk scrambles from one hiding place to another.

     258   PINNACLE

               With nowhere to go but up, Kirk scales a steep pinnacle.
               He climbs with agility and speed.

     259   WIDE ANGLE SHOT

               Kirk climbs up as a bolt of light hits the rock before
               him. The blue light and smoke of The Being pulsates
               from the rocky face of the mountain. The eyes of The
               Being glow white.

               There's a WHOOSHING SOUND from above. Kirk looks up.

     260   ANGLE -  SKY ABOVE

               The Bird of Prey drops out of the storm clouds. Its
               guns come to life and strafe the rock creature.

     261   KIRK

               Vulnerable atop the pinnacle. The Bird of Prey hovers
               directly above him, its guns swiveling in his direction.
               Kirk is determined to go down fighting.

                                   KIRK
                              (shouting in defiance)
                         So it's me you want, you Klingon
                         bastards! What are you waiting
                         for?!

               The Bird of Prey's transporter beam shimmers down and
               engulfs him. Kirk disappears in its sparkling light,
               saved from The Being who lets out an angry roar of
               defeat. The Bird of Prey takes off with its prize.

     262   INT. BIRD OF PREY - TRANSPORTER ROOM

               Kirk materializes. He's immediately seized by two
               brutal-looking Klingons. They march him out of the
               transporter room.

     263   INT. BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE

               The bridge doors slide open and Kirk is brought in.
               The Klingon crew regard him from their stations.
               Klaa is off to one side looking petulant. Korrd stands
               beside him, chest puffed up with pride, obviously in
               charge.

                                   KORRD
                              (to the guards)
                         Release him.

               The guards step away from Kirk. Klaa glares at Korrd
               but it's clear the older Klingon is now calling the
               shots.

               Kirk regards Korrd with surprise.

                                   KORRD
                                   (continuing)
                         Kirk, my junior officer has
                         something he wants to say to you.
                              (speaks to Klaa in Klingon.)

                                   KLAA
                         I apologize.

               Korrd speaks to Klaa in Klingon once again.

                                   KLAA
                                   (continuing)
                         The attack upon your vessel was
                         not authorized by my government.

                                   KORRD
                         Kirk, and now, may I present our
                         new gunner.

               The command chair swivels around to reveal its occupant
               to be Spock. He unstraps himself from the gunner's rig,
               stands up and straightens his uniform in a dignified
               manner.

                                   KIRK
                         Spock?

                                   SPOCK
                         Welcome aboard, Captain.

               Kirk regards the stoic Spock with affection and wonder.

                                   KIRK
                              (can't believe it)
                         Spock, I thought I was going to
                         die.

                                   SPOCK
                         Not possible. You were never
                         alone.

               Kirk fights back tears and clasps his friend in a hug.
               Spock stiffens with embarrassment.

                                   SPOCK
                                   (continuing)
                         Please, Captain, not in front of
                         the Klingons.

               Kirk laughs and hugs him all the harder. Spock tentatively
               hugs him back.

               CUT TO :

     264   EXT. SPACE

               Enterprise and Bird of Prey are side by side, in orbit
               around the planet.

     265   INT. ENTERPRISE - FORWARD OBSERVATION ROOM - ANGLE ON
               KORRD

               The Klingon polishes off a tumbler of fluid. He frowns.
               What he wants is a real drink. Scotty approaches him.

                                   SCOTTY
                         Would you care for a wee nip of
                         Scotch whiskey?

                                   KORRD
                         Ummmm...

               Scotty produces a bottle and pours a splash into the
               Klingon's tumbler. Korrd downs it with obvious relish.
               Scotty smiles.

                                   SCOTTY
                         I never thought I'd ever be drinking
                         with a Klingon, heh?

               Korrd chortles agreeably and moves off. We FOLLOW him
               over to Talbot and Caithlin.

                                   KORRD
                         What are you two conspiring
                         about?

                                   TALBOT
                         We were just saying how far we've
                         come in such a short space of time.

                                   KORRD
                         We certainly have.

     266   ANGLE - SULU AND CHEKOV

               The doors slide open and Vixis, Sulu and Chekov enter
               the room, Vixis leading the way.

                                   CHEKOV
                                   (re Vixis)
                         She has wonderful muscles.

     267   ANGLE - KLAA

               Vixis walks to Klaa. When they see him, Chekov and
               Sulu suddenly stop and turn away. Klaa waves off a
               waiter who offers him a drink. He approaches a table
               where Kirk sits talking to crewmen. Klaa gives him
               the Klingon chest-thumping salute.

     268   ANGLE - KIRK

               With a smile, Kirk returns the Klingon salute.

               He notices Spock and McCoy standing at the window,
               staring out, oblivious to the party around them. Kirk
               approaches.

                                   KIRK
                         Cosmic thoughts, gentlemen?

                                   McCoy
                         We were speculating.
                                   (staring out)
                         ... is God really out there?

                                   KIRK
                         Maybe he's not out there, Bones.
                         Maybe he's right here... in the 
                         human heart
                              (noticing Spock's
                              distant expression)
                         Spock?

                                   SPOCK
                         I was thinking of Sybok. I've
                         lost a brother.

                                   KIRK
                         Yes. I lost a brother once.
                         I was lucky. I got him back.

                                   McCOY
                         I thought you said men like us 
                         don't have families.

                                   KIRK
                         I was wrong.

               CAMERA PUSHES IN on them as the three men smile their
               understanding at one another and we slowly...

               DISSOLVE TO :

     269   EXT. YOSEMITE - NIGHT

               CAMERA PULLS BACK from a roaring campfire. McCoy pours
               two cups full of bourbon and hands one to Kirk who
               sets aside his marshmallow on a stick. Kirk and McCoy
               clink cups in a silent toast and drink, distracted by
               strange PLINKING SOUNDS from close by. Spock is
               revealed, absently strumming his Vulcan lute, in search
               of a tune.

                                   KIRK
                                   (with a smile)
                         Are you just going to sit there
                         and pluck that thing? Or are
                         you going to play something?

               The plinks and plunks gradually become a tune. The
               unmistakable "Row Your Boat." Kirk and McCoy react with
               delight. Kirk takes a hit of bourbon and clears his
               throat.

                                   KIRK
                                   (singing)
                         "Row, row, row your boat, gently
                         down the stream, merrily, merrily,
                         merrily, merrily, life is but a
                         dream."
                                   (repeats)

               Spock jumps in.

                                   SPOCK
                              (singing; overlapping)
                         "Row, row, row your boat, gently
                         down the stream, merrily, merrily,
                         merrily, merrily, life is but a
                         dream."
                                   (repeats)

               Kirk sits down at the fire. He reaches over and taps
               McCoy, encouraging him to join the songfest.

                                   McCOY
                              (singing; overlapping)
                         "Row, row, row your boat, gently
                         down the stream, merrily, merrily,
                         merrily, merrily, life is but a
                         dream."
                                   (repeats)

               As they continue to sing we execute the greatest
               PULLBACK of all time. The campfire becomes a dot of
               light. The dot of light joins other dots of light.
               They become stars of the universe.

               AND THE ADVENTURE CONTINUES...

               ROLL END CREDITS OVER as the group continues to sing.

               FADE TO BLACK.
