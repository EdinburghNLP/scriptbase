</b>
    We're in a kindergarten classroom of 25 SIX YEAR OLDS. All
    sitting on the floor, legs crossed. Sitting in front of the
    kids is Little KEVIN FLEURY, flanked by his mom LYLA FLEURY
    and his dad RONALD FLEURY, in a dark suit.

    Little Kevin has a large cardboard square with pictures from
    different stages of his life taped to it. He's telling the
    class about the photos.

    We're TIGHT ON the pictures. TIGHT ON the young faces. TIGHT
    ON Fleury.

<b>                         KEVIN FLEURY
</b>              This is my Fredricksburg house and
              my grandma Ruth playing with my
              skateboard ramp. It's a Tony Hawk
              jump ramp.

    A little girl, MICK raises her hand.

<b>                        KEVIN FLEURY (CONT'D)
</b>              Mick?

    Silence from Mick

<b>                        MICK
</b>              I forgot what I was going to say.

    Kevin points to another picture.

<b>                        KEVIN FLEURY
</b>              This is me at my second birthday
              party with my mom and my dad.
              That's my cake.

    Fleury looks down sweet at his son.

<b>                        KEVIN FLEURY (CONT'D)

              and this is my dad and me and my
              grandpa Willie.

    Kevin points to another photo.

<b>                        KEVIN FLEURY (CONT'D)
</b>              And this is me and my dad and my

The kids all lean forward and squirm as they try and get
closer to the pictures. MISS ROSS, the pretty twenty five
year old teacher watches from the side.

<b>                    MICK
</b>          Where's your gun?

<b>                    LITTLE BOY
</b>          Yeah, where is your gun?

Pretty much all the kids get in on this now. Everyone wants
to see Fleury's gun. Fleury makes eyes at Miss Ross. She's
giving him a `no fucking way' hard eye.

<b>                    FLEURY
</b>          I'm assuming that there are no bad
          guys in this room. Isn't that
          right? I mean, are you guys good
          guys or bad guys?

<b>                       THE WHOLE CLASS
</b><b>          GOOD GUYS!
</b>
<b>                    FLEURY
</b>          Right. So why would I have brought
          my gun to a room full of good guys?

This silences the class. Miss Ross keeps things moving,
pointing to a photo.

<b>                    MISS ROSS
</b>          What's that picture?

<b>                    KEVIN FLEURY
</b>          This is me and my dad playing
          Battleship at my dad's apartment.

Mick's hand goes back up.

<b>                       KEVIN FLEURY (CONT'D)
</b>          Mick?

<b>                    MICK
</b>          What is a battleship?

<b>                    KEVIN FLEURY
</b>              (abruptly)
          My parents are divorced.

A beat. Lyla and Ron look down at Kevin, stalled...

<b>                        KEVIN FLEURY (CONT'D)
</b>              But that's OK `cause the most
              important thing is to know that
              everybody loves each other.

    This hits a bit hard on Lyla and Ron. Miss Ross jumps in.

<b>                        MISS ROSS
</b>              So, who's that in that picture up
              on top?

              and he's a really mean fish.

</b>              Really. His happiest day! Can you
              tell us about that day, Mr. Fleury?

    Fleury smiles, looks out at the class.

<b>                    RONALD FLEURY
</b>          I sure can. That was December 4th
          and that was the day that we spent
          the whole day in the hospital
          waiting for this guy right here to
          come out of Kevin's mom's tummy.
          And we waited and waited but he
          wouldn't come and we kept waiting
          and finally the doctor said
          `OK...he's not gonna come out on
          his own so we got to go get him.'
          And well,

Fleury stops, checks in with Miss Ross.

<b>                    RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
</b>          Can I tell this story?

<b>                       MISS ROSS
</b>          Go for it.

                    RONALD Fleury
          So they take her and put her on a
          special bed and they give her some
          medicine so she doesn't feel any
          pain then they take out this tiny
          little knife and make a tiny little
          cut right here in her tummy.

The kids are mesmerized...

<b>                    MISS ROSS
</b>          Then what happened?

                    RONALD Fleury
          Then the doctor put her hands way
          up into Kevin's mom's tummy. WAY
          IN! And then you know what they
          did?

A little girl, LU LU: WIDE EYED

<b>                    LU LU
</b>          What did they do?

<b>                    RONALD FLEURY
</b>          They started to pull and pull and
          pull... they had something in there
          and it started coming and they were
          pulling and the doctor all of the
          sudden said "STOP!"

The class is frozen. Fleury has them.

              looked up at me and said `Hey, Mr.

              world rocked?' And I just stared at
              her and she pulled this little head
              up out of that belly. And it was
              him. His head. And I looked down at
              him and screamed "Kevin!!" And he
              looked down at me and screamed
              "Daddy!!"

<b>7   EXT. AN UNKNOWN ROOFTOP - LATE DAY                             7
</b>
    A Muslim family sits together at a table under a tented-
    canopy: 32 year-old MAN nervously chewing on a toothpick, and
    his 8 and 15 year-old SONS. The 8yo leans his weight into an
    old MAN hunched and obscured by his grandson - this is his
    Grandfather. He gently rubs the Boy's head with an ancient
    left hand. The Boy finger-paints in Arabic script, right to
    left, getting paint on the table. Read the translation: There
    is no God but Allah.

    The Grandfather's face is down, obscured by his shumagh: the
    head-wrap worn by some Muslim men. Never a clear view of his
    face. His 32 year old Son and eldest Grandson sit next to
    them, the Son talking quietly on a cell phone, chewing that
    toothpick, eyes set on something in the distance: A Security
    Gate three hundred yards away, the entrance to some sort of
    compound. The Compound looks like a walled-off subdivision,
    most of which we can see from this high up.

    The landscape is foreign. Scrub desert. Ten miles beyond, on
    the horizon: the shimmer of a modern skyline. Surreal
    monolithic shapes made more so by the heat.

    Muted yells-claps-screams waft in from that Compound now...
    Catches the youngest Grandson's attention. Eyes lift up from
    his painting: the yells-claps-screams are coming from a
    softball game mostly visible behind the Compound's reinforced

     Sounds from the softball game much louder now, just over the
     walls. Security perimeters two checkpoints deep before you
     get to the main gate. A maze of concrete Jersey-barriers to
     slow all entering vehicles: give machine-gun emplacements
     flanking the entrance plenty of time to shred those vehicles
     if need be. Middle-Eastern Police platoons. 500 lbs. lift-
     gates to dissuade any vehicle that just tries to ram through.

     SERGEANT HAYTHAM: a lean, 27 year-old Middle-Eastern
     Policeman in-command of the Entrance. Sweats through his
     uniform. A late-model Range Rover with blacked-out windows
     queues up. All the windows roll down: just a single, portly
     White WOMAN behind the wheel, her INFANT CHILD in a car-seat
     in front. Two other Uniformed Officers mirror-scan the bottom
     of the Rover.

     A brief exchange, as Haytham checks his ID:

<b>                         DRIVER
</b>               How are you today, Sergeant?

<b>                         HAYTHAM
</b>               Sun is shining. Wind is blowing.
               How bad can I be doing?

<b>                         DRIVER
</b>               I like that, "Sun is shining..."

     A tight smile from Haytham.

     The other Officers are checking the inside of the Rover now.
     They nod to Haytham, Haytham hands the ID back to her.
     Windows rolls up. Lift-gate goes up. Range Rover pulls away,
     navigating the zig-zag jersey barriers.

     Stay with the Range Rover as it moves deeper into the
     complex. Think middle-class Phoenix suburb circa 1960: stucco
     homes sandwiched between dormitory style apartment blocks,
     concrete and rock where grass should be.

     The Range Rover passes a tank with a caged SOLDIER on top
     sitting behind a fifty caliber GUN. A Police Land Cruiser
     parked in the middle of the road is the last of the security.
     Official markings, emergency lights in the grill.

     The Son studies the compound through binoculars, while the
     youngest Grandson squints to study the softball game:
     Interest cut with jealousy. More muted cheers float. Behind
     and above him, his Grandfather's voice, rough as sand, to his
     32 year-old Son, in Arabic:

     Another Middle-Eastern POLICEMAN takes in the motley

     White Man cheering on his plump-pink 9 year-old Son sliding
     into third.

     Safe. Clapping and Hoots. The PITCHER: an older White Man in
     his middle forties visibly frustrated. A 25 year-old African-
     American Batter steps to the plate now. Pitcher turns to his
     Fielders:

               Ready for my knuckle-curve?

     The Batter just stays focused as the Pitcher tosses a high-
     lob. Batter smacks the ball a mile high, deep to left. The
     teammates of the plump-pink Boy on third:

     A 14 year-old Indian girl sprints underneath the fly-ball:
     sets up, catches it, juggles it, drops it.

     We pick up different families on the grass nearby: A young

     The muted reaction to the dropped ball. The whole Family,
     save the youngest Grandson, intently focused on two Officers
     walking up to that Police Land Cruiser parked in the middle
     of the road, well inside the compound: no blinks now.

     The youngest still enthralled by the softball game, the
     cheers, the running, the shorts and t-shirts. We see his
     Grandfather's left hand stop rubbing the Boy's head, and move
     to the Boy's temple, placed like a blinder so he can't see
     what's about to happen. In Arabic:

     rapid-firing 9MM pistols. The Driver and Passenger hit
     multiple times instantly, crumble lifeless in their seats
     before anyone has time to process the sounds, link them to an
     attack. The two firing `Officers' move low-fast like
     professionals: rip the fresh bodies from the Cruiser, jump
     in. The new Passenger rips an AR-15 rifle off the center
     console. The new Driver lays rubber into the Compound.

     member of the Security Details in and around the Compound go
     prairie dog: search with necks extended, eyes wide -- what
     the fuck was that? The Boy tries to turn his head away from
     the game to look for himself: Grandfather just pushes his

     Game forgotten. Parents up, screaming for loved ones, moving
     fast toward the parking lot. The Middle-Eastern Officer that
     has been watching the game hustles onto the field, next to
     the Pitcher, waves people toward him. Gathering but sporadic
     gun-fire in very near distance.

     The Officer rips a yellow gun-shape from his jacket pocket.
     The Pitcher sees it, instinctively tries to rip it away from
     him. Gets a handful of collar, pulls as violently as he can,
     shreds the front of the Officer's coat: a white linen vest
     with a bulge in-front underneath the jacket...

     Panic. The Officer swings the yellow gun-shape, what we now
     realize is an electric drill crudely modified into something
     else, bashes the Pitcher's face with it. Those that had
     gathered have turned, are sprint-stumbling away...

     The Officer closes his eyes, depresses the drill trigger,
     vanishes before we comprehend the massive release of blue-
     black chaos, expanding in an ever-wider sphere. Immediate
     surroundings dissolve: players, parents, stands, cars, the

     blown inner-ear. He also wears a jacket, and holds a modified

     The off-balance Officer stops over a 30 year-old African-

     her bare leg and open-toed sandal kick at air. The Officer's
     breathing calms: the sight of exposed skin as divine
     reassurance. CLOSE-UP: the vented rear of the drill as the
     14.4 volt motor sparks blue. A second blue-black explosion
     that shreds the parking lot as cars smash into one another
     desperate to escape.

     screech. Momentary pause after the a massive collision.

     Then Sergeant Haytham, 9MM in-hand, falls from the Second
     Land Cruiser. Stalks bloody to the Passenger side of the
     jacked Land Cruiser still slowly rolling backwards, leaking
     all it's vital fluids, it's snapped drive-shaft leaving a
     groove in the pavement. And Sergeant Haytham empties his clip
     into the interior while walking along side.

     The Officer Haytham told to 'move,' rips himself from the
     Passenger's side of their vehicle, bleeding profusely,
     screaming something unintelligible into his handheld radio.

     whitewalls, short-sleeves, khaki Dockers, a thick Casio G-

     Hangs up his phone. Lifts his eyes: Hell from one side of the

     that bathe the horror in industrial incandescent. Columns of
     black smoke. Fleets of emergency vehicles. 100 uniformed men.
     Another 200 in bio-suits combing the ball field, the parking
     lot. Fran has to do something/anything.

     Move through the horror with him now. His hands shake, his
     face already dirty with soot. Jumps in with a Saudi team
     pulling a half-burned WOMAN out of a smoldering Range Rover.
     She fights them, gouging Fran's face, trying to get back in.

     She is the woman we met at the gate of the compound.    She

     the Saudi emergency team to fight with her. Backs away until
     he feels grass under his feet. The woman's screams
     reverberate. Fran just sits in the grass. Staring at the
     woman, her shattered soul. Forces himself to look away. Eyes
     come to rest on a child's baseball cap: ragged holes ringed
     with black stains: where blood dried on the blue felt.

</b>                   (immediately behind)
               Fran. You gotta stand Big Man...

     Fran turns to find REX BURR: 5'7" fireplug. A long silence.
     Fran points to the hat:

<b>                         FRANCIS MANNER
</b>               Rex, how old were you when your hat
               was that small?

     We watch tears well in Rex's eyes...

<b>                         REX BURR
</b>               You gotta stand, Big Man.

     Fran does. Wipes his hands on his pants. Slack-jaw hopeless.
     The first moments in what will be weeks of reverse-
     engineering the murders of unknown dozens. He and Rex step to
     a group of WALKING-WOUNDED. A NEIGHBOR doles out mugs of
     coffee. Most everyone from the compound is out, pondering the
     proximity. SAUDI emergency teams sprint past. Fran spits,
     settles in:

<b>                         FRANCIS MANNER
</b>               We need to get everyone back, then
               get all their-

     SOMETHING HUGE EXPLODES over their shoulders, 50 yards away.
     The Attack's coup de grace: wait for people to lift up their
     heads, hit them again. Five times the size of the suicide
     bombs. Shreds emergency vehicles, nearby homes and apartment
     buildings. Kills Saudi rescuers by the bushel. Fran is
     crushed by a flying portable light standard. Rex is blown
     into the man handing out coffee. The walking wounded get
     decimated.

     and flame pour skyward from the site of the coup de grace
     explosion. Massive crater. Screams. Chaos postcard.

      Fleury sits with GLENDA MANNER... a toy remote-control robot
      comes into the room. Little Teddy Manner (5) peeks his head
      around the corner of a door.

<b>                          GLENDA

                guy...It wasn't. It wasn't.

      Glenda breaks down, starts to completely lose it. Her little

      Teddy up over his head. Eye to eye.

      Little Teddy shows Fleury his toy helicopter. His dad's
      soldier boots.

      Fleury can't take it.

      A PAUSE: Fleury freezes up on a shock of raw emotion,
      struggling to contain himself.

     Startling quiet in contrast. AGENTS cluster beneath 32-inch
     Televisions suspended from the ceiling. Tuned to Al-Jazeera,
     CNN, BBC, etc. Most eyes focus on the double-bloody scoops
     from CNN. Volume low:

               Arabia, in or around the `Al-

               near Riyadh. More than 100 feared
               dead, including children. The Saudi
               Foreign Minister has released a
               statement calling this a `heinous
               act possibly committed by

               several attacks on these compounds
               in the last five years. As such,
               they have become very tight in
               terms of security, with both the
               Saudi National Guard and police
               taking command.

     Fleury walks under the televisions. A folder in-hand, heading
     down a long hallway, subordinating his fury to tasks-at-hand.

     seated lecture hall-style. Steam from fifth, sixth cups of

     cribbed from Al-Jazeera.

     Throughout the scene, Fleury constantly refers to a roster of
     his ERTs.

JANET MAYES, 29 years-old, stifles a sob in the front row.
Fleury steps from behind the podium, puts a hand gently on
Janet's shoulder, leans in and whispers something no one but
Janet hears. Whatever his words, they give back her
composure. She nods.

<b>                    RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
</b>          So was Rex Burr from State.

Fleury lets the news absorb as he steps back to the podium.
No one says a thing. Fleury lifts his eyes again, real
trouble maintaining control...

<b>                    RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
</b>          Fran was the best among us...we'll
          feel this loss the rest of our

          Grant, take stabs at bomb sizes.

GRANT SYKES. 50 years-old. Virginia State Trooper before
joining the FBI. Law-and-order formidable: sharp-smart
Charlottesville accent. Studies the images for a beat...

<b>                    GRANT SYKES
</b>          From the craters, looks like they
          used a High Explosive... possibly
          military grade: can't fit that much
          TNT into a vest. 20, 30 pounds of
          PETN: they got it. Semtex or C-4:
          they could get it. The third there,
          God knows...that crater looks like
          a plane dropped a 500-pounder...

<b>                    RONALD FLEURY
</b>          Obviously a secondary blast after
          the initial devices used to lure
          first responders to the scene.
          Don't know anything about where or

<b>                    GRANT SYKES
</b>          This is how they do it.

ADAM LEAVITT. 34 years-old, sought-after Investigator.
There's a constant, intense grind to this guy, a mind and
mouth incapable of quiet. He paces around the room, then
eagle-eyes the bomb images... starts surge-scrawling crude
diagrams of the blast site on a piece of loose leaf. Feels
more like nervous doodling than work. Not looking up from his
drawing:

</b>          If you already know the answer
          Adam, why ask the question?

Fleury circles Leavitt's name on the roster. Leavitt never
stops drawing.

<b>                    SYKES
</b>          We're not seeing this kind of
          planning and execution anywhere
          else...these ain't hot-wired
          artillery shells waiting for
          Humvees to roll by.
              (pointing at the screens)
          These hits are coordinated:

          daylight balls-

               the images)
          Yeah, So... did they all happen
          during daylight?

Another great question. Fleury looks over to AGENT #1 on his
immediate right, an egg-head type with a big binder in front
of him. Everyone's eyes follow. Agent #1 flips quickly
through the binder, back-and-forth, searching. Fleury crosses
his name off of his roster. Then:

<b>                    AGENT #1
</b>          Yes. At least the first parts of
          the attacks.

Everyone smells it: that's big -- more proof these attacks
are being carried out by one, very skilled Terror Cell.

<b>                    JANET MAYES

          sophisticated. Command and control
          was flawless. They found the
          largest kill zone they could and
          they did it... they did it by being
          patient.

</b>          Any rumors or confirmations of
          uniforms being used in the other
          two attacks?

Fleury circles Mayes' name on the ERT roster.

<b>                    AGENT #1
</b>              (from memory)
          No. I know this is the first for
          that.

<b>                    GRANT SYKES
</b>          That's `worst case scenario' if
          you're still asking for my stab,
          Sir. A crew who can build bombs
          this big, with this level of eyes-
          on control and detonation
          coordination... has access to Saudi
          uniforms now...I mean...Baby Jesus.

<b>                    LEAVITT
</b>          Anyone take credit?

Fleury checks from his notes.

<b>                    FLEURY
</b>          Abu Hamza. Saudi Al-Qaeda. Bin-
          Laden-wanna-be. We know he was in
          Afghanistan, then moved to Iraq.
          Now he seems to have come home.
          He's clearly becoming increasingly
          active...

<b>                    ADAM LEAVITT

          turning up the volume over there.

      Sykes studies Leavitt with what is best described as
      substantial skepticism. Fleury circles Sykes' name on his
      roster.

<b>                          JANET MAYES
</b>                They can't afford to appear as if
                they are losing any kind of
                control. They lose control over
                their country, their people...then
                they risk losing control over the
                oil. They won't let us in. No way.

      Fleury's P.O.V.: His open folder on the podium. A memo
      printed on Department of State letterhead. Pulls the memo,
      reads it aloud, calm laced with rage.

<b>                           RONALD FLEURY

<b>32   INT. SAUDI NATIONAL GUARD PRISON - UNKNOWN TIME              32

     COLONEL AL-GHAZI, Saudi Police, 45 years-old, mustache as         
     thick as Sykes'. A firecracker-loud crack makes him flinch.
     He stands in the back of the room, not participating in the
     interrogation. Just observing. Clearly not happy about what
     he's observing.

     His POV: The Officer from the second Land Cruiser that rammed
     the fake and killed those inside, Sergeant Haytham. slab-
     cuffed and being worked over hard buy a couple of thick-
     fisted SAUDIS.. Silent tears roll off his cheek, left ear
     split ghastly. A MAN standing far right of him beats him: the
     firecracker sound again.

     Al-Ghazi looks away, biting his tongue. Obviously wants this
     over.

     In-charge of the interrogation: GENERAL ABDUL MALIK. He
     doesn't appear sadistic, but very determined to get the truth
     from Sergeant Haytham by any means necessary. Those
     distinctions blur easily. Malik gives a `hold-up' signal. The
     following exchange in Arabic:

<b>                         GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
</b>               No falsehoods, Sergeant Haytham.
               What was your involvement?

<b>                         SERGEANT HAYTHAM
</b>               Killing those I saw responsible.

<b>                         GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK

alert.

     The only sound for a long, unsettled moment: Sergeant
     Haytham's labored breathing. Malik looks at the shirts, then
     Al-Ghazi, hesitates, steps away.

     Two others in-attendance. A pear-shaped 54 year-old man with

Janet stares at Young, looking mildly in over her head.

</b>          Two suicide bombers. Rumors they
          were dressed as Saudi Police. We

          terrorist named Abu Hamza.

Young just stares at Fleury kind of odd like a kid staring at
a mushroom flavored Popsicle.

<b>                    GIDEON YOUNG

Fleury continues:

<b>                     RONALD FLEURY
</b>          A Shooter crew served as
          distraction. After the initial
          attack there was a lull to allow
          Saudi Emergency Teams...and our own
          attaches...to collect. Then a
          secondary blast was triggered,
          aimed at those first responders. So
          they targeted families and rescuers
          with one attack.
              (mildly sarcastic:)
          I think that's a clear signal that
          their definition of `Enemy' is
          expanding.

          I heard this morning's news. After
          speaking with Thamer, I advised we
          withhold additional US personnel
          because a big part of the religious
          justification for these bombs is
          the presence of current US
          personnel. More boots on Saudi soil
          make an already combustible
          situation more so. I know that's
          not the answer you want, but...

Motions to Maricella: the floor is yours.

<b>                    MARICELLA CANAVESIO
</b>          My two cents: The Saudis haven't
          asked for FBI help. Sounds like
          they've done just the opposite. If

the meeting isn't ending.

<b>                    GIDEON YOUNG
</b>          It's some variation on vengeance...

<b>                    RONALD FLEURY
</b>          To call this massacre an act of
          terrorism... that implies a
          specific political agenda. To me,
          these killings are so futile and
          unbalanced that they feel utterly
          sociopathic- more like Charles
          Manson than Osama Bin Laden...

Fleury looks to Mayes. She clears her throat. Delivers the
following with utter precision.

<b>                    JANET MAYES
</b>              (beat, fuck it: Go)
          Al Qaeda lost the first phase of
          this war, so a new, zero-sum phase
          has begun: if you won't join us,
          we'll let loose the truly talented
          Murderers... Abu Hamza. He will
          kill so many of you that the
          resulting humiliation of the Saudi
          Royal Family will cause an exodus,
          a rebellion, both. Because the
          Royal Family simply cannot protect
          you or yours any longer.

Fleury studies Janet with solid respect. He gives Janet a
subtle nod: "Nice work."

<b>                    RONALD FLEURY
</b>          When she says talented, she's not
          talking about the walking-bombs who
          can sneak past any and all
          security, nor the hi-jackers tough
          enough to take an airliner. We're

<b>                    RONALD FLEURY

          their Oil: 15 of 19 hijackers on 9-
          11 means most Americans will never
          stop asking if that Saudi Oil is
          worth it. It's all about press.

<b>                         PRINCE THAMER
</b>               I had an interesting conversation
               with a reporter from the Post.

<b>                         RONALD FLEURY
</b>               She can be a bit of an
               exaggerator... I'm sure things were
               somewhat over-stated. I see myself
               as friend of Saudi Arabia. I just
               need a little cooperation, that's

     Fleury takes a beat.

<b>                         RONALD FLEURY
</b>               This goes one of two ways. First:
               The FBI with the White House go on
               the kind of aggressive PR "Saudi
               Royal Family Decaying Monarchy"
               bender that just can't help but
               hurt. Really hurt. And I don't care
               how many Chinese are lined up to
               buy the oil. You know it's gonna
               hurt.

<b>                    RONALD FLEURY
</b>          And then we bring the hammer down
          hard as hell: Bust Al Haramain - we
          got direct links from Riyadh - two
          wives donating ten million to three
          Arab-American cultural centers in
          Boston. Then what gets kind of not-
          funny is how some of that cash
          found its way to Jakarta and some
          Mosques that have these training
          camps built right next to them.
          It's kinda funny... you got little
          kids playing over here, and some
          not so little kids playing with
          guns over here. That's kinda odd.

<b>                    PRINCE THAMER
</b>          You have no proof of this.

<b>                    RONALD FLEURY
</b>          We're getting there, Sir. And I
          haven't even brought up the two
          girls still missing out of Houston.
          This is big. It is real. And I know
          you only care so much about public
          American opinion, Sir. But the
          story will be covered... Big...

Thamer is clearly rattled. Fleury is starting to crack this
man.

          It's above the fold, just below the

<b>                    PRINCE THAMER

Fleury looks back to him.

<b>                    RONALD FLEURY

     Sergeant Haytham enters, bandaged, blank, then a small smile
     crosses his face. An old man's weathered voice, in Arabic:

<b>                         OLD VOICE (O.C.)

     Haytham's P.O.V.: His FATHER, glass-frail, lying in a bed, a
     small TV nearby, on but soundless. Haytham goes into a
     routine: rolls out two prayer mats, steps to his Father,
     reaches down to pick him up. His Father readies himself --
     stops everything when he sees the bandages up close, the
     black bruises with outer rings of purple covering 1/2 of his
     Son's cheek. Looks into his boy's eyes.

<b>                         HAYTHAM'S FATHER

     Haytham not returning the gaze, hoists his Father into his
     arms -- pain shoots up his arms from his damaged wrists.

     Haytham looks into his father's eyes now. No words. Haytham's
     eyes well with tears. After a long silence:

<b>     INTERCUT WITH THE HAYTHAM SCENE:

     Al-Ghazi sits on pillows on the living room with his WIFE and
     three DAUGHTERS. A television is on, playing "MAN SAYARBAH AL
     MILIOUN" the Arabic "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire." Al-
     Ghazi's children are playing a game with peas, trying to
     guess which one of his hands Al-Ghazi is hiding the pea. When
     a girl guesses correctly, he eats a pea.

     From outside, we hear the call to prayer. Al-Ghazi and his
     family all move to prayer mats in his living room.

     Haytham continues carrying his Father to the prayer mats.
     Gently sets him down, Kneels down himself, carefully rolls
     his Dad to his stomach. Then stands to help tuck his Father --
     in obvious, great arthritic pain -- into a kneeling prayer
     position.

     Kisses his father on the top of his head. And both pray.

     the Team outside the plane now, bags dropped at their feet.
     90 degrees even this late. Look-up: light washing over a
     small, formal Saudi military team in front of two caskets
     draped in American flags, and a small convoy of bullet-proof
     black Suburbans. Adam Leavitt will never forget this first
     glimpse of Saudi Arabia: surreal. Tears in Janet's eyes as
     she glimpses the caskets.

     Colonel Al-Ghazi steps up, offers his hand to Fleury. Fleury      
     and Al-Ghazi shake:

     Three men multi-task hustle to forklifts, start them up. Into
     the cargo hold, pulling out paletts. Things moving orderly-
     fast now. The Americans just kind of step back, dazed.

     Sergeant Haytham, driving one of the suburbans, steps forward
     with kevlar vests for our crew.

     The crew hits their bags, pulls out their vests.

     Another OFFICER checks each team member's FBI badge and
     passport. Stops at Leavitt's: an Israeli stamp on his
     passport. Leavitt's quick:

     The speedometer at 110 m.p.h. Haytham navigates with his left
     hand. Prayer beads hang from the rearview mirror. Al-Ghazi in

His left hand hand wrapped around the stock of an Mp-5
machine gun. Fleury takes in a deep breath: let's see who
this guy is.

<b>                    RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)

          you should have seen him play for

Fleury nods to Sykes, giving him the go to start in with the
Bad Cop. Throughout the following exchange, we stay TIGHT ON
FLEURY: in control, using Sykes to ask the questions he
"diplomatically" does not want to ask.

<b>                    GRANT SYKES

          Yes. But your team cannot work
          nights.

Janet looks to Leavitt, then Fleury: `what did he say?'
Fleury looks to Sykes, `Keep going...'

A truck 200 yards ahead in the middle of an abrupt U-turn.
Over the median. Dust cloud. Heading back our way. Something
big in the truck's bed. Our vehicle shimmies as Al-Ghazi
flinches, drops his prayer beads. Mp-5 up to the Colonel's         
sight-line, muzzle tracking the truck. Leavitt leans away
from his window as the vehicles pass: streetlights show two
farmers, a camel sitting in the bed. Missed their left turn.

A long, nearly comical moment.

Fleury cycling through different angles. Continues:

     Al-Ghazi stanches an explosion. Haytham looks over at his
     Colonel: rarely ever seen him like this. Looks in the rear-       
     view mirror to see Sykes, the man giving the Colonel fits.        
     Sykes catches him looking back, gives him a quick wink into
     the mirror. TIGHT ON Haytham's face: the guilty little smile
     you give when someone takes your boss to task.

               Officers total, across the country,

     Young says nothing, just pulls a memo from his bag, clears
     his throat -- still no eye-contact -- reads aloud like a poor

          admission.
              (beat)
          Simply: I've lost all confidence in
          the FBI, especially it's uppermost
          echelon. Entrenched and outmoded,
          the Leadership has shown itself
          fearful of the pioneering thought
          this Committee and I have tried to
          imbue. It is thus an Agency at
          contretemps, hindering our every
          effort.' And by `Committee' I mean
          the fucking SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
<b>          ON TERROR...

Young finally makes eye contact: expecting something like
fear, remorse, back-pedalling...

<b>                    DIRECTOR GRACE
</b>          Senators? Then I'd change
          `outmoded' to `outdated,'
          `echelons' to `ranks' and what in
          God's name is `contretemps?' These
          guys aren't the best and brightest-

<b>                    DIRECTOR GRACE
</b>          -but you can say `Fucking?'

contact manifest.

<b>                     DIRECTOR GRACE (CONT'D)

<b>                         DIRECTOR GRACE
</b>               I do.

     Young's pallor tells us his bluff has been called. Goes
     silent. Grace smells it, finishes him now:

<b>                          DIRECTOR GRACE (CONT'D)
</b>               Westmoreland made all us Officers
               write our own obituaries during
               Tet, when it looked like the Cong
               were going to end it all right
               there. Once we clued-in that life
               was finite, the loss of it no
               longer scared us: the end comes no
               matter what, it's just a question
               of how you want to go out: on your
               feet or on your knees. After that,
               we went out and pulled triggers
               until barrels melted. And Vietnam
               lasted another seven years.
                   (beat)
               The lesson extends to this career:
               I ACT, knowing the end of this job
               will come, no matter what. You
               should do the same.

     Grace waits: nothing else from Young. Stands, snaps his ID
     badge back on his lapel, walks out.

     Florescent lights make it ugly. Haytham dumps duffel-bags by
     their bunks, SANG stack steel travel-boxes from the paletts
     inside. No windows, AC cranked to `coldest.' Americans sealed-
     in - in the name of comfort.

Janet's area made obvious with a floral partition. She
immediately folds it, puts it into a corner. Haytham watches
her undo his work.

Al-Ghazi and Haytham leave. The doors close behind them, then
the sound of a key turning in a lock. The Americans look on,
half-disbelief, half-comedy: locking us in.

</b>
     Pre-dawn: Eight black suburbans parked on the side street:
     waiting. The doors of the first four open in-unison. 20 Arab,
     suited SECURITY GUARDS exit.

     Al-Ghazi unlocks the door to the compound: the team stands
     dressed, waiting. CLOSE-UP: The Team steps out to see
     massive, organized security.

     From one of the vehicles exits a middle aged AMERICAN -
     sweating a bit, hanging back, watching. This is US Deputy
     Chief of Mission, the Embassy's second-in-command: DAMON
<b>     SCHMIDT.
</b>
     Another 100 Security CONTRACTORS remain vigilant: SNIPERS on
     roof-tops, in machine-gun nests.

     Schmidt approaches Fleury.

          live through this, which I put at
          about fifty percent - if you do,
          your balls are gonna get stretched
          and beaten on. Dig that?

Fleury stares at this freak show. Schmidt sticks out a paw.

<b>                    SCHMIDT (CONT'D)
</b>          Damon Schmidt. State Department.
          I'm in charge of getting you out of

PRINCE BIN KHALED and his INNER-CIRCLE exit a Suburban and
approach: All in traditional dress. The Prince locks eyes
with Fleury.

IN THE BG, forklifts rumble-hiss to life, placing Jersey
barriers around the community center.

<b>                    SCHMIDT (CONT'D)
</b>          Don't let go of his hand first.
          Major disrespect.

One of the inner-circle, without a word, takes off the FBI-
emblazoned windbreaker worn by Leavitt and places it on a
short-sleeved Janet. Careful not to touch skin.

Only then does Prince Bin Khaled approach. A lone
PHOTOGRAPHER follows: snapping pictures. Different
definitions of personal space: four inches separation as Bin
Khaled greets each Team member in accented English. Janet
last: the pictures suddenly stop. The Prince gives a little
curtsy, no words, steps back to Fleury: the pictures re-
start. Bin Khaled holds Fleury's hand sixth-grade boyfriend-
style.

<b>                    PRINCE BIN KHALED

As the cameras start flashing. Angle on Al-Ghazi and Haytham
placed to stand next to the Americans. Haytham clearly not
comfortable with this kind of attention.

<b>                     PRINCE BIN KHALED (CONT'D)
</b>          We've invited American legal

          offering helpful hints.

          You will please honor me with your
          presence tonight at my home.
               (beat, a stunted nod)
          Yes.

The Prince turns back to the convoy. Entire entourage
follows. One of the Security Contractors catches the jacket
Janet hurls back at him, tosses it to Leavitt. Convoy gone.
The team turns: 100 glares again. Fleury blinks out the
camera flashes, takes in all the eyeballs.

Fleury looks up at a retreating Damon Schmidt.

<b>                    SCHMIDT
</b>          Nice pictures. You guys ready to go
          home now?

Dead eyes from Fleury. He's clearly not amused.

<b>                    SCHMIDT   (CONT'D)
</b>          OK. If you change   your minds, I got

He points a finger gun at Fleury.

</b>          Enough.

Haytham walks off by himself, shaking off the shady Royal
photo vibe, looking back at the Americans. From behind him:

<b>                    POLICE OFFICER
</b>          You're willing to die to protect
          your enemy?

Haytham turns. An older POLICE OFFICER stands with a GROUP of
SANG twenty feet behind him, eyeing Haytham.

Back to Fleury: he looks to Al-Ghazi.

<b>                    RONALD FLEURY
</b>          What did the Prince say?

<b>                     COLONEL AL-GHAZI

Fleury tries to remain cool.

<b>                    RONALD FLEURY
</b>          That's not accurate--

Al-Ghazi ignores Fleury.

<b>                     COLONEL AL-GHAZI                           
</b>          --I need to make sure the sites are
          secure. Then you can begin
          observing.

Leavitt looks around at the Security as Al-Ghazi hustles off:

<b>                    ADAM LEAVITT
</b>              (to Fleury)
          How could they get more secure?

The Team slowly realizes they're not going anywhere yet, dump
their bags in a pile, already disgusted.

In the distance, the group of SANG stare back at our team.

      Hold on an empty 2' X 1' X 6" balsa wood box set on a dirty
      linoleum floor.

      Ancient hands line the balsa wood box with bricks of putty-
      gray plastic explosive. We immediately notice the right hand
      is missing the index and middle fingers. The hands insert
      bright-red blasting caps into the explosives, lengths of
      detonating-wire emanating from each cap.

      Another set of stronger, younger, in-tact hands gently pours
      a mixture into the box now. Ball bearings, children's jacks,
      marbles, razor blades, roofing nails. Everything malevolent
      densities and angles. Some pieces bounce out, run along the
      floor. The younger hands then start pressing/molding the
      pieces of soon-to-be shrapnel into the putty-gray plastic
      explosives.

      Sykes and Fleury lean against the locked door, staring at the
      pathetic sight before them: Janet's truly awful jumper...
      that somehow swishes every time. Before she lands, cocky and
      smooth:

     Then the metallic swish of the all-weather net. Leavitt boxes
     out air for the non-existent rebound, grabs the ball, chest-
     passes it Great Santini-hard back to Janet who softly sucks
     in the pass. Playing in their cargo pants and hiking boots.

<b>                         LEAVITT
</b>               How do you do that?

     Janet gently bounce-passes it back:

<b>                         JANET MAYES
</b>               Check.

<b>                         LEAVITT
</b>               Don't say `good' again.

     Janet takes the check from Leavitt: before he can react, she
     drains a 30-footer. Same cockiness, different word:

<b>                         JANET
</b>               Bueno.

     Fleury with Sykes still standing in the same spot. Looks up:
     Al-Ghazi coming into the building. Fleury ready to vent until
     something surprises him: breathless, Al-Ghazi has broken a
     wide-sweat hustling back to the Americans. Fleury's face
     relaxes. He pulls a bottle of water out of a cooler, hands
     it to Al-Ghazi.

<b>                          COLONEL AL-GHAZI

          Colonel?                                              

Al-Ghazi ignores Sykes.

<b>                    FLEURY
</b>          So, if you're not running the
          investigation...who is?

Al-Ghazi motions to 50 MEN in uniforms different than his:
SANG troops digging, bagging evidence, marking the scene with
red-flags.

<b>                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI

</b>          --the bombers didn't wear a
          soldier's uniform. They wore mine.

Fleury finally speaks, asking the most important question:

<b>                    RONALD FLEURY
</b>          Who is in charge of the
          investigation then?

Al-Ghazi points to a Man we've seen before, General Abdul-

away: maps, blueprints, utility schematics spread before him.

          This is not a game show, Mr.
          Fleury! There are no deals made
          here. There is me telling you what
          you may or may not do and there is
          you doing it.

Beat. As Al-Ghazi stabilizes...

<b>                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)                    
</b>          You will be permitted to walk
          through the crime scenes. When we
          have determined that it is safe.

A stand off. Fleury eyes Al-Ghazi. Trying to figure this guy
out.

Sees something that looks like a flash of embarrassment in Al-
Ghazi's eyes: unable to perform his profession, relegated to
Tour Guide. Leavitt begins taking notes. Haytham sees his
notebook, snaps his fingers at Al-Ghazi who looks, nods: let
him.

     Fleury tight-grins. Looks off. In one of the apartments, he
     sees a PERSON looking down at them from behind a curtain.

     He tries a new tactic.

<b>                         RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
</b>               How have you guys been doing with

<b>                         AL-GHAZI
</b>               What witnesses?

     Al-Ghazi just stares at Fleury.

<b>                         FLEURY
</b>               I'm guessing there are a bunch of
               Americans, Brits... Australians?
               Someone must have seen something.
               I'm sure they're just dying to talk
               to you guys, seeing as how the
               killers were wearing your uniforms.
               That must be a real confidence
               booster for them.

     Al-Ghazi silent, staring.

<b>                         FLEURY (CONT'D)
</b>               Let me talk to them.

     Al-Ghazi looks unsure. He was not expecting this.


<b>71   EXT. RIPON FAMILY HOME                                       71

     Fleury and Al-Ghazi walk up the front walk. Fleury noticing
     kids bikes, hockey gear, a comfortable easy chair covered in
     fur outside on the front porch, toy guns.


<b>72   INT. RIPON FAMILY HOME - MOMENTS LATER                       72
</b>
     Fleury sits with the RIPONS: EARL (40s) JANINE, his wife
     (30s), and MADDY, Earl's mother (late 60s). Earl sits on an
     ugly couch, a plywood sheet right above their heads. Everyone
     uneasy save the CAT in Maddy's lap. Fleury waves off a bottle
     of water from Janine. Al-Ghazi hovers awkwardly by the front
     door.

<b>                    RONALD FLEURY
</b>          Why Saudi Arabia?

A moment as Earl and Janine get a bit defensive:

<b>                    EARL
</b>          Neither of us did anymore schooling
          than Electra High, Electra Texas.

<b>                    RONALD FLEURY
</b><b>          OK.
</b>
Al-Ghazi sees Janine smile, squeeze Earl's hand tighter.

<b>                    EARL
</b>          And the jobs here pay twice what
          you'd make in Midland or the Gulf
          a' Mexico. Plus the house is free.

Earl's mother Maddy looks at Fleury, pets the cat.

<b>                    JANINE RIPON

          wrong?

<b>                    JANINE
</b>          We didn't really see anything. Just
          hit the ground and hustled to the

</b>          So you really didn't see anything.

<b>                    MADDY

<b>                         FLEURY

               Not even the Men that did this
               should die in front a' their
               babies.

     Fleury lets moments pass. Earl rubs his wife's leg, trying to
     comfort her. Al-Ghazi hides emotion.

<b>                         RONALD FLEURY

     Fleury looks out the window towards the Jackson house.

     Next door to the Ripons. Fleury knocks. Door opens: a sad MAN
     with black bags under dying eyes. Disgusted-resigned breath
     through a half-open mouth. Silver watch and Polo insignia...
     sees Al-Ghazi, eyes come alive, teeth grit.

</b>          I'm Special Agent Ronald Fleury of

<b>                    AARON JACKSON
</b>          -the Police: they attacked.

Al-Ghazi quietly backs away, walks away. Fleury looks after
him, turns back to Mr. Jackson who stares after Al-Ghazi:
hate. Fleury unsure what to do next.

<b>                    AARON JACKSON (CONT'D)

Jackson remembers the warning he just spoke...

<b>                    RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
</b>          To ask about two nights ago.

Fresh tears re-animate his face:

<b>                    AARON JACKSON
</b>          When my wife's jaw was shot off in
          front of our sons? My sons who sat

          have the bottom of her face and I
          wasn't home and my baby boys are

     Silence outside of Mr. Jackson's sobbing. Fleury sick to his
     stomach. Desperate to let this man alone. No eye contact.

<b>                         RONALD FLEURY
</b>               ...I won't pretend to know...

     Aaron Jackson settles, wipes away tears, appreciates the
     honesty. Then bites back into his rage:

<b>                          AARON JACKSON
</b>               Kill everyone that had something to
               do with this. Everyone related to

                   (beat)
               And all you'd be doing is their
               recruiting for them... It's an
               entire generation: not small and
               isolated like they say. But a
               generation that thinks what they
               did to my wife, to my children, is

     A child's scream from inside. Piercing. Scary. Jackson goes
     red, clenched fists, steps to Fleury who takes an instinctive
     step backward, guard-up. Jackson stops, spins back inside. A
     door slam that rattles the plywood sheet covering the
     shattered window. The screams become night terror shrieks.

     The team tours the site.

     As they fan out. They walk casually, but focused through the
     first bomb site. An inquisitive Mayes, already peering into a
     mostly in-tact car, halfway out of its parking spot. Al-Ghazi
     and Haytham watch the Americans like mother-hens.

<b>                         JANET MAYES

     Fleury steps, looks inside: blood and safety glass coat the
     seat. Janet points to keys in the ignition: still at the `on'
     position. Then the stick-shift, pulled to the back right:
     reverse. The shift-knob bloody...

               the impacts -- no matter how fast
               or strong or smart you are, if

     Sykes notices something on the ground... he picks up a
     military detonator, discretely hands it over to Fleury.
     Fleury quietly pockets it.

     Al-Ghazi points to a mass of black metal: looks like a fire

     Fleury is taking in the entire crime scene. He notices a four
     story building half a mile off the perimeter.

     He watches Al-Ghazi rip at a chunk of floorboard wedged into
     the mud, bag it himself, search for someone to give it too.
     Nobody. Sets it down. Stands, wipes his hands hard on his
     pants. Fleury could swear the dirt stains are intentional:

Fleury's thinking, looking into the car. Searching the
horizon, he spots a distant apartment building providing a
view of the crime scene.

                 Somehow...took control of this
                 vehicle. I'm guessing they didn't
                 politely ask whoever was in this
                 car if they could take it for a
                 little ride?

       Fleury gets in the car, checking out ballistic shreds in the
       back of the passenger seat headrest.

</b>                 No, they didn't. There were two

locks on the OBSERVATION BUILDING in the distance.

<b>                    FLEURY
</b>          Seems reasonable that the Planner
          had to observe and based on Hamza's
          past history, it's consistent that
          he would want to video the attack.
          Is that true? Is that accurate?

Fleury points to one particular building.

     Fleury speaks slowly and clearly now: like he's cementing his
     words in his own head as he speaks them.

               the Prince the end of the chain?

     Al-Ghazi hesitates, can't help but be charmed. Fleury clearly
     knows when to step-on or lay-off the gas. He's smooth... and
     HIGHLY EFFECTIVE: Al-Ghazi nods `yes' to the strange half-

handed as Al-Ghazi tries to step past. Collective shock.

In that breath, Haytham punishes the Officer with a left-
cross: knees buckle before he comprehends what hit him.
Haytham's kick follows, catches the Officer in the sternum as
he hits ground.

Al-Ghazi shakes it out, trades blows with the SANG second in-
command.

Leavitt moves, catches a rifle butt to the shoulder after two
steps. Fleury aims, drills the Soldier that butted Leavitt:
instant night-night. Another SANG steps up. Fleury throats
him, knee caps him, and grabs his weapon before the dude hits
the ground.

Fleury can obviously fight... all the above happens in four
seconds.

Then, a `knock-it-off' gunshot aimed at the sky pops one-foot
from Janet's head. We hear what she hears: one half-second of
the shot, then the big ring. On her knees immediately, hand
over her ear. In response: heavy-caliber gunfire flies: group
flinch-n-crouch. The warning shots from a .50-caliber mounted
on a Humvee racing this way from Al-Rahmah: dust plumes from
the speed. Members of the security detail and the Special

     Al-Ghazi the first to her, touching her hand to pull it away
     from the ear. A SANG nearby sees this: spits two inches from

     That Soldier's hand goes up sheepish. Two men out of the

     cuff him, lock him in the vehicle.

shots we saw posted on Leavitt's computer: clearly a match.     
This is where they shot the video

Another long moment. Al-Ghazi looks at the table, discarded
trash: the Capri Sun containers, the candy wrappers.

<b>                     RONALD FLEURY

          everything he could hit.
              (beat)
          Way too pretty a' plan to have been
          fully hatched on just one visit. He
          came here a couple times.

Al-Ghazi quiet for a long while. Then he reciprocates:          

<b>                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
</b>          The man who did this is a Saudi -                     
          this place, this neighborhood... if                   
          foreigners were up here, someone
          would say something.

Fleury looks over to the two dozen LOCALS peering out with
suspicion at them on the rooftop.

<b>                    FLEURY
</b>          I see.

<b>                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
</b>          Nobody's talking. Here, many people                   
          love Hamza - they think of him like                   
          Bin Laden. Like your Robin Hood.                      

Fleury smiles small at whatever just passed between them. Al-
Ghazi stays stoic, then looks straight at Fleury:

Al-Ghazi pauses.

</b>            I'm sure the General is good
            guy...and I'm just as sure he's no

Al-Ghazi stands still, silent. Fleury reaches into his
pocket. Reveals the detonator to Al-Ghazi. Al-Ghazi reaches
to take it. Fleury holds it for a BEAT...

<b>                      RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)

He hands the detonator to Al-Ghazi.    Al-Ghazi now pockets it.

</b>            Miss Mayes will not attend this

Fleury looks over to Janet. Hurt, yet extremely defiant, she
looks ready to attack anything that comes near her.

     Team frustration has evolved into angry acceptance.

     The convoy zipping alongside a wall now: desert-orange in

     and local politicians (most aristocratic and exclusive) are
     permitted a brief audience with the Prince. A bizarre

      The Prince sits on a sea of pillows. There are several small
      flat screens playing business reports, CNN and Al-Jazeera.

      Seen from behind the Prince: everyone but Leavitt standing
      next to faces we've never seen. The table holds six gold
      serving platters. Enough food to kill a famine, tended by a
      frenzy of servants.

      Sykes puts a hand over his cup to stop the constant tea re-
      fill.

      Leavitt stands to the Prince's left, thick leather glove on
      his hand, a falcon perched on it. Leavitt holds it away from
      the rest of his body like he's already made peace with losing
      the arm. Servants hold three others close-by.

Pin-drop silence in response to Fleury murdering the Prince's
"lite subjects," his attempt to extend the gilded circle-jerk
by offering tours. Bin Khaled's face sinks to gray again
after the excited pink of talking about his Falcons. His hand
slowly moves back over his stomach: Napoleon's ulcers. As
Fleury speaks, people unconsciously put their tea-cups down,
look up at him with wide-eyes.

<b>                     RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)

The Prince stares at Fleury, cataloguing everything Fleury
just said. Stands. In Arabic:

<b>                    PRINCE BIN KHALED
</b>          Colonel Al-Ghazi, a word.                             

As the Prince walks out with Al-Ghazi, he signals another
corps of servants to serve another round of cups: coffee.
Dinner over. A servant takes the Falcon from Leavitt just as
he was starting to smile at it.

Fleury sips his coffee. Schmidt and Sykes approach.

<b>                    GRANT SYKES
</b>          That was impressive.

<b>                    RONALD FLEURY
</b>          Think it will work?

<b>                    GRANT SYKES
</b>          Yeah. Maybe. I mean, you can only
          play the "I'm going to the press
          card" like three more times. So,
          maybe.

<b>                    RONALD FLEURY
</b>          They're paranoid and overly self-
          protective.

<b>                    DAMON SCHMIDT
</b>          They aren't protecting anyone.
          There's no conspiracy. They're just
          terrified. Finally. The Saudis have
          finally seen the Monsters they
          helped create, because those
          Monsters have come home. And if
          Saudis don't catch Saudi Monsters,
          that's the end.

Fleury opens his mouth to interrupt.

<b>                    DAMON SCHMIDT (CONT'D)
</b>              (right through Fleury's
               attempt to speak)
          And that end could come double-
          quick if they let the US "Shaytan"
          catch those Monsters for them.
              (Fleury silent, gets it)
          Because that's what the Saudi on
          the street suspects: the only thing
          keeping the Royal Family upright is
          American evil.

     from that: stacks of bagged evidence, two dozen evidence
     containers.

     Sykes clambers out of the hole, streaks of re-animated mud
     where sweat streams out of his hairline, mad-dashing for his
     chin. A chunk of metal in one hand, something small in the

     then steps to a chunk of metal: one half of an alternator.

     Sykes stares down at the pieces of completely mangled metal.
     He studies a piece of twisted, half-melted iron. Thinking...

      hand, one of the GUARDS unloads in her direction - a full
      guttural Arabic assault. No idea what he's saying, but it's
      obvious he's furious. Haytham starts firing back. This is an
      un-translated argument. We sense that the guard is doing more
      than expressing his displeasure regarding Janet. This seems
      to be personal. Janet's getting very nervous. A frightening

A two car convoy drives deep into the city.                    

The Convoy is forced to stop across the street from a gas
station as a construction crane backs into a drive way.
Al-Ghazi and Fleury stare across the street as a large gas
truck fills up the heavy tanks of a Saudi gas station.

          here, Al-Ghazi? Penny gallon?

          named Karl Twitchell. Hired by

          didn't find so much as a dried

          oil to turn the earth.

Fleury stares out as the oil spills out overflowing from the
station tank.

      Al-Ghazi keeps moving up and into what is definitely on
      Fleury's top ten list of the most bizarre places he's ever
      been.


<b>      FLEURY'S POV:
</b>
      Two rooms: First is some kind of snack/smoke/TV lounge.
      FILIPINOS serve drinks. Packs of young Saudi MEN drink Cokes,
      tea, coffee, and smoke.

      Odd Saudi talk shows mix with hip hop.

      Behind, another room: bigger, overflowing with stacks of mis-
      matched computers. Dozens of them. Dozens of Saudi TEENAGERS
      plugged in. Head-phoned and mic'd. All chain smoking, all
      fully plugged in to CALL OF DUTY (an American war game) on
      line. These kids play with rabid intensity, smoking and

      Al-Ghazi moves through the crowd. A small middle aged SAUDI
      spots Al-Ghazi. They exchange words. Al-Ghazi waves Fleury to
      follow.

      Fleury does and follows Al-Ghazi through the computer room,
      into a back office.

      Al-Ghazi then turns to face Fleury.

      Before Al-Ghazi can answer, Talal begins talking to him in
      Arabic. Al-Ghazi translates:

          shouldn't it be 10?'

Subdued laughter. Then Talal becomes quiet, grave. Al-Ghazi
continues the translation:

<b>                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)                   
</b>          The Man who made War on Al-Rahmah
          is someone my age -- this kind of
          skill is learned over decades.

Talal looks at Fleury now, speaking directly to him through
Al-Ghazi:

<b>                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.) (CONT'D)            
</b>          A Man who can plan the mass-murder

<b>                    RONALD FLEURY
</b>              (through Al-Ghazi)
          How does he know he slept soundly?

Colonel Al-Ghazi hesitates, then relays Fleury's question.      
Talal stares: eyes touched by war-blood-atrocities committed.
Someone who believes he's going to Hell.

          17 days without sleep will make you
          quit anything.

Two TEENAGERS stick their heads into the office. They're mad
about the sharing of a computer. Talal puts a fast stop to
it. It's obvious he's good with these young boys. He smiles
as he speaks to Al-Ghazi.

Al-Ghazi translates to Fleury.

Al-Ghazi and Talal speak in Arabic about the detonator.

          Well, I think I get the `prayer'

      A five block radius has been sealed off by Police Vehicles.
      Fleury and his team are at the outer perimeter, crouched
      behind barricades at the entrance of a cul-de-sac. They're
      not allowed anywhere near the line of fire.

      They sport bullet-proof vests and helmets: look like
      reporters in a war-zone. Police turn away cars, neighbors.
      Snipers stand posted on near-by rooftops. Helicopters audible
      overhead. Street deserted.

      Two black Suburbans roll around the corner: out-fitted with
      running boards and hand rails upon which a 12-man SWAT team
      rides: 3 on each rail, 2 vehicles. SWAT team: military
      fatigues, black hoods, Mp-5 close-quarter sub-machine guns.
      Flying down the cul-de-sac: Half-way down the street, one of
      the Snipers open fire: BOOM-BOOM-BOOM. That moment an RPG
      fires wide of the lead Suburban. Over Al-Ghazi's walkie-
      talkie, in Arabic:

      The two SWAT-Teamers at the front of the running boards open
      up with their MP-5s one-handed: the front of the house puffs,
      bursts, disintegrates. Suburbans rip to a stop. SWAT off,
      move fast. Three toss flash grenades into and around the
      house. Massive flash-bangs. Six through the front door. Six
      sprinting around back. Loud AK-47 bursts from inside
      now...screams. Then an RPG fired inside: the rushing sound
      and yellow-white flash past two windows. A section of the far
      left wall of the house detonates from the inside out.

      More mechanical, silenced thwacks from the SWAT Mp-5s.
      Silence. Then voices from Al-Ghazi's walkie-talkie.
      Ambulances round the corner, fly toward the house:

      The team enters, wide-eyed. Four men in civilian garb, all
      dead: multiple bullet wounds. An Officer with four 8 X 10 mug-
      shots, matching them to the dead faces, dropping mug-shots on
      respective chests. Once he's finished, a police photographer
      takes new pictures of each. At the far side of the House:
      engineers use 2x4s to support the wall hit with the RPG. All
      of it has the feel of standard Saudi operation procedure.

      Al-Ghazi appears from the back of the house. Bends over each
      of the four dead men: lifting each of their hands, examining
      the backs of the hands quickly.

      Back to the rear of the house: stacks of plastic explosives,
      buckets of shrapnel, two Paramedics working feverishly on a
      SWAT Officer hit multiple times. Fleury goes about his
      business like a man isn't dying six feet away.

      Sykes is a kid in a candy store: rummaging through

          Good Police work and problem
          drinking are like a chicken and egg
          thing: which enables the other?

In the back, Al-Ghazi can't help a small smile either.
Fleury's not into it. All business, pissed, clearly does not
want Pabst.

</b>          Yes. Car bomb. He went back to pick
          up his deposit on the rental car.

</b>          Four hundred dollars. For four

          Stupidity. Catching the cell was
          easy. Just like this. The cell came
          back.

Fleury looks at Al-Ghazi. He knows the win is small. Also
knows that's all she wrote, for now.

<b>                    RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)

The POLICE BAND suddenly squelches loud with excited Arabic.
Everyone perks, leans up to listen to the urgency.

      back.

                What?

      Al-Ghazi and Fleury both looking back to the following
      Suburban now. Dropped back, sunglasses and blank faces
      staring back at them.

      Fleury looks to the overpass above - he sees a YOUNG MAN on a
      cell phone. As they pass, the kid runs to watch them from the
      other side.

      Al-Ghazi gets to the CB radio, in Arabic:

<b>                          COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)

      -the trailing Suburban doesn't `tighten up.' It falls further
      back. Fleury instinctively turns, wide-eyed -- out the
      window: a small brown truck swerves out of the opposing
      lanes, flying across the desert median, aimed at the Convoy.
      Without hesitation Fleury reaches over Haytham, rips the
      steering-wheel right, nosing away from the approach...

      Our Suburban on two wheels: The lead Suburban turns the same
      direction a twitch too late. The small brown truck detonates.
      The lead Suburban takes a massive fraction of the explosion
      broadside, essentially shielding our vehicle. Flame spits
      through the lead vehicle as it spins, flips onto its roof.

      The lead Suburban: tortoise on its back, engulfed, still
      sliding. Fleury's Suburban fish-tailing.

      The Lead Suburban blows in-half now as the gas tank ruptures.
      A football-sized shard of metal explodes through our
      windshield-


<b>120   INT. OUR SUBURBAN - SAME MOMENT                             120
</b>
      - and smashes straight out the back, taking the rear cargo
      door with it.

      The shock of it causes Haytham to lose control in earnest
      now. The Suburban flips, barrel rolls. Violent pounding
      inside the vehicle. Motion stops: upside down, just the roar
      of the big Detroit V-8 red-lining, wheels spinning in air.
      Everyone dazed, border-line unconscious. Fleury's bell rung
      the worst, trying to function, get his bearings.

      Fleury touches Leavitt's face, can barely see through the
      gathering smoke that smells like oil.

      the ceiling -- running FOOTFALLS approach, quick yell-yips in
      Arabic: commands?

      The Driver and three other Police Officers from the trailing
      Suburban. Smoke fills the interior now: thank God these
      Police Officers have ripped open a door: saviors. They grip
      Leavitt by his hair because it's the only thing they can
      grab.

      Alarmed, Al-Ghazi begins to scramble for Leavitt.

      Haytham gets a good look at the driver, recognizes him as the
      officer who shamed him at the compound on day one. Haytham
      moves to unbuckle.

      Fleury's trying to claw towards Leavitt. Throwing upside down
      punches at the air. Unbuckles himself now.

</b>
      Leavitt's throwing punches as he's dragged with velocity to
      the trail Suburban, idling. Pistol-whipped viciously,
      repeatedly until they're able to kick him inside. Another
      Officer from the trailing vehicle steps up with an AK-47,
      pulls back the cocking mechanism, ready to spray the dazed
      occupants of our Suburban-

      -the Officer's ankles and shins detonate. POP-POP-POP-POP
      from the driver's seat: Haytham. Screams from the would-be
      shooter at double volume. Haytham keeps firing as the
      Officer, hit multiple times, falls hard.

      The trailing Suburban hesitates,   slams into our Suburban just
      as Fleury is getting out of the    wreckage. Everybody else
      still inside, knocked silly. The   trailing Suburban backs up
      quick. Fleury instinctively goes   for his holster: empty for
      days now.

      Trailing Suburban accelerates away now, as Janet struggles
      out. Haytham's 9 MM in-hand racked open: empty. Fleury steps
      away from the now black smoke pouring from the vehicle -- in
      the passenger seat of the trail Suburban, he sees the Officer
      that checked passports at Prince Sultan Air Base.

<b>                          GRANT SYKES

      Fleury rips Grant's door open. Trapped smoke billows, clears:
      Grant's arm closest to the outside of the vehicle dangles at
      an unnatural angle, bleeding badly.

metal.

<b>                    RONALD FLEURY
</b>          Hands up -- you're gonna fall-

Sykes still does, ugly. Fleury and Janet rip him free of the
Suburban.

Haytham's pulling shotguns, handguns, ammo from the flipped
vehicle. Haytham pointing ahead, to the fading roster-tail.
In Arabic:

<b>                    SERGEANT HAYTHAM
</b>          They're going to disappear...

Desperate, Fleury looks in the direction of the fleeing
Suburban: the rooster-tail it leaves getting smaller. Al-
Ghazi nods, swings his head to thesnarled/wrecked highway
traffic. PEOPLE hesitantly step toward uniforms they trust on
instinct. Haytham dumps the pile of weapons at the Team's
feet, re-loads his 9MM. Janet ties a half-assed tourniquet
around Sykes' reminder of an arm.

Al-Ghazi steps toward the approaching crowd: they see his
state, his gun, and turn back: panic starts to infect the
larger mass, then the topper-

-AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE from somewhere. Glass-dirt-metal bursts
around us: this attack is still going.

Fleury looks up: just the roof of an old Mercedes on the
median, dirt kicked up behind them, running behind lines of
stopped-wrecked traffic now. The barrel of a rifle held high
out the window like a taunt. Accelerating for another opening
to finish the job.

Scared motorists devolve into terrified motorists. Many have
abandoned their vehicles to sprint into the desert, the rest
go smash-'em-up derby-folly: 50 panicked drivers aiming for
the same spots. Fleury snatches an M4A1 from the stack
dropped by Haytham, up to his shoulder, hustling toward the
next break in traffic. The Mercedes is approaching at 80 MPH.

<b>                    RONALD FLEURY

Al-Ghazi starts screaming in Arabic, motioning frantically to
the CITIZENS who have turned back, running toward them, in
Arabic:

<b>                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
</b><b>          DOWN!
</b>
Fleury's view blocked by fleeing Saudis: just intermittent
flashes of the Mercedes braking hard, massive dust cloud
behind them, sliding toward the opening Fleury pre-sighted.
Intermittent wild shots fired from the SUV, vaguely in our
direction.

Fleury flips a switch on the left side of the rifle, just
forward of the handle: full-auto. Takes a deep, measured
Sniper's breath, eases the stock snug aimpoint up to his
right eye, and without hesitation lets loose the entire clip
perfectly: one heartbeat before the Mercedes hits the gap.
The right side of the Mercedes shreds just as it appears.
Fleury's clip gone in a flash, yet more rounds still hit the
Mercedes: Al-Ghazi four feet away, firing his own salvo from
a knee. Something bright red pops against the driver's side
window now, the Mercedes rip-slides to a stop. Commotion
inside. Wild, half-aimed shots back at us.

Then it starts up again. Al-Ghazi bolts toward the line of
stopped traffic. Searching for something big, empty, still
running. Fleury right on his heels.

<b>                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)

Early 90's Land Rover. Desert tough. Driver long-gone,
exhaust plumes pumping out. Al-Ghazi dives into the Driver's
seat, Fleury shotgun. Guns it to the rest of the Survivors,
an eye on the rooster-tail of the Mercedes he and Fleury just
shredded, heading the same direction as Leavitt's kidnappers.

Al-Ghazi jumps out, ushers Haytham into the Driver's seat. In
Arabic:

<b>                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)                   
</b>          You know Suweidi -- you know how to
          go fast.

Fleury helps Sykes into the rear. Janet loads the weapons.
Jump in.

The Land Rover spits it's own tell-tale plume as it sprints
away down the median, dodging traffic, in desperate pursuit.

Startling silence comes sudden now as the fight moves
elsewhere. Receding engines. Petering screams/shouts.

      Back in the room, A HUGE MAN dressed in paramilitary black,
      face wrapped in his shumagh, so only the eyes are visible,
      stands in front of a sheet hung from the ceiling, quietly
      practicing/reading a speech for an imaginary audience. Lots
      of gesticulating and head movement.

      The handle of large knife sticks from his waste band.

      Door BURSTS open, bottom hinge rips from the jamb. Leavitt is
      slammed to the ground. Passport Officer shoves the practicing

      leak all at once.

      Haytham searching for the turn-off: where the rooster-tail
      they were following cut left, died. At the last minute, he
      sees tire marks headed down an embankment into a decrepit,
      decaying apartment block neighborhood. Haytham cuts hard,
      fish-tails. Sykes' head SMASHES into the rear-side window,
      starring it.

      They're being lead into Riyadh's most hostile neighborhood.

      Without hesitation Haytham pulls across the cramped street,
      surrounded by the same decaying buildings. Ahead: CIVILIANS
      huddled behind cars, poking heads out from behind shacks.

      A second passes: these people know where the attackers went.
      Al-Ghazi locks eyes with a little boy... he quickly-quietly
      just shakes his head no. In the back, Sykes has fallen on his
      back. He looks up through the window: sees a shape jet past
      on the top of the closest building -- three stories up: the
      little boy was nodding a warning-

      What follows is fast, chaotic, eyes-closed combat:

      -big BOOM of close-in shells. As Haytham throws it in reverse
      and punches, the front of the Rover shreds. The windshield
      bursts. Engine dies: tachometer and speedometer needles
      bottom out instantly. Haytham and Al-Ghazi tuck into the
      dash. Fleury tries to get as close to the backseat floor
      panels as possible. Janet covers Sykes.

      A Thump-Thump-Thump can be heard on the roof: A GRENADE
      thrown with too much arm by the guy Sykes spotted bounces off
      the roof and into the Land Cruiser.

      Frantic, Fleury swats it out.

      The blast releases a massive airburst and bits of shrapnel
      into the vehicle, starring windows, rocking it: creak of
      shocks and struts. Fleury lifts up now, grabs the M-4:
      returns fire indiscriminately through the windows at any and
      all surrounding rooftops. That provides cover and reminds
      everyone in the car they're armed. Janet exits with a rifle:

      were ready to see a massacre scurry now that it's a fight.

      A SHOOTER: black-hood, black T-shirt, old-school red-white-
      black Air Jordans, snub-stock AK, an open, filthy North Face
      backpack at his feet holding spare clips, God knows what
      else.

      Shots from below keep him two feet away from the ledge,
      firing down in random sweeps, head turned like he's lighting
      a fire-cracker.

      We see things from above, three stories down, a sweep of
      blindly-fired shells pop the asphalt inches from Fleury's
      head, soiling his face in black-top debris. But Fleury never
      stops firing back, his own head slightly turned, flinching on
      reflex. Air Jordan grabs another grenade just before he
      disintegrates: Fleury's three-feet away with the riot gun.
      Another rack and blast to make sure A.J. stays down for
      eternity.

      Fleury spots and bull-charges a second SHOOTER: Ballistic
      Chicken, Fleury wins. A sound... Fleury spins, racking the
      riot gun, aims and FREEZES: 2 six year old BOYS stare from
      the doorway.

      Haytham crouches in front of the Land Cruiser. Rocks thrown
      now from somewhere: KIDS peeking from behind shacks
      Palestinian-style. He's pelted in the side of the head.

      Janet and Sykes move to a stopped vehicle and take cover.

      From the rooftop, Fleury yells down to the men on the ground.

      Fleury's P.O.V.: an Apartment complex that looks like a
      roadside motel: exposed stairwells, walkways, entrances. A

      Then we look right, one street over: civilian FIGURES, some

      Gunshots reverberating from outside. Echoes. The 32 year-old,

      at the door: head poking out, weapon up and ready.

      We can hear Arabic yells down what sounds like a hallway.
      Passport Officer barks something back.

      The Driver of the Trail Suburban squats, pinning Leavitt's
      head down with his knee, knife near a long, white expanse of
      neck. The Huge Man sits on Leavitt's stomach, keeping him in
      place. Leavitt trying to gasp for breath: eyes-wide panic.

</b>
      Just as the 32 year-old nods yes, Leavitt explodes with his
      last bit of effort: kicks just enough to nudge the Camera,
      trying to knock it over. The 32 year-old gets his hands on it
      as it falls, almost catches it, slips out, smacks the ground,
      battery pops off. The Driver and Huge Man both begin
      hammering Adam.

      32 year-old picks the camera up again, trying to re-attach
      the battery as Adam fights for his life. Spit and claws and
      snot and blood rage.

      Running down side stairs, Fleury spots a grenade launcher
      poking from a door, next-door to the apartment with blood-
      pool in front.

      splinters. The grenade launcher recedes. Janet and Al-Ghazi
      start to run. The launcher fires from its new position...The
      trail suburban DETONATES. Al-Ghazi and Janet knocked flat on
      their asses for second and third times: dazed.

      Fleury searching: I know that Fuck with the RPG is reloading,
      how do I kill him. Drops the bag off his shoulders, pulls a
      grenade out, fires it as hard as he can: 40 yards on the fly.
      Bounces just on the third floor landing-

      Big flinch-tense on his part: rocket fires inside, roars down
      the hall, hits two feet in-front of the door Passport Officer
      has been peaking out of.

      Massive, contained detonation.   Passport Officer vanishes. The
      32 year-old and his camera are   blown through the Driver
      waiting to saw Leavitt's neck.   Because Leavitt was held so
      tight to the floor, he escapes   the worst of the blast. Still
      fucked up.

      Leavitt's P.O.V.: ears roar with the ring, no sounds. 32 year-
      old and Driver lay in a heap on the floor. Huge Man's on his
      back, trying to get up. Leavitt breathes, rolls to the Driver
      and the boy: grabs driver's blade. Hand to hand war as
      Leavitt gets his payback. He does not stop.

      Ghazi's right with him. Fleury gets three-point-stance low,
      hits the door like Jim Brown. Scattered gunfire. Fleury opens
      up in response.

      Fleury never stops forward motion. Stumbling headlong into a

      Huge Man ATTACKS Janet. Vicious hand to hand blows. Still
      tied, Leavitt does what he can, kicking at the attacker.
      Adrenaline morphs Janet from scared and out-sized to
      desperate and equally vicious. This is SAVING PRIVATE RYAN
      shit with Leavitt as the observer. He's no coward - he's
      doing everything he can.

      Huge Man overtakes Janet, slow-choking her... she's gasping,
      dying... Janet has a knife out and is shredding the big man's   
      back right thigh and ass. BOTH SCREAMING. From nowhere,         
      Fleury ends the fight with a butt-end baseball-swing of the

      As Janet's eyes catch on something: a sheet/half-assed
      backdrop hung from the ceiling has been nearly pulled down -
      exposing a crude square cut out of the wall - a path into
      another Apartment.

      Janet points to the hole in the wall. This isn't over: a
      seven-year old GIRL peers out at her, shaking, tears in her

      The little girl backs away. Janet gets up, steers Leavitt
      outside. Sits him down. Hands him a Glock.

      Fleury and Al-Ghazi step through the hole. Janet follows. A
      blood trail snakes through Little One's room, out her door,
      and deeper into another apartment. Little girl long gone into
      the main part of the Apartment. Then, Arabic SCREAMS, the

      Hustle cautious into the apartment. Haytham stands in the
      room already: the muzzle of his AK still smoking, held on a
      man down. The other occupants of the room are a cowering
      FAMILY: KIDS and a couple of real OLD FOLKS, all terrified. A
      little boy cries by himself, huddled in a corner. The
      collateral damage of random violence. Janet quick scans the

      not dead: ragged gasps. Fleury and Al-Ghazi lock eyes, then

      her hand out: I can help you little one.

her in Arabic, sharp. Janet just strokes the back of her
little bloody fist. Her little hand opens, shaking: this is a

Janet's face ghost white: Little One is trying to give her a

Al-Ghazi steps closer, sees the marble. Processes things.
Immediately looks over at the huddled mass: THE GRANDFATHER

      round into the chamber.

      Then... Fleury finally pulls his trigger.

      Utter Distortion as the old man reaches for the teenager's
      fallen hand gun. Janet, screaming, raises her gun towards the
      old man as Al-Ghazi shoots the old man in the chest. Sobbing,
      the little boy runs to his fallen grandfather. Janet, still
      screaming, covers the family. The Grandfather whispers
      something we cannot hear in the Little Boy's ear.                

      TIGHT ON HAYTHAM taking it all in: the bleeding, dying           
      teenager; his hysterical sister; Hamza choking, clutching for    
      his grandson. CHAOS, CONFUSION, CONFLICT swirling in             
      Haytham's eyes.                                                  

      A platoon of SAUDI POLICE slowly enter the room.

      Janet goes to the shot 15 year old, starts trying to stop the
      bleeding...

      Fleury reaching for the dying Al-Ghazi, cradling him. Tears
      spill as his eyes move from the dying boy to the old man,
      back down to Al-Ghazi.

      Fleury grasps Al-Ghazi's hand, as a Saudi man would.

      Fleury, Sykes, Leavitt and Janet sit around Janet's cubicle.      
      Bandages, awkward silences, and 1000-yard stares. Subpoenas       
      stacked on the corner of Janet's desk. Leavitt quiet,             
      obviously fucked up.
