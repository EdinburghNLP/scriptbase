               FADE IN:

               THE HIGHWAY - DAY

               Georgia. Two-lane blacktop, stretching from here to heaven. 
               Empty. Silent. Then, suddenly in the far distance, several 
               dark specks rise over a hill and head straight toward camera.

               Camera holds and the specks begin to take form. Vehicles. 
               Trucks. Six monstrous eighteen-wheel diesels, coming at us, 
               their smokestacks blasting. Sound grows louder, as we begin 
               to hear snatches of Citizens Band Radio talk over:

                                     VOICE ONE
                         -- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...

                                     VOICE TWO
                         -- Yeah, Breaker go head on.

                                     VOICE ONE
                         -- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a 
                         Smokey report?

                                     VOICE TWO
                         -- Road looks clean as a hound's 
                         tooth.

                                     VOICE ONE
                         -- Okey, doke. Last one to the Roadeo 
                         is a homo.

               Voices fade and titles and credits begin. "Black Smoke Blowing 
               Over Eighteen Wheels" by Red Simpson comes up in the b.g. as 
               the six trucks blast right over camera.

               AN AERIAL VIEW

               of the trucks driving through an entrance gate to a huge 
               parking lot. Over the gate is a sign reading: "GEORGIA TRUCK 
               ROADEO STATE FINALS." Music and credits continue.

               TRUCK ROADEO - PARKING LOT - DAY

               Macks, Kenworths, Whites and Jimmys, all polished to a 
               mirrored finish. Truck drivers decked out in their flashiest 
               western outfits. The stands filled with spectators on the 
               edge of their seats, watching the gearjammers put their rigs 
               through tests of skill and reflexes -- parallel parking, 
               driving around eggs, through complicated barricades, etc.

               CAMERA PICKS UP

               a customized white Cadillac convertible pulling into the 
               Roadeo grounds. The Caddy has mounted chrome quarter horses 
               on each front fender, bull horns on the front bumper, stacked 
               rifles displayed in the rear. Garish. The car's Texas license 
               plate reads "Mr. Big."

               CLOSER ANGLE

               The Cadillac stops. Two men climb out and wend their way 
               through the trucks and spectators. Camera tracks behind them. 
               Although we can't see their faces, we see that one man is 
               pudgy and decked out in a fancy white western suit and hat. 
               The other is younger, tall, skinny and wearing a grey western 
               suit and hat. Kyle Brand and his son Dickey.

               MUSIC AND CREDITS FADE 

               ANGLE - ROADEO INFIELD

               The crowd roars, as the trucks race through an obstacle 
               course.

               ANGLE - THE MEN - TRACKING

               Camera still on their backs.

                                     DICKEY
                              (referring to race)
                         Is that Bandit in the lead?

                                     KYLE
                         If that sumbitch was in the race, 
                         he'd be in the winner's circle by 
                         now.

                                     DICKEY
                         I still think this whole idea is 
                         dumb, pop.

                                     KYLE
                         Then it must be a helluva idea.

               Kyle laughs. His laugh then turns into a hacking cough.

                                     DICKEY
                         Why don't we just rent a Lear jet 
                         and haul it back ourselves?

                                     KYLE
                         Because I wanna see this hot shot 
                         Bandit do something that can't be 
                         done. Besides, there's nothing I 
                         like better than breaking legends.

               He laughs, coughs again, continues walking.

                                     DICKEY
                              (not getting it)
                         But if it can't be done, how's he 
                         gonna do it?

                                     KYLE
                         That's the point, Dickey.

                                     DICKEY
                         Oh.

                                     KYLE
                         Now, you just find him, son.

                                     DICKEY
                         Yes, sir.

               Dickey crosses to a trucker couple, polishing up their chromed 
               rig.

                                     DICKEY
                         Say, hoss. Where might I locate the 
                         Bandit?

                                     HUSBAND
                         Ain't seen him.

                                     WIFE
                              (immediately)
                         Over there behind his rig.

               The Husband shoots his old lady a jealous look. Dickey rejoins 
               Kyle and they head toward Bandit LaRue's truck.

               NEW ANGLE - MOVING

               as they come to the only battered, beaten-up eighteen-wheeler 
               at the entire Truck Roadeo. It looks like it hasn't been 
               washed since it left the showroom.

               On one side of the truck is a faded and peeling mural of a 
               stagecoach being held up. A teamster and a shotgun guard 
               have their hands high in the air and a Bandit on horseback 
               has a six-gun pointed at them.

               An elaborate CB radio antenna grows out of the cab beside 
               the driver's door.

               ANGLE - KYLE AND DICKEY - FROM BEHIND

               as they round the truck and stop in their tracks.

               REVERSE ANGLE - WHAT THEY SEE

               A hammock is stretched from the cab of the truck to an oak 
               tree. A man wearing a faded denim western shirt, open with 
               the sleeves rolled up, levis and silver-toed cowboy boots is 
               lying in the hammock. A cowboy hat covers his face.

               CLOSER ANGLE

               as shadows fall across the figure. The man slowly tips back 
               his hat and we see he's in his thirties, boyishly handsome, 
               with a cocky smile. Bandit LaRue.

               FULL SHOT

               And for the first time we get a look at Kyle and Dickey. 
               Kyle is wearing sunglasses and diamond rings on every finger. 
               His smile is as tasteless as the suit he wears.

               Dickey is in his early twenties. Blonde, blue-eyed and scared 
               to death of his old man.

               Bandit looks at them for a moment, then casually pulls the 
               hat back over his face.

                                     KYLE
                         Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit?

                                     BANDIT
                              (hat over his face)
                         Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.

               There's a long pause interrupted by Kyle's hacking cough.

                                     KYLE
                              (to Dickey)
                         What's he get if he wins here?

                                     BANDIT
                              (hat over his face)
                         If...?

                                     DICKEY
                         Five thou.

                                     KYLE
                         Chickenshit money.

               Kyle coughs again.

                                     BANDIT
                              (hat over his face)
                         Could you turn your head?

               Bandit gets up and begins untying the hammock from the tree. 
               Kyle crosses to him.

                                     BANDIT
                         Look, Kyle; I ain't in this Truck 
                         Roadeo for the money. It's the 
                         challenge. You know, the ecstasy of 
                         victory, the agony of defeat.

               Kyle looks out at the cheering crowd.

                                     KYLE
                         I can't believe there's two thousand 
                         people here to watch a bunch of guys 
                         back up their trucks.

                                     BANDIT
                         America's bored.
                              (then)
                         Now, what do you want?

                                     KYLE
                         You to forget this dumbass Roadeo 
                         and take on a real challenge.

               As Bandit turns to him, we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BANDIT'S TRUCK - DAY

               Bandit, wearing aviator shades and his cowboy hat, is backing 
               the truck up and shouting down to Kyle and Dickey on the 
               ground.

                                     BANDIT
                         You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, 
                         but crazy.

                                     KYLE
                         What's the matter? Legend has it 
                         Bandit LaRue's king of the road.

                                     BANDIT
                         I can make it to Texarkana and back 
                         in twenty-eight hours... that's no 
                         sweat.

                                     DICKEY
                         It ain't ever been done before, hot 
                         shit.

                                     BANDIT
                              (smiles at Dickey, 
                              then)
                         See, running Coors Beer east of Texas 
                         is what bothers me. It makes me a 
                         bootlegger.

                                     KYLE
                         I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled 
                         sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia.

                                     BANDIT
                         You know how rumors start.

                                     DICKEY
                         I think you're just yellow.

                                     BANDIT
                         Wonderful psychology. Why don't you 
                         say something about my mom?
                              (then)
                         Excuse me.

               Bandit drives toward the starting line for another event. 
               Kyle and Dickey run alongside.

                                     KYLE
                              (coughs, then)
                         Look, you make this little run for 
                         me, I'll buy you a new rig.

                                     BANDIT
                              (indicating truck)
                         Last year, this was a new rig.

                                     KYLE
                         But it wasn't a Kenworth.

               Dickey turns to his father, stunned, as Bandit stops the 
               truck.

                                     DICKEY
                              (sotto)
                         Pop, a K-Whopper's worth seventy 
                         thou.

                                     BANDIT
                              (correcting)
                         Seventy-two five.
                              (then)
                         Why do you want this barley pop so 
                         bad?

                                     DICKEY
                         He's thirsty.

               Bandit smiles at Dickey again.

                                     KYLE
                         I got a boy running in the Peach 
                         Tree Classic tomorrow and when he 
                         wins, I wanna celebrate in style.

                                     BANDIT
                         How much style?

                                     KYLE
                         Four hundred cases worth.

                         You paying for the gas?

               Kyle smiles that unwinning smile and takes out a huge wad of 
               bills, as we:

               GEORGIA COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

               Picturesque. Bandit's eighteen-wheeler rolling down the 
               Georgia highway, past lush green meadows and endless acres 
               of pines.

               Over this:

                                     A WOMAN'S VOICE
                         Whaddya mean, we're not going to the 
                         show tonight?

               INSIDE THE TRUCK (DIALOGUE OVERLAPS)

               And for the first time, we get a real look inside the rig. 
               It's quite a set-up. The opposite of the outside. Home on 
               the road.

               Sheepskin over the two front seats, a poster of Raquel Welch 
               in a bikini tacked above the windshield, under which is a 
               bumper sticker reading: "Do It For Truckers." On the dash 
               board, a St. Christopher medal and a chattering skull. Also, 
               a stereo tape deck and the best Citizens Band Radio outfit 
               money can buy.

               Bandit is on the C.B.

               Bandit looks at the mike and we:

               RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

               Bandit's truck pulls to a stop in front of a small white 
               clapboard house.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A FEW MINUTES LATER - INSIDE THE HOUSE

               Most of the furniture is old and what isn't, is covered with 
               plastic. No fancy carpets or objects d'art. On the coffee 
               table is an open, colorfully illustrated Bible. A blonde 
               wood television set sits in a corner of the room. There are 
               a lot of toy trucks lying around and over the mantel is an 
               oil painting of a fancy eighteen-wheeler with an epitaph 
               under it reading: "I'd rather be a truck driver, than be a 
               millionaire..."

               Bandit is trying to get into the bedroom, but his path is 
               being blocked by a faded Georgia beauty lost somewhere in 
               her thirties. Waynette Snow.

                                     BANDIT
                              (trying to get past 
                              her)
                         Goddamn, Waynette; you sure do look 
                         foxy today. If you weren't already 
                         married, I'd...

                                     WAYNETTE
                         Don't give me that horseshit, Bandit. 
                         You ain't seeing him.

                                     BANDIT
                              (determined)
                         Yes, I am.

                                     WAYNETTE
                              (equally determined)
                         No, you ain't.

               A scrawny little Kid runs through the room, followed by an 
               even scrawnier mutt.

                                     SCRAWNY KID
                         Hi, Uncle Bandit.

                                     WAYNETTE
                              (turning to Kid)
                         He ain't your damn uncle and get 
                         that mutt outta here. He just peed 
                         all over my hot curlers!

               Bandit takes the moment to slide past Waynette and duck into 
               the bedroom.

               THE BEDROOM

               is dark. The venetian blinds are drawn. Bandit hurries into 
               the room with Waynette still hollering in the b.g.

               He passes a French Provincial dresser with a small fleet of 
               model trucks on top and crosses to a Lump sleeping face down 
               on a double bed.

                                     BANDIT
                              (shaking the Lump)
                         Cledus.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (not moving)
                         No.

                                     BANDIT
                              (shaking him again)
                         Wake up, man; I just got us a hot 
                         run for big bucks.

               Bandit goes to the closet and begins tossing clothes onto 
               the bed.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (slowly rolling over)
                         Whadda we have to do -- kidnap the 
                         Pope?

                                     BANDIT (O.S.)
                              (from closet)
                         How'd you know?

               He comes out of the closet with the rest of the clothes and 
               tosses them on the bed, then crosses to the dresser drawer 
               and throws a pair of socks and underwear at Cledus.

                                     BANDIT
                         Look, all we gotta do is make a run 
                         to Texarkana...
                              (under his breath)
                         ...in twenty-eight hours.

               Cledus Snow slowly comes up from under the covers and we get 
               our first glimpse of him. He's thirty-three, but you'd never 
               take him for a day under forty. Trucker all the way. He's 
               wearing boxer shorts and an undershirt. As he reaches across 
               to the nightstand and puts on a pair of glasses:

                                     CLEDUS
                         Twenty-eight hours! You're outta 
                         your gord.

                                     BANDIT
                         Is that any way to talk to your ole 
                         partner?
                              (pulling back blanket)
                         Look, it's only nine hundred miles 
                         each way.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (figuring quick)
                         That means we gotta average ninety-
                         four miles per.
                              (lying back down)
                         Forget it.

                                     BANDIT
                         No one's ever done it before. This'll 
                         put us on the map.

                                     CLEDUS
                         Or in the slammer.

                                     BANDIT
                         Did I tell you they're gonna give us 
                         a brand new Kenworth?

                                     CLEDUS
                              (sitting up)
                         Waynette!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OUTSIDE CLEDUS' HOUSE - DAY

               Bandit sits inside the cab of the truck, nervously tapping 
               his foot and watching Cledus' kids play football on the front 
               lawn. The mutt keeps getting in their way.

               Bandit hits the horn and an instant later, Cledus steps onto 
               the front porch, followed by Waynette. He's wearing a plaid 
               shirt, levis, a large engraved cowboy belt and a thermal 
               vest.

                                     WAYNETTE
                              (handing him a thermos)
                         This ain't fair. You're letting him 
                         talk you into this.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (buttoning shirt)
                         I swear to God, pumpkin; I'll be 
                         back before you know it.
                              (sly smile)
                         And then I'll make you glad you was 
                         born a woman.

                                     WAYNETTE
                         Well, I just might not be waiting 
                         this time.

               Bandit toots again. Waynette gives him "the finger."

                                     CLEDUS
                         Honey, please... Don't be this way. 
                         You know I'd do anything for you.

                                     WAYNETTE
                         Anything?

               Cledus nods.

                                     WAYNETTE
                         Take Fred.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               GEORGIA HIGHWAY - LATE AFTERNOON

               The eighteen-wheeler heading west, stacks open.

               Over:

                                     CLEDUS (V.O.)
                         Believe me, man; Fred'll be no 
                         problem.

                                     BANDIT (V.O.)
                         Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a 
                         major asset.

               INSIDE THE CAB (DIALOGUE OVERLAPS)

               Fred, the mutt, lays with his head slumped over Bandit's 
               leg. Cledus is at the wheel, wearing clip-on sunglasses.

                                     BANDIT
                         All right, Fred; enough fun.

               Bandit picks Fred up and dumps him onto the sleeper 
               compartment behind the seats. Then, starts going over a road 
               map.

                                     CLEDUS
                         You know of course, we ain't ever 
                         gonna make it.

                                     BANDIT
                              (not looking up)
                         Quit being so negative, guy; 'course 
                         we're gonna make it. We ain't never 
                         not made it, have we?

                                     CLEDUS
                         No.

                                     BANDIT
                         See.

                                     CLEDUS
                         Our asses gonna be in a sling if we 
                         get caught.

                                     BANDIT
                              (looking up, straight 
                              to him)
                         And if we don't, they're gonna be 
                         riding high in a brand new Kenworth.

               As "Truck Driving Man" by Red Steagall starts over, Cledus 
               looks at Bandit, sighs -- then punches it.

               roaring down the highway. Music continues, as slowly day 
               becomes night and the truck whizzes across the Alabama and 
               Mississippi State Lines.

                                                          DISSOLVE THRU TO:

               THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               The rig is parked on the shoulder under a highway light. 
               Bandit and Cledus stand by the side of the truck, as Fred 
               wanders aimlessly around the grassy knoll off the shoulder.

                                     BANDIT
                              (snapping his fingers 
                              impatiently)
                         How long's this gonna take?

                                     CLEDUS
                         I don't know, man. Ask him?

                                     BANDIT
                              (nervously)
                         We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; 
                         this is costing us time.

                                     CLEDUS
                         If you ask me, I think we should 
                         make that run to Choo Choo Town and 
                         pick up that load of lumber. Nice. 
                         Easy. And within the law.

                                     BANDIT
                         Also boring.

                                     CLEDUS
                         But I still don't think...

               Bandit walks away from Cledus in mid-sentence, heading for 
               the rear of the truck.

                                     CLEDUS
                         What are you doin' now?

                                     BANDIT
                              (starting to open 
                              rear doors)
                         Running blocker.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BACK DOORS OF THE TRUCK

               As Bandit swings them open, Cledus adjusts one of two ramps 
               that have now been mounted on the rear of the truck's floor. 
               As Cledus kicks the ramp into place, Bandit climbs into the 
               back of the trailer and disappears.

               After a moment, there is a deafening roar and suddenly, two 
               headlights are GLARING straight at camera.

               NEW ANGLE

               A beat and slowly, a full-blown SHELBY COBRA II appears from 
               inside the truck. As it moves slowly down the ramp, we see 
               it has twelve coats of black lacquer, red pinstriping, 
               aluminum mags, twelve-inch Firestones, the works. A mean 
               machine.

               On the rear bumper is a CB antenna matching the one on the 
               truck.

               CAMERA FOLLOWS

               as Bandit guides the Cobra down the ramp. Cledus quickly 
               folds up the ramp and dumps it back into the truck. He slams 
               the metal doors closed and crosses to the Cobra.

                                     CLEDUS
                         All right, here's our plan of 
                         communication, so as to avoid Smokey.

                                     BANDIT
                         Go.

                                     CLEDUS
                         Now, if I say go to channel three, 
                         it really means go to six.

                                     BANDIT
                              (nods)
                         Six. Got it.

                                     CLEDUS
                         If I say go to twenty-one, go to 
                         nineteen.

                                     BANDIT
                              (trying to remember)
                         Twenty-one is nineteen.

                                     CLEDUS
                         If I say go to two, it's really one.

                                     BANDIT
                              (now totally confused)
                         Two is one.
                              (then)
                         Listen, let's just stay on the odd 
                         channels and switch everytime. Start 
                         in the basement. Now, let's haul 
                         ass.

               Cledus grabs Fred, who's still peeing and bounds up the metal 
               steps of the cab. As Bandit lays twenty feet of rubber, we:

               MISSISSIPPI HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               The Cobra followed by the Eighteen-wheeler whip past camera. 
               (NOTE: From this point on, the Cobra will be referred to as 
               Bandit I. The Eighteen-wheeler as Bandit II.)

               INSIDE BANDIT I (THE COBRA)

               The car is cherry. Wooden steering wheel, all leather 
               upholstery stereo tape deck, harness-style seat belts and a 
               CB radio identical to the one in Bandit II.

               Bandit is talking to Cledus on the CB.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         Bandit One, am I hitting you?

               INTERCUT - BANDIT II (THE EIGHTEEN-WHEELER)

               Cledus picks up his mike. Fred is now riding shotgun.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (into mike)
                         You're wall to wall and tree top 
                         tall.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead 
                         of you. Keep both feet on the floor. 
                         We'll be moving ninety and over.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (into mike; after a 
                              beat)
                         Bandit?

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         Yeah?

                                     CLEDUS
                              (into mike)
                         Why are we doing this?

                                     BANDIT
                              (a beat, then into 
                              mike)
                         Because they said it couldn't be 
                         done.

               And:

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               Bandit I and II screaming through the Mississippi night. 
               Over this a driving Doug Kershaw fiddle.

               INSIDE BANDIT

               Bandit driving, sipping coffee from a thermos. Sees something.

               HIS VIEW - UP AHEAD

               A Mississippi Highway Patrol Car is approaching from the 
               opposite direction.

               BACK TO BANDIT

               as he eases up on the pedal and fires up his CB mike.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         Bandit Two, do you read me?

               Bandit glances up in his rear view mirror.

               ANGLE - THROUGH REAR VIEW MIRROR

               The Mississippi HPC, zips past Bandit and moves on down the 
               highway.

               INTERCUT - BANDIT I AND II (DIALOGUE OVERLAPS)

               Cledus picks up his mike.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (into mike)
                         Loud and clear.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming 
                         at you.

               Cledus immediately backs off the accelerator and slows down, 
               an instant before the Mississippi HPC passes by. Everything 
               is cool.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (into mike)
                         He's history.

                              (into mike)
                         Okay, we got a straight shot to T 
                         Town, so let her roll.

               And we:

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               SERIES OF SHOTS

               As night slowly begins fading back into day, Bandit I and 
               Bandit II blast across the Arkansas State Line.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE SUN RISING

               behind a sign that reads: Welcome to Texarkana, Texas. A 
               beat and two blurs whip past camera. Bandit I and II.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WAREHOUSE - DAWN

               Bandit I followed by Bandit II pull into the loading area of 
               a large warehouse.

               The place is locked up and the loading dock is empty. Bandit 
               and Cledus park their vehicles and climb out.

                                     BANDIT
                         Shit! No one's here.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (checking watch)
                         That's 'cause we're damn near an 
                         hour ahead of schedule.

                                     BANDIT
                         Let's keep it that way.

               Bandit grabs a crowbar from Bandit I and we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE THE WAREHOUSE

               Pitch black. A beat, then a loud smash o.s. and the door 
               slides open, sending a stream of light across the warehouse 
               floor.

               Bandit and Cledus step inside. Bandit crosses to the light 
               switch and hits it. Suddenly the entire room is bathed in 
               flourescent. We see the warehouse is filled with cases upon 
               cases of Coors Beer.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (whistles low)
                         Liquid gold.

                                     BANDIT
                              (nods)
                         Redneck heaven.

               They cross back to the large sliding door and as Bandit pushes 
               it open, Cledus jumps into the truck's cab and begins backing 
               the big rig up to the loading dock.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WAREHOUSE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

               The rig's doors are open and ready for loading. Cledus and 
               Bandit cross to a brand new fork-lift.

                                     CLEDUS
                         You know how to drive one of these 
                         things?

                                     BANDIT
                         Can a pig whistle?

               Bandit climbs into the seat of the fork-lift and turns the 
               key. The engine roars to life. He grins and confidently throws 
               it into gear. The fork-lift leaps backward and begins speeding 
               wildly around the warehouse.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (yelling)
                         Hit the brakes!

                                     BANDIT
                         They're jammed!

               RUNNING ANGLE - FOLLOWING THE FORK-LIFT

               as it smashes into stacks of Coors cases, sending them flying 
               in every direction and tossing Bandit out of the seat -- and 
               into the air.

               NEW ANGLE

               as Bandit crashes to the ground, surrounded by cases of beer. 
               He looks up to Cledus.

                                     BANDIT
                         So much for whistling pigs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE THE WAREHOUSE - TWENTY MINUTES LATER

               Bandit II is now almost filled with cases of Coors, as Cledus 
               guides the fork-lift's final load onto the loading dock. He 
               and Bandit unload the final cases and Cledus parks the fork-
               lift.

               They look around. The place is a wreck.

                                     BANDIT
                         Let's get the hell outta here.

                                     CLEDUS
                         Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?

                                     BANDIT

                         Right. Give me your pen. We'll tell 
                         'em to bill Kyle.

               As Bandit pulls out a piece of paper and Cledus hands him a 
               pen, we:

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE TEXARKANA CITY LIMITS SIGN - MORNING

               as again, two blurs flash past camera, moving south. Bandit 
               I and Bandit II -- heading home.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               ARKANSAS HIGHWAY - HIGH SHOT

               It's now mid-morning, as Camera follows Bandit I and II 
               rolling through hog country.

               OVER:

                              (into mike)
                         I hate to say I told you so.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (into mike)
                         Save it. We got a long haul.

                              (into mike)
                         Clear and rolling.

               He hangs up the mike, then sees something ahead of him he 
               can't believe.

               WHAT HE SEES

               Standing in the middle of the highway is a GIRL in a wedding 
               gown. Off to the side, on the shoulder, is a customized Camaro 
               with a "Just Married" sign on the back and strings of tin 
               cans, shoes and streamers. The hood of the Camaro is up.

               BACK TO SCENE

               as Bandit eases off the accelerator and starts to move around 
               the Girl.

               But the Girl moves with him, waving and blocking his path. 
               Bandit's forced to pull off the road and stop. The Girl rushes 
               up to the Cobra and opens the door.

                                     GIRL
                              (climbing in)
                         Thanks.

                                     BANDIT
                              (it was nothing)
                         Hey...

               The Girl slams the door and turns to Bandit. She's tall and 
               sophisticated. A hyper New Yorker in her late twenties. KATE 
               McCONNELL.

               FULL SHOT

               as Bandit I pulls away in a cloud of dust and squealing tires, 
               a beat-up VAN passes, going the other way.

               THREE SHITKICKER KIDS are riding in the Van. They watch Bandit 
               leaving the abandoned "Just Married" car and brake to turn 
               around. Bandit and Kate don't notice.

                              (after a beat)
                         Who's the unlucky guy?

               Kate takes off her veil and shakes down her hair. She's a 
               beauty. Bandit immediately notices, but keeps driving. She 
               starts talking a mile-a-minute.

                                     KATE
                         Okay. I was in Texas dancing in an 
                         industrial show for Sunkist Oranges. 
                         They say I'm the new Anita Bryant. 
                         But I'm really a dancer from New 
                         York. A lot of credits. Moderate 
                         talent.
                              (rolling on)
                         Anyway, after opening night, I was 
                         walking back to the motor lodge and 
                         suddenly there he was. A tall Texan 
                         with a twenty-nine inch waist. Pure 
                         dynamite.

                                     BANDIT
                         All sound reasons for matrimony.

                                     KATE
                         Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old 
                         hoofer who spends most of her time 
                         with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. 
                         It runs in the family. We're all 
                         crazy. Mind if I smoke?
                              (lights a cigarette)
                         Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But 
                         as I was walking down the aisle, I 
                         realized this is total insanity. 
                         What am I going to do in Texas the 
                         rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry 
                         Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna 
                         have to talk. So, halfway down the 
                         aisle, I turned and split. You think 
                         I'm nuts, right?

                                     BANDIT
                         Absolutely not. In fact, I picked up 
                         a bride yesterday; except she was a 
                         singer.

               Suddenly, Cledus interrupts over the CB.

                                     CLEDUS
                         Bandit I, do you copy?

                                     BANDIT
                              (picking up mike)
                         This is Bandit I, come back.

               Bandit turns to the Girl.

                         Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well-
                         dressed. I'm giving her a lift to 
                         the next waterhole.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (into mike)
                         Listen, pardner; this ain't no time 
                         to be getting laid.

                              (into mike)
                         Believe me, that won't be a problem.

               BANDIT II

               Cledus replaces the CB mike and slips Red Simpson's 
               "Motivatin' Man" into the tape deck.

                                     CLEDUS
                         Never fails. Bandit gets a chick. I 
                         get...

               He looks over at Fred, who's now passed out in the passenger 
               seat.

               SHINY STRIP OF CHROME

               as a pair of plyers rip it off the side of a car and we EASE 
               BACK to see:

               KATE'S ABANDONED CAMARO

               still parked along the Arkansas Highway -- now almost 
               completely stripped by the THREE KIDS in the Van. The car is 
               up on jacks, as one of the Kids, rolls the last of the four 
               tires to the rear of the Van. Another kid dumps the chrome 
               stripping into the cab, while the third, unscrews the radio.

               NEW ANGLE

               As a TEXAS SHERIFF'S CAR skids to a stop behind them. SHERIFF 
               BUELL CLAYTON climbs out. Fifty. Ruggedly handsome. An 
               imposing figure.

                                     CLAYTON
                         Hey!

               The Kids freeze, as the Sheriff strides up to them.

                                     FIRST KID
                              (pleading)
                         I swear to God, officer; the car 
                         was. already like this, we were just 
                         trying to...

               But Sheriff Clayton doesn't even notice they've stripped 
               down the entire car. He's got other problems.

                                     CLAYTON
                         Did you see the gal who was driving? 
                         She was wearing a wedding dress.

               They all nod, still shaking in their jeans.

                                     SECOND KID
                              (eagerly)
                         Yes, sir. She got into a cherry-
                         looking Cobra.

                                     CLAYTON
                         You get a look at the driver?

                                     FIRST KID
                         No, but he had Georgia plates. BAN-
                         ONE.

               Clayton turns on his heels and leaps back into the Sheriff's 
               car, muttering to himself. He jams it into gear and peels 
               out in a cloud of dust.

               The kids exchange bewildered looks, then immediately go back 
               to stripping the Camaro.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         about besides ditching Smokey?

                                     BANDIT
                         Having fun.

                                     KATE
                         Is this fun?

                                     BANDIT
                         Driving?

                                     KATE
                         Driving, talking to me...

                                     BANDIT
                         They're both a challenge.

                                     KATE
                         You have a great profile.

                                     BANDIT
                         Yeah, I do. Especially from that 
                         angle.

               She laughs. Then:

                                     KATE
                         Where you from?

                                     BANDIT
                         Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down 
                         south to work in the Civil Rights 
                         movement.

                                     KATE
                         Seriously?!?

                                     BANDIT
                              (obviously lying)
                         Would I lie to you?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               AN ARKANSAS HIGHWAY PATROL CAR

               parked off to the side of the highway behind an abandoned 
               and boarded up diner. The Patrol Car is empty and from a 
               little transistor radio hanging on the rear view mirror, 
               Merle Haggard sings, "I Take A Lot Of Pride In What I Am."

               Camera moves off the Patrol Car and finds it's Driver, an 
               Arkansas Highway Patrolman with crew cut, taking a leak.

               Suddenly, Bandit I whips past doing at least a hundred and 
               almost blowing the OFFICER over. He quickly zips up and races 
               to his car.

               BACK TO BANDIT I - MOVING

               Kate has seen the Cop. Bandit hasn't.

                                     KATE
                         Guess what?

                                     BANDIT
                         I give up.

                                     KATE
                         You just passed your nemesis.

               He looks at her.

                                     KATE
                         Smokey.

               Bandit glances up in his rear view mirror.

               WHAT HE SEES - THROUGH REAR VIEW MIRROR

               the Arkansas Highway Patrol car coming after him, it's 
               advertising twirling and siren wailing.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Bandit turns to Kate.

                                     BANDIT
                         Better fasten your seat belt.

               Bandit slams on his brakes, locking all four tires and sending 
               the Cobra into a four wheel drift.

                                     KATE
                              (as they're sliding)
                         Good idea.

               She buckles up, as Bandit grabs for the CB mike.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         Bandit Two. I'm gonna leave you for 
                         a minute. Back in a flash.

               INTERCUT - BANDIT II

               Cledus on the CB mike.

                                     CLEDUS

                         Keep 'er between the ditches.

               ARKANSAS HIGHWAY - DAY

               Bandit I slides broadside down the highway and exits down a 
               dirt road.

               DIRT ROAD - DAY

               Bandit I roars down the road, leaving clouds of dust in its 
               wake.

               HIGHWAY - DAY

               The Arkansas Highway Patrol car does a 180 in the middle of 
               the highway and takes the dirt road turnoff.

               DIRT ROAD - DAY

               Bandit I blasts up the dirt road, leaving trails of billowing 
               dust behind him. The Arkansas Highway Patrol Car in hot 
               pursuit. Over this:

                                     KATE (V.O.)
                         What the hell's going on?

                                     BANDIT (V.O.)
                         I forget to tell you. I'm running 
                         blocker for four hundred cases of 
                         illegal brew.

               A beat, then:

                                     KATE (V.O.)
                         And I thought I had problems.

               INSIDE THE HIGHWAY PATROL CAR - MOVING

               The windshield of the car is covered with dust. The Officer 
               tries to squint through it, but the dust keeps building up. 
               Finally, he turns on his windshield wipers, making the dust 
               twice as thick. And now he can't see anything.

               INSIDE BANDIT I - MOVING

               Bandit looks over his shoulder. Nothing but a solid wall of 
               dust. He whips the Cobra around a hairpin turn and floors 
               it.

               NEW ANGLE

               The Highway Patrol Car misses the turn and goes off the road. 
               Out of control, the car smashes through a clapboard fence 
               and sails into:

               A SWAMP

               It lands with a gigantic splash and water fills the FRAME.

               INSIDE BANDIT I

               roaring down the dirt road. Kate is turned around in her 
               seat, looking through the rear window.

                                     BANDIT
                         Anything?

                                     KATE
                              (turning back around)
                         We're cool. The dumb schmuck took 
                         the wrong turn.

               They both breathe a sigh of relief.

                                     KATE
                         Can I ask you something?

                                     BANDIT
                         Shoot.

                                     KATE
                         What do you want to be when you grow 
                         up?

               Before he can answer:

                                     CLEDUS (V.O.)
                              (from CB)
                         Bandit I. Bandit I. Do you read me?

               As Bandit reaches for the mike to answer Cledus, he glances 
               up.

               WHAT HE SEES

               A TRACTOR has moved from behind a tree and is crossing the 
               road directly in front of Bandit I.

               Bandit tosses the CB mike to Kate with one hand and swerves 
               the wheel to the right with the other.

                                     BANDIT
                              (to Kate)
                         Say this is Bandit I. Then, over.

               As Bandit blasts around the Tractor and down the road, Kate 
               talks into the mike.

                                     KATE
                              (into mike)
                         This is Bandit I. Over.

                         Smokey was on our tail. We had to 
                         take a detour to ditch the motherfu...

                                     BANDIT
                              (cutting her off)
                         You can't swear on these.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (from CB)
                         What's going on, Bandit? Come on.

                                     BANDIT
                              (to Kate)
                         Tell him we'll be back on the highway 
                         in a second.

               As Kate starts talking, Fred spots some cows grazing and 
               starts barking like crazy. Cledus can't hear a thing.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (to the dog)
                         Shut up, Fred.

                                     KATE
                              (to Bandit)
                         Who's Fred?

               INSIDE CLAYTON'S CAR - DAY - MOVING

               Sheriff Clayton's been listening to this whole exchange on 
               his CB.

                                     KATE (V.O.)
                         Bandit II. We'll be back on the 
                         highway in a second. Over.

                                     CLEDUS (V.O.)
                         I'll keep my eyeballs peeled.

               They glance at each other for a moment, then both look away. 
               Back at each other. Then away again. And we:

               Bandit flicks his CB selector to the next odd channel.

                         I would say your future's looking 
                         dim, boss.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike, nervous)
                         What's your twenty and what's your 
                         handle?

                                     VOICE
                              (from CB)
                         My handle's Smokey Bear and I got 
                         you by the tail.

               A SIREN BLASTS behind them, whipping Bandit and Kate around.

               THEIR VIEW - THRU REAR WINDOW

               Sheriff Clayton is right on their ass -- no more than three 
               feet away -- his siren wailing and his advertising flashing.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Bandit slams down the CB mike.

                                     BANDIT
                              (to Kate)
                         That's a Texas cop. What the hell's 
                         he doing in Arkansas?

                                     KATE
                              (uneasy)
                         I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent 
                         the heat after us.

                                     BANDIT
                              (worried)
                         A Texas Bear in Arkansas.
                              (then)
                         Something's up and at this point in 
                         my life, I don't want to know what 
                         it is.

               He trounces on it and the Shelby Cobra II springs to life, 
               laying twenty feet of third gear rubber. Suddenly, the Texas 
               Sheriff's car looks like it's standing on jacks.

               INSIDE SHERIFF'S CAR

               as Sheriff Clayton floorboards it and takes off after Bandit 
               I.

                                     CLAYTON
                              (to himself)
                         I'm gonna get that bastard. No one 
                         makes Buell Clayton look like a fool. 
                         Let's get going.

               ARKANSAS HIGHWAY - DAY

               as Bandit I races past camera. A beat and here comes the 
               Texas Sheriff. Hard and fast.

               INSIDE BANDIT I - MOVING

               Bandit is all concentration. Both hands on the wheel. Pressing 
               120 MPH. Kate fumbles for her cigarettes, but they all go 
               flying out of the pack. One lands on her lap. She lights it.

               BANDIT'S VIEW

               up ahead, the big rear end of Bandit II.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Bandit fires up his CB and flips to the next odd channel.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         I'm whipping around you, Bandit II. 
                         Smokey on the rubber.

               INSIDE BANDIT II - MOVING

               Cledus looks up ahead.

               HIS VIEW

               Traffic. Coming head on.

               BACK TO CLEDUS

               keying the mike.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (into mike)
                         You're gonna have to create your own 
                         lane, buddy. You got oncoming.

               INSIDE BANDIT

               Bandit turns to Kate. She shrugs and closes her eyes. He 
               floors it.

                                     KATE
                              (a mile-a-minute)
                         You know, my mother was a dancer, 
                         too. Her big shot was the touring 
                         company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been 
                         married three times. To a redneck, a 
                         poet and her tennis instructor.
                              (not missing a beat)
                         See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. 
                         I was nervous when I first got into 
                         the car. Now I'm scared shitless.

                                     BANDIT
                         Believe me, there's nothing to be 
                         afraid of.

               With that, Bandit flies off the highway, onto the shoulder. 
               Kate closes her eyes even tighter.

               FULL SHOT

               as Bandit pulls alongside the big eighteen-wheeler, hanging 
               onto the shoulder for his life.

               HIS VIEW

               up ahead -- a dirt road crossing. He'll never make it past 
               the huge eighteen-wheeler in time.

               NEW ANGLE

               as Bandit I hits the dirt road crossing, flies into the air, 
               comes down, smashes into a highway sign and sends it 
               splintering twenty feet into the air. Before he can whip the 
               wheel around, Bandit is staring at an endless row of rural 
               mailboxes. Kate turns her head, as Bandit I mows down the 
               mailboxes. Whap! Whap! Whap! Whap! Whap!

               Bandit drops the Cobra into first, zooms past Bandit II and 
               sails back onto the highway.

                                     BANDIT
                         Still with me?

               Kate slowly opens her eyes. She's alive.

               ANGLE - SHERIFF CLAYTON'S CAR

               trapped behind the huge eighteen-wheeler. Clayton pulls out 
               in an attempt to squeeze between Bandit II and the oncoming 
               traffic.

               Brakes squeal, as SEVEN CARS are forced to hit the side 
               shoulder. Just as Clayton moves halfway past the eighteen-
               wheeler, Cledus puts on the press -- edging Sheriff Clayton 
               over.

               Clayton's rear fender catches on the rig and rips off with a 
               terrifying SCREECH. As his fender bounces down the highway, 
               Clayton pulls in front of Bandit II a split-second before an 
               oncoming BUS almost creams him.

               INSIDE BANDIT II

               Cledus sees the passing car is Texas heat and immediately 
               flips over to the next odd channel and keys up his CB.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (into mike)
                         Bandit I, do I have copy?

               INTERCUT - BANDIT I AND II

               Bandit's pushing the red line on his speedometer and gestures 
               for Kate to pick up the CB mike.

                                     KATE
                              (into mike)
                         Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?

                                     CLEDUS
                              (into mike)
                         That's a Texas bubble gum machine on 
                         your back porch.

                                     KATE
                              (has no idea what he 
                              just said)
                         What's he...

               Bandit grabs the mike.

                                     BANDIT
                              (driving and talking)
                         Uh, Cledus; I noticed.

               He starts to hang it up.

                                     CLEDUS (V.O.)
                              (from CB)
                         What's a Texas Smokey doing in 
                         Arkansas, man?

                                     BANDIT
                              (yelling into mike)
                         If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College 
                         Bowl.

               Bandit slams down the mike and the accelerator.

               HIGHWAY - DAY

               and the chase is on. High speed. Way over a hundred. Two 
               blurs through the Arkansas countryside.

               INSIDE CLAYTON'S CAR

               Sheriff Clayton is on his police radio.

                                     CLAYTON
                              (into mike)
                         This is Sheriff Clayton. In pursuit 
                         of a black Shelby Cobra, Georgia 
                         license Boy-Adam-Nora. Ocean-Nora-
                         Eddie. Request assistance.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TWO ARKANSAS SHERIFF'S CARS

               blasting off down the highway in response. Lights twirling. 
               Sirens wailing.

               INSIDE THE LEAD CAR - MOVING

               SHERIFF WILLY BRANFORD is riding shotgun. He's fat and 
               arrogant. He chews bubble gum as he talks on the radio mike.

               A DEPUTY is driving. He's twenty-five, wears long sideburns 
               and mirrored sunglasses.

                                     BRANFORD
                              (into mike)
                         This is Sheriff Branford of Crossett 
                         County. We're already on this joker's 
                         case.
                              (he pops a bubble)
                         I got two units intercepting him at 
                         Hamburg crossing. You say you was a 
                         Sheriff?

               INTERCUT - SHERIFFS CLAYTON AND BRANFORD

               Clayton has trouble steering and talking.

                                     CLAYTON
                              (into mike)
                         That's a big ten-four. Sheriff Buell 
                         Clayton. Texas.

                                     BRANFORD
                              (stunned, into mike)
                         Texas? What the hell you doing in my 
                         goddam county?!?

               At that instant, Clayton hits a rut in the road and drops 
               his mike. He bends to pick it up and the car slides off the 
               shoulder.

               Before he can regain control, Clayton's headed straight for:

               AN ABANDONED FRUIT AND VEGETABLE STAND

               Clayton's car crashes through the stand -- flattening it.

               RUNNING ANGLE

               He blasts out on the other side, now sporting one busted 
               headlight and a dented grill. Somehow he manages to make it 
               back to the road, losing a hubcap on the way.

                                     BRANFORD
                              (over CB)
                         I said...

                                     CLAYTON
                              (picking up mike off 
                              floor)
                         I heard what you said. And I said...

                                     BRANFORD
                              (cutting him cold)
                         I don't care what you said. You're 
                         from Texas and what you said don't 
                         mean jack diddly here in Arkansas!

               Clayton slams down the mike.

               ARKANSAS HIGHWAY - DAY - HIGH SHOT

               Bandit I whips around a treacherous bend in the highway, 
               leaving Sheriff Clayton in the distance.

               INSIDE SHERIFF BRANFORD'S CAR

               The Arkansas Sheriff is mad. He spits his gum out the window -- 
               but it's closed. The gum falls back in his lap. He looks at 
               it, then pops it back in his mouth again and turns to his 
               Deputy.

                                     BRANFORD
                         What the hell you looking at?

               Before the Deputy can answer, Clayton's voice is back.

                                     CLAYTON (V.O.)
                              (radio)
                         This is Sheriff Clayton again. I 
                         lost the Cobra, but he's deadheaded 
                         toward you doing damn near 140. If I 
                         was you I'd set up a roadblock.

                                     BRANFORD
                              (grabbing mike)
                         -- And if I was you, I wouldn't be 
                         telling me what to do! Now take a 
                         hike, buster!!!
                              (he angrily hangs up 
                              the mike and turns 
                              to his Deputy)
                         Block the road.

               HIGHWAY - DAY - HIGH SHOT

               The two Arkansas Sheriff's cars slow down and form a 
               roadblock.

               Branford and his Deputy climb out of the car. Branford spits 
               out his gum, as two other DEPUTIES climb out of the second 
               car. The four officers move behind their cars. To wait.

               A SPEEDOMETER

               The needle pressing 120. Ease back and we're:

               INSIDE BANDIT I - MOVING

               as Bandit turns to Kate, who's looking out the rear window.

                                     BANDIT
                         Well?

                                     KATE
                         We lost him.

               Bandit sighs relief, then:

                                     A VOICE
                              (from CB)
                         Bandit do you read me?

                                     BANDIT
                              (picking up mike)
                         This is Bandit, you're coming in 
                         long and strong.

                                     VOICE
                              (from CB)
                         My handle's Silver Tongued Devil and 
                         I'm here to tell you, your fellow 
                         CB'ers are mighty proud of y'all.

                                     BANDIT
                         Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil.

                                     SILVER TONGUED DEVIL
                              (from CB)
                         But I got a bad Bear story.

               Bandit and Kate look at each other.

                                     SILVER TONGUED DEVIL
                         I just rolled past a county mounty 
                         roadblock down on eighty-two.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         Thanks Silver Tongued Devil, we'll 
                         avoid.

                                     SILVER TONGUED DEVIL
                              (from CB)
                         Keep the wheels spinning and the 
                         beavers grinning.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         Adios.

               He hangs up the mike.

                                     KATE
                              (referring to Silver 
                              Tongued Devil)
                         Classy guy.

               Bandit grins and takes a curve at 90. Then they both look 
               up.

               WHAT THEY SEE

               The roadblock. No way around it.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Bandit looks ahead down both sides of the highway. Thinks 
               quick.

               HIGHWAY - DAY - HIGH SHOT

               as Bandit I comes roaring down the highway headed directly 
               for the roadblock. A farmhouse is off to the side, about a 
               hundred yards before the roadblock.

               NEW ANGLE

               Bandit I swerves off the highway, throwing itself into a 
               broadside. The car lurches onto the Farmhouse driveway and 
               barrels across the front yard. It snaps a clothesline full 
               of clothes, sending bras, panties, shirts and socks flying 
               in every direction.

               It then crashes through a chicken yard and corral fence, 
               sending whatever animals are available -- flying toward 
               freedom.

               RACING ANGLE

               as Bandit I roars across a fruit orchard, weaving in and 
               around rows and rows of trees, finally slamming onto an access 
               road and back onto the highway -- way ahead of the roadblock!

               BRANFORD AND HIS MEN

               stand there like statues with their mouths hanging open. A 
               beat, then all four cops race toward their cars, leap in and 
               take off.

               INSIDE BANDIT I - MOVING

               a rattled Kate turns to Bandit. She's about to speak, but 
               sees his intense concentration and says nothing.

               THEIR VIEW - THE HIGHWAY

               up ahead. Coming straight at them, down the center of the 
               road -- another Arkansas Sheriff's car.

                                     BANDIT
                         Christ, it looks like a Smokey 
                         convention.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Bandit whips the wheel to the right and again, the Cobra is 
               airborne -- flying off the highway, careening down the 
               shoulder, through a creek and up onto another dirt road.

               THE SHERIFF'S CAR

               spins around in the middle of the highway -- almost flipping 
               over in the process -- straightens out and takes off over 
               the shoulder after Bandit I.

               CAMERA PANS

               back to the highway. As Sheriff Branford's two Patrol cars 
               come blasting down the highway. They stop at the shoulder. A 
               beat. Then they take off over the shoulder in pursuit.

               CAMERA PANS

               back again. As Sheriff Clayton's Texas Highway Patrol car 
               skids to a stop.

               INSIDE CLAYTON'S CAR

               Clayton surveys the situation. Bandit I roaring along the 
               dirt road -- the three Arkansas Sheriff cars on his tail. He 
               makes a decision.

                                     CLAYTON
                              (muttering to himself)
                         We'll meet again, Bandit.

               And he floors it taking off down the highway.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE DIRT ROAD - MOVING - HIGH SHOT

               as the three Arkansas Sheriff's cars race after Bandit I. 
               They're on a treacherously narrow road. On both sides -- a 
               long sheer drop -- to water.

               INSIDE SHERIFF BRANFORD'S CAR

               His Deputy is doing at least 80, as he pulls within a few 
               feet of the lead car. The Deputy angrily honks his horn.

                                     DEPUTY
                         I'm gonna pass this fruit!

                                     BRANFORD
                         Just back off the hammer, boy.

                                     DEPUTY
                         But sir, he's gonna get away.

                                     BRANFORD
                         He ain't gonna get nothin' but a 
                         brief mention in the obituary column.

               The Deputy turns to him, not understanding.

                                     BRANFORD
                              (with a smile)
                         The bridge up ahead is out.

               HIGH SHOT - THE NARROW DIRT ROAD

               The four cars kicking up dust for miles.

               CREEK - DAY - FULL SHOT

               where the dirt road ends. But the bridge that once crossed 
               the banks -- is gone.

               A beat and Bandit I comes roaring straight toward the creek.

               INSIDE BANDIT I

               Bandit and Kate see the creek. No bridge. End of the road.

               Bandit barely has time to hit the brakes, sending the Cobra 
               into a wild fishtail. Kate desperately braces herself, hanging 
               onto the dashboard.

               FULL SHOT

               as Bandit wheels the Cobra a full 360° and comes to a halt. 
               He looks back.

               HIS VIEW - DOWN THE ROAD

               a half mile back, the Arkansas Sheriff's are coming on fast. 
               Sirens blasting. The choices are simple. Give up. Or jump 
               the creek.

                                     BANDIT
                              (turning to Kate)
                         Listen, we can either give up or...

               Kate holds the dashboard tighter and closes her eyes.

                                     KATE
                         Just do it.

               THE CREEK - DAY

               Bandit slams the Cobra into first and takes off. Gears grind. 
               Tires screech.

               INSIDE BANDIT I

               The speedometer whizzes past eighty. Bandit holds the wheel 
               tight. Kate takes a breath, then crosses herself.

               RACING ANGLE

               as Bandit I blasts toward the embankment, hits the dirt 
               incline and suddenly is airborne.

               FULL SHOT - THE CREEK

               Bandit I in mid-air.

               NEW ANGLE

               as Bandit I sails over camera and comes crashing down on the 
               other side. They made it!

               INSIDE BANDIT I

               as Bandit and Kate catch their breath.

                                     BANDIT
                         Your honeymoon would've never been 
                         this exciting.

                                     KATE
                         I don't know. We were planning on 
                         seeing the Astrodome.

               Bandit grins and as they take off:

               CAMERA PANS BACK

               to the creek. As the first Sheriff's car comes roaring toward 
               the edge doing at least 95. He sees the bridge is out, hits 
               his brakes, goes broadside and flies over the side -- into 
               the creek.

               A beat and Sheriff Branford's car comes wailing down the 
               road. The Deputy slams down his brakes in the nick of time 
               and the car skids halfway over the edge -- hanging suspended 
               in mid-air halfway over the creek.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               as the Third Sheriff's car comes barrelling down the road, 
               spots Branford's car hanging over the edge and brakes. But 
               its rear end slings around, smashing into the rear of 
               Branford's car, sending it flying into the creek. A huge 
               splash, then:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE BANDIT I - MOVING

               as they roar off the dirt road, back onto the highway, Bandit 
               reaches for the CB mike.

                                     BANDIT
                              (to himself)
                         Christ, what channel are we on?...

                                     KATE
                         Eleven.

               Bandit looks at Kate as she reaches under the seat for one 
               of her errant cigarettes. Then, he punches in eleven.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         Bandit II. Bandit II. Give me a shout.

               INTERCUT - BANDIT I AND II

               Cledus grabs the mike quickly. Fred has been gnawing on the 
               corner of the front seat.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (into mike)
                         I hope that's you, buddy; 'cause I'd 
                         hate to start believing in ghosts.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         What does the old Timex say?

                                     CLEDUS
                              (into mike)
                         She's losing minutes so you better 
                         start running interference or we're 
                         never gonna make it. Might I remind 
                         you this was your brainstorm.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         I'll drop off my fare, hit a quick 
                         choke-and-puke and be blocking for 
                         you pronto.

               Kate tries not to react to this.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (into mike)
                         Bandit?

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         Yeah, guy?

                                     CLEDUS
                              (into mike)
                         Pick up a burger for Fred. He's going 
                         crazy.
                              (slaps Fred on the 
                              butt)

               Bandit puts the mike back and turns to Kate. Feels he should 
               say something. Before he can:

                                     KATE
                         You heard the man. Step on it.

               Bandit studies her for a moment, then stomps on it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A TRUCK STOP CAFE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

               Bandit I pulls in between a row of eighteen-wheelers parked 
               in front of the cafe. A few Truckers, bragging about their 
               rigs, check out Bandit and Kate. They're especially taken 
               with Kate's wedding gown. She and Bandit are oblivious to 
               them.

                                     BANDIT
                              (turns to Kate)
                         The bus'll pick you up over there.
                              (a beat)
                         Uh... you got enough bread for a 
                         ticket?

                                     KATE
                         Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk 
                         the rest of the way. I've been sitting 
                         a long time.
                              (a beat)
                         Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.

                                     BANDIT
                              (it was nothing)
                         Hey...

                                     KATE
                         Enjoy your Kenworth.

               She offers her hand and they shake. Then, Bandit heads toward 
               the truck stop and Kate to the bus stop. He turns and looks 
               back. She doesn't.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE THE TRUCK STOP

               about fifteen Truckers inside. Buck Owens playing on the 
               juke box. Pinball machines going strong.

               Bandit walks in and crosses to the counter. A hot-looking 
               WAITRESS with ratted hair and painted face stands in front 
               of a blackboard where the menu of the day is written. She 
               straightens herself and crosses to Bandit.

                                     WAITRESS
                              (coming on)
                         What's your pleasure?

                                     BANDIT
                              (quickly)
                         Couple of cheeseburgers, no 
                         condiments...

                                     WAITRESS
                         No what?

                                     BANDIT
                         Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; 
                         one while I'm waiting.

               Bandit crosses to a booth, as a couple of TRUCKERS enter and 
               join another TRUCKER sitting in the booth next to Bandit.

                                     TRUCKER #1
                         Jesus, Richmond; you look like 
                         squirrel shit.

                                     TRUCKER #2
                         You wanna drive fourteen hundred 
                         miles for these cheap bastards? I 
                         feel like leaving my rig in the middle 
                         of the highway and tellin' them to 
                         kiss my antenna.

                                     TRUCKER #1
                         I know what you mean, good buddy.

               The Waitress comes over with Bandit's coffee. He pours in a 
               ton of sugar and stirs. As he takes a sip, he hears:

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Hi.

               Bandit whips around.

               WHAT HE SEES

               Kate. Standing in front of him -- sans wedding dress. She's 
               now wearing tight jeans and a denim shirt with the bottom 
               rolled up and knotted above her midriff. She looks foxier 
               than ever.

                                     KATE
                              (with a southern drawl)
                         The bus ain't passin' through these 
                         here parts for a piece.
                              (sliding into booth)
                         I know. You only have a second.

               CLOSER ANGLE

               as they sit across from each other.

                                     KATE
                         They wouldn't take Master Charge so 
                         I traded in my gown.

               The Waitress comes by.

                                     WAITRESS
                              (snippy; to Kate)
                         Coffee?

                                     KATE
                         Please.

               Bandit watches as she takes a sip.

                                     KATE
                         Jesus!!!

                                     BANDIT
                         Trucker coffee. It's three times 
                         stronger. Good for a hundred miles. 
                         That, a coupla perks, and you can 
                         leap tall buildings in a single bound.

                                     WAITRESS
                              (calling O.S.)
                         Order up!

                                     BANDIT
                         That's me.

               He gulps down a half a cup of coffee and rises.

                                     BANDIT
                         See ya, Kate.

                                     KATE
                         Ciao.

               TRACK WITH BANDIT

               moving quickly to the counter to pick up his order. Behind 
               him; we notice one of the Truckers from the next booth gets 
               up and crosses to Kate.

               Bandit reaches in his pocket to pay for the order:

                                     WAITRESS
                              (seductive)
                         Sure I can't interest you in anything 
                         else?

                                     BANDIT
                              (smiles)
                         Another time.

               Bandit picks up his order and turns toward the door. He sees 
               the Trucker talking to Kate. The Trucker's buddies have turned 
               around in their booth and are all over her.

               Bandit sets the food down on the counter and crosses to the 
               booth.

                                     KATE
                              (to Truckers)
                         -- Believe me, fellas; I'd love to 
                         schmoos, but...

                                     TRUCKER #1
                         Don't be so conceited. You don't 
                         even know us.

                                     TRUCKER #2
                              (an ugly dude)
                         To know us, is to love us.

               Bandit steps between them.

                                     BANDIT
                         Hey, how y'all doin'?

                                     TRUCKER #2
                         Who wants to know?

                                     BANDIT
                         Listen, guys; I'm in a rush. Otherwise 
                         I'd arrange it so they had to carry 
                         you outta here in doggie bags.

                                     TRUCKER #1
                         You and what goddamn army?

               The Truckers all turn to Bandit, ready to mop the floor with 
               him. The restaurant is silent, except for Willie Nelson, now 
               singing on the juke box. Every eye is on them. A brawl looks 
               inevitable.

                                     KATE
                              (worried)
                         Bandit, please...

                                     TRUCKER #2
                              (totally surprised, 
                              almost yelling)
                         Bandit?!? You're the Bandit? The 
                         fella been runnin' the blue troopers 
                         ragged?

               Bandit looks around self-consciously. Nods.

                                     TRUCKER #2
                         Lemme shake your hand, boy! You're 
                         my new goddamn idol.

                                     TRUCKER #1
                              (slapping Bandit on 
                              the back)
                         You're the rage of CB land. We been 
                         followin' you for hours.

                                     TRUCKER #2
                         If we'da known you was the Bandit, 
                         we wouldn't a never lipped off to 
                         your old lady.

                                     BANDIT
                         Well, she's not exactly my...

                                     TRUCKER #3
                              (jumping in)
                         Lemme have your autograph, hoss!

               Everyone in the restaurant crowds around Bandit and he starts 
               hurriedly signing autographs.

                                     KATE
                         I've done twenty-eight Broadway shows 
                         and no one's ever asked me for an 
                         autograph.

               Then:

                                     BANDIT
                              (to the group, starting 
                              off)
                         Listen, guys, I gotta cover ground. 
                         I'm due in Atlanta in less than ten 
                         hours.

                                     TRUCKER #1
                         Good luck.

                                     TRUCKER #2
                         Give our best to Jimmy Carter.

               Kate slips out of the booth, as Bandit crosses back to the 
               counter.

               ANGLE - COUNTER

               Bandit grabs his order and finds the OWNER facing him -- 
               holding out Bandit's money.

                                     OWNER
                         It's on the house.

                                     BANDIT
                              (grins)
                         Thanks.

               He turns to leave.

                                     OWNER
                         Son...

               Bandit turns back.

                                     OWNER
                         Godspeed.

               Bandit smiles. Then starts out. He notices Kate is gone. 
               Shrugs. Heads out the door.

               OUTSIDE THE TRUCK STOP - DAY

               Bandit bolts out in time to see his Cobra pulling out, about 
               to take off.

               NEW ANGLE

               as Bandit leaps off the steps and races toward the car, just 
               as it peels out. He swings the passenger door open and is 
               half in -- half out, as the Cobra skids out the truck stop, 
               over the curb and onto the highway. The door's still wide 
               open. Bandit hanging on.

               INSIDE BANDIT I

               Kate's behind the wheel. She tromps on it and the car takes 
               off like greased lightening. Bandit's struggling to stay in 
               the car.

                                     BANDIT
                              (hanging on)
                         What the hell are you doing?!?

                                     KATE
                              (gestures over her 
                              shoulder)
                         He's after us again!

               Kate whips around a corner almost throwing Bandit onto the 
               pavement. He grabs her arm and manages to pull himself into 
               the car and slam the door. He looks back.

               HIS VIEW - THRU REAR WINDOW

               Sheriff Clayton's Texas Highway Patrol car is after them 
               again. Siren blasting.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Bandit turns to Kate.

                                     BANDIT
                         You know this guy, don't you?

                                     KATE
                              (driving hard, eyes 
                              on the road)
                         I've never seen him before in my 
                         life. I'm just trying to help you 
                         out.

                                     BANDIT
                         By stealing my car?

                                     KATE
                         I would've come back for you.

                                     BANDIT
                              (not believing)
                         Yeah.

                                     KATE
                              (turning to him, dead 
                              serious)
                         Yeah.

               She wraps a corner doing 60, hits the highway and puts it to 
               the floor. Clayton's battered up car is still coming on 
               strong.

               INSIDE THE CLAYTON'S CAR - MOVING

               Sheriff Clayton's eyes are glazed as he tears after Bandit 
               I.

                                     CLAYTON
                              (to himself)
                         I'm gonna get you, you dirty, 
                         stinking, rotten sumbitch.

               BACK TO BANDIT

               Kate at the wheel.

                                     KATE
                         Look, the truth is, I didn't want to 
                         be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted 
                         to go on with you. I needed an excuse.

                                     BANDIT
                         You could've asked.

                                     KATE
                         You might have said no. I have trouble 
                         handling rejection.

               THE HIGHWAY

               Bandit I streaks past, Kate driving. A beat and a big rig, 
               hauling a crane comes out of a side road. The truck moves 
               slowly down the highway -- a wide load.

               SHERIFF CLAYTON'S CAR

               roaring up.

               INSIDE THE CAR

               Clayton floors it and hunches low over the wheel as he passes 
               the truck -- afraid the crane's going to take off his head.

               FULL SHOT

               as Sheriff Clayton's car zooms under the crane, clearing it 
               by a hair. But the crane rips off Clayton's lights and siren. 
               Leaving only wires and a gaping hole in the roof of the car.

               ARKANSAS HIGHWAY - DAY

               Bandit I streaking. Kate takes a dangerous curve doing 85. 
               Bandit gasps, but Kate holds her own.

                                     BANDIT
                         Where did you learn how to drive 
                         like this?

                                     KATE
                         Like what?

               He smiles.

                                     KATE
                         My first father was a redneck. He 
                         taught me how to drive fast and pants 
                         people.

               Bandit picks up the CB mike, flicking the crystal selector 
               two stops.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         Breaker, this is Bandit I, how are 
                         your vocal cords?

               INTERCUT - BANDIT I AND II

               Cledus takes his mike. Fred is on all fours in the now chewed-
               up front seat. Bouncing around.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (into mike)
                         My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's 
                         ain't. He's been barking, eating the 
                         seats and driving me crackers.
                              (Fred barks)
                         Hear that? Where's his chow?

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, 
                         okay?

                                     CLEDUS
                              (into mike)
                         Do I have a choice?

                              (into mike)
                         'Bout fourteen miles this side of 
                         Mississippi.

               CLEDUS' VIEW

               up ahead -- an Arkansas Highway Patrol car is parked off to 
               the side, hidden by a clump of Magnolia Trees.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Cledus brings it down to 55 and rolls past TWO OFFICERS 
               standing next to their car, holding a radar gun.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (into mike)
                         I just passed two Kojacks with a 
                         Kodak.
                              (then)
                         Man, this highway's crawling with 
                         Bears. Ain't no way we gonna make 
                         Atlanta on time without you runnin' 
                         blocker.

               Bandit looks back over his shoulder. Then:

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         I'm still trying to ditch this Texas 
                         Smokey. I don't know what the sucker 
                         wants.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (into mike)
                         What they all want -- to handcuff a 
                         hero.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         As far as John Law knows, I'm just a 
                         joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 
                         'em outta your backyard, we're cool.
                              (looking back again)
                         Now just give me five to ditch this 
                         idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (into mike)
                         If you don't, we can kiss that 
                         Kenworth good-bye.

               Bandit replaces the mike, glances up to the rear view.

               HIS VIEW - THROUGH REAR VIEW MIRROR

               Sheriff Clayton -- gaining ground.

               BACK TO SCENE

               They're speeding around curves now, Kate doing her best to 
               control the Cobra. She takes a corner too fast and too wide. 
               Bandit I drifts into the oncoming lane and suddenly they're 
               staring at:

               A CAMPER

               coming straight at them. A Mother, Father and Two Children 
               all riding in the front seat.

               FULL SHOT

               Kate swerves back into her lane, avoiding a head-on by less 
               than a split second.

                                     BANDIT
                         I think we should switch seats.

               He puts his hands on the steering wheel and his foot on the 
               accelerator, but he and Kate get tangled up trying to make 
               the switch.

               The car goes out of control -- smashes into a guard railing 
               and bounces back onto the highway.

               They try to switch again. Impossible.

                                     BANDIT
                              (fastening seat belt)
                         You go ahead. This seat's more 
                         comfortable.

               THE HIGHWAY - DAY - HIGH SHOT

               Bandit I streaking, followed in the distance by the Texas 
               Highway Patrol car.

               Coming down the highway, from the opposite direction -- is a 
               long, long, long FUNERAL PROCESSION.

               Suddenly, Bandit I swerves to the right and starts across 
               the highway.

                                     BANDIT (V.O.)
                         Mississippi's the other way!

                                     KATE (V.O.)
                         You want to lose this putz or not?!?

               With that, Bandit I zips between two limos heading the Funeral 
               Procession, crosses the highway, sails over the embankment 
               and swerves onto a bumpy dirt path.

               CAMERA WHIPS BACK

               to Sheriff Clayton's car -- roaring straight at us.

               INSIDE CLAYTON'S CAR

               Sheriff Clayton spots Bandit I across the highway, flying 
               down the bumpy dirt path. He hits his brakes and the car 
               screeches to a halt.

               ANGLE - CLAYTON

               forced to sit and wait, as the Funeral Procession passes 
               slowly by. He's livid. Lays on the horn.

               THE HIGHWAY - DAY

               as the vehicles in the passing lane are all forced to come 
               to a halt to avoid crashing into Clayton -- who sits in the 
               middle of the highway waiting for the endless Funeral 
               Procession to pass. Horns honk. People yell. Clayton waits.

               THE BUMPY DIRT PATH

               Bandit I bounces along, past rows and rows of tall Magnolia 
               trees.

               INSIDE BANDIT

               Kate and Bandit bouncing from seat to ceiling.

                                     KATE
                              (motor-mouthing)
                         -- You know, I used to be a high 
                         fashion model. Tried it for six months 
                         and almost freaked. Makeup, silly 
                         clothes, a little man saying 'darling' 
                         every two seconds...

                                     BANDIT
                         Yeah, it's tough when your cheek-
                         bones are your main asset.

                                     KATE
                              (nods, then sees 
                              something O.S.)
                         Uh-oh.

               WHAT SHE SEES

               up ahead. The path ends. There's an incline and past that a 
               long low fence. There's no way around or past it.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Kate and Bandit look back. The Funeral Procession has almost 
               passed. Clayton's is waiting. Gunning his engine. He ain't 
               giving up.

                                     BANDIT
                         I think you'd better let me...

               Before Bandit can finish, Kate trounces on it, driving 
               straight toward the fence.

               RACING ANGLE

               as Bandit I blasts toward the incline, hits it doing 70 and 
               sails over the fence.

               THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE

               we HEAR the CRACK of a baseball bat and a CENTER FIELDER, in 
               full uniform, takes off after a long fly ball. He stops in 
               his tracks at what he sees.

               REVERSE ANGLE

               as Bandit I flies over the fence and lands in the middle of 
               a MINOR LEAGUE BASEBALL GAME.

               The Center Fielder is absolutely flabbergasted, as Kate 
               straightens out the Shelby Cobra and takes off across the 
               baseball field.

               She roars over second base and does a 360° fishtail in the 
               middle of the pitchers mound. PLAYERS scatter in every 
               direction.

               NEW ANGLE - MOVING

               as Kate speeds past the dugout and a CHEERING CROWD, back to 
               an access road.

               Up ahead. The highway. And safety.

               INSIDE BANDIT I

               Kate looks over to Bandit, a huge grin on her face.

                                     KATE
                         Baseball needs a little pizzazz.

               BACK ON THE HIGHWAY

               The Funeral Procession finally passes and Clayton zooms across 
               the highway and onto the bumpy dirt path.

               BACK ON THE DIRT PATH

               Sheriff Clayton's car comes to a sliding halt in front of 
               the fence. He looks around for some sign of Bandit I. Nothing. 
               They've vanished.

                                     CLAYTON
                              (to himself)
                         This is beginning to piss me off.

               The path is far too narrow to turn around, so as he begins 
               the arduous chore of driving in reverse down the long narrow 
               path, knocking off his remaining hub caps on the way, we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               HIGHWAY SIGN

               reading Welcome to Mississippi. A black streak whizzes past.

               INSIDE BANDIT I - MOVING

               Kate still at the wheel. Bandit on the CB.

                                     BANDIT

                                     CLEDUS (V.O.)
                              (from CB)
                         I'm at marker eight-five.

                         Son-of-a-gun. Me too.

               BANDIT II

               moving along the highway. Cledus looks out the sideview window 
               of the big eighteen-wheeler.

               HIS VIEW - THROUGH SIDEVIEW MIRROR

               Bandit I coming up to his back door.

               BACK TO SCENE

               as Cledus signals with his arm and pulls the, rig off to the 
               side of the road.

               The door opens and Cledus climbs down the metal steps of the 
               truck, followed by Fred. They both take a long, healthy 
               stretch, as Bandit I pulls to a stop behind them.

               NEW ANGLE

               Bandit and Kate get out of the Cobra. Cledus is surprised to 
               see her. She immediately crosses to him and offers her hand.

                                     KATE
                         I'm Kate. You must be Cledus.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (shaking hands, 
                              awkwardly)
                         Yes, ma'am.

                                     KATE
                         How's your twenty?

               Cledus doesn't get it. Bandit laughs, unwraps the hamburger.

                                     BANDIT
                         Here you go, pal.

               He holds the hamburger out for the dog, who wolfs it down in 
               one bite, then goes off to relieve himself.

               Cledus takes Bandit by the arm and pulls him aside.

                                     CLEDUS
                         I thought you were dumping the chick 
                         at the truck stop.

                                     BANDIT
                         I ran into complications.

                                     CLEDUS
                         I hate to say it...

                                     BANDIT
                         Then don't.

                                     CLEDUS

                         -- But everytime we've ever messed

                         but...

                                     BANDIT
                              (interupts)
                         Just don't worry about it.
                              (then)
                         How we doin' timewise?

                                     CLEDUS
                         Not good enough to be standing here 
                         shooting the bull.

                                     BANDIT
                              (turns to leave)
                         We're gone.

                                     CLEDUS
                         Bandit?

               Bandit turns to him.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (referring to Kate)
                         Nice ass.

               Bandit grins, moves to the car.

                                     BANDIT
                              (whistles to Kate)
                         Let's hit it.

                                     KATE
                              (crossing to Bandit I)
                         Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on 
                         truckin'.

               Cledus smiles, as Bandit and Kate climb into the Cobra. Bandit 
               starts the engine and they're off.

               Cledus pulls a crowbar out of the rig and begins hitting all 
               his tires. Checking them out. As he does this:

                                     CLEDUS
                              (calling)
                         Let's roll, Fred.

               Cledus finishes the tires, but Fred isn't moving.

                                     CLEDUS
                         C'mon, Fred.

               Nothing. The dog stares at him. Cledus takes a step forward. 
               Fred takes a step backward. Cledus takes two steps forward. 
               And Fred takes off. Running through the woods.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (running after him)
                         Fred!!!!!!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE BANDIT I

               rolling. They're silent for a long time. Then:

                                     KATE
                         You plan on driving trucks all your 
                         life?

                         No, actually I was thinking of 
                         becoming a brain surgeon.

               She laughs, as we:

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               CLEDUS CHASING FRED

               through the woods. As he's about to nab him, the Dog cuts 
               right and Cledus sprawls left.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               Kate and Bandit. Talking. More relaxed.

                                     BANDIT
                         -- Trucking ain't the easiest life 
                         in the world. I mean, you can't make 
                         it much past fifty and you sure as 
                         shit don't get a gold watch when you 
                         hang it all up. But I like keeping 
                         on the move. You know?

                                     KATE
                         Do I know? I'm an authority on it.

                                     BANDIT
                         I guess if there's one lesson I've 
                         learned, it's that even misery has a 
                         tough time hitting a moving target.
                              (then, realizing)
                         I forgot your question?

                         I... uh... I don't know. I guess 
                         don't like to think about it.

                                     KATE
                         Then let's change the subject.
                              (a beat)
                         What do you think about forced school 
                         busing?

               And:

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               CLEDUS RACING AFTER FRED

               gaining ground. A flying tackle. And he snares him. Cledus 
               is out of breath and pissed. Fred licks his face.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               INSIDE BANDIT I

               Bandit spots a green sedan with a radio-mike antenna coming 
               in the other direction. He backs off the accelerator.

                                     KATE
                         Your foot fall asleep?

               Bandit shakes his head, reaching for the CB.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         Bandit two, Smokey in a plain brown 
                         wrapper coming your way. Over.

               No answer from Cledus. Kate has no idea what Bandit's just 
               said.

                                     BANDIT
                              (explaining to Kate)
                         An unmarked police car.

                                     KATE
                         How do you know?

                                     BANDIT
                         I know.
                              (into mike)
                         Bandit two, bring yourself on in.

               Still no answer.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         What's the matter, Cledus? You got 
                         mike fright?
                              (a beat, then)
                         Bandit two, do you copy?

               INTERCUT - BANDIT I AND II

               Cledus, exhausted and sweaty, tosses Fred into the eighteen-
               wheeler and lunges for the CB mike.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (into mike)
                         Yeah, yeah, yeah? What's up?

               Bandit glances up in the rear view mirror, sees the Smokey 
               in a plain wrapper take an off ramp. Harmless.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         Never mind. It's nothing.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (into mike)
                         Anything else you don't want me to 
                         know?

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         Nope. Just keep those wheels churning.

               Cledus hangs up the mike, starts his rig, checks for oncoming 
               and pulls onto the highway. Fred's head sticks out the window, 
               his ears flapping in the wind.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE HIGHWAY - DAY - AERIAL SHOT

               Bandit I and Bandit II whizzing down the highway. Picking up 
               time. OVER this, Kate sings "Jolene" along with Dolly Parton 
               on the radio.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INSIDE BANDIT I - LATER

               Bandit notices a broken-down FORD with its hood up, parked 
               off the highway. He veers the Cobra off the road, quickly 
               opens the glove compartment, takes out two screwdrivers and 
               hands one to Kate. She stops singing.

                                     BANDIT
                              (explaining)
                         I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out 
                         an all-points.

                                     KATE
                              (opening door)
                         You take the front, I'll take the 
                         back.

               A MISSISSIPPI LICENSE PLATE

               fills the screen. Then the screeching of burning rubber and 
               Bandit I pulls away from camera -- now wearing the Mississippi 
               plates. And we:

                                                          DISSOLVE THRU TO:

                         I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.

               Bandit I takes an off ramp, as Bandit II continues sailing 
               down the highway.

               UNION 76 STATION

               off the main highway. Bandit I pulls up to one of several 
               islands in the large station. Trucks are gassing up at various 
               pumps.

               BANDIT I

               Kate climbs out.

                         Save my seat.

               She starts toward the Ladies Room as a young BLACK ATTENDANT 
               struts up to Bandit I.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         Say, Cobra: what's your pleasure?

                                     BANDIT
                         Fill it.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         Check the hood, my man?

               Bandit shakes his head "no."

                                     ATTENDANT
                         Aw right. This is a clean machine. 
                         Yeah, I was thinking 'bout getting 
                         me one of these myself. But I figure 
                         I'm conspicuous enough to the police 
                         as it is, so why encourage them more, 
                         if you know what I mean.

                                     BANDIT
                         Yeah, I know what you mean.

               The Attendant starts pumping Supreme. Bandit leans back in 
               the seat. Closes his eyes.

               Suddenly, from his CB.

                                     A VOICE
                              (over CB)
                         Bandit, do you read me? Over.

               Bandit snaps his eyes open. Who the hell is this? He grabs 
               his mike.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         This is Bandit. Who we got on that

                         for the law, but what's your problem, 
                         man?

                                     CLAYTON
                              (into mike)
                         You.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         Yeah, well I kinda figured that.

                                     CLAYTON
                              (into mike)
                         You know, you may think you're gonna 
                         get away, but I promise you, everytime 
                         you turn around, I'll be there, 
                         breathing down your neck.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         Well, if your breath is as sweet as 
                         your personality, I got a lot to 
                         look forward to. Adios.

               Bandit hangs up the mike, as Kate comes back sipping an orange 
               soda. She hops into the front seat, as the Attendant struts 
               back over.

               NEW ANGLE

               as camera begins to slowly PULL AWAY from Bandit I.

                                     ATTENDANT
                              (to Bandit)
                         That'll be eight-seventy two.

               Bandit hands him a bill.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         -- Outta ten.

               Camera has now PULLED BACK enough to see:

               SHERIFF CLAYTON'S CAR

               parked on the other side of the gas station. The car's front 
               end has been lifted high into the air by a hydraulic jack 
               and ANOTHER ATTENDANT is changing a tire and replacing a 
               broken headlight.

               Clayton sits in the battered Sheriff's car, having no idea 
               Bandit I is in the very same station.

               FULL SHOT - THE GAS STATION

               as Bandit gets his change from the ATTENDANT.

                                     ATTENDANT
                              (to Bandit)
                         Have a smooth one, Cobra.

               Bandit nods, throws the Cobra into gear, takes off.

               RUNNING ANGLE

               as Bandit I sails right past the Texas Sheriff's car.

               CLOSE - CLAYTON

               His head whips around, when he sees Bandit I roar out of the 
               station back back onto the highway. He's absolutely stunned.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Clayton starts his engine and stomps on it... totally 
               forgetting his front end is up on jacks. Clayton's car takes 
               off on its rear wheels, sails halfway across the gas station, 
               and slams head-on into a BRAND NEW CONTINENTAL.

               As the Continental sails across the islands:

               CLOSE - ON CLAYTON

               Watching in horror. Then, trying to compose himself.

                                     CLAYTON
                              (muttering to himself)
                         It's all right. It's not your car. 
                         You're doing fine. Just keep going.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MISSISSIPPI HIGHWAY - DAY

               Bandit I roars back onto blacktop. Hammer down.

                         -- Looks like a clear shot to the

               AN AERIAL VIEW

               of a long expanse of Mississippi Highway. Bandit I gaining 
               ground and finally roaring past Bandit II. Running blocker.

               Over this:

                         Pick it up, Breaker.

                                     VOICE
                         Thanks for the break. Bandit, this 
                         here's the Dixie Chicken.

                                     BANDIT (V.O.)
                         What's up, Dixie Chicken?

                                     KATE (V.O.)
                         Ask if he delivers?...

                                     DIXIE CHICKEN (V.O.)
                         Been hearin' all 'bout y'all and

                         hair of y'all.

               As Bandit I disappears around a bend in the highway, with 
               Bandit II following in the distance, we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANOTHER SECTION OF THE MISSISSIPPI HIGHWAY - DAY

               close to the Alabama State Line. Hilly. Empty. Suddenly, 
               from over the top of a hill, comes Bandit I. As it races 
               toward camera.

                                     SHERIFF CLAYTON (V.O.)
                         -- This is Sheriff Buell Clayton,

               INSIDE BANDIT I - A FEW MINUTES LATER

               Kate finds another stray cigarette under the seat and lights 
               it, as they speed toward the Alabama State Line.

                                     BANDIT
                         I'm proud of you.

                                     KATE
                         Yeah?

                                     BANDIT
                         You only smoked three cigarettes 
                         through the entire state of 
                         Mississippi.

               Then, something grabs them O.S.

               WHAT THEY SEE

               Three MISSISSIPPI HIGHWAY PATROL CARS. Lights swirling. Formed 
               in a solid roadblock. Waiting for Bandit.

                                     BANDIT
                         Good-byes are always tough.

               He immediately swerves the wheel to the right and makes a 
               sliding turn off the highway.

               HIGH SHOT

               The countryside. As Bandit I blasts across a grassy knoll 
               and heads toward a steep hill.

               ANGLE - THE HIGHWAY PATROL CARS

               as they take off after Bandit I. Sirens screaming.

               RUNNING ANGLE - BANDIT

               Bandit slams the Cobra into first and starts up the steep 
               grassy hill. There's no path. No road. He's got to make his 
               own.

               FULL SHOT

               Bandit I and the Three Mississippi Highway Patrol cars roar 
               up the steep hill. Climbing. Higher. Higher.

               THE TOP OF THE HILL

               Bandit I rolls over the top.

               INSIDE BANDIT

               as Bandit and Kate look over the other side. Almost straight 
               down. Treacherous. They look back.

               THEIR VIEW

               The Three Mississippi Highway Patrol cars coming on strong.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Bandit trounces on it and the Cobra sails over the top and 
               starts down the incline.

               INSIDE BANDIT I - BANDIT AND KATE'S VIEW

               of the roller coaster ride down. Bandit and Kate's stomachs 
               dropping to their toes.

               FULL SHOT

               as the First Highway Patrol car reaches the top -- and without 
               braking -- blasts over, sailing straight into the air.

               NEW ANGLE

               The Highway Patrol car crashes down on its two front wheels. 
               Flips. And rolls end-over-end down the steep incline. Crashing 
               into a tree, halfway down.

               THE TOP OF THE HILL

               As the Second Mississippi Highway Patrol car almost makes it 
               to the top, its wheels start spinning in the thick grass.

               The Driver loses it -- and suddenly, the car starts rolling 
               backward, down the steep hill. Out of control.

               THE THIRD HIGHWAY PATROL CAR

               whips around the Second, as it rolls right past him -- doing 
               60 per in reverse.

               The Third car makes it to the top of the incline. Waits. 
               Looks down.

               HIS VIEW

               The steep incline. The First Highway Patrol car halfway down -- 
               on its back. Out of it.

               And Bandit I. Roaring down the hill. Toward freedom.

               BACK TO SCENE

               As the Third Highway Patrol car makes a decision, flies over 
               the top. And starts tearing after Bandit.

               RACING ANGLE

               as Bandit I reaches the bottom of the hill, makes a sliding 
               turn onto a rocky road running alongside a stream.

               As he roars down the road, the lone Mississippi Highway Patrol 
               car reaches the bottom of the hill, slides onto the road and 
               takes off in hot pursuit.

               ON THE ROAD

               Bandit I screaming down the road, the Mississippi Highway 
               Patrol car on top of him.

                                     VOICE FROM MISSISSIPPI HPC
                              (over loudspeaker)
                         Pull over, Bandit. This road's a 
                         dead end. It's all over for you, 
                         boy!

               INSIDE BANDIT

               Bandit looks up ahead. The son-of-a-bitch is right. Dead 
               end.

               FULL SHOT

               as Bandit immediately wheels the Cobra over the embankment, 
               down the other side, into the stream. He punches it and as 
               water covers the Cobra, Bandit roars through the stream, 
               swerving the wheel to the right, staying on rocks.

               NEW ANGLE

               The Highway Patrol car comes reeling over the embankment and 
               splashes into the stream. It takes off after Bandit I, hits 
               a rock, goes broadside and slides into deep water. Stuck.

               THE HIGHWAY PATROL CAR

               Water rising to the car's window, the OFFICER watches 
               helplessly, as Bandit bumps across the stream, over the 
               shoulder, back onto the highway and into the state of Alabama. 
               Leaving only thirty feet of rubber to remember him by.

               THE HIGHWAY - DAY - HIGH SHOT

               As Bandit I disappears into the Alabama mountains.

               A beat, and a big eighteen-wheeler rolls across the state 
               line. Bandit II. Doing a cool 55. Georgia bound.

                                                              DISSOLVE TO: 

               THE ALABAMA MOUNTAINS - DAY

               Bandit I weaves through the mountains. Taking turns fast. 
               Making time. Passing signs that read: Curves Ahead, Slippery 
               When Wet, Slow, etc.

               Bandit II is keeping pace. Smokestacks blasting.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ALABAMA/MISSISSIPPI STATE LINE - DAY

               A TOW TRUCK is pulling the Mississippi Highway Patrol car 
               out of the drink, while a REPAIR CREW attempts to turn over 
               the Highway Patrol car stuck halfway up the hill.

               TWO ADDITIONAL TOW TRUCKS stand by, waiting to haul off the 
               other Patrol cars.

               NEW ANGLE

               Sheriff Clayton's car comes driving up. Its front end is now 
               totalled and the front window is shattered.

               INSIDE CLAYTON'S CAR

               Sheriff Clayton sees the commotion, pulls his car across the 
               highway and parks. He climbs out, leaving the front door 
               open.

                                     CLAYTON
                              (approaching Tow Truck 
                              Driver)
                         What happened?

                         Bandit.

               Clayton looks out over the mess. Winces.

               Suddenly, a giant EIGHTEEN-WHEELER, hauling a wide load of 
               lumber comes barrelling down the highway. Clayton's door is 
               still standing open and the Eighteen-wheeler rips the "Texas 
               Sheriff's" door right off its hinges, sending it soaring 
               thirty feet into the air.

               INSIDE THE EIGHTEEN-WHEELER

               A TRUCKER with a flattop grins to himself. Cops. Fuck 'em.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BANDIT I - MOVING - DAY

               Taking the curves. Holding the shoulder. Kate is lying back 
               in the seat with her eyes closed. From the radio, Charlie 
               Rich sings, "Behind Closed Doors." Bandit drives. Hums along.

               Rain drops begin hitting the windshield. Bandit flips on the 
               wipers and reaches for his CB. Turns it two stops. Now, the 
               rain really comes down. An Alabama thundershower.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         Bandit two, come on.

               INTERCUT - BANDIT I AND II

               Fred sleeps with his head on Cledus' lap. Cledus picks up

                         I'm all ears, good buddy.

                         You're gonna hit some heavy 
                         precipitation in about six minutes. 
                         Better let your flaps down, these 
                         roads are killers when they're damp.

                              fuel gauge)
                         It shouldn't last. Gives me time to 
                         take a go-go juice break.

                                     BANDIT

                         We'll be waiting. Over.

               Bandit hangs up the mike and pulls the Cobra to a stop under 
               a clump of trees.

                                     KATE

                         Are we in Atlanta already?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BANDIT II - MOVING - DAY

               Cledus spots a truck stop up ahead and backs off the hammer.

               TRUCK STOP - DAY

               as the eighteen-wheeler pulls in front of a gasoline pump. 
               Cledus opens the door, climbs down the metal steps and 
               stretches his legs. He motions for the ATTENDANT to fill her 
               up, then starts toward the restaurant, passing a couple of 
               rigs and a long row of chromed choppers parked in front.

               INSIDE THE TRUCK STOP

               four greasy walls. And that's about it except for an old, 
               beaten-up pool table. Cledus enters followed by Fred. As 
               usual, the jukebox is playing. This time, it's "Baby Boy" by 
               Mary Kay Place.

               About a dozen people sitting around, seven of which are bad-
               looking BIKERS and their MAMAS. Cledus crosses to the counter. 
               He's greeted by the OWNER, a fat black man. There's a CB on 
               the counter.

                                     CLEDUS
                         Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla 
                         cups of hot stuff.

                                     OWNER
                              (taking order)
                         You pass that funky Cobra on the 
                         highway?

                                     CLEDUS
                         Uh-uh. What Cobra?

                                     OWNER
                         Some boy named Bandit's been givin' 
                         the Highway Patrol shit fits.

                                     CLEDUS
                         Oh, yeah. Good for him.

                                     OWNER
                         I don't know where he's goin' or 
                         what he's doin', but I sure hope to 
                         God he makes it.

               Cledus grins, then crosses to the pay phone. Fred tags along.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE BANDIT I

               pulled off the highway. Rain glistens off the windshield. 
               Time stands still.

                                     BANDIT
                         Kate...

                                     KATE
                         Ummm?

                                     BANDIT
                         I been thinking. Maybe I should drop 
                         you in Montgomery. I mean, the way 
                         things are going, it might get pretty 
                         hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.

                                     KATE
                         Forget it. This is one of the longest 
                         relationships I've ever had. I'm not 
                         blowing it now.

               He grins. From the radio:

                                     DISC JOCKEY
                              (from radio)
                         I'm gonna dedicate this next one to 
                         a man out there who's capturing the 
                         hearts of us all. Hey, Bandit; take 
                         care of yourself and your woman. 
                         Hear? It's raining out and the Red-
                         Headed Stranger's singing this one 
                         especially for you.

               And from the radio, Willie Nelson sings, "Blue Eyes Crying 
               In The Rain." Bandit and Kate look at each other for a long 
               moment...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE THE TRUCK STOP

               Cledus is talking on the phone, Fred waiting nearby. A BIKER 
               waits to use the phone.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (into phone)
                         Hey, pumpkin pie, how you doin'? I 
                         should be home real soon. Yeah, Fred's 
                         fine. Still po'ed? See, time heals 
                         all wounds. Anyway, just wanted to 
                         check in. Okay, sweetie. You too. 
                         Bye-bye.

               Cledus hangs up.

                                     BIKER
                         Hey, man; this your goddam mutt?

               Cledus nods.

                                     BIKER
                         He just bit me.

                                     CLEDUS
                         Fred? C'mon, man; he don't bite.

               Cledus begins walking back toward the counter.

                                     BIKER
                         I said the mother bit me.

                                     CLEDUS
                         He couldn'ta bit you. He's got better 
                         taste than that.

               Laughter O.S. Suddenly, the Biker tries kicking Fred. Fred 
               leaps back. Baring his teeth. Scared.

                                     CLEDUS
                         Hey, back off, huh!?!

                                     BIKER
                         Animals like this should be put to 
                         sleep.

                                     ANOTHER BIKER
                         Yeah, let's put the poor little 
                         sumbitch outta his misery.

               The other bikers chime in their approval, as the First Biker 
               takes a pool cue off the wall rack and starts toward Fred.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (angry)
                         Hey, pal; I told you. Cut that shit 
                         out.

               But the Biker isn't listening. He starts to swing the cue at 
               Fred, but Cledus whirls and slams his fist into the Biker's 
               pock-marked face blowing him into the jukebox. The record 
               skips and jumps to Merle Haggard's "live version" of "Okie 
               From Muskogee." Loud.

               Instantly, the other bikers are on their feet. A TRUCKER 
               stands to help Cledus and is immediately cold-cocked.

               MOVING ANGLE - HAND HELD

               Cledus sees he's in the middle of a powder keg -- with no 
               way out. He backs up toward the pool table, grabs a cue.

                                     OWNER
                              (yelling)
                         Hey, c'mon fellas...

               Cledus swings the pool cue. The bikers split up. Move around 
               him. He can't watch them all. Then like clockwork, they all 
               rush him. Three from the front, two from the side, one over 
               the top of the pool table.

               Cledus nails one of them with a pool cue to the nuts. The 
               Biker screams and doubles over. A Biker flies over the pool 
               table and crashes into Cledus from behind -- knocking the 
               pool cue away. Another Biker rushes in, but gets Cledus' 
               Frye Boot in the gut for his trouble.

               But then the other two nail Cledus from each side and it's 
               over. They've got him. Cledus tries to shake himself loose, 
               but the First Biker, picks himself up from the jukebox, 
               strolls over and lets him have it twice in the groin. Cledus 
               doubles over. Onto the ground.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               as the three bikers pick Cledus up and toss him into the 
               air, over to the other three bikers. They catch him and toss 
               him back again.

               A beat, then they run toward the window, still carrying 
               Cledus. They swing him back and forth. One. Two. Three. Then, 
               they toss him out the window.

               OUTSIDE THE TRUCK STOP - DAY

               Glass shatters, as Cledus comes flying through the window, 
               landing face down in the gravel. With a thud. Wait. And Fred 
               is tossed out after him.

               CLOSER ANGLE

               Cledus slowly pulls himself up, trying to hold back his anger 
               and humiliation. He begins walking. Fred follows. Camera 
               stays:

               CLOSE - ON CLEDUS - TRACKING

               as he starts toward Bandit II. He passes something off-screen. 
               The trace of a smile crosses his face. He keeps walking.

               From O.S.

                                     ATTENDANT (O.S.)
                         That's seventy-three eighty-four.

               We stay CLOSE on Cledus, as he reaches into his pocket and 
               hands the Attendant some bills off-camera. Doesn't break 
               stride. We're still close. Tracking.

               A few more steps and a bag ENTERS FRAME. Cledus takes it.

                                     OWNER (O.S.)
                         Pay me next time through, son.

               Cledus nods, takes the bag. Keeps walking. Up to the truck. 
               Climbing the steps.

               ANGLE - THRU WINDSHIELD - TIGHT

               Cledus settles into the truck.

               Fred climbs over him, into the shotgun position. HOLD on 
               Cledus, as he fires up the big eighteen-wheeler. He glances 
               again at something off-screen. And his smile becomes a little 
               wider.

               ANGLE - THE GEARSHIFT

               Cledus' gloved hand jams the big rig into gear. The truck 
               leaps forward. And now:

               FULL SHOT

               of the eighteen-wheeler, as it roars toward the long line of 
               Chromed Choppers -- knocking them to the ground and rolling 
               right over them. Crunch!!!!

               NEW ANGLE

               watching Bandit II, as it keeps on rolling. Out of the parking 
               lot and back onto the highway. Leaving behind:

               THE CHOPPERS

               Complete wrecks. Chrome. Mirrors. Fenders. Tires. All crushed 
               and mutilated. These bikes will never ride again.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE HIGHWAY

               Bandit II, rolling. Over:

                                     CLEDUS (V.O.)
                         Bandit I, bring yourself in.

               INSIDE BANDIT

               Bandit and Kate kissing. The first time. Tenderly. The rain 
               has turned to a light drizzle.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (from CB)
                         Bandit I, do you copy?

               Bandit and Kate break the kiss. Look at each other. Bandit 
               reaches for the mike.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         We're listening, Bandit II. Back.

               INTERCUT - BANDIT I AND II

               Cledus feels better. He's eating a sloppy joe with one hand 
               and driving with the other. The two cups of coffee are resting 
               in coffee holders, attached to the dash.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (into mike)
                         Ran into a little hassle at the eatum-
                         up-stop.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         You okay?

                                     CLEDUS
                              (into mike)
                         Just fine. What's the weather like?

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         God's back on our side, so let's get 
                         smokin'.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (into mike)
                         Roger. Keep the shiny side up and 
                         the greasy side down.
                              (then)
                         Right, Fred?

               Fred barks. Cledus drives on, more determined than ever.

               INSIDE BANDIT

               Bandit fires up the Cobra.

                         How 'bout one more for the road?

               Bandit turns to her and they kiss again. And we:

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE ALABAMA MOUNTAINS - DAY

               The roads are slick, but Bandit I and II take them hard and 
               fast. Over:

                                     BANDIT
                              (over CB)

                         It's gonna be close. Real close.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               ALABAMA HIGHWAY - DAY

               as Bandit I and II come rolling down the mountain. Onto the 
               main highway. Over this from the radio, Doug Kershaw plays a 
               mean fiddle.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               A little later. Bandit and Kate talking.

                                     KATE
                              (more relaxed)
                         -- Actually, my heaviest relationship 
                         was with a rock singer named Ramblin' 
                         Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty-
                         one, I went to Europe with visions 
                         of being free and independent. My 
                         luck, he was on the plane. I landed 
                         in Paris and fell in love before I 
                         could claim my baggage.
                              (a beat)
                         We were together for almost a year. 
                         I thought he was it.

                                     BANDIT
                         And?

                                     KATE
                         He wasn't. One day I came home and 
                         found him taking a shower -- with 
                         another girl. And her sister.

               Bandit whistles.

                                     KATE
                         My very words.

                                     BANDIT
                         Well, that's what you get for falling 
                         in love with a guy who's first name 
                         is Ramblin'.

               Kate laughs, then:

               Bandit I roars up behind a long line of cars and campers, 
               crawling along at the prescribed 65.

               INSIDE BANDIT

               Bandit looking ahead. Trying to figure something out.

                                     KATE
                         They should arrest people for obeying 
                         the speed limit.

                         Let's boogie.

               HIGHWAY - DAY

               Bandit pulls into the oncoming lane and roars past half a 
               dozen cars and campers, before sliding back in. A beat and 
               he's off again.

               BANDIT I - MOVING

               as Bandit I pulls out, the VW in front of him pulls out too, 
               forcing Bandit I to swerve around him and onto the shoulder. 
               Bandit floors it, roars along the shoulder and around the 
               VW.

               Bandit I continues passing cars, until he's forced back into 
               the correct lane by an oncoming yellow school bus.

               INSIDE BANDIT

               Bandit flicks the CB selector over two channels.

                                     BANDIT
                         All right, Kate. You clock it and 
                         let Cledus know when this school bus 
                         goes through.

               Kate fires up the mike. The school bus comes closer.

                                     KATE
                              (into mike)

                         You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.

               The school bus passes.

                              (into mike)
                         A yellow school bus just flew past 
                         us. I'll count up to closing time -- 
                         starting... Now. 27, 28, 29, 30, 
                         31...

               Kate keeps her eyes on the road ahead.

               THE HIGHWAY

               Bandit I rolling down the highway. Kate counting OVER:

                                     KATE (V.O.)
                         ...40, 41, 42, 43, 44...

               INSIDE BANDIT I - KATE'S VIEW

               as she continues counting.

                         ...45, 46, 47...

               A black Porsche rounds the curve in the oncoming lane.

               INSIDE BANDIT II - MOVING

               Cledus speeding down the oncoming lane. Both hands gripping 
               the wheel.

                                     KATE
                              (over CB)
                         ...48... 49... Here comes a black 
                         Porsche. Pull in.

               Cledus looks for a place to squeeze in. The traffic is bumper-
               to-bumper. He stomps on it.

               HIGHWAY - DAY

               Bandit II racing down the oncoming lane looking for an 
               opening. And here comes the black Porsche. Straight at him. 
               Finally, Cledus spots an opening and wheels the big rig in -- 
               an instant before the black Porsche whizzes by.

               INSIDE BANDIT II

               Cledus sighs relief. Then:

                                     KATE
                              (over CB)
                         Here we go again, Bandit II.

               Cledus puts the hammer to the floor.

               HIGHWAY - DAY

               as the big eighteen-wheeler pulls back into the oncoming 
               lane and takes off. Camera eases back to:

               AN AERIAL VIEW

               of the Alabama Highway. Bumper-to-bumper traffic in one lane. 
               Bandit I followed in the distance by Bandit II blasting down 
               the oncoming lane doing at least 100 MPH.

               Again Doug Kershaw plays OVER...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               SHERIFF CLAYTON'S CAR - MOVING - DAY

               now almost a complete wreck. The inside of the car is soaking 
               wet, as is the Texas Sheriff. No time to get a new front 
               door.

               Clayton is having trouble seeing through the shattered 
               windshield and runs right over a boulder that's fallen onto 
               the highway... leaving his complete exhaust system laying in 
               the middle of the highway. And now, the ROAR from his engine 
               is deafening.

               NEW ANGLE

               as the battered-up Texas Sheriff's car comes wailing through 
               the mountains and descends to meet:

               THE TRAFFIC JAM

               backed up for miles. Clayton pulls up behind the endless 
               line of cars and campers Bandit I and Bandit II long ago 
               passed.

                                     CLAYTON
                              (leaning on horn)
                         Goddammit. I'm in a goddam hurry, 
                         goddammit!!!

               Clayton continues slamming down on his horn, but no one 
               budges. Resigned, he removes his hand from the horn. But the 
               horn keeps blaring. Stuck.

               As the car horn and engine continue blasting, we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ALABAMA HIGHWAY - AFTERNOON

               Bandit I and II moving down the bullet lane. Deadheading 
               home. Over:

                                     KATE (V.O.)
                         -- It's hard to believe this schmuck 
                         Kyle would go to such lengths for 
                         Coors beer.

                                     BANDIT (V.O.)
                         It's not the beer. He just wants to 
                         see me fail.

                                     KATE (V.O.)
                         What kind of a guy is he?

                         The minute you see him, you'll know.

               Doug Kershaw plays again, and we:

                         five miles outside of Georgia. Heading 
                         in on Eighty-five and looking for a

               Tacky. Colored candles and incense burning. Stained glass

               Sitting at a bar in the front of the trailer, sipping Old 
               Grandad, is FIRST MADAME. Platinum hair and a see-through 
               negligee. She's talking into a CB mike.

               Behind her, in silhouette, ANOTHER WOMAN in a negligee is 
               undressing TWO MEN in uniform. As she removes their hats, 
               ties, belts, shirts...

                         for you. You know, a little 
                         personalized roadside service.

               THE HIGHWAY (DIALOGUE OVERLAPS)

               A PINK MOBILE HOME sits back from the highway, sporting a 
               very long CB antenna. Two signs rest in the front window: 
               "Truckers Only" and "Love Gas For Sale."

               Parked in front of the trailer, are TWO ALABAMA STATE TROOPER 
               CARS.

               As Bandit I whips past:

                         Send me the bill, First Madame.

                         Maybe I'll catch you on the flip-
                         flop. Over and out.

               INSIDE BANDIT I

               Kate turns to him. Shakes her head.

                         Believe me, she's got a heart of 
                         gold.

               reading: Georgia -- 20 Miles. A blur passes camera. Bandit 
               I. Then a much longer blur. Bandit II.

               INSIDE BANDIT I - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON

               Kate and Bandit.

                                     KATE
                         What are you gonna do when you get

                              (then)
                         Wanna join me?

               A beat, she leans across the seat and kisses him. 
               Passionately. He goes with it.

               THE HIGHWAY - HIGH SHOT - AFTERNOON

               As they kiss, the Cobra veers off the highway -- out of 
               control. It swerves back onto the highway, across the oncoming 
               lane, then back toward the shoulder. As Bandit I weaves wildly 
               down the highway, it passes:

               AN ALABAMA STATE TROOPER'S CAR

               The TWO TROOPERS inside exchange a quick look, hit their 
               siren and take off.

               INSIDE BANDIT I

               Kate and Bandit break the kiss when they hear the siren. 
               Bandit glances up in the rear view mirror.

                                     BANDIT
                         Thanks, Kate.

               The Alabama State Trooper chasing Bandit I.

               INSIDE BANDIT

               Bandit spots a SIX TRUCK CONVOY moving up ahead. The rear 
               truck is hauling gasoline. There are several cars between 
               Bandit and the Convoy.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, 
                         coming up on a portable gas station. 
                         Do you copy?

                                     VOICE
                              (from CB)
                         Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm 
                         gearjamming this rolling refinery. 
                         You got another Smokey on the rubber?

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         What else?
                              (then)
                         Can you give me cover, Mister B?

                                     MISTER B
                              (from CB)
                         Come head on, Bandit. We'll slip you 
                         into the rocking chair.

               Bandit looks up in the rear view.

               HIS VIEW - THROUGH REAR VIEW MIRROR

               The Alabama State Trooper is weaving in and out of traffic -- 
               after Bandit. Blue lights swirling.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Bandit floorboards it, passing THREE CARS and sliding back 
               into traffic, an instant before oncoming traffic whizzes by.

               A beat and he's back into the oncoming lane. Passing another 
               FOUR CARS and heading toward the Six Truck Convoy.

               BEHIND HIM

               The Alabama State Trooper passes the First Three Cars and 
               darts back into line, as Bandit comes back out.

               ANGLE - THE HIGHWAY

               Bandit I roars up to the Convoy, the Six Trucks break ranks, 
               leaving an opening in the middle.

               Bandit I passes the first Three Trucks and slips into the 
               Convoy. The Trucks all close ranks around Bandit I.

               ALABAMA STATE TROOPER'S CAR - MOVING

               as it comes up to the back door of the Convoy. The Trooper 
               passes Trucks Six and Five, but Truck Four pulls out of the 
               Convoy, as if to pass, just in front of the Alabama State 
               Trooper.

               The Trooper's car is forced off the highway, onto the 
               shoulder. He floors it, passing the Convoy -- unaware that 
               Truck Four has just hidden Bandit.

               As the Trooper barrels down the highway, Truck Four pulls 
               back into the Convoy.

               INSIDE BANDIT I - MOVING

               Bandit pulls out of the Convoy, passing the Three Lead Trucks.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         Mister B, I don't know how to thank 
                         you.

                                     MISTER B
                              (from CB)
                         Thank me by not getting caught.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE BANDIT II - MOVING - AFTERNOON

               Cledus has the hammer down. Drinking coffee.

                                     BANDIT
                              (from CB)
                         Bandit II?

               Cledus picks up his mike.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (into mike)
                         I'm all ears.

                                     BANDIT
                              (from CB)
                         You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten 
                         up your rubber band. The oncoming's 
                         clear.

               HIGHWAY - AFTERNOON

               as the big eighteen-wheeler takes the oncoming lane and lets 
               her roll. As he roars past the Convoy, he gives a long BLAST 
               on his HORN to each of the trucks as he passes. Each truck 
               responds with a BLAST.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE GEORGIA STATE LINE - LATE AFTERNOON

               The Alabama State Trooper who chased Bandit is parked off 
               the highway at the Alabama/Georgia State Line.

               The Trooper climbs out of his car, to stretch his legs. He 
               unhooks his pistol, sits on the fender of his car. Waits.

               A beat and he hears a HORN honking way off in the distance. 
               He looks up to his left.

               WHAT HE SEES

               Bandit I zooming across the state line on a high road, above 
               the highway. A hand waves to the Trooper from the Cobra.

               BACK TO SCENE

               The Trooper is furious. But before he can do anything, he's 
               practically blown off his fender by a huge eighteen-wheeler 
               blasting across the state line. Bandit II. Heading home.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               GEORGIA COUNTRYSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON

               Bandit I roars through the lush Georgia mountains and heads 
               back toward two lane blacktop.

               He hits the highway, just ahead of Bandit II. And they're 
               off.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               GEORGIA EXPRESSWAY - LATE AFTERNOON

               Bandit I and Bandit II fly past a sign announcing: The Peach 
               Tree Classic.

                                     CLEDUS (V.O.)
                         Hot Lanta, here we come!

               And we:

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               A GEORGIA STATE WEIGHT STATION - LATE AFTERNOON

               Two GEORGIA HIGHWAY PATROL CARS are parked at the Weight 
               Station. Several TRUCKS move across the scales, down the 
               ramp and back onto the highway.

               CAMERA PANS BACK

               to Bandit I coming down the highway toward the Weight Station.

               INSIDE BANDIT

               Bandit sees the scales, slows and pulls off to the side of 
               the road. He lets his motor idle, waiting for Cledus.

                                     KATE
                         Why are you stopping?

                                     BANDIT
                         Weight Station.

               He clicks over the crystal selector another two notches and 
               keys the mike.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         Bandit II?

                                     CLEDUS
                              (over CB)
                         I'm here.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         You're coming up to the scale house.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (over CB)
                         I'm cucumber cool.

               And Bandit II rolls past them, heading up the ramp toward 
               the Weight Station.

               INSIDE BANDIT II

               Cledus waits, as an eighteen-wheeler, hauling mobile homes, 
               rolls onto the scales.

               Cledus glances over to the:

               THE WEIGHT STATION SHACK - CLEDUS' VIEW

               TWO WEIGHT STATION WORKERS are inside. One is checking the 
               scales, the other is rapping with TWO GEORGIA HIGHWAY 
               PATROLMEN.

               BACK TO SCENE

               as the eighteen-wheeler is weighed. Then:

                                     WEIGHT STATION WORKER
                              (over loudspeaker)
                         Okay, you're clear to roll.

               The Driver moves off the scales, back onto the highway. Cledus 
               eases Bandit II into first and moves onto the scales.

               CLOSE - CLEDUS

               waiting. Takes off his gloves. Wipes his hands on his vest. 
               A little nervous. He glances up at the Station house.

               HIS VIEW

               The Weight Station Worker is talking to the Georgia heat. 
               The Worker then moves to the loudspeaker.

                                     WEIGHT STATION WORKER
                              (over loudspeaker)
                         Pull 'er ahead and park.

               NEW ANGLE

               as Cledus leans across Fred and rolls down the window.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (yelling through window)
                         What's the problem?

               The other WORKER starts out of the shack, followed by one of 
               the Georgia Highway Patrolmen.

                                     WEIGHT STATION WORKER
                              (over loudspeaker)
                         Just pull it over, please. And have 
                         your manifest ready.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (under his breath)
                         Oh, Jesus...

               Cledus pulls the big eighteen-wheeler off the scales and 
               into the inspection area.

               The other Weight Station Worker and the Georgia Cop approach 
               the truck. Cledus hands them his manifest. The Weight Station 
               Worker checks it out. The Highway Patrolman looks over his 
               shoulder.

                                     WEIGHT STATION WORKER
                         Paint, huh?

                                     CLEDUS
                         Yep.

                                     WEIGHT STATION WORKER
                         Paint ain't usually pulled 
                         independently.

                                     CLEDUS
                         Hey, I'm a truckin' whore. They got 
                         the money, honey; I got the time.

               The Weight Station Worker laughs. The Highway Patrolman 
               doesn't.

                                     HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                         Wanna open her up?

                                     CLEDUS
                         C'mon fella, this paint's due in 
                         Savannah yesterday.

                                     HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                         Word is some joker's running blocker 
                         for an illegal load. We're just spot 
                         checking.

               Cledus notices the Weight Station Worker's name tag.

                                     CLEDUS
                         C'mon, Ebersol... I've been through 
                         this chicken coop a hundred times...

               But the Weight Station Worker and the Georgia Highway 
               Patrolman have already started toward the rear of Bandit II. 
               The Weight Station Worker jumps up to unlatch Bandit II's 
               back doors.

                                     HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                              (to Cledus)
                         We're just gonna take a quick peek-
                         see. You'll be outta here in no...

               Before he can finish his sentence, the sound of SCREECHING 
               TIRES whips his head around.

               NEW ANGLE - WHAT HE SEES

               Bandit I laying rubber all the way up the ramp, heading 
               straight toward him.

               FULL SHOT

               The Highway Patrolman and the Weight Station Worker dive for 
               cover, as Bandit I blasts past them, doing at least 90.

               Bandit whips the wheel to the right and the Shelby Cobra 
               roars around the Weight Station Shack on two wheels -- tires 
               screaming.

               The Weight Station Worker and Georgia Highway Patrolman rush 
               back toward the Shack, completely forgetting Cledus.

               ANGLE - BANDIT II

               Cledus casually eases the rig into first and rolls out of 
               the parking area, onto the highway.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Nobody notices Cledus drive off, as Bandit I continues 
               screaming around the Weight Station -- tires smoking.

               BANDIT I - RACING ANGLE

               Bandit sees Cledus has safely returned to the highway and 
               whips around the Weight Station Shack for the final time and 
               hits the highway on ramp doing 100.

               ANGLE - THE WEIGHT STATION

               The Two Georgia Highway Patrolmen race toward their cars, 
               leap and take off after Bandit I -- lights and sirens blaring.

               THE HIGHWAY - LATE AFTERNOON

               Bandit I roars past Bandit II, the Two Highway Patrol Cars 
               in hot pursuit.

               The Two Georgia Highway Patrol cars race past Bandit II. 
               Cledus gives them a small wave. They don't notice.

               BANDIT I - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON

               as the Cobra comes racing up to the rear of a long line of 
               slowmoving traffic. Bandit moves out to pass and sees:

               PICKUP TRUCK

               coming straight at him.

               BANDIT I

               swerves onto the shoulder.

               THE PICKUP TRUCK

               does the same.

               BANDIT I AND THE PICKUP TRUCK

               Bandit I swerves back onto the highway. So does the Pickup. 
               And it looks like a head-on for sure.

               At the last instant, Bandit swerves back onto the shoulder. 
               The Pickup rips past him and Bandit manages to pull the Cobra 
               back onto the highway and into the free lane.

               NEW ANGLE

               as the Pickup Truck now is face-to-face with the First Georgia 
               Highway Patrol car. They jockey for position. The First 
               Highway Patrol car swerves and passes the Pickup, but the 
               Second one hits the shoulder barely avoiding a head-on.

               ANGLE - THE SECOND HIGHWAY PATROL CAR

               as it flies over the ditch and does a complete midair end-
               over-end flip -- landing in a ditch. Out of the chase.

               THE EXPRESSWAY OVERPASS - LATE AFTERNOON

               Bandit I races toward the overpass, the Georgia Highway Patrol 
               car three hundred yards behind.

               Bandit I takes the hairpin turn full out and goes into a 
               four wheel drift. Bandit manages to maintain control and 
               punches it in mid-slide, blasting the Cobra through the turn, 
               onto the Expressway below.

               CAMERA HOLDS

               as the Highway Patrol car tries the same feat, loses control 
               and crashes into the chain link divider.

               THE EXPRESSWAY - FROM ABOVE

               Bandit roars onto the Expressway, sailing right past A GEORGIA 
               STATE TROOPER'S CAR, parked on the shoulder, waiting for 
               speeders.

               The State Trooper fires up his engine and with red lights 
               twirling and siren wailing, pulls out after Bandit I.

               Just as he does, the Georgia Highway Patrol car comes racing 
               by and they slam into each other -- knocking both cars twenty 
               feet each way.

               Both cars straighten out and wait for the other to take the 
               lead. The Trooper starts off. So does the Highway Patrol 
               car. The Trooper stops, so does the Highway Patrol car. This 
               goes on for several beats until they both start off at the 
               same time -- and smash right into each other again.

               HIGH SHOT - THE EXPRESSWAY

               as Bandit I races down the Expressway, the Two Police cars 
               finally get it together and take off after him.

               INSIDE BANDIT

               Bandit weaves in and out of traffic. Glances out his side 
               mirror.

               ANGLE - THROUGH SIDE MIRROR

               The Georgia Highway Patrol car and the Georgia State Trooper 
               racing down the Expressway, cars pulling onto the shoulder 
               so they can pass.

               ANGLE - EXPRESSWAY ON RAMP

               A large red sign reads: WRONG WAY - DO NOT ENTER. Bandit I 
               blasts by the sign and enters the on ramp. Going the wrong 
               way!

               INSIDE BANDIT

               Bandit hugging the shoulder. Kate hugging the seat. Petrified.

               THEIR VIEW

               ANOTHER HIGHWAY PATROL CAR is coming down the ramp -- headed 
               straight for them.

               FULL SHOT

               The Highway Patrol car isn't giving ground, as Bandit I roars 
               toward him.

                                     KATE
                         Oh, dear God in heaven!

               THE TWO CARS

               racing toward each other. Neither giving ground. A dead-on 
               Chickie Run.

               Finally, at the last possible instant, the Highway Patrol 
               car swerves to the right, crashing through the guard railing 
               and sailing into:

               MIDAIR

               The Highway Patrol car flies through the air and crashes 
               down on the back of a moving FLATBED TRACTOR TRAILER.

               The Flatbed Truck just keeps driving. Not even noticing.

               THE EXPRESSWAY - RACING ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON

               Bandit I, still going the wrong way. Up ahead -- an Expressway 
               full of cars -- headed straight for Bandit I.

               Bandit floorboards it, flies over the center divider and 
               ends up on the other side of the Expressway, just ahead of 
               Bandit II.

               INSIDE BANDIT I - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON

               as they race down the Expressway, flying past another 
               billboard announcing: The Peach Tree Classic.

               Bandit wipes his brow.

                                     BANDIT
                         What'll we do for excitement on our 
                         second date?

               Before she can answer, from the CB:

                                     CLEDUS
                              (over CB)
                         Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest 
                         congratulations and a piece of advice.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         What's that, pardner?

                                     CLEDUS
                              (over CB)
                         Don't take that foot off the hammer, 
                         'cause you got wall-to-wall Bears 
                         about to pour over you like maple 
                         syrup.

               Bandit looks up in his rear view mirror.

               WHAT HE SEES

               Behind him, FIVE NEW GEORGIA HIGHWAY PATROL CARS, coming on 
               strong.

               FULL SHOT - THE EXPRESSWAY

               as the Five Highway Patrol cars hit their sirens and wail 
               past Bandit II, on their way after Bandit I.

               Bandit I quickly veers off the Expressway onto a crossing 
               highway. The Police cars all follow.

               And Bandit II, continues whipping down the Expressway. Atlanta 
               bound.

               INSIDE BANDIT I - MOVING

               as he flips the CB channel over to 19.

                              (to Kate)
                         I think it's time to call a mayday.

                         Breaker. Breaker. This is Bandit to 
                         Hot Pants. Come back.

               A beat.

                                     HOT PANTS
                              (over CB)
                         Why should I?

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         Because I need your help, sweet thing.
                              (glancing back, the 
                              five Smokeys gaining 
                              ground)
                         And I need it bad.

               INTERCUT - A DRIVE-IN RESTAURANT

               A teenage hangout. Really hopping. Country and Western MUSIC 
               blaring from the radios of Pickup Trucks, VW Vans, Sports 
               Cars, etc, all parked in front of the restaurant. Almost 
               every vehicle sports a CB antenna.

               CAMERA FINDS a beautiful WAITRESS, holding a CB mike, 
               stretched out of a Customized MODEL A. Inside the Model A, 
               the Driver is eating a hamburger. The beautiful Waitress is 
               HOT PANTS.

                                     HOT PANTS
                              (into mike)
                         I'm working, Bandit. Besides, what's 
                         the matter? Won't your new girl friend 
                         help you?

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         Hot Pants, please. I'm gonna be flying 
                         by in about five minutes with Smokey 
                         on my tail. Can you lock it off behind 
                         me?

               No answer.

                                     BANDIT

                         Yes.

                              (into mike)
                         I'm begging.

                         I want you to know I'm doing this 
                         against my better instincts.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         But you'll do it?

                         I'll do it.

                         I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.

                         You sure do.

               Bandit hangs up the mike and turns to Kate.

                                     BANDIT
                              (before she can say 
                              anything)
                         Yes, I actually dated a woman who 
                         still wears hot pants.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE EXPRESSWAY - LATE AFTERNOON

               Bandit I whizzes past camera. Wait. Then here comes the 
               Highway Patrol. They've picked up reinforcements. Ten in 
               all.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE HIGHWAY - IN FRONT OF THE DRIVE-IN - LATE AFTERNOON

               Hot Pants has gathered all the cars from the drive-in and 
               lined them up along both shoulders of the highway. Some are 
               facing east. Some west. The drivers all wait in complete 
               silence.

               Finally, in the distance, the sound of sirens. Coming closer.

               LOW ANGLE - THE HIGHWAY

               as a speck rises over a hill and comes barrelling down the 
               center divider, doing at least 120. A beat and a dozen more 
               specks top the hill and roar down the highway in pursuit.

               The specks quickly take form. Bandit I followed by a dozen 
               Georgia Highway Patrol cars. The vehicles parked along the 
               shoulder all fire up their engines on cue. And wait.

               NEW ANGLE

               Bandit I roars past the cars parked along the shoulder.

               The instant Bandit I clears, the vehicles pull off the 
               shoulder and begin moving down the highway -- eastbound and 
               westbound -- all doing a conservative law-abiding 55.

               THE HIGHWAY PATROL CARS

               come roaring down the eastbound lane and find the road totally 
               blocked by teen-age traffic going both ways. They're stuck. 
               Even the shoulders are blocked by cars from the drive-in. 
               Just in case.

               And as Bandit I disappears around a distant curve:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXPRESSWAY ON RAMP - LATE AFTERNOON

               Camera follows Bandit I as it shoots down the highway and 
               back onto the Expressway, just ahead of Bandit II.

               INTERCUT - INSIDE BANDIT I AND II

               Everyone breathes a sigh. Bandit clicks over the CB.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         How's the clock, Bandit II.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (into mike)
                         Ticking away, but it looks like a 
                         clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights 
                         and white lines all the way.

               Kate turns the rear view mirror towards her and straightens 
               her hair. Bandit glances over.

                                     KATE
                         Hey, this could be the biggest house 
                         I ever played to.

               Bandit smiles as both he and Cledus trounce on their pedals.

               As Bandit I and II take off, Atlanta bound, we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TWO GEORGIA STATE POLICE CHOPPERS

               flving high over the highways leading into Atlanta. Over 
               this:

                                     CHOPPER PILOT'S VOICE
                         Paydirt!

               AERIAL VIEW

               from the chopper. Bandit I and Bandit II blazing a trail 
               toward Atlanta.

               THE CHOPPERS

               as they swoop down toward camera.

                                     CHOPPER PILOT'S VOICE
                         -- We just picked up the Cobra 
                         eastbound on Interstate 72 heading 
                         for the Peach Tree Classic. Over.

                                     COMMANDER'S VOICE
                         All units converge.

               And now:

               A BIRD'S EYE VIEW

               of the Atlanta Expressway arteries. Every type of law 
               enforcement vehicle in the area -- STATE TROOPERS, LOCAL 
               POLICE, HIGHWAY PATROLMEN, the works -- are blowing down the 
               Expressway. Blue, Red and Yellow lights swirling.

               CAMERA SWOOPS IN

               closer and picks up Bandit I and II. Driving like crazy. 
               Leading the pack.

               The Peach Tree Classic Track looms ahead.

               CLOSER STILL - MOVING

               as TWENTY-SEVEN POLICE CARS converge behind Bandit I and II, 
               forming an endless line of flashing lights.

               As the Two Bears in the sky fly in low over the Convoy, we 
               go:

               INSIDE BANDIT I - MOVING

               The sounds of SIRENS and the WHOOSH of choppers is deafening.

                                     BANDIT
                         Talk about being popular...

               Then he looks up ahead. And is speechless.

               WHAT HE SEES - THE ENTRANCE TO THE FAIRGROUNDS

               Under a huge billboard announcing "The Peach Tree Classic" -- 
               is a greeting party. TEN COP CARS block the entrance gate to 
               the raceway. Twenty cops form a line in front of their 
               vehicles. TV cameras are poised.

               BACK TO SCENE

               as Bandit fires up the CB.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         I hate to say it, man; but I think 
                         it's over. Time to lay down our hand.

               INSIDE BANDIT II - MOVING

               Fred is now on all four in the front seat. Tail slapping 
               back and forth. Barking like crazy.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (into mike)
                         Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come 
                         this far.

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         Yeah, but...

                                     CLEDUS
                              (into mike)
                         When we agree to do a job, we do it. 
                         Right?

                                     BANDIT
                              (into mike)
                         But they're waiting for me. They 
                         don't even know Cledus Snow exists.

                                     CLEDUS
                              (into mike)
                         Well, they're gonna. It's time this 
                         gearjammer rode to glory.
                              (then)
                         Now, move aside; good buddy. I'm 
                         coming through.

               And Cledus puts it to the floor.

               NEW ANGLE

               as the huge eighteen-wheeler takes the bullet lane and passes 
               Bandit I, almost blowing off its doors.

               THE CONVOY - MOVING

               led by Cledus in Bandit II. Roaring toward the race track 
               gate. Hammer down. Stacks open. Horn blaring. Bandit I right 
               on his tail.

               And behind them, twenty-seven bubble gum machines lighting 
               up the Georgia countryside.

               FAIRGROUNDS ENTRANCE GATE

               The COPS see Bandit II -- eighteen-wheels of terror -- roaring 
               down the hill and headed full steam toward them.

               ANGLE - THE COPS

               Some run to their cars as fast as they can, start 'em up and 
               scatter. Others just run as fast as they can, period. Utter 
               chaos!

               BANDIT II - RACING ANGLE

               as it comes barrelling toward the entrance gate, cutting 
               right through the remaining Police cars -- sending them 
               reeling.

               Then the big rig blasts through the entrance gate, demolishing 
               it and sending timber flying sky high.

               NEW ANGLE

               Bandit II heads for the race track smoke stacks blasting.

               A beat and Bandit I, followed by half of Atlanta's Smokeys, 
               comes roaring through what's left of the entrance gate.

               IN THE STANDS

               The "Peach Tree Classic" is in progress. Stock Cars racing 
               full speed around the track. But the CROWD'S attention is 
               turned toward the entrance gate.

               ANGLE - KYLE BRAND AND HIS SON DICKEY

               sitting in a front row box. Kyle has binoculars up to his 
               eyes.

               ANGLE - THRU BINOCULARS

               Bandit I and II roaring straight toward the stands.

               BACK TO KYLE AND DICKEY

               Kyle lowers his binoculars and turns to his son.

                                     KYLE
                         That crazy sumbitch made it.

                                     DICKEY
                         Congratulations. You just became a 
                         legend maker.

               FULL SHOT - THE TRACK

               Stock cars whipping around the curves, as Bandit I and Bandit 
               II cut a path across the infield and roar onto the track -- 
               screeching to a halt directly in front of Kyle's box.

               BEHIND THEM

               The Stock Cars swerve, slide and sail onto the infield -- 
               trying to avoid collisions.

               The Convoy of Police Cars, their sirens blasting and their 
               advertising still swirling, are forced to stop -- as the 
               Stock Cars pile up in front of them. Flags go down. The race 
               is abruptly halted. A helicopter still hovers low overhead.

               ANGLE - THE STANDS

               The doors of Bandit I and II fly open and Bandit, Kate and 
               Cledus all pile out and head for Kyle's box.

               CLOSER ANGLE - THE BOX

               All eyes are on Bandit, Cledus, Kate, Kyle and Dickey.

                                     KYLE
                              (trying to act casual)
                         You got my barley pop?

                                     BANDIT
                         What do you think?

                                     DICKEY
                              (toothy smile)
                         Have any trouble getting here?

                                     BANDIT
                         About one to five years worth.

                                     KATE
                              (turning to Bandit, 
                              stunned)
                         One to five?

                                     BANDIT
                              (hopefully)
                         Maybe six months with good behavior.
                              (resigned)
                         One to five.

                                     KYLE
                              (coughs, then)
                         Well, I guess I gotta hand it to 
                         you.

               He reaches into his pocket and brings out a shiny new set of 
               keys. He then gestures toward the sidelines. They all turn.

               WHAT THEY SEE

               The late afternoon sun sparkles off the chrome smokestacks 
               of a brand-new KENWORTH EIGHTEEN-WHEELER.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Kyle hands Bandit the keys.

               Behind them, the POLICE have all jumped out of their cars -- 
               (which now, along with the stock cars, cover the entire 
               infield -- ) and are rushing toward Bandit and Cledus.

                                     DICKEY
                              (toothy grin)
                         I wonder if they'll let you take a K-
                         Whooper to prison?

                                     CLEDUS
                              (to Kyle)
                         Mind if I cream your son?

                                     KYLE
                              (to Bandit)
                         Don't sweat it. I'll have y'all out 
                         on bail in no time. Fools like you 
                         are valuable.

               NEW ANGLE - TRACKING - ACROSS THE TRACK

               as Bandit, Kate and Cledus start across, toward the oncoming 
               rush of police.

               As they walk:

                                     BANDIT
                              (to Kate)
                         Well, at least it hasn't been boring.

                                     KATE
                         Well, thanks for the lift.

                                     BANDIT
                              (it was nothing)
                         Hey...

               There's a long pause. The cops are now closing in. Cledus 
               walks toward them -- arms outstretched.

                                     BANDIT
                              (after an uneasy beat)
                         What can I say?

                                     KATE
                         Promise me you won't fall in love 
                         with an inmate.

               He grins. The cops are on top of them. Handcuffs on Bandit. 
               Kate moves forward, pushing the cops out of the way. And 
               kisses Bandit.

               THE STANDS

               as five thousand people cheer.

               NEW ANGLE

               Suddenly, a deafening ROAR is heard O.S. and all heads turn 
               to see:

               SHERIFF CLAYTON'S CAR

               storming through the gate and across the infield. The Texas 
               Highway Patrol car is almost a complete wreck. So is the 
               driver.

               The car comes to a skidding halt and Sheriff Buell Clayton 
               leaps out. He heads straight toward Bandit -- fists clenched.

                                     CLAYTON
                              (screaming)
                         Get your hands off my daughter!

                                     BANDIT
                         Your what?

               Clayton takes about five more frenzied steps, then suddenly 
               drops to the ground. And faints. Out cold.

               Everybody rushes forward, thinking the poor son-of-a-bitch 
               is dead.

                                     KATE
                              (to Bandit)
                         He's just exhausted.

                                     BANDIT
                         That man is your father?!?

               She nods. Then:

                                     KATE
                         I should've told you, but you would've 
                         thrown me out, right?

                                     BANDIT
                         Absolutely.

                                     KATE
                              (speeding)
                         Listen, he's nuts. I mean certifiable. 
                         But believe it or not, he once looked 
                         great in Levis. That's why my mother 
                         married him. But like all good 
                         things...
                              (then)
                         I know what you're thinking.

               Bandit says nothing.

                                     KATE
                         What are you thinking?

                                     BANDIT
                              (looking over at 
                              Clayton, still out 
                              cold)
                         You gotta admire the man's 
                         determination.

               She hugs him. A beat and the cops push Bandit and Cledus 
               into the back seat of the lead squad car.

               As Two Cops move around the front, Kate leans in the rear 
               window.

               INSIDE THE SQUAD CAR

               Bandit and Cledus. Handcuffed.

                                     KATE
                              (to the guys)
                         Well, was it worth it?

               Bandit and Cledus look at each other. Then nod. Then laugh. 
               Kate laughs with them.

               Then the Two Cops hop in the front seat, as the other Twenty-
               Six Smokey's head for their cars.

                                     KATE
                              (to Cledus)
                         I'll take care of Fred.

               And now it's almost over. The Cop starts up the engine. Kate 
               and Bandit look at each other for a long moment.

                                     KATE
                         See ya, Bandit.

                                     BANDIT
                         See ya, Kate.

               Kate backs away from the window, as the squad car pulls out, 
               followed by the endless line of Atlanta's finest.

               Their sirens now silent. But their advertising still flashing.

               And now, as we pull further and further away, watching the 
               whole event become history...

               We hear:

                                     VOICE ONE
                         -- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana 
                         Peel.

                                     VOICE TWO
                         -- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.

                                     VOICE ONE
                         -- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?

                                     VOICE TWO
                         -- Yeah, I heard. But they won't 
                         hold him for long. Anyway, he sure 
                         gave them sumbitches a run for their 
                         money.

               And:

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
