The Law Enforcement Technology Advancement Centre (LETAC) has developed SID version 6.7: a Sadistic, Intelligent, and Dangerous virtual reality entity which is synthesized from the personalities of more than 150 serial killers.
LETAC would like to train police officers by putting them in VR with SID, but they must prove the concept by using prisoners as test subjects.
One such prisoner is ex-cop Parker Barnes.
When SID manages to inject his personality into a nano-machine android, it appears that Barnes might be the only one who can stop him.
