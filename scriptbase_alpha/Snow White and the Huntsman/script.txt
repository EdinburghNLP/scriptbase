          1 EXT. GARDENS/ CASTLE - DAY. 1

          From high above we see the castle gardens covered in a blanket
          of snow. We hear the tread of footsteps then see a beautiful
          WOMAN in a fur-lined cloak heading towards an unseen object.

          ERIC (V.0.)
          Once upon a time, in deep winter, a Queen
          was admiring the falling snow when she saw
          a rose blooming in defiance of the cold.
          The rose looks miraculously red. Nearby, a RAVEN looks on. The
          Queen gazes at the flower, then bends down.

          ERIC (V.0.)
          Reaching for it, she pricked her finger and
          three drops of blood fell.
          BOOM -- with the impact of an artillery shell, a DROP OF BLOOD
          lands in the snow. Followed by ANOTHER. And ANOTHER.
          The Queen startles, then calmly touches her stomach.

          ERIC (V.0.)
          And because the red seemed so alive against
          the white, she thought, if only I had a
          child as white as snow, lips as red as
          blood, hair as black as a raven's wings and
          all with the strength of that rose.
          A beat, then we hear the piercing cry of a new-born baby --

          2 INT. ROYAL BEDROOM - DAY. 2

          We find ourselves in a crowded chamber full of MIDWIVES and
          PHYSICIANS. Moving through the chaos we glimpse buckets of
          water, dirty sponges, astrology charts and protection charms --
          until we see a BABY GIRL in the arms of her happy mother.

          ERIC (V.O.)
          Soon after, a daughter was born to the
          Queen and was named "Snow White."
          With a radiant smile, the Queen offers SNOW WHITE to her proud
          father, KING MAGNUS. The baby's CRIES grow louder as the King
          cradles her gently in his arms, turning towards a mirror.

          ERIC V/O
          And she was adored throughout the kingdom
          as much for her defiant spirit as for her
          beauty.

          3 EXT. WOODS NEAR CASTLE - DAY. 3

          A wounded MAGPIE is twitching in a puddle of water. SNOW WHITE,
          aged 7 now, steps towards it hesitantly, looking concerned.

                         (CONTINUED)

          YOUNG SNOW WHITE
          Pick it up, William.
          Her companion, William, also 7, braces himself, reaches down,
          then steps back in alarm as the bird starts flapping wildly. He
          tries to cover his embarrassment by sounding knowledgeable.

                         YOUNG WILLIAM
          It's dying. It doesn't want to be touched.
          Snow White ignores him, approaching the bird herself. She kneels
          down, hesitates, then reaches out and strokes the magpie,
          calming its flapping before she picks it up.
          High up on a tree, ANOTHER MAGPIE looks on.

          4 EXT. SEASIDE VILLAGE/ CASTLE BRIDGE - DAY 4

          SNOW WHITE runs, cupping the wounded bird in her hand, William
          dashing after her. The sun is out and the fields and forests are
          lit up in all their glory. The children sprint through a
          BEAUTIFUL SEASIDE VILLAGE -- thatched homes with flower gardens,
          HAPPY FARMERS and FAIR VILLAGE MAIDENS --

          YOUNG SNOW WHITE
          Hurry, William! Hurry!
          They run down the dunes, waves crashing, the sand gleaming in
          the sunlight, until they see the BEAUTIFUL CASTLE up ahead --

          5 EXT. CLOISTER GARDENS/ CASTLE - DAY 5

           A single apple tree stands in the middle of the cloisters. It
           stands out. Snow White and William dash past it into the castle.

                         6 OMITTED 6

          7 INT. ROYAL BEDROOM - DAY. 7

          Snow White bursts into her parent's chamber. The King and Queen
          turn from the window. Two PHYSICIANS are in attendance. Snow
          White is too young and preoccupied to notice but her mother's
          smile is tinged with sadness and her father looks heartbroken.

          YOUNG SNOW WHITE
          We found it in the woods.
          The Queen takes the wounded magpie from Snow White. The King
          looks on sadly as she pulls a RIBBON from Snow White's hair and
          carefully binds the magpie's wing. William watches from the
          doorway, noticing how frail the Queen looks.
          The magpie's flapping gradually calms, its pain easing.

                         QUEEN
          It will heal in time.
          Snow White's eyes are fixed on the little bird.

                         SNOW WHITE
          I'll look after it.
          The King watches Snow White, hiding his sorrow behind a smile.
          So does the Queen, holding back her tears.

                         QUEEN
          You possess a rare beauty, my love. In
          here.
          (She touches Snow white's heart)
          Never lose it. Hold it dear. You will need
          its strength to one day become Queen.

          8 EXT. CLOISTER GARDEN/ CASTLE - DAY. 8

          Snow White and William, with a small toy bow strapped to his
          back, climb the branches of the apple tree in the cloister
          gardens. William picks a DISTINCTIVE RED AND WHITE APPLE and
          offers it to Snow White.
          He makes a point of the offer, holding it out, nodding.
          Just as she comes to take it he pulls it away and takes a
          huge bite himself, grinning. Snow White shoves him off the
          tree and they fall to the ground.
          And now we PULL BACK to reveal the King and William's father,
          DUKE HAMMOND, watching from the throne room balcony.

                         KING MAGNUS
          My daughter will need your son's friendship
          more than ever, Duke Hammond. As will I
          yours.

                         DUKE HAMMOND
          We are here to serve you, your Majesty.
          As the King watches his daughter, ERIC'S VOICEOVER resumes:

          ERIC (V.0)
          The next winter was the harshest in memory
          and Snow White's mother passed away.
          Ba EXT. GARDENS/ CASTLE - DAY. 8a
          The garden is covered in snow but there is no red rose now. King
          Magnus walks with his arm around Snow white, heartbroken.
          A single tear rolls down Snow White's cheek. Palace onlookers
          and mourners, fixed on her face, feeling what she feels, move
          aside.

          ERIC (V.0)
          A year went by but the King was
          inconsolable. Taking advantage of his
          grief, dark forces gathered on the
          kingdom's borders.

          10 EXT. FOREST/ BATTLEFIELD - DAY 10

           From above we see horses movie through the forest and enter a
           clearing. At the head is --
          King Magnus, with Duke Hammond by his side, surrounded by a
          line of the King's Army. They are frozen as they look at--
          Across the battlefield - Horsemen in a line. THE RIDERS are
          silhouetted on a misty plain -- a VAST SHADOW ARMY of faceless
          warriors.
          King Magnus and the Duke trade a look -

                         DUKE HAMMOND
          From what hell comes this army?

                         KING MAGNUS
          A hell they'll soon revisit!
          King Magnus SCREAMS A BLOOD CRY, kicks his horse and rides
          forward with blind courage, no longer caring what happens to
          him.
          The two lines of warriors race, pell-mell to the center of
          the battlefield. When they meet --
          Hand to hand combat at its most brutal.
          King Magnus swings his great sword, and a SHADOW WARRIOR

          SHATTERS LIKE GLASS.
          All down the line the same is happening - Shadow Warriors
          shattering, evaporating.
          Strange.
          DUKE HAMMOND shatters an opponent as well and as loud and
          furious as the battlefield was only moments before, it is now
          that quiet.
          The King and the Duke watch in amazement as the rest of the
          SHADOW ARMY melts away, DISSOLVING INTO THE MORNING MIST until
          all that is left in the field is --

          ERIC (V.0.)
          The unholy army was defeated, leaving
          King Magnus with the spoils of victory.
          A CAGED PRISON WAGON. Odd. Not even sure how it got there.
          King Magnus moves toward it, with a little trepidation. When
          he's close he gets off his horse, walks closer and dares to
          look inside.

                         10 CONTINUED: 10
          Inside the cage, a WOMAN COWERS, her face hidden behind a veil.
          King Magnus stares at her through the prison bars, then with a
          mighty blow of his sword shatters the lock and enters.

                         KING MAGNUS
          You are now free. You have nothing to fear
          from me.
          Duke Hammond watches from outside the cage, a bit wary, as the
          King kneels beside the terrified woman.

                         KING MAGNUS
          What is your name, my lady?
          Slowly, the woman turns. For a moment the King wonders if it's
          his beloved Queen behind the veil. Gently, he lifts her veil.
          It's not his wife, but the most beautiful woman he's ever seen.

                         RAVENNA
          My name is Ravenna, sire.
          The King is speechless now, gazing upon the face of an angel.

          ERIC (V.0.)
          So struck by her beauty was the King, that
          he forgot, for the first time, his broken
          heart.
          His gaze is so intense that Ravenna looks down for a moment.
          When she lifts her head --

                         CUT TO:
          10a INT. GYPSY WAGON - FLASHBACK - DAY. l0a
          YOUNG RAVENNA - her face reflected in a small hand mirror.
          Ravenna as a child, beautiful but poor, looks into the
          mirror. Her MOTHER, a gypsy woman in tattered clothes, moves
          the mirror closer.

                         RAVENNA'S MOTHER
          This - is all that can save you, Ravenna.
          The young Ravenna looks away, distracted by SHOUTS and
          COMMOTION outside.
          10b EXT. GYPSY CAMP - SAME - DAY. 10b
          A little boy, FINN, runs as fast as he can through the snow
          toward the Gypsy Camp.
          Behind him, THE KING'S RIDERS advance on the camp.

          BACK INSIDE THE WAGON
          Ravenna's mother tries to keep her daughter's attention --

           Ravenna!

          11 INT. PREPARATION CHAMBER/ CASTLE - DAY. 11


          CU - RAVENNA'S FACE
          Present day. Still as a statue and even more beautiful as
          cheeks are powdered, eyebrows plucked and lips painted by
          several sets of HANDS. Her eyes stare straight ahead,
          unblinking, her mind elsewhere.
          Attendants are preparing Ravenna for her wedding to the King.

          SNOW WHITE (O.S.)
          You're so beautiful...
          Ravenna snaps to and looks into the face of Snow White,
          reverential, standing a few feet away.
          Ravenna's face softens as she looks at the face of Snow
          White. Ravenna beckons to her with a look and then holds out
          her arm - "Come."
          As Snow White steps forward, the handmaidens withdraw until
          only one is left, weaving beautiful flowers in Ravenna's
          hair.

                         RAVENNA
          That is kind, child. Especially when it is
          said that yours is the face of true beauty
          in this kingdom.
          Snow White doesn't quite know how to answer this.

                         RAVENNA
          (A warm smile)
          Would you like to be dressed up like this
          and married one day?
          Snow White nods.

                         RAVENNA
          I hope you'll invite me?

          YOUNG SNOW WHITE
          Of course.
          Snow White smiles, enchanted by her new friend.

                         RAVENNA
          I know it is difficult, child. When I
          was your age I, too, lost my mother.

                         SNOW WHITE
          You did?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         RAVENNA
          Yes. A King tore me from her arms,
          dressed me in lace and stole my
          innocence.
          Snow White's smile dies a bit; confused.

                         RAVENNA
          I can never take your mother's place, but
          I feel that you and I are bound.
          (touches her heart)
          I feel it here.
          Snow White mimics, touching her own heart, and smiles at
          Ravenna. It should be a touching moment but something in
          Snow White's face - the way her smile lights up the room -
          gives Ravenna pause.

          12 INT. CATHEDRAL - DAY 12

          Ravenna, in a stunning dress,.walks down the center aisle. All
          the NOBLES in the land are present.
          Ravenna looks at them, on either side of the aisle. They are all
          smiling, nodding appreciation. But they aren't really looking
          at Ravenna. She follows their gaze to --
          Snow White, behind, holding the folds of silk from the
          wedding dress. Snow White looks up, adoringly, at Ravenna.
          As the bride and groom reach the altar, KING MAGNUS turns and
          smiles, the happiest man alive.

          13 INT. ROYAL BEDROOM - NIGHT 13

          King Magnus lies on the bed, drunk - half with wine and half
          with lust. His eyes fixed on --
          Ravenna, in a sheer silk nightgown standing near the fireplace,
          holding a goblet. Staring a seductive hole through him.
          She starts slowly toward him, never taking her eyes off him.
          He licks his lips - can't wait for her to arrive.

                         KING MAGNUS
          (Gazing at her lustfully)
          Who are you?

                         RAVENNA
          The bane of Kings.
          When she does arrive she slowly crawls onto the bed, rolls
          him on his back, straddles him and offers the goblet.

                         RAVENNA
          Sup, my lord.
          King Magnus drains the goblet, tosses it and gropes her body.

          Now you are mine.
          Her eyes gleam in the firelight. Magnus tries to playfully
          wrestle her off, but she grabs his hands and holds him down
          firmly.

                         RAVENNA
          I will destroy you.

                         KING MAGNUS

                         (LOVING IT)
          Indeed, you will.
          She rips open his shirt then bends down and kisses him on the
          lips. He can't believe how good she tastes.

                         RAVENNA
          As my people were destroyed. As my family
          was destroyed. As I would have been
          destroyed.
          He is slightly confused by this and his face begins to show
          discomfort.

                         RAVENNA
          But when a woman stays young forever - no
          man can resist her - and the world is hers.
          He suddenly STARTS TO CHOKE, his eyes widening in surprise.
          As he struggles for breath...

                         KING MAGNUS
          What...?

                         RAVENNA
          First I will take your life, my lord. Then
          I will take your throne.
          She reaches beneath the sheets, pulls out an ORNATE DAGGER
          and BRINGS IT DOWN THROUGH HIM --
          13a EXT. OUTSIDE ROYAL BEDROOM 13a
          Several Guards line the hallway. The door opens and Ravenna
          emerges. As she moves past them...

                         RAVENNA
          The King has laid down his sword for the
          night.
          Their eyes take her, lustfully, in as she strides away and
          disappears around a corner.

          Ravenna's mother takes Ravenna's hand and holds it over a
          bowl of white liquid.

                         RAVENNA'S MOTHER
          You must trust me, my love.
          With a small blade she nicks Ravenna's wrist. Three drops of
          blood fall into the white liquid - BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
          Finn, Ravenna's brother blasts through the door.

                         FINN
          They're coming! The King's men!

                         RAVENNA
          Drink!
          Ravenna chokes it down.

                         RAVENNA'S MOTHER
          Drink! And with it the ability to steal
          youth and beauty! For that is your
          ultimate power and only protection.
          Finn steps forward.

                         FINN
          I will protect my sister!
          Ravenna's mother reaches out and touches her son's forehead,
          closes her eyes, an incantation of sorts...

                         FINN
          So it shall be, Finn.

          14 EXT. COURTYARD/CASTLE - PRESENT - NIGHT 14

          Ravenna exits the castle and crosses the courtyard with a
          lantern. A portcullis opens and DARK FIGURES emerge from the
          shadows, entering the castle. Leading them is a tall pale-eyed
          warrior (FINN). He looks at Ravenna devotedly.

                         RAVENNA
          Welcome, brother.

          15 INT. CORRIDORS/ CASTLE - NIGHT. 15

          We see the shadows of the invaders sweeping through the
          corridors, putting the King's sleeping soldiers to the sword.

          Snow White lies asleep when she hears a bell ringing. At first
          she thinks she's dreaming, but then she hears cries of alarm.
          She sits up curiously, then climbs out of bed --

          17 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SNOW WHITE'S ROOM - NIGHT. 17

          There's panic and chaos outside, COURTIERS and SOLDIERS running
          for their lives. Snow White stares in confusion, then runs too -

          18 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ROYAL BEDROOM - NIGHT. 18

          Snow White rushes towards her father's chamber and sees Ravenna
          at the end of the corridor. Relieved, she hurries towards her
          stepmother when suddenly she notices her father's lifeless body
          lying on the bed. FINN and his KNIGHTS appear beside Ravenna. It
          takes a moment for the betrayal to sink in, tears of shock
          welling in Snow White's eyes, before she turns and flees --

          19 EXT. COURTYARD/CASTLE -- NIGHT. 19

          The chaos has spread to the courtyard, DUKE HAMMOND'S KNIGHTS
          struggling to hold back the invaders. Snow White hurries out,
          dazed by the sight of battle, then sees William pull free of his
          father's guards and run towards her --
          William grabs her protectively when strong arms reach down and
          lift them both onto the back of separate horses. Duke Hammond
          and his personal guard are attempting to ride out of the castle
          before the portcullis closes.
          The Duke rides under the portcullis with William. His bodyguard
          is about to follow when an ARROW FROM FINN STRIKES HIM IN THE
          BACK and both he and Snow White are thrown off their horse.

                         YOUNG WILLIAM
          Father! The Princess!
          But the portcullis is down, separating Snow White and William.
          The last thing he sees is Snow White struggling in Finn's arms,
          being hauled back into the castle.

          20 INT. MIRROR CHAMBER - NIGHT 20

          Ravenna walks from statue to painting to urn, toppling and
          tearing them from the walls. Cleaning house. Ravenna's soldiers
          deliver a large object, then leaving her alone. A BEAUTIFUL
          MIRROR rests against the wall. Ravenna stares at it.

                         RAVENNA
          Mirror, mirror, on the wall
          Who is the fairest of them all?
          There'.s a brief silence, then the surface of the mirror ripples.
          LIQUID-spills onto the floor where it reforms into the shape of
          THE MIRROR MAN. His body is a veil of reflective bronze but his
          face-is a distorted version of Ravenna's own.

          your power and beauty?
          Ravenna smiles, moves to the center of the room, raises her arms
          and drunk with power --
          SCREAMS! The scream becomes --

          20a EXT. GYPSY WAGON - FLASHBACK - DAY. 20a
          Young Ravenna's SCREAM as she is ripped from her mother's
          arms. Finn throws himself into the mix but is backhanded to
          the ground. Ravenna's mother moves forward, ready to attack.
          The Guard holding Ravenna pulls a dagger and puts it to
          Ravenna's throat, which stops her mother.
          Ravenna is dragged away and tossed on the back of a horse --

                         RAVENNA'S MOTHER
          But be warned Ravenna: By fairest blood
          it is done and only by fairest blood can
          it be undone.
          Ravenna looks back to see her mother and other gypsies put to
          the sword.
          Finn struggles free and chases after the King's men as they
          gallop away.

          Ravenna stands at the top of the stairs.

          So kind of you all to stay over.

                         GENERAL
          What shall we do with these?
          She eyes the noblemen and guests from left to right. Their
          eyes beg for mercy.
          There is none.

          Ravenna notices Finn, off to one side, his dagger at the neck
          of Snow White, who stares defiantly at Ravenna.

                         RAVENNA
          Finn!
          Finn stops his exit with Snow White, and turns. Ravenna
          stares at the little girl, not sure where she stands with
          this one. And then,...

                         RAVENNA
          Lock her away. One never knows when royal

           HEAR ERIC'S VOICEOVER AGAIN --

           ERIC (V.0.)
          The spell Ravenna's mother placed on her
          gave her the ability to steal youth and
          beauty, and indeed all things good, for
          her own evil purposes. But for every
          life there must be a death, for every
          gain, loss, and under the reign of
          Ravenna nature turned on itself and
          people turned on each other.

          21A INT. CASTLE - NORTH TOWER - NIGHT. 21A


          ERIC V/O
          And all this time, she kept Snow White in
          a cell in the north tower.
          Ravenna, in the shadows, sits perfectly still. Though it's
          been years she looks the same. The object of her gaze is --
          Snow White, who has changed. She is now a woman, lying in a
          darkened cell. Asleep.
          Around the corner, Finn secretly eyes his sister, who doesn't
          notice him.
          Ravenna, just outside the cell, doesn't blink, entranced by
          Snow White. Strange.
          Snow White opens her eyes and sees Ravenna. This is not the
          first time this has happened. Their eyes locked. Then...

                         SNOW WHITE
          Why?...
          Ravenna doesn't answer, just stands and walks away.

          A chill wind whips through the woods. Lying sprawled on the
          ground we see a man (ERIC) who looks like he's dead.

          It's only as we move closer to his rugged face that we see the
          empty FLAGON OF GROG by his side and realize he's drunk. His
          eyes flicker, as a WOMAN'S SCREAM cuts through the woods.

                         FLASH TO:

          THE SPECTRE OF A WOMAN
          SARA, beautiful, in pain. A patch of blood blossoms on her
          dress. Her mouth is open, screaming but no sound comes out.

          BACK TO SCENE - WE HEAR THE SCREAM
          Eric's eyes flicker and begin to open -- then he hears it
          again.

          ROSE (O.S.)
          Help!!!!
          He rises to his feet unsteadily, his head pounding from a
          hangover, then grabs two THROWING HATCHETS and slides them into
          his harness on his back --

          25 EXT. FOREST - DAY. 25

          Eric runs past trees and ducks under branches, crashing into a
          few, still drunk. As he arrives at a clearing he sees a
          beautiful girl, (ROSE), fighting off a HUGE TATTOOED WARRIOR,

          (BROCH).

                         ERIC
          Lay a hand on her and I'll take your head!
          BROCH turns and sees the huntsman with his hatchet raised.

                         BROCH
          Ale given you courage again, huntsman?

                         ERIC
          Won't take much courage to split your skull
          from here.

                         BROCH
          Aye, but first you'd have to see straight.
          Broch advances with a grin, drawing his own axe. Trying to clear
          his vision and steady his aim, Eric hurls the hatchet -- and
          MISSES, the blade sticking in the tree above the frightened
          Greta's head --
          Broch is on Eric in an instant, swinging his huge battle axe.
          Eric narrowly avoids the deadly blows, his natural skill and
          dexterity slowed down by all the ale he's drunk.

                         (CONTINUED)

          Rose looks on, terrified, as Broch drives Eric towards the
          trees. He corners him against an oak and swings his axe -- only
          for Eric to duck at the last moment --
          The blade buries itself deep in the tree, stuck. We realize now
          from Eric's dark smile that he lured Broch into the trap. He
          draws his second hatchet, but instead of using the blade, cracks
          Broch over the head with the handle, knocking him out.
          Rose looks on in admiration as the huntsman goes through Broch's
          pockets.

          Thank you.
          Eric turns. Rose sees how handsome he is. Eric stares at her
          thoughtfully then approaches and gently lifts her chin,
          examining her pretty features. Rose doesn't seem to mind,
          looking back with an inviting smile.

                         ROSE
          I don't know how to repay you?
          Eric stares at her a moment, then suddenly picks her up and
          tosses her over his shoulders.

                         ERIC
          Don't worry, somebody else will.

          And now we see a RICKETY PRISON WAGON full of BEAUTIFUL GIRLS,
          just like Rose, staring out furiously from behind bars. Eric and
          a SLAVE MERCHANT haggle over Rose who is bound and gagged,
          looking just as furious as the other women.

                         SLAVE MERCHANT
          Her nose is on the large size and her
          chin's a little weak.

                         ERIC
          Your eyes are dim.

                         SLAVE MERCHANT
          I'll give you two gold pieces.

                         ERIC
          After all the business we've done
          together?
          Rose curses behind her gag as Eric pulls her away.

                         SLAVE MERCHANT
          Four gold pieces and that's my final offer!
          Eric doesn't even bother to turn around.

                         ERIC
          I'll peddle my wares elsewhere, thank
          you.
          The slave merchant sees his prize disappearing and calls out:

                         SLAVE MERCHANT
          Ten gold pieces!
          Eric hesitates, but it's not from a guilty conscience, he's just
          considering the price. Then he smiles, turns. They have a deal.

          We get our first good look at grown Snow White as she shaves
          wood for a fire. She's done this every day for years. A
          regimen. Her hands work precisely as she stacks the wood and
          blows on the kindling.

          The fire is now burning and Snow White warms her hands on it.
          She hears APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS. Unusual. She jumps up gets
          in her bed and pretends to sleep.
          A GUARD opens a cell opposite Snow White. A few seconds
          later the door CLANGS SHUT.
          As soon as the Guard is gone, Snow White rises, walks to her
          cell door and looks down the hall to the other cell.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Hello?... What's your name?
          Rose, sitting in a dark corner, goes to her cell bars and
          looks out.

          Snow White smiles - a friendly face.

          Ravenna stands, attended by MAIDS, in a black gown, open in
          front. Appropriate in private but not when --
          Ravenna's GENERALS and Finn stand across from her. The
          Generals avert their eyes, made uncomfortable by her near

          The General uses a pointer to make his presentation while
          another holds a map.

          BLACK KNIGHT GENERAL
          There are scattered rebel groups on the
          fringe of the dark forest, but they cause
          little harm.

          She dips her fingers into a bowl of DEAD SONGBIRDS, plucks
          out a tiny heart and eats it as she listens, not happy.

                         RAVENNA
          And what of the Duke?

          BLACK KNIGHT GENERAL
          We have pushed his forces into the
          mountains but his stronghold at Carmath 
          holds firm.

                         RAVENNA
          Lay siege to it.

                         ANOTHER GENERAL
          The mountains and fortress provide
          impenetrable protection, my Queen.

                         RAVENNA
          Then lure him out! Burn every village
          that supports him. Poison their wells.
          If they still resist put their heads on
          pikes to decorate the roads!

          BLACK KNIGHT GENERAL
          My Queen.
          (chooses words carefully)
          They have taken the fight to us. Rebels
          harry our supply lines and rob our pay
          wagons. 

                         ANOTHER GENERAL
          We have just captured two of the rebel
          leaders. They will be put to the sword.

                         RAVENNA
          I wish to interrogate them myself.
          She drops her robe and walks up the steps to her bath. She
          lowers herself into the white liquid. Her face disappears
          beneath the viscous liquid, then she rises, like a porcelain
          statue.

           ECU - A small songbird, it's chest open, revealing a small
           heart. Ravenna's claw plucks the tiny heart and we follow it
           to her mouth.
           She is dressed now and stands at a window, Finn at her side. 
           OUTSIDE THE WINDOW - A CROWD OF STARVING PEASANTS at the foot 
           of the castle, fight over the milk pouring from her bath.

          She is lost for a moment, then...

          Finn, do you remember when we were
          children, begging for scraps like those
          wretches?

          Rose and Snow White converse...

                         ROSE
          All the girls in our village were taken.
          I was trying to reach safe haven at Duke
          Hammond's castle when I was caught --
          Snow White bursts with hope --

                         SNOW WHITE
          The Duke?! He's alive?! He still fights
          in my father's name?!
          Rose stares at the feral girl now, realizing who she is.

                         ROSE
          You're the king's daughter? Princess?...
          The night the evil one's reign began we
          were told all in the castle were put to
          the sword. How were you spared?

                         SNOW WHITE
          William? What about William?!
          The Duke's son?! Is he alive?!

          Rose shakes her head, still gazing at Snow White, then hears
          the distant cries of other female prisoners.

                         ROSE
          What will they do to me?

          33 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 33

          Ravenna sweeps into the great hall.
          The Generals and Finn snap to attention. She stops and stares
          at TWO MEN, the captured insurgents.
          THOMAS, a grizzled old rebel, looks badly bruised and beaten,
          while his handsome son, LAIN, is unmarked. They both stare at
          her defiantly.
          Ravenna faces the two rebels. A SOLDIER steps forward.

                         SOLDIER
          My Queen, these two were captured leading
          an ambush of our supply caravan.
          Ravenna seems intrigued, steps forward, eyeing them.

                         RAVENNA
          You left your home, your family, the bosom
          of my protection, to aid my enemies? Why?

                         THOMAS
          Because under your rule we have lost
          everything. We will not stop until this
          kingdom is free.

                         RAVENNA
          Lost everything?

                         (REGARDS IAIN)
          Your son?
          She moves to Iain, right up to his face.

                         RAVENNA
          Very handsome.

                         (TO THOMAS)
          Obviously a debt owed to your wife.
          She reaches out and touches Iain's strong jaw. He struggles
          against the Guards that hold him back.

                         RAVENNA
          There was a time I would have lost my heart
          to a face like yours -- and you would have
          no doubt broken mine.
          In a flash Iain grabs a Guard's dagger and rams it into
          Ravenna's chest. She makes a pained face, looks down at the
          dagger, then up to Iain.

                         RAVENNA
          You would kill your Queen?
          She pulls the dagger out - there is no"wound, no blood - and
          drops it on the ground. Iain and Thomas are shocked.

          You have beauty. And courage. But how
          strong is your heart?
          She smiles, almost regrettably, then places her hand on his
          chest. We hear HIS HEART START TO HAMMER -- LOUDER AND LOUDER.
          He grimaces in pain as she SQUEEZES -- the hammering filling his
          ears -- until his heart finally bursts and he drops dead.
          Thomas falls to his knees in horror, trying to revive his son.
          Finn draws his sword to behead him when Ravenna raises her hand.

                         RAVENNA
          No. Let him return to the Duke and speak of
          the generosity of his Queen.
          With that she sweeps out, followed by Finn. It's only now that
          we see the lines on her face. Finn takes her by the arm as she
          falters.

                         FINN
          Are you alright?
          Ravenna pulls her arm away furiously. The General and the
          others stare, alarmed.

                         RAVENNA

                         (TO ALL)

          OUT!!!!!
          They quickly exit, all save Finn, who watches, concerned, as
          Ravenna leans against the wall for support. She pulls
          herself together, looks at Finn.

                         FINN
          Magic comes at a lofty price.

                         RAVENNA
          And the expense grows.

                         FINN
          You look...

                         RAVENNA
          old?...

                         FINN
          Tired.

                         RAVENNA
          My powers... fade.
          This is about as much as Ravenna can confess. Finn watches
          as she walks up the stairs to the mirror chamber. Then he
          turns and CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE. A GUARD appears and Finn
          nods.

          Ravenna walks into the room. Eyes the mirror, afraid to look
          at herself.

          FINN (O.S.)
          I have something for what ails you.
          She turns to see --
          Finn, with Rose. Ravenna almost smiles.
          Rose holds her gaze defiantly. Ravenna walks over, admires
          her face, smiles, then takes her by the throat and --
          LIFTS HER OFF HER FEET. Rose opens her mouth to scream but
          instead of sound, ENERGY pours out. Ravenna opens her mouth,
          DEVOURING GRETA'S YOUTH AND BEAUTY. Like a flower blooming,
          her lines vanish. Like a flower wilting, Rose AGES until
          she's as old as the scullery maids.

          34 INT. PRISON TOWER/ SNOW WHITE'S CELL 34

          Snow White hears approaching footsteps and watches as a Guard
          opens Greta's cell and tosses someone in.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Rose?...
          The Guard clangs the cell door shut and walks away.
          Snow White peers through the shadows. Can't quite make her
          out.

                         SNOW WHITE

          My Queen, you have defied nature and
          robbed it of its fairest fruit. But on
          this day there is one more beautiful than
          you.

          I should have killed her as a child. She
          is my undoing?

                         MIRROR MAN
          She is also your treasure, Queen. It was
          wise to have kept her close for the
          innocence and purity that can destroy can
          also heal. Hold her heart in your hands
          and you shall never again need to consume
          youth. You shall never again weaken or
          age. Immortality without cost!
          Ravenna laughs, overjoyed.
          Finn appears out of the shadows. All he sees is his sister
          laughing, giddily into her mirror, no sign of the mirror man,
          as if it exists only in her head.

                         FINN

          Snow White paces in her cell, frantic.
          Two magpies appear in the window. She looks at them and
          watches as they flap their wings. Like they're trying to
          tell her something. She moves toward them.
          They jump back and up to the edge of the roof that is beside
          the cell window, hovering there.
          She is confused but notices --
          A roofing nail, right where the Magpies hover.
          Snow White reaches a hand out the window and touches the
          loose nail. Her fingers move it back and forth as it, bit by
          bit, breaks free.
          She yanks hard.at the nail, almost has it when --
          The Magpies flutter again and blast away, as if afraid --

          Snow White hears FOOTSTEPS down the hall.
          She steadies herself, yanks once, twice and the nail comes
          loose.
          she jumps down, lies in her bed again just as --
          Finn unlocks her door, leaving the key in the lock, and walks
          into the cell. He stands there until she turns her head
          slightly to him.
          She doesn't move, grips the nail in her closed hand as she
          tries to lure him closer with her eyes.

                         FINN
          Did I wake you?
          Snow White shakes her head gently.

          His finger move from her hair to her cheek, stroking it
          gently, and then to her chest. With his free hand he reaches
          back for his dagger.

          at him. As he leans closer, she notices his off hand - the
          dagger and --
          She SLASHES him across the face with the nail. Blood flies.
          Finn reacts, grabs his face in pain, yells and Snow White
          kicks him and runs for the door, locking it behind --

          39 INT. GRETA'S CELL/ TOWER STEPS - DAY. 39

          Snow White hurtles down the steps to Greta's cell. She is
          shocked by what she sees. Rose, now an old woman, looks to her.
          Snow White fumbles with the keys. Rose holds out both her
          hands. Snow White takes them, looks into her eyes.

                         ROSE
          Go.
          Finn stumbles to the cell door, clutching his face.

                         FINN

          GUARDS!
          Snow White tosses the keys into an empty cell and races away.

          40 INT. CORRIDOR/ CASTLE - DAY. 40

          Snow White runs down the steps into a corridor and sees ARMED
          GUARDS appear at the other end. She hurries into another tower,
          bolting the door shut behind her, and charges down the steps.

          41 EXT. COURTYARD/ CASTLE - DAY. 41

          SNOW WHITE BURSTS OUTSIDE -- into the light. She almost
          hyperventilates at all the air, the sky. Then she runs through
          the courtyard toward the portcullis.
          The magpies fly right into her face then away, telling her to
          follow. She does and heads straight for the small opening at
          the base of the castle wall - the entrance to the SEWERS.
          As the magpies rise, she slides on one hip, plunging into the
          darkness below. The guards follow but can't squeeze through
          the opening, running towards the Portcullis instead.

          42 INT. SEWER - DAY. 42

           Snow White splashes through the deep stinking sludge.

          43 EXT. PORTCULLIS - DAY. 43

           The old rebel, Thomas, with his son's body draped over a mule,
          looks back curiously as he hears the guards yelling --

          CHIEF GUARD 0/S
          Open the gates! The Princess has escaped!
          He stares in surprise as riders gallop out.

          44 EXT. SEA - OUTSIDE CASTLE - DAY. 44

          Snow White is swept out of the sewers into the sea. Seaweed
          wraps itself around her limbs, pulling her deeper.into the
          depths, but she kicks and fights her way back to the surface --
          gasping for air.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           24

          45 EXT. BEACH -- OUTSIDE CASTLE - DAY. 45

          Snow White swims ashore. She looks up and sees a maze of large
          rocks stretching out. She sets off in one direction when the two
          MAGPIES reappear, urging her to follow them in another
          direction. She scrambles after them and sees a WHITE MARE
          waiting for her on the beach, lying on its side, allowing her to
          climb on. The mare raises itself and is away in a flash.

          46 EXT. BEACH - DAY. 46

          Galloping hooves skim the surf, RIDERS pursuing Snow White.

          47 EXT. DECIMATED VILLAGE - DAY. 47

          Snow White rides towards the village -- only it's unrecognizable
          now -- most of the cottages have been razed to the ground or
          boarded up.
          A group of people including children - skeletal, hungry,
          desperate - see her approach and move out to greet her.
          She stops her horse for a moment, gazing past tears at the
          devastation and the state of villagers all around her.
          At first their approach seems harmless but as they get closer
          their faces reveal dangerous desperation and --
          She gallops off, looking back to see the Queen's men giving
          chase.

          48 EXT. FIELDS AND WOODLAND BEYOND THE VILLAGE - DAY. 48

          The fields and woods are even more devastated than the village.
          Farmland has been burnt to cinders and trees chopped down. All
          around Snow White the world is stubble and ash.

          49 EXT. ENDLESS MOOR - AERIAL SHOT - DAY. 49

          Snow White crests a hill, her mare rearing as she sees -- THE
          DARK FOREST -- A VAST WALL OF PRIMORDIAL TREES. A mist seeps
          from the forest like an evil miasma. Snow white hesitates --
          then sees the riders closing in and urges her mare on --

          50 EXT. MISTY BOGS/ ENTRANCE TO THE DARK FOREST - DAY. 50

          Shadows everywhere. The mare charges into the misty bog then
          suddenly loses her footing. She rears -- throwing Snow White
          onto the safety of solid ground.
          Snow White tries to grab her reins but the horse pulls away, not
          wanting to endanger her life. She tries again but the horse
          backs farther away from her. Slowly they're separated by the
          swirling fog --
          As Snow White sees the silhouettes of the riders reappear.
          Reluctantly she turns and runs into the forest --

                         50 CONTINUED: 50
          The riders are about to follow when their horses rear and kick
          in terror. One guard is thrown off and sucked down in the bog,
          frightening off the others.
          Despite their concern for Snow White, the MAGPIES are also too
          afraid to enter the forest.

          51 EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY. 51

          Snow White hurtles through the trees, a ghostly fog rising up
          all around her, then trips over a root, landing face first in --
          A patch of LARGE MUSHROOMS that unleash CLOUDS OF POLLEN. She
          coughs, trying to fan the pollen away, but it's too late. She
          hurries on, but the hallucinations come thick and fast now --
          The trees look almost human, hooded figures peering at her
          through the haze. She sees owls without eyes. Black oil oozing
          out of tree trunks. A hanging vine reaches down and touches her
          like a hand and now she runs --
          More terrors rage at her from the swirling mist. She stumbles
          again and when she looks up vampire bats scream at her from the
          trees. Huge skeletal forms crack out of the bark, descending on
          her until she finally passes out.

          52 EXT. AERIAL VIEW OF DARK FOREST -- DAY.(D4N) 52

          From high above, we see the unconscious Snow White as mist
          whirls in a circle.
          52a EXT. CASTLE BEACH - NIGHT.(D4N) 52a
          Vicious waves crash into rocks. Nature's anger on display.

          53 INT. MIRROR CHAMBER - NIGHT. 53

          From above we see Ravenna striding furiously in a circle of
          her own. She is livid, a whirling dervish.
          She's fairly spitting as she barks at Finn, who stands in the
          middle of the room, his face bleeding.

                         RAVENNA
          How is it an innocent young girl makes a
          fool of my brother?! Armed only with a
          nail?! If she'd had a sword she'd have
          taken the whole castle!
          We're in front of her, behind her, on her face, on her feet --
          She picks up the pace as well as the volume --

                         RAVENNA
          You swore to protect me! Do you not
          understand what, the girl means to us?!

          And then she stops on a dime, turns to him, marches right up to
          Finn and --
          BELTS HIM! Hard. He staggers a bit then picks himself up,
          looks at her.

                         FINN
          She was chased into the dark forest.
          She's likely already dead.
          She SCREAMS and slaps him viciously.

          She's no good to me there, lost. I must
          have her heart! You have failed me!

                         FINN
          Have I not given all to you?!
          She takes this, softens, unexpectedly, and almost smiles.

                         RAVENNA
          Have I not given you all? All.
          She raises her finger and touches his face. His wound heals
          instantly and his face grows calm. He nods.

                         FINN
          Indeed, my Queen.

          Still no takers. An OLD-TIMER stares right at FINN, steps
          forwards.

          There's one man. A widower.

          THE SOUND OF SMASHING WOOD. They turn to see --
          Eric flies through the Inn's wall and lands in a heap on the
          ground.

                         OLD-TIMER

          Eric. Drunk. He tries to focus as Broch strides through the

          I have it right here in my pocket. If
          you'll just help me up.
          Eric holds his hand out. Broch walks over, suspicious. When
          he's close, Eric grabs his arm and kicks with both feet in
          Broch's chest. Broch flies back, then strides to Eric and
          kicks him in the side. Hurts.

                         BROCH
          I want my money!

                         ERIC
          Actually, I seem to have drunk it all.
          You're welcome to it when it comes out
          again.
          Broch hauls him back up to his feet. He takes a swing but
          somehow the drunken Eric dodges the blow, swinging back at
          him.
          Everyone has come out of the Inn to enjoy the fight.
          Eric lands a body blow to Broch, who doubles over. Eric
          comes in for the kill, winds up and swings -
          Missing Broch but hitting a HORSE on the ass. It kicks its
          legs, sending him flying. He lands in a heap and drops his
          head back.
          Hands lift him and --
          Drop him in a horse trough. He's underwater for a few
          seconds before he comes to and lifts out his head, eyes still

          the room, eyes the ravens, then looks at --
          Ravenna on her throne. She watches him curiously. He's more
          interested in the aged scullery maids, including Rose, who are
          staring at him accusingly. He has no idea who they are or what
          he's done wrong. Finally he comes before the Queen, sizing her
          up like a tavern beauty.

                         RAVENNA
          So you wish to be reunited with your
          beloved?
          Eric reacts instinctively, grabbing her by the throat. The
          courtiers rise to their feet and the guards draw their
          swords, but Ravenna holds up her hand.

                         ERIC
          My wife is none of your concern.
          Something about her face, the fact that she enjoys his hand
          on her throat makes Eric queasy. He releases his grip,
          stares right at Ravenna.

                         RAVENNA
          My condolences.
          Ravenna holds his gaze.

                         RAVENNA
          You miss her?
          His eyes say, yes, he misses her horribly.

                         RAVENNA
          What would you give to bring her back?
          Eric stares at her curiously.

                         RAVENNA
          You know of my powers. Bring me the girl
          and I will bring back your wife.

                         ERIC
          Nothing will bring her back.
          Ravenna moves even closer, looks him right in the eye. She
          is incredibly persuasive as she says --

                         RAVENNA
          I can. Believe me, huntsman.
          Eric's eyes say he wants to believe. Needs to believe.

                         RAVENNA
          A life for a life.

          59 EXT. MOORS/ OUTSIDE DARK FOREST - DAY. 59

          Mist drifts across the moors, the primordial trees looming up
          ahead. Finn and Eric ride side by side, FOUR GUARDS following.

          Eric nods without looking at him, gazing at the forest.

                         FINN
          You must have seen a great deal of death?

                         ERIC
          Death is everywhere.

                         FINN
          Come now, you're being modest. There is a
          difference between gutting a deer and
          gutting a man. How many did you kill?

                         ERIC
          It's not something I counted.

                         FINN

          Nor I. But I recall every face. There is
          no greater delight than battle.
          Eric finds this unseemly, but prefers not to engage.

                         FINN
          Come now, huntsman, what do you feel when
          you watch a man die? Delight?
          Invincibility?

                         (HONESTLY)
          Sorrow.
          This takes Finn aback, not an answer he was expecting. After
          a beat...

                         FINN
          And what of them? At the tip of your
          sword. What do they feel? I'd enjoy
          knowing.
          Eric looks at him, realizing from Finn's face that it is an
          honest question. -

                         FINN
          The.only difference between you and I is
          I'-never found a wife to save my soul.

          They are all stopped at the entrance to the Dark Forest fifty
          meters ahead. The Guards gulp back their fears. Finn tries
          to hide his own.
          Even the horses sense danger and start to whinny and back up.

          60 EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY. 60

          Vines and roots have grown over Snow White's body, as if the
          forest is trying to devour her. She opens her eyes, sees her
          wrists and ankles bound and reacts in horror, struggling to free
          herself of her bonds.
          WE PULL UP, UP, UP until we can see the full scope of the
          Dark Forest.

          61 EXT. BOGS/ DARK FOREST - DAY. 61

          Eric and Finn have tethered their nervous horses and stand at
          the entrance to the bog.

                         ERIC
          Do exactly as I do.
          Eric carefully places one foot after the next on grassy stepping
          stones that disappear into the bog as soon as his full weight is
          on them. The others catch on and follow, stepping on stones of
          their own.
          Once they're across the bog and onto dry land Finn takes a
          step forward but Eric grabs his arm.

                         ERIC
          Exactly as I do.
          Eric puts a cloth to his face, gesturing for Finn and his guards
          to do the same and moves forward through the mushroom field -
          pops of pollen misting all around them.
          Eric stops, bends down, spotting faint FOOTPRINTS in the dew. He
          walks faster now, Finn watching in admiration.

           Snow White finally shakes free of the vines, jumps up and senses
           she's being followed. She looks up at the trees but all she sees
           are vague shadows. The wind picks up, ghostly voices howling in
          the breeze. She's rooted to the spot for a moment, then loses
          her nerve and runs --
          64aEXT. DARK FOREST - DAY. 64a
          Eric, Finn and the Guards move through a dark copse of trees.
          VOICES AND WHISPERS-call to them from the wind. Eric stops,
          looks around.

                         ERIC
          Pay them no mind.
          One of the Guards leans over a pool of water to drink when he
          sees a GHOSTLY REFLECTION gazing back at him. He stares in
          surprise, leaning closer. Suddenly a BARBED TAIL shoots out
          of the water -- skewering him -- and drags him into the
          depths.
          The others turn as they hear a scream but there's no sign of
          their companion now, just the bubbling water.
          Only Finn looks unconcerned.
          Eric stops senses something, holds up a hand.
          Then darts ahead, leaving them flat-footed. Finn makes a
          decision to follow and waves for his Guards to go ahead of
          him.
          They reluctantly follow Eric.

          65 EXT. DARK FOREST - MOMENTS LATER - DAY. 65

          Eric moves quickly then stops, listens - we see his hunting
          skills - as he hears the noise of cracking branches in the
          distance, he blasts away, moving like lightning.

          66 EXT. TREES/ DARK FOREST - DAY. 66

          Snow White feels like the whole forest is pursuing her. Running
          out of breath, she hides in some bushes. As she stares into the
          mist, she sees a sinister figure appear through the haze.
          Eric stops and looks around, sensing his prey is close. Snow
          White stays low, trying to quieten her breathing.
          Eric studies the forest floor. He sees Snow White's footprints,
          then looks up at an area of disturbed undergrowth.
          Snow White peers through the bushes and sees the huntsman's
          boots approaching. She looks around for something to defend
          herself with when the sound of the footsteps fades. She can't
          see anyone now. She looks relieved when SUDDENLY STRONG HANDS

          GRAB HER BY THE FEET AND DRAG HER OUT OF THE BUSHES.
          She fights to get away but he pins her with a foot, reaches
          down and turns her over.
          His first look at her gives him pause. Her face, her spirit,
          her youth. She slaps at him - he pulls out his knife with
          one hand while he pins her with the other.
          Then grabs, lifts her.

                         SNOW WHITE

          She bites him. He grimaces and grabs her tighter and starts
          trudging back.

                         SNOW WHITE
          She's going to kill me! The Oueen!
          He ignores, keeps moving.

          Sure she is.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Believe me! Her brother tried to cut out
          my heart.
          He stops, looks at her.

          Him! He's the one! He came at me with a
          knife!

          Finn shakes his head and laughs.

                         FINN
          You are a drunk and a fool. My Queen has
          many powers; she can take life or sustain
          it. But she can't bring your wife back
          from the dead.

                         ERIC

          I WANT HER BACK!
          His face tells us how much Eric wanted, needed to believe.
          The Guards keep inching toward Eric.
          Eric, still with a knife to Snow White's throat, starts
          slowly backing up.
          Finn pulls his own sword and approaches.
          Four against one. As they burst toward him he tosses Snow
          White to the ground and in the same motion throws his knife
          into the chest of one of the Guards, who crumbles.
          Eric reaches behind, grabs both hatchets and faces off with
          the others.
          They all rush at once. Eric fights off the guards as he
          raises a hatchet, throws it --
          Right into Finn's chest. Just like Ravenna, no blood, no
          wound. Finn pulls it out, laughs and throws it at the
          huntsman who ducks as it sticks into a tree.
          Snow White, terrified, races off into the forest. They
          notice her exit but keep fighting.
          Eric fights on three sides now - holding his own until Finn
          manages to plunge a sword in his side.

          off but Eric lunges and --
          Flips Finn onto his back and into a grove of mushrooms.
          Eric covers his nose with his arm and looks at the other
          Guards, who look from Finn, who is dazed, to Eric, who is
          hurt.
          Finn struggles to his knees, shakes his head, hallucinating a
          bit.

          The Guards, also trying to cover their noses, move forward.
          Eric has a decision to make.
          Bad odds. And he's injured. Eric decides in an instant,
          grabs his knife out of the dead Guard, as well as his hatchet
          from the tree and runs after Snow White --

          Snow White crashes through the woods.
          Then a HAND grabs her shoulder--
          Eric. He slaps a palm over her mouth before she can scream
          and slides down a steep slope into undergrowth.

          At once she PUNCHES HIM WITH ALL SHE'S GOT.
          He steps back, licks his bloody lip. She takes another swing.
          This one he manages to grab.

                         SNOW WHITE
          I need to get to the Duke's Castle.
          There's an army there. I'll be safe.

                         ERIC
          The Duke? I've seen sheep with more fight
          in them.
          Desperate, she takes a chance.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Take me, you'll be rewarded.
          I'm valuable. Isn't that why you're here?

                         SHE APPEALS:

                         SNOW WHITE
          You're dead if you return without me. And
          I'm dead if you leave me.
          He turns, exasperated with her.

                         ERIC
          (Then -- wearily:)
          Just for argument's sake.
          (Shakes his head)
          How much?

                         SNOW WHITE
          How much is enough?
          Eric "reluctantly" prices up the job.

                         ERIC
          Well,it's a long way, through the
          forest, and that... that's a dangerous
          road, I couldn't even consider it for
          less than thirty gold pieces...

                         SNOW WHITE
          A hundred. Deliver me safe to the Duke. I
          give you my word.

          She looks at him levelly.

          Maybe that's a question you should have
          asked the queen.
          Stand-off.

          He spits on his hand. She puts out her hand.
          He shakes it.

          I still don't trust you.

          Tree roots gleam with an eerie phosphorescent light. The mist
          closes in. Snow White looks around the forest, unnerved by
          the haunting silence and the deep shadows. Reluctantly she
          focuses on Eric, trying to take her mind off the terrors
          around her.
          He sits on a log for a breath.

          THOMAS, whose son was killed by Ravenna.

          One of the other mercenaries grins, then rides towards
          William, drawing his sword. He raises it when William
          unslings his bow and loosens two arrows at close range,
          hitting him in each thigh and knocking him off his horse.
          Broch draws his enormous battle axe, about to charge, when

          the ground.

                         FINN
          Replace him.
          William looks at Finn gratefully. Finn studies him with a
          curious smile then rides on.

          Snow White approaches a stream, kneels, splashes her face and
          brings a handful of water to her lips.

                         ERIC
          I wouldn't do that if I were you.
          Not unless you want your bowels to rip
          apart.
          She turns. Eric has been snoozing on a rock, with one eye
          open. She releases the water, stands and faces off with Eric,
          who offers his flask of mead. She reluctantly takes a sip,
          spits most of it out, hands it back.
          He smells something, walks a few steps, bends down and examines
          a long brown pellet shaped object on the ground.

                         SNOW WHITE
          What is it?

                         ERIC
          A fumee.

          You want me to call it by another name?
          He doesn't need to. It's an animal dropping. Snow White winces
          as he kneads it between his fingers and takes a long sniff.

          She catches the look of fear in his eyes as he gazes around the
          woods.

                         ERIC
          Stay here.
          He moves away, though the trees, tracking prey. He hears the
          wind call his name...

                         SARA
          Eric.
          He stops, looks to --
          An outcropping of rocks, surrounded by dense forest. From
          out behind a tree steps an apparition of SARA. She's
          beautiful.

                         ERIC
          Sara?...

          BACK TO SNOW WHITE
          She hears him call out and follows his tracks.

          BACK TO HUNTSMAN
          Sara holds out her hand.

                         ERIC
          Am I dreaming?

                         SARA
          Touch me and see for yourself.
          Eric shakes his head, looks around, tries to fight it, but...
          Her face draws him back and he begins to walk toward the
          rocks.

                         SARA
          You weren't there to save me, Eric. I
          called for you but you never came.
          Snow White appears behind and sees --
          Eric is walking toward a dark area where several sets of
          lupine eyes await.
          But Eric only sees Sara and he continues to move toward her.
          She opens her arms to him and steps backwards, luring him.

                         SARA
          Where were you, Eric? Come to me now.
          Protect me now.

           He takes another step toward her and --
          Buckles - THWACK!
          Snow White hits him behind his knees with a piece of wood.
          He hits the ground and she drags him away. He fights back and
          she jumps on top of him, staring right into his face.

                         SNOW WHITE
          She's not real! Not real! Do you hear
          me?!
          He does and calms. She gets off him and he sits up, fatigued
          by the experience. A low point for him.
          He reaches for his flask -- pours the last single drop into
          his mouth. All gone. He tosses it aside. A lost soul.
          Snow White watches him with some compassion. He catches her
          look, gets up and walks away.
          83b EXT. DARK FOREST OPEN AREA - DAY 83b
          Snow White catches up.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Who is she? The one you bargained for.
          The one that spoke to you. Who is Sara?

                         ERIC
          A name you'll not mention again.
          He tosses a knife to her. She's surprised but catches it.

                         SNOW WHITE
          What?

                         ERIC
          Feel its weight. One hand to the other.
          She shakes her head but does so.

          Now hold it - business end pointed at me.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Why are you?--
          He lunges at her and she raises the blade.

          He jumps at her again and she puts her right foot forward,
          knife in right hand pointed. He starts to slowly move toward
          her. One step at a time.

                         ERIC
          Now stay back. You're too small to
          attack. You have to parry; use your
          opponents strength against him. Raise
          your opposing forearm.
          She does. He comes closer.

                         ERIC
          With it you block and deflect an opposing
          thrust. You'll lose meat but you won't
          die from it. Wait until I'm close.
          He steps forward.

                         ERIC
          Not yet. Watch my hands, not my eyes.
          He moves even closer.

          Not yet. Not until you can feel my
          breath.

          Their faces are inches apart.

          hilt. Now look in my eyes.

          Don't pull it out 'til you see my soul.
          Their eyes are still locked.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Why do I need to learn how to kill?
          He looks at her.

          There's a lot you need to learn lass.
          Eric backs away.

          Keep that.
          She nods, now-focused on him in a way other than as an
          instructor. He turns and walks away.

          A single blossom flowers on the dying apple tree. Ravenna,
          looking weaker than before, stares at it quietly, as if she
          were gazing at Snow White. She reaches out and crushes the
          blossom in her hand, turning it into ash.
          Her look is one of conviction.

                         RAVENNA
          Find her.

          Finn reacts as if he heard Ravenna's words. He did. They have
          that kind of connection. Spooked, he continues on. The other
          trackers follow, William looking tense. At the back of the
          group, one of the mercenaries slows down, sensing something in
          the forest.
          William is still watching Finn when they hear a bloodcurdling
          CRY behind them. The mercenary's horse gallops out of the trees
          without its rider, a gaping wound in its side. William and the
          others look shaken but Finn doesn't even turn around, riding on.
          87a EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY. 87a
          Eric pulls Snow White along. Beyond a bridge we see open fens
          -- the bridge LEADS OUT OF THE DARK FOREST -- and birds
          circling on the distant horizon.
          Snow White looks relieved as she follows him down a slope.
          They hurry through a sea of mist when suddenly Eric stops.

                         SNOW WHITE
          What is it?

                         ERIC
          It can't be this easy.
          He quietly unsheathes a hatchet.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Is this the end of the Dark Forest?

                         SNOW WHITE
          How far to the Duke's castle?
          He ignores, follows tracks, then stops as he sees the STONE
          BRIDGE below -- LEADING OUT OF THE DARK FOREST. Snow White
          stares at it too, relieved. Beyond the bridge there are open
          fens.
          They hurry down together and start to cross the bridge.
          They're half way across WHEN SUDDENLY WE SEE THE STONES START

          TO MOVE BEHIND THEM --

          A PAIR OF EYES OPENS IN THE STONE, AND SLOWLY THE BRIDGE

          STARTS TO RISE --
          Snow White turns to see -- A HUGE CREATURE REARING UP --

          TWENTY FEET TALL. IT'S NOT A BRIDGE AT ALL BUT A --

                         ERIC
          Troll!
          Eric and Snow White are SLAMMED off the bridge and land in
          the shallow creek below -- among the CARCASSES OF SLAIN
          ANIMALS. The troll roars and comes after them, swinging its
          giant stone fists. Eric grabs Snow White and runs --
          As the troll catches up with them, Eric shoves her out of the
          way and draws his hatchets.

                         ERIC
          Run!
          Snow White turns and flees. Eric runs at the Troll. He ducks
          as a mighty arm sweeps over him, darts between the troll's
          legs, and hacks at its leg with his hatchets.
          The Troll falters a bit then --
          A swinging stone fist catches him and hurls him across the
          creek.
          Snow White looks back to see Eric lying stunned on the
          ground, his wound bleeding again, at the troll's mercy. She
          hesitates, still terrified, then runs back.
          The Troll towers over the huntsman. It raises its stone hands
          to crush him when --
          Snow White arrives -- SCREAMING LIKE A BANSHEE!
          The Troll looks around in surprise. So does Eric. A beat,
          then the monster turns away from Eric, striding towards Snow

                         WHITE --
          She stands her ground, fighting her terror, PULLS HER KNIFE.
          The TROLL looms over her, but she doesn't retreat. She raises
          an arm, just as Eric instructed.

          Snow White stares into the troll's eyes, seeing something
          almost gentle in its monstrous gaze, slowly losing her fear.
          The troll stares at her too, confused, then slowly pacified,
          until it finally turns and strides away.
          Eric stares in disbelief. Snow White is rooted to the spot,
          also confused but strangely moved by what's happened. Eric
          rises to his feet painfully and heads over, taking her by the
          arm.

                         ERIC
          I told you to run.

                         SNOW WHITE
          If I had you'd be dead. A "thank you"
          would suffice.
          It's clear he sees her in a different light. She stares back
          at him. Eric holds her gaze, struggling a bit, then...

                         ERIC
          Thank you.

          88 EXT. MARSHES - DAY. 88

          The sun glints through the thinning trees. Eric wades through
          the deep sludge, Snow White following in his steps.
          Eric looks at her a moment, then suddenly turns away as he
          sees her expression change --
          GHOSTLY BACKLIT FIGURES EMERGE on the banks of the marsh now,
          holding bows and arrows. Eric looks around for an escape route,
          but everywhere he turns MORE FIGURES APPEAR.
          He draws his axe when A FIGURE IN A HOODED CLOAK (ANNA) appears,
          clutching her bow like a goddess.

                         ANNA
          They say only demons or spirits can
          survive the dark forest. Which are you?
          Eric, unsure, pulls his hatchet and steps in front of Snow
          White protecting her.

                         ERIC
          Which are you?

          face. And then a smile.

          The fenland village is made up of mud huts, elevated on stilts
          to protect them from flooding.

          Gone.
          Anna paddles a boat as they approach the village. Eric and
          Snow White speak quietly.

          ON THE BANK
          The boat stops and they get out. The women of the village
          move from their hut to greet them as they walk into the
          village.
          More women emerge from their huts to view the newcomers, no
          men in sight. They all have scarred faces.
          All the women have assembled alongside the group, watching
          with awe as they pass. They stare at Snow White and murmur.
          They can't take their eyes off her. Some even reach out to
          touch her sleeve or dress.

                         SNOW WHITE
          (sotto; to Eric)
          Why are they looking at me like that?

                         ERIC
          I don't know, but keep smiling.
          A beautiful LITTLE GIRL, LILY, moves away from her friends
          and offers her hand. Snow White stops, looks down at the
          girl, trying not to stare at her scar.

          Eric sits by the lake, ANNA bandaging his wounds.

                         ANNA
          You have travelled far Huntsman. With a
          heavy burden.
          Snow white is playing with Lily. They are making little dolls
          from straw.

                         ERIC
          I've had worse jobs. And anyway, she's
          not that heavy.

                         ANNA
          You mean... you do not know who she is?
          His eyes narrow.

                         ERIC
          What do you mean?
          He looks over.

          Who is she?

          ACROSS THE WAY
          Snow White draws eyes upon the doll.
          Snow White's eyes fill with tears.

                         LILY
          My father showed me how to make them. But
          he's gone away.
          Lily takes a stick and marks the dolls face with a scar..

                         LILY
          Here. She's finished.
          She hands it to her.

          She's beautiful.
          Lily smiles and runs off to play. Behind her Eric appears.

                         SNOW WHITE
          These women... This place.. It's very
          peaceful. But it makes me very sad.

                         ERIC
          Why didn't you tell me?
          She stops. She knows.

                         ERIC
          Because I'd think it too fell a task?
          You'd be right.
          She looks at him. Shakes her head.

                         SNOW WHITE
          That's not why. It's because I've never
          said the words.
          She looks at Lily playing.

                         SNOW WHITE
          I'm not sure I believe it myself. I never
          felt like a..
          (She stops.)
          Alone in a dark cell. For years. Fighting
          to cling to memories. What he looked
          like. Smelled like. The kind man with the
          big arms and the wonderful smiles.. To
          me.. he wasn't The King. He was my
          father.
          Eric doesn't know what to say. In time, he reaches in his
          pocket.

                         ERIC

          What is it?

                         ERIC
          I've carried it a long time.

                         SNOW WHITE
          What is it made of?

          The stag's the most timid animal in the
          forest but there's a bone in it's heart
          that gives it courage in it's hour of
          need and makes it the bravest in of all
          God's creatures. It's a protection charm.

                         (HE SHRUGS)
          Or so they say.
          They share a look.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Was it hers?
          It's the most honest and emotional he's been with her.

                         ERIC
          Take it.
          She does.

                         SNOW WHITE

          He looks at the sky.

          Snow White lies in her bed. Nearby sleep Anna and Lily.

                         SNOW WHITE
          She's so beautiful.

                         ANNA
          That is not a kind thing to say in these
          times. Youth one cannot alter... beauty,
          however. We have sacrificed beauty to
          raise our children in peace. And you,
          your sacrifice will come, princess.

          time soon comes when you must deliver
          that sacrifice. Will you be ready?
          Anna suddenly stops. As if something has disturbed her. She
          gets up and leaves.

                         SNOW WHITE

          Eric makes his way along the perimeter, finding a path
          through the trees. Suddenly he stops. Turns.
          Twenty feet away. It's Anna.

                         ANNA
          How can you desert her now you know the
          truth?

                         ERIC
          Aye I know the truth. And that's exactly
          why she should be as far from me as
          possible.

                         ANNA
          She's the only one that can save us. She
          needs you.

                         ERIC
          Trust me. I'm the last thing she needs.
          I'm bad luck. Everything I've ever cared
          about was destroyed.

          pocket. Then smells smoke, walks outside and looks up to see --
          The sky BLAZES WITH BURNING ARROWS all raining down on the
          village.

          Snow White re-enters the hut just as A FLAMING ARROW pierces
          through the thatch and sticks next to Lily's sleeping head.
          Snow White pushes Lily away from the fire and grabs the
          arrow. Anna SCREAMS because -
          A MERCENARY races into the hut.
          On impulse Snow White backhand STABS HIM in the leg WITH THE
          FLAMING ARROW and he tumbles, flames burning his clothes.
          Snow White stares at him for a moment, his face, his pain.
          Anna shakes her out of the moment and they all race out.

           Snow White runs with Lily and Anna when she sees a FEARSOME
           MERCENARY leap off his horse and stride towards them.

                          (TO ANNA)
           Run!
          Snow White faces off with the Mercenary. She does as she's been
          taught - waits for him to approach. When he's close enough to
          grab her slashes at him with the knife. The huge mercenary
          knocks her to the ground and advances on her.
          -- when an arrow strikes him in the shoulder. He falls,
          revealing a young warrior holding a bow.
          It's WILLIAM. Snow White stares at him through the flames, with
          a mixture of recognition and uncertainty.
          It's as if for a moment everything stops as she comes

          FACE TO FACE
          With something from the past. Almost like a ghost. Or a
          vision.. He nods to her in recognition.
          She stands perfectly still.

          killing TWO MORE MERCS as he makes his way forward.

          Eric pulls Snow White onwards, the blazing fires from the
          village lighting up the marsh. He sees a lake up ahead when a
          figure appears, blocking their way. It's the giant BROCH.
          Grinning, he unstraps his huge axe, ready to face Eric one more
          time. Eric doesn't even slow down, letting go of Snow White and
          unstrapping his own hatchets. It looks as if it's going to be an
          epic fight, but as Broch swings, Eric ducks and drives both
          hatchets into the giant's ribs, killing him instantly.
          They escape into the darkness.

          The "old woman" just stares at her, shakes her head. There's
          something in the woman's eyes that terrifies Ravenna. She
          backs up, retreating, then scurries away.

          118C INT.ANTE ROOM - ROYAL PALACE - NIGHT (MOVED FROM B4B). 118C

           Ravenna sits alone, naked. Her spine stretches through her 
          taut skin. 
          In front of her sits the CROWN on a dark cushion, a matted
          tuft of HAIR caught on the gilded edge. She stares at it,
          then slowly raises her hand to a bald patch at the side of
          her hair.

                          

                         RAVENNA

          FINN!!!!!!!!!
          The word echoes in the palace --

          119 EXT. FENLAND VILLAGE - NIGHT 119

           Finn, surrounded by smoke and fire, is beyond frustration.
           He screams to the heavens in despair.

          121 EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY. 121

          Eric and Snow White are far down river. They make their way to
          the bank, drenched and exhausted. Snow White's hands shake -
          distraught over the violence at the village. Eric looks at her
          guiltily.

          I led them there. I am to blame.
          Snow White looks at him with empathy. He's in pain, too.

                         ERIC
          I will take you to Duke Hammond's.
          Snow White slowly nods.
          Eric lies back and looks up at the sun flickering through the
          trees. It dances on his face and then --
          A HUGE SHADOW blots out the light.
          Before he can react, fists and boots lay into him. As he
          protects his face, we catch glimpses of brutal figures in
          battle masks. Eric kicks a couple of them away, but more of
          them swarm over him, pinning him down in leg locks and choke
          holds.
          Snow White is treated just as roughly, powerful arms and legs
          pinning her down. She bites one of her captors and he twists
          her arms behind her back. A noose is slung around Eric's
          ankles and he's hauled up - hanging upside down. Snow White,
          also tied up, sits on the ground beside him.
          A line of DWARVES stand before them and pull up their
          grotesque BATTLE MASKS.
          The dwarf leader, Beith glowers.

                         BEITH
          Well, well, well... the miscreant
          huntsman.

                         ERIC
          Come on, Beith! Is this how you treat a
          friend?
          The dwarf leader, BEITH, glowers.

                         BEITH
          No, you horn beast, this is how I treat a
          friend!
          He smacks Eric with a gnarled stick.

          Snow White and the huntsman are still trussed up like chickens
          now. The dwarves are grouped together, arguing and occasionally
          throwing angry glances toward Eric. As they bicker the dwarves
          slap and bite at each other - like animals.

          What did you do to them?

                         ERIC
          I tried to collect the bounty on their
          heads. A few times.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Is there no one you haven't wronged?
          Eric nods at her. "You."

                         ERIC
          But there's always tomorrow.

                         GORT

          The Dwarf confab breaks up and they approach.

          This is my lucky day, the puttock I loathe
          most in the world lands in my lap.

                         ERIC
          It is your lucky day, Beith. I've got
          enough gold to keep you in ale for a year.
          Cut me down and I'll --
          NION, Beith's right hand man and a fervent dwarf supremacist,
          clips Eric around the ear.

                         NION
          Shut your ugly mug, huntsman. You had any
          pennies they would have fallen out your
          pockets by now.

                         ERIC
          It's hidden. Back there, in the woods. A
          short distance.
          They get the reference, don't like it. Nion slaps Eric again.

                         NION
          Pull the other one, you lying dangler.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Tell them the truth, huntsman.
          The youngest of the dwarves, GUS, is beaming at Snow White with
          his dirty teeth.

          prettiest thing I ever did seen.
          He smiles, almost sweetly, disarming her. Snow White looks at
          her other captors now, noticing a blind dwarf, (MUIR), who sits
          with his son (QUERT), also gazing at her.

          I saved this girl from the Queen. Out of
          the goodness of my heart.
          Snow White gives him a look. He calms her with a look of his
          own.

                         BEITH
          Doesn't sound like you, huntsman.

          Nion gives Eric another smack around the head.

                         MUIR
          Quert?
          Quert jumps to and helps his father as he makes his way to
          Snow White. He touches her face and something happens in
          him. His demeanor softens and the hint of a smile lands on
          his lips. Meanwhile...

                         GORT
          So what's the verdict?

                         COLL
          Leave 'em to rot.

                         DUIR
          Yeah. Or skewer him and leave her to rot!

                         COLL
          That would work, too, but my way's
          cleaner.
          Note: Coll and Duir have this "at each other but we're
          comrades" relationship. Coll also has an incessant cough.

                         MUIR
          No!
          (a beat for emphasis)
          She is destined.
          They all trade looks. Muir is the spiritual leader of the
          group and they dare not speak against him, even Beith.

          But not strong enough in this case.

          My father was King Magnus.
          This carries weight with the group. Impressed.

          From their hidden vantage point, Eric, Snow White, and the

          a small troop remain behind. Realizing they have no choice but
          to retreat further, Duir and Coll signal and the dwarves follow

          Snow White and the huntsman emerge from the cave to see a
          shimmering landscape of glistening moss and sunlight. It's like
          a mirage. The air is filled with specks of pollen and a strange
          HUMMING NOISE echoes like music. For Snow White, it's the most
          beautiful sound she's ever heard. Next to her, Nion, snorts:

                         NION
          Blasted fairy music. Wish I had some wax to

          There's plenty of moss.
          GORT scoops up a handful of moss and moulds himself some ear
          plugs, sticking them in his ears. Snow White is still mesmerized
          by the fairy music and the shimmering haze.

                         SNOW WHITE

          They call it Sanctuary, my lady. The
          Enchanted Forest. It's the home of the
          fairies.
          And slowly the hazy curtain gives way to an enchanted forest --
          as different to the dark forest as one could imagine --
          Life grows everywhere -- LUSH GRASS, PROUD TREES COVERED IN

          Coll and Duir sit away from the others, gazing out with the
          thousand yard stare of hardened war veterans.

                         COLL
          That song takes me back to the battle of
          Tylweth Gate. A small horde versus an army.
          Pickaxes against swords and spears.

                         DUIR
          Them were the days.

                         (BEAT)
          What happened to your quailing cough?
          Coll shakes his head, "dunno". The two of them smile then join
          in the singing. A drunken GORT takes a swig of ale and staggers
          over to GUS.

                         GORT
          Play louder, you whey-face, I can still
          hear those harpy fairies.
          He takes another swig and sings at the top of his voice, out of
          tune, trying to drown out the humming of the unseen fairies.
          Snow White and the huntsman look on, smiling.

                         ERIC
          Legend has it dwarves were created to
          uncover all the riches hidden on earth. Not
          just gold and precious stones, but the
          beauty in people's hearts.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Really?

                         ERIC
          Ask me, they've lost the art if they ever
          had it. When the Queen seized their mines
          she stole their treasure but more than that
          she stole their pride.
          And as if to prove it, GORT and NION sing and share from a flask
          of rum before they tumble to the ground-near Muir as the song
          ends. Eric notices the tumble and chuckles.

                         GORT
          What are you pribbling at, longshanks?!

                         ERIC
          Nothing half-wit.

                         GORT
          I'm half of nothing.you canker blossom.

          Perched on his stone, QUERT nods; sings a more CHEERFUL SONG.
          Eric watches as Snow White walks over to Muir. Before she can
          say anything...

          That seat's not taken, if that's what you
          were about to ask.
          She sits on the log beside him. Gort and Nion eye her.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Thank you so much, sir.

                         MUIR
          It's only a log, no need to praise me.

                         SNOW WHITE
          No. For before. For defending me.

                         MUIR
          Your father was a good man. The kingdom
          prospered. Our people prospered.

                         SNOW WHITE
          There were more of you?

                         MUIR
          Aye.
          And that is all Muir will say on the subject. Gort fills in.

                         GORT
          One day the group you see before you went
          down into the mine for a month long
          shift. Gus was only a boy. When we came
          back to the surface... nothing. The land
          was black, everything, everyone... dead,
          gone. We searched but...
          Gort surprises himself by choking up a bit. Muir helps out.

                         MUIR
          That was the month your father died.

                         SNOW WHITE
          I'm so sorry.

                         MUIR
          As am I, princess. As am I.
          GUS walks over to Snow White.

                         GUS
          I know I'm a bit spongy to look at, Miss,
          but would you care to dance-with a little
          'un?

                         SNOW WHITE
          I'd be honored.
          Snow White gets up and dances with Gus as the song picks up.

          Nion and Gort watch her dance with Gus. Nion's not
          impressed, leans in to Gort...

                         NION
          I don't trust her. And I don't believe
          in her, no matter what Muir says.
          Gort is still melancholy...

                         GORT
          Just you and me,... do you think there
          are any of us left? Do you think perhaps
          they were merely banished?

                         NION
          As long as the Queen's in charge we'll
          never know.

                         GORT
          Well, maybe that's the point, isn't it?
          (beat; out of the blue)
          I feel funny. Queer almost.

                         NION
          Queer. Since when?

                         GORT
          How's your gout?
          Nion rubs his leg.

                         NION
          Better.
          Gort's look goes from Nion to Snow White.

                         GORT
          You don't think it has anything to do
          with...

                         NION
          How much have you had to drink?!
          The huntsman drains the last few drops of his rum when BEITH
          approaches, sitting beside him gruffly.

                         BEITH
          Fleecing us of all our rum, eh huntsman?

                         ERIC
          What do you say, we let bygones be bygones?

                         BEITH
          Not yet, nut-hook. What's in it for you?
          (off Eric's innocent expression)
          I'm talking about the girl? Is it really
          just the gold?

          I'm not sure, Beith. If I had any sense I'd
          have abandoned her long ago.
          Beith eyes Eric as he watches Snow White dance.

                         BEITH
          Muir says she's destined. Question is,
          huntsman, for whom?
          Gus and Snow White are still dancing.

                         GUS
          (As Snow White treads on his toes)
          You don't mind me saying, you got two left
          feet for a princess.

                         SNOW WHITE
          I don't mind at all, Gus. I haven't danced
          in a long, long while.
          She feels eyes on her - turns to see the huntsman watching her
          with a slight smile. She smiles back and breaks away.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Do you mind, Gus?

                         GUS
          Not at all.
          Snow White walks over to the Huntsman, holds out her hand.

                         SNOW WHITE
          You've taught me to fight, surely I can
          teach you to dance.
          Eric trades a look with Beith, who nudges him on. Eric
          stands and they proceed to dance, with her teaching.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Palms up, head straight, look me in the
          eyes. And...
          The huntsman moves better than you'd imagine. His face even
          softens as they both enjoy the dance.
          Beith looks on with a smile.

          131 EXT. STONE RUINS/ GROVE/ ENCHANTED FOREST - DAWN. 131

          Eric and the dwarves are asleep. Flowers have grown around them,
          as if they've been asleep for months.
          Cull and Duir sleep sitting up, back to back, at the ready.

                         (CONTINUED)

          Muir, also awake and smiling, sits against the log, his hand
          rubbing his son's sleeping head.
          Snow White sits amazed, drinking in the sights and sounds.
          Animals emerge from the forest -- SQUIRRELS, BEAVERS, FOXES,
          BIRDS. Slowly they make their way towards the ruins, gazing at
          Snow White.

          THE NIGHT SHIMMERS WITH FAIRY LIGHT AS THEY OBSERVE HER.
          Snow White feels the light on her face and to her surprise, she
          sees the two MAGPIES who watched over her at the castle. Two
          BEAUTIFUL FAIRIES WITH THE DEER EYES slip out of the magpies'
          bodies, beaming at her.
          As Snow White sits up, they direct her to the woods WHERE A
          DAZZLING LIGHT SHINES THROUGH A TREE. As she walks animals fall
          in alongside her.
          A little way away, Gus snores in his sleep. The golden light
          crosses his face and he wakes up. As he opens his eyes, he
          stares in wonder, then quickly wakes the other dwarves.
          They all stare in amazement now, even the blind MUIR. Eric is
          the last to wake up, wondering what the fuss is all about.
          They rise and follow to --

          AT THE TREE
          She stands BENEATH THE GIANT TREE, facing a MAJESTIC WHITE HART.
          The air around the mystical creature shimmers with a golden
          light.

                         BEITH
          No one's ever seen it before.
          The excited Muir grabs his son Quert by the arm.

                         QUERT
          The white hart bows before the princess,
          father.
          Sure enough, the HART lowers its head before Snow White. Muir's
          face is lit up in the golden light, his blind eyes shining.

                         MUIR
          It's blessing her.

                         ERIC
          What are you talking about?

                         MUIR
          You have eyes, huntsman, but do not see.
          You who have been with her the longest.
          Eric doesn't understand.

          She is the one.

                         GORT
          So you're saying she is destined?...
          Muir can only shake his head.

                         MUIR
          No one listens to me.

                         (BEAT)
          Can't you feel it? Are you ailments not
          gone? Gold or no gold, where she leads I
          follow.

                         GUS
          Aye!
          The other Dwarves trade looks. Nion, the last, shrugs.
          As Snow White strokes the hart's neck, the golden light
          brightens, engulfing her.

          -- SUDDENLY AN ARROW FLIES THROUGH THE AIR -- AND PIERCES THE

          WHITE HART'S FLANK.
          The HART roars in pain and bolts. The fairies and animals
          scatter in all directions now, their sanctuary violated.
          Eric looks up to see ALDAN the Yakut emerging through the trees
          on horseback, notching another arrow to his bow.
          A FIERCE WIND rips through the sanctuary now, shadows spreading
          where there was once light. Eric sees FINN appear on horseback,
          looking like a demon god in the gathering darkness.
          The huntsman grabs his axe. So do the dwarves, pulling on their
          battle masks.
          WILLIAM emerges through the trees to see ALDAN aiming his bow at
          Snow White. He rides into the Yakut's horse, knocking him off
          balance just as he fires --
          The arrow narrowly misses Snow White, thudding into a tree. Gus
          grabs her by the hand.

                         GUS
          Come on!
          He runs with her into the forest.
          Aldan turns on William furiously, drawing his curved sword, but
          before he can swing the dwarves attack both men --
          Eric only has eyes for Finn. They stare at each other in the
          roaring wind, then Finn gallops into the forest after-Snow White
          Eric RUNS in the same direction --

          William fends off the furious dwarf attack then rides off in
          pursuit of snow white --
          Aldan sees him but is too busy defending himself against COLL
          and DUIR to give chase --

          132 EXT. ENCHANTED FOREST - DAY. 132

          All around the forest the shadow of death is spreading. Gus
          runs, dragging Snow White behind him. Galloping through the
          trees, WILLIAM spots them up ahead, riding faster.

          133 EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE ENCHANTED FOREST - DAY. 133

          Bow and arrow at the ready, Eric runs after Finn. All around him
          the forest is darkening. He follows the sound of galloping
          hooves when suddenly they stop. He stops too, notching an arrow
          to his bow, peering into the gloom and listening.
          There's a tense silence, then SUDDENLY HE HEARS A NOISE. He
          spins around, ready to fire, when he sees it's only Finn's
          riderless horse galloping past --
          He realizes too late that it's a trick -- FINN EXPLODES OUT OF
          THE DARKNESS, catching him a glancing blow with his sword --

          134 EXT. STONE RUINS/ GROVE/ ENCHANTED FOREST - DAY. 134

          Coll and Duir leap up at Aldan, trying to drag him off his
          horse, but he's a ferocious fighter, driving them both back --

          135 EXT. ENCHANTED FOREST - DAY. 135

          William spots Snow White up ahead. She disappears into the
          trees and he rides faster. She erupts from behind a branch and
          pulls him off his horse. Gus races over and raises his axe --

                         SNOW WHITE
          Gus, no!
          Gus's axe stops inches from William's eyes. Snow White
          recognizes the young warrior, staring at him in surprise.

                         SNOW WHITE
          I saw you at the village.
          William looks up at her, out of breath:

                         WILLIAM
          It's me. William.
          Snow White stares in disbelief, tears of surprise welling in her
          eyes. Gus looks even more confused, lowering his axe.
          William slowly rises to his feet, gazing back at Snow White,
          when THEY HEAR A TWIG SNAP --
          Gus hears it too, spinning around --

          PRINCESS!
          Gus launches himself -- and takes the arrow meant for Snow
          White. Before Aldan can load another arrow -- William fires an
          arrow of his own, striking him in the chest. The Yakut topples
          over, dead at last but still astride his horse.
          Snow White falls to her knees in anguish, cradling the dying
          Gus. He smiles weakly, holding her gaze, then whispers:

                         GUS
          I shan't leave you, Miss.

          136 EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE ENCHANTED FOREST - DAY. 136

          Eric charges into Finn with a cry of rage. Finn deflects the
          blow and hurls him back into the trees. Driven by fury, Eric
          charges again, but Finn uses his anger against him, ducking
          under the vicious blow and landing a brutal one of his own --
          Eric crashes into another tree. His eyes are still full of
          hatred but his body is weak. Finn smiles in contempt from a few
          yards away.

                         FINN
          I captured many girls, but your wife was
          special.

                         ERIC
          What?!

                         FINN
          She fought and then she begged. For her
          life. Please?!!! You should know she
          called for you. Your Sara.

                         ERIC
          How do you know her name?!
          Eric is shocked, desperate.

                         FINN
          She told me. Just before I slit her
          throat.

                         -ERIC
          Bastard... .-
          Eric notices a fallen TREE TRUNK behind Finn -- dead branches
          STICKING UP LIKE SPIKES. Finn steps toward him...

                         FINN
          Now you can look for her in the other world
          and beg for her forgiveness.

          Finn smiles and raises his sword for the death blow -- when ERIC
          LUNGES. He throws himself at Finn, his momentum carrying them
          both into THE DEAD TREE'S SPIKED BRANCHES --
          The branches pierce Finn's body, their tips digging into Eric's
          flesh. Finn howls in agony --

          Finn writhes, fighting to pull himself free of the branches but
          Eric holds him down, even as the spikes dig into him, forcing
          Finn's wounds to stay open - unable to heal.

                         FINN

          141 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY. 141

           Ravenna sits at her desk - she is small and alone in the 
           vastness of the hall.
           She stares off into space, a quill in her hand - parchments laid
           out before her.
           Then suddenly her body convulses - the bottle of black ink 
           spills - dark tendrils of liquid seep across the papers and onto 
           the floor. 

                          RAVENNA
           Finn ...no! 
           She falls to the floor - writhing. 
           She fights hard at first - but then begins to weaken - her 
           power fades as she ages. 
           Then she stops. 

                         RAVENNA
          Forgive me, brother.

          142 ENCHANTED FOREST - DAY. 142
          Finn gasps as he feels Ravenna cut him off. Reacts in horror and
          heartbreak as his wounds stop trying to heal.

                         FINN
          Sister...
          Finn twitches for a moment, looks to Eric.

                         FINN
          I feel...
          Then the light goes out of his eyes. He is finally dead.
          Slowly, Eric pulls himself free of the branches cutting into his
          flesh.

           She has broken their connection. We pull away from her. 
           Ravenna's head is down, depleted, forlorn. Completely still. 
           Ink pools around her bony hands. But when she raises her head -- 
          We see conviction, hatred and determination.

          Still bleeding from his wounds, Eric hurries back through the
          forest until he sees Snow White and the seven dwarves gathered
          around Gus's body, chanting a low prayer. Eric stares in
          surprise, then notices William.

                         ERIC
          Who is this?
          Beith is about to reply when William answers for himself.

                         WILLIAM
          My name is William. I am Duke Hammond's
          son.

                         (BEAT)

          the Queen's men?

                         WILLIAM
          I was looking for the princess.

                         ERIC
          Why?

                         WILLIAM
          To protect her.

                         ERIC
          The princess is well protected as you can
          see.

                         WILLIAM
          And who are you?

                         ERIC
          The man who got her this far your lordship.

                         WILLIAM
          I'm grateful for your help but I will take
          her from here.

                         ERIC
          You'll have to wait for your voice to break
          before you give me orders -
          William draws his sword in indignation and Eric draws his axe.

          Anyone can draw steel, boy. It takes a man
          to use it.
          William is about to react when Snow White turns...

                         SNOW WHITE
          Leave him, huntsman. He's our friend.
          He glares but his eyes glisten with tears. Snow White is
          still bowed over Gus's body, sobbing, mourning.
          The prayer chant ends. Nion spits with anger and walks away.

                         NION
          We need to convene.
          They all follow him a few steps away, where they have
          privacy.

                         BEITH
          What is it, Nion?

                         NION
          This is what happens when dwarves mix
          with men. We always come out worse. We
          have big hearts and we'll fight for any
          cause -- but for what? For some new Queen
          to call us runts and turn us out of our
          homes again?

                         GORT
          I've nothing against the girl, but I'm
          not willing to risk my life for her
          either, like poor Gus.
          Beith considers quietly, the other dwarves listening too.

                         DUIR

          Even our own legends speak of the
          redeemer who will heal the land.

          have tried to defeat the Queen and
          failed. Why not a mutton?
          The dwarves stare at him incredulously.

          Gus lost his life because of her!

                         MUIR
          No. He gave his life for her. As will I
          if necessary. Look at us. Look at what
          we've become.
          They trade looks. They know where he's going with this.

                         MUIR
          We were once proud, now we pilfer and
          drink and dream of when we didn't. I am
          willing to die for a chance at becoming
          the man I once was.
          And that is the last word. Quert puts his arm around his
          father and kisses his forehead. Beith and Gort trade a nod

          fairies to be seen. It's as if Ravenna's shadow has passed
          here too. The tough, battle hardened dwarves shed tears like
          children. Snow White looks heartbroken as Beith lights the

          I'm sorry I left you.
          She looks over and sees the remorse in his eyes.

          You didn't.

          White his hand. She takes it and he helps her up the slope.

          We shared a childhood together, before she
          was taken away. She hasn't changed. She has

          William smiles back gently and whispers...

                         WILLIAM
          Walk with me.
          They walk into the silver birches.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Up here it's as if nothing's changed. The
          world looks beautiful again.

                         WILLIAM
          It will be. When you are Queen.
          Snow White turns, surprised by his words.

                         WILLIAM
          The people of this kingdom hate Ravenna
          with their very fiber.

                         SNOW WHITE
          It's strange, but... I feel only sorrow
          for her.
          William is taken aback by this but pushes on.

                         WILLIAM
          Once people find out you're alive they
          will rise up in your name.
          Snow White stares back at him uncertainly.

                         SNOW WHITE
          It takes more than a name. I an not my
          father, William.

                         WILLIAM
          You are his daughter. And rightful heir.

          He steps closer, gazing into her eyes devotedly.

                         WILLIAM
          If I had a choice, I would take you far
          from here. And keep you safe by my side.
          But I have a duty. And so do you.
          They hold each other's gaze, Snow White still ridden with
          doubt.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         SNOW WHITE
          How do I inspire? How do I lead men?

                         WILLIAM
          The same way you led me when we were
          children. I followed you everywhere. Ran
          when you called. I would have done
          anything for you.
          She looks touched by his words, smiling softly, trying to
          make light of them.

                         SNOW WHITE
          That's not how I remember it.

                         WILLIAM
          No?

                         SNOW WHITE
          No...
          They gaze into each other's eyes, close enough to kiss.

                         SNOW WHITE
          I remember we were always arguing. And
          fighting. And...
          She trails off, lost in his gaze. He stops, leans closer and
          kisses her gently. They stay like that a moment, then William
          pulls away, holding something in his hand. Snow White smiles
          as she sees that it's an APPLE.
          With a mischievous smile, William holds out the apple for
          Snow White, just like he did when they were children.

                         SNOW WHITE
          I remember this trick.

                         WILLIAM
          (With mock innocence)
          What trick?
          Snow White holds his gaze, then snatches the apple from him
          before he can take a bite, raising it to her lips with a
           smile. As she bites --

          struggling to breathe --

          Eric stands up, looks around, dwarves still asleep. He shakes

          They walk into the trees and follow --

          A SINGLE SET OF TRACKS.
          150g EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAWN. 150g
          Snow White staggers back and collapses in the snow, choking
          from poison. Her eyes water and her vision blurs. The false
          William kneels beside her and slowly she sees Ravenna's
          features burning through, her cold blue eyes gleaming in

                         TRIUMPH --
          A SCREAM fills the air -- not Snow White but dozens of birds
          shrieking in the sky above --

          Snow White's limbs are petrified, frost spreading across her
          cheeks -- but her eyes are open, taking in everything.
          Ravenna leans over her, smiling.

                         RAVENNA
          You see, child, love always betrays us.
          A sigh escapes Snow White's lips, condensing into steam.

                         RAVENNA
          By fairest blood it was done and only by
          fairest blood can it be undone. You- were
          the only one who could break the-spell
          and end my life, and the only one pure
          enough to save me.
          She draws away, unwrapping her sacramental dagger.

                         RAVENNA
          You don't realize how lucky you are,
          never to know what it is to grow old.

          She raises the knife, about to cut out Snow White's heart -

          WHEN SUDDENLY HER BODY SHATTERS INTO A FLOCK OF SHRIEKING

                         RAVENS --
          And now we see the HUNTSMAN STANDING THERE, AXE IN HAND, THE

          RAVENS FLAPPING AROUND HIM --
          William blasts with a sword at the screeching birds --
          Eric goes after her now, swinging his twin hatchets. The
          ravens scream and pluck at his eyes but he hacks at them
          fiercely, William joining in, until the shrieking birds
          finally take to the sky and vanish on the horizon.
          Eric and William rush to Snow White's side now. The dwarves
          arrive too, hurrying through the snow.
          William cradles Snow White in his arms, trying to revive her,
          but it's no use. Eric stares in dismay as he sees the poison
          drain the color from her lips. He kneels down and gazes at
          her. William turns to the dwarves.

                         WILLIAM
          What are you looking at? Help her!
          The dwarves stare back at him gravely but don't respond. He's
          desperate now, irrational --

                         WILLIAM
          You are dwarves, healers, save her!
          He grabs the blind seer, MUIR, shaking him.

                         WILLIAM
          Do something!
          Muir stares back at him with his empty eyes, tears glistening
          in them.
          William collapses in prayer, the light in Snow White's eyes
          almost gone. Eric looks over, sees William's grief is as
          great as his own, and finally stops fighting.
          Snow White looks up at William as if she wants to say
          something, then the light in her eyes goes out.
          The dwarves are heartbroken. Eric looks dazed.
          William leans down and kisses Snow White gently on the lips.
          He pulls away,.hoping against hope. And then --
          Nothing happens. She lies there, lifeless and white as the
          falling snow.
          On all the faces - realizing that she is truly gone.

          A flock of ravens whips across the sky, swooping into --

          161 INT. MIRROR ROOM - DAY. 161

          The ravens burst into the mirror room and "crash" to the
          ground. Their swirl becomes --
          Ravenna, on all fours, looking worse for wear, surrounded by
          dead ravens. The effort depleted her. She GROWLS as she
          crawls toward the mirror.

                         RAVENNA
          What must I do?! Where is she?! Where
          have they taken her?! Answer me!
          The mirror just REFLECTS RAVENNA'S weary and aging face.

                         RAVENNA

          ANSWER ME!!!!
          Nothing. Ravenna releases it all, looks up and quietly
          pleads...

          grovelling desperation. You sicken me, my

          She died for us! For our cause! We cannot
          hide behind these walls and watch this
          land die with her!

                         DUKE HAMMOND
          Your grief clouds your judgement, my son.

          Here you are. Where it ends. Dressed Up
          to pretty.
          He takes another pull from the flask.

                         ERIC
          Like you're asleep; about to wake-up and
          give me more grief. Am I right?
          The he touches her arm. Feels the fabric of her funeral
          dress. Looks at her face and breaks a bit - losing the
          drunken swagger and speaking with her as if she was still
          alive.

                         ERIC
          You deserved better.
          And then he answers her...

                         ERIC
          She was my wife, princess. That was your
          question that went unanswered. Sara was
          her name. When I came back from the wars
          I carried with me the stench of death and
          the anger of the lost. I wasn't worth
          saving. But she did so anyway. I loved
          her more than anything or anyone. And
          then I let her out of my sight and she
          was gone and I became myself again. A
          self I never cared for. Until you. You
          remind me of her. Her spirit. Her
          heart. And now you, too, are gone. You
          both deserved better. And I'm sorry to
          have failed you as well.

          You will be a Queen in heaven now...
          He leans down and kisses her lips.

          And sit among the angels.
          He finally turns and leaves the chamber, tossing the flask
          aside, disgusted with himself.
          As we listen to his footsteps fade we hold on Snow White's
          beautiful face. For a long time she stays perfectly still,

          Open the gate.

          PERCY (O.S.)

          Eric stops. He's been recognized. Percy catches up to him.
          They share a look and Eric sighs.

                         PERCY
          Yes, I recognized you.
          Eric sighs.

          We have no quarrel with you. Not anymore.
          You returned the princess to us. And for
          that...
          He hands over a heavy sack of gold. Eric takes it, weighs it
          in his hand. God does he need it, but...

          My duty is to protect the people who come
          to me for help. I will defend them with
          my last drop of blood but I will not
          abandon these walls. I cannot afford to
          believe in miracles.
          He suddenly stops as the SHOUTS outside the tent get louder.
          He goes to the flap, opens it to see --
          Snow White , still dressed in her white funeral robes, stands
           at the top of the stairs that leads down into the courtyard.
          171a EXT. COURTYARD - DUKE HAMMOND'S CASTLE 171a
          Everyone comes out of their tents and stands beneath Snow
          White. Her heart pounding, she makes her way down the
          stairs. All are riveted by the sight of her, as if they're
          looking on an angel or a living miracle.
          Eric makes his way back into the courtyard and he, too, is
          stunned as he slides in next to the dwarves in the crowd.

                         BEITH
          It's a miracle!
          Duke Hammond, embarrassed and still stunned by the sight of
          her, walks up the stairs to greet her. Several Generals
          follow him but stay a few steps below them. Hammond takes
          her by the hands as they speak.

                         DUKE HAMMOND
          Your highness...
          (He can't believe his eyes)
          We thought you...

                         SNOW WHITE
          No, my lord.
          William, below, stares at her in joy while his father still
          looks dazed.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         DUKE HAMMOND
          You must rest -

                         SNOW WHITE
          I have rested long enough.
          Her voice is gentle but full of quiet conviction.

                         SNOW WHITE
          I am ready to ride by your side, my lord,
          when you face the Queen in battle.
          The Duke looks speechless for a moment.

                         DUKE HAMMOND
          There will be no battle, your highness.
          The best thing you can do for your people
          is stay safe behind these walls.

                         SNOW WHITE
          That is all I thought to do when I
          escaped. But I have come to learn there
          is no peace while others suffer. Have you
          not learned that?

                         DUKE HAMMOND
          The Queen cannot be defeated. She cannot
          be killed. And therefore there can be no
          victory.
          Snow White hesitates, her heart pounding, then replies:

                         SNOW WHITE
          I can vanquish her. Defeat her. I am the
          only one. She told me so herself.
          Duke Hammond starts to object, but Snow White's eyes and, now
          her feet, lead her down the stairs to her people. When she
          reaches the last step - now at their level - she speaks...

                         SNOW WHITE
          I have been told that I represent you,
          that it is my place to inspire you. That
          is wronct. I am not a Queen, not a
          leader, not a warrior.
          Absolute silence in the courtyard as people, lords, knights
          hang on her every word.

                         SNOW WHITE
          You represent me, who I've become - your
          hopes,: your courage, your will - inspires
          me.

                         (BEAT)
          I have also been told my place is not to
          fight but to stay here, safely behind
          these walls. I will not.

          I hold life sacred, even more since I've
          tasted freedom, but I've lost my fear of
          death.

          Heads nod, people murmur approval. She has them in the palm
          of her hand.

                         SNOW WHITE
          If Ravenna comes for me, I will ride to
          meet her. And if she doesn't, I will ride
          to meet her.
          (looks back at Generals)
          Alone if I must.
          (back to people)
          But if you would join me, I will gladly
          give my life for you. For this land and
          its people have lost too much.
          Eric and the dwarves couldn't look prouder.
          Duke Hammond stares at her for a moment, then BOWS. A beat,
          then William follows, then all the Lords and Knights. His
          eyes fixed on Snow White, Eric bows too. Then Beith. Then
          Muir and his son, Quert. Then Coll and Duir. And finally even
          Gort and Nion.
          Snow White stands alone, overwhelmed by the faith of the
          kneeling warriors, and the responsibility on her shoulders.
          171b INT. MIRROR CHAMBER - ROYAL PALACE - NIGHT. 171b
          Ravenna raises her head to look into the mirror.

                         MIRROR MAN
          Yes, my Queen! Yes!!!!
          The Mirror Man laughs because Ravenna's face is younger, her
          energy has returned and we see why when --
          WE PULL BACK to reveal several CRONES, young only minutes
          before, now old and lying on the floor.
          Ravenna smiles, girding herself for the fight to come.

          The army is amassed and ready to leave the gates. Snow White,
          in full armor, sits astride a white horse, her coat of chain
          mail glittering in the torchlight. She looks like an angel,
          bearing her fathers standard.
          Eric rides up next to her. She is happy to see him.

          soldier.
          She smiles, moved. He turns his horse to full back, but
          before he leaves...

                         ERIC

          The Duke's army pours out of the great gate, their torches
          blazing in the night. From above, it looks like a river of
          lava coursing through the valley. Duke Hammond roars at the
          top of his. voice, urging his riders on, and now we see their
          vengeful fire spreading across the plain.

          178 EXT. QUEEN'S BALCONY - ROYAL PALACE - NIGHT. 178

          Ravenna and the general on the balcony. All around, soldiers
          and Guards scurry to look busy lest they draw her wrath
          (though some can't help but notice her aging appearance.
          Ravenna sweeps away a map held out to her.

          Horses crest the hill. And now, all around Snow White, we see
          her army -- not just Duke Hammond's men -- but REBELS --
          PEASANTS -- WOMEN -- all willing to follow her.
          Eric and William ride nearby. One of the Duke's commanders
          arrives to brief him.

                         DUKE'S COMMANDER
          My lord, we only have a few hours before
          the tide comes in. Not long enough to
          breach the castle walls. We'll either be
          completely exposed or drowned by the ocean.

          An unmistakable brown sludge pours out of a sewage tunnel
          into the sea. It is the same sewers where Snow White escaped.
          We hear the sound of splashing oars and grumbling:

          FROM INSIDE THE SEWAGE TUNNEL
          We look out at the faces of the dwarves, peering inside.

                         NION
          We're promised gold and volunteer for

          Ravenna stares out. On the distant cliffs she sees the banners
          of the rebel army. A ray of sunlight pours through the clouds,
          lighting up the tiny figure of Snow White.

          Coll and Duir wade through the sewage, their axes held up in

          Duke Hammond considers, then raises his sword. Snow white
          glances at the huntsman. He breaks rank and rides closer to her.
          There's a tense silence, then the Duke BRINGS DOWN HIS SWORD and
          his riders charge down the dunes.

          The trap door in the courtyard rises and we see Beith's head pop
          up, his expert eyes scanning the courtyard until they spot the
          portcullis. Ravenna's guards hurry past without seeing him,
          taking their positions on the battlements. Beith slips back down
          into the sewer.

          Snow White rides across the dunes. All around her, riders gallop
          along the surf, waves crashing around them. Ravenna's castle
          comes into the view, the portcullis still down.

          Coll and Duir move stealthily through the busy courtyard, so

          artillery men load missiles onto their trebuchets.

          Snow White suddenly sees tiny dots of firelight on the castle
          walls. Eric realizes what they are and rides faster. The
          pinpoints of light soar up in the air, growing larger and
          brighter, until we realize they're FIERY MISSILES. Eric forces
          Snow White's horse out of the way as a fireball explodes yards
          from her.

          rallying the men and riding on.

          190 EXT. GATEHOUSE - DAWN. 190

          Two unsuspecting guards collapse outside the gatehouse. Before
          the other guards can react, Coll and Duir are on them, moving
          fast and hard, the assault over in seconds.

          191 EXT. SEWER MANHOLE/ COURTYARD - DAWN. 191

          Come on!

          192 EXT. BEACH - DAWN. 192

          Waves crash over the rocks. Fireballs explode in the sand. Snow
          White sees men falling all around her, tears welling in her
          eyes, but she never falters. As William rides on, he sees the
          castle walls through the smoke, the portcullis still down.

          193 INT. GATEHOUSE -- DAWN. 193

          The GUARDS in the gatehouse look over as the door splinters and
          the dwarves come crashing through in their battle masks. Even
          though they're outnumbered, the seven fight like demons -- until
          the enemy are subdued.

          194 EXT. BEACH -- DAWN. 194

          On the castle walls, archers replace the trebuchets. Snow White
          holds up her shield to protect herself from the sea of arrows.
          Up ahead, the portcullis is still down, Duke Hammond's forces
          circling back as they're trapped against the walls.

                         WILLIAM
          You must turn back!

                         SNOW WHITE
          I gave my word I would stand with them!

          195 INT. GATEHOUSE -- DAWN. 195

          A huge pulley controls the portcullis. Beith, Gort and Nion draw
          their pickaxes while Coll and Duir tie up the guards.

                         BEITH
          Now let's see how this works! --
          With a mighty blow of his axe, Beith shatters the chains holding
          up the pulley. The counter weights go flying down and the
          portcullis comes shooting up -- then suddenly stops -- JAMMED.

          196 EXT. BEACH -- DAWN. 196

          The Duke's army are still circling the gates, stones and hot oil
          pouring down on them from above. Arrows slam into Snow White's
          shield but she still refuses to retreat.

          197 INT. GATEHOUSE -- DAWN. 197

          Beith peers down at the jammed counter-weights in frustration
          when he hears a fierce cry. GORT jumps on the counter-weight,
          trying to bring it down. Nion follows, yellingatthetopofhis
          voice. Duir puffs up his proud chest and leapsontoo--

          198 EXT. BEACH -- DAWN. 198

          Snow White sees the portcullis shoot up now, the dwarves hanging
          onto the counterweights for dear life. Smiling in relief, she
          gallops through the open gates with Eric and William.

          199 EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD -- DAWN. 199

          The Duke's riders charge into the courtyard. ARCHERS fire at
          them from every corner of the castle, but they raise their
          shields and leap off their horses, forming a defensive wedge.

          200 EXT. BALCONY/ RAVENNA'S CASTLE - DAY. 200

          From her balcony above the portcullis, Ravenna watches her own
          men being slaughtered; she enjoys the spectacle (Ravenna does
          not care one bit about those men). Her eyes are locked on Snow
          White.

                         RAVENNA
          Let her come to me...ALIVE!
          Ravenna's soldiers are merely there to hold Snow White's army
          back. She has planned the whole thing, calculated every move.

          Like a spider waiting in her web, with no concern about her
          soldiers' situation, Ravenna remains calm and calculated.
          Ravenna turns around and leaves the balcony to the throne
          room.

          SNOW WHITE rushes into the castle. As soon as she passes the

          Snow White storms into the throne room. She is breathing
          heavily, a mix of fear and determination.

          KNOCK... KNOCK... KNOCK
          The raven claw ring, taps, resonating through the halls.
          Ravenna stands at the top of the stairs, the mirror room 
          behind her. 
          Snow White approaches. 

                         SNOW WHITE

                          RAVENNA
           I'll show you thorns!
           In a terrifying tremor, the black ceiling of the throne room 
           starts to shatter into millions of shards. 
          Snow White turns back to see William, Eric and Hammond's men - 
          the shards fall down like razor blades. 
          The men try to protect themselves. Some are caught out and 
          skewered to the stone floor. Ravenna looks down at them in 
          complete satisfaction. 

                          
          The millions of black shards circle around Eric and his men, 
          completely blocking them and keeping them away from Snow
          White.

                         RAVENNA
          Come! ... Avenge your father, who was too
          weak to raise his sword.
          The millions of shards assemble themselves into three seven 
          foot tall, razor sharp creatures. The DARK FAERIES: Ravenna's 
          ultimate soldiers.
          Snow White looks at Eric and William - unable to help her.

          Eric, William and the other men are completely surrounded by
          these creatures; they move so fast. Eric tries to step away
          from them... to no avail.
          One of the creatures rises in front of William.
          William tries to slash the creature.
          His sword goes through and the creature reforms itself right
          away. The Dark Faerie opens it's mouth and screeches.
          William gets smashed aside, saved only by his shield. The 
          Dark Faerie grabs the soldier right behind William and sends
          him crashing into the wall. 
          Snow White walks up the stairs, torn and powerless.
          She looks at Eric one last time. 
          Eric looks back as he fights off a Dark Faerie with his two 
          shields. He knows he does not have much time left but he is
          ready to make the final sacrifice.

                         ERIC
          (battle cry!)
          Kill her!
          209b INT. MIRROR CHAMBER - DAY. 209b
          Snow White braces herself and promptly follows Ravenna into
          the mirror room. Now Snow White is exactly where Ravenna
          wants her to be.
          The two women circle each other like heavyweight boxers.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Ten years you locked me away!
          Ravenna seems to relish this. 

                         RAVENNA
          And every day, every hour led you to this
          ,moment. It burned inside you. It drove
          you forward, and here you are..
          Listening only to her heart, Snow White lunges towards 
          Ravenna and tries - strikes at her with her sword.
          Ravenna steps aside and with very little effort - throws her 
          to the other side of the room.

                         RAVENNA
          That's it. Fight. Fight for your land...

          Snow White slams and slides across the floor, she stops under
          the archway at the top of the stairs. She is dazed. 
          Ravenna treads on her back, then grabs her hair, pulls her 
          head up to see William and his men being massacred. 

                         RAVENNA

          Eric is trying to stay alive. He rams a Faerie into a pillar.
          Shredding the stone, the Faerie explodes in shards and
          reforms immediately behind Eric.
          Grabbing the first man in sight, the Faerie throws the poor
          soldier to the other side of the room.
          on the opposite side another Faerie slides faster than the
          blink of an eye, grabs the man in flight extending it's
          cutting limbs and claws the soldier to his death.
          It is like carnage in slow motion.

          William is being overrun by a school of shards. The shards
          shape up into a Faerie taking William up high. In a violent
          arm blow, the Faerie projects William onto the banquet table
          six feet lower. The table shatters in splinters, William
          bouncing like a rag doll.
          Spinning around on it's way down, the Faerie skewers a
          soldier and impales another one into a pillar. The Faerie
          drags him ten feet up, tearing and digging deep into the
          stone column.

           Enraged, Snow White jolts her body and frees herself from 
          Ravenna's grasp.
          She swings her sword at Ravenna. She parries every attack 
          with her bare hands.
          Snow White is breathless. One more strike... but Ravenna
          blocks it again, and this time she doesn't let go.

          Snow White struggles to get out of her lock. Ravenna is too
          strong.
          Snow White's wrist is twisted. She holds her sword tight but
          can't use it. Ravenna forces the twist. Her fragile bones
          crack. 
          Snow White screams in pain.
          The sword drops on the ground.

          Ravenna back hands Snow White, sending her crashing to the
          wall. SLAM! Cuts on her face. 
          Ravenna looms closer, through the fire in the middle of the 
          room. She stands IN the fire, unaffected.
          For Snow White it is a vision of pure hell. So much power, so
          much hate.

          Ravenna's laughter pierces Snow White like a dagger. 
          She feels powerless and lost, spitting blood and exhausted. 
          What else can she do?

          William, stumbling upon the dead bodies of his comrades, sees
          the shards starting to obstruct the entry of the mirror room.
          He runs towards it. Eric sees him and goes for it too.
          Behind William and in front of Eric, a Dark creature shapes
          up. William doesn't see it.
          The Faerie claws William from behind through his armor,
          stopping him still and sending him backwards against a pillar
          like a stone ricochet.
          The Faerie spins it's head 180 degrees and goes from turning
          its back to Eric... to facing the huntsman.
          Eric stops and tries to pull back.
          The Faerie powers up gathering shards from another creature,
          doubling in size and density.
          Like a fire hose of black shards, the Dark Faerie unloads a
          stream of razor blades at Eric.
          Eric digs his heels in... slowly grinds and slides on the
          floor, double shields up.
          The shields are being shredded. One shield gives way
          completely torn slicing Eric's arm.
          Eric has one shield left. He kneels down... it is a matter of

          still too far.
          Ravenna straddles Snow White, raises her dagger above her
          head - smiling, relishing the imminent death blow. The black
          tomb has closed in around them.

          NO! 
          She pulls out the dagger, her face starts to age. 
          Ravenna is aging at an incredible pace. Her body gives way
          and she slumps to the floor, below the mirror. 
          She looks at the mirror above her, gasping, reaching out, her 
          pale eyes looking for a friend, a miracle... but nothing. 
          The black shards that entombed the room start to shatter and 
          fall to the floor.

          214 INT. THRONE ROOM - SAME - DAY. 214

          William is on the ground, out of strength and has given up
          the fight. A dark creature is slowly close to reaching
          William's face with his sharp claws as William tries to hold
          the creature's arm with his bare hands, severely bleeding.

          The Faeries have slowed down dramatically. Eric grabs a sword
          on the ground and slices the Faerie in front of him... the
          Faerie shatters.
          William looks at Eric, in desperation begging for help. The
          two men lock eyes. A silent understanding.

          Eric throws his sword and blows the other Dark Faerie in
          pieces, releasing William.
          A silent pact has been made at this moment between the two
          men.
          The remaining Dark Creature freezes. Eric and William are
          barely alive.

          215 INT. MIRROR CHAMBER - DAY. 215

          Snow White approaches Ravenna and kneels beside her, Ravenna
          is weak. She ages dozens of years within seconds, her face
          shows no anger, no hate, just a strange understanding.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Why this? Why all of this?

                          
          Snow White, overwhelmed by compassion, places her hand on
          Ravenna's chest. Ravenna puts her own wrinkled hand on Snow
          White's.
          Ravenna smiles. She gently taps on Snow White's... in a 
          strange and affectionate motherly way.

                          
          Eric and William, exhausted and battered climb the steps of 
          the mirror chamber. It is over. 
          Ravenna stares up at Snow White's face in a shining halo of
          light above her from the ceiling.

                         RAVENNA
          (whispering to Snow White)
          See child,... we are bound.

                         SNOW WHITE
          (whispers to Ravenna calming)
          It will be all right...
          Ravenna whispers incomprehensible words with a peaceful smile
           on her face. The clouds move in the disc of light above Snow 
           White. The light falls over Ravenna's face. 
           The light fades out of her eyes and she dies.

           In the cloister gardens, a blossom flowers on the apple tree and
           the world is born again --

           In death, Ravenna's beautiful blue eyes are wide open, fixed on
           the halo of light that surrounds Snow White's head.

                          SNOW WHITE
           Backlit in a golden hue. A crown is placed on her head.
           We're in...
          Packed for the coronation. Duke Hammond and Bishops surround
          her. Snow White smiles and looks out at all assembled - her
          subjects, her friends, the people she's come to know and love
          - meeting the eyes of Rose, looking young and beautiful again
          -- Anna and Lily -- the seven dwarves, who all wipe away
          tears.
          She sees William off to the side, smiling, looking on
          adoringly. But her eyes continue through the crowd, looking

                         FOR --
          Eric, in the very back of the cathedral, near the door.
          Their eyes meet, as if they're the only two in the room.
          This lasts several moments until --

                         BEITH
          Hail to the Queen!
          And then the huntsman smiles and leaves.

                         ERIC V/0
          The land was healed, and the rightful Queen
          brought an age of peace and prosperity.

          223 EXT. CASTLE - DAY 223

          We drop down from the castle to find the huntsman, on horseback
          heading toward us.

          ERIC (V.0.)
          As for the huntsman...
          Eric goes under the village arch, back toward the forest.

          ERIC (V.O.)
          He returned to the forest where he
          belonged.
