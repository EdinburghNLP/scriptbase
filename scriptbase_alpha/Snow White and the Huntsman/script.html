                        Inspired by the Brothers Grimm's

                             "Little Snow White"
                      

                         

                         

                                                     November 22nd, 2011



<b>          1 EXT. GARDENS/ CASTLE - DAY. 1
</b>
          From high above we see the castle gardens covered in a blanket
          of snow. We hear the tread of footsteps then see a beautiful
          WOMAN in a fur-lined cloak heading towards an unseen object.

<b>          ERIC (V.0.)
</b>          Once upon a time, in deep winter, a Queen
          was admiring the falling snow when she saw
          a rose blooming in defiance of the cold.
          The rose looks miraculously red. Nearby, a RAVEN looks on. The
          Queen gazes at the flower, then bends down.

<b>          ERIC (V.0.)
</b>          Reaching for it, she pricked her finger and
          three drops of blood fell.
          BOOM -- with the impact of an artillery shell, a DROP OF BLOOD
          lands in the snow. Followed by ANOTHER. And ANOTHER.
          The Queen startles, then calmly touches her stomach.

<b>          ERIC (V.0.)
</b>          And because the red seemed so alive against
          the white, she thought, if only I had a
          child as white as snow, lips as red as
          blood, hair as black as a raven's wings and
          all with the strength of that rose.
          A beat, then we hear the piercing cry of a new-born baby --

<b>          2 INT. ROYAL BEDROOM - DAY. 2
</b>
          We find ourselves in a crowded chamber full of MIDWIVES and
          PHYSICIANS. Moving through the chaos we glimpse buckets of
          water, dirty sponges, astrology charts and protection charms --
          until we see a BABY GIRL in the arms of her happy mother.

<b>          ERIC (V.O.)
</b>          Soon after, a daughter was born to the
          Queen and was named "Snow White."
          With a radiant smile, the Queen offers SNOW WHITE to her proud
          father, KING MAGNUS. The baby's CRIES grow louder as the King
          cradles her gently in his arms, turning towards a mirror.

<b>          ERIC V/O
</b>          And she was adored throughout the kingdom
          as much for her defiant spirit as for her
          beauty.

<b>          3 EXT. WOODS NEAR CASTLE - DAY. 3
</b>
          A wounded MAGPIE is twitching in a puddle of water. SNOW WHITE,
          aged 7 now, steps towards it hesitantly, looking concerned.

<b>                         (CONTINUED)
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         
<b>            2
</b>
<b>                         3 CONTINUED: 3
</b>
<b>          YOUNG SNOW WHITE
</b>          Pick it up, William.
          Her companion, William, also 7, braces himself, reaches down,
          then steps back in alarm as the bird starts flapping wildly. He
          tries to cover his embarrassment by sounding knowledgeable.

<b>                         YOUNG WILLIAM
</b>          It's dying. It doesn't want to be touched.
          Snow White ignores him, approaching the bird herself. She kneels
          down, hesitates, then reaches out and strokes the magpie,
          calming its flapping before she picks it up.
          High up on a tree, ANOTHER MAGPIE looks on.

<b>          4 EXT. SEASIDE VILLAGE/ CASTLE BRIDGE - DAY 4
</b>
          SNOW WHITE runs, cupping the wounded bird in her hand, William
          dashing after her. The sun is out and the fields and forests are
          lit up in all their glory. The children sprint through a
          BEAUTIFUL SEASIDE VILLAGE -- thatched homes with flower gardens,
          HAPPY FARMERS and FAIR VILLAGE MAIDENS --

<b>          YOUNG SNOW WHITE
</b>          Hurry, William! Hurry!
          They run down the dunes, waves crashing, the sand gleaming in
          the sunlight, until they see the BEAUTIFUL CASTLE up ahead --

<b>          5 EXT. CLOISTER GARDENS/ CASTLE - DAY 5
</b>
           A single apple tree stands in the middle of the cloisters. It
           stands out. Snow White and William dash past it into the castle.

<b>                         6 OMITTED 6
</b>
<b>          7 INT. ROYAL BEDROOM - DAY. 7
</b>
          Snow White bursts into her parent's chamber. The King and Queen
          turn from the window. Two PHYSICIANS are in attendance. Snow
          White is too young and preoccupied to notice but her mother's
          smile is tinged with sadness and her father looks heartbroken.

<b>          YOUNG SNOW WHITE
</b>          We found it in the woods.
          The Queen takes the wounded magpie from Snow White. The King
          looks on sadly as she pulls a RIBBON from Snow White's hair and
          carefully binds the magpie's wing. William watches from the
          doorway, noticing how frail the Queen looks.
          The magpie's flapping gradually calms, its pain easing.

<b>                         QUEEN
</b>          It will heal in time.
          Snow White's eyes are fixed on the little bird.

<b>                         (CONTINUED)
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         
<b>            3
</b>
<b>                         7 CONTINUED: 7
</b>
<b>                         SNOW WHITE
</b>          I'll look after it.
          The King watches Snow White, hiding his sorrow behind a smile.
          So does the Queen, holding back her tears.

<b>                         QUEEN
</b>          You possess a rare beauty, my love. In
          here.
          (She touches Snow white's heart)
          Never lose it. Hold it dear. You will need
          its strength to one day become Queen.

<b>          8 EXT. CLOISTER GARDEN/ CASTLE - DAY. 8
</b>
          Snow White and William, with a small toy bow strapped to his
          back, climb the branches of the apple tree in the cloister
          gardens. William picks a DISTINCTIVE RED AND WHITE APPLE and
          offers it to Snow White.
          He makes a point of the offer, holding it out, nodding.
          Just as she comes to take it he pulls it away and takes a
          huge bite himself, grinning. Snow White shoves him off the
          tree and they fall to the ground.
          And now we PULL BACK to reveal the King and William's father,
          DUKE HAMMOND, watching from the throne room balcony.

<b>                         KING MAGNUS
</b>          My daughter will need your son's friendship
          more than ever, Duke Hammond. As will I
          yours.

<b>                         DUKE HAMMOND
</b>          We are here to serve you, your Majesty.
          As the King watches his daughter, ERIC'S VOICEOVER resumes:

<b>          ERIC (V.0)
</b>          The next winter was the harshest in memory
          and Snow White's mother passed away.
          Ba EXT. GARDENS/ CASTLE - DAY. 8a
          The garden is covered in snow but there is no red rose now. King
          Magnus walks with his arm around Snow white, heartbroken.
          A single tear rolls down Snow White's cheek. Palace onlookers
          and mourners, fixed on her face, feeling what she feels, move
          aside.

<b>          ERIC (V.0)
</b>          A year went by but the King was
          inconsolable. Taking advantage of his
          grief, dark forces gathered on the
          kingdom's borders.

                         

                         

                         

                         
<b>            4
</b>
<b>                         9 OMITTED 9
</b>
<b>          10 EXT. FOREST/ BATTLEFIELD - DAY 10
</b>
           From above we see horses movie through the forest and enter a
           clearing. At the head is --
          King Magnus, with Duke Hammond by his side, surrounded by a
          line of the King's Army. They are frozen as they look at--
          Across the battlefield - Horsemen in a line. THE RIDERS are
          silhouetted on a misty plain -- a VAST SHADOW ARMY of faceless
          warriors.
          King Magnus and the Duke trade a look -

<b>                         DUKE HAMMOND
</b>          From what hell comes this army?

<b>                         KING MAGNUS
</b>          A hell they'll soon revisit!
          King Magnus SCREAMS A BLOOD CRY, kicks his horse and rides
          forward with blind courage, no longer caring what happens to
          him.
          The two lines of warriors race, pell-mell to the center of
          the battlefield. When they meet --
          Hand to hand combat at its most brutal.
          King Magnus swings his great sword, and a SHADOW WARRIOR

<b>          SHATTERS LIKE GLASS.
</b>          All down the line the same is happening - Shadow Warriors
          shattering, evaporating.
          Strange.
          DUKE HAMMOND shatters an opponent as well and as loud and
          furious as the battlefield was only moments before, it is now
          that quiet.
          The King and the Duke watch in amazement as the rest of the
          SHADOW ARMY melts away, DISSOLVING INTO THE MORNING MIST until
          all that is left in the field is --

<b>          ERIC (V.0.)
</b>          The unholy army was defeated, leaving
          King Magnus with the spoils of victory.
          A CAGED PRISON WAGON. Odd. Not even sure how it got there.

          mighty blow of his sword shatters the lock and enters.

          Slowly, the woman turns. For a moment the King wonders if it's

          reverential, standing a few feet away.
          Ravenna's face softens as she looks at the face of Snow
          White. Ravenna beckons to her with a look and then holds out
          her arm - "Come."
          As Snow White steps forward, the handmaidens withdraw until
          only one is left, weaving beautiful flowers in Ravenna's
          hair.

<b>          ERIC V/O
</b>          And all this time, she kept Snow White in
          a cell in the north tower.
          Ravenna, in the shadows, sits perfectly still. Though it's
          been years she looks the same. The object of her gaze is --
          Snow White, who has changed. She is now a woman, lying in a
          darkened cell. Asleep.
          Around the corner, Finn secretly eyes his sister, who doesn't
          notice him.
          Ravenna, just outside the cell, doesn't blink, entranced by
          Snow White. Strange.
          Snow White opens her eyes and sees Ravenna. This is not the
          first time this has happened. Their eyes locked. Then...

<b>                         SNOW WHITE
</b>          Why?...
          Ravenna doesn't answer, just stands and walks away.

</b>          It's only as we move closer to his rugged face that we see the
          empty FLAGON OF GROG by his side and realize he's drunk. His
          eyes flicker, as a WOMAN'S SCREAM cuts through the woods.

<b>          THE SPECTRE OF A WOMAN

<b>          BACK TO SCENE - WE HEAR THE SCREAM
</b>          Eric's eyes flicker and begin to open -- then he hears it
          again.

<b>          ROSE (O.S.)
</b>          Help!!!!
          He rises to his feet unsteadily, his head pounding from a
          hangover, then grabs two THROWING HATCHETS and slides them into
          his harness on his back --

          Eric runs past trees and ducks under branches, crashing into a
          few, still drunk. As he arrives at a clearing he sees a
          beautiful girl, (ROSE), fighting off a HUGE TATTOOED WARRIOR,

<b>          (BROCH).
</b>
<b>                         ERIC
</b>          Lay a hand on her and I'll take your head!
          BROCH turns and sees the huntsman with his hatchet raised.

<b>                         BROCH
</b>          Ale given you courage again, huntsman?

<b>                         ERIC

          from here.

<b>                         BROCH
</b>          Aye, but first you'd have to see straight.
          Broch advances with a grin, drawing his own axe. Trying to clear
          his vision and steady his aim, Eric hurls the hatchet -- and
          MISSES, the blade sticking in the tree above the frightened
          Greta's head --
          Broch is on Eric in an instant, swinging his huge battle axe.
          Eric narrowly avoids the deadly blows, his natural skill and
          dexterity slowed down by all the ale he's drunk.

</b>          Rose looks on, terrified, as Broch drives Eric towards the
          trees. He corners him against an oak and swings his axe -- only
          for Eric to duck at the last moment --
          The blade buries itself deep in the tree, stuck. We realize now
          from Eric's dark smile that he lured Broch into the trap. He
          draws his second hatchet, but instead of using the blade, cracks
          Broch over the head with the handle, knocking him out.
          Rose looks on in admiration as the huntsman goes through Broch's
          pockets.

          Eric turns. Rose sees how handsome he is. Eric stares at her
          thoughtfully then approaches and gently lifts her chin,
          examining her pretty features. Rose doesn't seem to mind,
          looking back with an inviting smile.

          And now we see a RICKETY PRISON WAGON full of BEAUTIFUL GIRLS,
          just like Rose, staring out furiously from behind bars. Eric and
          a SLAVE MERCHANT haggle over Rose who is bound and gagged,
          looking just as furious as the other women.

<b>                         SLAVE MERCHANT
</b>          Her nose is on the large size and her
          chin's a little weak.

</b>          Your eyes are dim.

</b>          After all the business we've done
          together?
          Rose curses behind her gag as Eric pulls her away.

<b>                         SLAVE MERCHANT
</b>          Four gold pieces and that's my final offer!
          Eric doesn't even bother to turn around.

<b>                         ERIC
</b>          I'll peddle my wares elsewhere, thank

</b>          Ten gold pieces!
          Eric hesitates, but it's not from a guilty conscience, he's just
          considering the price. Then he smiles, turns. They have a deal.

          We get our first good look at grown Snow White as she shaves
          wood for a fire. She's done this every day for years. A

          She hears APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS. Unusual. She jumps up gets
          in her bed and pretends to sleep.
          A GUARD opens a cell opposite Snow White. A few seconds
          later the door CLANGS SHUT.
          As soon as the Guard is gone, Snow White rises, walks to her
          cell door and looks down the hall to the other cell.

          This is about as much as Ravenna can confess. Finn watches
          as she walks up the stairs to the mirror chamber. Then he
          turns and CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE. A GUARD appears and Finn
          nods.

          She turns to see --
          Finn, with Rose. Ravenna almost smiles.
          Rose holds her gaze defiantly. Ravenna walks over, admires
          her face, smiles, then takes her by the throat and --
          LIFTS HER OFF HER FEET. Rose opens her mouth to scream but
          instead of sound, ENERGY pours out. Ravenna opens her mouth,
          DEVOURING GRETA'S YOUTH AND BEAUTY. Like a flower blooming,
          her lines vanish. Like a flower wilting, Rose AGES until

          She is confused but notices --
          A roofing nail, right where the Magpies hover.
          Snow White reaches a hand out the window and touches the
          loose nail. Her fingers move it back and forth as it, bit by
          bit, breaks free.

          hyperventilates at all the air, the sky. Then she runs through
          the courtyard toward the portcullis.
          The magpies fly right into her face then away, telling her to
          follow. She does and heads straight for the small opening at
          the base of the castle wall - the entrance to the SEWERS.
          As the magpies rise, she slides on one hip, plunging into the
          darkness below. The guards follow but can't squeeze through

          gasping for air.

          MAGPIES reappear, urging her to follow them in another
          direction. She scrambles after them and sees a WHITE MARE
          waiting for her on the beach, lying on its side, allowing her to
          climb on. The mare raises itself and is away in a flash.

          boarded up.
          A group of people including children - skeletal, hungry,

          At first their approach seems harmless but as they get closer
          their faces reveal dangerous desperation and --

          Despite their concern for Snow White, the MAGPIES are also too
          afraid to enter the forest.

          Snow White hurtles through the trees, a ghostly fog rising up
          all around her, then trips over a root, landing face first in --
          A patch of LARGE MUSHROOMS that unleash CLOUDS OF POLLEN. She
          coughs, trying to fan the pollen away, but it's too late. She
          hurries on, but the hallucinations come thick and fast now --
          The trees look almost human, hooded figures peering at her
          through the haze. She sees owls without eyes. Black oil oozing
          out of tree trunks. A hanging vine reaches down and touches her
          like a hand and now she runs --
          More terrors rage at her from the swirling mist. She stumbles
          again and when she looks up vampire bats scream at her from the
          trees. Huge skeletal forms crack out of the bark, descending on
          her until she finally passes out.

          skills - as he hears the noise of cracking branches in the
          distance, he blasts away, moving like lightning.

          Snow White feels like the whole forest is pursuing her. Running
          out of breath, she hides in some bushes. As she stares into the
          mist, she sees a sinister figure appear through the haze.
          Eric stops and looks around, sensing his prey is close. Snow
          White stays low, trying to quieten her breathing.
          Eric studies the forest floor. He sees Snow White's footprints,
          then looks up at an area of disturbed undergrowth.
          Snow White peers through the bushes and sees the huntsman's
          boots approaching. She looks around for something to defend
          herself with when the sound of the footsteps fades. She can't
          see anyone now. She looks relieved when SUDDENLY STRONG HANDS

<b>          GRAB HER BY THE FEET AND DRAG HER OUT OF THE BUSHES.
</b>          She fights to get away but he pins her with a foot, reaches
          down and turns her over.
          His first look at her gives him pause. Her face, her spirit,
          her youth. She slaps at him - he pulls out his knife with
          one hand while he pins her with the other.
          Then grabs, lifts her.

          The Guards keep inching toward Eric.
          Eric, still with a knife to Snow White's throat, starts
          slowly backing up.
          Finn pulls his own sword and approaches.
          Four against one. As they burst toward him he tosses Snow
          White to the ground and in the same motion throws his knife
          into the chest of one of the Guards, who crumbles.
          Eric reaches behind, grabs both hatchets and faces off with
          the others.
          They all rush at once. Eric fights off the guards as he
          raises a hatchet, throws it --
          Right into Finn's chest. Just like Ravenna, no blood, no
          wound. Finn pulls it out, laughs and throws it at the
          huntsman who ducks as it sticks into a tree.
          Snow White, terrified, races off into the forest. They
          notice her exit but keep fighting.
          Eric fights on three sides now - holding his own until Finn
          manages to plunge a sword in his side.

          Eric covers his nose with his arm and looks at the other
          Guards, who look from Finn, who is dazed, to Eric, who is
          hurt.
          Finn struggles to his knees, shakes his head, hallucinating a

          grabs his knife out of the dead Guard, as well as his hatchet

          Snow White crashes through the woods.

          and slides down a steep slope into undergrowth.

          A single blossom flowers on the dying apple tree. Ravenna,

          blossom in her hand, turning it into ash.

          that kind of connection. Spooked, he continues on. The other
          trackers follow, William looking tense. At the back of the
          group, one of the mercenaries slows down, sensing something in
          the forest.
          William is still watching Finn when they hear a bloodcurdling
          CRY behind them. The mercenary's horse gallops out of the trees
          without its rider, a gaping wound in its side. William and the
          others look shaken but Finn doesn't even turn around, riding on.

          Eric pulls Snow White along. Beyond a bridge we see open fens
          -- the bridge LEADS OUT OF THE DARK FOREST -- and birds
          circling on the distant horizon.
          Snow White looks relieved as she follows him down a slope.

          He ignores, follows tracks, then stops as he sees the STONE
          BRIDGE below -- LEADING OUT OF THE DARK FOREST. Snow White
          stares at it too, relieved. Beyond the bridge there are open
          fens.

          Eric and Snow White are SLAMMED off the bridge and land in
          the shallow creek below -- among the CARCASSES OF SLAIN
          ANIMALS. The troll roars and comes after them, swinging its
          giant stone fists. Eric grabs Snow White and runs --
          As the troll catches up with them, Eric shoves her out of the
          way and draws his hatchets.

<b>                         ERIC
</b>          Run!
          Snow White turns and flees. Eric runs at the Troll. He ducks
          as a mighty arm sweeps over him, darts between the troll's
          legs, and hacks at its leg with his hatchets.
          The Troll falters a bit then --
          A swinging stone fist catches him and hurls him across the
          creek.
          Snow White looks back to see Eric lying stunned on the
          ground, his wound bleeding again, at the troll's mercy. She
          hesitates, still terrified, then runs back.
          The Troll towers over the huntsman. It raises its stone hands
          to crush him when --
          Snow White arrives -- SCREAMING LIKE A BANSHEE!
          The Troll looks around in surprise. So does Eric. A beat,
          then the monster turns away from Eric, striding towards Snow

          Snow White stares into the troll's eyes, seeing something
          almost gentle in its monstrous gaze, slowly losing her fear.
          The troll stares at her too, confused, then slowly pacified,
          until it finally turns and strides away.
          Eric stares in disbelief. Snow White is rooted to the spot,
          also confused but strangely moved by what's happened. Eric
          rises to his feet painfully and heads over, taking her by the
          arm.

          It's clear he sees her in a different light. She stares back
          at him. Eric holds her gaze, struggling a bit, then...

          sees her expression change --
          GHOSTLY BACKLIT FIGURES EMERGE on the banks of the marsh now,
          holding bows and arrows. Eric looks around for an escape route,
          but everywhere he turns MORE FIGURES APPEAR.
          He draws his axe when A FIGURE IN A HOODED CLOAK (ANNA) appears,
          clutching her bow like a goddess.

          The youngest of the dwarves, GUS, is beaming at Snow White with
          his dirty teeth.

          He smiles, almost sweetly, disarming her. Snow White looks at
          her other captors now, noticing a blind dwarf, (MUIR), who sits
          with his son (QUERT), also gazing at her.

          Snow White gives him a look. He calms her with a look of his
          own.

          Nion gives Eric another smack around the head.

          Quert jumps to and helps his father as he makes his way to
          Snow White. He touches her face and something happens in
          him. His demeanor softens and the hint of a smile lands on

          The dwarves look round to see a DOZEN SILHOUETTED HORSEMEN

          From their hidden vantage point, Eric, Snow White, and the

          a small troop remain behind. Realizing they have no choice but
          to retreat further, Duir and Coll signal and the dwarves follow

          Snow White and the huntsman emerge from the cave to see a
          shimmering landscape of glistening moss and sunlight. It's like
          a mirage. The air is filled with specks of pollen and a strange
          HUMMING NOISE echoes like music. For Snow White, it's the most
          beautiful sound she's ever heard. Next to her, Nion, snorts:

<b>                         NION

          GORT scoops up a handful of moss and moulds himself some ear
          plugs, sticking them in his ears. Snow White is still mesmerized
          by the fairy music and the shimmering haze.

<b>                         SNOW WHITE

          He takes another swig and sings at the top of his voice, out of
          tune, trying to drown out the humming of the unseen fairies.

          Snow White sits amazed, drinking in the sights and sounds.
          Animals emerge from the forest -- SQUIRRELS, BEAVERS, FOXES,
          BIRDS. Slowly they make their way towards the ruins, gazing at
          Snow White.

          sees the two MAGPIES who watched over her at the castle. Two
          BEAUTIFUL FAIRIES WITH THE DEER EYES slip out of the magpies'
          bodies, beaming at her.
          As Snow White sits up, they direct her to the woods WHERE A
          DAZZLING LIGHT SHINES THROUGH A TREE. As she walks animals fall
          in alongside her.
          A little way away, Gus snores in his sleep. The golden light
          crosses his face and he wakes up. As he opens his eyes, he
          stares in wonder, then quickly wakes the other dwarves.
          They all stare in amazement now, even the blind MUIR. Eric is
          the last to wake up, wondering what the fuss is all about.
          They rise and follow to --

<b>          AT THE TREE

          Eric looks up to see ALDAN the Yakut emerging through the trees
          on horseback, notching another arrow to his bow.
          A FIERCE WIND rips through the sanctuary now, shadows spreading
          where there was once light. Eric sees FINN appear on horseback,
          looking like a demon god in the gathering darkness.
          The huntsman grabs his axe. So do the dwarves, pulling on their
          battle masks.
          WILLIAM emerges through the trees to see ALDAN aiming his bow at

          balance just as he fires --
          The arrow narrowly misses Snow White, thudding into a tree. Gus
          grabs her by the hand.

          before he can swing the dwarves attack both men --
          Eric only has eyes for Finn. They stare at each other in the
          roaring wind, then Finn gallops into the forest after-Snow White
          Eric RUNS in the same direction --

          hooves when suddenly they stop. He stops too, notching an arrow
          to his bow, peering into the gloom and listening.
          There's a tense silence, then SUDDENLY HE HEARS A NOISE. He
          spins around, ready to fire, when he sees it's only Finn's
          riderless horse galloping past --
          He realizes too late that it's a trick -- FINN EXPLODES OUT OF

          William spots Snow White up ahead. She disappears into the
          trees and he rides faster. She erupts from behind a branch and

          Gus's axe stops inches from William's eyes. Snow White
          recognizes the young warrior, staring at him in surprise.

          Snow White stares in disbelief, tears of surprise welling in her
          eyes. Gus looks even more confused, lowering his axe.
          William slowly rises to his feet, gazing back at Snow White,
          when THEY HEAR A TWIG SNAP --

          over, dead at last but still astride his horse.
          Snow White falls to her knees in anguish, cradling the dying
          Gus. He smiles weakly, holding her gaze, then whispers:

          under the vicious blow and landing a brutal one of his own --

          Slowly, Eric pulls himself free of the branches cutting into his

           Ravenna's head is down, depleted, forlorn. Completely still. 
           Ink pools around her bony hands. But when she raises her head --

          Still bleeding from his wounds, Eric hurries back through the
          forest until he sees Snow White and the seven dwarves gathered
          around Gus's body, chanting a low prayer. Eric stares in
          surprise, then notices William.

          from poison. Her eyes water and her vision blurs. The false

          fiercely, William joining in, until the shrieking birds
          finally take to the sky and vanish on the horizon.
          Eric and William rush to Snow White's side now. The dwarves
          arrive too, hurrying through the snow.
          William cradles Snow White in his arms, trying to revive her,
          but it's no use. Eric stares in dismay as he sees the poison
          drain the color from her lips. He kneels down and gazes at

          Muir stares back at him with his empty eyes, tears glistening
          in them.
          William collapses in prayer, the light in Snow White's eyes
          almost gone. Eric looks over, sees William's grief is as
          great as his own, and finally stops fighting.
          Snow White looks up at William as if she wants to say
          something, then the light in her eyes goes out.
          The dwarves are heartbroken. Eric looks dazed.
          William leans down and kisses Snow White gently on the lips.

          her name. When I came back from the wars
          I carried with me the stench of death and
          the anger of the lost. I wasn't worth
          saving. But she did so anyway. I loved
          her more than anything or anyone. And
          then I let her out of my sight and she
          was gone and I became myself again. A
          self I never cared for. Until you. You
          remind me of her. Her spirit. Her

          both deserved better. And I'm sorry to

          shape up into a Faerie taking William up high. In a violent

          six feet lower. The table shatters in splinters, William

</b>
          Snow White approaches Ravenna and kneels beside her, Ravenna
          is weak. She ages dozens of years within seconds, her face
          shows no anger, no hate, just a strange understanding.

<b>                         SNOW WHITE
</b>          Why this? Why all of this?

                          
          Snow White, overwhelmed by compassion, places her hand on
          Ravenna's chest. Ravenna puts her own wrinkled hand on Snow
          White's.
          Ravenna smiles. She gently taps on Snow White's... in a 
          strange and affectionate motherly way.

                          
          Eric and William, exhausted and battered climb the steps of 
          the mirror chamber. It is over. 
          Ravenna stares up at Snow White's face in a shining halo of
          light above her from the ceiling.

<b>                         RAVENNA
</b>          (whispering to Snow White)
          See child,... we are bound.

<b>                         SNOW WHITE
</b>          (whispers to Ravenna calming)
          It will be all right...
          Ravenna whispers incomprehensible words with a peaceful smile
           on her face. The clouds move in the disc of light above Snow 
           White. The light falls over Ravenna's face. 
           The light fades out of her eyes and she dies.

           In the cloister gardens, a blossom flowers on the apple tree and
           the world is born again --

           In death, Ravenna's beautiful blue eyes are wide open, fixed on
           the halo of light that surrounds Snow White's head.

<b>                          SNOW WHITE
</b>           Backlit in a golden hue. A crown is placed on her head.
           We're in...
          Packed for the coronation. Duke Hammond and Bishops surround
          her. Snow White smiles and looks out at all assembled - her
          subjects, her friends, the people she's come to know and love
          - meeting the eyes of Rose, looking young and beautiful again
          -- Anna and Lily -- the seven dwarves, who all wipe away
          tears.
          She sees William off to the side, smiling, looking on
          adoringly. But her eyes continue through the crowd, looking

</b>          Eric, in the very back of the cathedral, near the door.
          Their eyes meet, as if they're the only two in the room.
          This lasts several moments until --

<b>                         BEITH
</b>          Hail to the Queen!
          And then the huntsman smiles and leaves.

          We drop down from the castle to find the huntsman, on horseback
          heading toward us.

</b>          As for the huntsman...
          Eric goes under the village arch, back toward the forest.

          belonged.
