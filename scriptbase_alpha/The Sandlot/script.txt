          Of the 9 best (11-year-old) buddies that ever lived. On a
          makeshift baseball diamond - a sandlot... circa 1962:
                         
          SCOTTY SMALLS, studious-looking; ALAN "YEAH-YEAH" McCLENNAN,
          little, hyper; HAMILTON "HAM" PORTER, tubby with a huge smile;
          KENNY DeNUNEZ, handsome bean pole; TOMMY "REPEAT" TIMMONS and
          his brother TIMMY; BERTRAM GROVER WEEKS, wearing inch- thick
          horn rims; JEFF "SQUINTS" PALLEDOROUS, a transistor radio
          plug wedged in his ear; and BENNY RODRIGUEZ, leaning on
          Scotty's shoulder, sporting the world's all-time hottest
          sneakers... P.F. Flyers.
                         
          One palm up, together like the 9 musketeers they're holding
          forward a baseball... with a mysterious smudge.

           Everyone's got that one summer when
           they were a kid... a summer so perfect,
           that it stays with them forever. It
           stays caught in time, like Camelot.
           pause That summer is like a book with
           a million blank pages that you get to
           fill with the greatest story you could
           ever dream up.
                          (BEAT)
           This is a story about a legend. And
           for us, that summer was the one when
           the legend got made.

           They're not exactly a dime a dozen,
           but there's plenty of people who've
           done real great things. But hardly
           anyone has ever met a certified Legend,
           because most of them are dead before
           they get voted one.

           The Babe. And when he called his famous

           series, he made sure he'd live forever.

          a row of houses, whose backyards are all chain link fenced.
          The fencing is trimmed individually in wood, bamboo etc...
          One has the world's coolest treehouse. Next to it... is the

          of that green "tropical-look" privacy fiberglass lashed to

           Yeah-Yeah... let's play.
                         
          The guys round up in the infield. As they play catch, they
          spread farther and farther apart... until they've each taken
          up the position they most like to play. They fit the paltry
          little diamond; scrappy, happy kids.

          Tract homes - everybody's got a different thing going in the

           When I moved in that summer, I'd never
           played baseball, but it wasn't too
           tough figuring out who these guys'
           heroes were. So, after a week of
           watching... I figured baseball seemed
           like the best way to get in with them.

          in bed, oiling his glove, staring out his window at Scotty's
          house. Taped to his footboard is the most important picture
          of all... a picture of The Babe.

          bothered and unhappy. This stuff is too damn easy for him.
          He whips on a last bolt and connects the itty-bitty motor.

          a tiny scoopelvator snatches up a white marble. Drops it on
          a roller coaster track. The marble whips around corners and

          Almost walks away. Then musters the gumption. KNOCKS.

           Sure.
                         
          He places a pitching plaque. Scotty waits awkwardly. Waits
          for more words. They don't come.
                         
                          SCOTTY

          Scotty leaves, bringing the door with him on his way out.
          Through the cracked portal he sees Bill set a silver pedestal
          on the main shelf. On this he sets a baseball...
                         
                          
                          12
                         
                         
                          
                         
          just a baseball.
                         
          INT. SCOTTY'S ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING
                         
          Scotty wakes up. Checks his (Theme) clock. 8:30. He bolts
          out of bed. Dashes through the house to the front door.
          Throws it open and runs down to...
                         
          EXT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          ...the sidewalk. Fan sprinklers water all the lawns. Way
          far down the block
                         
                         HE GLIMPSES
                         
          Ham, at the HELMS BAKERY TRUCK, buying a donut, then scrambling
          around the far corner.
                         
                          HAM
           Hey-hey, come on! Wait up - wait up!
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          panics. Runs back inside and...
                         
          INT. SCOTTY'S ROOM - DAY
                         
          ...strips off his cowboy pj's. Redresses. Digs through his
                         
                         CLOSET
                         
          finding a vinyl, "toy" baseball glove. It's still in the
          package, with a note attached: "To Scotty Boy - Love, Grandma!"
          It's all he's got. He shovels through a pair of Mickey Mouse
          ears - a cowboy hat - finds the closest thing he's got to a
          baseball cap... a long, duck-billed fishing cap with a big
          embroidered trout.
                         
          EXT. ENROUTE TO THE SANDLOT - DAY
                         
          Scotty runs by (soon familiar places):
                         
                         A 5 & DIME
                         
          A BOYS CLUB
                         
          A LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD,
                         
          where he slows momentarily, envious of the crisply uniformed
          kids... wow. Moving on down
                         
          EXT. THE BLOCK OF SANDLOT COMMON HOUSES - DAY
                         
          whose backyards we already know. Scotty flat out stops at
                         
                          
                          13
                         
                         
                          
                         
                         THE HOUSE
                         
          with the fiberglass panels out back. Scary place.
                         
          EXT. THE SANDLOT - DAY
                         
          Scotty slips quietly through the secret fence doorway, emerging
                         IN
                         
          DEEP LEFT FIELD
                         
          where he hugs the perimeter, moving slowly toward the sandlot
          common houses. Winded, Scotty finds
                         
                         THE GANG'S
                         
          already playing "over the line."
                         
                          NARRATOR
           They never kept score. They never
           chose sides. They never even really
           stopped playing the game... it just
           went on forever. Everyday they picked
           up right where they left off the day
           before. It was an endless "dream game."
                          (BEAT)
           There was only 8 of them, so they didn't
           have a whole team. It didn't matter
           though... Benny was so good he took
           everyone's position when it was there
           ups.
                          (BEAT)
           I didn't know any of that then... I 
           just knew they were having the time of
           their lives and I wanted to be a part
           of it.
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          watches and listens (as he goes) to the SHARP, satisfying
          sound of the hardball, SNAPPING CLEANLY in the oily leather
          of their gloves.
                         
          HE LOOKS AT
                         
          his own toy glove... how embarrassing.
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          continues around the perimeter, trying to be seen and become
          invisible. He goes unwittingly CLOSER TO those green
          fiberglass panels.
                          14

          winds up and pitches to
                         
                         BENNY
                         
          who connects big. CRACK!
                         
                         SCOTTY'S
                         
          come too close to the green fence. Something has overcome
          him... fear! He stares with serious woollies at
                         
          A HOLE IN THE FIBERGLASS
                         
          and sees only dust rising in time with some great, SOUNDS OF
          EXHALATION. And then, before he can draw any conclusions...
          disaster.
                         
           GANG (O.S.)
           Hey! Look out!
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          whips a look up and sees
                         
          THE FLY BALL
                         
          coming right at him.
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          tracks it, frozen stiff. Scared shitless. At the past
          possible moment, he throws his arms over his face and ducks...
          social suicide.
                         
                         THE BALL
                         
          beans him at the glove covering his noggin.
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          hits his butt. The ball rolls a bit. Comes to an "I-dare-
          you" stop: right up against the diseased fiberglass panels of
          that preternatural fence. Scotty pulls his arms away from
          his face.
                         
                         THE GANG

                         SCOTTY
                         
          moves for the ball. As he goes, he sweats:
                         
                          SCOTTY
           'Kay, I'll get it!
                          (TO HIMSELF)
           Don't be a goofus - don't be a goofus -
           don't be a goofus.
                         
          He reaches the fence and the ball and stops. It's hard to
          move. The force emanating from the backyard has got him:
                         
          DUST THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE FIBERGLASS
                         
          keeps perfect time with the monster-breathing.
                         
          AN OLENADER BUSH
                         
          moves. It scares the living kapok out of
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          who snatches up the ball and back-pedals 10 feet.
                         
                          SQUINTS
           WE'RE WAITING...
                         
          He throws back the ball. And his chances of getting in with
          these guys are over. Because Scotty... throws like a girl!
                         
                         THE BALL
                         
          droops forward in the air. Lands 6 feet from him. Rolls
          slowly up to the gang, finally coming to a dainty stop at
          DeNunez' feet.
                         
                         THE GANG
                         
          looks from the ball to Scotty... they CRACK UP!

          down.
                         
                          DENUNEZ
           Come on, Benny-man, didn't you see
           that throw?
                         
          He imitates it, "flipping" his glove to Ham. The gang BUSTS
          UP again.
                         
                          HAM

                          SQUINTS
           I seen a guy once that threw like that.
           I mean not that bad, but at least so
           bad that he hadda move in the fourth
           grade 'cause they nicknamed him
           "Bloomers."
                         
          Benny's look stifles the bunch.
                         
                          BENNY
           I bet not one of you knows how The
           Babe got his nickname.
                         
                          HAM
           Easy, 'cause of the way he looked like
           a little kid face.
                         
                          BERTRAM
           Bull, it's just 'cause he liked kids
           and stuff.
                         
                          SQUINTS
           Wrong. The Babe was called The Babe,
           because he was like the child of Yankee
           Stadium.

                          BENNY
           I knew it. You're all full of crap.
           George Herman Ruth got his nickname
           because his mom died when he was just
           a little kid, and he hadda go live in
           an orphanage.
                         
          Silence. None of the other guys has heard this before.
                         
                          BENNY (CONT'D)
           Nobody liked him there. The bigger
           guys picked on him all the time. And
           when they messed with him he couldn't
           fight back, 'cause he was just... like
           scared. So when they messed with him,
           he cried about it.
                          (BEAT)
           He cried... so they called him The
           Babe.
                         
          This hits home real good.
                         
                          BENNY (CONT'D)
           How ya think that kid just felt?
                         
          Benny exits the sandlot, leaving the others with a lesson
          learned.
                         
                          NARRATOR
           Everyone knew Benny was different.

          far behind him.

           Even though he seemed like a regular
           guy, he wasn't. Benny was special,
           and he was loyal.

           When they'd all tried out for youth
           league, they'd all made it. But when
           they found out they'd have to play on
           different teams, Benny told 'em that
           if they couldn't play together, they
           shouldn't play at all. So, they stayed
           together.

           sorry for me 'cause I was such a weenie

          eating breakfast. Scotty's spoon CLANGS one too many times.
          Bill looks up at him.

          Scotty comes back in. Stops mutely near Bill. Long, agonizing
          seconds pass. Finally:
                         
                          SCOTTY

           (so Mom won't hear)

           Um, yeah, but later, okay? I gotta
           get this done.
                         
          It ain't much, but it's something.

           Okay, thanks.

                          MOM
           Bill, can't you take a break and teach

                          MOM
           - How long could it take? You can't
           spare a half hour to show him?
                         
          Bill drops his pen. Checks his watch. A lost battle here.

           Fine. Alright. I'll get my glove.
           Come on.

          Bill exits past them. Scotty's been "Mom-embarrassed." She
          looks at him:

           There. See. Told you so.

          Bill slides his hand into his glove. He warms up the cradle,
          POPPING the "hardball" into the palm.
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          stands ready to "learn" on the other side of the yard.
          Appropriately pitiful in "trout" cap and toy glove.

                          BILL
           Keep your eye on the ball. Put the
           glove up where it goes. Okay?
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Yeah, okay, I think so.
                         
          Bill throws one to Scotty. The toy glove goes up to the right.
          The ball sails by to the left.
                         
                          SCOTTY (CONT'D)
           Darn. Sorry.
                         
          Bill's a little amazed at that one. He checks his watch.
                         
                          BILL
           That's alright, just throw it back.
                         
          Scotty eagerly retrieves it. Turns to throw - deja vu - he
          runs over, hands Bill the ball.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Here.
                         
          He runs back across the yard. Turns 'round again. Holds his
          glove up stiffly.
                         
                          SCOTTY (CONT'D)
           Okay. I'm ready.
                         
          Bill cannot believe this. Checks his watch again.

           Keep your eye on the ball. Put the
           glove up where the ball goes.
                         
          He throws again. The ball bounces off the toy glove - breaks
          the webbing.
                         
                          SCOTTY

                          BILL
           - not bad. Right side at least. Now,
           just throw it back this time.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           But my glove -
                         
          Bill's looking at his watch again. Scotty fetches the ball -
          gulps - "flips" it back.

          Scotty. Only Scotty. Standing there game as hell, trying to
          catch balls that seem to be coming too fast. The ball comes.
          Scotty ducks. The ball hits the block wall behind him,
          caroming back toward where we assume Bill is throwing from.

          Scotty's mom pulls his hand away from his eye. Great shiner.

                          (BEAT)
           Sorry. We'll try again soon.
                         
          EXT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Scotty emerges. Sits on the porch. Pitiful and forlorn.
          Chin in his hands, he looks across the street. He starts.
          His hand moves to cover his black eye... but he thinks the
          better of it.
                         
                         BENNY'S
                         
          on the curb across the street. A moment goes by. Benny raises
          a hand.
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          slowly waves back.
                         
                         BOTH
                         
          Benny comes over to Scotty's sidewalk.
                         
                          BENNY
           Gonna go play some ball. Need a extra
           guy. Wanna go?
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Naw. Thanks.
                         
                          BENNY
           Why not? Doncha like baseball?
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Oh. Yeah. But, ah...
                         
                          BENNY
           But what?
                         
          Scotty searches for a quick way out of this. Gets it:
                         
                         
                         
                          
                          24
                         
                         
                          
                         
                          SCOTTY
           But my glove's busted. So, ya know, I
           can't go. Thanks, though.
                         
          Benny reaches behind his back. Takes something out of his
          jeans - like he's going for a gun. Smiles a little.
                         
                          BENNY
           That's okay.
                         
          He offers it to Scotty... a "real" glove.
                         
                          BENNY (CONT'D)
           I got a extra one.
                         
          Scotty SHOUTS over his shoulder:
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Mom! I'm gonna go play some ball!
                         
          As they move away down the block.
                         
                          SCOTTY (CONT'D)
           Thanks. Cool glove.
                         
                          BENNY
           Yeah. Cool shiner. We gotta stop by
           the 5 & 10 first. Need a new ball.
           And chaw and stuff, ya know?
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Yeah.
                         
                          BENNY
           You dip chaw?
                         
                          SCOTTY
                          (COMPLETELY CLUELESS)
           Sure. A'course.
                         
          EXT. FIVE & DIME - DAY
                         
          Benny & Scotty go inside.
                         
          INT. FIVE & DIME - DAY
                         
          Benny grabs a new baseball on the stride, and handful of
          bazooka from a jar on the soda fountain counter. He leaves
          the money and exits. Scotty follows.
                          25
                         
                         
                         
                         
          EXT. REAR OF FIVE & DIME - DAY
                         
          Benny and Scotty come upon the gang (all their mouths are
          full a' bazooka) as Ham's chompin' on a candy cigar doing a
                         BABE IMITATION:
                         
                          HAM
           Hey! Check me out! I'm the
           Great Bambino!
                         
          The gang laughs.
                         
                          SCOTTY
                          (OVER EAGER)
           Who's that?
                         
          The gang stifles. They're none-to-pleased. Ham sees why.
          The new kid... "flipper." Eight pairs of eyes burn holes in
          his little soul.
                         
                          HAM
           What?...
                          (BEYOND HIM)
           What did he say?
                         
                          BERTRAM
           Were you born in a barn, man?
                         
                          YEAH-YEAH
           Yeah-yeah, what planet are you from?
                         
                          SQUINTS
           You never heard of The Sultan of Swat?!

                          NARRATOR
           I had no idea who they were talking
           about. But there was no way I could
           let them know that... so, I lied.

                          SCOTTY
           Oh! The Great Bambino! Of course. I
           thought you said The Great Bambi.

                          (SHIVERING)
           That wimpy deer?
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Ah, yeah - I guess. Sorry.
                         
          The gang goes SILENT. They spit - they're tough. Scotty
          dribbles - he's wimpy.
                         
                          BENNY
                          (W/MOUHTFUL)
           So, Scott, this is Ken DeNunez; Alan
           McClennan, we call him Yeah-Yeah;
           Hamilton Porter, we call him Ham; Tommy
           and Timmy Timmons, Bertram Grover Weeks,
           and Mike "Squints" Palledorus.
                          (TO GANG)
           He's Scott Smalls.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Hi.
                         
          The gang just stares.
                         
                          BENNY
           He's gonna play with us. He makes
           nine. Now we got a team.
                         
          EXT. SANDLOT - DAY
                         
          The pack follows Benny onto the diamond. Scotty trails after
          them.
                         
                          BERTRAM
           Why'd you bring him for, Benny?
                         
                          BENNY
           'Cause there's eight of us, and he
           makes nine.
                         
                          BERTRAM
           Yeah, so would my sister, but I didn't
           bring her!
                         
                          BENNY
           With nine Guys we got a whole team.
                         
                          
                          27
                         
                         
                          
                         
                          HAM
           No, with Elswenger we had a whole team,
           and Elswenger could throw!
                         
                          DENUNEZ
           He ain't game, Benny. He can't throw
           for nothin'.
                         
          Scotty drifts off by himself. He can hear what's exchanged.
                         
                          TIMMY
           Benny, you already play all the empty
           positions since Elswenger moved to
           Arizona.
                         
                          BENNY
           And now I get to rotate 8 positions
           instead of 7. I need the practice.
                         
                          SQUINTS
           No you don't. It's stupid, Benny.
           The kid's an L-7 weenie.
                         
                          YEAH-YEAH
           Yeah-yeah, Oscar Mayer even.
                         
                          BENNY
           Oh yeah, Squints, and you're Willie
           freakin' Mays. You catch like a dork -
           anybody ever bust your chops about
           that?

                          BENNY

                          BENNY

           Yeah-yeah.

                          BENNY
           How come he don't get to be?
                         
          Nobody's got an answer for that one. Base up you blockheads.)
                         
                         THE GANG
                         
          hits the field. Their suspicious glares aren't lost on
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          standing off by himself, kinda lost. Benny comes over.
                         
                          BENNY (CONT'D)
           You take right field, Smalls.
                         
                          SCOTTY
                          (EAGER)
           Right. Okay. Ah... where exactly is
           that?
                         
                          BENNY
                          (SURPRISED)
           Uh, over there.
                         
          Scotty runs "over there" anxiously.
                         
                         BENNY
                         
          takes home plate worried: "Maybe the kid is a weenie."

          DeNunez at the mound. Benny's up.
                         
                          BENNY (CONT'D)
           Get two.
                         
          Repeat at 3rd, stabs it effortlessly and fires to 2nd. Timmy
          snatches it down and drag-tags the invisible base runner,
          then fires to Bertram at 1st. SNAP! Outta there. Bertram
          throws back to DeNunez. Benny's ready:
                         
                          BENNY (CONT'D)
           Smalls! Get one!
                         
          CRACK! THE BALL
                         
          arcs up... comes down right at
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          who raises the glove, and skippers around, as if he were
          tracking a falling leaf. The ball lands 5 feet behind him.
                         
                          
                          29
                         
                         
                          
                         
                         THE GANG
                         
          shakes its collective head, exasperated.
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          runs to the ball, is about to throw... runs it in to DeNunez
          instead.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Here. Sorry, sorry.
                         
                         THE GANG
                         
          is stunned.
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          runs back to right field. Ready again - a game kid.
                         
                         BENNY
                         
          trots out after him.
                         
                          BENNY
           Hey, you can throw it ya know.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           No, I can't... I don't know how.
                          (LUMPY THROAT)
           Um, thanks for taking me here... but
           I think better go.
                         
          Scotty turns to leave. Benny grabs his arm.
                         
                          BENNY
           You think too much. I bet you get
           straight A's and shit, huh?
                         
                          SCOTTY
           No, I got a B once. Actually it was
           an A minus.
                          (QUICK)
           But it shoulda been a B.
                         
                          BENNY
           This is baseball, you're not supposed
           to think, you're just supposed to play.
                          (BEAT)
           You ever have a paper route?
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Uh, I helped a guy one time.
                         
                         
                          
                          30
                         
                         
                          
                         
                          BENNY
           Throw it like you chuck a paper. When
           your arm gets here... just let go of
           it.
                          (PAUSE)
           Just let go.
                         
          Scotty nods. Benny starts back.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Wait - how do I catch it?
                         
                          BENNY
           Don't worry. Just stand there and
           stick your glove in the air. I'll
           take care of it.
                         
                         HOME PLATE
                         
          Benny mentally calculates the distance. Puts a little rub on
          the ball. Flips it into the air...
                         
                          BENNY (CONT'D)
           Smalls, get one!
                         
          ...and swings through deliberately. CRACK!
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          sees it coming. Stands there stiffly. Sticks his glove up,
          closes his eyes.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Please, catch it. Please, catch it.
           Please, ca -
                         
          SNAP! His glove swings down. He opens his eyes. Looks into
          his glove. The ball is there. He takes it out and chucks
          the ball like a folded paper.
                         
                         BERTRAM
                         
          catches it good and solid at 1st.
                         
                          BERTRAM
           Okay! Hey, let's play ball!
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          loosens up. From home plate

                         BENNY
                         
          gives him a "Thumbs Up." The significance of this is only
          outweighed by his sudden fear, when...
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          glimpses something.
                         
                         SCOTTY'S POV
                         
          of some great, lumbering thing moving past a crack in those
          green fiberglass panels.
                         
          EXT. THE BLOCK - DUSK
                         
          In good spirits, the guys break off to their houses.
                         
                         SCOTTY & BENNY
                         
          split up in the middle of the street between their homes.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Thanks.
                         
          Already at his door, Benny just raises his glove in answer.
                         
                          SCOTTY (CONT'D)
           Wait, here - your glove.
                         
                          BENNY
           Keep it.
                         
          INT. SCOTTY'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Scotty opens a new writing tablet, and titles the page:
          "Baseball Stuff to Remember." He writes: "1. The Great
          Bambino?" He hasn't got a clue.
                         
          EXT. VACANT LOT - DAY
                         
          Benny coaches Scotty. Correct batting stance and swing. Benny
          thumb-flicks bottle caps at Scotty from a coffee can full.
          They're tough to hit. But soon Scotty's tagging every one of
          them.

          tags it. The ball sails over

          Squints arrives with a box of baseball cards.
                         
                          NARRATOR
           Everyday, first thing, we'd all pick a
           card from what we called "The Dugout."
                         
          Squints shakes it up. Everybody picks one.
                         
                          NARRATOR (CONT'D)
           It was just a shoe box, but whoever we
           picked, we got to be when it was our
           ups. One day, when Ham took his pick
           a little too seriously, the guys let
           me in on the world's most terrifying
           secret...

          takes one step toward that fence.

           Go over there, real slow, and be quiet.
           Don't touch the fence, just peek through
           that hole in the green stuff... go on.
                         
          As Scotty goes forward, the gang steps back.

          A LIMITED VIEW of 3 feet square. WE SEE nothing but the
          ball... in the small crater it's made in the dirt. There are
          oddly similar craters in the immediate vicinity. Those craters
          are empty.
                         
          A MAMMOTH, HAIRY PAW

           the graham while you roast the mallow-
                         
          He does. The mallow flames to life.

           The legend of The Beast goes back a

          A legendary place... benefitting from years of kid-

           The Beast belongs to Mr. Mertle, the

          that form tortured faces in the shadowy recesses.
                         
           SQUINTS (V.O.)
           Mertle's Acres was a bitchin' place,
           that had everything you could ever
           imagine.
                         
                         OTHER STUFF
                         
          like savaged shopping carts. A school bus graveyard. Scrap
          motorbikes. Cargo ship buoy balls. The gutted shell of a
          fighter plane.
                         
           SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           And the stuff was worth a fortune.
           So, one day Mr. Mertle got him this
           new pup from the pound. They were
           glad to get rid of him, on account of
           while he'd been there, he'd killed
           three dogs bigger than he was.
                          (BEAT)
           That was exactly what Mr. Mertle figured
           he needed to protect his junkyard,
           'cause people kept stealing stuff at
           night, when he wasn't around.
                         
          WE DRIFT THROUGH
                         
          a maze of dark, grimy junk-passageways.
                         
           SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           So he bought The Beast, and set him
           loose in Mertle's Acres.
                         
          SOMETHING LOPES BY
                         
          at the end of a passage. (NOTE: We never fully see The Beast.)
                         
           SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           The Beast was still just a pup of six
           months, but he already weighed a 150
           pounds... and he kept gettin' bigger.
                         
          A TRASH BAG
                         
          full of meat hits the ground - disappears. SLIFFTHT! It
          spits back INTO FRAME... empty and tattered.

           SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           He threw The Beast a trash bag full of
           meat every night, and just left him
           alone. All alone in the whole place
           by himself... to grow.
                         
                         AN EYEBALL
                         
          among a pile of broken headlights. As big as the headlights.
                         
          FLEETING GLIMPSES OF MORE STUFF
                         
          like Mannequins, with bite-chunks missing. Plastic flamingoes,
          brutally mangled. A decapitated "lawn jockey." A plastic
          cow, legs gnawed off. And BREATHING... amongst the artificial
          "life" forms.
                         
          A GARGANTUAN FOOTPRINT
                         
          in the center of an old truck tire.
                         
          THE BEAST'S SHOULDERS
                         
          moving powerfully - as tall as a burned-out VW.
                         
           SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           And so, in a few months, the pup grew
           into The Beast. And he grew big as a
           car. And he grew mean, 'cause nobody
           liked him, and he didn't like nobody
           either.
                          (BEAT)
           And so he only had one thing on his
           mind... to kill.
                         
          INT. MERTLE'S ACRES - NIGHT

           And he did. And he liked it.

          TWO OTHER THIEVES

          caves in. The Thieves are dragged out, BLATHERING in horror.

          FROM HIGH ABOVE MERTLE'S ACRES
                         
          The Beast moves like a murderous phantom. WE HEAR ROARING,
          and primordial bloodlust.
                         
          VARIOUS OTHER THEIVES
                         
          are tossed hither and yon... mixed in with fake flamingoes,
          and a flying plastic cow.

          Police cars. DETECTIVES speak with MR. MERTLE; his shoulders
          slumped, his eyes moist. They show him file photos of (THEIVES

           SQUINTS (V.O.)
           The Beast was the most perfect junkyard
           dog that ever lived... a true killing
           machine.
                          (BEAT)
           After awhile, the police started getting
           phone calls from people, reporting all
           the missing thieves. The ones The
           Beast had killed... it added up to
           about 37 guys.
                         
          Mr. Mertle solemnly heads inside the junkyard.
                         
           SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           But they never found a single body...
           not one. Some people say they all got
           away, and were just so scared that
           they ended up in insane asylums and
           stuff.
                          (BEAT)
           But we know what really happened.
                         
          Mr. Mertle emerges from the junkyard. Cops take cover behind
          their cars. Guns are leveled toward Mr. Mertle and what
          follows him at the end of a rusty tow chain.

           The Beast... ate them.

           He ate them bones and all.

          PEOPLE slam their windows - draw their curtains. LITTLE KIDS
          are snatched up by PARENTS, who run inside and lock their

          leads the The Beast on a huge chain. (NOTE: We only see bits

           SQUINTS (V.O.)
           The Beast was good at his guarddog
           job. Too good. So the cops said he
           had to be retired. But he didn't have
           to be killed or nothin', on account of
           there was no evidence... no bones...
           no teeth for dental records.

           SQUINTS (V.O.)
           The police told Mr. Mertle that if
           wanted to keep The Beast, he hadda
           lock him in his backyard, so he could
           never get out.

          "collars" The Beast with the other end.

                         SQUINTS

          EXT. THE SANDLOT - MORNING
                         
          The guys are waiting anxiously as Yeah-Yeah and Squints run
          over. Yeah-Yeah tosses Benny the ball. He rubs it up. Passes
          it along. They all take a turn.
                         
                          BENNY
           What took you so long?! We been here

           Squints was pervin' a dish.
                         
                          SQUINTS
           Shut up, I wasn't!

                          YEAH-YEAH
           Oh, yeah-yeah! It was great! So I
           went around pretended like I was selling
           perscriptions to magazines. And the
           people asked if they should pay me
           now. So I said yeah-yeah, pay me now!
           And they did!
                         
          The guys are astonished.

           What-what?! I'll take it back. I
           know it was crappy, but I didn't have
           no money, I -

           Face it, Benny. It's not a fit day
           out for man nor beast. We gotta call
           it for the day.

           Benny would've played ball all day and
           all night... rain shine, tidal wave,
           whatever, it didn't matter. Baseball
           was the only thing he cared about and
           everything else was just a waste of
           time.
                          (BEAT)
           But, of all the things we ever did
           besides baseball, goin' to the pool
           was what he tolerated best. Even though
           none of us had ever seen a Playboy
           magazine - which we constantly lied
           about - we figured the pool was the
           next best thing to being there.

           It wasn't the Pool Honeys like we said,
           'cause if any one of them had come up
           to any one of us, we'd of peed our
           pants.
                          (BEAT)
           We went for... the Lifeguard.

          The gang watches on tense as hell.
                         
          Squints peeks at them through a secretly opened eye. As the
          Lifeguard is "saving" his sneaky life, Squints can no longer
          restrain himself, he grabs her - gives her a sloppy SMOOCH!
          She tears away. Stands up over his wimpy little form:

          out, dragging their clothes after them. They help Squints
          up.

           Did you plan that?!
                         
                          SQUINTS
           A'course I did. Been plannin' it for
           years.
                         
          They let Squints walk out front:
                         
                          NARRATOR
           Michael "Squints" Palledorous walked a
           little taller that day. And we had to
           tip our hats to him. He was lucky she
           hadn't beat the crap out of him. We
           wouldn't have blamed her. What he'd
           done was sneaky, rotten and low.
                          (BEAT)
           And cool.
                          (BEAT)
           Not another one among us would've ever,
           even for a million dollars, had the
           guts to put the move on the Lifeguard.
           He did. He had kissed a woman. And
           he kissed her long and good.
                          (BEAT)
           We got banned from the pool forever
           that day... but every time we walked
           by after that, the Lifeguard looked
           down from her watchtower, right over
           at Squints... and smiled.

          6. Stan Musial, 7. Lou Brock, 8. Luis Aparicio, 9. Brooks
          Robinson, 10. Frank Robinson, 11. Bob Uecker. Right Field is
          near the green fence. Left Field is in the left. Double play
          gets two outs. Triple play is impossible. Single is good.
          Double is better. Home run is best. And, ominously, "Don't
          get in a pickle or you're dead!" And one entry that's double
          question marked: 1. The Great Bambino??

          blocking out the sun against the panels. A gargantuan shadow.
                         
          THE SUN GOES DOWN

           Ya know, stuff that it's better not to

           just makes it worse.

                          BILL
           We'll take another stab at catch when
           I get back, okay? So, take care of
           things while I'm gone. I'm counting
           on you.
                         
          He offers his hand to Scotty. They shake.
                         
                          SCOTTY
                          (PERKING UP)
           Okay. I will.
                         
          EXT. FIVE & DIME - DAY
                         
          The gang comes out with a new boxed baseball. Each has a
          pack of Topps. A bag of Bazooka.
                         
                          NARRATOR
           Once we got over trying to be big shots,
           we just stuck to what we could handle,
           and swore off the hard stuff forever.
           When we finally got back together for
           some baseball, something amazing
           happened.
                          (BEAT)
           It was an omen... one that was meant
           just for Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez.
                          68
                         
                         
                         
                         
          EXT. THE SANDLOT - DAY
                         
          They tear open their packs of baseball cards. First things
          first - they eat the gum sticks. Then, shuffle through the
          cards looking for gold.
                         
                          SQUINTS
           Whad'ya get, Ham?
                         
                          HAM
           A Mickey Mantle and 7 guys I never
           heard of. How 'bout you?
                         
                          SQUINTS
           A Brooks Robinson and a Koufax. Pretty
           good.
                         
                          BERTRAM
           I got junk.
                         
                          DENUNEZ
           One Drysdale, a bunch a duds.
                         
                          YEAH-YEAH
           Yeah-yeah, me too. Four bombs, but
           one Whitey Ford.
                         
                          SQUINTS
           Benny, whad -
                         
          The guys notice
                         
                         BENNY
                         
          staring down at the cards in his hands. He slowly shuffles
          them top to bottom... top to bottom.
                         
                         THE GANG
                         
          moves over, concerned.
                         
                          HAM
           Hey, Benny, whatsa matter?
                         
                          BERTRAM
           You okay, man?
                         
          Benny slowly raises his eyes. Slowly holds the cards out to
          Squints, who takes them cautiously. Squints shuffles them
          forwards and backwards. He passes the eight cards amongst
          them all.
                         
                          SQUINTS
           Oh, my God...

           I won't.
                         
                          HAM
           This can't happen... can it?
                         
                          BERTRAM
           It just did.
                         
                          YEAH-YEAH
           Yeah-yeah, it's an omen.
                         
          Squints hands the cards back to the Benny, who takes home
          plate alone.

          can only stare at him. Suddenly, Squints clutches his ear
                         PLUG:
                         
                          SQUINTS
           Oh geez... Oh geez. I - I don't believe
           it. Maury Wills just stole 80 bases!
                         
          The guys are boggled.
                         
                         BENNY
                         
          picks up a bat.
                         
                          BENNY
           We gotta play. I gotta play right
           now, guys. Right now.

          obeys. They hurry into the field. As they go:
                         
                          SCOTTY
           What's it mean?

           It's a miracle, Smalls. A damn miracle.
                         
                          NARRATOR
           We all expected something to happen
           right then... during that game. What
           we had just witnessed was bordering on
           the supernatural... we knew that greater
           hands than ours were at work.
                          (BEAT)
           And it happened alright.
                          (BEAT)
           It happened right in front of our
           noses... and we didn't even know it.

          CRACK!
                         
          Magic dust EXPLODES from Benny's bat. The red lacing BURSTS!
                         
                         THE BASEBALL
                         
          dermis flays. The string-wound innards fly into
                         
                         YEAH-YEAH'S GLOVE

                         THE INFIELD

           Naw, it ain't.
                         
                          SQUINTS
           C'mon, Benny, maybe two, three guys in
           history have ever busted the guts out
           of a ball. That's what the omen was.
                         
                          GANG
           Truly. Sure. Absolutely. Yeah-yeah,

                          BENNY
           All's it means is that we can't play
           no more. It's only noon, and I just
           blew the whole day for us.

           No, you didn't. It's the most amazing

                          BENNY
           Anybody got any money?
                          (NO ANSWER)
           Then it ain't okay, 'cause now we can't
           play no more.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Yeah, we can.

           What, you got 98 extra cents just layin'
           around at home, Smalls?
                         
                          SCOTTY
           No, but I got a ball.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          INT. BILL'S DEN - DAY
                         
          A BASEBALL on a silver pedestal (Bill's baseball). Scotty's
          HAND ENTERS FRAME. His indecisive FINGERS almost touch the
          ball... then, SNATCH!
                         
          EXT. THE SANDLOT - DAY
                         
          Scotty dashes across the schoolyard.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           (out of breath)
           I got it! Let's play!
                         
          He tosses the ball to
                         
                         BENNY
                         
          who catches it.
                         
                          BENNY
           Bitchin'. Your ball, your ups.
                         
          Benny hands Scotty the bat, heads to right field, leaving
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          alone at home plate with Ham (the catcher).

          at 2nd. Timmy almost drops it. There's a smudge on the ball.
          Timmy tosses to
                         
                         REPEAT

          in left. The ball caroms off Yeah-Yeah's glove, comes down
          fast! Yeah-Yeah barehands it. Safe. He launches to
                         
                         SQUINTS
                         
          in center. It's gonna be short! Squints sprints - Willy
          Mays basket catch. He throws to DeNunez.
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          digs in.

          fires. Scotty swings - WHIFF. Again - whif. Once more...
                         
          BOOM! Goodnight, Irene! Scotty drops the bat. Trots for
          first base in "home run" fashion.
                         
                         BENNY

                         THE BALL
                         
          drops over the green fiberglass fence.

           What the hell's he doing?
                         
                          BERTRAM
           Maybe the shock of his first homer was
           just too much for him.
                         
          AT THE GREEN FIBERGLASS FENCE
                         
          Scotty runs right up to it - clutches desperately. Panting.
          Trembling. The guys arrive. Scotty turns back to them... he
          has aged 25 years.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           We gotta get that ball back.
                         
                          HAM
           Right! Good one, Smalls.
                         
                          SQUINTS
           Sure. We'll just hop over and say,
           excuse me Mr. Beast sir, could we have
           our ball back, oh, and please don't
           kill us while we're here!

           It was a great shot, but forget about
           it... game's over. We'll get another
           ball.
                         
                          SCOTTY

                          BENNY
           Sure we do. You feel bad 'cause you
           belted a homer, and now we can't play
           no more.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           No! You don't understand! THAT WASN'T

                          SQUINTS
           Whadda you mean it wasn't your ball?
                         
                          SCOTTY
           It's my stepdad's. I stole it from
           his trophy room. It was a present or
           soemthing - somebody gave it to him.
           We have to get it back. He's gonna
           kill me!
                         
                          SQUINTS
           Smalls... listen to me. This is a
           matter of life and death.
                          (THINKS)
           Where did your old man get that ball?
                         
                          SCOTTY
           I dunno... I think some lady gave it
           to him.
                         
                          SQUINTS

          WHAT THEY SEE
                         
          a baseball in a little impact crater. A ball that has most
          clearly been autographed by... BABE RUTH.
                         
          A long, hideous forelimb thrusts from 'neath the lean-to. A
          massive paw-thing comes down on the ball. Drags it slowly
          away... leaving a baseball-deep furrow in the dirt. The
                         
          CANINE "LAUGHTER" comes again...

           by Babe Ruth, and brought it out here
           and actually played with it?

           Yeah. Smalls, Babe Ruth is the greatest
           baseball player that ever lived. People
           say he was less than a God, but more
           than a man. Ya know... like Hercules
           or somethin'.
                          (BEAT)
           The ball that you just aced to The
           Beast is worth... well, more than your
           whole life.

           I don't feel so good.
                         
          They all step back, expecting the worst. Then, they fan him
          with their baseball caps.

          Scotty hurries away from the "autographed" ball.
                         
                          MOM
           You know he doesn't like you touching
           his things.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Yeah, I know. Sorry, Mom.
                         
                          MOM
           Has he ever told you about that ball?
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Uh - no, not really, I don't think so -
           no, he hasn't at all - I don't know
           _anything_ about it.
                         
                          MOM
           It's signed by Babe Ruth...
                         
          Sweet mother of - Mom knows! Scotty may collapse.

           I was dead meat. I knew it. They
           knew it. We had thought that those
           cards Benny had gotten meant that
           something great was going to happen.
           Now I figured that they'd just meant
           my life was over.

           Hey? Why don't we just go over there
           and knock on the door, and ask Mr.

          of exposure-splintered balsa wood gliders, and a fleet of
          model rockets - their drag-chutes turning to dust. And
          hundreds of little empty craters - that used to cradle
          baseballs.

          EXT. THE BADLANDS - NIGHT
                         
          The baseball leaps from the ground - sticks in the catcher's
          mask collection basket.

          INT. TREE HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          The gang reels it in. Suddenly, the whole apparatus JOLTS.
                         
          EXT. THE BADLANDS - NIGHT
                         
          A great beef-paw yanks the end pipe under the tree.

          The vacuums build pressure fast. WHINE crazily.
                         
                         THE GANG

          The gang (minus Squints) is face down in the dirt - arms over
          heads. The vacuums explode. Foggy clouds of dust pour out
          of the treehouse. Squints appears. He's battleship grey.
          Takes his glasses off. Only his eyes show white.
                         
                          SQUINTS
           We've been going about this all wrong.
           I blame myself. We need total surprise.

          The guys all wield a shovel, and have flashlights taped to
          their baseball caps like coal miners.

          Flashlight beam at the fore, Scotty crawls with a safety rope
          'round his waist. He pokes the cardboard periscope up through
          the dirt.
                         
          THROUGH THE PERISCOPE
                         
          the Badlands from ULTRA LOW ground level. WE SCAN 360 degrees.
          Suddenly, the scan stops. The name B A B E R U T H, FILLS
          the periscope's lens.
                         
          EXT. THE BADLANDS - DAY
                         
          Scotty's hand feels for the Babe Ruth. He grabs it. It's
          slimey.
                         
           SCOTTY (O.S.)

          The ball SQUIRTS out of his fingers.
                         
          THE BALL ROLLS
                         
          beneath the lean-to. It hits
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          in the nose. With a SEISMIC ROAR The Beast leaps out. WE
          DON'T SEE MUCH. He's too big. We're too close.

          unconscious on the grass. The guys turn a hose on him. He
          comes 'round SCREAMING:

          EXT. THE SANDLOT - DAY
                         
          Yeah-Yeah heads across the field... waddle-waddle.

           Yeah-Yeah grew two feet in our eyes
           after that. There was no stinkin' way
           any of us would've showed back up, if
           we'd loaded our drawers.
                          (BEAT)
           Yeah-Yeah did. He showed back up and
           got right to work, like nothing ever
           happened.

           I think I know how to get it.
           (they're all ears)
           Anybody got an Erector Set?
                         
          Eyes dart. Brows feint.
                         
                          SQUINTS
           That thing with the nuts and bolts and
           tiny wrenches that you can build junk
           out of?
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Exactly.
                         
                          SQUINTS
           Never heard of it.

           Might have some pieces. Gee, I don't
           think so. I'd have to look. Maybe in
           the attic. Not in our room though.
                         
          INT. TREE HOUSE - DAY - 20 MINUTES LATER
                         
          The guys re-arrive. Each holding huge arm loads of Erector
          Set stuff.
                         
                          GANG (CONT'D)
           Guess I had more than I thought. Forgot
           my grandma got me some for my birthday.
           It's my little brother's.
                         
          Scotty's brought his "Set." A footlocker full of neatly
          arranged pieces. Nut and bolt compartments. Electric motor
          sections.

           Let's get to work. Here's the plans -
                         
          FURLSNAP! Holy cow! Scotty unfolds them - amazing crayola
          blueprints drawn on taped-together grocery bags.
                         
          INT./EXT. TREE HOUSE - DAY
                         
          The guys swarm the tree house. Scotty supervises from the
          backyard, wearing a plastic hardhat. They build. Scotty
          hooks up electric motors. Throws one toggle, and...
                         
          EXT. TREE HOUSE - DAY
                         
          ...it comes to life. A 35 foot hollow erector-beam and
          electric catapult-car assembly. They tilt-n'-tip it over the
          fence. Scotty pilots the little car from the treehouse deck.

          Scotty on controls. Squints on periscope, with Bertram on
          the Yuban-comm for him. Others at support points.
                         
          THE CAR drives down.

          THE UNSEEN BEAST

          Scotty stands alone on the tree house roof... staring down
          into the Badlands. A little, wrecked shell of a kid, who is
          now dead meat. The guys look up at him sorrowfully.
                         
                          NARRATOR
           My life was over. Just as Bill had
           finally warmed up to me, and asked me
           to be the man of the house, I had to
           knock a priceless chunk of history
           into the clutches of a monster. Great.

          FROM HIS PORCH
                         
          Benny watches a dejected Scotty slowly head inside across the
          street.

          INT. BENNY'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          The room is dark. Benny's in bed. He clicks on a "baseball-
          bat" flashlight. Shines the beam toward his footboard...
          illuminating the photo of The Babe.
                         
                          BENNY
           We can't get it back, Babe.
                          (BEAT)
           I'm sorry.
                         
          Suddenly, a RACKET from inside Benny's closet. A bright LIGHT
          GOES ON in there. Then, smoke comes out.
                         
          Benny jumps up on his bed - flattens against the wall. Hasn't
          done this in years:
                         
                          BENNY (CONT'D)
           M - M - Mom?...
                         
          The closet door CREAKS open... by itself. Everything inside
          is oddly devoid of color.
                         
                          BENNY (CONT'D)
           Who's there?!
                         
          BABE RUTH steps out of the closet. He exists in the only way
          any kid from 1962 has ever seen him: BLACK & WHITE.
                         
                          THE BABE
           Now don't go peeing your pants or
           nuthin', I'm just here to give ya a
           hand.
                         
          The Great Bambino PUFFS on a massive stogie... the source of
          all the smoke.
                         
                          BENNY
           B - B - But, you're...
                         
                          THE BABE
           ...dead? Legends never die, kid.
                         
          Benny comes off the wall. The enormous Ruth towers over him.
                         
                          BENNY
           You're really him. You're The Babe.

                          THE BABE
           - of Krash and a hundred other dopey
           names. Forget about that, we ain't
           got much time. I'm here 'cause you're
           in some kinda pickle, right?
                         
                          BENNY
           Yeah.
                         
                          THE BABE
           A baseball with my John Hancock on it
           went over a fence, and you can't get
           it back. Right?
                         
                          BENNY
           Yeah, right.
                         
                          THE BABE
           (clear and simple)
           Then just hop over there and get it.
           There ya go. Problem solved.
           (tips his cap)
           See ya, kid.
                         
          The Babe turns to go back to wherever he came from. Benny
          grabs his arm - shocked that he actually feels something
          "real."
                         
                          BENNY
           Wait! I can't.
                         
                          THE BABE
           Can't what?
                         
                          BENNY
           Go into that backyard.
                         
                          THE BABE
           Why not?
                         
                          BENNY
           There's a Beast back there.
                         
                          THE BABE
           What kind?
                         
                          BENNY
           A giant gorilla-dog-thing that ate one
           kid already.
                         
                          THE BABE
           Is that a fact? Listen to me, kid.

           This is your "big chance," and ya
           shouldn't let it go by.
                          (PAUSE)
           Remember those cards you got the other
           day?
                         
                          BENNY
           Sure, yeah, five Maury Wills all in
           the same pack.
                         
                          THE BABE
           What're the odds on that?
                         
                          BENNY
           About a zillion to one.
                         
                          THE BABE
           More even. Someone's tellin' you
           somethin', kid. And if I was you...
           I'd listen.
                         
                          BENNY
           Yeah, but what?
                         
                          THE BABE
           You're the one with the rubba legs.
           Figure it out.
                          (BEAT)
           You gotta do what your heart tells
           you, else you'll spend the rest of

                          BENNY
           You mean, I should hop that fence -
           and pickle with THE BEAST?!
                         
                          THE BABE
           Lemme tell you something... you
           remember that called shot homer I hit?
                         
                          BENNY
           Sure, the greatest most famous and
           legendary home run of all time.
                         
                          THE BABE
           Yeah, right, well said.

           Well, you think I knew I was gonna
           swat that?
                         
                          BENNY
           Sure ya did, Babe.
                         
                          THE BABE
           Not a chance. Matter of fact, all the
           way down to first I kept sayin' to
           myself, "you lucky bum."
                          (BEAT)
           Think about that, kid. I'll see ya
           later.
                         
          The Babe disappears back into the closet, then:
                         
           THE BABE'S VOICE
           Remember, kid. There's heroes and
           there's Legends. Heroes get
           remembered... but Legends never die.
                          (BEAT)
           Follow your heart, kid, and you'll
           never go wrong.
                         
          A RACKET in the closet matching:
                         
          INT. SCOTTY'S ROOM - DAY
                         
          KNUCKLES on glass. Scotty hurries sleepy-eyed to the window
          and opens it. Benny stands outside, holding a shoe box.
                         
                          BENNY
                          (WITH PURPOSE)
           I had a dream. Get dressed. We're
           goin' to the sandlot.
                         
          EXT. THE SANDLOT - DAY
                         
          The guys march toward the rising sun - across the sandlot
          behind Benny. Toward destiny.
                         
          THE GREEN FIBERGLASS FENCE
                         
          They stop here. Benny steps forward. He opens the shoe box.
          Laces on brand new P.F. Flyers. Moves for the fence. Scotty
          grabs his arm.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Benny - wait. It's okay, it was my
           fault. I'll just take whatever I get.
           You don't have to do this.
                         
                         
                          
                          97
                         
                         
                          
                         
          A look in Benny's eyes. Kismet.
                         
                          BENNY
                          (PREDESTINED)
           Yeah I do, Smalls. I have to.
                         
          Benny turns from him - swallows hard. Swings himself onto
                         THE
                         
          TOP OF THE FENCE
                         
          and balances - deciding.
                         
           THE BABE'S VOICE
           (in Benny's head)
           ...Follow your heart, kid, and you'll
           never go wrong.
                         
          Benny turns back one last time. Gives Scotty "Thumbs Up."
          With a pearl diver's breath - he plunges into...
                         
          EXT. BADLANDS - DAY
                         
          ...here. He stands fixed, staring hard 'neath the lean-to.
                         
                         DUST RISES
                         
          from thereunder. ORGANIC EXHAUST. The LAZY CLINKS of heavy
          chain links... The Beast is rising to its feet.
                         
                         IT MATERIALIZES
                         
          piece by piece: fore feet the size of a catcher's mitt, bulking
          head and shoulders, hulking flank and haunches.
                         
                         BENNY'S
                         
          mouth hangs open. He's frozen, staring at
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          and it's worse than Squints recounted... because it's real.
          This is the biggest dog that ever lived! 300 lbs. 4 1/2
          feet tall. And ugly. This was a bad idea. The Beast lingers
          8 feet away with slack in the chain.
                         
          THWOOOP! It spits something out, which rolls in the dirt...
                         STOPS EXACTLY
                         
                         BETWEEN THEM
                         
          A goo-slobbered ball. Dirty Beast-foam drips off, revealing
          the smeared signature, B A B E R U T H. "G'head kid, I dare
          you!"
                         
                          
                          98
                         
                         
                          
                         
                         A PICKLE
                         
          Benny measures The Beast. Times its ballooning chest.
                         
          The Beast's eyes glue to Benny. Flopping, hot-water-bottle
          tongue PANTS. Licks chops. Leather'd nose twitches - smelling
          for movement.
                         
                         THE TOE
                         
          of Benny's P.F. Flyer digs into the cracked earth.
                         
                         CLINK
                         
          the Beast leans forward - one chain link lifts from the ground.
                         
          SHTHUFT!
                         
          Benny spits, blowing his tanks.
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          bristles.
                         
                         BENNY'S EYES
                         
          widen, focusing.
                         
          WAR BREAKS OUT!
                         
          Benny goes for the ball.
                         
                         THE BEAST'S
                         
          knotted muscles quaver and UNCOIL.
                         
                         BENNY'S
                         
          P.F. Flyers leave behind tiny dust roosters.
                         
                         THE BEAST'S
                         
          claws dig deep furrows. FOG BANKS of dust spread out behind
          it. Forelegs gallop at flared, over-anxious angles.
                         
                         BENNY
                         
          leaves scrambling footprints. He slides - grabs the ball -
          "Pops-Up" Maury Wills fashion - heads back for the fence.
          The ball slips from Benny's fingers. Re-grabs it - shoves
          the ball in his teeth, freeing his hands for the leap up the
          fence.
                         
                         
                         
                          
                          99
                         
                         
                          
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          gains. SHNAPP! Jaws SHUT like a tripped bear trap.
                         
                         BENNY
                         
          springs off the ground. He's on the fence.
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          reaches chain's end - it goes taught. Breaks! The two foot
          length still attached to The Beast's neck bullwhips - the
          chain catches Benny in the butt.
                         
                          BENNY
           YOWWWWW!
                         
          He vaults over the fence.
                         
          EXT. SANDLOT - DAY
                         
          The gang looks up. A great shadow envelopes them.
                         
          THE BEAST IS LOOSE!
                         
          The guys turn to stone. Benny takes off.
                         
                          BENNY
           OOOOH SSSSHIT!
                         
          The Beast tears by the guys after Benny. The two vanish out
          of the sandlot.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           What're we waitin' for?! Let's go

          EXT. SIDEWALK - NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
                         
          Benny runs. The Beast is gaining. In its wake: dichondra
          lawns RIPPED to shreds. Scotty and the guys make tracks a
          block behind.
                         
          EXT. FIVE & DIME - DAY
                         
          On display: Pinwheels, Mailbox Propellers and Puddle-Jumpers.
          Benny flies by. The Beast follows. As they pass, contact:
          the whirly-gigs take off!
                         
          INT. CAR - TRAVELING - DAY
                         
          A MOTHER drives. In the passenger seat, her TODDLER fingers
          a "scooter-pie" in marshmallowy strings.

                          (BEAT)
           Big goggy.
                         
          The Mother looks out the passenger window.
                         
          ON THE SIDEWALK
                         
          Benny and The Beast run even. Then pull ahead.

          Benny's cookin'. The Beast follows - TRASHCANS SCATTER like
          bowling pins.
                         
          Scotty and the guys follow. All slow to check out the garbage
          bins... so many crushed beer cans.
                         
          Benny darts in the rear entrance to a "random" building. The
          Beast tears after him - KNOCKING the door off its hinges.
                         
          INT. BOYS CLUB AUDITORIUM - DAY

          comes sliding AT US across the waxed stage floor - from under
          the movie screen. He slides off the stage - into midair -
          lands on his feet. Splits up the aisle between the rows of
          folding chairs and blasts out the door.
                         
                         KIDS' HEADS
                         
          turn to watch him. KONG ROARS! They look back at
                         
          THE MOVIE SCREEN
                         
          where, just as Kong proclaims himself king over the dead T
          Rex,
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          Leaps through the center of the silver screen - leaves a 6
          foot hole - lands 20 feet down the aisle - CRASHES through
          the doors and disappears.
                         
          Moments pass. Our guys follow.

          EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY
                         
          Hot-rubber SQUEAKS from Benny's P.F. Flyers. The Beast's
          claws leave jagged scars in the concrete.
                         
                         CATS HISS
                         
          in terror and faint.
                         
          EXT. PUBLIC POOL DECK - DAY
                         
          POOL HONEYS lounge, all bedecked with rock-hard, Annette
          Funicello hairdo's.
                         
          Benny blasts out of the pool building, "tire stepping" over
                         
          the Honeys. They're up and RANTING at him. Until, The Beast
          comes...
                         
          ...sliding across the water-slippy deck like an out-of-control
          anvil. He "bowling pins" the Pool Honeys. The Honeys HIT
          THE WATER.
                         
          Benny cuts back through the pool building. The Beast follows -
          parting our guys and the other Kids.
                         
          EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD - DAY
                         
          Game in progress. From outta nowhere, Benny jams across the
          diamond. The game stops... EVERYONE gapes at:
                         
          Some huge dog-beast charging after a kid.
                         
          EXT. CITY PARK - PICNIC AREA - DAY
                         
          Big banner: "FOUNDER'S DAY!" Perfectly arranged picnic
          blankets covered with wonderful spreads of goodies.
                         
                         BENNY
                         
          zips under the banner - runs through - grabs a Coke like a
          long distance runner.
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          rages after him, through:
                         
          A DEADEND! MIDWAY
                         
          of neatly arranged display booths. (This is pie n' cake booth
          gag per storyboards - allow 2 pages.)

          Founder's Day parade (et al).
                         
                         BENNY
                         
          rips into the square. He rubba-leg zigzags, nimbly avoiding
          everything and everyone.
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          Is a runaway freight train. He PLOWS through CLOWNS. CHILDREN
          are snatched from the dog's path by terrified parents. The
          Beast tears through the concession stands:
                         
                         VATS & DISPENSERS
                         
          EXPLODE! The VOLUNTEERS dash out SCREAMING - "tar n' featherd"
          with baked beans and potato chips.
                         
                         BENNY
                         
          zips through the MARCHING BAND - ducking trombone slides -
          leaping glockenspiels.
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          ain't so graceful. He "barn-doors" the band. CRASH! An
          instrument tangled heap.
                         
                         THE ONLOOKERS
                         
          pour into the street, knocking the MAYOR from his convertible,
          and the FOUNDER'S DAY QUEEN from her float.
                         
          FROM THIS HEIGHT
                         
          this all looks like the end of a "Dr. Suess" book!
                         
          SCOTTY AND THE GANG
                         
          search through the confusion. _They've lost Benny_! Suddenly,
          doubling back on them
                         
                         BENNY

          Benny's gone. Seconds later - The Beast follows.
                         
                          SQUINTS
           This way! Shortcut!

          forges through the disaster.
                         
          EXT. THE SANDLOT - MR. MERTLE'S FENCE - DAY
                         
          The gang's GASPING for BREATH. And then, unbelievably
                         
          BENNY & THE BEAST
                         
          Are coming right at them! They race across the sandlot.
          Kill- anxious beast-drool splashes the seat of Benny's pants.
                         
                         THE BEAST'S
                         
          muscles flex.
                         
                         BENNY
                         
          just runs. He runs as if a big dog was chasing him. He
          lurches a step - RIP! A pants pocket flaps from an incisor.
                         
                          BENNY
           LOOK OUT!
                         
          He lays down the world's all-time most perfect SLIDE. He
          careens toward the bottom of
                         
          MR. MERTLE'S FENCE
                         
          hits it and, defying gravity, RUNS STRAIGHT UP THE GREEN
          FIBERGLASS PANELS!
                         
                         BENNY
                         
          jets upward, leaving smashed green fiberglass footsteps -
          standing out from the fence 90 degrees - the Donald O'Connor
          "Singin' In The Rain" trick!
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          sucks air - ROARS - EXPLODES from the ground - soars, gaping
          maw first, right for
                         
                         BENNY
                         
          who pushes off the top of the fence.
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          GNASHES up at Benny's heels - misses by an inch. He plummets
          toward the Badlands. Then, the unspeakable happens,

          THE BABE RUTH AUTOGRAPH
                         
          and comes tumbling down after the ball.

          EXT. THE BADLANDS - DAY
                         
          Benny HITS the dirt with a gut twisting THUD! Dust everywhere.
                         
          EXT. THE SANDLOT - DAY
                         
          The gang climbs the fence. They look down into
                         
          EXT. THE BADLANDS - DAY
                         
          where, when the dust clears, they see
                         
                         BENNY
                         
          holding the Babe Ruth Autograph up high like a trophy.
                         
                          BENNY
           I GOT IT!
                         
                         THE GANG
                         
          hops down and races over. Suddenly, from the
                         
                         FENCETOP
                         
          His shirt snagged:
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Help him! I'm stuck! I'm stuck! Help
           him!
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          is hanging from the fence. His chain has caught. He struggles -
          choking to death - right below Scotty.
                         
                         THE GANG
                         
          petrifies where they stand.

                         SCOTTY
                         
          tears his shirt loose. Scrambles to where The Beast hangs.
          Tries to lift the tow chain free - too heavy! He'll die in
          seconds.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Pick him up! Scoot him up so I can
           let him off!
                          (DESPERATE)
           COME ON!
                         
                         NOBODY
                         
          moves. They wanna but they can't!
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          goes for broke. He reaches out and puts his hand on The
          Beast's head.
                         
                          SCOTTY (CONT'D)
                          (CONTACT)
           Easy. Easy, boy.
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          whimpers. Scotty balances atop the fence. Grabs the tow
          chain. Lifts with all his might... his fingers bleed. The
          Beast goes limp. An inch. That did it! The beast falls.
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          goes with him - 8 feet to the dirt. The FENCE COMES DOWN -
          breaking the barrier to the sandlot. He lands on the ground
                         
          NOSE TO NOSE
                         
          with The Beast.
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          leaps to his feet.
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          rises with him.
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          freezes solid.

                         THE GANG
                         
          watches in horror.
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          scans them instinctively - He might kill them all where they
          stand.
                         
                         SCOTTY'S
                         
          about to load up his fruit o' da looms.
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          sticks his mammoth head right in Scotty's face. SNIFFS. That's
          it! The kid is lunch! His jowls part - hot BEAST-BREATH
          BLOWS Scotty's hair back.
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          closes his eyes.
                         
                         THE GANG
                         
          SLAP their hands to their eyesockets.
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          leans closer. Mouth opens. Cold-leather nose presses against
          Scotty's forehead. Then... He licks Scotty's face.
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          wipes away the Beast slob. He doesn't even have to kneel
          down to read the name on The Beast's "doggy tag." It says...
                         
          ...Hercules.
                         
          This time Scotty gives Benny "Thumbs Up."
                         
          UNDER THE LEAN-TO
                         
          Hercules digs, then stands away.
                         
                         THE GANG
                         
          steps closer. Look into the hole. Their faces light up with
          wonder. In
                         
                         THE HOLE
                         
          Are 150 baseballs.

          MR. MERTLE'S BACK DOOR
                         
          Scotty KNOCKS. MR. MERTLE answers the door. An old man with
          dark glasses. He comes out on the porch.
                         
           MR. MERTLE
           Hello?...
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Um, we brought your dog home.
                         
           MR. MERTLE
           Hercules? How'd he get out?
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Well, sir... um, we kind of, well,
           what happened was -
                         
                          BENNY
           - we hit a baseball into your yard.
           Then we tried to get it and -
                         
           MR. MERTLE
           - why didn't you just come to the
           door... I'd have gotten it for you.
                         
          Squints, Yeah-Yeah, Ham, DeNunez, Repeat, Timmy and Bertram
          faint.
                         
           MR. MERTLE (CONT'D)
           Well, thanks for bringin' him back.
                          (BEAT)
           Why don't you boys come in... we can
           talk about baseball.
                         
          INT. MR. MERTLE'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Fairly spartan, except for one room, where it seems that Mr.
          Mertle spends most of his time. He leads Benny and Scotty
                         INTO
                         
          THE BASEBALL ROOM
                         
          Mr. Mertle sits at a table. Benny and Scotty stare at the
          tabletop.

          It holds a scale model Baseball Diamond: green felt field and
          little bases, outfield wall and miniature player figures. A
          picture on the wall of Mr. Mertle and Babe Ruth.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           You knew Babe Ruth?
                         
           MR. MERTLE
           Yeah. And he knew me too.
                          (BEAT)
           They never let us play together, but
           we were friends. Good friends. He was
           almost as great a hitter as I was.
           But, he'd of told you he was better.
                         
          The picture is signed: "To Thelonius Johnson Mertle, the second
          greatest slugger I ever saw... Babe Ruth."
                         
          A baseball game on the RADIO. As each play is CALLED, Mr.
          Mertle's hands deftly put his tiny players in the correct
          positions. Mr. Mertle is blind.
                         
           MR. MERTLE (CONT'D)
                          (HOLDING BALL)
           This the one that went over my fence?
                         
                          BENNY
           Yeah.
                         
          Mr. Mertle brushes his fingers over the leather.
                         
           MR. MERTLE
           This is an old ball, boys. Really
           old.
                          (BEAT)
           Hercules gave it a good chewing, didn't

           Yes, sir.
                         
           MR. MERTLE
           You sound upset, son - what's wrong?
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Well, you see... that ball belongs to
           my stepdad... and, uh - it was signed
           by Babe Ruth.
                         
          Mr. Mertle shakes his head... hands the ball to Scotty.

           MR. MERTLE
           Hmm. Well, I'm sure your dad will
           understand.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           I don't think so.
                         
          On the RADIO, Wills steals second.
                         
           MR. MERTLE
                          (TO BENNY)
           Son, move Maury Wills to second base
           for me, will ya?
                         
          Benny moves the little figure to second base.
                         
           MR. MERTLE (CONT'D)
           If he steals third that'll be number
           100.
                          (TO SCOTTY)
           Helluva pickle you're in, boy.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Yes, sir...
                         
          Mr. Mertle retrieves something from a glass case. A baseball.
                         
           MR. MERTLE
           I'll make you a deal. If you boys
           come over once a week and talk baseball
           with me, I'll trade you balls.
                         
                          BENNY
           Well, that's really nice of you... but
           this ball really is signed by The Babe.
                         
           MR. MERTLE
                          (CHUCKLES)
           This one really is too... and all the
           rest of the '27 Yankees.
                         
          He hands his baseball to Scotty... Benny stares at it in
          disbelief.
                         
                          BENNY
           Oh my God - Murderers' Row.
                         
          As they ogle the ball:

           They're all there.
                         
          Scotty hands Mr. Mertle the chewed up Babe Ruth ball. Shakes
          his hand.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Deal.
                         
          On the RADIO, Maury Wills steals 3rd for his 100th stolen
          base. Scotty notices the wall clock:
                         
          EXT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Mom's car is in the driveway. Scotty goes up the walkway
          slowly. Benny just behind him. The gang lingers at the
          sidewalk. Scotty sets one foot on the
                         
                         PORCH
                         
          and Bill comes out. He looks none-too-pleased. He towers
          over Scotty. The gang hangs their heads.
                         
                          BILL
           This better be good.
                         
          Benny unpockets a little felt bag. Hands it to Scotty. He
          holds the bag up to a perplexed Bill, who opens it. He looks
          from Scotty to Benny and back again. Then...
                         
          ...stares down at the "Murderers' Row" ball.

          A BASEBALL sailing through the air. SMACK! it's caught in a
          brand new glove. Scotty's new glove. Scotty snap throws the
          ball back to Bill. He and Scotty are having a great game of
          catch.
                         
                          NARRATOR
           It was weird that Benny said Babe Ruth
           was like the Hercules of baseball, and
           then The Beast's name turned out to be
           Hercules.
                          (BEAT)
           It was also strange that Mr. Mertle
           had a Murderers' Row ball to replace
           the one signed by The Babe.

           Some people might say that it was all
           a coincidence... but looking back at
           it now, it seems like everything was
           connected, just like me and Benny.
                          (BEAT)
           It was like we were a part of the same

          Scotty's mom sticks her head out the back door. She smiles,

          all play as if, somehow, this may be the last time they ever
          get to be a team. As they play, they're "sponged" from the
          PICTURE in this order: Yeah-Yeah, Repeat and Timmy, Ham,
          DeNunez, Bertram, Squints, Hercules, Scotty, Benny.

           That was the last summer that we all
           got to play together.

           But it would stay with us forever.
           (as they all dissolve:)
           Yeah-Yeah's parents shipped him off to
           military school. Timmy and Tommy grew
           up to build skyscrapers. Ham went to
           college and became a pediatrician.
           DeNunez played triple A ball and never
           got to the majors. Bertram got really
           into the sixities and no one ever saw
           him again. Squints grew up and married
           Wendy Peffercorn; they bought the Five
           & Dime and they still own it to this
           day. Hercules lived to be 199 years
           old... in human years.

           After Benny pickled the Beast, his
           reputation spread all over town. From
           then on he was known as Benny "The

           That's a triple, and that'll put the
           winning run on third, with two out in
           the bottom of the ninth. What a shot!

          From the dugout, TOMMY LASORDA calls for a pinch runner. A
          PLAYER comes out of the dugout, stripping off his warm-up
          jacket.

           Lasorda's sending in a pinch runner -
           and it'll be...
                          (DRAMATIC PAUSE)
           I don't believe it! Lasorda's calling
           up the "Old Man" to pinch-run in the
           biggest clutch situation this season!
           They say the veteran's lost a step or
           two. But if I were you, I'd get ready
           for some fireworks.
                         
                         THE CROWD
                         
          is on its feet as 40-year-old BENNY "THE JET" RODRIGUEZ takes
          over third base from the PLAYER already there. They shake
          hands on the exchange. The 3rd base COACH walks over to The
          Jet. Pats him on the back.

          The Coach moves into the coaching box... turning his back to
          us. Emblazoned across his jersey, is the name W I L L S.
                         
                         THE PITCHER
                         
          takes the signal.
                         
                         THE JET
                         
          leads off 3rd base - ten steps! The Pitcher fires to 3rd.
          The Jet hand tags.
                         
                         THE PITCHER
                         
          settles.
                         
                         THE JET
                         
          leads off. Eleven steps.
                         
                         THE PITCHER
                         
          fires to 3rd again. The Jet gets back.
                         
                         THE JET
                         
          leads off again. Twelve steps. The pitch - strike. The
          CATCHER tosses it back. Just then...

          ...The Jet moves. So fast that no one knows he's gone till
          it's too damn late. The Pitcher awkwardly throws home. The
          Catcher wipes the baseline. Too late...
                         
          ...the dust clears. The UMPIRE eagle-wings the air.

          The tag missed by two feet. It's all over. The Crowd jumps
          to its feet. The Dodger dugout is all over The Jet.
