TITLE:
APOLLO 1  PRE-LAUNCH TEST -
CAPE KENNEDY,  FLORDIA -
JANUARY 27, 1967

MAN'S VOICE (on comm)
- Flight. We have the crew crossing gantry for capsule
ingress.

2ND MAN'S VOICE (on comm)
- Roger that.

WALTER CRONKITE (voice over)
- Inspired by the late President Kennedy, in only seven
years America has risen to the challenge of what he called
the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure on
which man has ever embarked. After trailing the Russians for
years with our manned space program...

[CRONKITE continues over ASTRONAUT]

ASTRONAUT
- We got a short.

ASTRONAUT
- Fire in the spacecraft.

SATURN TEST CONDUCTOR (STC)
(garbled - lost under CRONKITE)
- ...fire...

ASTRONAUT
- Get us outta here!

WALTER CRONKITE (voice over)
...and after that sudden horrible fire on the launch pad
during a routine test that killed American astronauts Gus
Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee, there were serious
doubts that we could beat the Russians to the Moon. But
tonight a mere eighteen months after the tragedy of Apollo
1, the entire world watched in awe as Neil Armstrong and
Buzz Aldrin landing on the Moon.

<font color="GREEN">[Here is how the movie
departs from the actual mission: The fatal launch pad
fire occurred on January 27, 1967, and the Apollo 11 moon
landing on July 20, 1969. Both dates are displayed correctly
onscreen, yet Walter Cronkite's opening narration says only
18 months elapsed between them.]</font>


EXT. HOUSTON SUBRUBAN STREET - NIGHT

JIM LOVELL is driving his red Corvette next to him in the
front seat sits a box.

<font color="GREEN">[Here is how the movie
departs from the actual mission: Jim Lovell's Corvette
was actually blue.]</font>


TITLE:
JULY 20, 1969 - HOUSTON, TEXAS

WALTER CRONKITE (on TV)
- A big good news came just a moment ago. Mission Control
gave the spacecraft permission to go for the extravehicular
activity, that is for the walk on the Moon far earlier than
anticipated - 9 p.m. Eastern daylight time...



INT. LOVELL HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

An Apollo-11 moon landing party is going on inside the
Lovell home.

JACK SWIGERT
- ...and the important thing when you're penetrating the
lunar module is your attitude and your relative speed. Now
let's say this is me here in the command module and this is
you...

TRACEY
- All right.

JACK SWIGERT
- ...in the LM. This thing sticks out here in front; that's
called a probe.

TRACEY
- Is that true?

JACK SWIGERT
- Absolutely. And, Tracey, I'll tell you, when you feel that
thing slide in, everything's clickin'. It's like no other
feeling in the world.

The entrance door opens and PETE CONRAD and JIM LOVELL
step in, JIM LOVELL is carrying a carton of Champagne under
one arm.

<font color="GREEN">[Here is how the movie
departs from the actual mission: Jim Lovell, Jack
Swigert, and Fred Haise were all in the MOCR during the
Apollo 11 moon landing.]</font>


PETE CONRAD
- A little liquid propulsion!

JIM LOVELL
- What's the big occasion?!

JACK SWIGERT
- Hey, How's it going over there at Mission Control?

JIM LOVELL
- It's a nervous time, they're pacing around, smoking like
chimneys, Gene Kranz is gonna have puppies. (turning to
Tracey) Jim Lovell.

TRACEY
- Hi.

JACK SWIGERT
- This is Tracey.

JIM LOVELL
- How do you do, Tracey?

JACK SWIGERT
- This... This is the man. Gemini 7. Gemini 12. Apollo 8.
They...

JIM LOVELL
- Stop it, Swigert.

JACK SWIGERT
- ... were the first ones around the Moon. This guy did 10
laps.

JIM LOVELL
- With one hand on the wheel. You, guys, make yourselves at
home. Hey, Marilyn!

JIM LOVELL makes his way through the guests and to the
kitchen.

MARILYN LOVELL
- Jim, where have you been?

JIM LOVELL
- This is the last Champagne in the city of Houston!

MARILYN LOVELL
- Very good. Good, good.

JIM LOVELL
- Everything else all right?

MARILYN LOVELL
- Everything's on course!

JIM LOVELL
- Looks okay... Hey, Cadet Lovell!

JAY LOVELL
- Hey, Dad!

JIM LOVELL
- Put this on ice in the back with the rest and make sure it
gets cold. You gonna get a haircut this summer?

JAY LOVELL
- I'm on vacation.

JIM LOVELL
- Oooh, get a haircut.

<font color="RED">["NIGHT TRAIN" performed by
James Brown plays in the background]</font>

WOMAN (in background)
- Well, hello there.


INT. LOVELL HOUSE - DEN

KEN MATTINGLY and FRED HAISE are looking at a number of
awards and pictures hung on the walls of the den of
Apollo-8's mission.

KEN MATTINGLY
- I wouldn't mind being up there tonight.

FRED HAISE
- God, who wouldn't? Don't worry. Our day's coming. They're
not gonna cut the program before number fourteen.

KEN MATTINGLY
- You know, my cousin called...

FRED HAISE
- Uh-Huh.

KEN MATTINGLY
- ... asked who we'd bribed to get on Jim Lovell's crew.

FRED HAISE
- Yeah?

KEN MATTINGLY
- I just told him: "They wanted to make sure he got the
best!"

FRED HAISE
- Well, they got that right.



INT. LOVELL HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

The guests begin to gather around the color television in
the living room.

JOHN YOUNG
- What network do we want?

EVERYBODY
-  Walter! Come on, put on Walter! Jules Bergman! John.
John, turn it up! Turn it up

WALTER CRONKITE (on TV)
- ...has completed putting on their spacesuits and the
boots, and they're now donning their...

Everybody has turned their attention to the news
telecast, except PETE CONRAD who stands up in front of the
TV and begins to address the partygoers.

PETE CONRAD
- Everybody! I... I really appreciate you all coming to this
dress rehearsal party for my Apollo 12 landing!

JIM LOVELL
- Sit down, Conrad!

PETE CONRAD
- Ah, I think we should all take a moment to... to recognize
the exemplary... hell...damn near, heroic effort displayed
by Neil Armstrong's back-up for this historic moon walk,
and, of course, his crew... Let's hear for... let's hear for
Jim Lovell, Ken Mattingly and Fred Haise!

The room fills with cheers and applause.

MARILYN LOVELL
- There he is! There he is! Everybody quiet down! There he
is! There he is!

JIM LOVELL
- Hey! Kids!

The room quites down as everybody is focused on the fuzzy
black-and-white TV image of the LM's ladder.

BUZZ ALDRIN (on TV)
- You got a good picture, huh?

BUZZ ALDRIN (on TV)
- Okay. Will you verify the position - the opening - I ought
to have on the camera?

NEIL ARMSTRONG (on TV)
- What?

CONRAD tries to break the tension.

PETE CONRAD
- Jim, do you think it's too late for him to abort?

JIM LOVELL
- No, no. He still has time to get out. He just needs
somebody to wave him off.

JIM LOVELL and PETE CONRAD
- Pull up now Neil! Pull up now! Pull up!

EVERYBODY
- Shhh!

The room quiets down as their attention is once again
focused on the TV images. JIM LOVELL is watching intensely
as he imagines what it must be like to step on the lunar
surface. The only sound that can be heard is that which is
coming from the television.

BRUCE McCANDLESS (CAPCOM for APOLLO 11) (on
TV)
- Okay, Neil, we can see you coming down the ladder now.

NEIL ARMSTRONG (on TV)
- Okay.

WALTER CRONKITE (on TV)
- Boy, look at those pictures. Wow!

NEIL ARMSTRONG (on TV)
- I'm at the foot of the ladder. The LM footpads are only
depressed in the surface about one or two inches. It's
almost like a powder.

WALTER CRONKITE (on TV)
- Armstrong is on the Moon. Neil Armstrong...

NEIL ARMSTRONG (on TV)
- ...I'm gonna step off the LM now...

WALTER CRONKITE (on TV)
- ... 38 year-old American, standing on the surface of the
Moon, on this July 20th, nineteen-hundred and sixty-nine.

NEIL ARMSTRONG (on TV)
- That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.

WALTER CRONKITE (on TV)
- His quote was:...

NEIL ARMSTRONG (on TV)
- I only go in a small fraction of an inch, maybe an eighth
of an inch, but I can see...

WALTER CRONKITE (over ARMSTRONG on TV)
- ..."That's one small step for man, one giant leap for
mankind!"



EXT. LOVELL HOUSE - BACK YARD - NIGHT

Looking up at the Moon, JIM LOVELL tries blocking the
Moon with his thumb, which entirely covers the Moon.


<font color="GREEN">[Here is how the movie
departs from the actual mission: The night of the Apollo
11 landing the moon was actually a waning crescent. And the
moon set at 11:54 pm CDT Houston time, before the moonwalk
was completed. So Lovell's scene where he holds his thumb up
had to happen well before the
moonwalk.]</font>

<font color="RED">["BEYOND THE SEA'" performed
by Bobby Darin plays in the background]</font>

MARILYN LOVELL state's the obvious.

MARILYN LOVELL
- You're drunk, Lovell.

JIM LOVELL
- Yeah, I'm not used to the Champagne.

MARILYN LOVELL
- Me neither. I can't deal with cleaning up. Let's sell the
house.

JIM LOVELL
- All right. Let's sell the house. They're back inside now,
looking up at us. Ain't that something?

MARILYN LOVELL
- I bet Jenny Armstrong doesn't get a wink of sleep tonight.
Ah, when you were on the far side on Eight, I didn't sleep
at all. I just vacuumed over and over again.

JIM LOVELL
- Christopher Columbus, Charles Lindbergh and Neil
Armstrong. Neil Armstrong. From now on we'll live in the
world when man has walked on the Moon. It's not a miracle.
We just decided to go. Apollo 8 - we were so close. Just
sixty nautical miles down and... Mmm. It was like just step
out, and walk on the face of it. I wanna go back there.

MARILYN LOVELL
- Where's my mountain?

<font color="RED">["GROOVIN'" performed by The
Young Rascals plays in the background]</font>

JIM LOVELL
- Well, it... It's right up by the... you see, okay... you
see the... where the shadow crosses the white area there?
That's the Sea Tranquillity. And your mountain's right there
on the edge of that. Your mountain. Your mountain, Marilyn.
Mountain Marilyn.

MARILYN LOVELL
- I don't see it.

JIM LOVELL
- Well, you gotta look harder... you look... While, I...

MARILYN LOVELL is sitting in a lounge as JIM LOVELL
starts to kiss her on her neck.

MARILYN LOVELL
- Jim... Jim...



EXT. VEHICLE ASSEMBLY BUILDING - DAY

The camera flies over the top of the VAB and stops on the
open hangar door with a partially stacked Saturn booster
sitting on the MLP.

TITLE:VEHICLE ASSEMBLY BUILDING - CAPE
KENNEDY, FLORDIA - OCTOBER 30, 1969

<font color="GREEN">[Here is how the movie
departs from the actual mission: The VAB was known as
the Vertical Assembly Building until the Space Shuttle era
when it became the Vehicle Assembly
Building.]</font>


JIM LOVELL
- The astronaut is only the most visible member of a very
large team. And all of us, right down to the guys sweeping
the floor are honored to be a part of it. What did the man
say? - "Give me a lever long enough, and I'll move the
world". Well, that's exactly what we're doing here.
This is divine inspiration, folks. It's the best part of
each one of us to believe that anything is possible. Things
like a computer that can fit into a single room and hold
millions of pieces of information. Or the Saturn V rocket.
This is the actual launch vehicle that will be taking Alan
Shepard and his crew on the first leg of the Apollo 13
mission.



INT. VEHICLE ASSEMBLY BUILDING - CAT WALK - DAY

Standing on a cat walk at the SLA level, JIM LOVELL is
conducting a tour of the VAB for a group of assorted
VIPs.

CONGRESSMAN
- When are you going up again, Jim?

JIM LOVELL
- I'm slated to be the commander of Apollo 14 sometime late
next year.

CONGRESSMAN
- If there is an Apollo 14... Now, Jim, people in my state
have been asking why we're continuing to fund this program -
now that we've beaten the Russians to the Moon.

JIM LOVELL
- Imagine if Christopher Columbus had come back from the new
world and no one returned in his footsteps.

VOICE ON PA SYSTEM
- Attention, all personnel!  Clear level three. Clear level
three.

A part of the CSM is lowered into position on top of the
SLA as the Saturn-V is being stacked in the VAB as the tour
watches.


<font color="GREEN">[Here is how the movie
departs from the actual mission: The mating of the
Saturn stages in the VAB happens much too
fast.]</font>

JIM LOVELL
- Are there any other questions?

WOMEN ON TOUR
- How do you go to the bathroom in space?

JIM LOVELL
- Well, I'll tell you. It's a highly technical process of
cranking down the window and looking for a gas station which
is... Oh, there's Deke Slayton. Deke, you might be able to
answer this lady's question better than I. Deke is one of
the original Mercury 7 astronauts, Ladies and Gentlemen. And
now he's our boss. He hands out the astronauts' flight
assignments, so naturally we kick back part of our salaries
to Deke every month. How much this month, Deke?

DEKE SLAYTON
- Jim, can I have a minute? Something's come up.

JIM LOVELL
- Sure, you bet... Henry.



INT. LOVELL HOME - DAY

The front door swings open as an excited JIM LOVELL
searches the house for someone to share the good news
with.

JIM LOVELL
- Hey! Anybody home?!

<font color="RED">["SOMEBODY TO LOVE" performed
by Jefferson Airplane plays from the stereo in Barbara's
room]</font>

A discussion is going on in BARBARA's room between
MARILYN and BARBARA LOVELL over holloween costumes.

MARILYN LOVELL (off camera)
- Definitely not!

BARBARA LOVELL
- I'm not being a cheerleader, mom!. You don't understand, I
worked so hard on this!

MARILYN LOVELL
- Barbara! Maybe, I don't understand, but you are not
wearing that out in this neighborhood! That's the end of
this. I don't wanna hear it!

Now SUSAN LOVELL decides to join the discussion.

SUSAN LOVELL
- She's not even wearing a bra. You can see everything!

BARBARA LOVELL
- Shut up!

MARILYN LOVELL
- Susan!

JIM LOVELL
- Hey, everybody!

MARILYN LOVELL
- Jim!

JIM LOVELL
- Marilyn. Trick or treat. You know that Easter vacation
trip we had planned for Acapulco?

MARILYN LOVELL
- Uh-oh.

JIM LOVELL
- I was thinking, there might be a slight change in
destination.

MARILYN LOVELL
- Really?

JIM LOVELL
- Maybe, say... the Moon... Al Shepard's ear infection has
flared up. And we've all been bumped up to the prime crew of
Apollo 13. Straight to the head of the line and the Fra
Mauro highlands.

<font color="GREEN">[Here is how the movie
departs from the actual mission: The actual reason for
assigning Al Shephard to Apollo 14 instead of Apollo 13 was
not his inner ear, but his lack of training, combined with
the relatively short time until launch. Flying Shephard on a
later flight would give his crew more time to
train.]</font>

MARILYN LOVELL
- Six months. You're moving up six months?

BARBARA LOVELL
- Dad! Can I please wear this?

JIM LOVELL
- Sure!

MARILYN LOVELL
- Jim!

JIM LOVELL
- No! No! Absolutely not!

BARBARA LOVELL
- This stinks!

MARILYN LOVELL
- They are not rushing things, are they? I mean, you're
gonna be ready in six months?

JIM LOVELL
- We'll be ready. Oh, hell, I wouldn't want to be around Al
Shepard tonight. I gotta get over there. We're gonna have to
get up the speed on this.

MARILYN LOVELL
- Go, go!

JIM LOVELL
- I'm gonna walk on the Moon, Marilyn.

MARILYN LOVELL
- I know. I can't believe it. And, naturally, it's thirteen.
Why thirteen?

JIM LOVELL
- It comes after twelve, Hon.



INT. MANNED SPACECRAFT CENTER - COMMAND MODULE SIMULATOR

TITLE:MANNED SPACECRAFT CENTER -
HOUSTON, TEXAS - 3 MONTHS PRIOR TO LAUNCH

TECHNICIAN
- Apollo 13, you are go for pyro arm and docking. All
systems are nominal and on the line.

JIM, KEN and FRED are in the CM simulator working on the
LM docking procedures.

FRED HAISE
- Okay. S-IVB is stable. SLA (SM/LM Adapter) panels
are drifting free. The drogue is clear. The docking target
is clear.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Okay, I'm coming up on that now. Two, one, mark.

FRED HAISE
- Seventy-five feet. We're coming up on docking.

Out at the sim console technicians are providing some
problems for the crew to work.

TECHNICIAN
- Let's shut down some thruster on 'em.

TECHNICIAN 2
- Let's see what he does with this one.

Back inside the CM simulator KEN notices something is
wrong.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Whoa. Wait a minute. I lost something here. I can't
translate up.

FRED HAISE
- Houston. We are drifting down and away.

TECHNICIAN
- Roger that.

JIM LOVELL
- Wanna just back off and make another run at this.

KEN MATTINGLY
- No. I got it. I got it. Let me... I'm just trying to get
it stable here.

FRED HAISE
- Houston. I'm gonna reset the high gain. (high-gain
antenna)

KEN MATTINGLY
- I've got the target back in the reticle. Okay. We're
stable. Go ahead and recycle the valves.

FRED HAISE
- Forty feet...

JIM LOVELL
- They're all gray.

FRED HAISE
- ... Twenty...

KEN MATTINGLY
- Easy.

FRED HAISE
- Ten feet...

KEN MATTINGLY
- Captured.

JIM LOVELL
- That's it... Ha! That's it.

FRED HAISE
- Wooo! Sweet move, Ken. Beautiful. Beautiful.

JIM LOVELL
- Gentlemen that was the way we do that.

FRED HAISE
- Oh, man. That woke me up.

13's primary crew is making their way down the steps from
the CM simulator as 13's back-up crew, consisting of JOHN
YOUNG, KEN MATTINGLY, and CHARLIE DUKE, wait to enter the CM
simulator.

TECHNICIAN
- Apollo 13 back-up crew. You're up in the simulator.

JACK SWIGERT
- Nice job, Jim.

JIM LOVELL
- That's 3 hours of boredom followed by seven seconds of
sheer terror.

NASA DIRECTOR
- Good job, guys. You just won the Christmas turkey.

FRED HAISE (to SIM TECH)
- Nice try, Frank. You really outfoxed them, brother.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Yeah, but it wasn't perfect. Used up too much fuel.

FRED HAISE
- Aw, you're above the curve.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Not by much. Listen, guys. I wanna work it again.

FRED HAISE
- Hey, we gotta be up with the dawn patrol headed for
Bethpage, what, 07:00.

JIM LOVELL
- Wheels up at 07:00.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Yeah, I know. But my rate of turn is still a little too
slow there, I really think we should work it again.

JIM LOVELL
- Well, let's get it right.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Okay. Set it up again, Frank.

TECHNICIAN
- Okay, thirteen back-up crew. It'll have to wait. Prime
crew's up for another run.

FRED HAISE
- Yeah, baby.



INT. COMMAND MODULE - SPACE

The crew in their space suits are in their couches
checking out the CM systems.

CAPCOM
- Apollo 13 we show S-IVB shut down, and all systems are
nominal. Fred, set the S-band (a frequency band used in
radar) Omni (omni directional antenna) to B and
when you get in the LM to forward.

FRED HAISE
- Good shape over here.

[Caution and Warning Alarm Sounds]

JIM LOVELL
- Hey, we got a problem. O2 (Oxygen) flow high, cabin
pressure, high.

KEN MATTINGLY
- I've got no suit pressure.

JIM LOVELL
- Ken, get your helmet on!

KEN begins to struggle with his helmet.

KEN MATTINGLY
- I can't get it locked.

JIM LOVELL
- Okay, we got a master alarm!

The glass on the indicators begin to break and float in
the CM.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Oh, God!... Help!

The CM's hatch is forced opened by the increased pressure
build-up in the cabin. Paper and other debris rush out
through the open hatchway. A blue hose connected to one of
the astronaut's space suits comes undone. JIM LOVELL is
hanging from the hand hold in the open hatch as oxygen
continues to rush past him and out into the vacuum of space.
Suddenly a support inside the CM breaks loose and flies
through the hatch knocking JIM LOVELL out into space. JIM is
tumbling helplessly end over end as he is separating from
the CM at a very high rate.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Jim!



INT. LOVELL HOME - BEDROOM - MORNING

MARILYN LOVELL
[wakes from dream]



INT. LOVELL HOME - JEFFERY'S ROOM - MORNING

As JIM LOVELL sits at the kitchen table across from
JEFFERY, MARILYN watches and listens from the doorway as JIM
tries to explain his upcoming mission and the Apollo-1 fire
to JEFFERY.

TITLE:MARCH 23, 1970 - 3 WEEKS PRIOR TO
LAUNCH

JIM LOVELL
- ... Something bad might happen. Stars will fall down on
you or something.

JEFFREY LOVELL
- That's silly. Stars can't fall on us.

JIM LOVELL
- Oh, you are a smarter kid than I was.

JEFFREY LOVELL
- How long will it take you to get to the Moon?

JIM LOVELL
- Four days... But that's pretty fast, you see. This is the
Saturn IVB booster, and it shoots us away from the Earth -
pshhh... It's fast, as a bullet from a gun. Until the Moon's
gravity actually grabs us and pulls us into a circle around
the Moon, which is called an orbit. All right? Fred and I
float down the tunnel into this guy - the lunar module. This
is a spidery-looking guy. Only holds two people. And it's
just for landing on the Moon. And I take the controls, and I
steer it around, and I fly it down, adjusting it here, the
attitude there, pitch, roll, for a nice soft landing on the
Moon. Better than Neil Armstrong. Way better than Pete
Conrad.

JEFFREY LOVELL
- Dad... Did you know the astronauts in the fire?

JIM LOVELL
- Yeah, yeah I did. I knew the astronauts in the fire, all
of 'em.

JEFFREY LOVELL
- Could that happen again?

JIM LOVELL
- Well, I'll tell something about that fire. Um... A lota
things went wrong...The door; it's called a hatch. They
couldn't get it open when they needed to get out. That was
one thing... And a... Well, a lot of things went wrong in
that fire.

JEFFREY LOVELL
- Did they fix it?

JIM LOVELL
- Oh, yes. Absolutely. We fixed it. It's not a problem
anymore.



INT. JIM'S CORVETTE - NIGHT

JIM and MARILYN are on their way to one of the many
"press-the-flesh" functions that all the
astronauts do from time to time.

MARILYN LOVELL
- I can't believe they still have you doing public
appearances.

JIM LOVELL
- Well, Henry Hurt was all over me.

MARILYN LOVELL
- I know, but...

JIM LOVELL
- I couldn't get away.

MARILYN LOVELL (cont'd)
- ... with the training schedule this tight. They shouldn't
be asking you.

JIM LOVELL
- It's the program, Marilyn. It's... you know, it's NASA.

[They stop at a red traffic light and a car pulls up
along side.]

<font color="RED">["I CAN SEE FOR MILES"

GUY IN CAR
- Hey! Hey, you're Jim Lovell, aren't you? Ha, ha! Hey,
lucky thirteen! Right on!

JIM acknowledges the driver with a smile. As the light
turns green the adjacent car revs it's engine and peels out.
Just as JIM is accelerating from the stop his car knocks and
stalls.]

JIM LOVELL
- Second time it's done that.

[restarts car]

MARILYN LOVELL
- So I was looking at the kids' school schedule coming up.

JIM LOVELL
- Yeah?

MARILYN LOVELL
- It's a very busy week. I'm thinking about not going to the
launch.

JIM LOVELL
- Huh!

MARILYN LOVELL
- The kids need me at home, honey.

JIM LOVELL
- Marilyn. We've had these kids for a while now. They've
never kept you from coming to the other launches.

MARILYN LOVELL
- Yes, but now we have your mother. She's just had this
stroke, and doing...

JIM LOVELL
- Oh, Mom's fine.

MARILYN LOVELL
- Honey, it's not like I've never been to a launch before.
The other wives' have not done three. I just don't think I
can go through all that... I'll just be glad when this one
is over.

JIM LOVELL
- Well, you're gonna miss a hell of a show.



INT. AIRCRAFT HANGAR - DAY

JIM is walking out of the hangar towards his plane that
he will fly to KSC for the launch.

PILOT
- Jim!

JIM LOVELL
- Hey, guys.

PILOT
- Take care.

JIM LOVELL
- See ya in a few weeks.

PILOT
- Bring us back a moonrock.

she hears a jet plane approaching and looks up to see it fly
overhead.



INT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER - PRESS ROOM

TITLE:APRIL 7, 1970 - CAPE KENNEDY,
FLORDIA - 4 DAYS PRIOR TO LAUNCH

JIM, KEN, and FRED are in their space suits having their
photo taken. They are standing in front of a large group of
reporters trying to answer some questions about the upcoming
mission.

REPORTER
- So the number thirteen doesn't bother you?

FRED HAISE
- Only if it's a Friday, Phil.

REPORTER
- Apollo Thirteen, lifting off at thirteen hundred hours and
thirteen minutes and entering the Moon's gravity on April
thirteen.

JIM LOVELL
- Uh... Ken Mattingly has been doing some scientific
experiments regarding that very phenomenon, haven't you?

KEN MATTINGLY
- Huh, Uh yes. Well I had a black cat walk over a broken
mirror under the lunar module ladder, it didn't seem to be a
problem.

FRED HAISE
- And we'd also considered a really helpful letter we got
from a fellow that said we oughta take a pig up with us for
good luck.

REPORTER 2
- Does it bother you that the public regards this flight as
routine?

JIM LOVELL
- There's nothing routine about flying to the Moon. I can
vouch for that. And I think that an astronaut's last
mission, his final flight... well, that's... that's always
gonna be very special.

REPORTER 3
- Why is this your last, Jim?

JIM LOVELL
- I'm in command of the best ship with the best crew that
anybody could ask for. And I'll be walking in a place where
there's four hundred degrees difference between sunlight and
shadow. I can't imagine ever topping that.



EXT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER - CRAWLER WAY - DAY

TITLE:APRIL 9, 1970 - 2 DAYS PRIOR TO
LAUNCH

JIM and WALTER are walking along side the crawler that is
transporting the Saturn-V to the launch pad.

<font color="GREEN">[Here is how the movie
departs from the actual mission: The crawler transporter
which carries a Saturn V out to the launch pad is very noisy
- it's rather difficult to even think about having a
conversation while it's going by. More important the Saturn
V is rolled out to the launch pad a couple of months in
advance, not two days before
launch.]</font>


WALTER
- We have that scheduled for 09:00 hours tomorrow.

JIM LOVELL
- That's not gonna work, Walter.

WALTER
- Why?

JIM LOVELL
- Freddo and I are gonna be going over the lunar surface
experiments tomorrow and Ken's gonna be back in the
simulator. We're gonna be going over the flight plan tonight
as well. (to crawler worker) I'm gonna pay a visit to
this beautiful machine after you hard down.

CRAWLER WORKER
- Okay.

JIM LOVELL
- Thanks.

A car pulls up along side the crawler. DEKE SLAYTON and
DR. CHUCK get out of the car and approach JIM.

DEKE SLAYTON
- Jim! We've got a problem!

DR. CHUCK (FLIGHT SURGEON)
- We just got some blood work back in the lab. Charlie Duke
has the measles.

JIM LOVELL
- So we need a new back-up.

DR. CHUCK (FLIGHT SURGEON)
- You've all been exposed to it.

JIM LOVELL
- Well, I've had the measles.

DEKE SLAYTON
- Ken Mattingly hasn't.



INT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER - NASA DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

JIM is pleading his case before everyone in the office
and he isn't winning anyone over to his side.

JIM LOVELL
- You wanna break up my crew two days before the launch.
When we can predict each other's moves, we can read the tone
of each other's voices.

DR. CHUCK (FLIGHT SURGEON)
- Ken Mattingly will be getting seriously ill precisely when
you and Haise will be ascending from the lunar surface to
rendezvous with him.

DEKE SLAYTON
- Jim, that's a lousy time for a fever!

JIM LOVELL
- Now. Now look! Jack Swigert has been out of the loop for
weeks!

NASA DIRECTOR
- He's fully qualified to fly this mission.

JIM LOVELL
- He's a fine pilot! But when was the last time he was in
the simulator?!

NASA DIRECTOR
- I'm sorry, Jim. I understand how you feel. Now we can do
one of two things here. We can either scrub Mattingly, go
Swigert. Or we can bump all three of you to a later mission.

JIM LOVELL
- I've trained for the Fra Mauro highlands... and this is
Flight Surgeon horseshit, Deke!

DEKE SLAYTON
- Jim, if you hold out for Ken, you will not be on Apollo
13. Your decision.



INT. SWIGERTS HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

The water is running in the shower as JACK and his GUEST
are uh, "showering".

[telephone rings]

<font color="RED">["MAGIC CARPET RIDE"

TRACEY
- Oh, let it ring.

JACK SWIGERT
- I gotta take that.

TRACEY
- Oh why?

JACK SWIGERT
- Because I'm on the back-up crew. The back-up crew has to
set up the guest list and book the hotel room... (into

KEN.

<font color="GREEN">[Here is how the movie
departs from the actual mission: The NASA worm logo
appears on a door - six years before it was

KEN MATTINGLY
- Well, I a... Damn. Medical guys. I had the feeling when
they started doing all the blood tests that... I mean, I
know it's their ass if I get sick up there but I mean...
Jesus!... Oh, boy... Swigert., he'll... he'll be fine.
He's... he's strong... It'll be a hell of a mission. One for
the books... You're sure about this, Jim? I mean, why don't
I go upstairs and talk to Deke? I'm sure we can work this
out.

JIM LOVELL
- This was my call.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Must've been a tough one... Look, I don't have the
measles. I'm not gonna get the measles.

[KEN MATTINGLY storms out of the room]

FRED HAISE
- Ken, Wait up!



INT. COMMAND MODULE SIMULATOR

JIM, JACK, and FRED are lying in their couches in the CM
simulator as they run though the procedure for entry.

JACK SWIGERT
- Trajectory's holding steady. We're right on the line.

JIM LOVELL
- Okay, we're into program-64 (Approach Phase program,
P-64). We're at 05 G's. So we're feeling that gravity
now.

FRED HAISE
- Houston, we are at four hundred thousand feet passing
entry interface.

PA ANNOUNCER
- About to loose signal. Re-entry data are nominal and we
have radio blackout.

JACK SWIGERT
- Okay... What's the story here?... I got a corridor light,
we're coming in too shallow. I'm going manual...

FRED HAISE
- Houston, switching to SCS (Stabilization and Control
System).

SIM TECHNICIAN
- Roger, Thirteen.

JACK SWIGERT
- Ok, we're three G's... Five G's... We're coming in too
steep. I'm gonna stay in this roll, see if I can pull us out
of it. We're eight G's... Nine... Ten... We're at twelve
G's.

JIM LOVELL
- Twelve G's. We're burning up.

DEKE SLAYTON
- Damn it!

SIM TECHNICIAN
- I gave him a false indicator light right at entry
interface. Even Mattingly didn't get it the first time.

JIM LOVELL
- How ya feelin', Freddo?

FRED HAISE
- Charbroiled.

JIM LOVELL
- So what happened?

JACK SWIGERT
- Came in too steep. We're dead.

FRED HAISE
- No shit.

JIM LOVELL
- Yeah, yeah. We were into program-67 there, so... Okay,
guys, we're gonna do this again obviously but give us a
minute to get our switches reset in here.

DEKE SLAYTON
- Jim, could we have a word?

JIM LOVELL
- Sure, Deke.

PA ANNOUNCER
- We're gonna drop off line and debrief with one of our...

DEKE SLAYTON
- So?

JIM LOVELL
- Well... If I had a dollar for every time they killed me in
this thing I... I wouldn't have to work for you, Deke...
Well, we have two days. We'll be ready. (to SIM TECH)
Let's do it again.

DEKE SLAYTON (to SIM TECH)
- Do it again.



EXT. LAUNCH COMPLEX - NIGHT

TITLE:APRIL 10, 1970 - NIGHT BEFORE

This is the last chance the astronauts will have to talk
to their families before launch, it takes place on the road
leading to PAD-39a with the astronauts and NASA technicians
on one side of the road and their families on the other
side.

FRED JR, and STEPHEN HAISE
- Mom, there he is!

FRED JR and STEPHEN make a mad dash towards their
father.

MARY HAISE
- Oh, Margaret get them! Fred, Stephen, come here.

FRED JR, and STEPHEN HAISE
- Daddy!

One of the NASA technicians catches them and keeps them
from getting across the road.

MARY HAISE
- We can't go across that road! We don't want Daddy to get
any of our germs and get sick in outer space, right?

FRED HAISE
- Hey, boys!

FRED JR, and STEPHEN HAISE
- Hey, Daddy!

FRED HAISE
- Not givin' your mom a hard time, are ya?

FRED JR, and STEPHEN HAISE
- No, Sir!

FRED HAISE
- (to MARY) Princess, you look beautiful!

WOMAN (off camera)

JIM LOVELL
- Watch the alignment now.

JACK SWIGERT
- Hey, don't worry, guys. I'm on top of it.

FD LOOP
- Fido, let me know when you're ready.
- Okay, let's uplink that.

JIM LOVELL
- How we looking, Freddo?

FRED HAISE
- We're not there yet.

FRED HAISE
- Forty feet... Twenty...

DEKE SLAYTON
- Come on, Rookie. Park that thing.

FRED HAISE
- Ten feet...

JACK SWIGERT
- Captured.

JIM LOVELL
- That's it. Talk back is barber poled

JACK SWIGERT
- Go ahead and retract.

JACK SWIGERT
- Houston. We have hard dock.



ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- Roger. Understand. Good deal, Jack.

FD LOOP
- Let's start back up with procedure 17.



FRED HAISE
- Okay, Houston, we have LM extraction.

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- We copy that, Thirteen. Now you're off to the Fra Mauro
highlands.

JACK SWIGERT
- I gotta get out of this suit.

JIM LOVELL
- Houston, we are ready for the beginning of the PTC
(Passive Thermal Control) and I think once we're in
that Barbecue roll, Jack and I will eat.

FRED HAISE
- Hey, I'm hungry.

JIM LOVELL
- Are you sure?

FRED HAISE
- I could eat the ass out of a dead rhinoceros.
[handover taking place in the MOCR]

EECOM - GOLD
- We got a smooth one, huh?

SY LIEBERGOT (EECOM - WHITE)
- By the numbers so far? We just ran a minimum load test on
the cooling system. Let me clean this up for you.

- See ya tomorrow.

MOCR OFFICER (off camera)
- Take care.


TITLE:DAY 3 - APRIL 13

JIM LOVELL
- Oh, it's too bad we can't demonstrate this on TV.

[JIM LOVELL urinates]

FRED HAISE
- What a shame!

JIM LOVELL
- Okay, overboard dump coming up.

[as the urine is vented into the vacum of space it
freezes instantly and creates a snow storm]

FRED HAISE
- Here it comes. The Constellation Urion.

FRED HAISE
- Now, that's a beautiful sight.

BARBARA LOVELL
- No! I'm never coming out! I hate Paul! No one else can
ever play another one of their records again.

SUSAN LOVELL
- She's still going on about the stupid Beatles breaking up.

BARBARA LOVELL
- They're not stupid. You're stupid!

MARILYN LOVELL
- Barbara! I know you're worried but...

BARBARA LOVELL
- I'm not going, Mom! Dad won't even know we're there.

MARILYN LOVELL
- The whole world is gonna be watching this broadcast, young
lady. And so are we.

JIM LOVELL
- Okay, good evening, America! And welcome aboard Apollo 13!
I'm Jim Lovell and we're broadcasting to you tonight from an
altitude of almost two hundred thousand miles away from the
face of the Earth. And we have a pretty good show in store
for you tonight. We are going to show you just what our life
is like for the three of us...

MARILYN LOVELL
- Susan, Barbara.

JIM LOVELL
- ... here in the vast expanse of outer space. Okay, one of
the first things we'd like to do is provide you with the
appropriate background music. So uh, hit it there, Freddo!

Command Module Odyssey, but there seems to have been a last
minute change in the program.

<font color="GREEN">[Here is how the movie

collection of Johnny Cash along.

HENRY HURT
- Hey, Marilyn.

MARILYN LOVELL
- Where's their broadcast?

HENRY HURT
- All the networks dumped us. One of them said we made going
to the Moon about as exciting as taking a trip to
Pittsburgh.

HENRY HURT
- We'll tell them when they get back.

JIM LOVELL
- ...don't ya Jack?

JACK SWIGERT
- Well uh, if anyone from the IRS is watching, I forgot to
file my 1040 return and I meant to do it today but...

SY LIEBERGOT (EECOM - WHITE)
- That's no joke! They'll jump on him!

FRED HAISE
- Well, folks, let's head on down to the lunar excursion
module. Follow me.

JIM LOVELL
- Now when we get ready to land on the Moon, Fred Haise and
I will float through this access tunnel into the lunar
module leaving...

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- EECOM. That... that stir's gonna be on both H2 and both O2
tanks, is that correct?

JIM LOVELL (continues off camera, under
KRANTZ)
- ... Jack Swigert to pilot the command module, but until
that time comes both ...

JIM LOVELL
- ... spacecraft will remain connected. Well, folks, as you
can probably tell the Aquarius isn't much bigger than a
couple of telephone booths. The skin of the LM in some
places is only as thick as a couple of layers of tinfoil and
that's all what protects us from the vacuum of space. We can
get away with this because the LM is designed only for
flight in outer space... Fred Haise; Renaissance man. Okay,
we'll head back up the tunnel now, and back into the
Odyssey... All right, we've returned to the command...
[loud BANG in spacecraft] Stand by one, Houston.

FRED HAISE
- Gotcha! Ha, ha!

JIM LOVELL
- Houston. The bang you heard was Fred Haise on the cabin
repress (re-pressurization) valve. He really gets our
hearts going every time with that one... Okay, we're...
we're about ready to close out the Aquarius and return to
the Odyssey. Our next broadcast will be from Fra Mauro on
the surface of the Moon... So, this is the crew of the
Apollo 13 wishing everyone back on Earth a... a pleasant
evening.

MARILYN LOVELL
- All right.

FRED HAISE, JR
- Daddy was funny.

HENRY HURT
- They might air a few minutes of it on the news tonight.

MARILYN LOVELL
- You'd think so.

HENRY HURT
- Bye.

BARBARA LOVELL
- Bye.



JIM LOVELL
- Well, between Jack's back taxes and the Fred Haise show,
I'd say that was a pretty successful broadcast.

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- That was an excellent show, Odyssey.

JACK SWIGERT
- Thank you very much, Houston.

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- We'd got a couple of housekeeping procedures for you, we'd
like you to roll right to zero six zero and null your rates.

JACK SWIGERT
- Roger that. Rolling right, zero six zero.

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- And if you could give your oxygen tanks a stir.

JACK SWIGERT
- Roger that.

[EXPLOSION]

JACK SWIGERT
- Hey, we've got a problem here.

JIM LOVELL
- What did you do?

JACK SWIGERT
- Nothing. I stirred the tanks.

SY LIEBERGOT (EECOM - WHITE)
- Whoa. Hey.

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- This is Houston. Say again, please.

JIM LOVELL
- Houston, we have a problem. We have a main bus B
undervolt. We've got a lot of thruster activity here,
Houston.

JACK SWIGERT
- What's the story with the computer now?

JIM LOVELL (answers SWIGERT)
- It just went off line.

JIM LOVELL (to HOUSTON)
- Uh, there's another master alarm, Houston!

JACK SWIGERT
- I'm checking the quads!

FRED HAISE
- Christ, that was no repress valve!

JACK SWIGERT
- Maybe, it's in Quad C.

JIM LOVELL
- We've got a computer restart!

JACK SWIGERT
- I'm gonna re-configure the RCS!

JIM LOVELL
- We've got a ping light.

JACK SWIGERT
- The way these things are firing it just doesn't make any
sense.

JIM LOVELL
- We've got multiple caution and warning, Houston... We've
got to reset and restart.

JACK SWIGERT
- All right, I'm going SCS...

DR. CHUCK (FLIGHT SURGEON)
- Jesus. Flight, their heart rates are skyrocketing.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- EECOM. What's your data telling you?

SY LIEBERGOT (EECOM - WHITE)
- O2 tank 2 not reading at all, tank 1 is at 725 psi and
falling. Fuel cells 1 and 3 are... Oh, boy. What's going on
here? Flight, let me get back to you.

GNC - WHITE
- Flight, GNC.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Go GNC.

GNC - WHITE
- Flight. They're all over the place. They keep going close
to gimbal lock.

TELMU - WHITE
- I keep losing radio signal, Flight, their antennae must be
flipped around.

GNC - WHITE
- ... do it manually, if they can do it at all.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- One at a time, people! One at a time! One at a time!
EECOM, is this an instrumentation problem or are we looking
at real power loss here?

SY LIEBERGOT (EECOM - WHITE)
- It's reading a quadruple failure. That can't happen. It's
gotta be instrumentation.

JIM LOVELL
- Let's get that hatch buttoned. The LM might have been hit
by a meteor.

JACK SWIGERT
- Yep!

FRED HAISE (to LOVELL)
- The tunnel's really torquing with all this movement.

FRED HAISE
- Houston, we had a pretty large bang there associated with
the master alarm.

FRED HAISE (to LOVELL)
- Shit, it's main bus A!

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- ... main bus A undervolt?

FRED HAISE
- Houston, we have a main bus A undervolt now, too... It's
reading 25 and a half. Main bus B is reading zip right
now... We got a wicked shimmy up here.



ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE) (under KRANTZ)
- Stand by one.

FRED HAISE (under KRANTZ)
- (intermittent voice with static)

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- EECOM, GNC. These guys are talking about bangs and
shimmies up there, don't sound like instrumentation to me.



ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- You are breaking up, Thirteen?

JACK SWIGERT
- Can't get this hatch seal!

JIM LOVELL
- Just...

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- We need you to switch to Omni...

JIM LOVELL
- Just stow it. If we'd been hit by a meteor, we'd be dead
by now.

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- ... Bravo.

JIM LOVELL
- I'm gonna try to get us out of this lurch.

FRED HAISE
- Houston, you're in the mud. Did you say switch to Omni
Bravo?

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- Roger that, Thirteen.

FRED HAISE
- Roger. And the signal strength on the high gain went way
down.

JIM LOVELL
- It's fighting me. What's the story here, Jack? We keep
flirting with gimbal lock!

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- Odyssey, we need confirmation, what systems do you have
down?

JACK SWIGERT
- Okay, Jim. SM RCS helium 1 - A and C are barber poled.

FRED HAISE
- I'm having a hard time reading you there. Did you say
switch to Omni Charlie?

JIM LOVELL
- Houston, I'm switching over Quad C to Main A.

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- Roger that, Thirteen.

JACK SWIGERT
- Okay, Houston. Fuel cell 1. Fuel cell 3. We got a main bus
B undervolt, cryo pressure, suit compressor. What don't we
have? AC bus 1, AC bus 2, Command Module computer, and 02
flow high. I... I don't know. Maybe, this is a caution and
warning failure.

JIM LOVELL
- Houston... We are venting something out into space... I
can see it outside of Window 1 right now... It's definitely
a... a gas of some sort.

JIM LOVELL (to CREW)
- It's got to be the oxygen.



ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- Roger, Odyssey. We copy your venting.

MOCR ENGINEER
- Give me an alignment

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Okay let's everybody think of the kind of things we'd be
venting.

SY LIEBERGOT (EECOM - WHITE)
- Okay now, let's start right back at the beginning.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Anything look abnormal on your system?

[GARBLED CHATTER AMONG MOCR ENGINEERS]

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE) (to
room at large)
- Okay, listen up... Quiet down, people... Quiet down! Quiet
down! Let's stay cool, people. Procedures, I need another
computer up in the RTCC. (Real Time Computer
Complex).  I want everybody to alert your support teams.
Wake up anybody you need. Get them in here... Let's work the
problem, people. Let's not make things worse by guessing.



ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- Thirteen, this is Houston. We are going around the room
now. We're gonna get you some answers.

JACK SWIGERT
- I'll tell you. We keep venting like this, we're gonna keep
hitting the edge of that dead band.

FRED HAISE (to LOVELL)
- Hey, take a look at the O2 on number 1... 200 pounds and
falling.



SY LIEBERGOT (EECOM - WHITE)
- O2 tank 2 still zero. Tank 1; 218 psi and falling.

JIM LOVELL
- Is that what you get? Confirm.

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- We're seeing the same, Thirteen.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Can we review our status here, Sy, let's look at these
things from a... from a standpoint of status. What have we
got on that spacecraft that's good?

SY LIEBERGOT (EECOM - WHITE)
- I'll get back to you, Gene.



FRED HAISE
- We're not gonna have power much longer. This ship's
bleeding to death.



SY LIEBERGOT (EECOM - WHITE)
- Flight.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Yeah. Go, EECOM.

SY LIEBERGOT (EECOM - WHITE)
- Uhm... Flight, I recommend we shut down the reactant
valves of the fuel cells.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- What the hell good is that gonna do?

SY LIEBERGOT (EECOM - WHITE)
- If that's where the leak is, we can isolate it. We can
isolate it there, we can save what's left in the tanks and
we can run on the good cell.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- You close 'em, you can't open them again. You can't land
on the Moon with one healthy fuel cell.

SY LIEBERGOT (EECOM - WHITE)
- Gene, the Odyssey is dying. From my chair here, this is
the last option.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, Sy... CAPCOM, let's have them
close the reactant valves.

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- Thirteen, this is Houston. We want you to close reac
valves on cells 1 and 3. Do you copy?

JIM LOVELL
- Are you saying you want the whole smash? Closing down the
reac valves for the fuel cells' shut down? Shutting down the
fuel cells. Did I hear you right?

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Yeah, they heard me right... Tell them we think that's the
only way they can stop the leak.

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- Yeah, Jim... We think that closing the reac valves may
stop the leak.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Did he copy that?

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- Do you copy, Jim?

JIM LOVELL
- Yes, Houston, we copy.

JIM LOVELL (to CREW)
- We just lost the Moon... Okay, Freddo, shut those down.

FRED HAISE
- Let's see what this does.

JACK SWIGERT
- If this doesn't work. We're not gonna have enough power
left to get home.

FRED HAISE
- Shit!



SY LIEBERGOT (EECOM - WHITE)
- God, damn it.



FRED HAISE
- Ah, Houston. O2 on 1 is still falling.

JIM LOVELL
- Freddo, how long does it take to power up the LM?

FRED HAISE
- Three hours by the checklist.

JIM LOVELL
- We don't have that much time.

FRED HAISE
- Shit!

JIM LOVELL
- Okay, now, Jack. Before the batteries completely die on us
in here, let's... let's power down everything so we can save
as much as we can for re-entry.



SY LIEBERGOT (EECOM - WHITE)
- Fifteen minutes oxygen and that's it. The Command Module
will be dead.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Okay. Okay, guys! Listen up! Here's the drill! We're
moving the astronauts over to the LM, we gotta get some
oxygen up there.

MOCR ENGINEER
- Right.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- TELMU, Control, I want an emergency power procedure, the
essential hardware only!... GNC, EECOM! When we're shutting
down the Command Module at the same time they have to
transfer the guidance system from one computer to the other,
so I want those numbers up and ready when our guys are in
position.

GNC - WHITE
- Roger that.

SY LIEBERGOT (EECOM - WHITE)
- Okay, we gotta transfer all control data over to the LM
computer before the Command Module dies.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE) (to
NASA DIRECTOR)
- The Lunar Module's just become a lifeboat.

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE))
- Odyssey, this is Houston. We need you to power down
immediately, you're gonna have to power up the LM at the
same time so you better get somebody over there.



JIM LOVELL
- We already have Freddo in the LM, Houston.

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- We've got serious time pressure here, Jim. You've gotta
get the guidance program transferred, you gotta do it before
you're out of power in the Command Module. Or you are not
gonna be able to navigate up there.

JIM LOVELL
- How much time? Can you give me a number?



ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- Well, we're looking at less than fifteen minutes of life
support in the Odyssey.



JIM LOVELL
- We've got fifteen minutes, Freddo, it's worse than I
thought!

JIM LOVELL
- Houston, beware I've moved from the Command Module into
the LM.



GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Now, if Jack can't get that guidance computer data
transferred before they go dead in there...

GLYNN LUNNEY (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - GOLD)
- They won't even know which way they're pointed.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- That's right.

GLYNN LUNNEY (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - GOLD)
- That's a bad way to fly.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- I'll be in (room) 210 if you need me.

GLYNN LUNNEY (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - GOLD)
- Okay.



JACK SWIGERT
- Houston, this is Thirteen. Are you... are you back with me
now?

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- Aquarius, this is Houston. You now have about twelve
minutes to power up.

FRED HAISE
- I can't see any stars. Man, there's a lot of debris
floating around out there.

JACK SWIGERT
- Okay, Houston. I've completed the steps on page 15. Now
I'm ready to power down the computer!

JIM LOVELL
- I'm gonna need your gimbal angles, Jack! Before you shut
down the computer!

JACK SWIGERT
- Okay, Jim!



GNC - WHITE (to CAPCOM)
- They read this back to me before they power down.

SY LIEBERGOT (EECOM - WHITE)
- Those number are...

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- All right, all right. I got it, I got it. Hold on.



FRED HAISE
- Houston, our computer is up.

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- Roger that. Stand by for a minute. Now, Jack. We need to
proceed from step 12 to 17 quickly... your down to about 8
minutes remaining.

JACK SWIGERT
- Fuel cell pumps off, O2 fans, tank 2 off.

JIM LOVELL
- Okay, Houston. Check me. I have completed these gimbal
conversions but...I need a double check of the arithmetic.

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- Yeah, you can go, Jim.

JIM LOVELL
- Okay, the roll CAL (calibration) angle is minus 2.
Lunar Module roll is 355.57. Pitch 1678. Correction, pitch
167.78. Yaw is 351.87.

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- Stand by, we're checking it.

JIM LOVELL
- We've got negative visibility in our star field, but if
this paperwork isn't right, who knows where we'll... we'll
end up out here.



TELMU - WHITE
- Looks good, Flight.

CONTROL - WHITE
- All right.

INCO - WHITE
- Good here.

GNC - WHITE
- He's good, Andy.

GLYNN LUNNEY (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - GOLD)
- Okay, we're go on those numbers.

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- You're good, Jim.

JIM LOVELL
- Log 'em in, Freddo.

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- Jack, turn off the IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit).
Switch to SCS. Stand by. Thruster ... (Ratty Comm)
... Over.

in every port. He has that reputation. I think he's sort of
foolishly optimistic though, taking nylons and Hersey bars
to the moon. Did you read that 3 million... What do you say,
less viewers or fewer viewers. 3 million fewer viewers... 3
million fewer viewers watch the space shot then did the last
one. I ...uh. Colonel Borman is...

- An ABC news...

[MATTINGLY turns off TV]

ANNOUNCER (on TV)
- ...here is ABC science editor, Jules Bergman.

JULES BERGMAN (on TV)
- The Apollo 13 spacecraft has lost all electrical power.
And astronauts Jim Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert are
making their way through the tunnels of the Lunar Module
using it as a lifeboat, so they'll have electrical power for
their radios on the Command Module. Apollo 13 is apparently
also losing breathing oxygen...

MARILYN LOVELL
- Slow down. An electrical failure...

JULES BERGMAN (on TV)
- ...and the astronauts may have to use the LM oxygen
supply.

MARILYN LOVELL
- ...what exactly does that mean?

JULES BERGMAN (on TV)
- ...The emergency has ruled out any chance of a lunar
landing and could endanger the lives of the astronauts
themselves. If the LM's oxygen supply plus whatever is left
of the Command Module's oxygen can't last them until they
can get back to Earth.

MARILYN LOVELL
- What do you mean there's no immediate danger. I just heard
they're losing oxygen. Can they get back?

JULES BERGMAN (on TV)
- The LM descent rocket engine will be used in aborting the
mission and getting the astronauts safely back to Earth.
Recapping what has happened now. The Apollo 13 astronauts
may be in grave danger...

- No, don't give me that NASA bullshit! I wanna know what's
happening with my husband!

JULES BERGMAN (on TV)
- (continues under MARILYN)



ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- ... we wanna switch control to the Aquarius now.

JACK SWIGERT
- Roger that!

JIM LOVELL
- Houston, wait!

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- And your down to about 5 minutes now, Jack.

FRED HAISE
- Whoa! The RCS isn't up yet!

JIM LOVELL
- Houston, beware! Our RCS isn't up here yet! We have no
attitude control on Aquarius!

GLYNN LUNNEY (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - GOLD)
- They don't have control? Did we miss a step here? Control,
what the hell happened?

CONTROL - WHITE
- What? I don't know.



JIM LOVELL
- We're all out of whack. I'm trying to pitch down, but
we're yawing to the left. Why can't I null this out.

FRED HAISE
- She wasn't designed to fly attached like this, our center
of gravity with the Command Module.

JIM LOVELL
- It's like flying with a dead elephant on our back.



GUIDANCE - WHITE
- Flight, Guidance. We're getting awfully close to center
(gimbal lock) here.

JANE CONRAD
- Marilyn... I'm sorry, Jeffrey's calling for you.

JULES BERGMAN (on TV)

of Jim McDivit. This has been a very close call, and we're
not out of the woods yet, not by a long shot.

- Computer off.

TELMU - WHITE
- We're clear.

CONTROL - WHITE
- We're go on the LM.

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- We confirm shutdown, Jack. Lunar Module now in control.

JACK SWIGERT
- Roger that, Houston. This is Odyssey. Signing off.

JIM LOVELL
- Freddo, we're gonna have to execute some sort of a burn
here, it's just a matter of when.

JIM LOVELL (to SWIGERT)
- Did they shut us all down in there?

JACK SWIGERT
- Yeah.

FRED HAISE (to CREW)
- Didn't think we'd be back in here so soon.

FRED HAISE
- Ah, Houston. How far off course do you project we are?
Over.



GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Okay, people! Listen up! I want you all to forget the
flight plan! From this moment on we are improvising a new
mission...

[KRANTZ turns on overhead projector and projector bulb
burns out]

MOCR ENGINEER (off camera)
- Oh, come on! Sorry about that... we'll get somebody to
look at that, there's got to be a bulb around here
somewhere.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- How do we get our people home... (drawing with chalk on
blackboard) They are here. We turn around, straight
back...

RETRO - WHITE
- Yes! Gene...

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- ... direct abort.

MOCR ENGINEER
- No...We can't do that...

JERRY (FIDO - WHITE)
- No, Sir, no, Sir, no, Sir. We get them on a free return's
trajectory. It's the option with the fewest question marks
for safety.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- I agree with Jerry. We use the moon's gravity, slingshot
them around.

RETRO - WHITE
- No, the LM will not support three guys for that amount of
time.

CONTROL - WHITE
- It barely holds two.

RETRO - WHITE
- I mean we've got to do a direct abort. We do it about
face. We bring the guys right home right now.

CONTROL - WHITE
- Get them back soon, absolutely.

JERRY (FIDO - WHITE)
- We don't even know if the Odyssey's engines even working
and if there's been serious damage to this spacecraft.

GUIDO - WHITE
- They blow up and they die.

RETRO - WHITE
- That is not the argument! We're talking about time! Not
whether or not these guys ...

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Hey, hold it. Let's hold it down. Let's hold it down,
people. The only engine we've got with enough power for
direct abort is the SPS (Service Propulsion System)
on the Service Module. What, Lovell has told us it could've
been damaged in an explosion, so let's consider that engine
dead. We light that thing up, it can blow the whole works.
It's just too risky. We're not gonna take that chance. And
the only thing the Command Module is good for is the
re-entry, so that leaves us with the LM... which means free
return trajectory. Once we get the guys around the Moon,
we'll fire up the LM's engine, make a long burn, pick up
some speed, and get them home as quick as we can.

RETRO - WHITE
- Gene, I'm wondering what the Grumman guys think about
this.

GRUMMAN REP
- We can't make any guarantees. We designed the LM to land
on the Moon, not fire the engine out there for course
correction.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Well, unfortunately, we're not landing on the Moon, are
we? I don't care what anything was designed to do, I care
about what it can do. So, let's get to work. Let's lay it
out, okay?

SY LIEBERGOT (EECOM - WHITE)
- Gene...



TITLE:DAY 4

MOCR ENGINEER
- Capcom, Flight, he says it'll be ready in time.

DR. CHUCK (FLIGHT SURGEON) (to CAPCOM)
- After this burn, we've gotta build some time in the flight
plan for them to get some sleep.

CAPCOM - GOLD
- Run it by the FAO.

DR. CHUCK (FLIGHT SURGEON)
- I've run it by the FAO.

MOCR ENGINEER
- Do we know how long we're gonna fire that PC burn?

NASA DIRECTOR (talking to SLAYTON &amp;
LUNNEY)
- He specifically wanted a quote from the Flight Director.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Who wanted a quote?

DEKE SLAYTON
- The President.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- The President?

GLYNN LUNNEY (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - GOLD)
- Nixon. He wants odds.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- We're not losing the crew.

NASA DIRECTOR
- Gene, I gotta give him odds. Five to one against. Three to
one.

GLYNN LUNNEY (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - GOLD)
- I don't think there that good.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- We are not losing those men!

GLYNN LUNNEY (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - GOLD)
- Control, how long are they gonna have to burn the engine
at PC+2?

DEKE SLAYTON (confidentally to NASA DIRECTOR)
- Look, tell him. Three to one.



CAPCOM - GOLD
- Expect loss of signal in less than one minute. When we
pick you back up, we will have your PC+2 burn data.

FRED HAISE
- Okay, roger that, Houston. We'll hear from you again at
acquisition of signal.

JIM LOVELL
- You wanna look?

FRED HAISE
- Oh, look at that.

JACK SWIGERT
- Wow.

CAPCOM - GOLD
- Aquarius, that's 30 seconds until loss of signal.

FRED HAISE
- Mare Tranquillitatis. Neil and Buzz's old neighborhood.
Coming up on Mountain Marilyn. Jim, you gotta take a look at
this.

JIM LOVELL
- I've seen it.

CAPCOM - GOLD
- Aquarius, this is Houston. Expect loss of signal in
approximately ten seconds.

JACK SWIGERT
- So long Earth. Catch you on the flip side.



JACK SWIGERT (on TV pre-flight interview)
- When you go into the shadow of the Moon and the Moon is
between you and the Sun, there you see stars that are more
brilliant than anything you have seen on the clearest nights
here on Earth. And then you pass into the lunar sunrise over
the lunar surface and... it must an awe-inspiring sight. I
can't wait to see it myself.

NEWS ANCHOR (on TV)
- The problem now is not there's so much question of
adequate oxygen supply but it is the rate of consumption of
water which is vitally needed for the cooling operations to
maintain the electronic systems and so forth.



FRED HAISE
- Look, it's Fra Mauro. I can see our landing site.

JACK SWIGERT
- Wow. Look at the Tsiolkovsky crater. I can't believe how
bright the ejecta blanket is.

FRED HAISE
- It's like snow... It's beautiful... That's Mare Imbrium to
the north.

<font color="GREEN">[Here is how the movie
departs from the actual mission: The Sea of Tranquility,
their landing site, and other features are all on the near
side, but they point out these features while they're
rounding the far side of the moon.]</font>




CAPCOM - GOLD
- Thirteen, this is Houston. We're reading your telemetry.
It's good to see you again.

FRED HAISE
- Good to see you too, Houston.

CAPCOM - GOLD
- We're picking you up at a velocity of 7'062 feet per
second, at a distance from the Moon of 56 nautical miles.
Stand by for your PC+2 burn data.

FRED HAISE
- Gotta tell you, I had an itch to take this baby down
though, and do some prospecting. Damn we were close.

JIM LOVELL
- Gentlemen, what are your intentions?... I'd like to go
home. We got a burn coming up. We're gonna need a
contingency if we lose comm with Houston. Freddo, let's...
let's get an idea where we stand on the consumables. Jack,
get into the Odyssey and bag up all the water you can before
it freezes in there... Let's go home.

CAPCOM - GOLD
- Aquarius, we've got some PC+2 burn data for you, fellows.



GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- So you're telling me you can only give our guys 45 hours.
It brings them to about there... Gentlemen, that's not
acceptable.

MOCR ENGINEER
- Gene, Gene. We gotta talk about power here...

CONTROL - WHITE
- Whoa, whoa, guys! The power's everything. Power is
everything.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- What you mean?

CONTROL - WHITE
- Without it they don't talk to us, they don't correct their
trajectory, they don't turn the heatshield around... we
gotta turn everything off. Now. They're not gonna make it to
re-entry.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- What do you mean everything?

CONTROL - WHITE
- With everything on the LM draws 60 amps. At that rate in
sixteen hours the batteries are dead, not 45. And so is the
crew. We gotta get them down to 12 amps.

MOCR ENGINEER
- Whoa. 12 amps!
- How many?
- You can't run a vacuum cleaner on 12 amps, John.

CONTROL - WHITE
- We have to turn off the radars, cabin heater, instrument
displays, the guidance computer, the whole smash.

JERRY (FIDO - WHITE)
- Whoa. Guidance computer. What... what if they need to do
another burn? Gene, they won't even know which way they're
pointed
.
CONTROL - WHITE
- The more time we talk down here, the more juice they waste
up there. I've been looking at the data for the past hour.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- That's the deal?

CONTROL - WHITE
- That's the deal.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Okay, John. The minute we finish the burn, we'll power
down the LM.

CONTROL - WHITE
- All right.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Now, in the meantime... we're gonna have a frozen command
module up there. In a couple of days we're gonna have to
power it up using nothing but the re-entry batteries.

MOCR ENGINEER
- Never been tried before.
- Hell, we've never even simulated it before, Gene.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Well, we're gonna have to figure it out. I want people in
our simulators working re-entry scenarios. I want you guys
to find every engineer who designed, every switch, every
circuit, every transistor and every light bulb that's up
there. Then I want you to talk to the guy in the assembly
line who had actually built the thing. Find out how to
squeeze every amp out of both of these goddamn machines. I
want this mark all the way back to Earth with time to spare.
We never lost an American in space. We're sure as hell not
gonna lose one on my watch!. Failure is not an option!



JOHN YOUNG
- Ken... Ken...

KEN MATTINGLY (waking from sleep)
- What? Uh?

JOHN YOUNG
- Good you're not dead. I've been trying to get in touch
with you for forty five minutes.

KEN MATTINGLY
- John? Jesus, John. What're you doing here?

JOHN YOUNG
- I gotta get you in the simulators. We got a ship to land.

KEN MATTINGLY
- What?

JOHN YOUNG
- There's been an explosion, oxygen tanks're gone, two fuel
cells're gone, command module's shut down.

KEN MATTINGLY
- What about the crew?

JOHN YOUNG
- Crew's fine so far, trying to keep 'em alive in the LM.
We're gonna have to shut that down pretty soon too. We got a
lota people working on numbers on this one, Ken. Nobody's
too sure how much power we're gonna have to hit re-entry.
The command module's gonna be frozen up pretty good by then.



CONTROL - WHITE
- You see, this ammeter rise over twenty at any point.
Power-up is no good. You see it spikes; that's sayonara for
the guidance computer, our guys can't re-enter, okay?

SIM TECH
- How much power do we have to play with?

CONTROL - WHITE
- Barely enough to run this (points to an original MR.
COFFEE) coffeepot for 9 hours.

<font color="GREEN">[Here is how the movie
departs from the actual mission: Mr. Coffee drip coffee
makers didn't exist in 1970.]</font>


SIM TECH 2 (on headset)
- John.

CONTROL - WHITE
- Go.

SIM TECH 2 (on headset)
- Yeah. Ken Mattingly just got here.

CONTROL - WHITE
- Copy. (to SIM TECH) He's here.



JOHN YOUNG
- They've been losing heat since the accident. They're gonna
start getting a lot of water condensation on the control
panels.

CONTROL - WHITE
- Ken... Glad you're here. You know what's going on?

KEN MATTINGLY
- Ah, John's brought me up speed. What do we have left in
the batteries?

CONTROL - WHITE
- We don't really know.

KEN MATTINGLY
- We gotta get started on some short cuts for power-up.

CONTROL - WHITE
- Yeah. You know how short?

KEN MATTINGLY
- Well, that's all in the sequences, John. If we can skip
whatever we don't absolutely need, and turn things on in the
right order, maybe...

CONTROL - WHITE
- I agree.

KEN MATTINGLY
- You start on a procedure?

CONTROL - WHITE
- Well, the engineers have tried but, I mean... it's your
ship, we gotta get you in there.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Okay. Frank. I need the sim(ulator) cold and dark.
Give me the exact same conditions they've got in there now
and I need the present status of every instrument.

SIM TECH
- You've got it.

KEN MATTINGLY
- I need a flashlight. That's not what they have up there.
Don't give me anything they don't have onboard.

SIM TECH
- Let's get the show on the road. Put him in space, fellas.



JIM LOVELL
- Okay, Houston. The Quad heater circuit breakers are open.

CAPCOM - GOLD
- Copy that.

FRED HAISE
- We're using the forward Omni when the earth's in the
window, and we're switching to aft Omni when we see the
moon.

CAPCOM - GOLD
- We copy that, Thirteen. Aquarius, we don't want you do
make any more waste dumps, the venting may pushing you off
course.

FRED HAISE
- Christ.

JACK SWIGERT
- What's up?

JIM LOVELL
- No more waste dumps. We're just gonna have to store it.
Jack, we're gonna need some more urine bags.

<font color="GREEN">[Here is how the movie
departs from the actual mission: The real reason for the
crew to stop urine dumps was to avoid a cloud of droplets
around the vehicle which would have confused radar tracking
from the ground. However the ground forgot to tell the crew
that it was okay to continue urine dumps after the tracking
was finished.]</font>


JIM LOVELL
- Okay, Houston. It leaves us with just the computer which
I'm shutting down now... And that's it... (to CREW)
We just put Sir Isaac Newton in the driver's seat.



MOCR ENGINEER
- Is it A.M. or P.M.?

GUIDO - WHITE
- A.M... very, very A.M.

DR. CHUCK (FLIGHT SURGEON)
- Haise is running a temperature and none of them have slept
since the explosion.

DEKE SLAYTON
- I can't order these guys to go to sleep...  could you
sleep up there?

MOCR ENGINEER
- It's gonna get awfully cold in there for those guys.



EECOM - GOLD
- Gene. We have a situation brewing with the carbon dioxide.

TELMU - GOLD
- We have a CO2 filter problem in the Lunar Module.

EECOM - GOLD
- Five filters on the LM.

TELMU - GOLD
- Which were meant for two guys for a day and a half.

EECOM - GOLD
- That's what I told the Doc.

DR. CHUCK (FLIGHT SURGEON)
- They're already up to eight on the gauges, anything over
15 and you get impaired judgment, blackouts, the beginnings
of brain asphyxia.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- What about the scrubbers on the command module?

EECOM - GOLD
- They take square cartridges.

TELMU - GOLD
- The ones on the LM are round.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE) (to
LUNNEY)
- Tell me this isn't a government operation.

EECOM - GOLD
- This isn't a contingency we're remotely looked at.

DR. CHUCK (FLIGHT SURGEON)
- Those CO2 levels are gonna be getting toxic.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Well, I suggest you, gentlemen, invent a way to put a
square peg in a round hole. Rapidly.



TECHNICIAN
- Okay, people. Listen up. The people upstairs handed us
this one and we gotta come through. We gotta find a way to
make this... fit into the hole for this... using nothing but
that.

TECHNICIAN 2
- Let's get it organized.

TECHNICIAN 3
- Okay, okay. Let's build a filter.

TECHNICIAN
- Better get some coffee going too, someone.

- Haise's family lives in El Lago, Texas. His wife, Mary, is
from Biloxi, Mississippi. When Fred Haise was growing up in
Biloxi, he may have looked ahead to a fine family but he
never dreamt of flying.

FRED HASIE (on TV pre-flight interview)
- I'd never flown really before I went into service and I
only went into the flying business as a means to getting a

HENRY HURT
- Good morning.

MARILYN LOVELL
- Henry! Don't you ever sleep?

HENRY HURT
- I... I have a request from the news people.

MARILYN LOVELL
- Uh-Huh.

HENRY HURT
- They're out front here. They wanna put a transmitter up on
the lawn.

MARILYN LOVELL
- A transmitter?

HENRY HURT
- It's a kind of a tower for live broadcast.

MARILYN LOVELL
- I thought they didn't care about this mission. They didn't
even run Jim's show.

HENRY HURT
- Well, it's more dramatic now. Suddenly people are...

MARILYN LOVELL
- Well if landing on the moon wasn't dramatic enough for
them, why should not landing on it be?

HENRY HURT
- Look. I... I realize how hard this is, Marilyn, but the
whole world is caught up in it and it's... the biggest story
since...

MARILYN LOVELL

look too good, Freddo.

FRED HAISE
- I'll survive.

JIM LOVELL
- There's some aspirin in the medical kit.

FRED HAISE

JIM LOVELL
- You're gonna find out soon enough.

FRED HAISE

JIM LOVELL
- Oh, yeah... Here you are...

FRED HAISE
- It hurts when I urinate.

JIM LOVELL
- Well, you're not getting enough water.

FRED HAISE
- I'm drinking my ration, same as you. I think old Swigert
gave me the clap. He's been pissin' in my relief tube.

JIM LOVELL
- Well... That'll be a hot one at the debriefing for the
flight surgeon. That's another first for America's space
program.

FRED HAISE
- Listen... Uhm... I've been going over some stuff and I'm a
little worried about this cold affecting our battery
efficiency. See we quit heating the glycol to save water and
power, so that's not helping us any.

JIM LOVELL
- So it could cost us amp hours on the back end?

FRED HAISE
- It's a possibility.

JACK SWIGERT (interupting HAISE &amp; LOVELL)
- I've been going over the numbers again. Have they called
up with a re-entry plan yet? Because  we're coming in too
shallow.

JIM LOVELL
- We're working on something, Jack. Just hold on.

JACK SWIGERT
- All right, all right.

FRED HAISE
- I can't remember the ratio to temperature. We've got no
references on board.

JIM LOVELL
- Well, let's see if Houston can pull up the mill specs
(Millitary Specifications) on it and we'll...

JACK SWIGERT (interupting LOVELL)
- Listen. Listen. Listen. They gave us too much Delta-V.
They had us burn too long. At this rate we're gonna skip
right out of the atmosphere, and we're never gonna get back.

FRED HAISE
- What're you talking about? How did you figure that?

JACK SWIGERT
- I can add.

JIM LOVELL
- Jack, they've got half of the PH.D's on the planet working
on this stuff.

FRED HAISE
- Houston says we're right on the money.

JACK SWIGERT
- What if they had made a mistake, all right, and there was
no way to reverse it . You think they would tell us? There's
no reason for them to tell us.

FRED HAISE
- What you mean they're not gonna tell us. That's bullshit!

JIM LOVELL

JACK SWIGERT
- Hey, don't tell me how to fly the damn CM, all right!

FRED HAISE
- You don't even know, do you?!

JACK SWIGERT

FRED HAISE
- Cabin gas return to egress, suit circuit relief to close,
CO2 canister select to secondary. All right, here it goes.

JACK SWIGERT
- I can hear air moving

JIM LOVELL
- Just breathe normal, fellas.

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- Aquarius, please advise on CO2 status.

JIM LOVELL
- Yeah, Houston. We're taking a look at those numbers right
now... We're still holding close to 15, Houston.

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- Roger that. Standing by.

JIM LOVELL
- Houston. The CO2 level has dropped to 9... and it is still
falling.

MOCR ENGINEER
- Yes. Yes.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Great job you guys.

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- It is good to hear, Aquarius.

ANDY (CAPCOM-WHITE) (to TECHNICIAN)
- And you, sir, are a steely-eyed missile man.



KEN MATTINGLY
- Okay, spacecraft control to computer.

CONTROL - WHITE
- Damn.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Damn... We overloaded. We used way too much power and
there must be a sneak circuit some place between steps 7 and
10.

CONTROL - WHITE
- All right. Which one has the leak?

KEN MATTINGLY
- No, not yet, John. It... The sequence was wrong. We just
have to go back and try 'em one at a time.

JOHN YOUNG
- You need a break, Ken?

KEN MATTINGLY
- If they don't get one, I don't get one.



BLANCH LOVELL
- Well, if it won't work, get me another one. My son's
supposed to be on.

ORDERLY
- I know, Mrs. Lovell.

MARILYN LOVELL
- Hi, Blanch.

BLANCH LOVELL
- They can't fix a damn thing in this place.

MARILYN LOVELL
- Blanch. It's Marilyn.

BARBARA LOVELL
- Hi, Grandma!

BLANCH LOVELL
- I was gonna see Jimmy.

MARILYN LOVELL
- I know. I know. We came to tell you something. There's
been an accident. Jimmy's okay. He's all right... But he's
not gonna get to walk on the moon.

BLANCH LOVELL
- Well, they said he was.

MARILYN LOVELL
- I know. I know, uhm... That was before. Now there's been
an explosion. And... they're all okay, they're all right.
But now they're just going to... try to figure out a way to
get them home. And... and it's a little bit dangerous.
(to SUSAN) Oh, sweetie.

BLANCH LOVELL (to SUSAN)
- Are you scared? Well, don't you worry, honey. If they
could get a washing machine to fly, my Jimmy could land it.

Mavericks plays on tape recorder]</font>

CAPCOM - GOLD
- Jack. You'll be happy to hear that we contacted President
Nixon, and he's gonna grant you an extension on your income
taxes since you are most decidedly out of the country.

JACK SWIGERT
- Roger that, Houston. That's wonderful news.

DR. CHUCK (FLIGHT SURGEON)
- Tell them they have to sleep. Haise is running a fever of
a 104.

CAPCOM - GOLD
- Thirteen. Listen, we've had another request from Flight
Surgeon that you fellas get some more sleep. He doesn't like
his readings down here.

JIM LOVELL
- Let's see how he feels about this. I'm sick and tired of
the entire Western world knowing how my kidneys are
functioning.

DR. CHUCK (FLIGHT SURGEON)
- Flight. I just lost Lovell!

CAPCOM - GOLD
- Uh, Thirteen. This is Houston. Jim, we just had a drop out
on your biomed sensors?

JIM LOVELL
- I'm not wearing my biomed sensors, Houston.

CAPCOM - GOLD
- Okay, Jim. Copy that.

DR. CHUCK (FLIGHT SURGEON)
- Flight. Now I'm losing all three of them!

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- It's just a little medical mutiny, Doc I'm sure the guys
are still with us. Let's cut 'em some slack, okay?



TITLE:DAY 6

GNC - WHITE
- Gene, it's not the velocity, it's the angle. I mean maybe,
they're still venting something and that's throwing off the
trajectory, but we are definitely shallow again. We're up to
a 5.9.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Damn It

RETRO - WHITE
- At this rate they nick the Earth's atmosphere and bounce
off into space, we'll never get them back.

RETRO - WHITE
- We need another burn to get them back in the entry
corridor.

GNC - WHITE
- Definitely another burn.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Another burn.

RETRO - WHITE
- Fire the engines and get them on course.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Copy that.



CAPCOM - GOLD
- Aquarius, this is Houston.

JIM LOVELL
- Houston, Aquarius.

CAPCOM - GOLD
- Jim, we've got another course correction for you.

JACK SWIGERT
- What's up?

FRED HAISE
- Something about another course correction.

JIM LOVELL
- We copy, Houston. Be advised it's gonna take Freddo and I
awhile to power up the computer for the alignment platform
if we have to fire the engine.

CAPCOM - GOLD
- Negative on that, Jim. We can't spare power for the
computer.

FRED HAISE
- We gotta do this blind?

JIM LOVELL
- Houston, without the computer, what do we use for
orientation?

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Now, come on. We gotta be able to give these guys
something up there.

GUIDO - WHITE
- Without power, we can't give them a read.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- I'm not talking about power, I'm talking about reference.

GNC - WHITE
- No, no. There's no references. We have a bunch of debris
up there.

JIM LOVELL
- Houston. What's the story with this burn?

CAPCOM - GOLD
- We're trying to hash something out down here, Aquarius.
Stand by.

JIM LOVELL
- Well. Now look, Houston. All we need to hold attitude is
one fixed point in space. Is that not correct?

CAPCOM - GOLD
- Yeah, roger that, Jim.

JIM LOVELL
- Well, Houston, we've got one! If we can keep the Earth in
the window, fly manually, the co-ax crosshairs right on its
terminator. All I have to know is how long do we need to
burn the engine... (to CREW) The shorter, the better.

CAPCOM - GOLD
- Roger that, Jim.

GNC - WHITE
- Can they fly it manually? And still shut it down on time
without the computer?

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- I guess, that's the best we can do, Glynn. We're out of
time.



NEWS ANCHOR (on TV)
- In order to enter the atmosphere safely, the crew must aim
for a corridor just two and a half degrees wide. If they're
too steep, they will incinerate in the steadily thickening
air, if they're too shallow, they'll ricochet off the
atmosphere like a rock skipping off a pond. The re-entry
corridor is in fact so narrow, that if this basketball were
the earth, and this softball were the moon, and the two were
placed fourteen feet apart, the crew would have to hit a
target no thicker than this piece of paper.



GLYNN LUNNEY (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - GOLD)
- Okay, people. On your toes. We're doing this one blind.

GRUMMAN REP
- Gene, I want you to understand we've never tried this
before, burn, cold soak, burn, cold soak, burn, manual
control.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Look, it will ignite, will it not?

GRUMMAN REP
- I just want you to know the engines never been tried like
this. That's all I'm trying to tell you.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Look, I know what you're trying to do, I guarantee you I
won't hold you personally responsible. If it lights, it
lights. Let Lovell do the rest.

GRUMMAN REP
- Okay.



NEWS ANCHOR (on TV)
- They're gonna burn the engines and steer it manually,
attempting to keep the earth in the window...



JIM LOVELL
-Okay, this gonna take all three of us. Freddo, you handle
the pitch. But on the translation controllers all backwards
so if the... the Earth starts drifting down you need to
thrust 'aft' not 'forward'. I'll do the same on mine with
everything else. We're gonna burn at 10 percent thrust for
thirty-nine seconds, Jack, you time us.

JACK SWIGERT
- Got it.

JIM LOVELL (to SWIGERT)
- Give us a count of the last ten seconds up to thirty-nine.
Let's not miss this.

JIM LOVELL (to HAISE)
- You up to this, Freddo?

FRED HAISE
- I'm with you.

JIM LOVELL (to HOUSTON)
- Standing by for corridor control burn.

CAPCOM - GOLD
- Okay, Jim. You can fire when ready. You are go for the
manual burn.

JIM LOVELL
- Okay, X plus button at 10 seconds. Mark.

FRED HAISE
- Come on, baby. One more burn.

JACK SWIGERT
- 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4...

FRED HAISE
- Ullage is go.

JACK SWIGERT
- ...3, 2, 1.

JIM LOVELL
- Ignition.

FRED HAISE
- She's burning!

JIM LOVELL
- Oh yeah.

JACK SWIGERT
- Master arm off.

FRED HAISE
- Okay, here we go!

JIM LOVELL
- Helium regulator on.

JACK SWIGERT
- RCS is go, 10 percent thrust.

JIM LOVELL
- Bring her around, Freddo.

FRED HAISE
- I'm trying, but it's draggin'

JACK SWIGERT
- 10 seconds.

JIM LOVELL
- All right. Drop it down, Freddo.



JIM LOVELL
- We're drifting! No hold what you've got. I'll roll it.
Back off.

FRED HAISE
- I can't get it stable.



FRED HAISE
- She's dancing all over the place!

JIM LOVELL
- Come to the right a little bit.

JACK SWIGERT
- 15 seconds.

FRED HAISE
- She's drifting, I'm losing attitude.

JIM LOVELL
- Okay. Hold it up there. Back No Freddo! Back!

FRED HAISE
- Shit. I'm losing it!

JACK SWIGERT
- 20 seconds.

FRED HAISE
- Bring the earth up.

JACK SWIGERT
- Forward, Fred, come on. Forward.

FRED HAISE
- Shit, Shit. I lost it!

JIM LOVELL
- Where is it? Where is it?!

JIM LOVELL
- 7:00 helium regulator's closed.

JIM LOVELL
- Bring it down, Freddo. Just nose it down

FRED HAISE
- Uh Okay,  I... I got it!

JACK SWIGERT
- 30 seconds.

FRED HAISE
- Okay, she's coming in.

JIM LOVELL
- Little farther, ease your touch. Damn it! Damn it, that's
mine. That's me around

FRED HAISE
- A little more. Come on, baby.

JIM LOVELL
- Come on. That's it. Hold it. Damn it.

JACK SWIGERT
- 5, 6, 7...

JIM LOVELL
- Back, back! That's it. Hold it. Steady.

JACK SWIGERT
- 8...

JIM LOVELL
- Steady.

JACK SWIGERT
- 9.

JIM LOVELL
- Shut down!... Houston, we have shutdown.

CAPCOM - GOLD
- That's close enough, Jim. Good work.



GRUMMAN REP
- I knew it! I knew it! How 'bout that LM, huh? How 'bout
it?

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- I guess you can keep your job.

GRUMMAN REP
- You betcha.



CAPCOM - GOLD
- Thirteen, stand by. We're evaluating our power usage on
that burn.



JIM LOVELL (to CREW)
- Well let's hope we don't have to do that again.



GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Gentlemen. You've given our guys enough to survive till
re-entry. Well done... Now we gotta get them in. Tell me
about the power procedures.



KEN MATTINGLY
- Here's the order of what I want to do. I want to power up
guidance, ECS, communications, warm up the pyros for the
parachute and the command module thrusters.

CONTROL - WHITE
- The thrusters are gonna put you overbudget on amps, Ken.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Well, they've been sitting at 200 hundred below for four
days, John, they gotta be heated.

CONTROL - WHITE
- Fine, then trade off the parachutes. Something.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Well, if the chutes don't open, what's the point?

CONTROL - WHITE
- Ken, you're telling me what you need, I'm telling you what
we have to work with at this point. I'm not making this
stuff up.

KEN MATTINGLY
- They're gonna need all these systems, John.

CONTROL - WHITE
- We do not have the power, Ken! We just don't have it.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Okay, I'm gonna go back and reorganize the sequencing
again and find more power. Let's start from scratch. Clear
the board.

CONTROL - WHITE
- I don't know where the hell we're gonna find it.



JULES BERGMAN (on TV)
- Apollo 13 Commander Jim Lovell has more time in space,
almost 24 days already, than any other man. And I asked him
recently, if he ever was scared.

JIM LOVELL (on TV pre-flight)
- Oh well, I've had an engine flame out a few times in an
aircraft, and I was kind of curious as to whether it was
gonna light up again, things of that nature, but uh, they
seemed to work out...

JULES BERGMAN (on TV)
- Is there a specific instance in an airplane emergency when
you can recall fear?

JIM LOVELL (on TV pre-flight)
- Oh, well, I'll tell you, I remember this one time. I'm...
I'm in a (McDonnell F2H) Banshee at night in combat
conditions, so there's no running lights on the carrier. It
was the Shangri-La and we were in the Sea of Japan, and
my... my radar had jammed, and my homing signal was gone
because somebody in Japan was actually using the same
frequency and so it was... was leading me away from where I
was supposed to be. And I'm looking down at that big black
ocean. So... I flip on my map light. And then suddenly zap
everything shorts out right there in my cockpit, all my
instruments are gone, my lights are gone, I can't even tell
now what my altitude is. I know I'm running out of fuel, so
I'm thinking about... about ditching in the ocean and I... I
look down there and then... in... in the darkness there's
this... there's this green trail, it's like a long carpet
that just laid out right beneath me, and it was the algae,
right. It was that phosphorescent stuff that gets turned up
in the wake of a big ship and it was... it was... it was
just leading me home. And... if my cockpit lights hadn't
shorted out, there's no way I had ever been able to see
that. So a... you a... you never know what... what events
are gonna transpire to get you home.

JULES BERGMAN (on TV)
- Okay. Spacecraft Commander Jim Lovell, no stranger to
emergency is he.



JACK SWIGERT
- How's it going, Fred.

FRED HAISE
- I'm okay.

[EXPLOSION]

JACK SWIGERT
- What the hell was that?

JIM LOVELL
- Let's hope it was just the (helium) burst disk.

JIM LOVELL
- Houston, can you confirm a burst helium disk?

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- We confirm that, Jim.

JIM LOVELL
- Houston, is that gonna affect our entry angle at all?

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- Negative. Your entry angle is holding at 6.24, Aquarius.

JIM LOVELL
- Houston, uh... we sure could use the re-entry procedure up
here. When can we expect that?

ANDY (CAPCOM - WHITE)
- Uh, that's coming real soon, Aquarius.

JIM LOVELL
- Houston... We... We just can't throw this together at the
last minute. So, here's what you're gonna do. You're gonna
get the procedure up to us whatever it is. And we're gonna
go over it step by step so there's no foul-ups. I don't have
to tell you we're all little tired up here. The world's
getting awfully big in the window.

DEKE SLAYTON
- Jim, this is Deke.

FRED HAISE (to SWIGERT)
- It's Deke.

JACK SWIGERT
- They don't know how to do it.

FRED HAISE (to LOVELL)
- Maybe, Jack's right.

JIM LOVELL
- Hello there, Deke, what's the story?

DEKE SLAYTON
- Jim, we're gonna get that power procedure to you, we're
gonna get it as soon as we possibly can. Ken Mattingly's in
the simulator right now.

JIM LOVELL (to SWIGERT)
- Ken's working on it.



KEN MATTINGLY
- Look. I know this sequence works, John.

CONTROL - WHITE
- The sequence looks good, we're just overbudget on the
amperage.

KEN MATTINGLY
- By, how much?

CONTROL - WHITE
- 3 or 4 amps.

KEN MATTINGLY
- God, damn it, John. Is it 3 or 4?

JOHN YOUNG
- 4.

CONTROL - WHITE
- 4!

KEN MATTINGLY
- 4 more amps... We know they have some power left in the LM
batteries, right?

CONTROL - WHITE
- Yeah.

KEN MATTINGLY
- We have an umbilical that provides power from the command
module to the LM.

JOHN YOUNG
- Right. It's back-up for the LM power supply.

CONTROL - WHITE
- I'm listening.

KEN MATTINGLY
- So... Reverse it. Reverse the flow and see if we can draw
these 4 amps from the LM batteries before we cut it loose.
Why can't we do that?

CONTROL - WHITE
- We don't have the procedure for that, do we?

JOHN YOUNG
- You're gonna lose a lot in the transfer, Ken.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Yeah, yeah. But all we're talking about here is 4 amps.



GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- I want whatever you guys got on these power procedures.

DEKE SLAYTON
- Gene. They're already...

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- I don't want the whole damn bible. Just gimme a couple
chapters. We gotta get something up to these guys.

DEKE SLAYTON
- They're working on it now.

FAO - WHITE
- I'll call over at the simulator and get an estimate...

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- God, damn it! I don't want another estimate! I want the
procedures! Now!



KEN MATTINGLY
- IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) is up. How am I
reading?

CONTROL - WHITE
- Fine so far.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Say again.

CONTROL - WHITE
- You're under the limit. Keep going.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Okay. Floodlights to fixed.  Okay. I'm bringing up the
guidance... Here we go... CMC (Command Module
Computer) attitude IMU, CMC source, CMC mode auto, and
we're on the computer.

CONTROL - WHITE
- Ken?

KEN MATTINGLY
- Go ahead.

CONTROL - WHITE
- Is your computer on now?

KEN MATTINGLY
- Up and running. How do we look? (no response)
John...

CONTROL - WHITE
- I think we've got it, buddy.



KEN MATTINGLY
- Arthur, my notes are clear on that last sequence, right?

ARTHUR (EECOM)
- Yeah!

GUARD
- Your from building 5 right?

JOHN YOUNG
- Excuse me, Gentlemen!

KEN MATTINGLY
- I was getting a little blurry there.



GLYNN LUNNEY (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - GOLD)
- Here's Ken. Here's John.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Good to see you, Ken.

CONTROL - WHITE
- This is the sequence.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Was it try on the hardware yet?

CONTROL - WHITE
- We didn't have time.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Aquarius, Houston. Do you read?

JIM LOVELL
- Yeah, we read you, Ken. Are the flowers blooming in
Houston?

KEN MATTINGLY
- Uh, that's a negative, Jim. I don't have the measles...
Jim, is Jack in there with you?

JIM LOVELL
- Yeah, stand by one, we gotta get him on comm.



WOMAN
- Put those on the table.

JANE CONRAD
- Oh, damn it! Thanks Jackie.

MARILYN LOVELL (to ARMSTRONG)
- I think it would really help if you could just distract
her when the heavy predictions come in.

NEIL ARMSTRONG
- Yeah, yeah. We'll give it a shot.

MARILYN LOVELL
- Thanks... Blanch. Blanch, these nice young men are gonna
watch the television with you. This is Neil Armstrong and
this is Buzz Aldrin.

NEIL ARMSTRONG
- Nice to meet you.

BUZZ ALDRIN
- Hi.

BLANCH LOVELL
- Are you boys in the space program too?



KEN MATTINGLY
- Okay, Jack. Give me a read back on that last procedure.

JACK SWIGERT
- Stand by, Ken... Ken, I'm a... Well, I'm having trouble
reading my own writing. I guess, I'm a little more tired
than I thought.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Don't worry, Jack. I'll talk to you through it. Okay, find
the main bus breakers on panel 11.

JACK SWIGERT
- Yeah, main bus breakers. Got it.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Close main bus B.

JACK SWIGERT
- Uh, Ken, there's an awful lot of condensation on these
panels What's the word on these things shorting out.

KEN MATTINGLY
- We'll just take that one at a time, Jack.

JACK SWIGERT
- It's like trying to drive a toaster through a car wash.



JACK SWIGERT
- Main bus B is closed.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Okay, Thirteen. We're coming up on entry interface.



JERRY (FIDO - WHITE)
- Flight. We're still shallowing up a bit in the re-entry
corridor. It's almost like they're under weight.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Now how could they be under weight?

RETRO - WHITE
- We didn't land on the Moon.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Rocks?

RETRO - WHITE
- That's affirm.

KEN MATTINGLY
- One more thing, Jim. While Jack's working on the power-up,
we'd like you  and Freddo to transfer some ballast over to
the command module.

JIM LOVELL
- Say again, Houston. Ballast?

KEN MATTINGLY
- That's affirm... We gotta get the weight right. We were
expecting you to be toting a couple of hundred pounds of
moonrocks.

JIM LOVELL
- Right, Houston.

<font color="GREEN">[Here is how the movie
departs from the actual mission: The real reason for
transferring transferring ballast from the Lunar Module to
the command module was to keep the command module properly
balanced (correct center of gravity) after they jettisoned
the Lunar Module and Service
Module.]</font>




KEN MATTINGLY
- Now, Jack.

JACK SWIGERT
- Yeah, go ahead, Ken.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Okay, now... Panel 5. Circuit breakers 'caution and
warning', main B closed.

JACK SWIGERT
- Main B closed... Master alarm off...

KEN MATTINGLY
- Okay, Jack. On panel 7, B mag (magazine) number 2,
power to warm up.

JACK SWIGERT
- B mag number 2. Power to warm up. Done.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Sequential logic1 and 2 on.

JACK SWIGERT
- Sequential logic... 2 on.

KEN MATTINGLY
- CM RCS pressure on.

JACK SWIGERT
- CM RCS pressurization.



TITLE:DAY 7

REPORTER
- As her husband prepares to jettison his lunar module
lifeboat, Marilyn Lovell waits with her children, her
neighbors, and we are told, Apollo 11 astronauts Neil
Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. Only the Lovell's eldest son,
Jay, is absent as he holds vigil with his classmates at the
St. Johns military academy in Wisconsin.



ANNOUNCER (on TV)
- ABC news science editor, Jules Bergman.

JULES BERGMAN (on TV)
- With a crippled command module and surviving by using the
LM's systems, there can be no easy maneuver. And their LM
lifeboat is doing things and working longer then it was ever
intended to. It's a race against time until splashdown...



KEN MATTINGLY
- Okay, Jack. We're ready to see if the computer will accept
uplink of the re-entry data now.

JACK SWIGERT
- Okay. The IMU's up. We got our eight-balls back.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Copy that.

JACK SWIGERT
- Okay, Ken... Uplink telemetry, command module to accept,
right?

KEN MATTINGLY
- That's affirm. Go ahead and try it.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Come on.

JACK SWIGERT
- Uplink completed.

CONTROL - WHITE
- Yeah. That's more like it!

GLYNN LUNNEY (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - GOLD)
- Let's go.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Take a look at your amps. How we doing?

JACK SWIGERT
- You got her back up, Ken. Boy, I wish you were here to see
it.

KEN MATTINGLY
- I bet you do.

FRED HAISE
- Way to go, Jack.



RETRO - WHITE
- Flight, this is RETRO.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Go, RETRO.

RETRO - WHITE
- Flight. We are looking at a typhoon warning at the edge of
the prime recovery zone.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Say again, RETRO.

RETRO - WHITE
- Flight. We are looking at a typhoon warning on the edge of
the prime recovery area, now this is just a warning, Flight,
it could miss them.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Only if their luck changes.



JACK SWIGERT
- Jim, we're ready for SM jettison!

JIM LOVELL
- All right, Jack. On 3... 1, 2. Upward thrust!

JACK SWIGERT
- We're loose!

JIM LOVELL
- Reverse thrust!

JACK SWIGERT
- We have service module jettison.

JIM LOVELL
- Okay, Houston, our Service Module is free. We're gonna
take a look at what we have here.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Copy that.

FRED HAISE
- There it is. I see it.

JIM LOVELL
- Oh. Houston. We're getting our first look at the Service
module now. One whole side of the spacecraft is missing.
Right by the high gain antenna the whole panel is blown out.
Right up... Right up to our heatshield.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Uh, copy that, Aquarius.

FRED HAISE
- It looked like it got the engine bell, too. Can you see
that?

JACK SWIGERT
- Oh, man. That's incredible.



DEKE SLAYTON
- The heatshield.



JULES BERGMAN (on TV)
- The heat will build up to as much as three or four
thousand degrees Fahrenheit. On a lunar re-entry flight the
heat approaches four thousand degrees.

NEIL ARMSTRONG
- So Blanch. Blanch, did... did Jim make Eagle Scout or not?

BLANCH LOVELL
- Yes, he did.

NEIL ARMSTRONG
- He did?



NEWS ANCHOR (on TV)
- If the heatshield is even slightly cracked, the extreme
cold could split it wide open. Worst of all, if the
pyrotechnics for controlling the parachutes have been
damaged, the chutes may not open at all causing the
spacecraft to hit the water not at a gentle 20 miles per
hour but at a suicidal 300.



WALTER CRONKITE (on TV)
- Perhaps never in human history has the entire world been
united by such a global drama. In New York city, thousands
of people have gathered to watch updates to the mission in
Time Square.



NEWS ANCHOR (on TV)
- Many countries offered help. And the State Department said
it would ask for it, if it were needed. The House and Senate
passed resolutions calling on the American people to pray
tonight for the astronauts.



WALTER CRONKITE (on TV)
- In Rome pope Paul led fifty thousand people in prayers for
the safe return of the astronauts. In Jerusalem, prayers at
the Wailing Wall...



JIM LOVELL
- It's about time to bail out of this ship, Freddo. Freddo?
You okay?

FRED HAISE
- I'm, uh, I'm freezing.

JIM LOVELL
- Can you old out just a little longer?

FRED HAISE
- As long as I have to.

JIM LOVELL
- Aw, come on.

FRED HAISE
- Damn.

JIM LOVELL
- It won't be long. Just a little while longer, Freddo...

FRED HAISE
- Yeah.

JIM LOVELL
- Just a little while longer. We're gonna hit that water in
the South Pacific, open up that hatch. It's 80 degrees out
there.

FRED HAISE
- 80 degrees.

JIM LOVELL
- You are a mess.

FRED HAISE
- Yeah.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Odyssey, Houston. How we doing, guys? We're closing in on
lunar module jettison. As you know, that is time critical.
We should be making our move into the command module. Let's
get the hatch buttoned up. And... when you get a chance let
us know how you're doing.

JIM LOVELL
- Roger that.

JACK SWIGERT
- Here, let me give you a hand there, Freddo.



JACK SWIGERT
- We're coming up on LM jettison.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Is everyone strapped in, Ken. We're getting real close.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Copy that, Flight. Thirteen, Houston. We're coming up on
LM jettison.

JACK SWIGERT
- Stand by.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Have you got everybody in the Odyssey?

JACK SWIGERT
- Yeah, Ken. I wanna check those pyro batteries one more
time... Okay, pyro batts look good. I don't think we have to
tie the other batteries.

JIM LOVELL
- Sorry, Jack. This is an old habit. I'm kinda used to
pilot's seat. She's yours to fly.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Okay. Odyssey. I wanna double check some re-entry
procedures right after we jettison the LM which is coming up
in thirty seconds.

JIM LOVELL
- What is that?

JACK SWIGERT
- Oh... I was getting a little punchy and I... I didn't
wanna cut the LM loose with you guys still in it.

JIM LOVELL
- That's good thinking.

JACK SWIGERT
- Stand by, Houston... We have Lunar Module jettison.

FRED HAISE
- She sure was a good ship.

JACK SWIGERT
- Farewell, Aquarius. And we thank you.



WOMEN
- Mary... It's almost time, honey.



RECOVER CREWMAN
- Flight 966, 406...



TITLE:USS IWO JIMA, SOUTH PACIFIC - APRIL
17, 1970

HENRY HURT
- Let me put it this way. The trajectory may be off, their
thrusters may be frozen, their guidance system might be
malfunctioning, their heatshield could be cracked, and their
parachutes might be three blocks of ice. Clearly we have got
some obstacles to overcome.

REPORTER
- Yeah, Okay. But now I'm asking you. When will we know?

HENRY HURT
- Blackout lasts for three minutes. If they're not back in
four, we'll know.



INCO - WHITE
- Velocity now reading 34'802 feet per second, range to go
2'625 nautical miles.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Copy that.



JACK SWIGERT
- Okay, Ken. We are aligned for re-entry. Jim, we're gonna
need that computer re-entry program. Fred, how are the
batteries looking?

FRED HAISE
- Okay. Batt A looks good.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Re-entry interface in one minute and thirty seconds.

FRED HAISE
- Batt B, no volts, amps are okay. Batt C, shit. No volts,
only two amps. They may die before the main chutes open.

JIM LOVELL
- Roger. Let's tie all the batteries onto main A and main B.



RETRO - WHITE
- Flight, they're still shallowing a bit up there. Do you
want to tell 'em?

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)GHT
DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Anything we can do about it?

RETRO - WHITE
- Not now, Flight.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Then they don't need to know, do they?

RETRO - WHITE
- Copy that.



HENRY HURT
- RETRO says the typhoon is still a presence in the splash
down area?

NASA DIRECTOR
- Yeah.

HENRY HURT
- Whata we got? the parachute situation, the heatshield, the
angle of trajectory and the typhoon, there's just so many
variables. I'm a little at a loss...

NASA DIRECTOR
- I know what the problems are, Henry. This could be the
worst disaster NASA's ever experienced.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- With all due respect, sir. I believe this is gonna be our
finest hour.

NASA DIRECTOR (whispers)
- Okay.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Expect entry interface in 45 seconds. And on my mark your
velocity will be 35'245 feet per second. Mark. 35 seconds to
entry interface.



JIM LOVELL
- Gentlemen. It's been a privilege flying with you.



KEN MATTINGLY
- Flight. We have loss of radio contact.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Roger that.

INCO - WHITE
- Expect to regain signal in three minutes.

MOCR ENGINEER
- It all depends on the heatshield.



JULES BERGMAN (on TV)
- Back to the Iwo Jima and our live cameras there. The Navy
recovery and rescue helicopters already airborne, circling,
waiting for first radar contact.

REPORTER (on TV)
- Coming up now on three minutes until time of drogue
(chutes) deployment... Standing by for any reports of
acquisition.



INCO - WHITE
- 1 minute and 30 seconds to end of blackout.



WALTER CRONKITE (on TV)
- No re-entering ship has ever taken longer than 3 minutes
to emerge from blackout. This is the critical moment. Will
the heat shield hold? Will the command module survive the
intense heat of re-entry. If it doesn't there will only be
silence.



JEFFREY LOVELL
- Mommy, you're squishing me.

MARILYN LOVELL
- Sorry, sorry, Jeffrey.



INCO - WHITE
- Okay, Flight. That's three minutes. We are standing by for
acquisition.

GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Copy that.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Odyssey, Houston. Do you read me? Odyssey, this is
Houston, do you read?



WALTER CRONKITE (on TV)
- Expected time of re-acquisition, the time when the
astronauts were expected to come out of blackout, has come
and gone. About all any of us can do now is just listen and
hope. We're about to learn whether or not that heatshield
which was damaged, if you remember, by the explosion three
days ago has withstood the infernal of re-entry.


KEN MATTINGLY
- Odyssey, this is Houston. Do you read me? Odyssey,
Houston. Do you read me?

INCO - WHITE
- Three minutes 30 seconds. Standing by.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Odyssey, Houston. Do you read me?... Odyssey, this is
Houston, do you read me?

INCO - WHITE
- That's 4 minutes. Standing by.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Odyssey, Houston. Do you read?

JIM LOVELL
- Hello, Houston. This is Odyssey. It's good to see you
again.

KEN MATTINGLY
- Odyssey, Houston. Welcome home. We're glad to see you.



WOMEN
- They made it, they made it!



DEKE SLAYTON
- Lunney!



JIM LOVELL
- Houston. We're at stable one. The ship is secure. This is
Apollo 13 signing off.



GENE KRANTZ (FLIGHT DIRECTOR - WHITE)
- Good job!

JIM LOVELL
- Our mission was called a successful failure. In that we
returned safely, but never made it to the Moon. In the
following months, it was determined that a damaged coil
built inside the oxygen tank sparked during our cryo stir
and caused the explosion that crippled the Odyssey. It was a
minor defect that occurred two years before I was even named
the flight's commander. Fred Haise was going back to the
Moon on Apollo 18, but his mission was canceled because of
the budget cuts, he never flew in space again. Nor did Jack
Swigert. Who left the astronaut corps and was elected to
Congress from the state of Colorado, but he died of cancer
before he was able to take office. Ken Mattingly orbited the
Moon as Command Module Pilot of Apollo 16, and flew the
space shuttle, having never gotten the measles. Gene Kranz
retired as director of flight operations just not long ago.
And many other members of Mission Control have gone onto
other things, but some are still there. And as for me, the
seven extraordinary days of Apollo 13 were my last in space.
I watched other men walk on the Moon and return safely, all
from the confines of Mission Control and our house in
Houston. I sometimes catch myself looking up at the Moon,
remembering the changes of fortune in our long voyage,
thinking of the thousands of people who worked to bring the
three of us home. I look up at the Moon, and wonder when
will we be going back and who will that be.
