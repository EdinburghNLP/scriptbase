THE CROW


      The CROW

     by

     Davis Schow

     based on a screenplay by
     John Shirley

     Based on the comic book
     created, drawn, and written by
     James O'Barr

     September 14, 1992

     FADE IN:

     EXT. CEMETERY - LATE AFTERNOON

     BOOM!  A crack of lightning illuminates the silhouette of a
     perched crow large in the f.g.

     TIGHT ANGLE - FRESH GRAVE

     As a spade smooths the walls of a new double-decker plot.

                    DIMITRI (O.S.)
          We're losing the light; let's pack
          it in.

     ANGLE - DIMITRI AND ALEXI

     TWO GRAVEDIGGERS.  Scoop digger parked f.g. towering gothic-
     style church b.g.  Rolls of astro turf.  They look up toward 
     the sky.

                    ALEXI
          Snow, maybe?

                    DIMITRI
          What, you gonna ski on this?

     He indicates the mound of fresh dirt.  Spits into the grave.

                    DIMITRI (CONT'D)
          Come on, let's bag this.  It's
          beer time.

     Alexi nods and unfurls the tarp over the dirt.

     LOW ANGLE TRACKING SHOT - FLOWERS ON GRAVES

     As we MOVE alongside a pair of canvas-sided combat boots, as the 
     wearer collects the most lively flowers from each grave in 
     sequence.

     TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW

     Cemetery DEFOCUSED b.g.  Large, glossy-black, the bird follows
     the arc of movement in the previous shot.  Ruffles its feathers
     as it begins to sprinkle rain.

     ANGLE - ELLY - RESUMING HER MOTION

     A dirty-blondish tenement KID of eleven, clad in a blend of cast-
     offs and hand-me-downs; her version of street punk chic.  She
     totes a skateboard under one arm (itself a berserk Jackson
     Pollock chaos of band stickers, silver marker and graffiti, with
     day-glo wheels), and transfers her impromptu bouquet so she may
     unzip a flap and hike up a ragged hood against the rain.  She 
     stops to watch the grave diggers pack up and EXIT b.g.

                    ELLY
          Guess the picnic got rained out.

     She looks down o.s. at --

     ANGLE - SHELLY WEBSTER'S GRAVE

     as Elly places the gathered flowers down.  Almost reverent.

     RESUME CROW ANGLE - ELLY B.G.

     as Elly takes a single white rose and places it atop the grave
     near Shelly Webster's.

     ANGLE ON GRAVE - AS ELLY LEAVES

     TILT UP from rose to the name: ERIC DRAVEN. Rain spatters the 
     granite, darkening it.

     EXTREME CLOSE-UP - CROW's EYE

     It blinks in its alien way.

     WITH THE CROW

     as it takes wing from it's unseen perch.  Lands stop Eric's
     headstone.  It pecks tentatively at the top of the monument.

     ANGLE - ELLY NEAR ERIC'S GRAVE

     She hasn't gotten too far before she notices the bird.

                    ELLY
          Oh, scary.

     The bird blinks at her from the headstone.
                    ELLY
          What are you, like, the night
          watchman?

     Another blink from El Birdo.

     CAMERA WITH ELLY -  BOOMING BACK HIGH

     as she exits the iron gates of the cemetery without looking
     back.  Brutal building facades, like dead eyes, and bad
     alleyways, like hungry mouths, are gradually revealed as we
     continue PULLING BACK to unveil that the cemetery is smack in
     the middle of the city.

     EXT. MAXI-DOGS - TWILIGHT - RAIN CONTINUES

     CLOSE-UP of a foot-long hot dog being drowned in mustard.

                    MICKEY (O.S.)
          What this place needs is a good
          natural catastrophe.  Earthquake,
          tornado...

     ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND MICKEY

     ALBRECHT is a black beat cop, 35, in a rain slicker.

     MICKEY is the grease-aproned entrepreneur of MAXI DOGS, a steamy
     open-front fast foodery.

                    ALBRECHT
          You gotta put the mustard
          underneath first.

                    MICKEY
          Maybe a flood, like in the Bible.

                    ALBRECHT
          Here, let me do it.

     He grabs the dog from Mickey.  Mickey puffs his cigar while he
     cooks.  Albrecht methodically spreads a napkin and performs
     surgery on the hot dog, coating the bun with mustard, rolling
     the dog in the bun.  Flashes Mickey a "gimme" look. 

                    ALBRECHT
          Come on... onion.  Don't cheap
          out on me.  Lotta onions.

     MOVING ANGLE - AS ELLY SKATEBOARDS TOWARDS MAXI DOGS

                    MICKEY
          Heyyy -- it's the Elly monster.

                    ALBRECHT
          How do you ride that thing on a 
          wet street?

                    ELLY
          Talent. Hi.

                    ALBRECHT
          Care for a hot dog?

                    ELLY
          You buying?

                    ALBRECHT
          I'm buying.

     Elly grabs the stool next to Albrecht.  They`ve done this routine before.

                    ELLY
          No onions though, okay?

                    ALBRECHT
               (horror)
          No onions?

                    ELLY
          They make you fart.

     Mickey laughs.  Spots Elly a Coke.

                    MICKEY
          What's goin' on, Elly?

                    ELLY
          I went to see a friend of mine.

                    MICKEY
          Well, how's your friend?

                    ELLY
          She's still dead.

     Albrecht and Mickey exchange a look re:  Elly's matter-of-
     factness.

     EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT (RAIN)

     Thunder KABOOMS o.s.  The crow pecks the top of the stone again
     and a chip of granite flies off, bang!

     EXTREME CLOSE - THE HEADSTONE

     as the crow pecks again and draws blood from the rock.

     CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

     A dot of blood on its ebony beak.

     LOW ANGLE - HEADSTONE

     A thin, watery trickle of blood wanders from the top of the
     stone towards the earth.  Rain does not interfere.  Lightning
     plays in the rolling cloud cover, b.g.

     RESUME THE CROW

     as it takes off from the gravestone, into the rain.

     CLOSE-UP - THE BLOOD

     It slowly fills the name Eric Draven into the rock.

     CLOSE-UP - FOOT TAPPER

     A LOW ANGLE like the SHOT introducing Elly's boot.  This time
     we see cowboy boots, leather chaps.  The foot taps.  Waiting.

     MEDIUM ANGLE - THE FOOT TAPPER

     as lightning strikes.  Just enough for us to see a figure in a 
     long duster and a cowboy hat.

     RESUME ERIC'S HEADSTONE

     DRAVEN fills with blood.  Blood continues groundward.

     NEW ANGLE - THE FOOT TAPPER

     Turning to meet FRAME as the crow alights on his outstretched 
     arm.  This is the SKULL COWBOY.  We glimpse the deathshead,
     beneath the brim of the cowboy hat.

     RESUME ERIC'S GRAVE

     as blood trickles into the turf at the base of the grave.

     TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW

     shaking off rain.  Watching intently.

     CLOSE-UP - THE SKULL COWBOY'S FREE HAND

     Black gloved.  It walks a flat silver throwing knife across it's
     knuckles, like a quarter somersaulting.

     RESUME ERIC'S GRAVE

     The turf stirs beneath the white rose.  Magically, a slim white
     parts the earth to grasp the rose.

     SKULL COWBOY POV - ERIC's GRAVE

     as the figure of Eric Draven stands up from behind his own
     headstone.

     LOW ANGLE (FROM GRAVE) - ERIC

     Pale.  Clad in cerements: cheap black burial suit, slit open in 
     back.  WHite shirt.  A nothing tie.  No shoes.  Rain sluices mud
     from his upturned face.  He looks to the sky.  Lightning.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - FOLLOW ERIC

     as he weaves to lean against a nearby tree.  Looks o.s.

     ERIC's POV - THE SKULL COWBOY

     water-blurred, through the rain, standing with the crow perched
     on his arm like a hunting falcon.  He releases it and it flies
     to the tree.

     ANGLE -  ERIC

     Watching this.  Wipes mud from his eyes, tries to clear vision.
     The crow lights in the tree and they meet eye-to-eye.  Eric
     looks back o.s. and we RACK to include the Skull Cowboy.

                    ERIC
          What the hell are you?

                    SKULL COWBOY
          Interested?  Follow the crow.

     NB.  The Skull Cowboy speaks in nicely distorted, buzzlike
     charnal house whisper.  Unsettling and hackle-raising.

     Eric turns back to the bird, which takes wing in the rain, His
     eyes follow it.  He looks back, disoriented, doubtful, but the 
     Skull Cowboy is gone.

     LOW DEEP ANGLE - THE CROW

     Taking wing in the rain, showing the way.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC

     alone in the cemetery.  After a moments hesitation, he lurches
     off, following the crow.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. ARCADE GAMES SUPPLY OFFICE - NIGHT - TO ESTABLISH:

     A candy-flaked muscle T-bird is parked at the curb.

     INT. ARCADE GAMES SUPPLY OFFICE - NIGHT

     A MOVING SHOT during o.s. lines.  Past dead video and pinball
     devices.  Pasta desk with an open briefcase, coffee cup,
     ashtray -- someone was just there.  Then past a WOMAN, trussed
     with duct tape to her office chair, gagged, hot fear in her 
     darting eyes.

     COMPLETE CAMERA MOVE to include SKANK, a blade-thin speed freak 
     with pattern baldness, always loud, jittery, a manic dust puppy.
     And T-BIRD, an arrogant Arayan, brush-cut iron pumper, who is
     prepping an incendiary.  He exhibits a small squeeze bottle of
     arson cocktail to Skank.

                    T-BIRD
          Uncle T-Bird's 100-proof
          accelerator.  I squirt you with
          this, you could jump in the 
          Detroit river and burn all the way
          to the bottom.

     INSERT A CLOSE-UP of the bomb in his hands as he works.  Silver
     canisters, an LED timer, wires.

                    T-BIRD (CONT'D)
          You know, Lake Erie actually
          caught on fire once, from all the
          crap in it.  Wish I coulda seen
          that.

     He CLICKS a switch.  PEEP.  LED countdown blurs.

                    T-BIRD (CONT'D)
          We're ready to rock.

     Skank notices the captive woman's handbag on the floor.  Picks
     it up.  Looks through it for valuables.

                    SKANK
          What about working girl?

     INTERCUT the woman's increasingly horrified reactions.

                    T-BIRD
          What about her?

                    SKANK
          I say we leave her here to fry,
          man.

     T-Bird looks casually at the woman.  Smiles hideously.

                    T-BIRD
          No.  Let's take her with us.

     ANGLE - THE WOMAN

     Her eyes bug in a terrified NO!

     EXT. STREET - MOVING - NIGHT

     As the T-Bird fishtails wildly around the corner and eats street.

     INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

     TB drives.  One eye on his digital watch (doing an equally
     fast countdown).  Skank wrestles their captive, the woman, in
     the back seat.

                    TB
               (pissed off)
          Skank, shut her the fuck up!

     SKank punches her and she sags.  Then he looks forward.

                    SKANK
          Whoaaa -- T-Bird, red light, red
          light!

     EXT. STREET CORNER NEAR MAXI-DOGS - NIGHT

     As the T-Bird slews wide, cutting sidewalk, scattering
     nightwalkers, immediately attracting everybody's attention.

     ANGLE - ALBRECHT - AT MAXI-DOGS

     Reacting, with a mouthful.

                    ALBRECHT
          Goddammit.

     Mickey grabs the counter phone instantly.

                    MICKEY
          Call it in?

     Albrecht is off and running for the corner already.

                    ALBRECHT
          Yeah, do it!
               (to Elly)
          Stay right there!

     HOLD ON MICKEY.  He points at Albrecht's hot dog.  Yecch.

                    MICKEY
               (yelling after)
          You want I should save this for
          you?

     EXT. MOUTH OF ALLEY ACROSS FROM CEMETERY - NIGHT

     The car slides to a nose-down panic stop.

                    SKANK (O.S.)
          Dump her, man, dump her!

     The woman comes tumbling from the car, which blasts off with a
     war hoop from the guys inside.

     ANGLE - CORNER - ON ALBRECHT

     Gun out, hauling ass on wet pavement.  Aims at the departing
     car.  Gives it up.  Still too far away.  Pedestrians in the way.

     ANGLE - THE WOMAN

     hurting, cut, bleeding, tottering toward the dumpster.  Duct tape 
     stuck to her face but cut away around her mouth.  With her as
     she falls into the alley darkness... straight into the arms of

     CLOSE TWO-SHOT - ERIC AND THE WOMAN

     Their eyes lock.  Eric stiffens with his first FLASH.

     NB:  Eric's flashes of past memory are conditioned by the nature
     of things with which he makes physical contact.  Hints and
     fragments in fierce, super-saturated COLOR.  Puzzle pieces he
     must assemble.  Each flash keynoted by a BLOWBACK NOISE and 
     accompanied by a degree of pain.  It hurts to remember.

     FLASH:  INT. T-BIRD - WOMAN'S STRUGGLE

     The faces of Skank and T-Bird are murky, ephemeral, their voices
     hideous, distorted echoes.  A knife snaps open.  We see the 
     blade.  Blood.  Skank hits her, pow! and --

                    FLASH ENDS.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND WOMAN

     An airborne crow POV spiralling up and away from them.

                                   MATCH WITH:

     ANGLE - THE CROW

     perched on a fire escape, high above, watching and waiting.

     ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AND WOMAN

     She fades.  He lets her drop away, horrified.  And staggers back
     into the cover of the alley.  Her blood is on his hands.

     ANGLE - ALBRECHT RUNNING

     Skidding in, spotting the woman.  Kneeling to her.

                    ALBRECHT
          Here now!  You're gonna be okay!
          Can you understand me?  I'm a
          police officer...

     The woman is no longer in pain.  Deathly calm now.

                    WOMAN
          He touched me and it stopped.  The
          pain.

                    ALBRECHT
          What did you say?

                    WOMAN
          I saw a ghost...

     Her eyes roll back and she dies in Albrecht's arms.

                    ALBRECHT
          Oh no... don't go, darlin', you
          stay with me, now... shit!

     HIGH ANGLE CROW POV - THE ALLEY

     BOOMING BACK from Albrecht, the woman, onlookers, as police
     units screech up to assist.

     EXT. ALLEY BEHIND ARCADES GAMES SUPPLY HOUSE - ON ERIC - NIGHT

     Eric in lurching flight, panting.  Stops and steadies against
     the wall across from the backside of Arcade Games.

     ANGLE - THE CROW (FLYING)

     Circling, then lighting on the fire escape above Eric.

     BACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES - ("CROWVISION")

     "CROWVISION" is what the crow "gives" Eric to see.  Visually 
     distinct and immediately identifiable.

     ERIC'S POV - BACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES

     Which he's already seen through the crow's eyes.

     ANGLE - ERIC

     looking up at the crow.  Disoriented.  Doesn't understand.
     Suddenly he cottons, and covers his eyes just in time to shield
     from:

     ANGLE - BACK OF ARCADE GAMES

     The rear windows EXPLODING outward in a spray of fire and
     debris.

     ANGLE - WITH ERIC

     he reels back, crashes into a dumpster.  Falls.

     ANGLE - THE CROW

     landing on the dumpsters edge near a pair of discarded combat
     boots in the trash.  Flames.

     LOW ANGLE - ERIC

     The blood from his hands mars his burial shirt.  He tears the
     shirt away, leaving his tie absurdly intact.  Wipes his face
     with his shirt.  Discards it.  Stops, held by his discovery --

     PUSH IN ON ERIC

     as his fingers explore the five puckered bullet punctures in his
     chest.  Almost a circle.  Comically, he feels his back foe exit
     wounds.  Then hauls himself upright, coming level with the crow.
     His glance at the bird is almost accusatory.

     ANGLE - THe CROW

     Inscrutable.  We should get the idea that some silent
     communication is taking place.

     ANGLE - ERIC'S FEET 

     bare, muddied, frozen.  TILT to Eric.  His gaze moves from the
     crow to the boots in the trash.  He grabs them, pushes them onto
     his bare feet.  His eyes catch the firelight.  Distant o.s.
     SIRENS

                    ERIC
          Fire.  In the rain.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. CLUB TRASH - NIGHT

     We are now within the neon techno-depths of Club Trash.  The BG
     music is hard, savage, primal:  a doom-laden Radio Werewolf band
     rules.  Cabaret Blitzkrieg, packed with Death-to-Yup
     trendazoids.  We'll see more of this circus later.  Right now
     the BG SOUND is our biggest clue to the flavor of this
     establishment since we are --

     TIGHT CLOSE-UP A FRAMED 8X10

     Thinly filmed in dust, mounted among dozens of other band shots.
     Visible among the posed members of a group called Diabolique is
     Eric, wielding guitar on the club stage.  ND BLUR as people 
     CROSS FRAME.

     GRANGE, 45-50, powerful, a seasoned assassin, cruel but loyal.
     His facade remains stony as he leads three other men briskly
     down the corridor.:  NGO NWA, 50ish, clad Chinese gangster style
     - white topcoat, white scarf, tinted shades - and two body guards
     supplying a power perimeter around him,lean, dark-haired Asian
     killers who would gladly die for Ngo Nwa, which they will in 
     just a minute.

     They have just passed the Diabolique 8X10.  Ngo Nwa's gloved
     fingers, in passing, leave little skid tracks in the dust that
     clear the eyes of Eric in the photo.

     As the foursome reaches the DOOR, Grange turns doubtfully -- 
     suspiciously -- to Nwa.

                    NGO NWA
          He will see me... unannounced.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - THE DOOR

     As Grange keys in the enter code the door hisses open.  Without
     a word, Nwa passes inside and the door is pulled shut in
     Grange's face by the Bodyguards, who post themselves to either
     side.

     INT. LAO'S NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

     The door CLOSES and the BG NOISE is GONE.  Through a large window
     (mirrored on the club side) all sorts of activity is visible
     through automatic mini-blinds.  A fly-vision bank of 12 TV
     monitors is hot with surveillance.

     LAO, a painfully clean-cut, Armani-clad Asian, impeccable,
     almost dashing, but the dynamic here is crystal clear: Nwa is
     the King: Lao, the dark prince in this hierarchy.

     At the desk, Lao is startled from his contemplation of a tiny,
     perfect rat skeleton by Ngo Nwa's unheralded entry.  The desktop
     is bare except for and Arcane Vietnamese fighting knife, half a
     meter long with an ideogrammed blade, dramatically positioned
     beneath an Artemide lamp.  Lao rises and feigns servility.

     NB:  The following exchange will play FAST, and entirely in
     VIETNAMESE.

                    LAO
          (formal greeting)

                    NWA
          (dismissiveness, contempt, then
          chastizing anger as:)

     Nwa INDICATES the blade with some ridicule.

                    LAO
          (phony assuagement)

                    NWA
          (knows it's bullshit)

     Lao turns, staring out the blinds, fighting for control.  Deep
     breath.  He turns back to his "master."  Nwa gestures broadly at
     the oppulent office, indicating that Lao should be grateful, but 
     is somehow errant
      
                    NWA
          (respect is required)

                    LAO
          (begrudging agreement)

     Lao sees the blade.  An idea.  He lifts it reverently, bears it
     the Nwa hilt-first in both hands, as if bestowing a thing of
     immeasurable worth.

                    NGO NWA
          (why give me this?)

     Nonetheless, Nwa accepts the blade.  It gleams.  Hypnotic. Even
     Nwa has to admire it.  Turns it so the blade is pointed at his
     sternum.  His attitude indicates Lao is too far away to do
     anything untoward.

                    LAO
          (sinister punchline)

     Lao spins through the air and HEEL-KICKS the blade THROUGH Nwa's
     chest, pinning him to the door.  It's over so fast the gasp of
     astonishment never escapes Nwa.  Lao is much more than merely 
     treacherous, he is extremely capable.

                    LAO
               (in perfect English)
          When I spoke of an offering, I
          didn't mean an offering to you.

     INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

     Grange, standing out of arm's reach in the corridor, kills both
     Bodyguards with a double headshot as they turn in greeting as the
     door OPENS.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - CORRIDOR - LAO, GRANGE, AND CORPSES

     Lao exchanges a look with his right arm; Grange nods
     affirmatively.

                    GRANGE
          You gonna smoke his bones now, or
          however it is you do it?

     Lao smiles indulgently.  He wipes the blood from the blade on
     the jacket of his ex-lord.  Lao now bows to no one. 

     EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - ANOTHER ALLEY - NIGHT

     Eric, wearing the combat boots, climbs as the crow leads him.
     Up.  He jams his hand on a rusty wedge of metal.  Ouch.

     CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S PALM

     Blood flows from the gash.  He vises his fist shut.

     ANGLE - ERIC ON FIRE ESCAPE

     Eye-to-eye with the crow.  Opens his hand.

     CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S PALM

     The blood flows back into the wound, which closes itself, 
     leaving another scar.

     ANGLE - ERIC

     Vising the rail.  Speaks to the night.  Almost a mantra.

                    ERIC
          "My kitten walks on velvet feet,
          and makes no sound at all.  And in
          the doorway nightly sits to watch
          the darkness fall.  I think
          he loves the lady night..."
               (to crow)
          Am I alive?  Am I dead?  Something
          else?  Something in between?

     CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

     Inscrutable.  No answer here.

     RESUME ERIC

     Almost bemused.  Steadier.  A hint of friendliness.

                    ERIC
          Thanks for sharing that.

     ETC. GIDEON`S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

     As the T-Bird grumbles tp park curbside.  Menacing.

     INT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

     A junkyard of loot and dusty discards.  Junkie thievings and
     other people's stereos.  Behind a wire-meshed security counter
     GIDEON reads a racing form, chain-smoking throughout the scene.  He
     is pear-shaped, stubbled, unkempt.  Food on his shirt.  JINGLE
     of doorbells.  Gideon lowers his paper to reveal Skank and
     T-Bird on approach.

                    GIDEON
          Ahhh, jesus, the creatures of the 
          night, here they come.  Tweedledum
          and Tweedledummer.

     Skank riles

                    SKANK
          Hey, blow me, fat boy!

     Just as quick, Gideon cocks and levels a Magnum at Skank.

                    GIDEON
          Blow yourself, bigmouth.

                    T-BIRD
               (interposing)
          Whoa, hey, whoa.
               (hands up)
          Business.

     He lifts a small carton onto the counter.

                    GIDEON
          Whatcha got?

     NEW ANGLE - COUNTER

     Transaction time.  T-Bird passes items through the screen slot 
     and Gideon gives each one cursory, doubtful inspection.

                    T-BIRD
          Coupla more rings... 24k.

                    GIDEON
          18k.  Crap.

                    T-BIRD
          ...necklace... pearls...

                    GIDEON
          Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,

                    T-BIRD
          Leather purse...

     He hands though the bag rested from the woman.

                    GIDEON
          What's this -- a little, ah,
          bloodstain, right?
               (doesn't matter)
          Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm
          doin' you a --

                    T-BIRD
          Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a 
          favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.

                    SKANK
          You wouldn't want Top Dollar not 
          to smile.

     Mention of Top Dollar clams Gideon efficiently up.  He hands
     over the cash to T-Bird with a grimace.

     EXT. ROOFTOP - ON ERIC - NIGHT

     Eric stares upward at the crow as it drops like a bomber from
     the night sky, flying past him, skimming the roof, leading him
     on.  Eric exhales, shrugs, feeling mocked by the bird.

                    ERIC
          All right.

     And he takes off on a run.  Only to stumble and fall.  But the
     falls turns into a TUMBLING ROLL that lands Eric back on his feet
     still moving.  He looks back as if to ask: "Did I do that?" and
     runs out of the frame.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - PICKING UP ERIC ON THE RUN.

     as he squints towards the crow and does his best to keep up.
     TRACK WITH HIM to the edge of the roof, heavily misted in rain.

     He jumps a negligible gap to the next lower roof.  The next 
     roof-top is a one-story jump down.  Eric clears the jump with a
     WOOF of air.  Keeping his eyes on the flying crow; gaining
     strength.  His next leap is more like a broad-jump.  Athletic.

     FAST MOVING ANGLE - THE CROW

     keeping airborne, keeping ahead.

     MOVING ANGLE - ERIC

     Eyes confidently on the sky as he arches out into space...

     UP ANGLE FROM STREET - BUILDINGS

     As Eric is seen to jump across the gap at least three stories up
     where there is no connecting building.

     CLOSE ANGLE - TARGET BUILDING LEDGE

     as Eric smashes into it, just missing, hinging at the waist,
     grabbing for purchase, suddenly panicked, gravity pulling him 
     downward.

     ANGLE - AT ERIC FROM PHONE CABLE BRACKET

     Eric falls but manages to grab the bracket one-handed.  He hangs
     for another deadly moment, then slowly, to his own astonishment,
     executes a one-handed pull-up that will save his ass.
                    ERIC
          Gotcha.

     He completes the pull-up, bringing his chin level with the 
     ledge.  As he reaches for it with his other hand the bracket
     rips from the wall and Eric plummets, with a howl of defeat.

     UP ANGLE FROM STREET - ERIC'S DOWNFALL

     It's a looooooong way down.

     ANGLE - ALLEYWAY

     as Eric lands and splits a trash can in two.  A beat as we wonder
     if any bones are left unpulped.  PUSH IN as Eric rolls from
     facedown to his back.

     TIGHT SHOT - ERIC'S FACE

     as he completes the roll, gasping, amazed he's still in one 
     piece.

     ANGLE - TRASHCAN - ON THE CROW

     It flies easily down to inspect Eric as he slowly sits up,
     examining his hands.  Frustrated and pissed off.

                    ERIC
          Thanks.

     CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

     Not "your welcome", but other-worldly patience.  It waits.

     RESUME ERIC

                    ERIC (CONT'D)
          Where're we going next -- the
          sewer?

     EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

     Still, dark silence until Eric lands from ABOVE FRAME, feline.
     The crow lands simultaneously b.g., perched near a roof access
     door with a shaded, dim-yellow bulb.

     CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

     It just blinks at him. 

     INT. ABANDONED STAIRWELL - NIGHT

     as Eric yanks open the rusty rooftop door from the outside and
     sweeps down the steps in a swirl of night mist

     ANGLE - FOOT OF STAIRS

     Trash and detritus all around, clogging the arteries of the
     building, which is old, unoccupied, forsaken.  The crow lights
     on a scarred banister knob.  Eric's footsteps come down into frame.

     ANGLE ON LOFT DOOR - INCLUDE ERIC

     A year ago this door was sealed with police barricade tape...
     which now sags, faded.

     A sticker across the jam notifies potential trespassers that
     this is -- was -- a crime scene.  Eric slows, stops, his hand
     on the banister.

     ANGLE - THE CROW

     as is wafts ahead of Eric, arriving at the door first.

     ANGLE ON ERIC, THE DOOR, THE CROW

     Eric has had enough.

                    ERIC
          Are we finished yet?

     CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND ON BANISTER
     sliding along, as he speaks, until it hits a cigarette burn.

     PUSH IN ON ERIC - TIGHT

     stiffening as he suffers his second --

     FLASH:  IMAGES and DIALOG are not linked.  A rapidfire MONTAGE set
     in the loft, a year earlier (it is decorated for Halloween).
     The broken door.  The stairwell is filled with cops and cop 
     noise; lab guys bustle.  Albrecht is there, making notes as a
     DETECTIVE steps over to him.

                    ALBRECHT
          Victim's name is Shelly Webster.
          The guy who got tossed is, uh ...--
               (checks his notebook)

     Albrecht grinds out his smoke on the banister.

                                   FLASH ENDS.

     RESUME ERIC ON THE STAIRS.

     He sits down hard, hurting from the flash.  His eyes seek the 
     crow.  He completes Albrecht's line:

                    ERIC
          "Draven, Eric."

     EXT. THE PIT - NIGHT

     LOW DOLLY of Elly's little combat boots moving toward the
     entryway of the pit.  MUSIC gradually UP LOUDER O.s. as she
     nears.

     ANGLE - ELLY IN DOORWAY

     Luridly-lit.  A grown-up's place.  A burly BOUNCER appraises
     her, his tone jokey.  He knows Elly.

                    BOUNCER
          Hey!  You got any ID?

                    ELLY
          Very funny.  Ha.  Ha.  Oh my,
          sides.

     The Bouncer jerks a thumb.  Go on in. 

     INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

     A grungy sawdust-floored shot-and-beer joint packed tight
     with urban BURNOUTS rushing to drink their lives away.  Hammering
     MUSIC and rude whorehouse lighting.  Each predator straining to
     be badder than the next.

     TRACK THROUGH this maze at Elly's eye level until we reach 
     DARLA, waitressing her heart out, the drug mileage on her 
     obvious.

                    ELLY
          Mom --?

                    DARLA
          I told you you're not supposed
          to come in here.

                    ELLY
               (a quick lie)
          I lost my key.

     Disgustedly -- goddamn kids -- Darla fishes up a key and slaps
     it into Elly's hand.

                    FUNBOY (O.S.)
          Hey, Darla -- before we die of old
          age, how about it --?

                    DARLA
               (to Elly)
          Out.  Now.  I gotta work.

     RACK PAST Darla and MOVE IN CLOSE on a corner table -- where sit
     Funboy, Skank, T-Bird and a black, vested muscle gypsy, TIN-TIN. 

     INT. LOFT - NIGHT

     As Eric shoves the door open from the outside.  The lock, popped
     from the frame, spins on the wooden floor.  The barrier tape
     whisps and dust roils.  Dark, chilly, damp.  A rat's nest of
     disuse.

     PULL BACK THROUGH THE BROKEN PICTURE WINDOW

     as Eric enters.  Glass blown out.  Shards poking.  Jagged.

     NEW ANGLE - AS ERIC WALKS IN

     He scans the loft.  Sees reflecting golden eyes near the floor.

     ERIC'S POV - FLOOR NEAR WINDOW

     A white, long-haired cat walks into a pool of night light.

     ANGLE - ERIC AND THE CAT

     He kneels.  Extends his hand.  The cat nears; likes Eric.

     CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND.

     as the cat makes contact.  Sudden white jolt - a FLASH.

     FLASH:  we HEAR Eric strumming his Strat o.s.  We see what he
     saw:  Shelly, holding the cat.

                                   FLASH ENDS.

     UP ANGLE - ERIC

     Wincing.  Recovering from the flash.  He purposefully gathers
     the cat into his arms and braces for more, harder, stronger...

     FLASH:  A MAN and a WOMAN make love on a big bed amidst a hundred
     points of candlelight.  Shelly and Eric, once upon a time.

                                   FLASH ENDS.

     REVERSE ANGLE FROM BEDROOM DOOR - ON ERIC

     as the cat, dropped, hits the floor and scrambles out of the way.

     CLOSE-UP - ERIC

     vising his head, teary-eyed, his nose bleeding.

                    ERIC
          No!  Don't look!  No! No!

     He whirls unexpectedly and punches his fist completely through
     the masonry wall.
     FLASH:  Eric and Shelly in a mock waltz.  He spins her and they
     collapse on the bed.

                                   FLASH ENDS.

     ANGLE - ERIC

     slowly pulling his arm out of the wall.

                    ERIC
               (whispering)
          Stop it.

     His eyes roll up and he slumps the length of the door frame like
     a drowning man.

     ANGLE - GABRIEL

     watching Eric.  He hits with an o.s. THUD.

     INT. THE PIT - ON FUNBOY'S TABLE - NIGHT

     As a gloved hand sets up four bullets next to four shots.

                    FUNBOY (O.S.)
          Let's have some fun.

     Funboy pops the bullet, like a contact capsule and washes it down.
     T-Bird turns to Tin-Tin, the new guy.

                    T-BIRD     You first.

                    TIN-TIN
          You're outta your fuckin' mind.

     Into it, almost jazzed, Tin-Tin downs his bullet and shot, and
     T-Bird does likewise.  Points to Skank.

                    T-BIRD
          No.  I'm not the lunatic.  He is.

     Skank riles, pulls a huge Auto Mag and sticks it in T-Bird's
     face, cocking.

                    SKANK
          Fuck you, T-Bird.

     Just as lightning fast, T-Bird has his own gun out and jammed
     right under Skank's jawbone.  He makes a kissy face.

                    T-BIRD
          I love you too, you madman.

     They all crack up laughing like ax murderers.  Skank drinks,
     Tin-Tin spot checks the satchell from Top Dollar's.  Darla
     delivers more shots and funboy feels her ass.

                    FUNBOY
          Hey, pussycat.

     INT. LOFT - DOWN ANGLE (CROW POV) - ERIC ON FLOOR

     He's awake.  Pushes himself up.

     REVERSE ANGLE - THE CROW

     Is perched in a dead light fixture, monitoring Eric.

     ANGLE - ERIC ON FLOOR

     He's awake.  Pushes himself up.  Realizes he is in the center of a 
     faint chalk outline on the hardwood floor.  He reaches to touch
     the dark stain of old blood.

     FLASH:  Shelly spills into frame, mouth bloodied.  T-Bird
     instantly on top of her, rough.

                                   FLASH ENDS.

     ANGLE - WITH ERIC

     as he abandons the outline and staggers to the window... where
     he cuts open his hand on jags of glass.

     FLASH:  Eric held firm in the grasp of T-Bird and Funboy, one
     arm each.  Five bloody bullet holes in Eric's chest.

     The thugs 1-2-3 and hurl Eric backwards through the window,
     which shatters.

                                   FLASH ENDS.

     ANGLE - ERIC AT THE WINDOW

     Reeling backward, same trajectory as in the Flash, but toward
     the floor, in SLO-MO.  Overloaded.  Blacking out.

     AS ERIC FALLS - INTERCUT MONTAGE

     A jumble of good/bad images from the loft:  Tin-Tin embedding a
     page of paper in the loft wall with a throwing knife...
     Shelly's face as she lights a candle... a POPPING champagne
     cork... the echoing CANNONADE of the shots that killed Eric...
     Skank backhanding Shelly... Shelly blowing bubbles from a
     clawfoot tub full of suds... Eric catching Funboy's first slug 
     high in the chest... NEW ANGLE of the glass in the window
     blowing out as T-Bird and Funboy through Eric through...

     ANGLE - ERIC'S REAL TIME FALL

     He plummets to BLACK OUT FRAME.  THUMP.  Out cold.

     INT. PIT - RESUMING FUNBOY'S TABLE - NIGHT

     Funboy contemplates his drink as the previous scene reverbs.

                    FUNBOY
          More fun than a torture chamber.

     Tin-Tin's pocket pager goes BEEP and startles them all.  Skank
     nearly shoots it, jumpy.  Tin-Tin pulls back on a black leather 
     trenchcoat after clicking off the pager.

                    TIN-TIN
          I hate this goddamn thing...

     ANGLE - DARLA watching them from a distance as Tin exits.

     INT. LOFT - FLOOR LEVEL - NIGHT

     An enormous cockroach trundles past, large in FRAME.  RACK to
     show Eric lying on floor b.g. as his eyes pop open.  A flurry of
     dark motion as the crow flies past frame.

     ANGLE -- THE CROW -- Having snatched the bug in it's beak.  Eats
     it.

     ANGLE - ERIC

     rising from the floor.  Careful.  Stealthy.  Watches his fireplace.

                    ERIC
          We have company.

     ANGLE ON FIREPLACE

     Huge.  Marble.  COld.  Eric's paper mache masks of Comedy and
     Tragedy still hang there.  The Skull Cowboy steps out of the
     dark and into the vague blue light.  Shadowy as ever.

                    SKULL COWBOY
          Having fun yet?  No?
               (beat)
          I'll give you a hint.  Remember
          whatshername?

                    ERIC
          Shelly?

                    SKULL COWBOY
          Miss her?

                    ERIC
          Yes.

                    SKULL COWBOY
          Kill the men who killed you both,
          and the Day of the Dead will be
          your reunion.

     The Skull Cowboy prestidigitates a flat throwing knife(like Tin-
     Tin's).  Eric's gaze follow it closely.

                    SKULL COWBOY (CONT'D)
          You must use your eyes.

     He points to the crow.

     ANGLE - THE COMING KNIFE - ("CROWVISION")

     Weirdly distorted, a shared vision between Eric and the crow.

     TIGHT ON ERIC

     As he DUCKS out of the path of the knife he sees through the
     bird's eyes.  He rolls.

     ON THE CROW

     It hops out of the way as the knife embeds in the wall.  Eric's
     ROLL finishes him up nearby.

                    ERIC
          Goddammit.

     He grabs for the knife as if to use it on the Skull Cowboy, but
     the knife causes an unexpected painful FLASH.

     FLASH:  Eric bouncing off the bedroom doorframe, Tin-Tin's knife
     stuck in his shoulder.

                                   FLASH ENDS.

     RESUME ERIC

     vising his head with his hands, in pain.  Too much pain.

                    SKULL COWBOY
          Get it?

                    ERIC
          Leave me alone -- !

     He looks up, the Skull Cowboy is still there.

                    SKULL COWBOY
               (contempt)
          Do something about it.
     ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND THE SKULL COWBOY.

     A horrible beat between them.  The Eric runs full tilt across
     the room, bounding to the open window and then leaping.

     ANGLE - SKULL COWBOY

     as close to surprise as he gets.  Steps out to watch as --

     ANGLE ON WINDOW - ERIC

     FLIES feet first out into space.

     CLOSE-UP - BRICKWORK ABOVE WINDOWFRAME

     Eric's fingers smash into grip the tiny mortared gaps!

     EXT. LOFT BUILDING - UP ANGLE FROM STREET - NIGHT

     High above, Eric's feet shoot out the window, knocking loose
     stray shards that fall toward frame.  He swings into an upside-
     down pose, impossibly holding himself rigid against the
     building's side, face down. by his quarter-inch finger grip.

     CLOSE-UP - ERIC

     Every muscle rigid, quivering with tension.  Hold.  Then he
     relaxes, and swings back inside.

     INT. LOFT - AT WINDOW, PICKING UP ERIC - NIGHT

     He arches, flips, to land on his feet.  The Skull Cowboy is
     gone.  No knife either.  The crow watches.  O.S. "meow".

     ANGLE - WITH ERIC AS HE TURNS TO SEE THE CAT

                    ERIC
          I guess I'm not ready to leave...
          just yet.

     He picks up the cat -- wary of flashes, which don't come this
     time -- and returns to the window.  Feeling safer.

                    ERIC (CONT'D)
          The last time we saw each other,
          I didn't do so well.
               (holds cat up)
          Huh, Gabriel?

     He moves to the fireplace.  With his free hand, lifts the
     Tragedy mask off its hook.  Puzzles it, fact-to-mask.

                    ERIC (CONT'D)
          I bet you need some cat food...
          right?

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT -ESTABLISHING:

     Eric walking, the Tragedy mask hanging from his hip.  An
     occasional PEDESTRIAN passes without comment, brutalized
     by the city.  Eric, more confident, smells the night's bouquet.

     EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT ("CROWVISION")

     Two men around a trashcan fire.  We should recognize Tin-Tin by 
     his black leather trench coat.  A wonderfully rude Rap tune, "Got
     a White WOman Tied Up In My Closet, Gonna Jab Her With A Stick,"
     RAZZLES b.g.

     EXT. STREET - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT

     As Eric reacts to what the crow has just seen.  Slows.  Stops.
     And directs his attention toward the mouth of the alley.

     EXT. ALLEY - TIGHT ON TIN-TIN - NIGHT

     He pulls the nickel plated revolver from the satchel.  FOLLOW as
     he hands it across to RATSO, who removes the suitcase-sized boom 
     box (the source of the music) from his shoulder to accept.
     Ratso is a feral skull-head; street trash.

                    TIN-TIN
          Three hundred and your a 
          gunslinger.

     HIGH ANGLE - TIN-TIN and RATSO

     As the crow is still watching, yet perched.  A brief
     shove-and-standoff.  The gun deal has gone bad.

                    RATSO
          Please, TIn-Tin, you know I'm good
          for the money, man, I promise,
          Leslie put me up to it, please,
          man, don't --
               (choking scream)

     Tin-Tin has just up-rammed a throwing knife into Ratso.

                    TIN-TIN
          Ratty -- shut the fuck up.

     Tin-Tin lifts Ratso on the knife, gutting him.  Ratso goes
     slack, deader'n hell.  Tin-Tin reaches around to click OFF 
     the boom box... then let's Ratso`s corpse fall.

                    ERIC (O.S.)
          Another satisfied customer?

     TIGHT ANGLE - TIN-TIN

     galvanized by the surprise voice.  He automatically draw a
     fresh knife from the bandolero of knives across his chest inside
     the coat.  Can't yet track the source of the voice.

                    TIN-TIN
          Who the hell is that?
               (beat, venomous)
          Come on out man, I won't hurt
          you.

     ANGLE - ERIC IN ALLEY

     He steps out from behind another flaming trashcan.  Wearing a 
     long black scarf and the Tragedy mask.

                    ERIC
          Hello, Tin-Tin.

     ANGLE ON TIN-TIN - AS HE RISES (FROM RATSO)

     trying to process what he sees.  And cover.  And buy time.

                    TIN-TIN
          Little early from trick-or-treat,
          homie.
               (re: Ratso)
          This dick trying to bushwack me.

                    ERIC
          Murderer.

     Tin-Tin blows out a breath.  No bluff.  Time to kill again.

                    TIN-TIN
          Guess you got that goddamn right.

     He shrugs.  The shrug becomes the launch of a knife.

     TIGHT SHOT - MOVING - ERIC

     His black-gloved hand slaps away the incoming knife and inch from
     his nose.  It CLATTERS.  Eric continues striding toward Tin-TIn.

                    ERIC
          Try harder.  Try again.

     SHIFTING ANGLE - ERIC NEARS TIN-TIN

     as Tin-TIn throws another knife.  Eric closing in.  He claps
     hand together, immobilizing the next knife.  Opens his hands,
     almost an "oops" gesture.  Keeps on coming.

     ANGLE - ERIC AND TIN-TIN

     As they meet.  Tin-Tin attempts a roundhouse.  Eric blocks it
     and smashes Tin-Tin into the alley wall.

                    ERIC
          A year ago.  Halloween.  A man
          and a woman.  In a loft.  You
          helped to murder them.

                    TIN-TIN
          Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...
               (beat)
          Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her
          too, I think.

                    ERIC
          You cut her.  You raped her.
               (rage)
          You watched!

                    TIN-TIN
          Hey, I got my rocks off, so
          fuck you in the ass, man.
          
     They're face-to-face now, sweaty and tense.  Eric peels off
     the Tragedy mask.

                    ERIC
          I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.

                    TIN-TIN
          I don't know you...

     But, as Eric bears down on Tin-TIn, Tin begins to recognize him.
     Fear.  Sweat.

     For the first time, Tin-Tin starts to loose control.

                    TIN-TIN (CONT'D)
          Holy shit... you're dead, man...

     EXTREME CLOSE-UP - ERIC

                    ERIC
          Victims.  Aren't we all.

     INT. LOFT - NIGHT

     TIGHT ANGLE - TABLETOP

     as Eric's hands place Ratso's boom box on the table and click on 
     suitable weird b.g. MUSIC.

     ANGLE - FLOOR LEVEL

     Eric's boots pass frame.  An open can of cat food CLANKS down
     big in f.g.  as Eric walks b.g. obviously wearing Tin-Tin's 
     trenchcoat.  Gabriel noses into to frame to eat from the can.

     INT. LOFT, BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER)

     Shelly's vanity.  Dusty, disused.  The mirror spiderwebbed with
     cracks but still hanging precariously in its frame.  Eric is 
     seated, his image crazily split into many.  He pulls on a long-
     sleeved, tight-knit, black shirt.

     WIDEN ANGLE to reveal the loft now lit with dozens of candle
     stubs.  Placed all around.  Ceremonial and weird.

     CLOSE-UP - ERIC

                    ERIC
          Halloween is coming.  The Day of the Dead...

     In the mirror, multi Eric's.  He touches the glass, tightening up 
     as he realizes he's in for another --

     FLASH:  Shelly, sleeping on her divan, a year ago, wakes as Eric
     (O.S.) says "Boo".  She cracks an eye open.

                    SHELLY
          Your scary quotient needs work.

                                   FLASH ENDS.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AT VANITY

     Considering old cosmetics.  Everything he touches will hurt him.
     But he's ready to eat this pain.  He grabs a lipstick.

     FLASH:  Shelly at the vanity in happier times

                    SHELLY
          I think red's my color, don't you?

                                   FLASH ENDS.

     RESUME ERIC

     wincing.  He drops the lipstick on the floor.  Grabs a
     hairbrush.

     FLASH:  Eric smashes into the street after his death-fall,
     trailing broken glass.

                                   FLASH ENDS.

     NEW ANGLE - ERIC AT VANITY

     Later.  He's wearing white pancake makeup on his cheeks.  Shaky.

     FLASH:  Eric sucks up Funboy's gunshots in the chest.  1-2-3-4.

                                   FLASH ENDS.

     RESUMING ERIC AT VANITY

     his face a crazy warpaint maze of white streaks, not blended
     yet.  He looks at his own reflection.  In one cracked,
     triangular facet of the mirror is not a multiple of his face,
     but the Skull Cowboy.  Just one.

                    SKULL COWBOY
          Glad to see you're finally with
          the program.

                    ERIC
          Bugger off to the graveyard, skull-
          face, I'm busy.

                    SKULL COWBOY
          You work for the dead.  Forget
          that, and you can forget it all.

     The Cowboy tips his hat and isn't there.  Eric sees the crow
     perched on the edge of the mirror now.

                    ERIC
          Forget this.

     He smears the streaks until his face is uniformly grave-wave
     white.

     ANGLE - GABRIEL THE CAT

     coming in to sniff around the clutter at the foot of the vanity.
     Eric looks down towards him... and toward the lipstick he dropped.

     CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND

     as it glides down to pick up the lipstick.  CONTACT, and --

     FLASH:  Eric, smashed on the street, T-Bird's car b.g., upside down
     in Eric's POV as he rolls over and blood courses from both
     corners of his mouth,  a definite foreshadow of the "Crow" face.

                                   FLASH ENDS.
     RESUMING ERIC AT VANITY - TIGHT

                    ERIC
          She always red red was her color.

     EXTREME CLOSE - THE MIRROR

     We see only a reflected corner of Eric's mouth as he duplicates
     the blood trail in red lipstick, making one one half of a crow
     harlequin smile.

     EXT. LOFT BUILDING - LATER - NIGHT

     A MEDIUM SHOT as lightning strikes; a storm brews.

     EXT. LOFT - LATER - NIGHT

     CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S BOOTS

     crossing the floor.  Tin-Tin's knife slotted to the bucklework.

     CLOSE-UP - VANITY

     Eric's hands discard a hairbrush there.  He moves off.

     CLOSE-UP - GABRIEL

     looking up o.s., watching his master stalk around with purpose.
     Thunder rumbles long o.s.

     ANGLE - AT ERIC IN WINDOW FROM OUTSIDE

     The storm boils.  Eric framed in broken window.

     CLOSER ANGLE - ERIC IN WINDOW

     Eric all in black,  Firm-wrapped.  Tight-wired.  The trenchcoat
     flutters, cloak-like.  His shadowy face framed by the upturned
     collar, his hair punkish and spiky.

     SIDE ANGLE - ERIC

     as he moves forward in the light.  The crow lights on his shoulder.

                    ERIC
          All right, bad guys...

     FRONT VIEW - ERIC

     Full crow regalia.  Face makeup streamlined.  Eric's eyes flash.

                    ERIC
               (in drawn out yell)
          Here I commme -- !

     PULL BACK swiftly, vertiginously, as Eric swan dives from the
     window, his voice a howl.

     UP ANGLE FROM STREET - ERIC'S FALL

     Coat, wing-like.  MATCH his dive yell with o.s. crow SCREECH.
     SLOW MOTION as Eric fills the frame and we --

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. ALLEY - WHERE TIN-TIN GOT IT - NIGHT

     Cop lights bounce, competing with the trash fires.  Albrecht and
     several other UNIFORMS assess the double-death scene.  A
     detective, TORRES tries to appear in charge.

                    TORRES
          Couldn't have happened to a nicer 
          couple.

     ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND TORRES OVER DEAD TIN-TIN

     Tin-Tin frozen in deathshock, all of his knives sticking out of 
     him.  Dead Ratso, b.g., where he fell.

                    ALBRECHT
          Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not
          here, neither is T-Bird -- none
          of Top Dollar's number ones.

                    TORRES
          You know, you sure got a hard-on for
          a guy that's guilty of zip on
          paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime;
          what's the matter, don't you like
          adult entertainment?

                    ALBRECHT
          This sack of shit is called Tin-
          Tin.

                    TORRES
          Don't any of your little pals have
          real, grown up names?

                    ALBRECHT
          He was a runner for Top Dollar.
          Just muscle.

                    TORRES
          Was.
                    ALBRECHT
               (sigh)
          This isn't Top Dollar's style
          anyway.  This was somebody else.
          Somebody new.

     Albrecht lights a fresh smoke.  Torres waves the smoke away.

                    TORRES
          And you're gonna tell me who.

                    ALBRECHT
          Who ever made that.

     Albrecht points.  CAMERA FOLLOWS to wall behind Tin-Tin.  A crow
     silhouette has been daubed in blood there, now dry.

                    TORRES
          What in the hell... do you
          call that?

                    ALBRECHT
          I call it blood, Detective.  If
          you want, you can call it graffiti.

     INT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

     CLOSE-UP of Gideon's thick fingers shuffling grimy currency.
     Some scratchy 1920's TUNE plays throughout b.g., like a broadcast
     from another time and place.

     TIGHTER ANGLE - GIDEON

     looking up at a metallic SOUND, o.s.  Irritated.

                    GIDEON
          Piss off, we're closed.

     As the outside security gate rattles, Gideon draws his magnum
     and approaches the front door.

                    GIDEON
          Fucking creatures of the night;
          they never goddamn learn.

     Sudden surprise as he sees the silhouette of the gate SCREE back
     against the frosted glass of the front door.

                    GIDEON (CONT'D)
          HEY!!

     And he hustles to close up the distance between himself and the
     door, gun up.  Before he can touch the door, the crowbar comes
     rocketing through the glass, pegging Gideon in the forehead and 
     knocking him flat on his ass.  He loses the pistol.
     Eric walks through the door, causing the fractured glass to
     disintegrate around him.  He disclaims, thespian.

                    ERIC
          "Suddenly I heard a tapping, as of
          someone gently rapping, rapping at
          my chamber door."
               (pause)
          You heard me rapping, right?

     LOW ANGLE - GIDEON ON THE FLOOR

     reacting to Eric's weird appearance and looking for his gun.

                    GIDEON
          Oh, bullshit!  You're trespassing
          asshole, you're breakin'
          and enterin' and you just bought me a
          fucking door!

     During Gideon's rant, Eric brushes glass cubes from his
     shoulders, nonplussed.  Now he flings Gideon across the room.

     Gideon crashes into the counter cage.  As Eric advances on him:

                    ERIC
          I'm looking for something in an
          engagement ring.  Gold.

     As Eric comes up behind him, Gideon reaches through the open
     cage door and pulls a big combat knife from beneath the counter.

                    GIDEON
          You're looking for a coroner,shit-
          for-brains!

     And he tries to nail Eric with the knife.

     NEW ANGLE - BEHIND GIDEON - AS GIDEON SWINGS

     No Eric behind him.  TILT to reveal Eric hanging off the cage
     above Gideon.  Eric slams the cage door against Gideon's head.
     Drops down like a spider and collects the knife.

                    ERIC
          I repeat: a gold engagement ring.
          It was pawned here, a year ago, by
          another gentleman whose name, I
          believe was... "T-Bird"?

     IN TIGHT ON ERIC AND GIDEON

     Eric twists Gideon's sail-like shirt and Gideon turns bright red.

                    ERIC (CONT'D)
          Cute nickname, don't you think?

                    GIDEON
               (gasping)
          I ain't got no fuckin' ring.

                    ERIC
          Wrong answer.

     Eric nails Gideon's hand to the counter top.  Gideon howls!

                    GIDEON
          All's I got is in a box!  Behind
          the counter!

     Eric jumps through the cage door.  Gideon's eyes bug as he sees 
     his own pierced hand, immobilized.

     ANGLE - ON ERIC BEHIND THE COUNTER

     scans the shelves.  Rows of boxed ammo.  Kerosene tins.  A shotgun.  
     Knives and assorted knuckle duster curios.  And the ring box.

     CLOSE-UP - THE RING BOX IN ERIC'S HAND.

     Dozens of gold rings.  Eric's fingers sift through them.

     TIGHTER ON ERIC

     He brings each ring to his face.  INTERCUT with Gideon's feeble
     struggles and invective, o.s.

                    ERIC
          No... no... no... no...

     He tosses each rejected ring over his shoulder.  Until:

     CLOSE-UP - THE RING IN ERIC'S HAND

     Obliterated by a stab of brilliant white light --

     FLASH:  Shelly's face.  A perfect vision...

                                   FLASH ENDS.

     RESUMING ERIC

     He closes his fist tightly around the ring.  A moment of
     decision.  Then he draws the shotgun from beneath the counter.
     Uses the butt to knock the knife free of Gideon's hand.  It goes
     spinning across the countertop.  Eric shucks the shotgun and
     rams it into Gideon's nose as the big man slumps to the floor.

                    ERIC
          Tin-Tin confided in me, before he
          ran out of breath.  You have one
          chance to live.
                    GIDEON
          No fucking way.  He'll kill me.

                    ERIC
          Who would waste time killing you...
          besides me?

     Gideon sweats, pants, contemplates the hole in his hand.

                    GIDEON
               (cowed)
          Top Dollar.

                    ERIC
          Another jolly nickname?

                    GIDEON
          You want those assholes, you want 
          Top Dollar.

                    ERIC
          T-Bird?

                    GIDEON
          Like the car.  He hangs out with
          Skank. that little ass-hair, and
          they hang at the Pit -- hell,
          Funboy lives there.  Ask Top
          Dollar.

                    ERIC
          A whole club of pirates, with
          pirate names...

     Eric seems to go berserk, SMASHING and PUNCTURING cans of
     flammables and powder while Gideon flinches, nursing his holed
     hand.  Blows just miss Gideon's head.  Soon he's cowering.

     LOW ANGLE - ERIC

     Looking down at Gideon in revulsion.

                    ERIC
          You feed off the living.

     SMASH!  as another tin ceases to exist next to Gideon.  Then
     Eric is gone, past him without further word, ignoring him
     entirely.  As he exits, shotgun shouldered, he pauses to admire
     a white Fender Strat hanging among the pawnables.  He reaches 
     for it.

     ON GIDEON

     As he summons some last minute budget bravery.

                    GIDEON
          You walk outta here Top Dollar
          will erase your ass!  Top Dollar
          owns the fucking street here and
          you can't dick with me, you son of
          a bitch! 

     RESUME ERIC - FRAMED IN DOORWAY

     The guitar now bowslung across his back, the shotgun levelled at
     Gideon's position.

                    ERIC
          One chance to live.  Take it.

     MOVE IN TIGHT ON GIDEON

     as he realizes what Eric means.  Hauls ass and bangs through the
     rear door with a bleat of terror.

     ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC IN DOOR  

     as he cuts loose with the shotgun.

     EXT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

     as seen from across the street.  Eric silhouetted, unmoving as
     the whole store front blows hellaciously out around him, raining
     glass and debris.  Stirring his hair.  Eric is the black eye of
     the fireball.

     LOW ANGLE - FRONT OF PAWN SHOP - EMPHASIZE ERIC

     lit by flames and residual explosions.  He hurls the shotgun
     into the inferno.  Casually brushes flaming/smoking detritus
     from his own clothes.

                    ALBRECHT (O.S.)
          Don't move! I said don't move.

     NEW ANGLE - ERIC

     as he turns slowly, to see Albrecht, out of reach, gun drawn.
     Eric's attitude lightens; Albrecht is not the threat here.

                    ERIC
          I thought the police always said
          "freeze:.

     Albrecht divides his attention, jumpy, between the odd sight of
     Eric (guitar on his back), and the raging instant inferno of
     Gideon's.

                    ALBRECHT
          I'm the police and I say don't
          move, Snow White.  You're under
          arrest; I don't care what else is 
          wrong with you!  You move and
          you're dead.

     Eric has begun to pace towards Albrecht.  Palms up.  A gesture of
     submission.  Albrecht's battle calm begins to waiver.

                    ERIC
          And I say I'm dead... and I move.

                    ALBRECHT
          No further.  I'm serious.

     Eric bows, bringing his forehead in line with the gun's muzzle.

                    ERIC
          Then shoot, if you will.

     TIGHT ANGLE - ALBRECHT

     He gives it up.  Can't shoot.  This is too weird for him.

                    ALBRECHT
          Are you nuts, walking into a gun?

     NEW ANGLE - LESS THREATENING - ERIC AND ALBRECHT

                    ERIC
          You must listen carefully:  the 
          Fire Department will be here soon.
          There is an injured man in the 
          alley who needs assistance.
               (meaningfully)
          As Shelly Webster once needed your 
          assistance, and as you are shortly 
          going to need my assistance.

     Albrecht gestures casually, almost comically, with his pointed
     gun.  B.g., the crow lands on a fire escape to monitor them.

                    ALBRECHT
          You wanna run that back for me one
          time?

     SIRENS near, o.s.  Eric listens to them, to the night.

                    ERIC
          Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the
          street here."  He will "erase
          my ass."

                    ALBRECHT
          You don't say.

                    ERIC
          I know Top Dollar has turned your 
          streets into his hell.

                    ALBRECHT
          Fucking A, my friend.

                    ERIC
          The others are called Skank, T-
          Bird.  Street names.  Funboy.
               (beat)
          Watch me, office Albrecht.

     Eric lifts a chunk of glass from the sidewalk.  Slow and easy.
     Albrecht doesn't completely trust him.  Up comes the gun.

                    ALBRECHT
          Watch it...

     Eric slices open his palm.  Blood flows.  To his fingertips.

     NEW ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT

     as Eric quickly daubs a crow silhouette in blood on the wall...
     then exhibits the gashed hand to Albrecht.

     CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND

     as the blood retreats and the wound seals itself up.

     TIGHT ON ALBRECHT

     and the silhouette.  Mouth hangs.

                    ALBRECHT
          You're the one who did Tin-Tin...

     PULL BACK FAST to reveal Eric is gone from the frame.  Albrecht does
     a quick 180.  No Eric.  Flashbars from incoming units begin
     to bounce red and blue off his face.

                    ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
          Great.  Good night.  Guy shows up
          looking like a mime from hell.
               (beat)
          Least he didn't do that "walking
          against the wind" shit;  I hate
          that.

     EXT. SHOWTIME - NIGHT - TO ESTABLISH.

     A night-owl pornucopia.  T-Bird enters beneath a garish theater
     marquee.  The 2-bill:  RUMP ROMP with BUTTBUSTERS II.

     INT. SHOWTIME LOBBY - NIGHT

     T-Bird approaches the snack bar.  Wet, breathy mating NOISES
     from the auditorium throughout, o.s.  Looking supremely bored,
     the counterman, DICKEY BIRD, thumbs a porn tabloid.  So what.

                    DICKEY BIRD
          T-Bird.  Thrill me.

                    T-BIRD
          Business.

     T-bird heads left through s steal door that Dickie buzzes
     open for him.

     INT.  SHOWTIME AUDITORIUM (BACKSTAGE) - NIGHT

     T-Bird walks past dust-covered boxy black speakers as we glimpse
     Lance and Angelique making history in reverse, on the back of the 
     movie screen: oratoria as good as porn films can make it.

                    PORN QUEEN (O.S.)
          I don't know how to describe how
          I feel, Lance -- so restless --

                    PORN KING (O.S.)
          You're my Moon Queen, Angelique.

                    PORN QUEEN (o.S.)
          Oooh -- I want you're rocket right
          now in my Sea of Tranquility -- 
          Lance --

     ANGLE - CATWALK STAIRS

     As T-Bird approaches, the movie sounds dwindle o.s.  He ascends
     the skinny metal stairway two steps at a time.

     ANGLE - STEEL FACED DOOR AT TOP OF STAIRS.

     As T-Bird nears it, a viewplate SNAPS open to asses him.  By
     the time he reaches the top, the door unbolts to admit him.

     INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

     As T-Bird enters.  The room is organized around a long meeting
     table and flavored with a taste of everything illegal:  drug
     paraphernalia, weapons.

     Across the table are a couple of Sentries like the one that
     admits T-Bird to the room.  TRACK PAST them to a lank-haired
     silhouette as he turns away from a windowshade, backlit by
     Showtime's exterior neon.

     This is TOP DOLLAR.  Who looks like a Johnny Winter acid 
     casualty but is deadly cold, definitely the man in charge.

                    TOP DOLLAR
          Wild fucking night.  I hear our
          pal Tin-Tin got himself very dead.

                    T-BIRD
          And Gideon's just burned all the
          down to the foundation.

     Top's eyebrows go up.  Oh really?

                    T-BIRD (CONT'D) 
          I didn't have nothin to do with
          that.

                    TOP DOLLAR
          Bet that pisses you off, right?

                    T-BIRD
          Top, what the fuck is going on
          tonight?

                    TOP DOLLAR
          Stay normal, T.  Cops'll be all
          hotwired and aggressive.  No
          combat moves until I check this
          out.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT - (~CROWVISION") HIGH ANGLE

     Taking in the street, the Pit, and a little girl seated on an
     abandoned car.

     ANGLE - STREET LEVEL - ON ELLY.

     Seated on the looted wheelless car, playing with a small doll.

     CLOSER ANGLE - ON ELLY

     She doesn't notice someone is watching her yet.

     TIGHT ON DOLL, THEN ELLY

     She looks up o.s. at Eric, who is still out of the frame.

                    ELLY
          What are you supposed to be?  A clown?

     CLOSE-UP - ERIC

     He smiles for what seems to be the first time.  Warm, even past
     his crow makeup.

                    ERIC
          Sometimes.

     He glances back and logs the location of the Pit for later, not
     in a big hurry just now.  Turns back to Elly.

     WIDE ANGLE - ERIC AND ELLY

                    ELLY
          You look like a rock star without a
          job.

                    ERIC
          I dabble.  May I?

     He indicates the car hood, a "seat" next to Elly from which he
     may observe the Pit.

                    ELLY
          If you're not some kinda child 
          molester.

     Eric looks behind himself.  Who, me?  Genuinely amused.  He 
     shakes his head no and sits down next to Elly. 

     INT. CLUB TRASH - NIGHT

     The music POUNDS and smoke is everywhere, like incense.
     INTERCUTS of the clientele, retro, robotic, clove cigarettes and
     rubber clothing; fetish casual wear.

     ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR

     right in the center of the noise, looking downscale and dirty
     in this milieu.

     ANGLE - ANOTHER CUSTOMER

     Passing Top, appraising him, finding him as boring as life
     itself.  Undertaker chic, she stares at Top.

                    TOP DOLLAR
          I thought Halloween was tomorrow
          night.

     An Oriental bodyguard passes him in f.g., motioning to follow.

     INT. LAO'S NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

     Lao watches club activity on his flybank of TVs.  When Top
     Dollar shows up at the office door two Sentries try to bar his 
     passage.  He shoves through.

                    TOP DOLLAR
          Get outta my way, you mooks.

     Lao's demeanor indicates that they should not kill Top.

                    LAO
          An unexpected pleasure.

                    TOP DOLLAR
          Bad news.  Alot of action on the
          streets tonight, and nobody
          bothered to clear it with me.  Tin-
          Tin got himself whacked.

                    LAO
          Who got himself what?

                    TOP DOLLAR
          One of mine.  And it wasn't a 
          standard hit.

                    LAO
          I had heard something like this.
               (beat)
          Describe it for me.  The "hit".

                    TOP DOLLAR
          I was wondering if you could tell
          me anything... about a wildcat
          operative.

                    LAO
          I know of no one.
               (beat)
          But even if there is, I am sure it
          is nothing outside your capacity 
          to deal with?

                    TOP DOLLAR
          Anybody violates my turf -- our 
          turf -- I'll rip out there heart 
          and show it to 'em.

                    LAO
          To be sure.  Now tell how your 
          friend died.

     INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - NIGHT

     ANNABELLA, a comfortable large, spider-in-the-web deskworker,
     sits typing at a terminal.  Miked headphone in one ear, police
     scanner chatter o.s.  She blows and pops a pink bubble of gum.

                    ALBRECHT (O.S.)
          Annie?

     ANGLE - ANNABELLA AND ALBRECHT

     Albrecht enters frame from across her countertop.

                    ANNABELLA
          Whatever it is, the answer's no,
          Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.

                    ALBRECHT
          Annie, I need a file.

     There is a desperate edge to Albrecht's voice.

                    ANNABELLA
          Speak up.
               (beat; her guard up)
          Clear it with the Captain if you
          need a file.

                    ALBRECHT
          This is special, darlin'.  Please?

     Annabella eyes Albrecht doubtfully.  Fatalistic sigh.

                    ANNABELLA
          Just don't tell me you "owe me
          one."  What file?

                    ALBRECHT
          Double homicide.  A year ago.
          Las Halloween.

     EXT. STREET NEAR THE PIT - ERIC AND ELLY - NIGHT

     Still hanging by the car, a bit more familiar with each other
     now.  A low-slung mirror-windowed LIMOUSINE hisses past them and
     curbs across the street from the Pit.

                    ELLY
          My mom works over there.  I'm
          waiting for her, but she's
          probably with him, right now.

                    ERIC
          Who?
                    
                    ELLY
          Mister Funboy.

                    ERIC
          Mister Funboy lives there?

     TWO SHOT - ELLY AND ERIC - (PIT B.G.)

                    ELLY
          He has a room, upstairs.  I don't
          like him very much.

     Elly is not happy about this.  B.G. we see Grange get out of the 
     car, heading to the Pit, and notice in passing a guy with the
     white face talking to the little girl down on the block.

                    ELLY (CONT'D)
          Can you play that thing or do you
          just carry it around everywhere?

     Elly indicates the guitar strapped to Eric' back.

                    ERIC
          I can pick out a tune now 
          and again.

                    ELLY
          Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"
               (re: doll)
          It used to be her favorite.

                    ERIC
          Does she have a name?

                    ELLY
          No name.  You sure ask a lot of
          questions.

     Elly HANDS the doll to Eric and he experiences a wholly 
     unexpected flash.

     FLASH:  Elly and SHelly sitting as SHelly's vanity, goofing with
     makeup, test-driving lipstick, the doll visible on the vanity.

                                   FLASH ENDS.

     RESUME ERIC - AS THE DOLL DROPS FROM HIS HAND

     Pain is trying to fight it's way out of Eric in surges. 

                    ELLY (OS)
               (smart alec)
          Hel-lo?  Earth to anybody...?

     Eric snaps out of it.  Elly retrieves the doll.

                    ELLY (CONT'D)
          Do you feel okay.

                    ERIC
          No.

                    ELLY
          You gotta go now, I bet.

                    ERIC
          I have to go.

     Half-zomboid, half-determined, he exits.

     INT. PIT - NIGHT - WITH GRANGE

     As he circulates to the bar, unimpressed.  To the bouncer:

                    GRANGE
          Top Dollar?

                    BOUNCE
          Never heard of him.

                    GRANGE
          Funboy?

                    BOUNCER
          Oh, prob'ly upstairs bangin'
          Darla.  Pay for your own beer and
          they'll prob'ly be down before you 
          can drink it.

     INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT

     CLOSE-UP of an 8x10 of the loft slaughter in Albrecht's hands.
     Subject: a document pinned to the wall with a knife.

     ANGLE - ALBRECHT AT DESK.

     flipping through the file. Smoking.

     ANGLE - THE 8X10 IN ALBRECHT'S HAND

     Subject: Eric, dead in the street in front of the loft 
     building.  The blood on his face reminiscent of his crow face.

     As Albrecht's hand moves the photo we can see in the file
     several band shots of Eric as a member of Diabolique... 
     including the shot on Lao's wall gallery of past performers at
     Club Trash.

     A DOUGHUT on a paper plate suddenly touches down in the middle
     of all this research, startling Albrecht.

     ANGLE - ANNABELLA BEHIND HIM

                    ANNABELLA
          Don't thank me.  Your ass is
          already in enough trouble for this shit.

                    ALBRECHT
          I knew that.

     Albrecht holds a typewritten page closer to the the light.

     CLOSE-UP DOCUMENT, torn by the knife hole made by Tin-Tin.

     It reads:  We, the Undersigned tenants of 1929 Calderone Court
     Apartments...

                    ALBRECHT
          Another nice white girl with a
          cause.  Like a big KICK ME sign.

     Albrecht takes up and 8x10 of Eric's face.

                    ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
          Shelly Webster.  And her nice 
          white boyfriend, Eric Draven.

     With a felt-tip pen he superimposes the crow smile, like the make-
     up, like the blood.

                    ANNABELLA
          Your last little wild goose chase
          got you busted back to the Beat 
          Patrol, just like in a bad
          detective story, Eddie. Are we
          doing the wildgoose thing again?

     UNDER THIS Albrecht sketches in Eric's spiky Crow hairdo.

                    ALBRECHT
          Could be.

                    ANNABELLA
          You gonna wind up working at a school
          crosswalk.   that doughnut's 
          chocolate you, know.

     PUSH IN on the doctored photo.  It's Eric.  It's the Crow.

     PUSH IN on ALbrecht.

                    ALBRECHT
          Well, hello there...chocolate,

                    ANNABELLA
          Don't thank me.

                    ALBRECHT
          Thanks, babe.

     INT. THE PIT (REAR) - ERIC ON FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

     Climbing.  The crow perched on his shoulder.  Not in a hurry.

                    ERIC
          It's a Raymond Chandler evening
          And the pavements are all wet, And
          I'm lurking in the shadows, for it 
          hasn't happened ...

     TIGHT CLOSE-UP - ERIC

     Impish.  Clown killer.

                    ERIC (CONT'D)
          ... yet.

     INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

     Grange at a table.  SMoking and waiting.  No beer.  His back
     protected, he is stationed near the fire stair door and has a
     good overview of the room.

     INT. FUNBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

     CLOSE-UP of a base pipe being lit and hit hard.

     EXT. THE PIT (REAR) - FIRE ESCAPE - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT

     Eric's gloved hand slides sinuously up rusted railing.

     INT. FUNBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

     A hypodermic needle rises into frame.  A nicotined fingernail
     flicks bubbles in the syringe.  FOLLOW needle down and BROADEN
     ANGLE: Funboy taps up a vein in Darla's arm and shoots her up.
     Both are naked in a shabby bed.  Bare lightbulb above.

                    DARLA
          Ooh, baby -- gimme all of it.

     CLOSE-UP - THE NEEDLE

     As the plunger depresses.

     ANGLE - ON THE WINDOW

     As the crow quite unexpectedly arrives and perches on the sill,
     scaring the shit out of our two dopey friends.  Funboy pulls a
     giant auto pistol; mock aims, calms down, doesn't fire.

                    DARLA
          It's a big fucking bird...

     She falls back against her pillow, eyes dreamily defocusing.
     Funboy giggles.  Relaxes the gun, which half-disappears into the 
     sheets at his side.

                    FUNBOY
          It's a squab.  Here bird, Here,
          birdie...

     NEW ANGLE - DARLA AND FUNBOY

     Except that Eric now stands near their bed, across from the 
     bird's position, the guitar bowslung.

                    ERIC
          Here Funboy.

     Contained panic as Funboy and Darla both startle.  The needle 
     flies and lands at Eric's feet.  Empty.  Funboy struggles to
     maintain against his high.

                    FUNBOY
          Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do
          that, man.  I nearly had a fucking
          heart attack.

                    DARLA
          Fun -- look at that guy...

                    FUNBOY
          It's just the dope, don't worry

                    DARLA
          Fun, he's not going away; he's 
          scaring the piss outta me!

                    FUNBOY
          Not me.

     Funboy draws the gun from underneath the sheers.  Suddenly he seems
     totally focused.

                    FUNBOY (CONT'D)
          Time for you to take your bird and 
          leave, freako.

     Eric rips open his shirtfront to reveal a circlet of bullet
     punctures.  This gives Funboy pause.
                    ERIC
          Take your shot funboy.  You got 
          me, dead bang.

     Funboy tilts the gun off target.  Grins as Eric flat handedly
     past his chest, indicating where to shoot.

                    FUNBOY
          You are seriously fucked up, man.
          Just look at yourself.

     In a blur, he sighs, and shoots Eric through the heart.

                    FUNBOY (CONT'D)
          BANG!  He shoots, he scores!

     Then his expression drags a little bit.

     ANGLE - ERIC

     Looking down and daubing his hand in the bullet wound on his chest.

                    ERIC
          Bull's eye.  Good shot.

     ANGLE - DARLA

     who starts scrambling to get out.  Grabbing clothes on the floor
     around herself. she runs right into Eric's outstretched hands.

                    ERIC
          Stay.

     Eric twists her arm.

     CLOSE-UP - DARLA'S FOREARM.

     where we may clearly see the needle tracks.  

     UP ANGLE - ERIC 

                    ERIC
          Morphine is bad for you.

     He holds her arm captive.  Tight, and we PUSH IN CLOSER to see
     the dope evacuating from the punctures, a reverse of Eric's,
     Blood trail.  The dope drips from Darla's arm to the floor.
     Darla's eyes roll up into the unconscious.  She slumps.

     ANGLE - ON FUNBOY - GAWPING

                    FUNBOY
          How the hell did you do that?
          
                    ERIC
          Magic.

     Funboy regards Eric's battlescars and guitar.

                    FUNBOY
          Either die or do a solo.

     Eric looks briefly to his chest wound, wincing.  He can't seem
     to make it tie off fast enough.  He turns his attention back to
     Funboy.  But his strength is mysteriously ebbing.

                    ERIC
          Neither.

                    FUNBOY
          Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.

     Funboy lashes out and broadsides Eric across the temple with the
     gun.  Eric falls, rolls back to a stance, but Funboy is right on
     top of him, howling like a lunatic and pistol-whipping Eric
     relentlessly.

                    FUNBOY
          I hate trespassers!
               (whack!)
          I hate prowlers!
               (whack!)
          I hate peeping toms!
               (whack!)
          And right now I hate you!

     ANGLE - WALL NEAR BATHROOM

     as Eric, caught off-guard by Funboy's hyper high and weakened by
     his wound, comes slamming into the wall, losing his footing.
     Here comes Funboy, and we TILT UP from Eric's position as he 
     looms, cocking the pistol, which now has Eric's blood on it.

                    FUNBOY
          Ahh, the hell with it, I still got
          five shots left.

     In a blur, Eric grabs Funboy`s gun hand.  Twists to the 
     crunching of bones.  Funboy's skewed-around gun hand blows a
     hole in his own thigh.  Funboy fall back across the bed.

                    FUNBOY
          Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what
          you did to my sheets, you lame
          piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!

                    ERIC
          Does it hurt?

                    FUNBOY
          Does it hurt?!  You dead-ass,
          clown-faced fuck, of course it
          fucking hurts!  What the shit are
          you gonna do about this?!

     Eric sits on the bed next to Funboy; inspects the ampule of
     morphine on the nightstand, the needle of the syringe already 
     inserted.

                    ERIC
          I have some pain killer right here.

     And he fills the syringe all the way.

     ANGLE ON FUNBOY

     as he begins to see the light.  He can't get away.  Growing
     terror.

                    FUNBOY
          No, wait, no WAIT, that's too
          much, man, that's like overkill,
          nobody can take that much, you're
          wasting it -- !

                    ERIC
          Your pain ends now.

     And Eric rams the needle into Funboy's heart, driving home
     the full dose.  Funboy begins to convulse.

     Eric falls back on the bed, his force spent.  Darla COMES TO in
     the corner, shock-traumatized.  On O.S. COUGH, and Eric opens
     his eyes.

     The Skull Cowboy, standing in the room, tips his hat.

                    SKULL COWBOY
          Howdy
               (beat)
          You look a mess.  Like an ole
          cooter dog.

     TIGHT SHOT - ERIC'S FACE

     streaked with -- mostly -- his own blood.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - THE SKULL COWBOY AND ERIC

                    SKULL COWBOY
          Getting a little ambitious and
          extracurricular, aren't we?

                    ERIC
          Go away.

                    SKULL COWBOY
          You need to learn to mind your own
          business or you'll never get where
          you think you're going.

                    ERIC
          Shut up.

                    SKULL COWBOY
          Maybe I was wrong about you.

     The Skull Cowboy seems saddened or disappointed.  All we get is
     a little shake of his skull-head.

     Darla makes a SOUND and Eric turns toward her.  She's really
     confused.  She's looking to Eric for some kind of answer.

                    ERIC
          Your daughter is out there, on the
          street, waiting for you.

     She's stunned, utterly speechless.  All she can do is look in
     Eric's eyes, try to ponder the phantoms there.

                    ERIC
          Go.  Now.

     Darla shoves helter-skelter past Eric and out the door without 
     a glance back at Funboy.

     Eric, recovering, follows slowly, staring at the open door,
     stooping to lift the guitar dropped during the fight with 
     Funboy.  The Skull Cowboy has vanished.  PUSH IN.  Grimly, Eric
     takes a syringe and begins to draw blood from the late Funboy.

     INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

     As a hastily dressed Darla BANGS out through the fire stair door
     behind Grange and FLEES the Pit.

                    BOUNCER
          Hey, g'night, Darla.
               (to Grange)
          That there is Darla.

                    GRANGE
          Funboy?

     Bartender indicates UP with his thumb.  Grange moves to the fire
     stairs door.

     INT. FUNBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Grange has seen the door ajar and now ENTERS gun-first.  Freezes
     when he sees:

     GRANGE POV - FUNBOY

     Half-sheeted, bloody, a hypo hanging out of his heart.

     RESUME GRANGE

     Eyes darting, drawn to --

     GRANGE'S POV - THE WALL NEAR FUNBOY

     A crow silhouette spray-painted with a syringe of Funboy's
     blood.  A thin outline, drippy.

     RESUME GRANGE

     whirling with his gun to bring it to bear on --

     ANGLE - GRANGE SEES THE WINDOW

     The crow is no longer in the room.  Eric is perched on the sill,
     guitar and all, looking right at Grange as if waiting from him.
     He winks, holds a finger to his lips -- sshh --and jumps out
     into the night.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - GRANGE

     He almost fires, but doesn't.  We see instead the priceless
     expression on his face as we --

                                   CUT TO:

     INT. PRECINCT FOYER - NIGHT

     Albrecht lights another smoke, quitting for the night.  Waves to
     the late-working Annabella en route.

     EXT. PRECINCT HOUSE - NIGHT

     Albrecht hasn't gone three steps before Eric appears behind him,
     cat silent, matching pace.

     NB:  Eric has got a new black rock-n-roll shirt on... and a
     shell casing from Funboy's gun tied in his hair.

                    ERIC
          Freeze.

     Albrecht startles; drops his file.  Nearly draws his gun.

                    ALBRECHT
          Jeezus!  Don't ever do that, man!

     Albrecht pants, hysterical but calming down.  Eric waits.

                    ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
          I told you cops don't say
          "freeze".

     He retrieves Eric's doctored photo from the spill of papers.

                    ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
          You, my friend, are dead.  I saw
          your body.  You got buried.

                    ERIC
          I saw it, too.

     Albrecht gathers up the file.  Eric stands there.  We realize he
     is hesitant about touching the file.

                    ERIC (CONT'D)
          Walk with me.

     As Albrecht comes up with the file as they walk.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT ON THE STREET

                    ALBRECHT
          You died, man.  I can't believe it
          but here you are.  Last year,
          you and your girlfriend --

                    ERIC
          I need you to tell me what you
          remember.  What happened to us?

                    ALBRECHT
          You went out the window.  She was
          beaten and raped.  She died in the 
          hospital.

     They stop.  Eric didn't know this.  Fixes Albrecht with a look.

                    ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
          Hey, you asked, man.
               (beat)
          She held on for thirty hours in 
          intensive care.  Hemorrhage,
          trauma.  He body just finally
          gave it up.
               (beat; regret)
          I saw it and couldn't do jack for 
          her.

     Eric has grown increasingly distraught over Albrecht's lines.
     Now he turns to Albrecht and, holding Albrecht's temples with
     his fingers, puts his thumbs over Albrecht's eyes.

     TIGHT ON ERIC - ALBRECHT AGAINST WALL

     We see Eric react to a brutal Flash... but we don't see the 
     Flash.

     NEW ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT

     And Eric tears from Albrecht; staggers back, now holding his own
     head.  His crow face slacked in realized horror.

                    ALBRECHT
          You okay, man?  I mean, what just
          happened.

                    ERIC
          The venom of bad memories.  You
          were there; you saw her.  I saw
          you seeing her.

     Understandable nervous, Albrecht lights up a cigarette.

                    ALBRECHT
          You gotta understand -- I was 
          hoping she'd talk, give me a lead,
          a clue, something to work with.
          But she only said one thing to me 
          before she died.

     Eric lowers his head, penitent.

                    ERIC
          My name.

                    ALBRECHT
               (fizzles)
          I'm sorry as hell, man.

                    ERIC
          Thirty hours.  A day of life, plus
          change...

     TIGHT TWO-SHOT - ALBRECHT AND ERIC

     Eric plucks the cigarette from Albrecht's lips, taking a single
     contemplative puff from it.

                    ERIC
          Halloween is coming, soon.  You
          will have Top Dollar if you watch
          for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.

                    ALBRECHT
          I should be trying to stop you.

     Eric nods, keeping his eyes on the cigarette.

                    ERIC
          Thank you.  For giving a damn.

                    ALBRECHT
          My pleasure.
                    ERIC
          Don't smoke these.

     As a bus grumbles past on the street, Eric pitches the butt and 
     simultaneously ducks out of frame.

     ANGLE - ALBRECHT TURNS

     to see a blank building wall.  Fire escape.  Darkness.  No Eric.
     He does a full 360 degree turn.  Eric is gone again.

                    ALBRECHT
          Damn, I wish he wouldn't do that.

     MOVING ANGLE - FROM BUS ROOF

     Coat flapping, Eric is standing on the bus roof as the bus moves
     away from Albrecht's position.

     INT. LAO NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

     Lao has the partially disassembled rat skeleton in front of him, 
     as well as a mortar and pestle with some bits of crushed bone, and
     is smoking powdered rat bone in a pipe and Grange reports to
     him.

                    GRANGE
          The son of a bitch winked at me.
          The he jumped.  Three stories.

     Lao seems strangely unaffected by the bizarre nature of Grange's
     tale.

                    LAO
          Did you see an animal of any kind?
          Did you see a bird?

                    GRANGE
               (puzzled)
          No.  I saw a guitar.
               (beat; irritated)
          This isn't some rock-n-roller
          you forgot to pay, is it?
               (beat)
          There was a drawing on the wall 
          that looked like a bird.  In 
          blood.

     Lao's expression is one of sublime content.

                    LAO
          Good.

                    Grange
          It could've been a chicken...

     EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT - ("CROWVISION")

     A LONG SHOT of the T-Bird parked across the street from the
     store as two figures -- T-Bird and Skank -- approach on the
     store side.

                    SKANK
          I wish to hell I had torched
          Gideon's, that fat fuck.

                    T-BIRD
          I wish to hell I knew who it was
          that made Tin-Tin into a voodoo
          doll last night.

     ANGLE - CLOSER ON T-BIRD AND SKANK - STREET LEVEL

     They stop walking.  Look at each other and sanctimoniously cross 
     themselves.  Tin-Tin's big R.I.P. moment.  T-Bird indicates the
     liquor store.

                    T-BIRD
          We need some smokes and some road
          beers.

                    SKANK
          Got it.

     Skank hustles toward the store.  T-Bird crosses to the car.

     ANGLE - T-BIRD - THROUGH CAR WINDOWS

     WIDEN ANGLE to include the car as he nears it.  Behind him, two
     12-year-old KIDS, AXEL and CHOPPER, enter the store after Skank,
     one wearing a long duster.

     INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

     as the KIDS enter and split between the counter and magazine
     rack.  East Indian CLERK.  Two boys fight video game wars in the
     corner.  Skank browses, grabbing odds and ends.

     EXT. STREET / INT. CAR - LOWER ANGLE - NIGHT

     as T-Bird climbs in, digs the last cigarette from his pack, 
     snaps his Zippo and in the sudden orange light, sees:

     INSERT - REARVIEW MIRROR

     Eric's purloined Strat in the back sear reflecting the light.

     ANGLE - T-BIRD

     He tries to spin and draw his gun but Eric is upon him, nestling
     one of Tin-Tin's throwing knives right inside T-Bird's ear.
          
                    T-BIRD
          What the fuck are you supposed to
          be, man?!

     INSERTS:  Eric liberates T-Bird's automatic from the shoulder 
     holster; Eric's hand closes T-Bird's door for him.

                    ERIC
          I'm your passenger.  You drive.
          And stop talking.

     TIGHT ANGLE - T-BIRD'S HANDS

     on ignition key and gearshift, making ready.  As ordered.

     INT. LIQUOR STORE - ON SKANK AT COUNTER - NIGHT

     He looks outside and sees Eric as the car fires up, pipes and
     glasspacks grumbling.  Skank moves, BRISTLING.

                    SKANK
          What's all this happy horseshit?

     And the car peels out maniacally!  Skank tries to pursue -- but
     the two KIDS draw weapons and freeze everyone in the store.

                    AXEL
          Alright, alright, alright --
          everybody be cool and stay exactly
          where you are.

     Chopper hustles up to the counter and relieves Skank of a 
     gigantic Auto Mag.

                    CHOPPER
          Whooooa, cowboy!  Cool gun.

     Off Skank's look of total outfoxed disgust.--

     INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELING FAST - NIGHT

     Vertiginous windshield POV of onrushing street, highspeed.

                    ERIC (O.S.)
          Faster, T-Bird.  Faster.  You're
          a hell of a wheelman; you know you
          can drive faster.

     ANGLE - ERIC AND T-BIRD

     Eric now holds T-Bird's own gun on him.  Eyes locked on T-Bird.
     T-Bird's jump between Eric's nightmare visage and the roadway.

                    T-BIRD
          You call it, blood -- you got the
          gun. You just tell me where you want
          to go.

     Clearly T-Bird would relish bisecting Eric with a meat cleaver 
     as he says this.  He's nervous and needs to hold the road.

                    ERIC
          That's good.  We're going 
          someplace you've never been
          before.

     EXT. STREET - HIGH ANGLE ON T-BIRD - NIGHT

     as the car burns up the obstacle course of pavement, kicking  
     wake of litter.  PEDESTRIANS scurry to clear the way.

     INT. POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT

     Parked in an alley, facing the street.  Two cops work on large
     styro cups of steaming coffee.  MJ (driver) and SPEEG.

                    MJ
          Smells like rain.

                    SPEEG
          Smells like a septic tank.  You
          got that cream stuff?

                    MJ
          In the bag.

     Speeg rummages inside the takeout bag.

                    SPEEG   
          I hate this cream stuff.  They
          can't even call it cream, legally.

     They snap to as the T-Bird blazes past, doing ninety.

                    MJ
          What in the crap?

     MJ floors the pedal, drenching Speeg in coffee on takeoff.

                    SPEEG
          Ow! Owowoowowoowo, goddammit!

     EXT. STREET - ON ALLEY - NIGHT

     as the cruiser roars out to give chase.

     INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELLING FAST - NIGHT

     Eric lends the chase car a backward look.

                    ERIC
          You caught one.  Drive faster.

                    T-BIRD
          Man, you gonna get us killed dead
          and I don't even know what you
          want!

     Eric cocks T_Bird's pistol and levels it at his face.

                    ERIC
          I want you to stop talking.  And 
          drive.  Drive faster.

     Eric rifles the glove box, tossing items out the window: clips
     for the gun.  Sunglasses.  A giant dildo (brief eyebrows-up to
     T-Bird).  Then: a roll of (previously established) gaffer's
     tape.  What Eric needs.

     ANGLE - T-BIRD AND REARVIEW MIRROR

     as he sees a second cop car join the high speed pursuit, 

                    ERIC (CONT'D)
          You're very popular.  Thought
          you could handle this thing.

     T-Bird macho calcifies.  He's going to win.

                    T-BIRD
          To hell with you.

                    ERIC
               (wry)
          Naturally.

     INSERT - SPEEDOMETER

     Climbing swiftly toward the 100 mark.


     EXT. CITY STREETS - VARIOUS ANGLES - THE CHASE - NIGHT

     A 3-way pursuit until the T-Bird reaches the outskirts of the
     city.

     EXT. DOCKSIDE STREET - NIGHT

     All quiet... until the T-Bird ZOOMS past frame.  The lead cop
     tries to duplicate the T-Bird's corner-cut and starts spinning.
     It clips a light pole.  Rebounds into the path of MJ's unit.

     INT. POLICE CRUISER - ON SPEEG AND MJ - TRAVELING - NIGHT

     as MJ stands on the brakes.  Collision imminent.  They howl.

     EXT. DOCKSIDE STREET - NIGHT

     as MJ's unit broadsides the first cop car.

     EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - NIGHT

     The T-bird careens through dockside silence, alone, then
     fishtails, SCREECHING, to a lung-compressing halt.

     INT. T-BIRD - ON ERIC AND T-BIRD - NIGHT

     T-bird respirating like a jackhammer.  Eric holds stoic.

                    T-BIRD
          So what -- you gonna rape me now?

                    ERIC
          Time for your reward, T.  Payback
          with interest earned.

     Eric rips a long strip of tape from the roll.

     EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - NIGHT

     A HIGH ANGLE of the car as Eric opens the trunk.

     ERIC'S POV - The Trunk.

     loaded with plastique, canisters, timers, arson paraphernalia.

     INT. T-BIRD - FAVOR T-BIRD - NIGHT

     SLOW TILT starting with T-Bird's foot, firmly taped to the
     pedal.  Mummified into his seat.  Hands taped to the wheel.
     Throat taped hard against the headrest.

     The car is now in gear, idling.

     ANGLE - ON ERIC FROM WINDOW

     He drops an incendiary right into T-Bird's lap.  T-Bird squirms.
     No go.  Eric reaches in with a bungie cord.

                    ERIC
          A little restrictive?  Good.
               (chilling)
          You held her down and raped her.
          You were the first.  She burned
          while you were inside of her.
               (re: bomb)
          What's the lag on this?  About
          twenty seconds, would you say?

     T-bird thrashes, but he's immobilized.  Can't even budge the
     wheel.

                    ERIC (CONT'D)
          I've comrades in hell, T-bird.
          Give them my best.

     Eric activates the timer.  Yanks up hard on the bungie cord.

     INSERT: T-BIRD FOOTWELL

     The bungie cord pulls T-Bird's foot all the way down on the
     pedal.

     ANGLE - ON CAR, FROM DOCKSIDE

     Eric steps back, plucks the guitar out as the car starts to move.  The
     car roars for the edge of the dock, about a distance of a
     football field.  Eric examines T-bird's auto pistol and pops the
     clip.

     INTERCUTS:  as the car speeds for the water's edge, Eric thumbs
     bullets from the clip, one by one.

     INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELING FAST - NIGHT

     T-bird's eyes bug in horror and he goes MMMMMMMMHHH!

     CLOSE-UP - THE CLIP IN ERIC'S HAND

     thumbing out the final bullet.

     EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT

                    ERIC
          All gone.

     ANGLE - T-BIRD REACHES DOCKSIDE

     Lifting off and blowing all to hell, a billion smithereens of
     phosphorescent firs pattering into the dark water.  It hits.
     Sinks.  Weird flare glow as the car quickly submerges.

     ANGLE - ERIC

     heaving the gun into the distant water.  Plosh.  He produces T-
     Bird's accelerator.  Squirts it into the ground.  He
     prestidigitates and T-Bird's Zippo appears in his hand.  He 
     flicks it and drops it into the flammable puddle.

     HIGH LONG SHOT - ERIC

     walking slowly out of the scene as the firepool coalesces into
     a burning crow shape. 

     INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAWN

     CLOSE-UP of a frying pan busy burning some pretty firebombed
     looking eggs.  Kind gross.

     ANGLE - DARLA AT THE STOVE.

     NOT THRILLED WITH HER OWN PROGRESS.

                    DARLA
          I never was too good at this 
          domestic shit.

     ANGLE - ELLY AT LIVING ROOM WINDOW

     staring outside at nothing in particular.  Yet.

                    ELLY
          Don't say "shit".
               (beat)
          That's okay.  Corn Flakes are
          okay.  Anything.

     She pauses as she hears a lilting, faraway GUITAR STRAIN.
     Across the street she can make out the figure of Eric on his 
     roof playing the guitar.

     EXT. ROOF OF LOFT BUILDING DAWN

     EXTREME CLOSE of a Pignose Amp.  More soft GUITAR strokes as
     CAMERA FOLLOWS a patchwork a taped-together, jerry-rigged
     cables to:

     ANGLE - ERIC ON ROOF -- shirtless, crosslegged, his Crow make-up
     streaked by the night's work.  His fingering is unsure and he 
     tries the tune again.

     INSERT - We she Shelly's engagement ring on a leather thong
     around Eric's neck.  Like an amulet.

     ANGLE - ERIC PLAYING

     He's got it right this time.  Strong, sure CHORDS.  Passionate.
     We can almost imagine him conjuring Shelly via musical sorcery.
     He holds a stroke, letting it ring.  Sun rises behind him.

                    IRATE VOICE (O.S.)
          Hey, shut the fuck up!

     Eric's eyes, closed with the moment, dart left.  Funny.

     EXT. MAXI-DOGS - DAY

     Later.  Elly is seated on a stool..  Mickey gives her a chili
     dog.

                    MICKEY
          Chili dog for breakfast... it's
          original.

                    ELLY
          Mom tried to cook.

                    MICKEY
          Oh.

                    CUSTOMER (O.S.)
          Hey, Mickey, I need a special
          with everything.  No sawdust.

                    MICKEY
               (to Elly)
          Everyone's a comedian.  Enjoy.

     Mickey EXITS FRAME.

                    GRANGE (O.S.)
          You're Elly, right?  I know your
          mom.

     Elly turns.  Grange sits next to her.  Lao's mirrored-windowed car
     is parked across the street, b.g.

                    ELLY
          A lot of people "know" my mom.

     Grange points o.s., indicating he wants coffee from Mickey.

                    GRANGE
          I know your friend, too -- the one
          that looks like a rock star.

                    ELLY
          I don't know you.

                    GRANGE
               (easily)
          I'd like to get in touch with him.

     Elly sizes Grange up.

                    ELLY
          You're not a cop, either.  What do
          you want him for?

                    GRANGE
          I'm looking for a good guitar man.

                    ELLY
          Right.

     Grange withdraws a $10 bill from his wallet and slides it across
     the countertop to Mickey.

                    ELLY (CONT'D)
          You buying?
               (cuts him some slack)
          He kinda wanders around.  You'll
          see him if you pay attention.

                    GRANGE
          I need to find him kind of soon,
          Elly.


     INT. LOFT - ON ERIC - DAY

     No shirt, the ring on the thong around his neck -- workout mode.

     He twirls and performs odd Crow moves of increasing complexity
     in the big open living room.  On purpose, he stretches hard
     against the bedroom doorframe.

     FLASH:  Shelly stands in the blue moonlight near the picture window
     wearing a rococo Victorian gown.  PUSH IN TIGHT as she is
     embraced by a nude Eric.  He undoes the last few remaining ties
     that hold the gown in place.  FOLLOW THE GOWN as it crumples
     down the length of Shelly's (also otherwise nude) body to the
     floor...

                                   FLASH ENDS.

     LOW ANGEL - FROM INSIDE THE BEDROOM - ON ERIC

     hanging there, inviting the pain the FLASHES bring.  Breathing
     as though he is pumping iron, pumping up.

     ANGLE - LATER - ERIC IN BEDROOM

     embracing a ragged full-length dress that used to be Shelly's.

     FLASH: Eric and Shelly (wearing the same dress), exchange an
     extremely passionate and intimate KISS in the moonlight.

                                   FLASH ENDS.

     ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC

     as he drops the dress.  Absorbing the pain and memories.

     ANGLE - LATER - ERIC IN LIVING ROOM

     executing a complex roll that winds him up at the windowsill.
     He grasps it with both hands.

     FLASH:  A series of CLOSE SHOTS of Eric and Shelly's HANDS, each
     moving along the other's body.  Curves and dips and contours.
     But Eric's gaze never leaves SHelly's eyes.

                                   FLASH ENDS.

     ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AT WINDOW

     His GAZE similarly FIXED.  Bringing his hands away and clapping
     them together, deep breath, fingertips pressed to his face, like
     Kung Fu prep.  When he opens his eyes, the crow is there before
     him on the sill.

                    ERIC
          That's better.

     He wipes his torso down with a towel.

                    ERIC (CONT'D)
          It's almost time.

     He holds his hand in front of his face and he flexes it.  We can
     HEAR tendons CRACKLE like a harness.  Closes it into a powerful
     fist.

     INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

     TIGHT on Skank as he slams his fist down on the table.  He has
     a black eye and facial scuffs from his liquor store encounter.

                    SKANK
          Top, I made the sumbitch!  Face
          all painted white like some kinda
          fuckin' kabuki homo!

     WIDE ANGLE to include all present:  Lao, Grange, Lao Guards #1 
     and #2, Top Dollar, and a Sentry.  Top dusts up a line and
     rinses his nostrils with brandy.

                    LAO
          Sounds like our "Crow" is
          out-maneuvering you.

                    TOP DOLLAR
          "Our" Crow...?

                    LAO
          Come now.  You've seen the 
          graffiti -- all over the city in
          the few hors it has taken your
          men to drop like plague victims.
          What about your turf, Top?
               (mockingly)
          You don't seem to have ripped out
          anyone's heart yet.

                    TOP DOLLAR
               (pissed off)
          The night is young.

                    SKANK
               (hot)
          The found T-bird flash-fried to
          what was left of his fucking car!

     Top is angry too, but won't show it to Lao.  He rises and goes
     to the window.  Neon glow.  Top sees something outside, below,
     that really torques him off.

     EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SHOWTIME - NIGHT (TOP'S POV)

     A phantom GRAFFITI ARTIST is spray-painting a crow shape on the
     condemned building right across the street.

     INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

     Top whip-drawing an auto pistol and shooting below.

                    TOP DOLLAR
          Hey, you little fuckweed!  That's
          against the law!

     His gun smoking.  Momentary empowerment.

                    TOP DOLLAR (CONT'D)
          I don't give a shit what kinda
          bird this guy is.

     EXT. WINDOW - NIGHT

     As Top turns from the window,  PULL BACK to incorporate the
     chunky shadows where the lights don't fall.  Eric is there,
     perched on the narrow exterior ledge...but we don't know it
     until he opens his eyes, two dots of white in the blackness.

     INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

     LAO AT TABLE -- angered by this macho horseshit, annoyed at his
     time being frittered.

                    LAO
          I am sitting over here.

     He SLAMS a palm on the table and the room goes silent.  Top
     looks sheepish.

                    LAO (CONT'D)
          Do you think this childish
          machismo impresses me?
               (regains composure)
          When I was a boy in Saigon I
          watched my country change one 
          block at a time,  one building at
          a time.  Whole lives erased.  A
          way of life, polluted.  Today, no 
          one forces me to move.  I use my
          powers to change your country, one
          block at a time,  one building at
          a time.

                    TOP DOLLAR
          Nice speech.  What's it supposed
          to mean?

                    LAO
          Your comprehension is not
          required.  Your cooperation and,
          indeed, your ability are the
          issues on the table.

     Top rallies to this.

                    TOP DOLLAR
          Whatever you say, I can do.

     Skank looks around, nervous and jumpy, a contradiction to Top's
     guarantee.

                    LAO
          That's reassuring.

     CLOSE-UP - TOP'S SHELL CASING IN ERIC'S HAND

     from the ledge.  Endstamp is for a .45 caliber.

     ANGLE - ERIC ON LEDGE

     He sniffs the cartridge.  We can see Funboy's cartridge in his
     hair.  He fists the shell casing tightly.

     ANGLE - DOWN-TABLE, AT SKANK

     Jittery, grabbing a clip for his own automatic.

                    SKANK
          What was that -- !?

     It wasn't anything.  Skank loads, stands and jacks the action on
     his gun.  Lao looks questioningly to Top Dollar.

                    TOP DOLLAR
          Too many poppers, Skank.  Relax.  Heel.

     ANGLE - WINDOW BEHIND TOP DOLLAR

     A black blur as Eric arches through, spilling Top.

     ANGLE - MEN SEATED AT TABLE

     Eric back flips the length of the table and kicks the gun from
     Skank's hand.  All react.  Weapons out.

     CLOSE-UP - SKANK'S GUN

     spinning mid-air to land in Eric's open hand!

     GENERAL ANGLE - BIG MOBY SHOOTOUT - (VARIOUS)

     Death cleans house.  Standing on the table, Eric fires rearward
     under his own arm to clip Lao Guard #1.  He pivots, shooting,
     and takes out Lao Guard #2 -- who slams backward into the steel
     door as it being opened by the Sentry outside.  Crash!  The
     door is shut again.

     ANGLE - GRANGE AND LAO

     Grange sprays the room with a Calico 950 Auto, shoving Lao
     beneath the table for cover.

     ANGLE - ERIC

     Bullets hit him and demolish everything behind him.  Skank hits
     the deck again.  Eric fires and Lao Guard #1 sucks three hits 
     across the chest, firing convulsively against the ceiling, blowing
     the lights.

     ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR

     springing up from behind table.  But Eric is gone from the field
     of fire and one shot strikes Skank, rising at the far end.

     ANGLE - LAO AND GRANGE

     making for the door, Grange as shield.  Lao draws a pistol.  The door
     opens and Lao shoots a Sentry to clear him out of the way.

     ANGLE - TIGHTER ON LAO

     A last look back toward Eric and Grange hustle Lao out.

     Door SLAM o.s.  Top is out of ammo as Eric lands from above
     frame right in front of him and slaps the gun from his hand.

                    TOP DOLLAR
               (awed but maintained)
          You want my attention, man you
          got it.

     ANGLE - SKANK UNDER TABLE

     Wounded but clawing toward Eric just the same.

                    SKANK
          It's him, Top!  He dusted T-Bird!

     ANGLE - ERIC AND TOP DOLLAR, FACE-TO-FACE

                    ERIC
          You have to be SKank.
               (to Top Dollar)
          One moment.

     As he speaks, WIDEN FRAME as he turns and grabs the incoming
     Skank by the hair.

                    ERIC
          Thank of a snappy comeback for me
          on your way down.

     Without a beat he pitches Skank right out the window!  Skank howls
     all the way down.

     EXT. STREET - ON POLICE CAR - NIGHT

     Damaged from the wreck, limping home, piloted by our pals Speeg
     and MJ.  Skank smashes down into the roof, imploding the
     flashbar and windshield.  MJ drenches his lap in fresh coffee.

                    MJ
          OwwwAAHHH son of a BITCH!

     ANGLE - SIDEWALK ACROSS THE STREET - ON ALBRECHT

     who watches with slow marvel from the shadows
                    ALBRECHT
          Jesus Christ...

     He runs to assist the demolished cruiser.

     INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - RESUMING - NIGHT

     Just Top, Eric, corpses, and lazily drifting gunsmoke.

                    ERIC
          Top Dollar, you're the only one
          here still wasting good air...

                    TOP DOLLAR
          Five large, in the drawer right 
          over there.  I never saw you.

                    ERIC
          Do you know what you destroyed?

                    TOP DOLLAR
          Take the dope, too.

     Eric backhands Top into the wall.  Gets in his face, seething.

                    ERIC
          A year ago.  A very nice lady
          circulated a petition.  She died.
          Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.

                    TOP DOLLAR
          That's ancient history.

                    ERIC
          It's yesterday!  Do you know what
          you destroyed?

     Top Dollar yells right back at Eric's anger.

                    TOP DOLLAR
          Who gives a fuck!  I'm a
          businessman.  You gonna do me,
          then do me and shut you're face!

                    ERIC
          You don't even remember...

                    TOP DOLLAR
          I never forget anything, dickhead.
          That building was a sweep-and-
          clear; the bitch was a nuisance
          with her goddamned petition.  It
          got a little rowdy... end of
          story.

                    ERIC
          Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps 
          for you.

     And he grabs Top's head the way he grabbed ALbrecht's earlier,
     slams Top into the wall.  Nose-to-nose.

     FLASH:  Shelly backing away from oncoming Funboy in the loft,
     trying to retreat, nowhere to run, her home invaded, scared.

                                   FLASH ENDS.

     ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC

     Top is quivering, almost helpless in Eric's hypnotic grasp.
     Eric winces, hard, and --

     FLASH:  Shelly cut, bleeding, struggling against T-Bird.  Wild.

                                   FLASH ENDS.

     ANGLE - RESUMING TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC

     Viciously close, more intimate and lethal than anything.

                    ERIC
          You're a detail man, Top -- you
          need to see more.

     This time Top tries to twist from Eric's grasp but it's no good.

     FLASH: Shelly, comatose in ICU, eyes fixed and staring, 
     hoses darting in and out, cold blue refrigerator light.

     Bloody, bruised and broken (from Albrecht;s memory)

                                   FLASH ENDS.

     CLOSE-UP - TOP DOLLAR

     arching, stiffening in pain.

     CLOSE-UP - TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC

                    ERIC
          All of her pain, Top.  Thirty
          hours.  All at once...

     Eric bears down on Top Dollar again.  Top screams.  Blood begins
     to leak from his eyes, nose, ears.

                    ERIC (CONT'D)
          ...all for you.

     FLASH:  Rapidfire CLOSE-UPS.  A jagged compound fracture,
     jutting, Shelly's eye, blood-red sclera, purpled and sunken.

     Her scraped-raw hand clawing at air.  Icebox lighting.  A TIGHT
     SHOT of her monitor going flatline: eeeeeeeeeeeeee...

     TWO-SHOT - RESUMING ERIC AND TOP DOLLAR.

     as Top sags in Eric's grasp, terror fixing his wide-staring dead
     eyes.  Eric lets him drop like a laundry sack.

                    ERIC
          I didn't think you could handle it
          either.

     O.S. BANG of impact, heavy against the steel door.  Eric turns.

     ANGLE - STEEL DOOR

     as it is battered down by a squad of police using a power-ram.
     All weapons snap up to bear on Eric.

                    LEAD SWAT
          That's all she wrote, Bozo!  You
          stand down now, and that's an
          order!

     ANGLE - ERIC AS HE MOVES

     using his foot to shove the massive conference table at the 
     incoming SWATS while launching himself into the air, flipping
     toward the window and arching through cleanly as the cops open
     fire on command.  Bullets tear the room to pieces.

                    LEAD SWAT
          The fire escape's covered.

     EXT. SHOWTIME - FRONT FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

     Picking up Eric on his dive through the window, bullets chasing
     him.  Immediate police fire from below sparks off the ironwork.
     Eric ducks slugs balletically and scampers to the roof.

     ANGLE - SHOWTIME ROOFTOP EDGE

     Eric somersaults over.  Bullets chip brick in his wake.

     STREET LEVEL - UP ANGLE TOWARD ROOF.

     Showtime girded police cars and MARKSMEN, Eric a distant
     shadow figure above.  Here comes a TEAM LEADER with a bullhorn.

                    TEAM LEADER (FILTERED)
          On the roof!  Keep firing!  Keep
          firing!

     A fury of law enforcement ordnance cuts loose all around him.

     RESUMING ERIC ON SHOWTIME ROOF EDGE

     A forearm up against the fusillade.  Below him --

     ANGLE - PIT FRONT FIRE ESCAPE 

     Here come Lead SWAT and his Merry MEN.

     MOVING ANGLE - WITH ERIC - ADJACENT ROOFTOP

     Eric runs for it.  Half a story higher.  He hits the wall and
     skitters up, gripping tiny cracks in the brickwork.

     ANGLE - RESUMING MEN ON FRONT SHOWTIME FIRE ESCAPE.

     Lead SWAT hesitates -- because of what he sees.

                    LEAD SWAT
          Holy shit, it's spiderman.

     He tries to pull a bead and fires too late.

                    LEAD SWAT (CONT'D)
          What're you boy scouts staring at!
          Let's Go!  Let's go!  Let's go!

     MOVING ANGLE - PICKING UP ERIC ON NEXT ROOF

     He sprints to the far edge and dives to the next lower rooftop.
     As he lands he is nailed by a helicopter spotlight, boring in 
     from behind and above the row of buildings.

     MOVING ANGLE - THE STREET BELOW

     COPS below, COPS in the chopper, everyone rushing parallel to 
     Eric, trying to keep up.

     ERIC'S POV - THE STREET, THE HELICOPTER

     PAN QUICK to the next ledge.  COPS right behind him on the roof
     as well.

     WITH ERIC - AS HE RUNS TO THE EDGE.

     and finds a void waiting there.  No connecting building.

     ANOTHER MOVING ANGLE - ERIC

     staying ahead of the search light.  A fantastic series of artful
     moves that wind him up at the rear edge of the roof.

     ANGLE - SWAT MEN ON NEXT ROOF

     sighting Eric as the light picks him out.  Eric glances at 
     them... then jumps.

                    CHOPPER PILOT (O.S./FILTERED)
          He's off the roof.  We can't see
          him.

     CLOSE-UP - LEAD SWAT

     pulling his weapon off target, because there is not target.  

                    LEAD SWAT
          Dammit to hell!
               (beat; to men)
          Come on.

     ANGLE - ALLEY - STREET LEVEL

     Eric lands like a falling safe, scattering garbage.  But he's 
     okay, up and running.

     ANGLE - ERIC'S RUNNING POV - END OF ALLEY

     as his escape is cut off by a police car that screeches to a 
     stop, blocking the exit.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC

     as he backpedals, scanning for an alternate escape.

                    ALBRECHT
               (from car)
          Come on!

     CLOSER ANGLE  - POLICE CAR

     We can see Albrecht.  Eric dives inside and the car burns rubber.

     INT. ALBRECHT'S CAR - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

     Albrecht harried and frantic, but in control.

                    ALBRECHT
          Keep your head down!

     He twists and turns the car, glancing rearward for pursuit.  

     Gradually he calms down.

                    ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
          I figured you might need a ride 
          home.

     Eric looks up at him from his half-concealed crouch.

                    ERIC
          It's done.
                    ALBRECHT
          I figured as much.  Did you cap
          off Funboy.

                    ERIC
          Funboy had to leave this mortal 
          coil.

                    ALBRECHT
          Yeah, among others.
               (sees Eric's condition)
          Hey, man -- you're hit.

                    ERIC
          It's only a flesh wound.

                    ALBRECHT
          It's only fourteen or fifteen 
          flesh wounds.

     Eric sits up as the car gains distance.  Grabs the cigarette out 
     of ALbrecht's mouth.  Takes his single puff.

                    ERIC
          You shouldn't smoke these.

     He pitches the smoke out the open car window.

                    ALBRECHT
          Great.  Litterbug of the Living
          Dead.

     Eric turns back to Albrecht.

                    ERIC
          I'm finished.

     Eric shoots him a doubtful look.

                    ERIC (CONT'D)
          I mean, I've done what I came to
          do.  It shouldn't hurt this much.
          But it will pass...

                    ALBRECHT
               (not buying it)
          Right.
               (beat)
          You sure I can't just take you to 
          the emergency ward?

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT - ON ALBRECHT'S CAR

     It hangs a turn and their escape is made.

                    ERIC (O.S.)
          They couldn't do anything for me.

                    ALBRECHT (O.S.)
          How 'bout the morgue?

                    ERIC (O.S.)
          No.  I have one more thing to do.

     EXT. STREET - ANOTHER PART OF THE CITY - NIGHT

     Lonelier, less traffic, more deserted.

     ANGLE - ON ALBRECHT AND ERIC THROUGH WINDSHIELD - TRAVELLING

                    ALBRECHT
          You're gonna kill somebody else.
               (beat; no response)
          We're gonna stop and get a shit-load
          of Band-Aids?

     Eric is obviously fighting to stay centered, stay conscious.
     His last fight has caused him a great deal of damage, taken a
     lot out of him.  He needs to recharge.

                    ERIC
          I have to prepare for an 
          anniversary.  This coming night.

     HOLD on their two kinds of determination. as we

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. CITYSCAPE - DAY

     High blue sky.  It might even be pretty if it wasn't Detroit.

     INT. LAO'S CLUB OFFICE - DAY

     The TV flybank pulses with videotaped images of Club Trash's of
     various performers -- including Diabolique.  On several screens,
     one-by-one, various images of a guitar-playing Eric Draven
     FREEZE-FRAME as we PULL BACK to the desk.  Lao has the 8x10 from
     the corridor gallery.  He places it within eyeshot and resumes
     work on the desk BELOW FRAME;  we can't see it yet, among other
     scattered research and inconcubula.

     ANGLE - GRANGE

     Entering and crossing to the desk.  As he comes up to the desk,
     he DRAWS BACK.

                    GRANGE
          What... the hell is that?

                    LAO
               (calmly)
          This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes,
          it is real.

     NEW ANGLE - LAO AND GRANGE

     Revealing Lao with a sealed cage, holding a large, live cobra in
     his hands.  The killing blade is nearby.

                    GRANGE
          That thing is poisonous.

                    LAO
          Extremely so.
               (beat)
          You and I are the recipients of
          unwanted good fortune, in the form 
          of a man everyone is calling The Crow.

     Grange makes a face.  Can't keep his eyes off the cobra.

                    GRANGE
          Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...

                    LAO
          I intend no slight to you, but I
          cannot find the English to
          adequately express just what he
          is.  I suppose Western mythology
          would describe him as a Fury.
          
                    GRANGE
          Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet.

     Lao chuckles indulgently.

                    LAO
          Do you know of spirit assassins?
          You do know the dead can rise?
          Properly motivated, of course.

                    GRANGE
          Like some sort of zombie on a 
          revenge trip.

                    LAO
          Mmm.  But tonight I can take what
          is his.

                    GRANGE
          Only thing you'll get from that
          clown is a faster way to die.
                    LAO
          To the contrary...

     ZZLIP!  Lao smoothly BEHEADS the snake with the Blade against
     the stone surface of the desk and discards the writhing body.
     He squeezes behind one of the eyes and a VENOM SAC protrudes
     like a dark pimento.

     LAO pulls it free of the milky, clinging tissue and EATS IT.
     Off Grange's stunned expression.

                    LAO (CONT'D)
          ...all the dying tonight will be 
          done by the former Eric Draven.

     Lao exhibits the blade to Grange as though it explains all.

                    LAO (CONT'D)
          Who is only invulnerable so long
          as he cares about the dead.  When
          he begins to care about the living,
          you'll find his heart can bleed...
          and I want it to bleed for me.

                    GRANGE
          Kill a dead guy?

     Lao POPS the second venom sac; swallows it.  Pleased.

                    LAO
          Truly kill him.  So I may crush
          his skull and smoke it.

     Lao SHRUGS.  Grange can handle it.

                    LAO (CONT'D)
          Let it suffice that I need him...
          and to get to him, we'll need his 
          little friend.

     Finally, an assignment Grange can comfortable understand. 

     INT. LOFT - DAY

     Eric, barechested, emotionally tapped, clean of makeup and blood
     but exhausted, his movements retarded and slack.  Staring
     fixedly into the fireplace,  where he burns everything he could
     find of his past:  the junk from the makeup table, the masques,
     photos of himself and Shelly.

     INT. LOFT - STAIRWELL - DAY

     Moving with Elly as she nears the open loft door.  She PEEKS
     cautiously inside.

     RESUME ERIC

     Without looking toward the door, he speaks.

                    ELLY
          What's going on...?

                    ERIC
          A remembrance.
               (beat)
          A closure.

     And Eric consigns to the fire the DRESS we saw earlier.

     Holds a photograph in a broken frame.  Cracked glass.  Subject:
     Eric and Shelly, goofing for the camera.

     He chucks it into the fire.  Draws a deep breath.

                    ERIC
          Better now.  I feel good.  How are
          you, Elly, my friend?

     Elly is clearly uncomfortable, groping for an excuse just to see 
     Eric.  Eric is staring at her, intently.

                    ERIC
          What is it?
                    ELLY
          I knew.  I knew I knew you.  Even
          with the makeup and stuff you
          wore.
               (beat)
          You really loved her, didn't you?

     CLOSE-UP - FIREPLACE

     The photo burns and blackens in the grate.

                    ERIC
          You brought flowers.  As long as 
          you don't forget her, Elly, she 
          lives.

                    ELLY
               (upset)
          She's dead.  She's gone.  And now
          you're just gonna go away and
          never come back, too.  I hate this
          place; it isn't fair.

                    ERIC
          Elly...

     He draws her close.  Wipes away an errant tear with his thumb.

                    ERIC (CONT'D)
          Sometimes the people we care about
          are gone, for no reason.  Sometimes
          that's really tough.  I cry.  But if 
          the people we love are gone, we keep them --

     He taps Elly's temple, then his won.

                    ERIC (CONT'D)
          -- right here.  It's a big
          responsibility.  And that makes it 
          okay to mourn.
               (beat)
          I know that if you weren't here,
          I'd be very sad.

     Elly gives Eric a hug.

                    ELLY
          You look funny without your white
          face on.  Like it's your day off
          or something.

     He quizzical expression amuses him.

                    ERIC
          Somebody here wants to meet you. Gabriel?

     Gabriel the cat has wandered near the fireplace to join them.  
     Elly is immediately smitten.  Happy.
          
                    ELLY
          I remember him!  Here, Gabriel...
          here kitty... Gabriel... Is he
          still yours?

                    ERIC
          I think he's yours, now.

     The cat seems to like that idea.  Elly wraps him hugely up in
     her arms, talking to him: "How're you, Gabriel, whatcha doin'"

     ANOTHER ANGLE - TIGHTER ON ERIC

     While Elly is preoccupied with the cat, Eric gives up his last
     bit of Shelly to the fire - a portrait photo of her, small and 
     creased.  He puts it in the fire, watches it burn for a beat,
     then turns to Elly.

                    ERIC (CONT'D)
          I have something else for you.

     BACK FOCUS as Eric lifts off his neck Shelly's ring for Elly's
     inspection.  The ring twirls large in f.g.

                    ELLY
          Nobody ever gave me something like
          that before.  Ever.

     Eric places it around her neck.  Elly BEAMS.

                    ERIC
          Shelly would've wanted you to have
          it.  This way, you'll think of her 
          every time you see it...

                    ELLY
          And she'll be alive.  Up here.

     Elly TAPS her own temple with a smile, keeping one hand on the
     ring.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. STREET - DAY

     Blowing wind.  TRICK-OR-TREATERS wisp past.  Ghosts, witches,
     demons out for Halloween.

     ANGLE - CEMETERY FENCE

     walking home with Gabriel zipped up inside her coat is Elly.  A
     fire engine wails past in the opposite direction.

     ANGLE - ELLY ON BROWNSTONE STEPS

     Strictly downscale building.  Elly to Gabriel"

                    ELLY
          You're gonna like it here.

     A car curbs across the street as she enters the building.

     ANGLE - PUSH IN ON CAR

     as the window cranks down to reveal Grange at the wheel.

     INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Darla nervously smoking, doing her best to stay clean, but
     jittery.  Elly enters the shabby living room with Gabriel in her
     arms.

                    DARLA
          I was wonderin' where you'd
          gotten to --
               (she sees Gabriel)
          Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?

                    ELLY
          He was a present.  Besides, we're
          moving anyway.  You said.

                    DARLA
          We'll discuss this later.
          Obviously.  You left the door open.

     DARLA points.  As Elly goes to close the door it opens.

     NEW ANGLE - FAVOR THE DOOR

     Grange enters accompanied by two Asian martial arts STRONGARMS
     (Lao Guards #3 & #4).  Grange looks around, bemused, his manner
     avuncular.

                    GRANGE
          Hi, Elly.  Remember me?

     Elly's surprise is evident.  Darla is just plain pissed off.

                    DARLA
          I don't remember you.  And I don't
          remember inviting...

                    GRANGE
               (to his MEN)
          If she opens her face again, shoot
          her in the head.

     ANGLE - DARLA

     Mouth stalling in the ON position as Lao Guard #3 pulls a 
     gigantic gun, draws and cocks.

                    ELLY
               (panicked)
          Mom -- !

     ANGLE - GUARD #4 AND ELLY

     as he scoops her up, captive.

     ANGLE - GRANGE AND GABRIEL

     He strolls the circuit of the room, stopping near the window.

                    GRANGE
          You should listen to your mother.
          She said no cats.

     Grange pitches Gabriel right out the window.

                    ELLY
          Gabriel!

     Grange pulls out a compact Polaroid camera.

                    GRANGE
          Now that's the expression I want.

     ANGLE - ELLY AND GUARD #4

     As she struggle mightily, to no avail, as Grange moves in to
     snap his shot.

                    GRANGE (CONT'D)
          Say cheese.

     He snaps.  On the SX-70 WHIRR and flash white-out, we --

     EXT. LOFT BUILDING ROOFTOP - SUNSET

     Dark clouds have gathered to highlight the sunset.  Eric plays
     the guitar - LOUD, the SHelly theme in a major key.  Where
     before it was wandering, uncertain, now it's bold and
     heartbreaking.  Definitive.  Pain replaced by strength and a
     sense of homecoming.

     As Eric gets to the end of it, the notes are flying out... At
     the climax, rips the guitar up over his head and brings it 
     down -- SMASH -- on the Pignose.  He's finished here.

     ROOF EDGE - FROM STREET

     as the broken guitar SAILS OUT over the building edge.

     INT. LOFT BUILDING STAIRWELL - DUSK

     As Eric comes down the stairs.  Notices the open door.

     INT. LOFT - DUSK

     He enters, cautiously, to find an envelope laying in the middle
     of the floor.  He opens it.

     INSERT - THE POLAROID OF ELLY

     with a note.

     UP ANGLE AT ERIC READING THE NOTE - FROM FLOOR

     The crow flies past behind him as his expression hardens.

     NEW ANGLE -  A MOMENT LATER - FAST AND HARD

     Eric brutally crisscrosses his arms with black vinyl tape.

     ANGLE - ERIC DRESSING

     Pulling on black night-fighting clothes, skintight.

     ANGLE - THE VANITY

     as Eric (seen in mirror) jabs his fingers into the white
     makeup and smears it on.

                                   SMASH CUT TO:

     EXT. STREET NEAR CEMETERY - NIGHT

     Eric marches along in plain view since everyone around him seems
     to be in costume.  The wind whips his coat.  KIDS bustle around
     him with trick-or-treat bags.  The crow perched on his shoulder.

     ERIC'S POV - CITY SKYLINE

     Somewhere, a few blocks over, a building is burning.

     ANGLE - ERIC WALKING

     A fire engine races past on the street.  He steps out in its
     wake and crosses over to --

     MEDIUM MOVING SHOT - THE CEMETERY

     waiting for him as he crosses to the fence.  Beyond the fence,
     in the distance, the church looms.

     ANGLE - ERIC

     He pauses.  A KID in a Creature from the Black Lagoon mask
     comes, passes Eric, then comes back for a touch.

                    CREATURE KID
          Trick or treat!

     Eric smiles.  Not tonight.

     EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

     Eric is standing over the grave of Shelly Webster, looking down.
     He holds for a moment then moves on.

     EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT

     Eric ascends toward giant oak doors, tres Gothique.  The crow
     flaps past, leading him.

     NEW ANGLE - TOP OF STEPS -- where waits the Skull Cowboy.  As
     Eric approaches, the Skull Cowboy interposes himself between
     Eric and the huge double doors.

     Eric glares up, defiant.  Moves up the steps.  The Skull Cowboy
     extends a skeletal hand.  STOP.

                    SKULL COWBOY
          Stop screwing around.

     TIGHT ON ERIC

     Angry, ready to battle:  You talking to me?

                    SKULL COWBOY (CONT'D)
          Your job is done.  You interfere
          with the living again.

                    ERIC
          Tell me I'll get hurt.  That I 
          might die.
               (beat)
          I've already done that.  I don't 
          need anyone's help.  Yours 
          included.

     STAIR ANGLE - ERIC AND SKULL COWBOY

     Eric lower, Skull Cowboy superior, the storm wild around them.

                    SKULL COWBOY
          Do this thing and you will be
          vulnerable.  The blood will not
          return.
               (beat)
          No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.

                    ERIC
          Fine with me.

     He ADVANCES a step up; the Skull Cowboy Hold fast.

                    SKULL COWBOY
          You'll be alone.

                    ERIC
          I'm already alone.

     INT. BELL TOWER - NIGHT

     Through a castle keep-like slit, Grange monitors Eric's
     arrival.  He speaks into a headset.

                    GRANGE
          We've got company.

                    LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
          Is he inside?

     GRANGE'S POV - ERIC

     Eric Talking to dead air.  Almost arguing with it.  Eerie.

     RESUME GRANGE

     As he talks into his mike he hefts a nightscoped, laser-sighted
     sniper's rifle.

                    GRANGE
          He's just out front talking to
          himself.  You tell me. 

     EXT. CHURCH - RESUMING ERIC ON STEPS - NIGHT

     Eric, eyes steely, stares down the Skull Cowboy.

                    ERIC
          Don't waste my time.

                    SKULL COWBOY
          Very well, it's your ass.

     And the wind kicks up around them both, powerfully.

     ANGLE - SKULL COWBOY (EFFECT)

     As the force of the storm dust-devils around him and begins to
     disassemble him.  The fire in his eye sockets goes out.  His hat
     flies off an is pulverized by the wind.  The garments begin to
     disintegrate and blow around, rotten cerements falling apart in
     mid-air.

     ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS -- transfixed by this unexpected
     development.  A shard of the Skull Cowboy blows past Eric's face 
     and transmutes to dust!

     RESUME SKULL COWBOY AT TOP OF STEPS (EFFECT)

     Transparent, ancient bones, crumbling and blowing away.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS

     As Eric lunges for what's left of his mysterious, smart-ass
     mentor
     CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S LUNGING HAND

     Meeting only a swirl of vaporous dust where the Skull Cowboy's
     heart would have been.

     TIGHT ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS

     He has time to register the dust in his palm before it, too,
     renders down to nothingness,  leaving a vague green glow that
     dies.  And as he looks to the sky --

     UP ANGLE - THE CROW

     flapping down to land on Eric's shoulder.  Eric is astonished.

                    ERIC
          But why are you still here?

     CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

     No answer in the crow's eyes.

     RESUME AND FOLLOW ERIC

     That's good enough for Eric.  He marches to the double doors and
     shoves them back.

     INT. CHURCH - AS ERIC COMES THROUGH THE DOORS - NIGHT

     The high breeze blows in with him, disturbing dust in the
     disused Gothic dark.  Hollow cathedral ECHOES to sounds.  A
     giant 27" TV positioned on the alter, broadcasting static.

     LONG SHOT - ERIC AS HE APPROACHES THE ALTER - ("CROWVISION")

     Leery of potential danger from a thousand dark places.

     ANGLE - THE TV - AS ERIC ENTERS FRAME

     Onscreen:  Elly, gagged with duct tape and handcuffed to an iron
     ring bolted to a flagstone wall.  Could be anywhere inside the
     church.

                    LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
          I believe our friend Elly call
          you Mister Crow.
               (beat)
          Please acknowledge; the mike
          will pick you up.
          
                    ERIC
          I can see her.

                    LAO
          Of course you can.
     ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE GALLERY --  in darkness.  The running
     lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which
     THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light.

                    LAO (CONT'D; O.S./FILTERED)
          Don't permit your rage to cloud
          the issue.  I believe in barter.
          I propose a simple trade.

     Grange sights his weapon.

     CROSSHAIR POV - ERIC AT THE ALTER

     Bluring as Grange resights.  Eric is not the target.  Blur
     FINDS the crow at the far end of the nave, perched in front of
     a giant stained glass window.

     NEW ANGLE - GRANGE -- squeezing off two quick, SILENCED shots.

     ANGLE - STAINED GLASS WINDOW -- the first shot blows a hole in
     some pastoral religious presentation.  TINKLE of glass.

     ANGLE - ERIC -- Spinning at the quiet !pfut! sound, to witness.

     ANGLE - INCOMING DART - ("CROWVISION")

     SPinning and hissing venomously.

     ANGLE - ERIC DUCKS

     As before, but the crow is not as fast.

     TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW

     As it catches the dart and goes down in a flurry of feathers.

     LOW ANGLE - ERIC AT ALTER - INCLUDE TV

     His knees buckle.  Sympathetic PAIN from the hit.

                    LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
          You intended to finish this
          evening in the cemetery.  I am 
          here to help you on your way.

     ANGLE - RESUMING GRANGE IN GALLERY

     Swapping his tranquilizer gun for a more lethal rifle, similarly 
     scoped.  He sights the fallen Eric in a spray of green light.

     HIGH ANGLE - HAND HELD - ERIC AT ALTER

     Groping for support to drag himself back to standing.

                    GRANGE (O.S.)
          I've got him if you want him.

                    LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
          No shooting.

                    GRANGE
               (into headset)
          Move in, guys.

     HIGH ANGLE - THE SANCTUARY -- as Lao Guards #3 and #4 move
     into light, closing on Eric's position in the center of isle.
     Both wield calico's and one bears a sword.

     CLOSE ANGLE - ALTER -- Lao makes his entrance from shadow
     wearing a brisk pugilist get-up, a practical fighting outfit.
     Makes a show of drawing the killing blade.

                    LAO
          I wish to possess what you have now.

                    ERIC
          I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.

                    LAO
          I know.  That is why I will
          prevail.  Mr. Grange... ?

     Eric CRAMPS UP, CLUTCHING his throat in obvious pain.

     ANGLE - GRANGE AT STAINED GLASS WINDOW

     Holding the crow by the neck, TIGHTLY.  He plucks the tranq dart
     from the its body.

     ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AS LAO MOVES IN CLOSER

     Crashing to one knee, invisibly bludgeoned, struggling to
     breathe.  Lao has no fear, walking around the stricken Eric.

                    LAO
          Sooner or later, my action were
          destined to bring me a genuine
          Fury.  And it turned out to be you.
          At last.  I appreciate your
          abilities as few mortals can.
          That's why I desire them.

                    ERIC
          You're too late.  There was a guy
          outside - on the stairs - you
          really need to talk to.  But he 
          turned to dust and blew away.
               (beat, gasping)
          I don't have any power for you to take.

                    LAO
          I don't believe that.
     Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade.  Grange RELAXES
     his deathgrip on the crow.  MOVE IN CLOSE on Eric so we may
     perceive a palpable degree of relief.

                    LAO (CONT'D)
          Time for you to die for me.
                (beat)
          Funny, how the dead can still
          bleed.  How they need air.

     Eric IMMOBILIZED as Lao DRAWS BACK the Blade.  To Grange:

                    LAO (CONT'D)
          Break its neck.

     ANGLE - RESUMING GRANGE AT WINDOW as he prepares to do dirty on
     the bird.

     Over his shoulder, we PUSH in to the BULLETHOLE from the first
     dart until we're in TIGHT CLOSE-UP of an eye watching through 
     the hole.

     EXT. CHURCH - OBVERSE OF WINDOW - NIGHT

     Albrecht digs through a sling bag of weaponry, trying to
     simultaneously monitor the peephole, muttering sotto to
     himself.

                    ALBRECHT
          Had to go get yourself hip-deep in
          shit, didn't you, my friend.

     It begins to rain.  Albrecht glances resentfully toward the 
     sky.

                    ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
          Give it a rest, huh?

     A hefts a machinegun, clipped over and under.  CUTS LOOSE on
     full auto into the Madonna on the window.

     INT.  CHURCH NAVE - NIGHT

     As the window EXPLODES toward Grange and he sucks big hits from
     behind, DROPPING the crow.  The bird hits the ground, flapping
     weakly.

     LAO GUARDS #3 & #4 exchange a look and whip up their Calicos,
     RETURNING FIRE.

     EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT

     Albrecht takes cover as a lot of religious stuff is noisily
     destroyed all around his position.  Chunks of the window
     continue to disintegrate. 

     INT. CHURCH ALTER (NIGHT)

     Eric tuck-and-rolls out of the way as we go CLOSE on Lao, 
     screaming.

                    LAO
          I said no shooting!

     Then he's ducking bullets himself as Albrecht STEPS IN through
     the blown out window, the machine gun stuttering on slugs.

     The sanctuary comes apart around Lao.  He RETREATS to the alter
     and EXITS whence he came.

     TIGHT ON PEW -- ERIC DIVES just as Guard #4 comes after him with
     the sword, which chomps into the wood and gets stuck there.
     Guard #4 releases it and cross draws his Calico as ERIC springs
     back into the frame -- STRAIGHT UP.

     TIGHT ON GUARD #4 as Eric's lancing foot propels him backward
     before he can fire.

     INTERCUTS -- ALBRECHT AND GUARD #3 scrambling to reload.  Guard
     changes magazine; Albrecht swaps clips.

     ANGLE - DOWN LENGTH OF PEW -- Guard #4 slides.  Sits up with his 
     gun as Eric, down-pew, grabs the sword.

     ANGLE - ALBRECHT AT WINDOW  firing now with a gun in each hand.

     RESUME ERIC AND GUARD #4, who eats it from Albrecht's gunfire,
     but not before he puts a round through Eric.

     Eric staggers back from the impact but keeps his feet.  

     RESUME ALBRECHT as he tosses away the dry pistol.  His machine
     gun jams, he fights to get the clip.

     ANGLE - GUARD #3 -- reloaded and rising, having caught Albrecht
     dead-bang in the open by the window.

     MOVING ANGLE - WITH ERIC --  A complex leap with the sword
     flashing.  He lands near Guard #3 and SLASHES UPWARDS, blade up.

     CLOSE-UP - GUARD #3 -- screaming in pain, gaping DOWN O.S.

     TIGHT ON ALBRECHT - looking UP, following the trajectory of
     something AIRBORNE toward him.

     CLOSE-UP - GUARD #3'S Calico spinning mid-air with Guard #3s
     HANDS still attached, severed mid-forearm by Eric's devastating
     strike.

     ANGLE - ALBRECHT drops Guard #3 -- to REVEAL Eric in the
     background.  Eric salutes Albrecht with the tip of the sword.

     WITH ALBRECHT as he moves into the nave, which has been torn
     apart by gunfire.  Hazy smoke.  Two dead guys.  And Eric.

                    ALBRECHT
          You sorta looked like you might
          need my help.

                    ERIC
          This isn't your place.  This isn't
          your fight.  And I don't need
          your help.

                    ALBRECHT
          You're welcome.

                    ERIC
          Leave here.  Don't do this.  I
          don't want you here.

                    ALBRECHT
          The hell you say.  This isn't just 
          about you any more.

     Eric stares dead-on at Albrecht, acidly, then BREAKS the Guard's 
     sword, dropping the pieces and turning his back on Albrecht, who
     pursues Eric to: 

     INT. SPIRAL STAIRCASE - TO BELL TOWER - NIGHT

     The crow FLAPS UPWARD through the void.  Eric grabs the thick
     bellrope, testing it.  A final look to Albrecht.

                    ERIC
          Don't interfere.

                    ALBRECHT
          You're bleeding, man.  You can't
          make it.

     Eric shinnies up the bellrope, ignoring Albrecht.

     ON ALBRECHT

     Watching as Eric dissappears from view, fast..  Grumbles.

                    ALBRECHT
          You won't mind if I just take the
          stairs, then, smartass...

     He hefts his arsenal bag of hardware and begins to plod up the
     steps.

     ANGLE - MOVING WITH ERIC ON THE ROPE -- A weird perspective of
     speed climb.  Zip!  All the way to the top.

     EXT - CHURCH ROOF - NIGHT

     Slanted, shingled, slippery, dark.  Lightning deep in the turbid
     clouds.  The crow circles as Eric RISES INTO FRAME.

                    ERIC
          Here I am.

     DOWNFRAME lightning STRIKES the ornate LIGHTNING ROD (large,
     Victorian, lance-like) at the far end of the roof from the bell
     tower.

     SILHOUETTING Lao and Elly standing in front of it.  Elly
     flinches at the strike.

                    LAO
          Can you fly, Crow man?

     INT. BELLTOWER SPIRAL STAIRS - RESUMING ALBRECHT

     He stops his ascent to light a cigarette.

                    ALBRECHT
          I ain't cut out for this superhero
          shit.

     EXT. CHURCH ROOF - RESUMING LAO - NIGHT

     Lao SNAPS Elly's free handcuff to the dimly glowing  lightning
     rod and advances, one foot on either side of the peak of the
     roof, his blade brandished.

     CLOSE MOVING SHOT - ERIC -- Hands up to grapple, but
     weaponless.  He spiders to meet Lao, suddenly PICKING UP SPEED
     and RUNNING along the precarious peak.

     Lao sees him coming, braces to strike, but Eric executes a BROAD
     FLYING LEAP right over Lao's head.

     ERIC LANDS, SLIPS, sprawls sideways, clinging to the peak of the
     roof.  Lao hurries in to slash with the blade, as Eric averts.
     The steel RINGS.  Eric converts his dodge into a low spin kick
     that DUMPS Lao.

     Eric SPREAD-EAGLES to keep from falling.  Distantly, Lao
     similarly saves himself.

     NEW ANGLE -- THE FIGHT -- Here comes Lao, crabbing back toward
     the peak.  Eric ROLLS to Elly's position, GRABS the lightning
     rod and tries to wrest it loose.

     SIZZLE OF FLESH as Eric's hands are scorched: the metal is still
     blue-hot.

     MOVING WITH LAO as Eric battles to free the lightning rod.  Lao
     closes up distance, gives a warcry and prepares to swing as - 

     Eric WRENCHES the rod loose and turns to deflect Lao's blow.
     The weapons spark as they meet... and there goes Elly, her
     handcuff freed, SLIDING DOWN THE ROOF SLOPE.

     ANGLE  -- ROOF SLOPE -- WITH ERIC  as he dodges Lao by using the
     lightning rod to vault down to where Elly is about to slip off
     the roof.

     With the rod embedded in the roof, Eric hangs on, and elly hangs 
     on to Eric.

     UP ANGLE -- LAO, a dark figure against the night sky, raising
     the sword.

                    LAO
          Face me!

     Eric guides Elly to the top of one of the flying buttresses.
     When he looks up, Lao is gone.

     ANGLE - BELL TOWER -- Albrecht's head pokes up at last.  Looks
     around, finally spots Eric below and to the left.  YELLS, serio-comic.

                    ALBRECHT
          Is he dead yet?

     INSERT - ALBRECHT'S HOLSTER as Lao's hand draws Albrecht's
     gun quickly.

     ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND LAO --Lao has blindsided Albrecht.

                    LAO
          No.  You are.

     He jams the gun into the base of ALbrecht's neck and fires three times.

     CLOSE ANGLE - ERIC - He's too far away to matter.  Shock.

     INSERT - ALBRECHT'S CIGARETTE as it rolls down the slope,
     trailing sparks, snuffing out.

     ANGLE - ERIC holding onto the lightning rod as lightning CUTS the
     night above him.

     ANGLE -- LAO AT BELL TOWER, triumphant and a bit wild, SHOUTING.
                    LAO
          You've caused another death,
          Mister Draven!  The girl will die
          as well -- because of you!

     ANGLE - ELLY ON FLYING BUTTRESS

     The base of a triangle - Lao, Eric, Elly.

                    ELLY
          You go to hell, you pervert!

     RESUME ERIC

     Rage over the loss of Albrecht.  He RISES, hurting but mad as
     hell.  GLARES UP toward Lao.

                    ERIC
          And how many lives have you destroyed?

                    LAO
          I took yours from you.  Your
          little girlfriend?  I took hers,
          too.  Your meaningless, petty
          life?  I took it so that tonight
          your existence might gain a
          purpose.  You're no avenger.
          You're mine.

     PUSH IN TIGHT ON ERIC.

     Eyes alight with hatred for Lao.

                    ERIC
                (to himself)
          You're right, I'm not an avenger. 
          Not any more.

     As lightning strikes, Eric Fires his gaze TOWARD THE SKY.

     HIGH ANGLE - LAO ON ROOFTOP - ("CROWVISION")

     SEEING the crash dive toward Lao through the row's eyes.

     ANGLE  - LAO ON ROOFTOP

     As the crow wings down INTO FRAME and lights on Lao's head, CLAWING!

     CLOSE-UP -- THE CROW ON LAO'S HEAD slashing with its claws.
     Pecking out Lao's eyes.

     WITH ERIC -- on the roofslope as he totters but maintains his
     climb, the crow/Lao UPFRAME B.G.

     RESUME LAO -- as the crow abandons him.  Lao STAGGERS AND FALLS
     down the roof - toward Eric.
     SLANTED ANGLE -- ERIC AND LAO -- Eric ARRESTS Lao's fall,
     fisting lapels and bringing him nose to nose.  Fury.

                    ERIC
          Time for a sacrifice.

     Lao's face is a hideous bloody mask with black holes where the
     eyes used to be.  He smiles gruesomely.

                    LAO
          I don't need eyes to take what I
          want from you.

     He EMBRACES Eric and RAMS the killing blade deep into Eric's
     back!

     ON ERIC as he looks down to see the blade protruding from his
     sternum.  Tight grimace.  A lot of pain.

                    ERIC
          Can you fly?

     He pulls Lao into a BACKWARD ROLL down the roof, HOLDING HIM
     TIGHT.

     MOVING ANGLE -- INTERCUTS -- ERIC AND LAO FALL

     Eric lands on his back, forcing the blade THROUGH himself and
     INTO Lao.  Eric completes the roll and KICKS Lao off INTO SPACE,
     the killing blade still embedded in him!

     WITH LAO as crashes, sliding, sprawling down PAST Elly's
     position.  Gets to his knees atop the flying buttress.  Sees the
     blade in his own chest.

     CLOSE-UP - ELLY - she sees it all happen.

     RESUME LAO - a regretful look toward Eric.  He PLUMMETS off the 
     roof edge.

     ANGLE - ERIC SLIDES DOWN ROOF --  He slows, stopping when Elly
     is in frame.  He clutches his own chest.  Regards his own
     shaking hand, drenched in his won blood.  Glazed.

     ON ELLY, as she finally gets the duct tape off her mouth, trying
     to get to Eric.  She flails and cries out.

                    ELLY
          Don't let me fall!

     CLOSE-UP -- their hands finally meet and GRASP TIGHT.

     EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT (LATER) (RAIN)

     A low angle TRACKING SHOT (as when we first met Elly).

     Eric's and Elly's feet pass graves.  Eric's pace is slow, crippled, 
     limping.  They STOP at a grave where elly BENDS INTO FRAME to steal 
     the flowers there.

     Eric is bloody and out of it.  She helps him walk.

                    ELLY
          Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.

                    ERIC
          In a better place.  I hope.

                    ELLY
          You're not gonna come back, are you?

     Eric's response is halting and uncertain.  But he tries to give
     her hope.  He reaches for Shelly's ring around her neck, holds
     it up to her.

                    ERIC
          I don't know if I can.  But you
          have this... and you know where to come.

                    ELLY
          You mean you'll, like' dig your way
          out of the grave?  Euww.

     Eric is amused by this in spite of his grievous injuries.

     He grasps Elly's face in his hands and bends, painfully,to kiss
     her on the forehead.

                    ERIC
          For you, I'll try.  Promise.

     MOVE WITH ERIC

     Spent, empty, he holds the rose determinedly, but he's never
     going to make it the few yards back to his own grave.  So close.

     His legs finally go and he collapses onto the humus.  One
     groping hand tries to drag him further.

                    ERIC
          Leave me now.

     ANGLE - ELLY

     Tears on her face.  She can't watch this.  She TURNS and drops
     the flowers on Shelly's grave.

     ERIC'S POV - HIS OWN GRAVE

     Still too far away to matter.

     RESUME ERIC ON GROUND

     He gives it up, his face sinking into the wet grass for a beat
     before SHELLY'S HAND intrudes INTO FRAME to GRASP his hand.

     No ethereal glow, no heavenly choir... just a near-dead Eric's
     blank-faced astonishment, and he moves forward.

     ANGLE - ELLY - SHELLY'S GRAVE BG

     She struggles to get her hood up against the rain and roughly
     wipes the moisture from her face with her sleeve.  She turns
     toward Eric's grave.  Then, surprised, she looks close.

     ANGLE - ERIC'S GRAVE

     Eric is gone.  The white rose lies neatly on the top of the
     undisturbed  earth there.

     HIGH ANGLE - CEMETERY

     Emphasizing that Elly is now ALONE in the graveyard.

     LOW ANGLE on Elly, ROSE in the foreground --

     She walks OFF.  HOLD the rose.

                                   CUT TO:

     INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAY (OVERCAST)

     A grey day but no rain.  Elly stands wistfully by the window,
     her doll on standby.  The apartment is in order and perhaps we
     notice a few new items.  Gabriel the cat, miraculously ALIVE, is
     sprawled on a chair, licking himself.  Darla BUSTLES INTO FRAME
     B.G.  Her wardrobe more upscale, her hair done.  Her manner is
     hectic but natural.

                    DARLA
          Worktime, kiddo.  First day, new
          job, gotta go.

     This does not get the expected smile from Elly.

                    DARLA (CONT'D)
          You sure you're gonna be okay?

     Elly turns from the window and NODS silently.

     ELLY'S POV - OUTSIDE

     The aforementioned grey day in the city.

     ANGLE - DARLA AND ELLY AT THE WINDOW.

     Darla comes up.  Arm around Elly.  Cheer up; he attitude much
     more connected and loving.  PUSH IN ON ELLY so we know she is
     clutching SHelly's ring tightly in her hand.  Darla looks past
     Elly, out the window.

                    DARLA
          At least it finally stopped
          raining.

                    ELLY
          It can't rain all the time.

     Darla kisses Elly on the temple and it out the door.  Elly OPENS
     her hand to consider the ring.  She looks back out the window --

     ANGLE - THE CROW ON THE LEDGE

     Elly is looking right at it.  Same crow.  We're positive.  So is
     Elly.  It TAKES WING and flies away.

     EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

     An UP ANGLE from Eric's grave toward the tree as the crow FLIES
     INTO FRAME and perches there, shucking water.  PUSH IN on the
     crow.  Watching.  Waiting.

                                   SLOW FADE TO DEAD BLACK. 

                                   THE END
