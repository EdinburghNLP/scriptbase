          CLOSE ON A PAGE OF A LARA CROFT COMIC BOOK
                         
          Being copied, with uncanny precision, down to the last
          detail, by a ten year old hand clutching a pencil.

           Cataleya!
                         
          The page of a notebook turns, revealing neat cursive
          handwriting, covers the comic.

          CATALEYA RESTREPO, CAT for short, a contained, very
          centered 10 year old, pretty, but with a toughness, sitting
          at the dining room table, in a well kept, but modest home,
          with windows that look out over the steep hillside favela,
          attends to her notebook.
                         
          On the window there are half a dozen beautiful orchid
          plants. The rare Cataleya orchid. All around there are
          packed cartons, suitcases. Moving day is at hand.
                         
                          MOTHER
           Cat! Is your homework finished
           yet?
                         
                          CAT
           Working on it Mama.
                         
          Her mother, taking time off from packing, comes over to
          Cat, and turns the page of the notebook to reveal the Lara
          Croft comic and it's copy.
                         
                          MOTHER
           You draw beautifully my love, but
           if you want to be something in
           life you have to study.
                         
                          CAT
           I am studying Mama. I want to be
           a super hero.
                         
          Her mother turns the page back to the lessons.
                         
                          MOTHER
           Better to be a doctor. A lawyer.
                         
                          CAT
           Are we going to see Uncle Emilio?
           2.
                         
                          MOTHER
           I don't know. Just waiting to
           hear from your father.
                         
          Cat looks up at a picture on the wall of the family. Cat,
          her mother, and her father. Her face carries a bit of
          worry.

                          DON LUIS
           I can't believe this.
                         
          Mid 40'S, a gentleman, calm, courteous, impeccably dressed.

          At a table, with bottle of liquor and two glasses, Don
          Luis sits opposite...
                         
                          FABIO
           Why not?
                         
          Cat's father. Off to the side, Don Luis's right hand man,
          MARCO, stands like any right hand, unobtrusive.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           Because I love you Fabio. Like a
           brother.
                         
                          FABIO
           And I love you Don Luis. Like a
           brother.
                         
          He turns to Marco.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           Can you believe this guy Marco?
           We started when we were little...how
           old were we Fabio?
                         
                          FABIO
           Ten.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           Ten year old bastards stealing
           apples from the carts in the market.
           After all we've been through.
           And now we're on top, he wants to
           leave...
                         
                          FABIO
           Luis, I'm going to be honest with
           you. You remember I had that
           operation?
           3.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           That was last year.
                         
                          FABIO
           Since then, I'm not a hundred
           percent. And you can't do this
           thing if you're not a hundred
           percent. I'm tired.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           So you'll take a rest.
                         
                          FABIO
           You know how many times we should
           have been dead?
                         
                          DON LUIS
           I don't even want to count.
                         
                          FABIO
           Neither do I. But you gotta think.
           How lucky we are to still be alive.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           Yeah. That's right. We're alive.
           And what about the future of this
           thing we built?
                         
                          FABIO
           It's yours. It's not my thing any
           more.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           I'm not going to talk you out of
           it, am I cabron?
                         
                          FABIO
           I'll always be there for you Luis.
           Just pick up the phone, I'm there.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           I'm gonna hold you to that. You
           bastard.
                          (EMOTIONAL)
           I'm going to miss you.
                         
                          FABIO
           And I'm going to miss you.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           OK. Enough of this sentimental
           bullshit. Next we'll be crying
           like two old women. Come on! One
           last drink, huh?
                         
          He pours the liquor into the glasses.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           To the future.
           4.
                         
          They tap glasses.
                         
                          FABIO
           Bueno.
                         
          They shoot the liquor down. Fabio rises.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           So. Business is all clear?
                         
                          FABIO
           All clear.
                         
          He hands Don Luis a computer disc.
                         
                          FABIO
           It's all here.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           No other copies?
                         
                          FABIO
           You even have to ask?
                         
                          DON LUIS
           Hey.
                         
          He shrugs. Opens his arms. The two men embrace. Close
          as brothers.
                         
                          FABIO
           Adios Marco. Make sure he doesn't
           get in too much trouble.
                         
                          MARCO
           Adios Don Fabio. I'll do my best.
                         
          And with that, Fabio exits the garden. Don Luis watches
          him, sad to see his friend go. Sighs deeply, pours himself
          a whiskey, downs it, turns to Marco.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           Kill this motherfucker.
                         
          INT. CAR - DAY
                         
          Two men, holding automatics in their laps sit in the back,
          the driver in the front. They see Fabio very contained,
          calm, walking towards them. The driver turns the engine
          on. Fabio slips into the passenger seat. The car takes
          off.
                         
          Fabio explodes. Smashes the dashboard. Over and over.
                         
                          FABIO
           This fucker! The motherfucker!
                         
          He keeps banging the dash.
           5.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Not OK Boss?
                         
                          FABIO
           This bastard thinks I'm an idiot.
           Playing it all mellow and shit.
           If he would have yelled and screamed
           and threatened to kill my whole
           family, it would have been OK. We
           have an hour to get out of here.
           At most.
                         
          Off the nervous looks of the guys in the car...
                         
          EXT. CAT'S HOME - DAY
                         
          Fabio's car comes to a screeching halt. Fabio exits to
          three other gunmen, nervous, on edge. The gunmen from the
          car take defensive positions. Fabio runs up the stairs.
                         
          INT. CAT'S HOME - DAY
                         
          Cat is still at the table drawing, when she hears the
          screeching of tires, the fast footsteps outside. She senses
          a storm coming. Fabio bursts in. His wife sees his tension
          filled face.
                         
                          MOTHER
           Fabio?
                         
                          FABIO
           We've got ten minutes.
                         
                          MOTHER
                          (PANICKED)
           Cataleya, go pack!
                         
                          CAT
           I'm packed Mama.
                         
          Cat is strangely calm, just sits at the table. Watches as
          Fabio takes the family picture off the wall, pries the
          frame back, extracts a small chip hidden inside the frame,
          comes over to Cat.
                         
                          FABIO
           Listen to me my darling. Just in
           case of anything. This...
                         
          He holds the chip up.
                         
                          FABIO
           This is your passport. Do you
           understand?
                         
          She nods. He places the chip in her hand, takes a card
          out of his pocket.
           6.
                         
                          FABIO
           You find yourself alone? You go
           to the address on this card. Show
           it to the man at the front gate.
                         
                          CAT
           I don't understand papa.
                         
                          FABIO
           You don't have to understand. You
           just have to listen, and remember.
                         
          As Cat looks at the chip.
                         
          EXT. CAT'S HOME - DAY
                         
          As Fabio's men keep a sharp lookout, two SUV's come rolling
          down the street. Their fingers work the triggers of their
          weapons. The two SUV's roll up. The blacked out windows
          roll down.
                         
                          MAN
           (polite. smiling)
           Hola. We want to see Don Fabio.
                         
                          BODYGUARD
           He's not home.
                         
                          MAN
           You mind if we wait?
                         
                          BODYGUARD
           Your time.
                         
          INT. CAT'S HOME - DAY
                         
          Fabio writes on top of Cat's drawing, rips the page off,
          folds it, puts it in her pocket, removes a medal from around
          his neck, drapes it over hers.
                         
                          FABIO
           And this will keep you safe.
                         
          Cat looks down at the medal.
                         
          CLOSE ON THE MEDAL
                         
          An imprint of a flower.
                         
                          FABIO
           The Cataleya orchid. It comes
           from one place on Earth. Our place.
           My mother, your grandmother, used
           to grow them. Every morning I
           would wake up to the sight of them.
           The smell of them. That's why I
           named you after them. It reminds
           us of who we are.
           7.
                         
          He kisses her on the forehead. His wife appears at the
          doorway with two suitcases.
                         
                          MOTHER
           I'm ready.
                         
          EXT. CAT'S HOME - DAY
                         
          The man in the SUV is on the phone.
                         
                          MAN
           They said he's not home yet.
                         
          He listens.
                         
                          MAN
           OK. OK.
                         
          He hangs up. Puts his phone back in his pocket. Walks up
          to Fabio's men.
                         
                          MAN
           Change of plans.
                         
          He pulls out his gun, shoots them point blank.
                         
          INT. CAT'S HOME - DAY
                         
          As they are exiting the house through a rear door, the
          shots ring out. They see another black SUV rushing up the
          street.
                         
                          FABIO
           Back!
                         
          He pushes his family back inside. Fabio runs to the window.
          Sees his men on the losing end of a gun battle. As the
          men fall, and others run up the stairs firing as they
          retreat toward the front door...
                         
                          FABIO
           Too late. Get ready!
                         
          The Mother drops the suitcases and runs to the rear room.
          Fabio comes over to the unnaturally calm Cat.
                         
                          FABIO
           I love you very much.
                         
                          CAT
           I love you too Papa.
                         
          CLOSE ON FABIO'S HAND
                         
          Reaches under the table where Cat is sitting, takes a gun
          strapped there. Next to the gun is a big knife.
                         
          And then footsteps, coming fast outside, draw his attention.
           8.
                         
                          FABIO
           Alicia!
                         
          His wife runs into the room toting two big assed assault
          rifles. She tosses one to Fabio. Both of them take up
          shooter's positions facing the door.
                         
          ANGLE ON CAT
                         
          Sitting at the table, very still. Watching.
                         
          ANGLE ON HER MOTHER AND FATHER
                         
          Facing the front door, hands gripping their assault rifles,
          sweat dripping down their faces, chests heaving, waiting,
          waiting, to blow anyone who comes through the door to
          kingdom come.
                         
          But they never get the chance because...
                         
          BBBBRRRRAAAAKKKKKK!!!!!!!!
                         
          Machine gun fire shatters the windows on both sides of the
          room, tearing into their bodies before they even get one
          shot off. Tearing the orchid plants there to shred.
                         
          Cat watches in mute disbelief, shocked, as her parents
          bodies are riddled with heavy caliber rounds making them
          twitch and dance like marionettes on wires. Their blood
          splattering across the room, across her.
                         
          And then...
                         
          Silence. Silence so complete it is deafening in it's
          absence of any sound. Cat just sits in her chair.
                         
          And then the door bursts open and four gunmen storm into
          the room, their assault weapons trained on the only living
          thing in the room.
                         
          Cat. Marco enters.
                         
                          MARCO
           You in the kitchen. You, the
           bedroom. You, the back.
                         
          The gunmen scatter. Marco has his inquisitive eye on Cat,
          who does not drop her eyes, impossible to read.
                         
          One of the GUNMAN strides over to Cat, jams a gun to her
          head. Cat does not move a muscle. Does not blink.
                         
          ANGLE ON MARCO
                         
          Examines the frame Fabio dug the chip out of.
                         
          ANGLE ON THE GUNMAN WITH THE GUN TO CAT'S HEAD
                         
          He chambers a round, is about to pull the trigger...
           9.
                         
                          MARCO
           Hey! What are you doing?
                         
          As the other gunmen begin to tear the house apart, looking
          for something, Marco strides over to Cat. The frame in
          his hand.
                         
                          GUNMAN
           Don Luis said kill everyone.
                         
                          MARCO
           He also said no names.
                         
                          GUNMAN
           She won't remember.
                         
          He is about to pull the trigger.
                         
                          MARCO
           HEY!
                         
          The gunman stops.
                         
                          MARCO
           She's a kid.
                         
                          GUNMAN
           So what?
                         
                          MARCO
           What do you mean so what? You
           take a kid, teach them, they have
           value.
                         
          The gunman takes his gun, lifts Cat's lip, looks at her
          teeth.
                         
                          GUNMAN
           I couldn't even get ten bucks for
           her in the street.
                         
          The gunman is about to pull the trigger again.
                         
                          MARCO
           Are you stupid or what? Here.
                         
          Marco hands him some cash.
                         
                          MARCO
           Here's twenty asshole. Go do your
           job.
                         
          Scowling, the gunman joins the others in ripping the house
          apart, looking for something.
                         
          Marco calmly goes to the fridge, takes out two bottles of
          water, cracks the caps, sets one down on front of Cat as
          he sits opposite her. Her hands are in her lap.
           10.
                         
                          MARCO
                          (SOFTLY)
           Remember me Cataleya?
                         
          Cat shakes her head no.
                         
                          MARCO
           I was at your confirmation. My
           name is Marco, and I was a very
           good friend of your father. I see
           he gave you his medal.
                         
          Alluding to the medal around her neck.
                         
                          MARCO
           The Cataleya orchid. His symbol.
           Your name. That's good. This way
           you will always remember him.
                          (BEAT)
           I know this is a terrible thing
           for you to have seen.
                         
          All the while his men are searching, frisking the bodies
          of the dead, even tearing the heels off their shoes.
                         
                          MARCO
           Some things are too complicated
           for a kid to understand. This is
           one of them. But I am going to
           try explain it and make it very
           simple for you. So you understand.
           Now, you know who Don Luis is?
                         
          Cat responds, shakes her head yes. Her hand slips
          imperceptibly under the table.
                         
          CLOSE ON HER HAND
                         
          Touches the handle of the knife taped there.
                         
                          MARCO
           Of course you do. He was your
           father's best friend since they're
           kids. He's like an Uncle to you.
           You know he has always been good
           to your family, don't you?
                         
          Again Cat shakes her head.
                         
                          MARCO
           This house, the food you eat, the
           clothes you wear. Even your school
           fees. All this comes from Don
           Luis. You know that?
                         
          Again Cat shakes her head.
           11.
                         
                          MARCO
           But when someone is good to you
           and you are not good to them back,
           then bad things happen. Things
           like...
                         
          He alludes to the riddled bodies of her dead parents.
                         
                          MARCO
           This.
                         
          Cat looks from the bodies and back to Marco, no emotion in
          her eyes.
                         
                          MARCO
           I know you are a smart girl. You
           do well in school. So I know this
           is not too complicated for you to
           understand. Am I right?
                         
          Cat nods.
                         
                          MARCO
           Good. Now, your father had
           something that belonged to Don
           Luis. A little thing. No bigger
           than...
                         
          He holds up his thumbnail.
                         
                          MARCO
           This. Maybe it was in this.
                         
          He holds up the frame, shows where the chip was dug out of
          the wood.
                         
                          MARCO
           Do you know what I am talking about?
                         
          Cat nods.
                         
          CLOSE ON CAT'S HAND
                         
          Gripping the knife handle.
                         
                          MARCO
           Excellent. Do you know where it
           is?
                         
          Cat nods.
                         
                          MARCO
           Well, if you give it to me, Don
           Luis will be very grateful. And
           very generous. He will make sure
           that you are clothed, fed, and
           sent to the very best school. You
           will have everything you want.
                          (MORE)
           12.
                         
                          MARCO (CONT'D)
           But if you don't give it to him,
           he will be very unhappy. And you
           see what happens when he is not
           happy, yes?
                         
          Cat nods yes.
                         
                          MARCO
           So why don't you just give that
           little thing which belongs to him.
           Will you do that?
                         
          Cat hesitates for a moment, and then removes one hand from
          underneath the table, her fist closed tight. Marco smiles,
          kindly. He holds out his hand.
                         
                          MARCO
           You are a smart girl.
                         
          Marco opens his hand.
                         
                          MARCO
           And in this life, smart girls get
           everything they want. What do you
           want Cat?
                         
          And just as she is about to open her hand...
                         
          CLOSE ON HER OTHER HAND
                         
          Under the table, gripping the handle of the knife taped
          there.
                         
                          MARCO
           Just tell me sweetheart...what do
           you want?
                         
          In a flash, the knife is whipped out and buried into Marco's
          unsuspecting, open palm. Driven with such force, the knife
          pierces through the back of his hand, and sticks into the
          table beneath; pinning his hand. Marco wants to scream
          but there is so much pain, nothing escapes his throat.
                         
                          CAT
           (in his ear)
           To kill Don Luis!
                         
                          MARCO

          As she runs through the rooms of the house, sprints to the
          bathroom where one foot hits the toilet, springing her
          onto the ledge of a very small window. As she looks back,
          she sees the gunmen in hot pursuit. And she jumps, head
          first. Barely squeezing her small frame through the tiny
          window.
                         
          And she drops...
                         
          Six feet down, onto a ledge, that is just beneath the
          window. She flattens against the wall, holding onto the
          medal of her father.
                         
          ON THE BATHROOM
                         
          One of the gunman comes to the window, cannot fit through,
          looks out, does not see anybody across, then hears something
          beneath him, looks down, sees the tip of a shoe below.
          Puts his gun out the window, points it down, and....
                         
          BBBBRRRRAAAAKKKKKKK!!!!!!

          feet. Coming inches from ripping into them. And then the
          barrage stops.

          She hears the pause. Looks out over the sprawl of houses
          that stretch up and down the steep hillsides of the favela.
          She looks down at her open palm at the small chip her father
          gave her. Pops the chip in her mouth, swallows, leaps
          over the small divide between her house and the next roof,
          and takes off running.
                         
          ON THE GUNMAN
                         
          Gets the clip to fit, sees Cat heading off across the roof,
          out in the open, exposed, vulnerable. He lifts his gun to
          shoot, when the gun muzzle is slammed up, peppers the
          ceiling with bullets. The gunman turns to Marco, holding
          his bloody rag wrapped hand.

          motorcycles. The souped up rice rockets take off in four
          different directions.

          As she comes off the last rooftop, down into a small alley.
          She sprints across to a small door. She kicks at the door,
          which gives way and enters...
                         
          AN OPEN COURTYARD
                         
          Where a half dozen women are doing laundry by an open tap.
          They look up to the sight of this little girl in the blood
          splattered school uniform, do not say a word. And neither
          does Cat. She just runs through to a small gate on the
          far side of the courtyard, opens it, and disappears. One
          of the women casually hangs one of her wet sheets over the
          gate, hiding it.

          They crash through the vegetable garden. The old man deftly
          kicks a rake leaning against the wall. It falls in between
          the rows of tomato vines.
                         
          When the gunmen sprint through, the first one trips over
          the rake, goes crashing through the vines, which causes
          the two men behind him to also trip and fall. The fourth
          man hurdles his fallen cohorts, bounds over the roof.
                         
          And the fifth man, looks at the old man. Knows what he
          has done. Shoots him dead before jumping off the roof.

          They enter the laundry yard. The women don't even look
          up. The gunmen look around, just see laundry hanging from
          the fence, do not see the hidden door. Race back out.

          She runs down a steep alley, filled with people sitting
          outside their homes, chatting, playing dominoes.
                         
          At the end of the alley, two motorcycles appear. The riders
          see Cat, as she sees them. They turn their bikes into the
          alley...
                         
          VRROOOM!
                         
          And bear down on Cat.
                         
          Cat sprints back up the hill. She goes to escape into one
          of the open doors, but she finds that one after another
          the doors have closed shut, the people fled inside.
                         
          The bikes eat up the hill. Cat's legs are no match for
          them. It seems she will be caught any second. She ducks
          down a street where laundry is hung on a concealed metal
          pipe running the length of the alley. As Cat ducks through
          the sheets the gunmen gun their bikes right towards her,
          tear through the sheets...
                         
          AND THE CONCEALED METAL PIPE CATCHES THEM ACROSS THEIR
          THROATS.

          AND JUST AS SHE DOES...
                         
          Marco, in an open top jeep, with three of his gunmen ON

          The doors and windows all along the street are shuttered
          tight. Her eyes search the curb as she makes her way down

          In total disbelief, watching her disappear down the narrow
          slit in the curb.
                         
          Both jeeps pull up. The men jump out. Marco flattens to
          the street, peers into the grate, sees Cat staring up at
          him.
                         
          Marco takes his gun out. Jams it in the grate...
                         
          BAMBAMBAMBAMBAM!!!!
                         
          Empties his clip into the dark. When he runs out of ammo,
          he peers down again.
                         
          Cat is gone. The gunmen run to the next sewer grate fire
          into that one. Marco looks down, no Cat.
                         
                          MARCO
           Get down there!
                         
          The gunmen rip the grate out, jump down the hole.

          INT. SEWERS - DAY
                         
          The gunmen, following the beams of their flashlights, go
          tramping through the muck of the sewers, trying to find
          Cat. The only living things they find are rats, scurrying
          across their feet.
                         
                          GUNMAN

           MARCO V.O.
           Come back out.
                         
          The gunmen retreat back the way they came. They do not
          see someone watching them go.
                         
                         ANGLE ON
                         
          A small crevice in the sewer wall. Cat has squeezed herself
          into the crack, almost invisible.

          A hand emerges. And then, Cat pulls herself out, into the
          street.
                         
          PULL BACK TO CAT RISING
                         
          She stands at the edge of the busy thoroughfare, and looks
          around. She is in the heart of the city. Where tall office
          buildings, compete with graceful, classical mansions. In
          the distance, she sees the hillsides, covered with the
          twinkling lights of the favelas, two miles, and a world
          away.

          Two Marines stand guard. Looking straight ahead.

           20.
                         
          The Marine looks down to Cat. Bedraggled, covered in soot
          and blood and shit. Holding out the card her father gave
          her.

          The American looks at the card Cat gave to the Marine,
          hands it to another American.
                         
                          AMERICAN 1
           And you say you have something for
           us?
                         
          He turns to Cat, who nods yes.
                         
                          AMERICAN 1
           May I see it?
                         
          Cat takes a beat. Puts her fingers down her throat. And
          throws up all over the man's desk.
                         
                          AMERICAN 1
           Oh jeez...
                         
          Cat reaches into the goop on the desk and comes up with
          the chip. She hands it over to the man behind the desk,
          who takes a handkerchief out and takes it from her,
          gingerly. He looks at the chip, looks at Cat.

          Cat does not understand. The second American hits a button
          on a remote.

           Yes...my passport.
                         
          INT. AIRPLANE - DAY
                         
          Cat watches out the window as the plane's landing gear
          drops and the city of Miami spreads out before her in all
          it's shimmer and glistening glory.

           Please fasten your seat belts.
                         
          She looks down at the medal around her neck. A tear forms
          in her eye. Rolls down her cheek. Impossible to tell if
          it is a tear of joy or sadness.
                         
          INT. JETWAY - DAY
                         
          Cat, with a plastic envelope holding her travel documents
          around her neck, accompanied by an airline rep, walks down
          the jetway toward the entrance to the airport, where a MAN
          is standing. Looking directly at her.
                         
          All the passengers are filing to the left as they leave
          the jetway, but as Cat and her escort approach the man...
                         
                          MAN
           Come with me.

          Cat stands in front of a rotund bureaucrat, with the man
          who escorted her, handing over her passport.
                         
                          BUREAUCRAT
           She's the one?

           She is indeed.
                         
          The Bureaucrat looks at her passport. As Cat glimpses
          through the slatted window looking out over the Customs
          floor, where all the other passengers are being processed
          in long lines.

           Welcome to America.

          news.

           You like music?
                         
          Cat looks at him, doesn't respond. He turns the radio on.
          A god awful C&W song comes on. Cat looks at him for a
          moment, then reaches over, turns the radio off. Goes back
          to looking out the window.

          run around.
                         
          And suddenly, at the sound of a door opening, they all
          stop and look in the same direction at Cat and the MONITOR

          She exits. All the girls stare at Cat. No one makes a
          move. In the silence, you can hear a pin drop, until...
                         
          The biggest girl in the dorm, a head taller than everyone,
          and twenty pounds heavier, with bully written all over her
          face, saunters down the aisle right towards Cat. Her name
          is...
                         
                          SHERRI

          The girls all around twitter. Sherri looks back at them,
          no good rising on her smirking face.

           There's your bed...
                         
          She points halfway down the aisle to an empty bed. Cat is
          about to walk towards it, when Sherri puts a beefy hand in
          her chest.
                         
                          CAT
           But it's gonna cost you.
                          (BEAT)
           Twenty dollars.
                         
          Cat looks at Sherri. Looks at the other girls all hanging
          on every word, waiting to see what jumps off.
                         
          Cat considers, then reaches into her jumper and extracts
          the twenty dollars the headmisstress gave her. Hands it
          over to Sherri.
                         
                          SHERRI
           A week. Peace has it's price,
           y'know what I'm saying?
                         
          Cat says nothing, just stares at Sherri.

           Are we clear on that?
                         
                          CAT
           Twenty dollars a week.
                         
          Sherri opens her sweatshirt to reveal a fanny pack. She
          unzips it, puts Cat's twenty in with a wad of other
          twenties.
                         
                          SHERRI
           We got a smart one!
                         
          The other girls hoot and whistle. Sherri removes her hand
          from Cat's chest.
                         
                          SHERRI
           You can go now.
                          (BEAT)
           In peace.
                         
          Cat still says nothing. She walks up the aisle past all
          the other girls, who remain silent. It is only after Cat
          has laid down on her bed, that the laughing and twittering
          resumes.
           25.
                         
          Cat stares at the ceiling, her hand reaches inside her
          jumper, takes out the medal her father gave her. She holds
          it close in her hand, just lays that way.

          All the girls are asleep in their beds. Silence reigns,
          except for the small cries and sighs of girls asleep.
                         
          CLOSE ON CAT
                         
          Her eyes still open, her hand clutching her father's medal.
          She gets up.
                         
          INT. HALL - NIGHT
                         
          Cat makes her way down the hall. At the end of the Hall
          is a door marked EXIT. But she is not looking at the exit
          she is looking for something else. And she finds it. A
          door marked: HEADMISTRESS.
                         
          Cat tries the door, it is locked. She takes her father's
          medal from around her neck, and uses it to pop the lock.
          Looking left and right to make sure the coast is clear,
          she enters.
                         
          INT. HEADMISTRESSES OFFICE - NIGHT
                         
          Cat tries the drawer where the Headmistress locked her
          money away. She looks around, takes a letter opener off
          the desk, pops the drawer, extracts the envelope with her
          name on it.
                         
          INT. HALL - NIGHT
                         
          Again Cat walks down the darkened hall, looking for another
          door. Finds it marked: INFIRMARY.
                         
          INT. INFIRMARY - NIGHT
                         
          Cat walks along the cabinets containing the pharmaceuticals
          until she finds what she is looking for. She smashes the
          glass door, reaches in, extracts one bottle.

          Cat, with four belts slung over her shoulder, the bottle
          from the infirmary in one in one hand, a cloth in the other,
          stands over the sleeping Sherri.
                         
          Cat pours the contents of the bottle out into the cloth.
          Seals the bottle. Puts it down. Then takes the cloth and
          places it over Sherri's sleeping face, ever so gently.

          The sun hits the faces of the girls. As they wake, they
          find two very interesting things.
                         
          1. A twenty dollar bill on each bed.
                         
          2. Sherri fast asleep, her hands and feet tied to the post
          of the bed with belts, her shirt pulled up, her money belt
          gone. And the word THIEF written in magic marker across
          her stomach. And the drawing of the Cataleya orchid.

          Cat, barely up to the window, hands the ticket agent the
          piece of paper her father gave her. The woman looks at
          the paper.
                         
                          TICKET AGENT

          MONTAGE DAY/NIGHT
                         
          The landscape of America passes by through the window of a
          bus. Clutching a new Lara Croft comic, nibbling on a big
          Mac and fries out of a bag, Cat sees...
                         
          The sugar cane harvests in the Florida wetlands.
                         
          Two big fat black women sitting on the porch of a shack
          shelling peas in the deep South.
                         
          The Steel Mills of Pittsburgh fire up.
                         
          The endless expanse of corn and wheat stretching from
          horizon to horizon across Ohio.
           27.
                         
          The giant milk barns of Indiana with their hundreds of
          cows.
                         
          And finally, sees the great city of Chicago looming in the
          distance as the bus hurls down the highway towards it.
                         
          EXT. CHICAGO BUS TERMINAL - NIGHT
                         
          As seedy as any bus terminal. People bustling, people
          hustling. A veritable cauldron of humanity bubbling with
          the good, the bad, the ugly. The predators and the prey.
                         
          Cat exits into this stew of life, looks around, checks
          things out. As she is checked out in turn by some pretty
          sleazy types.
                         
          Cat ignores the eyes following her, walks up to a dwarf
          hawking newspapers. Hands him her slip of paper. He points
          her in a direction.

          Cat walks across the neighborhoods of Chicago.
                         
          Sees the signs in Polish change into signs in Italian, in
          Spanish, Chinese, Ethiopian.
                         
          She hands her paper to an Ethiopian cabbie. He points her
          onward.
                         
          She walks past bars where black gangbangers watch her pass.
          She hands one her paper, he points her on.
                         
          She walks past massive churches, synagogues, mosques.
                         
          She walks past the stately houses of the Gold Coast, along
          the deserted stretches of the glam shops on Michigan Avenue,
          over the bridges...

          The denizens of this world look every bit as dangerous as
          they are. Gangbangers, con artists, trouble waiting to
          happen at every turn.
                         
          ANGLE ON CAT
                         
          Cat, walking down the block as the eyes of everyone she
          passes follow her. She stops on a street corner. Seems
          lost. Opposite her a group of men, hanging outside a bar
          see her. The leader of the group calls her over.
                         
                          MAN

                          MAN
           It's late, and this is not the
           kind of place a kid should be
           hanging out. What are you doing
           here?
                         
          Cat hands him her paper. He looks at her, suspicious.
                         
                          MAN
           Who are you?

           Wait here.
                         
          He disappears up a small alley into the darkness beyond.
          Cat, not knowing what to do, sits down on the curb, watches
          street life. She sees...
                         
          Hookers soliciting men in passing cars.
                         
          Cops sitting in a patrol car, bored, blase.
                         
          Men playing craps against a wall.
                         
          Some very discreet dope deals, more sleight of hand than
          anything else.
                         
          CLOSE ON A FIST COLLIDING WITH A FACE

          EMILIO RESTREPO, 35, a hard case, fuck with me at your own
          risk written all over his face, is about to deliver another
          crushing blow to a poor soul strapped to a chair when...
                         
                          MAN
           Emilio.
                         
          The beating stops, Emilio turns.
                         
                          MAN
           There's a girl looking for you.
                         
                          EMILIO
           I'm not interested in a girl right
           now.
                         
          He turns back to the task at hand. Cocks his fist.
           29.
                         
                          MAN
           It's not that sort of thing. She's
           eight.
                         
          Again, Emilio stops. The man hands her Cat's paper.
                         
                          MAN
           Says her name's Cataleya.
                         
          This focuses Emilio's attention.
                         
          EXT. STREET - NIGHT
                         
          Cat is sitting watching the street, when a pair of legs
          appear in front of her. Cat looks up to the man who
          disappeared.
                         
                          MAN
           Come with me.
                         
          He turns abruptly, heads back up the alley.
                         
          EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
                         
          Cat follows the man through a darkened alley. At intervals,
          on either side, dangerous looking men, armed to the teeth,
          stand in the shadows. The man opens a door, beckons Cat
          to enter.
                         
          INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Cat follows the man as he moves down a long hallway. Cat
          looks into the rooms on either side of the hall as she
          walks along.
                         
          In one room, opening out to a trucking bay, TV sets are
          being unloaded into a big warehouse full of stolen
          merchandise.
                         
          In another room, guns are being serviced. Lots of guns,
          hand guns, assault rifles. Big artillery.
                         
                          MAN
           Hey!
                         
          Cat's attention is drawn away from the room with the guns,
          to the Man holding a door open for her at the very end of
          the hall.
                         
          INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
                         
          Cat enters an office with three women working on computers.
          Looks like any other business office. At the sight of
          Cat, the women get up and exit, closing the door behind
          them. Cat is left alone.
                         
          She looks around the office, when the sound of a door
          opening behind her. She turns to Emilio. Who approaches
          her cautiously, scrutinizing her.
           30.
                         
                          EMILIO
           Cataleya?
                         
          Now it is Cat who hesitates.
                         
                          CAT
           Uncle Emilio?
                         
          Emilio covers his mouth, seems rocked.
                         
                          EMILIO
           Madonna! I thought you were dead!
                         
          He crosses himself.
                         
                          EMILIO
           I thought you were all...
                         
          Cat stands stock still. Emilio takes her up in his arms,
          lifts her, crushes her to his chest. Cat remains suspended,
          emotionless for a moment. And then, for the first time
          emotion, real emotion, washes across her face. Her lower
          lip begins to tremble. Tears well up in her eyes. She
          bursts into tears.
                         
                          EMILIO
           You're safe now.
                         
          All the emotion, the fear, the anger that she has kept
          locked away deep inside, rushes to the surface in one
          massive wave.

          EXT. CHICAGO - MORNING
                         
          The sun peeks over the horizon, spreading the fog infused
          light coming off Lake Michigan across the sleeping city as
          it ascends in the sky.

          One beam of sunlight slips through the narrow crack between
          a window and the shade covering it.
                         
                         CLOSE ON
                         
          The ray of sunlight washes across Cat's sleeping face.
          She wakes slowly. Her eyes open after a long sleep. For
          a moment she does not remember where she is.

          Cat looks around the clean, orderly bedroom as she gathers
          her thoughts. Her eyes move around the room. It is a
          boy's room.

          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
                         
          Emilio sits reading the financial section of the morning
          paper over what seems to be the remains of a very hearty
          breakfast. An elderly woman, grandmotherly, fills his
          coffee cup.
                         
                          EMILIO
           Gracias mama.
                         
          A noise turns both of them to the doorway and Cat.
                         
                          EMILIO
           Good morning.
                         
                          MAMA
           Buenos diaz Cara. Come. Sit.
           I'll make you some eggs.
                         
          Mama caresses her face, her eyes glisten with a
          grandmother's love. Kisses her on the forehead, lovingly,
          whispers into her ear.
                         
                          MAMA
           You have your mother's beautiful
           eyes. Don't be scared. This is
           your home.
                         
          Slowly, hesitantly, Cat makes her way across the kitchen
          to the table, where she sits opposite Emilio, tentative.

           Well good. A growing body needs
           sleep. When I was your age I would
           sleep half the day. I don't know
           if it helped with the growing, but
           I was well rested for whatever
           came after.

          Mama comes over, puts a plate of eggs in front of her. As
          she begins to wolf down the food. He holds up the page of

          Chewing, Cat shakes her head.

          She keeps shoveling food in her mouth. Emilio looks up at
          his mother, who crosses herself. Cat finishes the last
          mouthful, looks up.

          in the opposite direction.

           I've already been to school. I

           don't want to help me, fine. I'll
           do it myself.
                         
          She walks off. Emilio grabs her.

           Chica. Any idiot can be a killer.
           Look!
                         
          Emilio draws a .357 magnum pistol from his shoulder holster,
          and empties the entire clip into the front of a car coming
          down the street. The car careens off the road, smashes a
          fire hydrant, crashes through a plate glass window of a
          shop across the street. The water from the hydrant shoot
          twenty feet in the air. Emilio holsters his gun.

           If you want to be a killer, and
           survive, you have to be a smart
           one. You have to know things
           besides how to pull a trigger.
           You have to know how the world
           works. How people think. You got
           to learn to be psychological.
           That I cannot teach you, unless
           you learn the basics at school.

          Cat glares at him.

           Now what's it going to be?
                         
          He holds out the gun in one hand, and the schoolbag in the
          other. Cat hesitates for a moment. Takes the schoolbag
          from Emilio. Then takes his hand, and they walk off
          together as police sirens announce the arrival of cruisers,
          and people pour out of the school and the surrounding
          stores. As they put distance between the chaos and
          themselves.

          CRASH!!!!
                         
          The front end of the cop car gets sheared right off by the
          impact. Glass shatters, metal crunches, airbags explode!
                         
                         ANGLE ON
                         
          The other car. The drivers door opens. A vodka bottle
          falls out, clinks to the sidewalk. And a moment later,
          two legs emerge from the car. Two very long, very shapely
          legs. Legs that never end. In very high heels, and a
          very short mini skirt. And the face on top of it, framed
          by a mane of wild hair, is drop dead think-you-have-died-
          and-gone-to-heaven gorgeous. The whole package reads
          SUPERMODEL. And by the way she is weaving when she stands,
          and the bottle at her feet, the read is; very drunk
          supermodel. Who looks at the crumpled police cruiser,
          looks into the windshield of the cruiser at the stunned
          cops, and says in the most sweetly drunk voice...
                         
                          SUPERMODEL
           Oops...
                         
          The cops can't believe this. They regain their wits and
          bolt out of the car.
                         
                          COP 1
           That's all you have to say? Oops?
                         
          And, ever so sensually, she starts to laugh. The cops
          look at each other, perplexed. And she keeps laughing.
           37.
                         
          The cops get pissed.
                         
                          COP 1
           Funny?
                         
          ...and she keeps laughing.
                         
                          COP 1
           Wanna laugh you crazy bitch? I'll
           give you something to laugh about!
                         
          And even when they slam her to the hood of the car, jam
          her hands behind her back, and slap the cuffs on, she keeps
          laughing, and laughing.
                         
          CLOSE ON HER CHEST
                         
          WHERE A VERY FAMILIAR MEDALLION ON A CHAIN HANGS BETWEEN
          HER EXPOSED CLEAVAGE. A MEDALLION ENGRAVED WITH THE
          CATALEYA ORCHID.
                         
          IT IS CAT, ALL GROWN UP.
                         
          INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
                         
          A quiet night in the small station. Cat stands in front
          of the booking desk, so drunk the two cops have to hold
          her up. A surveillance camera over the desk innocuously
          records everything. Cat keeps her head down, her face,
          obscured by her mane of hair.
                         
          As the SERGEANT goes through her purse, finds...
                         
                          SERGEANT
           No license, no registration. No
           ID except a library card. Well
           Ms...
                         
          He reads off the library card.
                         
                          SERGEANT
           Valarie Phillips in addition to
           all that...you're being charged
           here with DUI, destruction of police
           property, driving the wrong way on
           a two way street...
                         
                          CAT
           Is that it?
                         
                          SERGEANT
           Unless you can think of anything
           else you should be charged with.
                         
                          CAT
                          (TIPSY)
           Wearing no panties?
           38.
                         
          The Sergeant and the arresting cops holding her up give
          her a long look, as do any of the other cops in ear shot,
          whose eyes go to her very short skirt.
                         
                          SERGEANT
           That's not a crime.
                         
                          CAT
           Thank goodness.
                         
          And she teeters over, passes out cold right on the
          Sergeant's desk.
                         
                          SERGEANT
           Take her in the back, lock her up,
           put a cup of coffee in with her.
           Let her sleep it off, we'll book
           her tomorrow.
                         
          The two cops who booked her drag her out. As they do, the
          Sergeant and the two other cops on duty lean over to try
          and get a look up her very long legs and her very short
          skirt.
                         
          EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
                         
          Three black SUV's, with blacked out windows, come rolling
          up to the station. The doors open and a dozen U.S. MARSHALS
          jump out. Vigilant, forming a cordon around one of the
          vehicles, out of which comes a hand cuffed, kevlar wearing
          hard as nails MAFIA type. GENNARO RIZZO.
                         
          The Marshal's surround him, guns bristling, on the look
          out for any danger, and hustle him towards the doors of
          the police station.
                         
          INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
                         
          The station doors slam open. Marshal's barge in. The
          HEAD MARSHAL approaches the surprised Sergeant on the desk,
          flashes his credentials.
                         
                          MARSHAL
           US Marshal Warren. We have Gennaro
           Rizzo here on an overnight.
                         
                          SERGEANT
           Who?
                         
                          MARSHAL
           Rizzo. The Mafia guy? On the way
           to testify up in San Francisco
           tomorrow? They didn't notify you?
                         
                          SERGEANT
           Hold on a second.
                         
          He rifles through some papers. Finds one.
           39.
                         
                          SERGEANT
           Here we go. Says here you're not
           expected until tomorrow.
                         
                          MARSHAL
           Never expect the expected Sergeant.
           (to his men)
           Secure this place.
                         
          INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT
                         
          The Marshals come down the cell block, checking everything
          out. They pass Cat in her cell, passed out cold, her long
          legs and short skirt slows their progress a bit. After a
          long look, they move on.
                         
          INT. SECURE CELL - NIGHT
                         
          Rizzo is pushed into a cell. The door is slammed and
          locked.
                         
                          MARSHAL
           One man here. Two more outside the
           front door. Everyone else on the
           perimeter, in teams of two.
                         
          He hands out thermos bottles.
                         
                          MARSHAL
           It's a caffeine kinda night fellas.
           Eyes open.
                         
          INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT
                         
          A lone cop passes Cat's cell, doing the nightly rounds.
          As soon as he is gone...
                         
                         ON CAT
                         
          Cat's eyes snap open. She sits up, moves with the
          efficiency and determination of someone who has not has a
          drop of alcohol. She takes a spoon from the coffee cup
          left for her, reaches into her mane of hair and extracts a
          small pin. She inserts the pin into the keyhole of the
          door, jiggles it. The door pops open.
                         
          Cat exits the cell, takes a broom leaning in the corner,
          and keeping her eye on the camera above the door, she slides
          along the wall, until she is just under the camera. She
          uses the broom handle to tilt the camera up just a bit.
                         
          INT. SECURITY MONITORING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          One lone cop sits in front of the various monitors. He
          does not notice that one tilts slightly up, points toward
          a blank wall.
           40.
                         
          INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT
                         
          Cat, under the camera, unlocks the second door, slips out.
                         
          INT. HALL - NIGHT
                         
          Cat comes into the hall where several vending machines
          lean against the wall. On the far side is a door marked:
          ELECTRICAL. She is about to head for it, when she hears a
          door open at the far end of the hall.
                         
          ANGLE ON THE DOOR
                         
          At the far end of the hall. A cop comes in, looks down
          the hall. Where Cat was standing he sees only the vending
          machines. He heads right for the machines. Puts coins in
          the machine, waits for his food.
                         
          ANGLE ON THE SIDE OF THE MACHINE
                         
          Where Cat is pressed hard against the flat surface, inches
          from the cop.
                         
          The sandwich falls, the cop retrieves it, moves off, exits
          down the hall. Cat waits until she hears the door shut on
          the far end of the wall. She crosses quickly to the door
          across the way, enters.
                         
          CLOSE ON A UTILITY BOX PULLED OPEN
                         
          Revealing the electrical control panel for the station.
                         
          PULL BACK TO
                         
          INT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Cat stands on a narrow shelf, undoes the last screws on a
          vent in the ceiling with a screwdriver from the tool board
          on one wall.
                         
          Cat drops down, opens the electrical control panel on the
          wall, studies it for a moment, finds the switch she is
          looking for, then turns to the wall of tools, plucks some
          wire, a cutter, a spring.
                         
          Cat sets to work on a jury rigged mechanism with the items
          at hand. When she is finished, she tugs at the waist band
          of her mini skirt, and little by little she stretches a
          thin dun colored leotard suit over her whole body. She
          takes a small plastic vial, fills it with some water from
          the tap, and sets it, just so, above the device she has
          constructed.
                         
          The device is hooked to the switch she selected, a small
          weight hangs from the bottom of it by a wire. She sets
          the water container just so over the spoon from her cell.
          The water begins to drip a drop at a time. She closes the
          panel door, sets her digital watch. Hoists herself up to
          the vent in the ceiling, and is gone.

          INT. AIR DUCTS - NIGHT
                         
          Once inside the grate, Cat takes one of the buttons off
          her blouse and presses the top of it. The button becomes
          a pin light, which she clasps between her teeth, starts to
          crawl on her stomach, pulling herself along by her elbows
          and her wriggling hips and knees, the light still between
          her teeth.
                         
          TRACK WITH CAT
                         
          As she moves through the maze of ducts. On the way, she
          peers through the grates in each ceiling, down into one
          cell after another, catching various views of inmates asleep
          as she passes over them. Until she comes to a ventilation
          fan blocking the way. The fan blades go round and round.
          Cat looks at her watch, looks at the fan.
                         
          CLOSE ON THE ELECTRICAL PANEL
                         
          And Cat's jury rigged device. The water has almost filled
          the spoon, one more drop, one more drop.
                         
          CLOSE ON CAT LOOKING AT HER WATCH

                         CLOSE ON
                         
          The last drop of water drips into the spoon, the spoon
          tips, tugging on the wire, the wire trips the switch it is
          connected to, the whole device comes apart, the separate
          pieces fall to the floor.

          The sergeant at the desk hears the ventilation system go
          off.
                         
                          SERGEANT
           Hey Doyle!
                         
          He calls to one of the other cops on duty.
                         
                          SERGEANT
           Go take a look at the breaker on
           the ventilation system, will ya?

          Cat watches the blades of the vent fan slow. When they
          have completely stopped she starts to move herself through
          the very narrow space between the now stilled blades, feet
          first.
                         
          INT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Doyle enters the room, opens the electrical panel. The
          spoon, the weight, the spring, and the wire, fall to the
          floor. Doyle looks at them curiously for a moment.

          Doyle looks at the switches, going down the printed list
          on the door, trying to locate the right one.

          Cat is just through, when the blades start moving, brush
          against her forehead, as she makes it to the other side
          with no time, and no room to spare.

           43.
                         
          Then walks over to the door at the end of the wall. He
          hits a buzzer on the wall.
                         
          INT. SECURITY MONITORING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          The cop manning the bank of monitors, wakes up, sees the
          Marshal in the monitor.
                         
                          MARSHAL
                          (OVER INTERCOM)
           Gotta pee.
                         
          The monitor hits a button.

          INT. SECURITY MONITORING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          The cop on duty hears a buzz, looks up to the bank of
          monitors, and sees the Marshal standing at the door.
          Thinking nothing of it, he hits the buzzer.
                         
          INT. HALL - NIGHT
                         
          Cat, propping the unconscious Marshal up, hides behind
          him. As the door buzzes, she maneuvers the body around,
          pushes through. On the other side, she drops the body,
          and takes his gun.
                         
          INT. SECURITY MONITORING ROOM - NIGHT

          Rizzo is half asleep, when the barrel of a gun taps him on
          the head. He opens his eyes slowly to...
                         
                          CAT
           Unbutton your shirt.

          Rizzo looks over to where the Marshal is passed out cold
          on the floor. He does as he is told.
                         
                          RIZZO
           Who the hell are you?

          The knocked out Marshal comes to. Finds a gun in his hand.
          Doesn't get it, until he looks over to see Rizzo, with his
          face blown off.
                         
          INT. PROTECTIVE CUSTODY - NIGHT
                         
          The door flies open and the Marshal's and cops come pouring
          through, to find the Marshal with the gun in his hand and
          the dead Rizzo.

                          MARSHAL

          Cat looks through the vent over the cell. Sees the wobbly
          confused Marshal with the gun in his hand, hears feet coming
          fast.

          She looks out over the side of the building. Marshal's
          stationed outside are running into the building.
                         
          Cat takes off running.

          Cat hears the door begin to open. She bangs her high heels
          together. And two blades come out of the front. She sees
          the door knob turning. She runs for the roof's edge.
                         
          AND VAULTS OVER THE SIDE!

          Clinging to the wall like a gekko. The dun colored wall
          blending with her dun colored suit. How is she doing this?
                         
          CLOSE ON CAT'S SHOES

          The cops, finding nothing, head back out the door. A moment
          later...
                         
          CLOSE ON THE ROOF LEDGE

           47.
                         
          When one hand has a firm grasp on the roof ledge, she lets
          go with the other hand and grasps the ledge, extracts the
          blades from the brick seams, and swings herself up on the
          roof. As her shoes dislodge, some mortar comes loose and
          falls below.
                         
          ON THE COPS BELOW
                         
          The crumbling mortar falls on the head of one cop, he looks
          down, sees the crumbly gravel, looks up, sees nothing.

          The cops look at the women's cells, heading right toward
          Cat's. As they reach Cat's, the same cop who did the rounds
          at the beginning of the night looks into her cell. Cat is
          laying on her side, away from them, dead asleep, in the
          same position she was when the cop first checked on her.
          The cops pause for a moment, then move on.

          closing, and then she breathes out, relieved.

          An ambulance pulls up, along with the Marshal contingent
          in their SUV's. The Marshal's spill out of the SUV's as a
          gurney with a corpse is wheeled into the morgue.

          On Rizzo's chest the word TRAITOR is written in thick black
          letters. And above them, a drawing of the Cataleya orchid.
          The Marshal's knows what this is.
                         
                          MARSHAL
           Holy shit! Call Ross.
                         
          EXT. SMALL AIRPORT - MORNING
                         
          The door of a small jet opens and MARCUS ROSS, 48, a keen
          eyed, no nonsense all business FBI agent, followed by a
          team of similarly focused men and women, exits down the
          stairs to...
                         
                          MARSHAL
           Agent Ross?

          EXT. POLICE STATION - MORNING
                         
          Reporters are gathered, trying to gain access. The police
          are keeping them out.
                         
          INT. POLICE STATION - MORNING
                         
          Over the clamor of reporters outside, Cat is just finishing
          with her finger printing, wipes off as much of the ink as
          she can. The Sergeant hands over her library card.

           What's going on out there?
                         
          Alluding to all the commotion she sees through the window
          looking out into the main room.

                          SERGEANT

           I probably deserve it.
                         
          He hands her a sheaf of papers and a pen. As the pen hits
          the paper.

          Keeping her back to the security camera overhead, Cat
          collects her things and exits. As the door closes...

          Ross sees cops coming and going from the station. He turns
          to the Marshal with him.

          Walking away from the pandemonium she is leaving behind.
          As it recedes over her shoulder, she picks at her fingers
          where the fingerprinting ink has stained them. Her prints
          come off! She drops the fake prints down a sewer and keeps
          walking.

          A Lincoln town car comes down the leafy, quiet street of
          well kept homes. Stops at a gate guarded by two men, who
          wave him through.

          sits at the end of a long driveway. Toward the era of the
          walled property, a garage, and a guest house. MR. RICHARD,
          in a suit and tie, looking like a proper mid level
          government official, or a lawyer, exits, newspaper in hand.
          As he approaches the front door, Richard looks over to see
          two more guards, off to the side. He nods to them, knows
          them. They nod back.
                         
          Richard approaches the front door, knocks. While he is
          waiting, he looks down at the paper.

           Coincidence? Twenty two times? A
           flower that only grows in one place
           on earth? That used to be the
           calling card of...what was his
           name? Your former partner? The
           one who did your wet work?

           Fabio. Fabio Maria Restrepo. But
           I don't understand? Why come here
           with this?
                         
                          RICHARD
           Because when we find the end of a
           string we like to know where it
           begins.

           String? Now we are talking about
           string? I'm not a tailor.
                         
                          RICHARD
           Don Luis. Let's cut to the chase
           here, OK? When the Agency extracted
           your ass from Colombia fifteen
           years ago, and set you up here, we
           let you resume your business when
           what we should have done was lock
           you up for life. In exchange, you
           were supposed to keep the
           information flowing.

           Not much, and not for a very long
           time.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           And this is what you traveled all
           the way down here to tell me?
                         
                          RICHARD
           No. What I traveled all the way
           down here to tell you, is there's
           a limit to our patience. The CIA
           is not an amusement park. There
           are no free rides. Everyone pays
           their way. And you, my friend,
           have not.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           OK OK. What would you want?
                         
          He slaps the newspaper down with the picture of Rizzo.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           I had nothing to do with this. I
           swear.
                         
                          RICHARD
           Then find out who does.

                          RICHARD
           And Don Luis, don't play the
           innocent with us. It won't sit
           well with my bosses if we find out
           you had anything to do with this.
           Have a good day.

          Don Luis reaches out, fast as a Cobra, grabbing Marco by
          the lapel, pulling him close.

          The total full on crush of people that a major metropolitan
          bus terminal holds. She sees a surveillance camera tucked
          in a corner. She pulls the brim of her hat low over her
          eyes, takes off into the crowd.

          INT. CAT'S APARTMENT - DAY
                         
          Cat enters a completely bare bones dwelling, there is
          nothing that identifies the person who lives here. White
          bare walls, a table with one chair, a single bed. Along
          one wall, a cabinet. On the window sill a single Cataleya
          orchid. Cat waters the orchid.
                         
          Cat opens the cabinet to three computer screens. Two of
          them are divided into quarters and show various views of
          the building entrance, the lobby, the stairway, the
          elevator, the hallway.
                         
          The third screen is dark, until Cat hits a button and music
          fills the apartment. Music with a heavy sensual back beat.
          French Rap. Ooh la la. And the screen pulses and glows
          in time to the beat. Cat's body responds to the music,
          moving sexy, her shoulders rolling, her hips swaying.
                         
                         IN CUTS
                         
          Cat sashays across the open space, a stripper strutting
          her stuff; shedding, first her blouse, then her jeans, her
          lingerie, until, by the time she reaches a free standing
          opaque cylinder of a shower with an opaque shower curtain,
          she is completely nude. She enters the shower. Turns on
          the water.
                         
          Like a snake shedding a skin, she lets the water divest
          her of everything that came before.

                          DANNY
           Wouldn't you like to go to dinner
           sometime?
                         
          She keeps nibbling.
                         
                          CAT
           Uh-uh. This taste good enough.
                         
                          DANNY
           Or a movie?
                         
          Licking him.

           No. They put me to sleep.

           spend the night here?
                         
          She stops. Looks him in the eye.
                         
                          CAT
           Would you like the key back?

           No. I just want to get...I don't

           Closer?
                         
          She resumes nibbling on his neck.
                         
                          DANNY
           Yes. Closer.
                         
          She runs her nails down his chest, slowly, teasing. Her
          hand finds his groin. What she finds makes her smile.

           ...Yes.
                         
          She gently lowers his hands to his sides, holds them there.
          Kisses him deeply. Pushes him down onto the floor. And
          lowers herself on top of him. A small moan escapes his
          lips as she takes him inside her.

          Danny wakes. His face holds the smile of the memory of
          the night before. He turns his head, lazily. The pillow
          beside him is empty.
                         
                          DANNY

          Emilio loads laundry from the shopping bag into a machine,
          puts in the coins, then sits down on a bench to watch the
          cycle. Seems to talk to himself.

          Emilio takes a manila envelope out of the bag. Places it
          on the seat next to him. Cat picks it up, looks through
          it.

           He disappeared fifty billion
           dollars. The money was never
           recovered. Skipped out and bought
           himself citizenship on some shit
           hole of a Caribbean island that
           calls itself a country with no

           Sure. Of course. But the way
           you're playing it. They even have
           a name for you. The Tag killer.
           I would have stopped it a long
           time ago. Had I known about this.

           Because I love you.
                         
          Cat smiles. A smile that could melt ice in winter. But a
          knowing smile. A 'Don't bullshit a bullshitter' smile.
                         
                          CAT
           If you do, you would never have
           let me get involved in the first
           place.
                         
          The truth of her words deprive him of his. She kisses him
          him on the forehead.
                         
                          CAT
           I love you too.
                         
          And she exits, leaving Emilio more concerned. He looks
          down at the picture.

          A ramshackle warehouse, it's windows streaked opaque with
          years of dust and grime, surrounded by a fence, and a weedy
          garden which is home to dozens of the most unique wind
          chimes of all sizes and shapes, made from scrap metal.
          And two of the biggest, most ferocious dogs on Earth, laying
          on their sides, asleep.
                         
          The dog's ears perk up; hearing something we don't, a low
          growl begins to rumble deep in their throats. The gate to
          the garden begins to open, and like a shot the dogs are
          up, hurling themselves toward the opening gate, eyes
          flashing, barking loud enough to scare the dead back to
          life, fangs bared, ready to kill.
                         
          And then they stop cold when they see who it is coming
          into their domain.

          the chunks of meat.

          She picks up the shopping bags, and heads for the ramshackle
          warehouse. The dogs moan, but do not move, their eyes
          going from the meat to Cat.
                         
          Cat reaches the door. Turns. Sees the dogs looking at
          her.

          The dogs pounce. Each one grabs a roast and tears into
          the meat with ferocious, pent up glee. Cat smiles at the
          sight, enters the warehouse.

           it.
                         
          Cat kisses Pepe, taps one of the chimes, it makes the most
          ethereal sound as one chime bangs against the other. She
          opens a cupboard in the makeshift kitchen area, and starts
          unpacking the groceries.

           And the salsa Verde?
                         
                          CAT
           And the salsa Verde.
                         
                          PEPE
           Not the one in the short bottle.
                         
                          CAT
           The long one.

           I hate that other one, the chili
           they use sucks. Did you see your
           uncle?
                         
                          CAT
           Of course.
                         
          She moves from the kitchen, walks across to the far wall.
                         
                          PEPE

          with an impregnable door.

           I should do a lot of things.
                         
          She turns the combination knob.
                         
                          PEPE
           You could start with that one. It
           would make us very happy.

          stacks of cash.

          Cat starts to remove some of the cash. Starts to count
          it. Stick it in her pocket.
                         
                          CAT
           Rewarding.
                         
          She takes a passport out.

           You work too much. I keep telling
           that to Emilio. The girl should
           have a life while she is still
           young enough to enjoy it. You
           should take a vacation. Go some
           place warm. With a nice beach.
                         
                          CAT
           Good idea.
                         
          She slams the big safe door shut.

          From the air, surrounded by the bluest of waters. Bestowed
          with the greenest of verdant foliage. Surrounded by
          exquisite beaches.

          EXT. COMPOUND - DAY
                         
          An exquisite villa surrounded by a high wall. As the girls
          clamber out of the pool, ignoring the four armed body guards
          patrolling poolside, they are met by three maids holding
          robes for them to slip into.
                         
                          WILLIAM
                          (SMILING)
           Hey! I pay to see more, not less.
                         
          The robes disappear.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           That's better.

           Always!
                         
          As William slips into a robe held open for him, he grabs
          the asses of two of the girls...
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Lunch is served.
                         
          Giggling, the girls scamper toward the villa, where a
          sumptuous table is set on the veranda, attended by more
          servants. William is handed a drink, as he sips it, watches
          their perfect, barely covered butts, his eyes pools of
          desire, the servant holds out an envelope.
                         
                          SERVANT
           For you sir.
           69.
                         
          Perplexed, William takes his eyes off the girls and regards
          the envelope. No return address, no stamps. He opens it,
          and his perplexed look goes to one of concern.
                         
          CLOSE ON THE NOTE
                         
          It says. SOMEONE IS LOOKING FOR YOU. BE CAREFUL. A

                          SERVANT
           It was in the post box this morning.
                         
          William cannot fathom what this is all about. But he does
          not like it.
                         
          EXT. CARIBBEAN ISLAND - SUNSET
                         
          Over hot dance hall music, the sun sets magnificently into
          the shimmering sea...
                         
          INT. VILLA - EVENING

          INT. SALON - EVENING
                         
          Two of the girls dance erotically for William, who reclines
          on an oversized couch, smoking from a hookah.

          The third girl is out in the foyer, laying on the glass
          floor, which is the top of a large aquarium, where dozens
          of sharks swim back and forth.
                         
                          GIRL
           Here fishy fishy!
                         
          She taps on the floor, the sharks ignore her.
                         
                          GIRL
                          (POUTY)
           Willie! They're ignoring me!
                         
          William comes over.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Put a drop of blood in there and
           they'll be your biggest admirers.
           All the way down to your stripped
           clean bones. And speaking of
           stripped...
                         
          He lifts her up like a piece of luggage. As she squeals
          with delight...
           70.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Bedtime!
                         
          The other girls come running. The party moves up the
          winding staircase. The bodyguards look at each other,
          roll their eyes.
                         
          INT. VILLA - NIGHT
                         
          William is at the double doors to his massive bedroom suite,
          the girls are on the bed in the BG jumping around, in the
          skimpiest bra and panty sets, having a pillow fight.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           (to head of security)
           Bring extra security in for the
           night.
                         
                          HEAD SECURITY
           Yes sir.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           And make sure we're shut down tight.
                         
                          HEAD SECURITY
           Yes sir. Have a good night, sir.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           I intend to.
                         
          The doors close, and lock. Wild shrieks come from inside.
                         
          EXT. VILLA - EVENING
                         
          A van rolls up to the main gate, half a dozen security men
          exit.
                         
                          HEAD SECURITY
           There are already guys in the garden
           and guys out back. I want you
           three upstairs, two on the roof.
           You three downstairs. Follow me.
                         
          As they all enter the villa, the CAMERA lingers on the
          van. A figure dressed in black rolls out from under the
          carriage as it pulls away and disappears into the bushes.
                         
          QUICK TIME CUTS
                         
          Two guards stand outside the bedroom door. Two guards are
          on the stairs. Three guards in the salon. Three more in
          the garden outside.
                         
          INT. VILLA - NIGHT
                         
          The Head of Security goes around the villa checking that
          all the doors and windows are secure. His men are posted
          outside the door to the bedroom, on the stairs, in the
          salon. He closes lights as he goes.
           71.
                         
          He walks across the aquarium floor in the foyer to the
          front door, closes the lights, so that only the glow from
          the aquarium lights illuminate the dark. And he exits,
          closing the door behind him, turning the lock.
                         
          CLOSE ON THE AQUARIUM
                         
          The sharks gliding back and forth. And then, a figure in
          a black wet suit, fins and a mask, with a small back back,
          comes gliding into through the sharks. Who just go about
          their business. The figure stops at the edge of the glass
          floor, takes something out of the back pack and very
          skillfully cuts a small hole in one of the glass panels
          that makes up the floor.
                         
          The diver lifts out of the aquarium, pulls back the wet
          suit. It is Cat.
                         
          Cat opens the backpack, removes a silencer fitted pistol.
                         
          CLOSE ON THE BEDROOM DOORS OPENING
                         
          Cat enters, silent, closes the door, approaches the bed
          where William is asleep sandwiched between the three passed
          out girls. Empty champagne bottles and glasses are strewn
          about.
                         
          Cat stares down at the scene, points her gun at William.
          One of the girls rolls over onto William, ruining her shot.
          She hesitates.
                         
          CLOSE ON WILLIAM'S FACE
                         
          As sits up suddenly, startled from sleep. No one is in
          the room. He looks around, and notices the bedroom door
          ajar. He is more awake now, sees the Nymphettes sleeping
          soundly. He rises, dressed in a silk sleeping robe. He
          feels something on his chest, goes over to the mirror,
          opens his gown and sees, painted on his chest: In red
          lipstick, the word THIEF, and a drawing of a Cataleya
          orchid. Panic starts to set in.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Hello?
                         
          No answer.
                         
          William tip toes to the ajar door. He peeks out and sees
          two guards with bullets through their foreheads, blood
          leaked out across the white marble floor. Really panicked,
          he flattens himself against the inside of the door, his
          breath coming in gasps.
                         
          INT. VILLA - NIGHT
                         
          William, holding the two guns of the dead guards in front
          of him, makes his way down stairs, past two more dead
          guards. Growing more and more nervous by the moment, he
          tries a light switch on the wall, nothing.
           72.
                         
          The only light comes from the ambient glow of the aquarium
          below. He reaches the bottom of the stairs.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Anybody?
                         
          No answer. He crosses the aquarium floor, and when he is
          right in the middle...
                         
                          CAT
           Stop right there.
                         
          Cat comes out of the dark. In her hand, a silencer fitted
          pistol.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Who are you?

           Doesn't matter who I am.
                         
          He pulls the trigger on his gun. Click, click, click. He
          tries the other one. Again click click click.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           What do you want?

           I want you exactly where you are.
                         
          And then, without warning, she puts a bullet in both his
          knees.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           ARRRGGGHHHH!
                         
          He falls to the floor. The blood starts to seep out onto
          the glass. The sharks swim back and forth.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Whatever they paid you, I'll double
           it!
                         
                          CAT
           You know the thing about sharks.
           You can swim with them all day and
           they will just ignore you, but put
           one drop of blood in the water and
           they become your biggest admirers.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Please. I'll give you anything
           you want. Don't kill me!

          She fires three shots into the glass square he is kneeling
          on. The glass shatters. William falls into the water.
          Grabs onto the squares on either side and props himself
          up. His blood runs down into the clear water. Cat turns
          and walks toward the door.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Please! Please!
                         
          He struggles frantically to pull himself out. Cat exits.
          And then the sharks hit. WHAM! And hit. And hit. And
          hit.
                         
                          WILLIAM

          It is Marco and two of his thugs. As he is crossing the

          EDUARDO, a small time hood, lines up a shot with a pool
          cue, when a hand comes down on the ball he is about to

          there is a hesitation, a tension in the air. As they break
          marco takes a roll of cash out.

                          EDUARDO
           For what?

                          MARCO
           You went to school with his brother
           in law. What was his name? Emilio?

           Like I said...my memory...
                         
          Now the men at the bar are starting to take notice.
                         
                          MARCO
           I have a problem. And we think
           Fabio's kid is behind it.
                         
          Eduardo takes the roll of bills and puts it in Marco's
          shirt pocket.
                         
                          EDUARDO
           Look Marco. I gotta be honest
           with you. Everyone knows you guys
           were playing a double game, and
           when the shit went down, you were
           the only ones who got out of it
           clean.
                         
          The men at the bar are now edging closer. One of them has
          a shot gun resting along his leg, inconspicuous, and
          conspicuous at the same time.

                          EDUARDO
           Yeah. For rats. Now get the fuck
           out, and let me take my shot.
                         
                          MARCO
           OK...
           78.
                         
          Marco looks at Eduardo, who glares at him. Eduardo goes
          to line up his shot. The tension in the room is thicker
          by the moment. As Eduardo is about to hit the ball, Marco
          grabs his hair and slams his forehead into the cue ball.
          At the same moment, Marco's two thugs whip out their guns
          and blast away. The shotgun wielding man, raises his gun,
          and as he is killed by Marco, his blast takes out one of
          Marco's thugs.
                         
          In an instant it is over. Everyone is dead, except Marco,
          one of his thugs, and the dazed Eduardo. Marco notices
          his ear is bleeding, touches it, it pisses him off that
          blood has soiled his white shirt.
                         
                          MARCO
           Fuck...
                         
          Pissed, Marco yanks Eduardo up from the floor and slams
          him onto the pool table. Sticks his gun in his face.
                         
                          MARCO
           You don't tell me what I want to
           know by the count of three, you
           scum sucking lowlife prick, your
           memory will be permanently disabled.
           One...two...
                         
          A buzzer sounds...
                         
          EXT. STREET - NIGHT
                         
          Danny opens the door to his building.
                         
          INT. DANNY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
                         
          Danny enters to a candle lit room and...
                         
                          CAT
           I brought you something.
                         
          She is in a very sexy lingerie top. Her hands are behind
          her back.
                         
                          DANNY
           That's real progress. Let's see.
                         
          She takes her hands out from behind her back, presents him
          with a cute little stuffed alligator.
                         
                          DANNY
           Wow! Just what I always wanted.
                         
                          CAT
           You're making fun.
                         
                          DANNY
           No. No. I mean, a gift from you.
           Something to show me you're thinking
           of me as more than your boy toy.
           79.
                         
                          CAT
           Well, there's that too.
                         
          She starts to peel off the lingerie.
                         
                          DANNY
           Wait.
                         
          She stops.
                         
                          CAT
           You don't want me?
                         
                          DANNY
           Of course I do. But can't we talk
           a little first?
                         
                          CAT
           What would you like to talk about?
                         
                          DANNY
           Oh, I don't know. Nothing.
           Anything.
                         
                          CAT
           You really want to do this?
                         
                          DANNY
           Yes, I do.
                         
                          CAT
                          (AMUSED)
           OK.
                         
          She stands there, waiting.
                         
                          DANNY
           So...what's new?
                         
                          CAT
           Nothing much.
                         
          She stops. Waiting.
                         
                          DANNY
           Where have you been?
                         
                          CAT
           On vacation.
                         
                          DANNY
           Really? Where?
                         
                          CAT
           Down south.
                         
                          DANNY
           Where there are alligators?
           80.
                         
          He wiggles the toy.
                         
                          CAT
           There was that one.
                         
                          DANNY
           Was it nice?
                         
                          CAT
           It was OK.
                         
                          DANNY
           What did you do?
                         
                          CAT
           Nothing much. A little swimming,
           fed the fish.
                         
                          DANNY
           OK. Now you.
                         
                          CAT
           Now me what?
                         
                          DANNY
           Conversation. It goes two ways.
                         
                          CAT
           OK. Want to fuck?
                         
          Danny starts to laugh. Cat, caught in the moment, begins
          to laugh as well.
                         
                          DANNY
           OK. OK. I get it. You want to
           protect yourself. I understand.
           But I'm...I don't just want to be
           here for the sex. I know a lot of
           guys would think this is perfect.
           She comes over, we fuck like mad.
           She leaves. But I need a little
           more.
                         
          She keeps staring, waiting.
                         
                          CAT
           Like what?
                         
                          DANNY
           Like...uh...some trust maybe.
                         
                          CAT
           That's a hard one for me.
                         
                          DANNY
           I got that. I'm not in a hurry.
           And just so you know. The past?
           If it's too painful right now?
                          (MORE)
           81.
                         
                          DANNY (CONT'D)
           If you can't talk about? That's
           OK. But, you know, if someone
           hurt you before...like a broken
           heart or something. I'm not
           responsible for that. I just want
           want to be here for you. To know
           a little about what's inside.
           What you feel. Just a little.
                         
          Cat hesitates, standing there half dressed, feelings that
          she never wants to deal with coming to the surface.
                         
                          CAT
           I'm lonely sometimes.
                         
          She stops.
                         
                          DANNY
           ...And?
                         
                          CAT
           Isn't that enough?
                         
                          DANNY
           It's a good start.
                         
          He smiles, puts the stuffed animal aside.
                         
                          DANNY
           Now we can have sex.
                         
          Cat smiles, caught a bit off guard by his sweetness. He
          approaches her, she goes to touch him. He puts her hands
          down, gently.
                         
                          DANNY
           Let me this time.
                         
          And for the first time, she lets him touch her first.
          Let's him kiss her lips, her neck, and as he goes south,
          kissing as he goes, the CAMERA holds on her face, and for
          the first time she allows herself to receive, to give
          herself over to being the seduced rather than the seducer.
          And she likes it.
                         
          FADE TO BLACK
                         
          EXT. CHICAGO - SUNRISE
                         
          The city wakes.
                         
          CLOSE ON DANNY
                         
          Waking. Turning over, expecting to find no one there.
          Surprise this time. Because there is someone there,
          sleeping peacefully, her face, half covered by her hair,
          bathed in the soft light of dawn...
           82.
                         
          Cat.
                         
          Danny smiles, so pleased.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
                         
          Danny puts the finishing touches on a breakfast tray. He
          looks at the stuffed animal she brought him. It warms his
          heart.
                         
          INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
                         
          Danny stands with the breakfast tray, looking at Cat
          sleeping. He cannot quite believe it. He puts the tray
          down, takes his iPhone, points it at her, goes to take a
          picture.
                         
          REVERSE ON CAT
                         
          She wakes with a start. To find Danny standing there with
          a breakfast tray, and a big smile on his face.
                         
                          DANNY
           Morning.
                         
          Cat is disoriented.
                         
                          DANNY
           I didn't know if you like your
           eggs over easy or scrambled, so I
           made...
                         
          Cat jumps out of bed, starts to dress quickly.
                         
                          DANNY
           Wait...
                         
                          CAT
           I shouldn't have done this.
                         
          Pulls on her jeans.
                         
                          DANNY
           Done what?
                         
                          CAT
           Any of it.
                         
                          DANNY
           Why?
                         
                          CAT
           Because.
                         
                          DANNY
           Can we talk about it?
                         
          Pulls on her top.
           83.
                         
                          CAT
           We already talked. I'm late.
                         
          Slips into her shoes. Does not answer.
                         
                          DANNY
           I made breakfast.
                         
                          CAT
           I don't like eggs.
                         
          As she heads for the door, she turns.
                         
                          CAT
           Now you know something else about
           me.
                         
          And with a small smile, she is gone.
                         
          INT. HALL - MORNING
                         
          Outside Danny's door, Cat crosses to the elevator, waits
          for it to come. As she does, she fixes her clothes a bit,
          her eyes on Danny's door.
                         
                          CAT
                          (TO HERSELF)
           Don't come out. Please. Don't.
                         
          The door doesn't open. The elevator arrives. She takes a
          deep breath, enters. The door closes.
                         
          EXT. PAINT SUPPLY STORE - DAY
                         
          Cat comes running in.
                         
          INT. PAINT SUPPLY STORE - DAY
                         
          Cat hurries down the aisle, keeping an eye on the security
          camera. Making sure she stays on the far side, out of
          it's range. She stops in the middle of the aisle, starts
          to examine paint brushes.
                         
                          CAT
           Sorry I'm late.
                         
          ANGLE ON EMILIO
                         
          Standing next to her, looking at a color chart, hidden
          from the security camera, as is she. He is pissed. He
          has the newspaper with Woogard's picture. He throws the
          paper in her face. Cat is taken aback by a display of

          first time, she seems a bit lost.

          Danny sits by his window, also feeling a bit lost, and
          also, so lonely. He stares at the picture of Cat on his
          phone. When the phone rings.

           I took a picture of you while you
           were sleeping. With my phone.
                         
          Cat leaps out of her chair, on full alert now. She opens
          her cabinet to the four screens.
                         
                          DANNY
           Jen. I'm sorry. Really. I didn't
           mean to offend you.
                         
          Cat attaches a device to her computer. Does not respond.
                         
                          DANNY
           ...it's just you looked so cute.

           not even a good picture...Jen?
                         
          Cat is not listening, she is looking at a message flashing
          across the screen. THIRD PARTY ON LINE.

          Cat hangs up, rushes into the bathroom, turns the shower
          on full blast. Hurrying out, on her screens, she sees the
          SWAT swarming into the building. Cat opens a cabinet. On
          the back of the door are a dozen keys. She chooses one.
          She checks the screens one more time, sees the SWAT rushing
          the stairs, the elevators. She turns off her screens.
                         
          And runs out of the apartment in her t-shirt and panties.
          Barefoot.

          opens, and Ross and his team step out, guns raised,
          exercising extreme caution, keeping very quiet.

          He reaches out to grab her. Cat grabs his hand and slams
          his face into his tray of food, knocking him cold.

          across the garage, using the parked cars as cover from the
          security cameras.

          Cat reaches an open space where cars just cannot shield
          her. There are two security cameras covering it. Cat
          draws one of her silencers and shoots the lens out of one
          camera.

          several crews of workers welding, hammering, doing repairs.
          She disappears into the gloaming.

          Cat walks through the house like it could be a trap, a
          silencer in her hand. Her senses are keening, she is that
          alert. And then she finds the first body.
                         
          Mama. Dead. A bullet in her head.
                         
          Cat has all she can do to keep it together. Then she finds
          Pepe, a bullet in his head. It is almost too much for her
          to bear.
                         
          And then she finds Emilio, tied to a chair, tortured. To
          death. This IS too much for her to bear.
                         
          Cat cuts Emilio's beaten and bloodied body loose, and gently
          takes HIM in her arms. And begins to cry.

          The building is emptying out. In the lobby, Ross passes a

          Ross enters, turns on the lights, revealing an apartment
          as austere as Cat's. Heads for the small kitchen, where
          he is about to put his precooked meal in the microwave.
          When he feels a gun in the back of his neck.
                         
                          CAT
           This won't take long. Hands up.
                         
          Ross raises his hands. Cat reaches around, removes his
          gun.
                         
                          CAT
           Turn around.
                         
          Ross faces her.

          She motions him into the chair behind him.
                         
                          ROSS
           Just so you know, all this? Being
           so smart? Covering all your bases?
           It's not going to matter. It's
           already over. The whole place is
           wired with web cams.
                         
          His moment of triumph is short lived. Cat reaches on the
          side of the counter. Holds up six web cams, wires ripped
          out.
                         
                          CAT
           You mean these?
                         
          Tosses the ripped out cams onto the table.
                         
                          CAT
           Talking about covering all your
           bases. Your chair is pressure
           wired. You move your ass one inch
           you don't have one anymore.
                         
          Ross looks under the chair. Sure enough, there are several
          wires leading out of the bottom of the chair. He looks
          further to the where the wires attach to a small charge.
          She puts her gun down on the table.
                         
                          CAT
           I know what you're thinking. Maybe
           yes a bluff, maybe no. But you
           have to figure yes, given what you
           know about me.
                         
          Ross does not move.

           This wasn't what I had in mind for

          She takes out an old picture of Don Luis, lifted from the

          She places the photo album in his lap. Puts his food in
          the microwave, starts it. Goes to exit.

          And she is gone. Ross watches the timer on the microwave.
          When it beeps, he sits a moment longer. Hesitates to get
          up. Little by little, he moves himself off the chair,
          tentative. Afraid that any moment, BOOM! Until he makes
          the final move, stands just enough to clear the seat,
          waiting for the worst to happen. And when it doesn't, he
          breathes a sigh of relief.

                          RICHARD
           You understand, I only agreed to
           this meeting out of professional
           courtesy.

           out to you folks on the domestic
           side, and all that pie in the sky
           crap.

           you at all.

                          ROSS
           Look, let's put all our cards on
           the table here. I've met this
           woman. The killer.
                         
                          RICHARD
                          (SKEPTICAL)
           Really? Where?
                         
                          ROSS
           My apartment. She trapped me.
           She told me if I did not get her
           this man.
                         
          He puts Luis's picture on the desk.
                         
                          ROSS
           She will kill a member of my family
           every day until I have none.
                         
          Richard pauses. Then he begins to laugh.
                         
                          RICHARD
           You're kidding me?
                         
                          ROSS
           Do I look like I could make
           something like that up?
                         
          Richard says nothing.
                         
                          ROSS
           So? What should I do now?
                         
                          RICHARD
           I'd go to the police. Now if you'll
           excuse me, I have a meeting...
                         
          He goes to rise, when Ross's phone rings. He answers.
                         
                          ROSS
           Ross.
                          (BEAT)
           It's her.
           103.
                         
          Richard sits back down.
                         
                          ROSS (CONT'D)
           She says you either give her what
           she wants or she is going to
           redecorate your office.
                         
          Ross points to Richard's chest where a red laser beam holds
          on his heart.
                         
                          ROSS

                          RICHARD
           What does she think this is?
           Amateur hour? Tell her that glass
           is tempered to resist a direct hit
           by a fifty seven millimeter
           ordinance.
                         
          All of the sudden, a bullet shatters the window; destroying
          a picture of Richard standing with the President hanging
          on the wall just behind his head. The red dot is back on
          Richard in a heartbeat.
                         
                          ROSS
           She says she's using seven point
           six two steel jacketed armor
           piercing shells. And you have ten
           seconds to give her the address.
                         
          Richard starts to come unglued.
                         
                          RICHARD
           How can I be sure once she has the
           address she won't kill me anyway?
                         
                          ROSS
           You can't. But I can assure you
           that if you don't give her the
           address you will be number twenty
           four on her hit parade. Trust me
           on this one.
                         
          After an interminable moment...

                          ROSS
           She asked you to keep this

          A moment later, the red dot disappears from Richard's chest.
          Richard breathes out. Ross reaches out, shakes richard's
          limp hand.
                         
                          ROSS
           Thank you. Because honestly I
           didn't know how I was going to
           explain you splattered all over
           your walls.
                         
          Ross exits. Richard looks at the shattered picture. The
          President's head is intact. The bullet has ripped Richard's
          face clean off.

          Looking back at him. Pointing a finger at him. Before
          she disappears in to the drifting mists.
                         
                         ANGLE ON
                         
                          MARCO
           Don Luis! You hide here.
                         
          He opens a secret door in the wall, revealing a small space.
          Barely big enough for a man.
                         
                          MARCO
           Wait for my call. Either she is
           dead, or we have her far enough
           away so you can make it to the
           garage. Take the van. The armor
           is so thick nothing short of an
           atomic bomb can penetrate it.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           Marco. Thank you.

           That's the first time you ever
           said that.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           Said what?
                         
                          MARCO
           Thank you.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           Don't get used to it.
                         
          Don Luis shuts the door. Off the door slamming...
                         
          Another door opens, but this one is...
                         
          EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
                         
          On the side of the mansion, and leads into the foundation.
          Cat crawls in and pulls the door shut.
                         
          INT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
                         
          Marco and the men are walking through the mansion, guns at
          the ready, when they come to a long stretch of hallway.
          Marco signals them to stop. He listens carefully. Signals
          for one of the men to move down the hall.
                         
          As Marco and the other men wait, the first thug makes his
          way down the hall, looking left and right, opening doors...
                         
          ANGLE ON UNDER THE FLOOR FROM THE CAMERA'S POV
                         
          As the man walks along above, the floor creaks, dust drops
          down in a fine cloud. As the man progresses, and the dust
          gets closer and closer...
                         
          ANGLE ON THE THUG ABOVE
                         
          Turns to Marco to signal everything is OK. Just as he
          signals he is riddled from below with dozens of bullets.
          The man dances like a puppet on a string, before falling
          to the floor, dead. Marco takes a grenade out, flings it.
                         
                          MARCO
           Down!
                         
          Marco and the thugs dive for cover.
                         
          BAARROOM!
                         
          The grenade blows a big hole in the floor. As soon as the
          smoke and the debris stop falling...
                         
                          MARCO
           Go!
           109.
                         
          The thugs hesitate. Marco points his gun at them.
                         
                          MARCO
           Now!
                         
          Hesitant, the thugs approach the hole. Pointing their
          weapons, they unload a barrage of bullets. Then stop.
          Nothing moves. One of them peers over the side.
                         
          BANG!
                         
          A single shot pieces his eye.
                         
                          MARCO
           Outside!
                         
          The thugs and Marco run...
                         
          EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
                         
          The thugs set up two big ass 50 caliber machine guns at
          the two openings in the foundation.
                         
                          MARCO
           Kill her!
                         
          The thugs manning the guns let loose, blasting away. Smoke
          and flashes from the muzzles mingle with the fog.
                         
          INT. CLOSET - DAY
                         
          Don Luis hears the firing, which thunders through his
          closet.
                         
          EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
                         
          The thugs fire until their ammo is spent. As the sound
          dies away, silence reigns.
                         
          INT. CLOSET - DAY
                         
          Don Luis hears the silence. He speed dials on his phone.
                         
          EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
                         
          Marco's phone rings.

           Checking.
                         
          He motions for one of his men to look into the dark hope.
          Hesitant the man peeks around the side. Nothing happens.
                         
                          MARCO
                          (WHISPERS)

          INT. CLOSET - DAY
                         
          Don Luis lets out a sigh of relief.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           Did you see the body?
                         
          EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
                         
          Marco urges his man to look deeper, expose himself more,
          to look in the hole. Marco watches as the man does so,
          very cautiously. Still no movement. He moves full body
          into the opening to peer in.
                         
          BANG! BANG! BANG!
                         
          Is blown back by three fast shots.

           Stay where you are!
                         
          And then he starts screaming into the hole, careful to
          stand just off to the side.
                         
                          MARCO
           You know what bitch? I loved
           killing your father. He was a
           coward! And you know what else?
           I screwed your mother behind your
           father's back! We all did! She
           couldn't get enough of it! The

           with your name on it, Bitch!
                         
          Silence. And then, a whistle from above. Marco looks up
          to see Cat, standing on a second floor balcony with two
          pistols.
                         
                          MARCO
           Kill her!
                         
          Marco starts to fire, his men raise their guns. Too late.
          In the blink of an eye, with bullets flying wildly all
          around her, Cat blows five of the seven thugs surrounding
          Marco away. Marco and the remaining two thugs run toward
          the guest house. Out of the range of her guns.
           111.

          Don Luis is panicking. Yelling into the phone.

          Marco and the two thugs run into the small house.
                         
                          MARCO
           You two here! That door opens...
                         
          He points to the door they just came through.
                         
                          MARCO
           ...kill anything that comes through.
                         
          Marco runs into the bedroom.
                         
          INT. BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          Marco runs to the curtained windows, rips the curtains
          back, hoping to escape. And finds that the windows have
          metal hurricane shutters on them. With locks. Marco pulls
          out a set of keys, frantically tries fitting the keys to
          the locks. None of them work.
                         
                          MARCO
           Shit!
                         
          He runs for the door again. Just as he has his hand on
          the knob, two shots ring out.
                         
                          MARCO

           Tonino?
                         
          No answer. He checks his gun, realizes he is out of ammo.
          He knows his time has come. He drops is gun, backs away
          from the door. Backs right up to the bed, and sits down.
          His phone rings.

           112.
                         
          There is a small sound outside the door.
                         
                          MARCO
           I will hold here! Run! Run!
                         
          The door shatters as Cat kicks her way in. Marco pulls
          his trigger. Click! Click! Click! Marco is frozen.
          Just stares at Cat. Waiting for what is going to come.
                         
                          MARCO

          Gripped by fear, Don Luis runs for all he is worth across
          the fog shrouded garden until he reaches the garage. He
          yanks open the door, runs inside.
                         
          INT. GARAGE - DAY
                         
          Don Luis runs around Pepe's red truck and the crumbled
          Mercedes, jumps in the armored van.
                         
          INT. ARMORED VAN - DAY
                         
          Don Luis fumbles with the keys, grinds the ignition in his
          desperation. The engine turns over. Don Luis slams the
          transmission into gear, but bangs into the crumbled Mercedes
          blocking his way. He slams the gearshift into reverse,
          bashes into the wall behind him, and then jerks the gear
          shift into drive, ramming the Mercedes with a little more
          room. Back and forth back and forth, Don Luis rams at the
          Mercedes until he has made enough room to turn the van,
          bang past the Mercedes, and smash his way out of the garage.
                         
          EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
                         
          The van comes roaring out of the garage, tearing up the
          gardens, jumping on the driveway and speeding off to the
          main road.
                         
          Cat comes running from the opposite direction, two guns
          blazing.

          As bullets ping off the van, Don Luis regains some of his
          confidence. A small smile breaks across his face as he
          looks in his rear view mirror and sees Cat running and
          firing, losing ground.

          Humming a tune. When the van phone rings. Surprised, he
          looks at the call coming in. MARCO. He presses the
          speaker.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           Marco?
                         
                          CAT
           It's Cataleya.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           I don't understand you. You should
           have been dead a long time ago.
           You got lucky. You escaped. You
           were given a second chance at a
           life. Why did you not take it?
           Why did you involve yourself with
           this insanity?
                         
                          CAT
           For something you can never
           understand. The love I had for my
           parents. And you killed that.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           And because of that, you have ruined
           your whole life to try to kill me?
           You stupid bitch. Don't you get
           it? Someone like me?
                          (MORE)
           114.
                         
           DON LUIS (CONT'D)
           I cannot be killed. I do the
           killing. Not the other way around.
           And now it is your turn to be
           hunted. You will never find me.
           But as day follows night, believe
           me, I will find you. And I will
           kill you. And you know why?
           Because I will never be where you
           can kill me. I will never be where
           you want me to be.
                         
                          CAT
           Actually Don Luis...you are exactly
           where I want you to be.
                         
          Don Luis doesn't get it. And then he hears a low growling
          behind him. He turns a little, sees sitting there in the
          dark recesses of the van, two enormous dogs. Pepe's dogs.
          His eyes register confusion, then apprehension...
                         
          EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
                         
          Cat hears the growl over the phone. A small smile breaks
          across her face. And then se speaks into the phone one
          last time. One word.
                         
                          CAT
           EAT!
                         
          EXT. ARMORED VAN - DAY
                         
          Over the sounds of the dogs tearing Don Luis to pieces and
          his horrible screams, the van shakes as if it were caught
          in an earthquake.
                         
          EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
                         
          Cat's shoulders sag, relax. Her face is peaceful as it
          has never been before. She looks at Marco's phone.
          Thinking.
                         
           ROSS V.O.
           I want you to think hard...
                         
          INT. ROSS'S OFFICE - SUNSET
                         
          Danny sits opposite Ross.
                         
                          ROSS
           Was there anything else?
                         
                          DANNY
           I already told you everything.
           She would come over, we'd have
           amazing sex, and she would leave.
           It's really late, and I'm really
           tired, if you're not going to arrest
           me...
           115.
                         
                          ROSS
           We don't really have anything to
           charge you with.
                         
                          DANNY
           Then can I go?
                         
                          ROSS
           Just a few more questions.
                         
                          DANNY
           Can I have a cup of coffee?
                         
                          ROSS
           Sure.
                         
          Ross gets up and leaves the room. Danny is feeling really
          shitty. He takes his phone out of his pocket, looks at
          Cat's picture. And then it rings.
                         
                          DANNY

           CAT V.O.
           I'm fine.
                         
          She says it without the slightest bit of sarcasm.
                         
           CAT V.O.
           Where are you?

           FBI headquarters. I didn't tell
           them anything...besides...
                         
           CAT V.O.
           That I would come over and we would
           have amazing sex. Your phone is
           tapped, you know that?
                         
                          DANNY
           I know.
                         
           CAT V.O.
           You have forty seconds before they
           pick up on this. Gives you the
           time for three questions.

           CAT V.O.
           ...Cataleya.
                         
          Danny looks at the orchid on Ross's desk. Sees the name
          tag. Smiles.
                         
                          DANNY
           Like the flower.
                         
          Now Cat smiles. How did he know that?
                         
           CAT V.O.
           Twenty seconds.
                         
                          DANNY
           Will I ever see you again?
                         
                          CAT
           I know where to find you.

          Ross is drawing coffee.
                         
                          AGENT 1
           Ross. We're picking something up
           off that kid's phone.
                         
          Ross drops the coffee, hurries back to the office.

           If there is ever a chance. I want

           ...I love you.
                         
          Cat holds on that one for a moment...then the beeping of a
          phone connection cut...Danny closes his eyes. Ross bursts
          into the office. Grabs the phone from his hands.
