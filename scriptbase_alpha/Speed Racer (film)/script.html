<b>          INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY - PAST
</b>
          A battered sneaker tattooed with doodles of speeding cars
          and checkered flags and the words "Start Your Engines!"
          Beats up and down, a sewing machine needle of anxious,
          restless, adolescent energy.
          A pencil fills in the oval of a standardized test form,
          then hesitates, twitching with the speed of a humming
          bird wing caught between two fingers, then is quickly
          erased as a different answer is chosen.
          The form sheet is filled with smudges of uncertainty.
          A ten year old boy stares at the next question.

<b>          TEST QUESTION
</b>
          Grace buys a bag of 240
          jellybeans. There are 35 yellow
          ones, 52 red ones, 63 green ones,
          26 white ones, 41 blue ones and 40
          black ones. If Grace wants to eat
          one of each while keeping her eyes
          closed, what is the minimum number
          she will have to eat?

          His mouth tries to makes sense of the question but it's
          not working.

          He looks around at the other students quietly, diligently
          filling in their ovals while he fidgets, his leg beating,
          his pencil fluttering, a pot jiggling its lid, about to
          boil over.

          He reads the question again. Greek. Chinese. Meaningless.
          He looks up at the clock. The second hand sweeps towards
          the 12. Then back at the test.

          Something suddenly clicks.

           He stares at the clock, pencil poised, waiting until the
          second hand hits the 12 and he's off-
          Filling in the ovals faster than it seems he could
          possibly be reading the questions.

<b>          INT. TEACHER'S OFFICE - DAY - PAST
</b>
          Mrs. Racer sits across the desk from Speed's teacher.

<b>          MOM
</b>
<b>          DISTRACTED
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          2.
</b>
<b>          CONTINUED:
</b>
<b>          TEACHER
</b>          No, that's not exactly right. Your
          son seems to be interested in only
          one thing.
          Mom knows what's coming.

<b>          TEACHER (CONT'D)
</b>          All he talks about, all he seems
          capable of thinking about is
          automobile racing.

<b>          MOM
</b>          Well you know, his father designs
          racing cars.

<b>          TEACHER
</b>          And where is your husband?

<b>          MOM
</b>          He's-working. He couldn't make
          it.

<b>          TEACHER
</b>          Perhaps the apple hasn't fallen
          very far from the tree.
          Mom is uncomfortable with that truth while the Teacher
          glances back to her records.

<b>          TEACHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Is your husband's name Rex?

<b>          MOM
</b>          No, Rex is his older brother. Why?

<b>          TEACHER
</b>          This is the test he turned in last
          week.
          She holds up the Scantron test that Speed was working on.
          The bottom half of the ovals are filled in to spell out:

<b>          "GO REX GO!"
</b>
<b>          INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY - PAST
</b>
          Speed has finished filling in the test and is now drawing
          pictures in the corner of the test booklet.
          He is drawing little race cars,. He flips a few of the
          pages and we see a quick moment of his animation as two
          cars collide.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          3.
</b>
<b>          CONTINUED:
</b>          He continues to draw as the background of the classroom
          fades to white behind him, becoming the black corner that
          he is drawing on.
          We watch the race going on in his head as hand-drawn cars
          battle each other heading for a photo-finish. Speed
          makes the car noise himself including the jumping sound
          as two cars try to block the Mach 5, smashing into one
          another as --
          The Mach 5 jumps over and through the fiery crash,
          crossing the finish line still in the air.
          Speed is lost in slow-motion revelry, making the sound of
          the roaring crowd.
          The teacher hears him and looks up, frowning as she sees
          him lost in his fantasy world.
          A little girl with a pink barrette also hears him turning
          to watch him, a smile creeping across her face; there is
          no one in the entire school like him.
          The teacher is about to say something when the bell
          rings.
          Speed snaps out of his fantasy and leaps up, in motion
          before anyone else.

<b>          TEACHER
</b>          Alright, pencils down, bring your

<b>          TESTS--
</b>          Thwack! Speed slaps his down and is already heading for
          the door.

<b>          TEACHER (CONT'D)
</b>          --to my desk.
          Ham! The door slams open and Speed shoots out.

<b>          TEACHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Speed Racer, slow down!

<b>          EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
</b>
          Speed slides down the railing on his butt, a perpetual
          motion machine as he scans the street, smiling as he sees-
          Across the street, leaning against his hot rod, his big
          brother, Rex Racer.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          4.
</b>
<b>          CONTINUED:
</b>          He pauses crossing the street letting two impossibly cool
          cars pass by.
          Here we begin to see the unique and individualized nature
          of the automobile in the world of Speed Racer. In this
          world, the grocery store parking lot looks like a car
          collector show; vintage and concept cars are as
          ubiquitous as the Camry is in our world.
          Speed dashes across the street, a tight parabolic arc
          around the car, his little head sticking up like a shark
          fin circling until--
          The car door pops open and snaps shut.
          The seat-belt clicks into place before Rex even has a
          chance to move. He leans over and looks in the window.
          Speed smiles.

<b>          REX
</b>          .I take it you're ready to go?
          Speed nods. Rex climbs in beside him.

<b>          REX (CONT'D)
</b>          So, who was school?

<b>          YOUNG SPEED
</b>          Fine. Are you going to the track?
          Mom said you were. You don't have
          to drop me off, I could just go
          with you.

<b>          REX
</b>          No way.
          He starts the car and roadster growls to life.

<b>          YOUNG SPEED
</b>          Oh, come on, take me with you.
          Come on, please.

<b>          REX
</b>          I can't, Speed. Pops would kill
          me.

<b>          YOUNG SPEED
</b>          He doesn't have to know. I won't
          say anything. Nobody will know.
          Come on, please, Rex, pleaseplease
          pleasepleasepleeeease.
          Rex sighs, knowing there's no way he can with this.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          5
</b>
<b>          CONTINUED: (2)
</b>
<b>          REX
</b>          Are you wearing the socks?
          Lickety-split, Speed sticks his sneaker up against the
          dash board and pulls back his pant leg revealing--
          A bright red sock.

<b>          REX (CONT'D)
</b>          You roll us again and this'll be
          the last time? Deal?
          A ten year old's grin spreads ear to ear.

<b>          YOUNG SPEED
</b>          Deal.

<b>          INT. THUNDERHEAD LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT - PRESENT
</b>
          A lone figure sits on a bench away from us; his racing
          suit is unzipped to the waist and he sits with his head
          down as though he was praying.
          He is wearing a pair of bright red socks.
          After a moment, he pulls his boots on, zips up his suit
          and stands looking into the locker.
          Propped against this gloves is a photo of Rex.
          This is Speed ten years later. He takes the photo and
          slides it into one of the zippered pockets of his suit.
          He grabs his gloves and slams the locker shut.

<b>          EXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT - PAST
</b>
          The first gen T-180 screams along the metal raceway.

<b>          INT. CAR
</b>
          Speed sits in Rex's lap, wearing a too-big helmet,
          giggling with a child's mad glee as he steers.

<b>          EXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT
</b>
          The car.banks up a wall and roars down, swooping past.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          6.
</b>
<b>          INT. CAR
</b>
          Speed screeches as though riding a roller coaster.

<b>          REX
</b>          Feel that shimmy? That's your hind
          legs trying to outrun you're
          front.

<b>          SPEED
</b>          What do I do?

<b>          REX
</b>          Stop steering and start driving.

          Thunderhead is a relatively small track and the media-row

          Inside the cockpit of a racing car that feels more like a
          fighter jet, Speed does the thing he was born to do.
          Though the vibrations are enough to rattle molars loose,
          there is a calmness, a preternatural ease in Speed's
          manner that suggests this maelstrom of velocity is where
          he belongs.
          He hears a voice in his headset.

          It is smaller than a typical crew pit since the cars

          board filled with needled gauges and green-barred light
          meters.
          Sparky is watching through binoculars.

          The cars explode into the next turn when Snake uses the
          draft to slingshot by the car ahead of him--
          Hurling like a bullet straight at Speed as--
          Speed thumbs a button on his steering wheel causing jacks
          to shoot out of the bottom of the car and sending it up
          into the air just as--
          Snake flies under it, careening into the bottom of the
          turn too tightly, bouncing of the rail, out of control,
          ricochetting back at Speed as--
          He turns his wheels, catching a part of Snake's car with
          the grace of a bull-fighter, sending it spinning away
          towards the other cars while--

          I'm here is because of you, Speed.
          I was watching last night and I
          have to tell you young man, you
          gave me goosebumps. I know at
          once, this was no mere driver I
          was watching. This was an artist.

          do not exaggerate when is ay that
          you are a genius. Watching you
          reminded me of why I love racing
          and I am grateful for that. Thank
          you.

          diamond-encrusted champion rings.

<b>          REMMINGTON (CONT'D)
</b>          Speed Racer allow me to introduce
          two-time Grand Prix Winner, five
          time WRL Champion and future Hall
          of Famer, Jack Cannonball Taylor.

<b>          SPEED

</b>          Caught that Thunderhead replay.
          Nice piece of work.

</b>          Wow, thanks.

</b>          There was a rumor you might be
          visiting.

<b>          SPEED
</b>          It's pretty impressive.

<b>          CANONBALL
</b>          Only thing I cared about was that
          wall over there.
          He gestures to a special wall fitted with the trophies
          and medals won by team Remmington through the years.

<b>          CANONBALL (CONT'D)

          shoots a backward glance at Speed that feels like a shank

<b>          POPS
</b>          To be honest, Remmington, I'm
          feeling more intimidated than
          impressed. This kind of company
          scares me. People like you have
          way too much money and when
          someone has this kind of money,
          they start thinking that the rules
          everyone else is playing by don't
          mean squat to them.
          Remmington remains skillfully unfazed.

<b>          POPS (CONT'D)
</b>          However, my sons are the most
          important thing I've ever done in
          my life, besides marrying my best
          friend and if Speed wants us to
          figure out some kind of...
          "alliance" then you can bet your
          ass we'll be in business.
          Speed steps out of the bathroom. His boyishness has faded
          away as he suddenly seems very much a man. Gennie smile
          approvingly.

          the WRL, the world's first racing
          league.
          Remmington leads Speed past several personal mementos
          including the first motor of his first car, the first
          milk bottle from victory lane,.a black and white from an

</b>          Interesting that you and your
          father were so moved by the '43
          Prix. One of the great finishes in
          the history of racing, right?
          Everyone remembers Burns and
          Dugazi slugging it out, but who
          remembers Carl Potts? Driving a
          rebuilt Wittigan for Iodyne .
          Industries, Potts spun out in the
          second lap and went down as a DNF.
          A forgettable and pathetic finish.
          So bad, that afterwards Iodyne
          stock dropped six points.
          Again we see the history told in flashback.

<b>          REMMINGTON (CONT'D)
</b>          Meanwhile, Ben Burns sat guzzling
          cold fresh milk in victory lane, a
          thousand cameras taking his
          picture, Sirrus Aeronautics saw
          almost a twelve point gain which
          immediately block Penninsula Power
          Cell from being able to afford the
          price of a complete take-over.
          This put Joel Goldman, the CEO of
          Iodyne Inc. in the exact position
          he wanted to be in. By first
          buying controlling interest in his
          own company at a devalued price,
          he then brokered a merger with
          Sirrus that immediately sent
          Iodyne into the gains record book--
          the only record book that matters.
          Look out that window, there isn't
          a single plane or helicopter or K-
          Harrier that isn't powered by
          Iodyne fuel cells. That's what
          racing is about. It has nothing to
          do with cars, or drivers. All that
          matters is power and the
          unassailable might of money.
          His greed is as tangible as any drug.

          Remmington is far from done.

<b>          REMMINGTON
</b>          Do you understand? Burns knew he
          was going to win. It was already
          decided. A week before the Prix,
          Goldman and Sirrus met with
          several other major players at the
          Carlyle Hotel. They met there as
          they had for years, just as their
          fathers had met, and as their sons
          and heirs will still meet. They
          met to negotiate the finish order
          of the Grand Prix. No race is more
          important and no race is more
          controlled. That year Goldman was
          supposed to win, but he knew if he
          sold his win to Sirrus, whatever
          that win might be worth, was
          nothing compared to what could be
          gained.

          What you do behind the wheel of a
          racecar has nothing to do with
          business. Before you could even
          talk, you were making noises that
          sounded like a car engine. We
          used to tell people you were
          speaking car-ese. We used to try
          to take you to the park but you
          never wanted to get out of the

          at those moments, when I feel your
          father's chest swell and I know
          he's smiling, trying to pretend he
          doesn't have tears in his eyes, I
          just go to pieces.

<b>          INSPECTOR DETECTOR
</b>          For years he has been contracted
          by a Fixer named Cruncher Block
          who we know works for Remmington.
          Recently, Katsu has been forced to
          lose races that have led to a
          droop in the stock price of
          Okamoto Engineering. We believe
          this is a part of a corporate
          strategy to allow Mushi motors to
          buy control of Okamoto. Katsu
          doesn't want this to happen and he
          began resisting, thinking.that he
          could do it on his own. After
          Fuji, he realized he needed help.

<b>          POPS

<b>          INSPECTOR DETECTOR
</b>          Because he has a file with enough
          information to connect Block to
          Remmington which could put both of
          them behind bars for the rest of
          their lives. The problem is, he
          won't give us the file unless we

          will catapult Okamoto Engineering
          back into the spotlight and double
          the cost of the buy out which
          should kill it.

<b>          ANNOUNCER
</b>          Safety has been the primary
          concern for Casa Cristo officials,
          especially the last few years.

<b>          JOHNNY
</b>          That's right Bob. There were a
          number of fatalities several years
          ago. It really had a bad
          reputation for a while.

<b>          ANNOUNCER
</b>          Fans started calling it "The
          Crucible."

<b>          JOHNNY
</b>          Most of the T-180 drivers wouldn't
          come near it.

<b>          ANNOUNCER
</b>          But you look today, we've got some
          major names like Millie "the
          mouse" Manno, Snake Oiler and
          Katsu Okamoto as well as the young
          rising star Speed Racer. Not to
          mention, the shadow that seems to
          hang over every major race these
          days, the masked racer that some
          fans call the Harbinger of Boom.
          What's your take on Racer X?

<b>          JOHNNY
</b>          But remember Colton, these are

          know a lot of T-180 drivers who I
          raced against who expected to win
          but found out racing a few laps on
          a track is a totally different
          animal than a cross-country rally.

          Billy pours out a fistful of star-dust; the glint of
          diamonds glitter in the greed of his smile.

          under him.

          The Manecks team attacks, their cars flying at Katsu even
          as a second team, the Atomic Injectables led by Tyrus
          Tropp also attacks.

<b>          RACER X
</b>          This surprises me.

<b>          SPEED
</b>          Why?

<b>          RACER X
</b>          Tyrus is a good man. I wouldn't

          Cruncher sits, shadows drawn around him like the folded
          wings of a bat, across from a stoic looking Tyrus.
          Cruncher slides an envelope across the table.
          Tyrus looks at the goons surrounding him, then picks it
          up.
          Inside are the photographs of a beautiful girl playing in
          a park. The hard edge in Tyrus' expression immediately
          softens turning to fear.

</b>
          The swerving, weaving chain of cars churns up a massive
          cloud of dust in their wake.
          Attacking cars are caught and spun out by Racer X and
          Speed.
          A hurricane of sand and dirt swirl around Katsu who sits
          calmly in the eye of the storm while-
          His guardian angels go into overdrive.
          Racer X and Speed seem like they have been driving
          together all their lives.

          As their cars merge in.and out from one another,
          something seems perfectly clear to Speed--
          He is back at Thunderhead with the ghost of his brother,
          dancing around each other until--

          Throwing a lever, a grappler locks on to the Mach 5.

<b>          SPEED
</b>          He's got me! I'm locked up!
          Another lever is pumped like a tire pump and a sheaved
          blade begins stabbing at Speed's tires.
          Racer X watches unable to leave Katsu unprotected.
          Speed hits the D button and the zircon saw blades start
          gliding through the grappler.

<b>          RACER X
</b>          Get out of there! -

<b>          SPEED

          The knife slashes the tire which explodes just as the
          grappler is cut--
          Speed flips away free, hitting the "C" button causing a
          new tire to inflate while he's upside down--
          Landing on a new tire, without missing a beat.
          Tyrus rushes into the opening, but this time it's Katsue
          who works a hidden lever and--
          A Katana-like blade flashes, a samurai slash across the
          front tire--
          Bowing it out, flipping the entire car, which tumbles
          back straight at Speed, forcing him to try a split-jack

          It remains at one level of intensity until---
          Snakes bashes Trixie hard into the rail, driving her
          almost over the edge, causing her to shriek from the
          force of the blow--
          And Speed loses it.
          His jaw clenches, shifting into a whole new level of
          intensity.
          He becomes a cyclone, a whirling dervish, enveloping the
          HydroCell team in a cloud of chaos---
          Throwing, rending,. ripping through them until only Snake
          is left.
          Speed is not kind; battering him until he's not sure if
          he's going forward or backward.
          In a panic, Snakes reaches for a hidden lever but before
          he can take hold of it, Speed clobbers him again, causing
          him to shriek louder than Trixie and then--
          Recede quickly away like a dog with its tail tightly
          tucked.

          surrounding the thin ribbon of road.
          Speed enters the first series of caves bored through

          Flips off the wall just as the cliff face drops off,
          switching sides as--
          Snake now finds himself on the outside as Speed bashes
          him out through the guard rail.
          Snake tries a similar move to Speed but Snake is no Speed-
          And his car bursts apart as he miss-times the flip,
          sending a bouncing cocoon to the distant snows below.

</b>
          Without the lights or banners or crowds, the race track
          echoes with the same quiet portance as a cathedral. It
          is here that Speed has always found himself.
          But as he sails through neck snapping turns with reckless
          abandon, it becomes clear that he is chasing something
          that he has lost.
          He seems ready to cry for all the frustration and anger,
          wanting so badly to undo the last few weeks of his life.
          Suddenly in his rearview mirror there is an answer to his
          prayer, a miracle--
          His brother.

</b>          For a moment he believes that he is again driving beside
          the ghost of his brother but when the two cars kiss up
          against each other, Speed realizes this is no ghost--
          It's Racer X.
          The masked Racer suddenly becomes the focus of all his
          anger and Speed swings his car, wielding it like a club,
          trying to clobber him.
          Racer X dodges the first blow and swings back, the two have
          at one another, banging, shoving one another into the wall--
          Until Speed can't take it anymore and he goes at X as
          ferociously as he can, throwing him into a tailspin--
          Crashing him into one of the grand stands.
          Silence embraces the track.
          Speed climbs out of the Mach 5.

<b>          SPEED
</b>          X? Racer X?
          There is a small movement in the car, a shuddering as
          though in pain and Speed realizes he may have gone too
          far.

<b>          SPEED (CONT'D)
</b>          Racer X?!!
          He runs to the car but immediately stops when he realizes
          the masked man is not in pan; he is laughing. He
          practically falls out of his car.

          From what I've read, that's all he
          tried to do.

<b>          SPEED
</b>          And what good did it do? He got
          killed for nothing. Racing hasn't

          let racing change us. Everyone of
          us has to find the reason to do

          anymore.

          didn't lose Rex when he crashed, I
          lost him here. I lost him when he
          walked out of this house and I let
          him go without telling him how
          proud I was of him and how much I
          loved him. I let him think that a
          stupid motor company meant more to
          me than he did. You'll never know

<b>          CASS JONES
</b>          Look at the split! He's shattering
          the lap record.

<b>          BEN BURNS
</b>          Don't mean a thing without those
          checkers.

<b>          EXT. GRAND PRIX TRACK
</b>
          Speed comes out of the spiral, glimpsing the back of the
          trailers as they go over the Big Drop.
          Where they ease over the edge, Speed hurls out, going
          airborne, free-falling past two trailers, as--
          The grade of the slope reaches up and gently eases the
          Mach 5 back onto the track, to the delight of the crowd.
          The Mach 5 surfs up the big bank, weaving through another
          pair that try to stop him with spectacularly disastrous
          results.
          outside the Mach 5 a maelstrom of violent chaos churns

<b>          WHILE--
</b>          Inside, Speed is perfectly at pease.

<b>          INT. GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCER'S BOOTH
</b>

<b>          CASS JONES
</b>          No hesitation, nothing fazes him,
          no one seems capable of stopping
          him.

<b>          BEN BURNS
</b>          This kid ain't just driving--he's
          on a mission.

<b>          INT. GRAND PRIX PENTHOUSE
</b>
          Remmington can't take it, losing all pretense of decorum.

<b>          REMMINGTON
</b>          Stop him! Stop him!

<b>          
</b>
<b>

<b>          EXT. GRAND PRIX TRACK
</b>
          Speed weaves through the butterfly cloverleaf, taking
          each turn at such intense speeds that the cars he passes
          seem to be moving in slow motion.
          By the end of the slalom, he is back where he left off,
          with two cars left ahead of him--
          Mushi motors and the Gray Ghost.

<b>          GRAY GHOST
</b>          Welcome back kid. Been lonely up
          here without you.

<b>          INT. GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCER'S BOOTH
</b>

<b>          CASS JONES
</b>          With a quarter lap to go Speed
          Racer is back, two cars beneath
          him and destiny.

<b>          INT. MACH 5
</b>
          Speed suddenly feels the weight of everything that has
          brought him. to this point.
          He. sees images and hears voices, flashing through his
          head, as though at his own death.
          The montage finishes with the image of Speed as a ten
          year old boy, drawing pictures of race cars, making all
          the noises, lost in a dreamworld that has become reality.
          He sees the finish line and makes his move.
          The Gray Ghost sees it coming first.

<b>          GRAY GHOST
</b>          Oh yeah, here we go, here we go.
          Speed flashes one way, then another, moving in ghost-like
          feigns, here there, and everywhere.

<b>          GRAY GHOST (CONT'D)
</b>          What's this? What's this? Hey
          now! That's my move!
          Before Ghost knows where to go, Speed ducks past--

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          160.
</b>
<b>          CONTINUED:
</b>          Sling-shotting down alongside the Mushi motors car. The
          Yukuza driver tries to block but--
          Speed jumps, dodging the hit, causing the Mushi car to
          swerve and then wildly correct--
          Swinging back as Speed hop-scotches over him again, just

<b>          AS--
</b>          The Ghost flies in, taking a broadside hit from the Mushi
          car, both of them exploding just feet from the finish
          line, as--
          Speed launches up and through the cloud of smoke and
          fire, crossing into history with the flashing wave of the
          checkered black and white--
          Fluttering softly in the silence as the crowd begins to
          rise to their feet.
          The Mach 5 slides to a stop and for a moment Speed
          catches his breath, then, slowly pulling off his helmet
          he begins to let it all in--
          The thunder of the crowd can be felt through his chest
          straight to his heart.

<b>          INT. GRAND PRIX PENTHOUSE
</b>
          Remmington screams, overturning a table of caviar and
          lobster, crashing the elaborate ice sculpture of the GRX
          at the feet of Mushi who turns and walks away in disgust.

<b>          EXT. GRAND PRIX GRANDSTANDS
</b>
          Pops' chest is out, tears running down to his moustache
          as he wraps his arms around Mom, who goes to pieces as
          Chim-chim and Sprittle leap up and down, hugging Trixie

<b>          AS--
</b>
<b>          INT. GRAND PRIX PENTHOUSE
</b>
          The smiles of Katsu and his father are gone giving Horuko
          no end of secret joy.

<b>          EXT. FINISH LINE
</b>
          The crowd storms over the barriers, swarming Speed and
          the Mach 5.

<b>

</b>

<b>          CASS JONES
</b>          It's a pandemonium! People have
          gone completely crazy! In
          fourteen years we've never seen
          anything like this!

<b>          BEN BURNS
</b>          It's a whole new world baby, a
          whole new world.

<b>          EXT. FINISH LINE
</b>
          The crowd lifts Speed up onto their shoulders as we
          collage-pan to--

<b>          INT. LUXURY BOXES GRAND PRIX
</b>
          Racer X watching his brother, a smile on his lips.

<b>          INSPECTOR DETECTOR
</b>          He did it.
          Racer X lowers his binos and turns to the inspector.

<b>          RACER
</b>          Yes, he did.

<b>          INSPECTOR DETECTOR
</b>          This could change everything.

<b>          RACER X
</b>          It already has.

<b>          INSPECTOR DETECTOR
</b>          My men are bringing the family
          down. Do you want to go with
          them?

<b>          RACER X
</b>          He turns and takes Minx by the arm.

<b>          INSPECTOR DETECTOR
</b>          Can I ask you a question? Do you
          ever think you made a mistake,
          hiding the truth from them?

<b>          
</b>
<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          162.
</b>
<b>          CONTINUED:
</b>          There is a flash of images as we glimpse the truth;
          images of Rex watching his car explode in the ice caves,
          his funeral, then the facial surgery, then the mask of
          bandages as one face is lost in a mirror and another is
          revealed.

<b>          RACER X
</b>          If I did, then it's a mistake I
          have to live with.
          He walks away while---

<b>          EXT. VICTORY LANE
</b>
          Several of the other driver's led by the Gray Ghost
          applaud and salute Speed as--
          The Racer family is led through the swarm of
          photographers and fans.

<b>          TRIXIE
</b>          Speed!
          She pushes towards him and he sweeps her up into his arms
          and kisses her, surrounded by the sparkle of camera flash

<b>          AS---
</b>          Sprittle covers Chim-chim's eyes.

<b>          SPRITTLE
</b>          Danger. May cause cookies.
          Mom and Pops both hug Speed, their eyes bright with joy

<b>          AS--
</b>          We rise up, up, and away.
          Roll snazzy credits.
