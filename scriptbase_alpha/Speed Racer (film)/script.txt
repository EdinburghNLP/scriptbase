                                                        1st Draft

                                                January 4th, 2007

          

          

          

          

          INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY - PAST

          A battered sneaker tattooed with doodles of speeding cars
          and checkered flags and the words "Start Your Engines!"
          Beats up and down, a sewing machine needle of anxious,
          restless, adolescent energy.
          A pencil fills in the oval of a standardized test form,
          then hesitates, twitching with the speed of a humming
          bird wing caught between two fingers, then is quickly
          erased as a different answer is chosen.
          The form sheet is filled with smudges of uncertainty.
          A ten year old boy stares at the next question.

          TEST QUESTION

          Grace buys a bag of 240
          jellybeans. There are 35 yellow
          ones, 52 red ones, 63 green ones,
          26 white ones, 41 blue ones and 40
          black ones. If Grace wants to eat
          one of each while keeping her eyes
          closed, what is the minimum number
          she will have to eat?

          His mouth tries to makes sense of the question but it's
          not working.

          He looks around at the other students quietly, diligently
          filling in their ovals while he fidgets, his leg beating,
          his pencil fluttering, a pot jiggling its lid, about to
          boil over.

          He reads the question again. Greek. Chinese. Meaningless.
          He looks up at the clock. The second hand sweeps towards
          the 12. Then back at the test.

          Something suddenly clicks.

           He stares at the clock, pencil poised, waiting until the
          second hand hits the 12 and he's off-
          Filling in the ovals faster than it seems he could
          possibly be reading the questions.

          INT. TEACHER'S OFFICE - DAY - PAST

          Mrs. Racer sits across the desk from Speed's teacher.

          MOM

          DISTRACTED

          

          

          

          

          2.

          CONTINUED:

          TEACHER
          No, that's not exactly right. Your
          son seems to be interested in only
          one thing.
          Mom knows what's coming.

          TEACHER (CONT'D)
          All he talks about, all he seems
          capable of thinking about is
          automobile racing.

          MOM
          Well you know, his father designs
          racing cars.

          TEACHER
          And where is your husband?

          MOM
          He's-working. He couldn't make
          it.

          TEACHER
          Perhaps the apple hasn't fallen
          very far from the tree.
          Mom is uncomfortable with that truth while the Teacher
          glances back to her records.

          TEACHER (CONT'D)
          Is your husband's name Rex?

          MOM
          No, Rex is his older brother. Why?

          TEACHER
          This is the test he turned in last
          week.
          She holds up the Scantron test that Speed was working on.
          The bottom half of the ovals are filled in to spell out:

          "GO REX GO!"

          INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY - PAST

          Speed has finished filling in the test and is now drawing
          pictures in the corner of the test booklet.
          He is drawing little race cars,. He flips a few of the
          pages and we see a quick moment of his animation as two
          cars collide.

          

          

          

          

          3.

          CONTINUED:
          He continues to draw as the background of the classroom
          fades to white behind him, becoming the black corner that
          he is drawing on.
          We watch the race going on in his head as hand-drawn cars
          battle each other heading for a photo-finish. Speed
          makes the car noise himself including the jumping sound
          as two cars try to block the Mach 5, smashing into one
          another as --
          The Mach 5 jumps over and through the fiery crash,
          crossing the finish line still in the air.
          Speed is lost in slow-motion revelry, making the sound of
          the roaring crowd.
          The teacher hears him and looks up, frowning as she sees
          him lost in his fantasy world.
          A little girl with a pink barrette also hears him turning
          to watch him, a smile creeping across her face; there is
          no one in the entire school like him.
          The teacher is about to say something when the bell
          rings.
          Speed snaps out of his fantasy and leaps up, in motion
          before anyone else.

          TEACHER
          Alright, pencils down, bring your

          TESTS--
          Thwack! Speed slaps his down and is already heading for
          the door.

          TEACHER (CONT'D)
          --to my desk.
          Ham! The door slams open and Speed shoots out.

          TEACHER (CONT'D)
          Speed Racer, slow down!

          EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

          Speed slides down the railing on his butt, a perpetual
          motion machine as he scans the street, smiling as he sees-
          Across the street, leaning against his hot rod, his big
          brother, Rex Racer.

          

          

          

          

          4.

          CONTINUED:
          He pauses crossing the street letting two impossibly cool
          cars pass by.
          Here we begin to see the unique and individualized nature
          of the automobile in the world of Speed Racer. In this
          world, the grocery store parking lot looks like a car
          collector show; vintage and concept cars are as
          ubiquitous as the Camry is in our world.
          Speed dashes across the street, a tight parabolic arc
          around the car, his little head sticking up like a shark
          fin circling until--
          The car door pops open and snaps shut.
          The seat-belt clicks into place before Rex even has a
          chance to move. He leans over and looks in the window.
          Speed smiles.

          REX
          .I take it you're ready to go?
          Speed nods. Rex climbs in beside him.

          REX (CONT'D)
          So, who was school?

          YOUNG SPEED
          Fine. Are you going to the track?
          Mom said you were. You don't have
          to drop me off, I could just go
          with you.

          REX
          No way.
          He starts the car and roadster growls to life.

          YOUNG SPEED
          Oh, come on, take me with you.
          Come on, please.

          REX
          I can't, Speed. Pops would kill
          me.

          YOUNG SPEED
          He doesn't have to know. I won't
          say anything. Nobody will know.
          Come on, please, Rex, pleaseplease
          pleasepleasepleeeease.
          Rex sighs, knowing there's no way he can with this.

          

          

          

          

          5

          CONTINUED: (2)

          REX
          Are you wearing the socks?
          Lickety-split, Speed sticks his sneaker up against the
          dash board and pulls back his pant leg revealing--
          A bright red sock.

          REX (CONT'D)
          You roll us again and this'll be
          the last time? Deal?
          A ten year old's grin spreads ear to ear.

          YOUNG SPEED
          Deal.

          INT. THUNDERHEAD LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT - PRESENT

          A lone figure sits on a bench away from us; his racing
          suit is unzipped to the waist and he sits with his head
          down as though he was praying.
          He is wearing a pair of bright red socks.
          After a moment, he pulls his boots on, zips up his suit
          and stands looking into the locker.
          Propped against this gloves is a photo of Rex.
          This is Speed ten years later. He takes the photo and
          slides it into one of the zippered pockets of his suit.
          He grabs his gloves and slams the locker shut.

          EXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT - PAST

          The first gen T-180 screams along the metal raceway.

          INT. CAR

          Speed sits in Rex's lap, wearing a too-big helmet,
          giggling with a child's mad glee as he steers.

          EXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT

          The car.banks up a wall and roars down, swooping past.

          

          

          

          

          6.

          INT. CAR

          Speed screeches as though riding a roller coaster.

          REX
          Feel that shimmy? That's your hind
          legs trying to outrun you're
          front.

          SPEED
          What do I do?

          REX
          Stop steering and start driving.
          Speed gets serious, his lips tightening the way a hand
          knots into a fist.

           REX (CONT'D)
          This ain't no dead piece a metal.
          A car's a living breathing thing.
          She's alive. You can feel her
          talking to you, telling you what
          she wants, what she needs. You
          just gotta listen.
          Speed tries to listen.

           REX (CONT'D)
           Close your eyes and listen.
          Speed does.

           REX (CONT'D)
          They say that Ben burns drove the
          last lap of the '68 Vanderbilt Cup
          with his eye closed.

          SPEED
          No way!

          REX
          No? Well maybe you can't hear it
          then. Maybe. you ought to start
          hitting those books--

          SPEED
          No! I hear it!

          REX
          That so? Okay Mr. Burns, you tell
          me when to gas it for the jump.

          

          

          

          

          7.

          CONTINUED:
          Speed concentrates..

           REX (CONT'D)
          Now?

           SPEED
          Uh-uh.
          The jump glides towards them as the tires seem to whisper
          to Speed.

          SPEED (CONT'D)
          Now!
          Rex smiles, hitting the gas, launching the car into the
          air where it seems to hang fora moment before rushing
          down at us as we cut--

          EXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY -= NIGHT - PRESENT

          The modern T-180's come flying overhead, slamming down
          against the metal track, scattering bright bursts of
          shooting sparks in their wake.

          INT. MEDIA ROW

          A long stretch of identical glass cubicles that look down
          at the raceway, where announcer's from all over the globe
          provide color commentary for race fans.
          Thunderhead is a relatively small track and the media-row
          should reflect that while it's big enough to be covered
          in several different languages, it is not nearly as
          important as the majors.

          LOCAL ANNOUNCER
          --local fan favorite, Speed racer
          is just gobbling up this track,
          slipping car after car--

          HAROLD LEDERMAN ANNOUNCER
          --no one seems able to lay a glove
          on this kid--

          AUSTRALIAN ANNOUNCER
          --clearly a rising star, with
          several big wins since turning
          pro, though he remains without a
          major sponsor--

          CHINESE ANNOUNCER
          --a win tonight could put him
          within range of qualifying for the
          Grand Prix--

          FRENCH ANNOUNCER
          --let us hope he does not make the
          same mistakes that his older
          brother made--

          INT. CAR

          Inside the cockpit of a racing car that feels more like a
          fighter jet, Speed does the thing he was born to do.
          Though the vibrations are enough to rattle molars loose,
          there is a calmness, a preternatural ease in Speed's
          manner that suggests this maelstrom of velocity is where
          he belongs.
          He hears a voice in his headset.

          SPARKY
          Head's up,.Speed! Seven o'clock. I
          got Snake drafting.Pitter-pat.
          Speed looks into his mirror and sees a car with orange
          and black markings, stacked up tight behind another car.

          SPEED
          I got him.

          EXT. TECH PIT

          It is smaller than a typical crew pit since the cars
          don't really pit. There is a panel like a sound mixing
          board filled with needled gauges and green-barred light
          meters.
          Sparky is watching through binoculars.

          SPARKY
          I figure he'll slingshot after you
          in the next turn.

          SPEED
          I'm ready.

          

          

          

          

          9.

          EXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT

          The cars explode into the next turn when Snake uses the
          draft to slingshot by the car ahead of him--
          Hurling like a bullet straight at Speed as--
          Speed thumbs a button on his steering wheel causing jacks
          to shoot out of the bottom of the car and sending it up
          into the air just as--
          Snake flies under it, careening into the bottom of the
          turn too tightly, bouncing of the rail, out of control,
          ricochetting back at Speed as--
          He turns his wheels, catching a part of Snake's car with
          the grace of a bull-fighter, sending it spinning away
          towards the other cars while--
          Speed rockets free--
          Eliciting a huge roar from the crowd.

          EXT. TECH PIT

          Sparky smiles.

          SPARKY
          Great move, Speed. Careful on the
          butterfly coming up. You may wanna
          ease up--

          SPEED
          Not this time, Sparky.

          EXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT

          Speed careens through a butterfly turn like there was a
          slot-guide in the track causing another crowd roar.
          They can feel that something special might be happening.

          EXT. TECH PIT

          Sparky checks his stop watch.

          SPARKY
          Holy canoli, Speed, You know who
          you're racing?

          

          

          

          

          10.

          CONTINUED:
          He can see him.

          SPEED
          Yeah...
          Just ahead, the ghost of his brother's car launches up
          the second jump and when ti comes down we are back in the
          past.

          EXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT - PAST

          Rex drives the older model T-180, a man on a mission,
          dominating the race exactly like Speed.

          EXT. GRANDSTANDS

          Pops stands watching the race through binoculars Young
          Spped is beside him.

          YOUNG SPEED
          Rex's gonna win, ain't he, Pops?
          Pops checks his watch but almost can't believe it. He
          goes back to his binoculars.

          YOUNG SPEED (CONT'D)
          He's gonna win it. He's gonna set
          the course record. Nobody's gonna
          catch him.

          POPS
          Quiet, Speed! There's a lotta race
          to run.

          YOUNG SPPED
          No way. It's over. My brother's
          the best racer in the world.
          Everybody else is running for
          second.
          The cars rocket through the twisted mobius of steel.

          EXT. CREW PIT

          Blackjack Benelli grabs one of the crew chief, knotting
          his fists in the fabric of the path-covered cover alts.

          BLACKJACK BENELLI
          I told you to take him out!

          fast.

          EXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY

          Rex blazes by, the track rattling like a metal roller-
          coaster, opening an even bigger lead.
          As we move around Rex's car, we see suddenly there is
          someone right behind him, a ghost car--
          Speed.
          As Speed makes his move, he pulls us back into the
          present.

          INT. MEDIA ROW - PRESENT

          The buzz is palpable.

          LOCAL ANNOUNCER
          --it's unbelievable folks, no
          one's seen moves like this, since

          HAROLD LEDERMAN ANNOUNCER
          --there's no doubt in my mind,
          he's gunning for it--

          EXT. GRANDSTANDS

          in the glass of Pop's binos we can see the dim reflection
          of the two brothers racing.

          CONTINUED:
          Pops stands beside Mom. He is still watching the race
          with his trusty binos though he is now a little older,
          plumper and balder..
          He clicks his stopwatch, checking it at the same time
          that Sprittle checks his. Sprittle stands on the chair
          next to him.

          SPRITTLE
          Jeepers, he could do it, Pops. He
          could really do it, couldn't he?
          Pops goes back to his binos.

          SPRITTLE (CONT'D)
          What if he does? What if he does
          it, Pops?

          POPS
          Sssh!

          SPRITTLE
          I don't know if I can watch
          this...
          He holds the binos as though afraid to look when--
          A hairy hand comes in and takes them away.
          Chim-chim, sitting on the chair next to Sprittle, puts
          the binos to his eyes.
          Speed flies through a piece of tricky track drawing
          another cheer.
          Sprittle grabs the binos back just as the beautiful young
          woman, standing on the other side of Pops, lowers her.
          Trixie chews at her lip, feeling a knot twist into her
          gut.

          EXT. SUBURBAN STREET- DAY - PAST

          The little girl wearing the pink barrette is walking with
          a pack of girls, their little mouths as sharp as razors.
          In the distance we hear a high-pitched motorized whine.

          BLONDE PACK LEADER
          My Daddy told me he used to work
          for the Mishida Motorwerks but he
          quit.

          BLONDE PACK LEADER (CONT'D)
          My daddy said that was a
          completely crazy thing to do. He
          says the whole family is crazy.

          TRIXIE
          Speed's not crazy.

          BLONDE PACK LEADER
          No, he's just dumb. Probably the
          dumbest kid in class. Ms.
          Waterstraat had me alphabetize the
          IRB tests and you wouldn't believe
          what that retard did--
          Sock!
          Trixie decks her to the shock of the rest of the pack
          just as the whine grows very loud and--
          Speed comes rounding the bend on a little go-cart,
          wearing his too-big helmet making his big head seem
          ridiculously enormous.
          Zipping past, he suddenly notices the girl in the pink
          barrette standing over another girl; there is something
          about her--
          Maybe it's way she's got her fists up, like a boy, or
          maybe it's the. way her jaw is set, ready to take on

          ANYONE--
          Whatever it is, when their eyes suddenly meet, he finds
          he is unable to look away--
          Staring at her, as he drives off the road, crashing
          through a hedge and tumbling down a hill.

          TRIXIE
          Speed!
          She runs to help him.
          He is laying sprawled out, his car on its side, wheels
          still spinning.

          TRIXIE (CONT'D)
          Are you alright?
          He's a bit groggy.

          SPEED
          .who are you?

          TRIXIE
          I'm Trixie. I'm in your class.

          He stares at her for a minute, powder-puffs of clouds
          floating about her head.

          SPEED (CONT'D)
          He, would you like to see my car

          She smiles.

          TRIXIE
          I'd love to.

          INT. POP'S GARAGE

          Pops and Rex are working on the T-180. Rex is in a wife-
          beater, up to his elbows in axel grease.
          The sound of an angry bee hive fills the room as Speed
          drives up through the big open door.

          SPEED
          Hey, Rex. Hey Pops.

          RE X
          Hey, Speedy.

          POPS
          Who's your friend?

          SPEED
          Her name's Trixie. She's in my
          class.

          TRIXIE
          Hi.

          POPS
          Pleasure to meet you, young lady.

          SPEED
          Hey pops, a guy wanted me to give
          this to you. He said he was a big
          fan.
          He hands him the package and Pops smiles.

          POPS
          A fan, is it? Not often we get
          someone with such good taste
          around here. Where is he?

          The car description rings a bell for Rex.

          REX
          Let me see that.
          He grabs the box, then holds it to his ear.
          It's ticking.
          He jams it into the go-cart, against the pedal and slaps
          it in reverse.
          The go--.cart shoots out of the garage and down the
          driveway until--
          It explodes, an enormous fireball ballooning up past the
          tree tops.
          Trixie's eyes flash with excitement.

          TRIXIE
          Cool beans!

          Feeling the storm of emotions that she knows Speed must

          When are you coming back?

          No you don't. This is a choice.
          You're selling out, walking away

          You can't tell me what to do. It's

          The whole table shivers and it seems the hanging ceiling
          light might shake free when the tremor begins to subside.
          Sprittle and Chim-chim, wearing a pot and a metal
          colander for protection, look around, expecting something
          bad to happen.

          The doorbell rings.

          INT. LIVING ROOM

          Pops opens the door to a face full of turbine exhaust
          from the private K-Harrier jet parked on their front
          lawn.
          On their doorstep is an extremely well dressed older man
          carrying a bouquet of flowers and box of cigars.
          His smile is as bright and shiny as a surgeon's scalpel.
          He says, "Good morning, Mr. And Mrs. Racer" but no once
          can hear him over the howl of the turbines.
          He gestures, asking permission to come in. Pops lets him
          by and closes the door, immediately reducing the noise.

          Uh, thanks but... who are you?
          He seems to rise up an inch taller as he introduces
          himself.

          Esquire, President and Chairman of
          Remmington Industries and it is my
          honor to meet you both.
          He reaches for Pops' free hand.

          REMMINGTON
          Mr. Racer, I have been an ardent
          admirer of your work for years. I
          remember the first time I saw the
          prototype for the Mach-1, I told
          everyone that it didn't belong on
          a race track, it belonged in an
          art museum.
          Pops chuckles.

          POPS
          Yeah, she was a beaut.

          REMMINGTON
          No, sir. She was a revelation.
          He suddenly smells the pancakes.

          MOM
          Are you hungry, Mr. Remmington?

          REMMINGTON
          A figure like mine requires
          constant attention, Mrs. Racer.

          MOM
          Do you like pancakes?

          REMMINGTON
          When I was a child we used to say,
          "pankuken zin liesben."
          Neither of them speak German.

          discomfort.

          REMMINGTON (CONT'D)
          Now, then. We all know the reason
          I'm here is because of you, Speed.
          I was watching last night and I
          have to tell you young man, you
          gave me goosebumps. I know at
          once, this was no mere driver I
          was watching. This was an artist.
          Speed's ears go a bit red.

          SPEED
          Driver's only as good as the car.

          REMMINGTON
          I appreciate modesty, Speed but I
          do not exaggerate when is ay that
          you are a genius. Watching you
          reminded me of why I love racing
          and I am grateful for that. Thank
          you.

          SPEED
          You're welcome, I guess.

          Excellent. The first thing I want
          to make perfectly clear is that I
          have no intention whatsoever of
          trying to get Speed away from
          Racer motors. What you have here
          is what teams spend years and
          millions of dollars trying to
          achieve: chemistry. Car designer,
          mechanic and driver all coming
          together in perfect, harmony. I
          wouldn't dare touch a thing.

          SPEED
          Well, excuse me for asking, but
          what do you want?

          REMMINGTON
          To help. I want to make sure you
          have access to whatever resources
          you need to continue doing exactly
          what you are doing.

          POPS
          I assume, Mr. Remmington that you
          are not talking about
          philanthropy.
          Remmington chuckles.

          REMMINGTON
          I like when my partners have a
          sense of humor. And that's what
          I'm talking about. A partnership.
          An alliance between your amazing
          family and mine. That's exactly
          what Remmington Industries is to
          me, a family. Like yours. Just a
          little bigger.
          Pops isn't exactly buying it.

          POPS
          No offense, Remmington but Racer
          Motors runs as an independent.

          understand. I sympathize.

          remember working all night on a
          Commodore 64 in the basement of my
          foster parents' home. I build R.I.
          From below the ground up. So while
          Remmington Industries may look
          like a Major Sponsor to you, it
          remains in my heart as independent
          to me as the first day I quit my
          job at GloBocom to work for
          myself.
          They're 're stunned into silence, while Remmington
          presses on.

          opportunity to meet your family.

          Remmington considers arguing.

          SPEED
          Don't bother. He's never wrong.
          They pass out of the museum.

          INT. TRAMWAY

          The hall widens allowing a special lane that leads out
          onto an observation deck that over looks the main T-180
          factory.
          The bank of windows overlooks the enormous facility. It
          is a state of the art assembly line that rises
          vertically, instead of horizontally. The chassis arrives
          at the bottom and is born up by a mechanical arm,
          rotating as each platform assembles the next piece.
          The far wall is nothing but glass providing a sun-
          drappled_vista of Cosmopolis.

          REMINGTON
          Our vertically integrated plant is
          the fastest in the world. From
          initial carbon bond to finished
          car in 36 hours. How long does it
          take at Racer Motors?

          SPARKY
          Several weeks at least.
          Remmington turns to Pops.

          REMINGTON
          This kind of production facility
          could be at your disposal, Mr.
          Racer.
          The cart motor hums and slides back onto the tramway.

          

          

          

          

          35.

          INT. ENERGY-CELL THEATRE

          The next viewing stage is a window into the vacuumed-
          sealed laboratory where they construct the "engine" that
          powers the T-180's turbine.
          It looks like an operating theatre with several robotic
          arms and a cluster of auto-surgeons operating inside
          sealed perspec chambers.

          REMMINGTON
          This is our operating theater
          where our patented Refusion Energy
          Distributor Network is installed
          in the turbine drive.
          Sparky's eye light up.

          SPARKY
          Is that an inner-positive
          transponder?

          REMMINGTON
          It is indeed.
          Sparky shoots a look at Pops.

          REMMINGTON (CONT'D)
          We control the only transponder
          foundry in the world outside of
          Mushi Motors in Taiobi.
          The window suddenly turns into a mirror.

          REMMINGTON (CONT'D)
          Oops. Sorry. Trade Secrets.

          INT. TRAMWAY

          The cart arrives at an elevator station, and the driver
          presses a signal control the doors opening immediately.

          INT. ELEVATOR

          The driver punches in a floor and door direction code
          (north, south, east, west) and the elevator begins to
          rise while the dais in the floor begins to spin aligning
          them with a different door.

          

          

          

          

          36.

          CONTINUED:

          REMMINGTON
          Now, I'll take you up to the Team
          Remmington training facility.
          The west door opens and the cart glides out into a new
          tramway which is not as industrial feeling as the first
          one, decorated with a vinyl wainscotting and slightly up-
          graded lights.
          The higher you go in the Remmington Tower, the nicer the
          halls are decorated.

          INT. TRAINING AQUARIUM

          The cart glides by a series of windows that reveal the
          rigorous training systems invented to test the drivers.
          The first is a multi-level, state-of-the-art fitness
          facility in which the far wall again looks out into
          Cosmopolis. Beyond the standard health club fare, there
          is a Martial Arts gymnastics group in a standing pyramid.
          There is also a range of strange devices ranging from the
          retro steamer boxes, medicine balls and vibrating belts
          to the hyper-modern triple axis gyro harness.

          REMMINGTON
          As you know, a T-180 driver's got
          to be in peak physical condition.
          Across from the gym is a smaller window where the typical
          anaerobic test is being conducted on a female driver. She
          is running on a treadmill with lost of wires hooked up to
          her while several doctors not their approval at the read-
          outs.

          REMMINGTON (CONT'D)
          No expense is spared to make sure
          that when our driver's suit up
          they are as perfectly tuned as the
          machines they are controlling.
          The next window is a massive centrifuge; a huge
          mechanical arm whipping around a small capsule that
          blasts past the window.

          REMMINGTON (CONT'D)
          The best driver must be able to
          withstand over 4-Gs of force in a
          typical race.

          

          

          

          

          37.

          CONTINUED:
          On the opposite wall is the vibration chamber. A man is
          strapped to a chair that is vibrating so hard you expect
          his eyeballs to rattle out.
          The next window is an underwater tank where a man is
          driving in a mock up cockpit, executing peddle maneuvers
          and gear shifts.

          REMINGTON (CONT'D)
          The will to win is nothing without
          the will to prepare and at Team
          Remmington we prepare our drivers
          for any eventuality and every
          possible condition.
          The final window is the weather chamber where a driver is
          again in a mock cockpit, blue-lipped and shivering while
          snow and wind buffet him.

          INT. ELEVATOR

          The doors open and the craft glides in.

          REMMINGTON
          I hope I didn't care you, Speed
          with how hard we push our team. I
          just wanted you to see how serious
          we are committed to winning.

          SPEED
          I get that.

          REMMINGTON
          Good. But also understand that
          R.I. Isn't all work and no play.
          The door opens revealing the Drivers' Club.

          INT. DRIVERS' CLUB

          A swanky Playboy-style casino club where, stylishly
          dressed male and female drivers are catered to by
          beautiful male and female "hostesses."
          Sprittle's eyes almost pop out.

          SPRITTLE
          That's Cannonball Taylor!
          Speed urns and sees the Captain of the Remmington Team.

          Stop the cart. Jack! Jack, come
          here. There's someone I want you
          to meet.
          Cannonball saunters over, wearing his two goiter-sized,
          diamond-encrusted champion rings.

          REMMINGTON (CONT'D)
          Speed Racer allow me to introduce
          two-time Grand Prix Winner, five
          time WRL Champion and future Hall
          of Famer, Jack Cannonball Taylor.

          SPEED
          Honor to meet you.

          CANONBALL
          Caught that Thunderhead replay.
          Nice piece of work.

          SPEED
          Wow, thanks.

          CANONBALL
          There was a rumor you might be
          visiting.

          SPEED
          It's pretty impressive.

          CANONBALL
          Only thing I cared about was that
          wall over there.
          He gestures to a special wall fitted with the trophies
          and medals won by team Remmington through the years.

          CANONBALL (CONT'D)
          That' what sold me. You want to
          win in this league, you're talking
          to the right guy.
          Remmington beams.

          REMMINGTON
          Thanks, Jack.
          Jack nods and the cart pulls away but not before Jack
          shoots a backward glance at Speed that feels like a shank
          in a prison yard.

          

          

          

          

          39.

          INT. PENTHOUSE

          The doors open and Remmington leads the family into the
          penthouse suite leaving the cart behind. Standard jaw-
          dropping view, decorated in an upscale masculine
          aesthetic.
          Sparky whistles and whispers to Speed.

          SPARKY
          Long way from Nob Hill, eh?

          REMMINGTON
          We treat our thoroughbreds the way
          they deserve to be treated.
          He guides them into the room gesturing or demonstrating
          all of the amenities.

          REMMINGTON (CONT'D)
          There's full maid service of
          course with a personal chef and a
          masseuse available 24/7.
          The staff arrives, wheeling in several racks of clothes:
          daywear, sportswear, racing uniforms and stylish evening
          wear.
          Gennie holds up one of the suit to Speed.

          GENNIE
          Should be perfect. Try it on.

          TRIXIE
          Mmm hmm!

          SPEED
          .okay.
          He heads to the bathroom.
          Taking Mom by the elbow, Remmington gestures to the
          sitting area over-looking Cosmopolis.

          REMMINGTON
          So Mrs. Racer, what do you think
          about my family? Impressed?

          MOM
          You could say that.

          

          

          

          

          40.

          CONTINUED:

          REMMINGTON
          Good. I want you to understand the
          possibilities that exist for your
          son right now.
          Pops furrows his brow.

          REMMINGTON (CONT'D)
          What's wrong Mr. Racer?

          POPS
          To be honest, Remmington, I'm
          feeling more intimidated than
          impressed. This kind of company
          scares me. People like you have
          way too much money and when
          someone has this kind of money,
          they start thinking that the rules
          everyone else is playing by don't
          mean squat to them.
          Remmington remains skillfully unfazed.

          POPS (CONT'D)
          However, my sons are the most
          important thing I've ever done in
          my life, besides marrying my best
          friend and if Speed wants us to
          figure out some kind of...
          "alliance" then you can bet your
          ass we'll be in business.
          Speed steps out of the bathroom. His boyishness has faded
          away as he suddenly seems very much a man. Gennie smile
          approvingly.

          TRIXIE
          Hubba hubba.
          He walks over to the sitting area.

          MOM
          Oh honey, you looks so handsome.

          SPEED
          Yeah?

          REMMINGTON
          Very sharp, Speed. Suits you
          perfectly. Regardless of what
          happens, I want you to have all of
          it. A gift.

          SPEED
          Thanks, Mr. Remmington.

          REMMINGTON
          So, how are you feeling Speed?
          Speed isn't sure. He looks at Trixie and Sparky and then
          at his parents.

          SPEED
          It's very... impressive.
          Remmington smiles.

          REMMINGTON
          You think that maybe there's
          something that could work out
          here?
          Everyone waits, staring at him.

          SPEED
          I guess I'd like to think about
          it, if I .could.

          Remmington's a fisherman not sure if the hook
          been set.

          REMMINGTON
          This isn't the kind of offer I go
          around making ever day, son.

          SPEED
          I understand that, sir...
          He looks to Pops then takes a deep breath as though
          trying to find his resolve.

          SPEED (CONT'D)
          So if I had to give an answer now
          then, to be honest--

          REMMINGTON
          Stop. Right there. You're right.
          You should think about it. I'm
          sure you're feeling a bit
          overwhelmed. You should take a
          little time. Think about what you
          saw and heard here and we'll get
          together early next week. Deal?
          He reaches his hand out and Speed takes it with some
          obvious relief.

          WHACK! WHACK! WHACK! A thug soundly slaps the face ofa
          handsome Japanese man.
          When the beating is over, the Japanese man slumps
          forward, his arms behind his back.

          CRUNCHER
          Ithought we had a deal...
          When he hears the voice, he lifts his head and we see a
          huge man with a body like a cement-lined safe, sitting
          behind a desk, lighting a cigar.
          This well-dressed fixer is Cruncher Block.

          CRUNCHER (CONT'D)
          I thought we were friends.
          He blows a cloud of smoke and watches it float up to the
          chandelier which is jiggling steadily.

          CRUNCHER (CONT'D)
          Maybe where you come from, this is
          how you treat your friends, but
          'round here we don't take to
          kindly to this kind of thing, do
          we fellas?
          Thug #1 steps in and wails away on him again.

          You hurt our feelings!

          CRUNCHER
          Problem is, I like you Katsu.
          Cruncher grins, his teeth like stacked dice.

          CRUNCHER (CONT'D)
          And I got a real soft spot in my
          heart for that sister of yours.

          behind the desk.

          I think I got another solution..
          He dips the bloody meat into the tank filled with
          piranha. The water foams as the carnivorous fish shred
          flesh from bone.

          Gonna be hard to drive with
          skellie hands.

          and next time it's your sister
          going in there.

          They begin forcing his hand into the tank when suddenly
          red light begins flashing.

          Cruncher signals to the man at the far end of the room
          who is guarding the door. The guard slides open a peek-a-
          boo slot and sees a pair of headlights.

          CRUNCHER
          is it him?

          DOOR GUARD
          It could be.
          Cruncher goes to the phone.

          Here he comes--
          The car pulls up even with the cab and the driver feels
          his gut clench as he recognizes the infamous car of Racer

          chair. Filling their fists with guns, sliding open murder
          holes slots at a variety of heights. Cruncher barks into

          Cruncher, hits another button and he front grill of the
          truck opens, dropping the lower half like the double-
          hinged jaw of a snake.
          An Apache helicopter-style rocket launcher thrusts out of
          the darkness.
          Cruncher sights the car.

          CRUNCHER
          Gotcha.
          He fires a mini-rocket straight at the manta-finned car--
          But with a quick feint left the rocket skims by,
          exploding further down the highway.
          Something flashes on the back car as hidden tubes iris
          open and the barrels of several weapons extend out.

          TRUCK DRIVER
          Here he comes!
          Cruncher fires again, the red rocket just missing,
          rending open the tree line with a fireball.

          The little car drops back alongside the truck and fires,
          bullets bursting tires and puncturing through the walls
          of the truck. The truck lurches as the thugs fire wildly
          at the black car.
          Cruncher tries to site the machine gun but just as he
          opens fire--
          The black car slows, drawing the chasing gun fire until
          Cruncher shoots his own tires.

          CRUNCHER
          Aww, I thought you fixed that!
          The black car fires again, bullets ricocheting inside,
          puncturing a hole in the fish tank.

          THUG #1
          Boss!

          CRUNCHER
          My babies!
          He runs to the fish tank and tries to stop the water
          pouring out of the hole. He sticks his finger in and the
          fish immediately attack.
          He shrieks withdrawing his finger.

          CRUNCHER (CONT'D)
          Vinny put your finger in there!
          Vinny doesn't want to.

          CRUNCHER (CONT'D)

          The truck slows, easing onto the shoulder as the black
          car follows.
          The back of the truck slides up and the gangsters toss
          Katsu out, leaving him behind with a spray of gravel.
          Katsu looks up into the glaring lights of the black car.
          A car door opens. Boots crunch gravel as someone walks
          toward us silhouetted by car lights. It is the masked
          racer himself---

          Thank you. You saved my life.

          RACER X
          I didn't save anything worth
          saving unless you get smart. Real
          fast.
          Racer talks without looking at him.

          RACER X (CONT'D)
          You thought you could take on the
          Cartel. You can't. Not without
          help.

          KATSU
          I don't know what'you're talking
          about.

          RACER X
          You won the Cortex Invitational
          and you weren't supposed to. You
          did it to save Okamoto
          Engineering.

          And now someone else wants it. The
          only way you can stop it from
          happening is to talk to the
          authorities.

          KATSU
          There is nothing to talk about.

          RACER X
          You have been on cruncher Block's
          leash for.so long maybe you forgot
          how it feels to stand up and be a
          man. The only way you'll ever stop
          these people is to bring them to
          justice.

          KATSU
          Justice/ That's a commodity I
          don't waste money on.
          Racer X immediately pulls his car over.

          RACER X
          Get out.
          Wearing his smirk like a cheap suit, Katsu gets out.

          KATSU
          I'll see you at Fuji.

          RACER X
          You won't finish. When you lose,
          if you can still dial a phone,
          call this number.

          as broken glass.

          REMMINGTON
           The new GRX has a super charged
           inner-positive transporter and
           will be capable of speeds in
           excess off 800 kilometers an hour.
          Mushi nods.

          MUSHI
          If such a car were to win the
          Grand Prix this year, one would
          expect the demand for transponders
          to increase dramatically.

          REMMINGTON
          One would expect.

          MUSHI
          And if a single company gained
          control of all the transponder
          foundries in the world, one might
          expect that company to do very
          well for itself.

          REMMINGTON
          You know what I want and I know
          that for the last few years you
          have been trying to buy out your

          It is important. You gotta win if
          you want to keep driving and that's
          what I want to do. It's the only
          thing I really know how to do. When

          Sometimes around your family, you
          seem distant, not like this and I
          wonder why.

          Come on, you know how I've felt
          about you since I was ten years
          old.

          TRIXIE
          I guess so, I just wish you
          weren't so shy about it.

          What do you want me to do? Kiss
          you in front of everyone at the

          Water? Bubbly? A shot of rye?

          SPEED
          No... I'm okay.

          REMMINGTON
          So, I can see you have given some
          serious thought to this thing.

          SPEED
          I have, yes sir.

          REMMINGTON
          Good. That means that you
          understand that we are talking
          about not just your future, but
          your family's future.

          SPEED
          .my family means a lot to me.

          REMMINGTON
          I know. I can tell. That's why
          this is so important. Because you
          can help them. All you have to say
          is yes. That is all I need to hear
          and I can make so many things
          happen for you, and your family.

          SPEED
          This isn't an easy decision for
          me, Mr. Remmington. For my family,
          racing is everything. We eat,
          drink, think and breathe racing.
          There is nothing more perfect than
          a picnic at Thunderhead. I mean, I
          was taught to drive before I could
          walk. But when my brother died,
          all that went away. I can't tell
          you how painful that was. It
          nearly killed all of us.
          Especially Pops. He didn't set
          foot in his shop for over a year.
          As the memory comes to life, we see the images in flashback.

          But one night when I was still
          pretty young. I couldn't sleep and
          I went into the living room and
          there was Pops, in his beat up
          robe, watching some old race
          recordings.
          The blue tv light of Speed's memory fills his eyes.

          SPEED (CONT'D)
          So I sat with him watching of Ben
          Burns coming round the last turn
          of he '43 Prix and all of a sudden
          Pops started screaming, and then I
          started screaming, and as Burns
          and Dugazi duked it out, heading
          for the finish, we were cheering
          our heads off and the second the
          black and white came down, we
          looked at each other and right
          there we realized the naked truth;
          racing is in our blood.
          Flashback ends.

          SPEED (CONT'D)
          But for Pops, it isn't just a
          sport. It's way more important
          than that. It's like a religion
          and in our house, the Major
          Sponsors are kinda like the devil.
          The coldness in Remmington's eyes belies his smile.

          SPEED (CONT'D)
          I don't mean to offend you sir and
          I do appreciate your offer, it's

          For all intensive purposes they

          Interesting that you and your

          Prix. One of the great finishes in
          the history of racing, right?
          Everyone remembers Burns and
          Dugazi slugging it out, but who
          remembers Carl Potts? Driving a
          rebuilt Wittigan for Iodyne .
          Industries, Potts spun out in the
          second lap and went down as a DNF.
          A forgettable and pathetic finish.
          So bad, that afterwards Iodyne
          stock dropped six points.
          Again we see the history told in flashback.

          REMMINGTON (CONT'D)
          Meanwhile, Ben Burns sat guzzling
          cold fresh milk in victory lane, a
          thousand cameras taking his
          picture, Sirrus Aeronautics saw
          almost a twelve point gain which
          immediately block Penninsula Power
          Cell from being able to afford the
          price of a complete take-over.
          This put Joel Goldman, the CEO of
          Iodyne Inc. in the exact position
          he wanted to be in. By first
          buying controlling interest in his
          own company at a devalued price,
          he then brokered a merger with
          Sirrus that immediately sent
          Iodyne into the gains record book--
          the only record book that matters.
          Look out that window, there isn't
          a single plane or helicopter or K-
          Harrier that isn't powered by
          Iodyne fuel cells. That's what
          racing is about. It has nothing to
          do with cars, or drivers. All that
          matters is power and the
          unassailable might of money.
          His greed is as tangible as any drug.

          Remmington is far from done.

          REMMINGTON
          Do you understand? Burns knew he
          was going to win. It was already
          decided. A week before the Prix,
          Goldman and Sirrus met with
          several other major players at the
          Carlyle Hotel. They met there as
          they had for years, just as their
          fathers had met, and as their sons
          and heirs will still meet. They
          met to negotiate the finish order
          of the Grand Prix. No race is more
          important and no race is more
          controlled. That year Goldman was
          supposed to win, but he knew if he
          sold his win to Sirrus, whatever
          that win might be worth, was
          nothing compared to what could be
          gained.
          He turns back to the twisted piece of crash metal.

          That's why I paid three million
          dollars for this burnt and twisted
          piece of metal. Because it reminds
          me of what really matters. This is
          the true heart of racing boy! This
          is my religion!
          Speed is aghast.

          Within a year he will be filing
          for bankruptcy. After that, you
          and the rest of your pathetic
          family will be history.
          The threat hangs in the air like a loaded gun between
          them.

          SPEED
          Pops was right. You are the devil.
          The elevator suddenly opens with the security goon
          carrying Sprittle and Chim-chim by the scruff of their
          necks.

          SPRITTLE
          Speed!

          SPEED
          Sprittle?

          Mr. Remmington I caught these two

          crushing the life out of him.

          It'll be okay. We'll get through
          it.

          terrible man.

          SPEED
          But maybe racing isn't about being
          happy. Maybe Remmington's right
          and it's all about business and
          anyone who doesn't understand that
          is just a chump.

          MOM
          Now you listen to me, young man.
          What you do behind the wheel of a
          racecar has nothing to do with
          business. Before you could even
          talk, you were making noises that
          sounded like a car engine. We
          used to tell people you were
          speaking car-ese. We used to try
          to take you to the park but you
          never wanted to get out of the
          car.

          SPEED
          .I loved that old wagon.

          MOM
          And do you remember the time Rex
          took you out to Thunderhead and
          let you drive--
          Speed smiles.

          SPEED
          And I turned it over.

          MOM
          My heart still pounds just
          thinking about it.

          SPEED
          Rex told me the only reason we
          survived was because I was wearing
          red socks.

          MOM
          I thought your father was going to
          have a stroke when you walked in

          black gap where his two front teeth should be.

          MOM
          I don't think I ever saw you as
          happy as you were telling anybody
          who asked, how you lost your two
          front teeth in your first crash.

          INT. SPEED'S ROOM - PRESENT


          MOM
          Speed, when I watch you do some of
          the things you do, I feel like I'm
          watching someone paint or play
          music. When I go to the races, I
          go to watch you make art and it's
          beautiful and inspiring and
          everything that art should be,
          even though there are times when I
          have to close my eyes. But then
          there are other times, when you
          just take my breath away and it's
          at those moments, when I feel your
          father's chest swell and I know
          he's smiling, trying to pretend he
          doesn't have tears in his eyes, I
          just go to pieces.

          SPEED
          Why?

          MOM
          Because I am so impossibly proud
          to be your mother. And even
          though your father doesn't say it,
          he is too.
          She puts her arms around him.

          Don't worry. We'll figure this

          years for dozens of capital
          corporate crimes including WRL
          fixing but we haven't had the
          evidence we need to convict him.

          SPRITTLE
          What's he doing here?

          INSPECTOR DETECTOR
          Racer X works closely with our WRL
          corporate crimes division, helping
          us recruit drivers like you,
          Speed. Most of the media, which
          you are now seeing is controlled
          by the Major Sponsors and they
          have done their best to paint him
          as a menace to the sport. The
          truth is he's our most valuable
          weapon against these villains.

          of the most vicious Fixers in the
          world.
          Gulp. They both sink back down behind the couch.

          SPEED
          What do you want with me?

          INSPECTOR DETECTOR
          You're familiar with the driver
          Katsu Okamoto?

          SPEED
          Of course.

          INSPECTOR DETECTOR
          For years he has been contracted
          by a Fixer named Cruncher Block
          who we know works for Remmington.
          Recently, Katsu has been forced to
          lose races that have led to a
          droop in the stock price of
          Okamoto Engineering. We believe
          this is a part of a corporate
          strategy to allow Mushi motors to
          buy control of Okamoto. Katsu
          doesn't want this to happen and he
          began resisting, thinking.that he
          could do it on his own. After
          Fuji, he realized he needed help.

          POPS
          ,Why help him?

          INSPECTOR DETECTOR
          Because he has a file with enough
          information to connect Block to
          Remmington which could put both of
          them behind bars for the rest of
          their lives. The problem is, he
          won't give us the file unless we
          help him stop the take over of his
          family's company.

          SPEED
          How?

          INSPECTOR DETECTOR
          There is an up-coming race that
          Katsu believes if he can win, it
          will catapult Okamoto Engineering
          back into the spotlight and double
          the cost of the buy out which
          should kill it.

          SPEED
          But there aren't any more races
          left except for the Grand Prix and
          we both failed to qualify.
          Inspector takes a big breath.

          INSPECTOR DETECTOR
          There aren't any track races.
          This is a cross-country rally.

          What?!

          INSPECTOR DETECTOR
          I know it seems cruel of me to
          ask, but Katsu made it clear that
          he had to have Speed an X on his
          team or there would be no deal.

          POPS
          Absolutely out of the question.

          INSPECTOR DETECTOR
          You'll have the support of the
          entire C.I.B--

          POPS
          No! Rally racing is a back alley

          ANNOUNCER
          We're just minutes away from the
          start of the 82nd annual Casa
          Cristo Classic, the grand dame of
          cross-country, the second oldest
          rally race in the world, spanning
          two continents, three climate
          changes and five thousand
          kilometers of the most winding and
          treacherous roads ever raced.

          INT. CASA CRISTO BLIMP


          ANNOUNCER
          Safety has been the primary
          concern for Casa Cristo officials,
          especially the last few years.

          JOHNNY
          That's right Bob. There were a
          number of fatalities several years
          ago. It really had a bad
          reputation for a while.

          ANNOUNCER
          Fans started calling it "The
          Crucible."

          JOHNNY
          Most of the T-180 drivers wouldn't
          come near it.

          ANNOUNCER
          But you look today, we've got some
          major names like Millie "the
          mouse" Manno, Snake Oiler and
          Katsu Okamoto as well as the young
          rising star Speed Racer. Not to
          mention, the shadow that seems to
          hang over every major race these
          days, the masked racer that some
          fans call the Harbinger of Boom.
          What's your take on Racer X?

          Obviously he is an extremely

          ANNOUNCER
          But is he a head hunter?

          JOHNNY
          I think he drives like he'is not
          always interested in winning.

          ANNOUNCER
          Nuff' said.

          JOHNNY
          But remember Colton, these are
          standard road cars, not T-180s. I
          know a lot of T-180 drivers who I
          raced against who expected to win
          but found out racing a few laps on
          a track is a totally different
          animal than a cross-country rally.

          ANNOUNCER
          The marathon as opposed to the
          sprint?

          JOHNNY
          Exactly. This isn't just about
          going fast. It's about endurance.
          More than anything, winning Casa
          Cristo is a test of will.

          ANNOUNCER
          The reason.T-180 drivers have
          always come to Casa Cristo is
          because the winner is
          automatically offered an
          invitation to the Grand Prix next
          week. A hold over from the days
          when rally racing was far more

          He ignores her, turning away as she starts to open it.

          A red bearded driver named Billy Steel-belted, his team
          covered in the Manecks' logo, begins sliding up next to
          Speed.

          

          

          

          

          91.

          EXT. SQUARE

          A cobra peeks his head out of a basket, charmed by a
          gorgeous woman playing her flute.
          In the audience, Cruncher moves up behind Billy.
          He hands him a small black velvet bag.
          Billy pours out a fistful of star-dust; the glint of
          diamonds glitter in the greed of his smile.

          EXT. ZUNUBIAN DESERT

          Billy smiles revealing his diamond studded teeth then
          swerves at Speed.

          INT. HELICOPTER

          Trixie sees the attack coming.

          TRIXIE
          Speed, jump!

          INT. MACH 5

          Speed does, just as Billy's car plows through, passing
          under him.

          RACER X
          He's not alone.

          EXT. ZUNUBIAN DESERT

          The Manecks team attacks, their cars flying at Katsu even
          as a second team, the Atomic Injectables led by Tyrus
          Tropp also attacks.

          RACER X
          This surprises me.

          SPEED
          Why?

          RACER X
          Tyrus is a good man. I wouldn't
          expect him to turn head-hunter.
          They aren't pulling any punches.

          

          

          

          

          92.

          INT. BASEMENT

          Cruncher sits, shadows drawn around him like the folded
          wings of a bat, across from a stoic looking Tyrus.
          Cruncher slides an envelope across the table.
          Tyrus looks at the goons surrounding him, then picks it
          up.
          Inside are the photographs of a beautiful girl playing in
          a park. The hard edge in Tyrus' expression immediately
          softens turning to fear.
          Cruncher smiles like a snake that has just found an egg.

          INT. CASA CRISTO BLIMP


          ANNOUNCER
          Things have started heating up, as
          the cars head out across the
          desert flats.

          EXT. DESERT FLATS

          The swerving, weaving chain of cars churns up a massive
          cloud of dust in their wake.
          Attacking cars are caught and spun out by Racer X and
          Speed.
          A hurricane of sand and dirt swirl around Katsu who sits
          calmly in the eye of the storm while-
          His guardian angels go into overdrive.
          Racer X and Speed seem like they have been driving
          together all their lives.

          RACER X
          Lead him--

          SPEED
          Here ya go!
          Speed leads an attack straight into Racer X's counter.

          RACER X
          Wing left.

          SPEED
          Flying in!

          

          

          

          

          93.

          CONTINUED:
          He jumps one car and blocks the attack on X.
          As their cars merge in.and out from one another,
          something seems perfectly clear to Speed--
          He is back at Thunderhead with the ghost of his brother,
          dancing around each other until--

          TRIXIE
          Speed!
          Wham! Billy slams up against him--
          Throwing a lever, a grappler locks on to the Mach 5.

          SPEED
          He's got me! I'm locked up!
          Another lever is pumped like a tire pump and a sheaved
          blade begins stabbing at Speed's tires.
          Racer X watches unable to leave Katsu unprotected.
          Speed hits the D button and the zircon saw blades start
          gliding through the grappler.

          RACER X
          Get out of there! -

          SPEED
          I'm trying!
          The knife slashes the tire which explodes just as the
          grappler is cut--
          Speed flips away free, hitting the "C" button causing a
          new tire to inflate while he's upside down--
          Landing on a new tire, without missing a beat.
          Tyrus rushes into the opening, but this time it's Katsue
          who works a hidden lever and--
          A Katana-like blade flashes, a samurai slash across the
          front tire--
          Bowing it out, flipping the entire car, which tumbles
          back straight at Speed, forcing him to try a split-jack

          JUMP--
          Firing only the rear jump-jacks, launching the back end
          of the car while--

          

          

          

          

          94.

          CONTINUED: (2)
          The front end of the Mach 5 clips against the Atomic
          Injectibles car--
          Sending Speed flipping end over end but landing with
          strangely beautiful grace.

          Sprittle and Chim-chim are laying in lounge chairs
          wearing bathing suits and tanning goggles, holding
          tanning mirrors under their chins.
          Pops walks up.

          POPS
          I've got to go into town for some
          parts. I'll be back for lunch.

          SPRITTLE

          Pops looks at them, shakes his head and walks off.

          Sprittle slowly lowers his tanning goggles to watch
          go.

          SPRITTLE (CONT'D)

          They're back with chips and cokes clicking on the tv as
          the cars storm across the desert.
          They start crunching away, oblivious to the sound of the
          front door opening.

          POPS (CONT'D)
          Sprittle!
          He sees the race on tv.

          Wait! Pops, before you get mad at
          us--Look!
          Sprittle points at the tv eyes wide.

          POPS
          I'm not falling for that--

          SPRITTLE
          It's Speed!

          POPS
          Speed's skiing.

          SPRITTLE
          Then who's driving the Mach 5?
          Pops turns and indeed, there's the Mach 5 barrelling
          across the red baked earth of Zunubia.

          KATSU
          If we drive tomorrow like we drove
          today we will lose!
          He points at the masked racer.

          KATSU (CONT'D)
          You will get nothing! All of this
          will be meaningless!

          SPEED
          Relax. Snake's weak on turns.
          We'll catch him in the mountains.

          KATSU
          We might if you stop showing off.

          SPEED
          Hey, all I was doing was saving
          your ass.
          Katsu raises a fist, but Racer X catches it.

          immediately enveloped by his security team.
          Speed looks at Racer X as though he can suddenly see
          through the mask.

          RACER X (CONT'D)
          A C.I.B. Man will be posted
          outside your door. We got their
          attention today. You and Trixie

          He stops.

          SPEED (CONT'D)
          I thought we made a good team
          today. It felt like we'd been
          doing it for a long time.

          Mr. Mushi--

          MUSHI
          So, is this what guarantee means
          to you, Mr. Remmington? Perhaps
          your dictionary has a different
          definition.

          REMMINGTON
          I understand there is a problem,
          but I assure you there is no need
          to panic.

          MUSHI
          I am not calling to panic. I am
          calling to inform you that we will
          be addressing the problem
          ourselves, as your assurances and
          guarantees leaves much to be

          It was very weird, Trix. I knew
          every move he was going to make
          and he knew mine. It was so
          familiar. Maybe I'm crazy but
          Racer X first showed up two years
          after Rex's death.

          TRIXIE
          But Speed, Rex was cremated.

          SPEED
          A body was cremated. Remember it
          had already been badly burned in
          the crash. Even if it was Rex, no
          one could have recognized him.

          So you think he faked the crash
          with a different body in the
          driver's seat?

          SPEED
          Somehow the kwik-save was
          disconnected. Inspector Detector
          suspected foul play but nothing
          could be proved.

          okay, let's say it's all true.
          Why would we do it?

          that make you happy?

          The sheer curtains undulate in the open window of Speed's
          room as a masked face lowers into view.
          The men of the Racer family lay scattered about the room
          in cots and on the couches. Mom and Trixie are in the
          connecting room.

          Racer X, his face shrouded in shadows, emerges from the
          darkness where all marked men sleep, behind the couch.
          The ninja realizes he's been tricked and spins just as
          Racer X attacks.

          INT. RACER HOTEL ROOM

          The syringe moves towards Speed's neck when--
          Sprittle rolls over, knocking chim-chim with his arm,
          waking him up. and as soon as he sees the ninja--
          He screams.
          Sprittle screams.
          The ninja attacks stabbing at Speed who just barely
          catches the needle. The ninja tries to wing-chun the
          hypodermic free but--
          Speed is too quick and he forces the needle into the
          headboard as--
          Sparky jumps onto the ninja's back.

          SPARKY
          I got him! I got hiiiyow--
          The ninja throws Sparky across the room and tries to bolt
          but Speed is up and throwing a quick combo.
          The ninja stumbles, but a manages a spin-kick that knocks
          Speed back as--
          Pops grabs the ninja from behind.

          POPS

          Pops cracks his knuckles.

          HORUKO

          Speed moves to the door.

          Horuko? Are you all right?

          HORUKO
          No. Something terrible has
          happened.

          Katsu can barely sit up, his arm draped over Horuko, his
          head lolling from side to side.
          The family is gathered around them and Racer X, who is
          again wearing the mask.

          the nearest cars it is immediately apparent that they are
          no longer driving protectively or defensively--

          Snake blocks him, setting up an attack by one of his team
          but this just allows Racer X a hole to punch through.
          The cars continue to slug it out still weaving up the

          force of the blow--
          And Speed loses it.
          His jaw clenches, shifting into a whole new level of
          intensity.
          He becomes a cyclone, a whirling dervish, enveloping the
          HydroCell team in a cloud of chaos---
          Throwing, rending,. ripping through them until only Snake
          is left.
          Speed is not kind; battering him until he's not sure if
          he's going forward or backward.

          Speed shakes his head, wanting this to be over.

          RACER X
          Then let's move it. We got some
          time to eat up.

          INT. HORUKO'S HELICOPTER

          Cruncher is buckled into a seat with his arms tied behind
          him. He glares at Katsu who is changing into his racing
          leathers.

          CRUNCHER
          Haven't ya heard? Cheaters never
          prosper.

          SECURITY GUARD
          Sir, we've got the lead! They're
          heading for the rendezvous, now!
          Katsu looks back at Cruncher and smiles.

          KATSU
          Excellent.

          INT. THUGMOBILE

          No answer. The thug hangs up.

          THUG
          Somethin' ain't right.

          INT. HELICOPTER

          They head down towards the rendezvous which is a hidden
          alpine nook, surrounded by mountains.

          You're sure, no cameras here?

          POPS
          Checked it this morning. Quite a
          few dead spots in these mountains.

          EXT. RENDEZVOUS

          The Okamoto team roars up to where everyone is waiting.
          Speed climbs out of the Mach-5 and heads straight for
          Trixie.

          SPEED
          I told you--
          She turns ready to fight, if that's what he wants.

          SPEED (CONT'D)
          You are one helluva driver.
          She smiles.

          TRIXIE
          You're not so bad yourself.
          Sparky and Pops go to work, changing fuel cells and
          starting to pound out some of the serious dents.
          Racer X sees Cruncher guarded by the security team.

          RACER X
          What's he doing here?

          KATSU
          Stowaway. Weren't sure what to do
          with him.

          RACER X
          Do what he'd do; break his legs
          and let him walk back.
          Horuko bows to Trixie.

          HORUKO
          Thank you so much.

          TRIXIE
          It was a blast.

          SPARKY

          They start to turn until machine gun fires objects.

          THUG
          Nobody move!
          The thugs emerge from the surrounding wood.

          POPS
          What is this?!

          UP
          He strides towards the nearest goon but bullets spit

          IN
          the earth and snow at his feet causing him to freeze
          place.

          CRUNCHER
          This is called a change of plan.
          Now freed, one of the thugs tosses him a gun.

          THUG
          Yeah, that's right. We're
          changing your plan that changed
          our plan to change your
          plan. - .right boss?
          Cruncher decides to ignore that.

          CRUNCHER
          The new plan-- what was it, again?
          Break your legs, make you.walk
          back? I like that.
          He stands smiling in front of Racer X.

          CRUNCHER (CONT'D)
          But first, I think it's time to
          play a little peek-a-boo, I-see-

          EXT. RENDEZVOUS

          One of the thugs pins Racer X's arms back as Cruncher
          goes for the mask while--
          Unnoticed by anyone, the trunk of the Mach-5 pops open
          and four eyes peek out.
          Cruncher starts to peel back the mask when a rock clips
          him on the side of his head.

          SPRITTLE
          Monkey cookie!
          He turns just as--
          Whap! A monkey cookie in the kisser.

          SPRITTLE (CONT'D)
          Nice shot!
          Chim-chim howls as Sprittle reloads his sling-shot.

          POPS
          Sprittle?!

          CRUNCHER
          Get that monkey!
          The goons are confused, distracted, and before they can
          control it, the fight is on--
          Racer X throws the thug holding him--
          Speed and Trixie dish out equal measures of chop-socky
          and good of American slug-fu as--
          Pops grapples and wrestles his goon into a head-lock.
          Racer X hammers Cruncher to the ground where he sees his
          gun, scrambling for it but just as he reaches for it--
          Katsu steps on his hand.
          It's a short quick turn around and--

          RACER X
          Looks like another change of plan.

          Sprittlel Get over here!

          SPRITTLE
          Ahhhh!
          He and Chim-chim run behind Speed.

          SPEED
          Sprittle this isn't a game. You
          could've been killed in there.

          SPRITTLE
          I.know it was bad! I know we
          shouldn't have done it. But Chim-
          chim was really really scared.

          SPEED
          Chim-chim?

          SPRITTLE
          Okay, I was a little scared too.

          TRIXIE
          Scared of what?
          Sprittle clings to his big brother.

          SPRITTLE
          I didn't want what happened to Rex
          to happen to you.
          Racer X and Pops feel a hidden wound open.

          SPRITTLE (CONT'D)
          We just thought if you got into
          trouble, maybe we could help and
          it's a good thing we did.

          point.

          easy. If your mother hasn't had a

          Whatever happened in that pass has
          left Okamoto back where they

          Moon-white sheaves mottled against coke-bottle colored
          ice floes rise up, a glistening wall of glacial plates
          surrounding the thin ribbon of road.
          Speed enters the first series of caves bored through
          earth and ice, a stroboscopic oscillation of light and
          dark, ads and no ads as---
          The memory of watching Rex disappear down the throat of
          one of these caves haunts him.

          KATSU
          Speed?! What are you doing?

          SPEED
          Sorry.

          RACER X
          Are you all right?

          SPEED
          I'm fine.
          Ahead, the HydroCell team grows from small silhouettes
          flashing in and out of sight,. closer and closer, larger
          and larger until--
          once more the three chase cars lock onto their rear
          bumper.

          Where there is no purchase for advertisements--
          Only the cold, wet darkness where white lights chase
          after red ones.
          Speed tries to shake his fear when X calls for the
          attack.

          RACER X
          Now.
          The cars split apart, Racer X leading the charge as--
          Sparks flash as with the cross of swords, metal striking
          metal and--
          The ice-crusted walls sparkle with star-bursts of

          VIOLENCE--
          The cacophony ringing through the first bending curve.
          It is obvious that the conditions are much more
          difficult, a sword fight on a frozen lake--
          Each of the drivers, skidding, wobbling, drifting farther
          then they anticipated, but--
          The Okamoto team are just too good, eliminating one and
          then the other HydroCell cars until--
          Speed again has Snake in his sights.
          This time, though, Snake is ready.

          SNAKE
          Not this time, punk!
          He throws the lever and beneath his car--
          A violent spray of freezing gas immediately skim coats
          the road with a fresh shimmering glaze of ice that---
          Speed hits going full throttle, immediately spinning
          wildly out of control.
          He screams trying to hold on as he spits out the end of
          the cave--
          Smashing through the rail, separating from the earth--
          Hanging for a moment against the soundlessness of the
          open sky--
          Before dropping like a stone.

          Speed falls and from inside the cockpit it looks
          impossibly far to the bottom but--
          The wall of the cliff is not completely vertical and the
          Mach-5 begins to rub against the ice.
          Speed reacts immediately, hitting one of the control
          buttons and--
          Crampons shoot out of his tires, giving him just enough
          of a hold to try--
          A split-jack jump, the front jacks firing, throwing the
          car into a somersault across the open ravine--
          Slamming against the far side which has slightly more
          slope, allowing the crampons to dig in as--

          winding road just behind a disbelieving Snake.

          Hi. Remember me?
          Speed roars up after him and Snake grabs for his lever
          again but now it's Speed that's ready--
          Jumping over the ice, he body slams Snake, sending him
          hard into the rail as Speed shoots into the lead.

          SNAKE
          Not again! Not again!
          He grabs at an ankle holster, yanking out a gun.

          Snake now finds himself on the outside as Speed bashes
          him out through the guard rail.
          Snake tries a similar move to Speed but Snake is no Speed-

          barely above 50! This is
          extortion! Blackmail! I'll sue
          you! Tie up every asset you own
          up for the next 20 years!

          OKAMOTO
          As you wish Mr. Remmington. Have
          a nice day.

          REMMINGTON
          Wait!
          He grinds his molars until they are smooth.

          REMMINGTON (CONT'D)
          Seventy-eight a share. I'll have
          the papers drawn up.

          OKAMOTO
          A pleasure doing business with
          you.

          INT. OKAMOTO'S OFFICE

          sit across
          Okamoto hangs up the phone. Katsu and Horuko
          from him. He smiles.

          OKAMOTO
          You have done very well for us, my
          son.
          Katsu smiles the same smile as his father. The only
          person not smiling in the room is Horuko.

          INT. RACER FAMILY GARAGE

          Speed kicks over a tool box giving voice to his rage with
          a cacophony of clattering metal.
          He jumps into the Mach 5. The engine guns the wheels
          screech as he peels out and away leaving--
          Inspector Detector standing with this hat in hand, his
          frown mirrored by Pops.

          SPARKY
          I don't get it. What just
          happened?

          POPS.
          Okamoto played us for chumps. All
          he wanted was our help to drive up
          the stock on his family's company.
          Even if there was a file, he had
          no intention of turning it over.

          SPARKY
          You mean that whole race was for
          nothing?

          INT. MACH 5

          Speed screams as loud as he can strangling the steering
          wheel as he rockets through a series of familiar with
          curves.

          EXT. THUNDERHEAD

          Without the lights or banners or crowds, the race track
          echoes with the same quiet portance as a cathedral. It
          is here that Speed has always found himself.
          But as he sails through neck snapping turns with reckless
          abandon, it becomes clear that he is chasing something
          that he has lost.
          He seems ready to cry for all the frustration and anger,
          wanting so badly to undo the last few weeks of his life.
          Suddenly in his rearview mirror there is an answer to his
          prayer, a miracle--
          His brother.

          

          

          

          

          129.

          CONTINUED:
          For a moment he believes that he is again driving beside
          the ghost of his brother but when the two cars kiss up
          against each other, Speed realizes this is no ghost--
          It's Racer X.
          The masked Racer suddenly becomes the focus of all his
          anger and Speed swings his car, wielding it like a club,
          trying to clobber him.
          Racer X dodges the first blow and swings back, the two have
          at one another, banging, shoving one another into the wall--
          Until Speed can't take it anymore and he goes at X as
          ferociously as he can, throwing him into a tailspin--
          Crashing him into one of the grand stands.
          Silence embraces the track.
          Speed climbs out of the Mach 5.

          SPEED
          X? Racer X?
          There is a small movement in the car, a shuddering as
          though in pain and Speed realizes he may have gone too
          far.

          SPEED (CONT'D)
          Racer X?!!
          He runs to the car but immediately stops when he realizes
          the masked man is not in pan; he is laughing. He
          practically falls out of his car.

          RACER X
          Jeezus, kid. You can drive. I
          haven't been thrown like that in
          years.

          SPEED
          What are you doing here?

          RACER X
          The inspector told me what
          happened., I came looking for you.

          SPEED
          Why?

          RACER X
          Thought you'd take it hard and
          maybe do something stupid.

          SPEED
          Why would you care?

          RACER X
          Because you're a fighter. And a
          friend.

          SPEED
          Why don't you just tell me the
          truth?
          Racer X stares at him hard.

          SPEED (CONT'D)
          You're Rex, aren't you?

          RACER X
          You mean your brother?

          mask.
          After a long hard moment, Racer X pulls off his
          He is not Rex. Speed is stunned.

          SPEED (CONT'D)
          You're... not Rex.

          RACER X
          No. I'm sorry Speed but your
          brother is dead.
          He pulls his mask back on.

          SPEED
          I'm sorry.

          RACER X
          Don't be. I'm sure where ever
          your brother is, he is immensely
          proud of you.

          SPEED
          For what? Making the same
          mistakes he did?

          

          

          

          

          131.

          CONTINUED: (3)

          RACER X
          For trying to make a difference.
          From what I've read, that's all he
          tried to do.

          SPEED
          And what good did it do? He got
          killed for nothing. Racing hasn't
          changed and it never will!

          RACER X
          It doesn't matter if racing never
          changes. What matters is if we
          let racing change us. Everyone of
          us has to find the reason to do
          this. You don't climb into a T-
          180 to be a driver. You do it
          because you're driven.

          SPEED
          I don't know why I'm doing it
          anymore.

          RACER X
          That's obvious. At Fuji, you were
          trying to prove something. At
          Cristo, you were looking for
          justice. Neither are the reason
          you belong behind a steering
          wheel.

          SPEED
          If you know so much, why don't you
          tell me why I should keep driving?

          RACER X
          Sorry. That's for you to figure
          out.
          He climbs back into his car.

          RACER X (CONT'D)
          I just hope when you do, I'm there.
          to see it.
          He roars away leaving Speed alone.

          INT. SPEED'S ROOM

          Speed is furiously packing. There is a knock on the door
          but he ignores it.
          Sprittle opens the door, Chim-chim following him in.

          SPRITTLE
          Why?

          SPEED
          Because.

          SPRITTLE
          Because why?

          SPEED
          Because I have to.

          SPRITTLE
          Can we come with you?
          Speed is struck by an odd sense of deja vu.

          SPEED
          What?

          SPRITTLE
          Can we come with you?

          SPEED
          No.

          You'll understand when it's your

          He shoulders his bag and shoves out the door.

          INT. RACER FAMILY LIVING ROOM

          there,
          Speed crosses to the door but Pops is already
          sitting, waiting, a heaviness in his.limbs.

          POPS
          Speed, before you go, I'd like to
          say a few things. Will you sit
          with your old man for a minute?
          Speed chafes a bit but drops his bag.

          SPEED
          Don't try to stop me.

          POPS
          I won't. I made a mistake trying
          to tell you what to do at Cortega.
          You were right. I was wrong. I
          won't make that mistake again.
          Speed sits.

          POPS (CONT'D)
          I want you to know that I acted
          rashly. I said things I wish I
          hadn't. Your mother usually
          protects me from making an ass out
          of my self but I was determined to
          do it this time and I guess I did
          a pretty good job of it. I wanted
          to make sure you understood how
          sorry I was.

          SPEED
          Thanks.

          POPS
          The truth was, I couldn't have
          been more proud of you son. Not
          because you won, but because you
          stood up, you weren't afraid and
          you did what you thought was
          right.

          SPEED
          So? It didn't amount to anything.
          It was completely meaningless.

          POPS
          How could it be meaningless? I
          saw my son become a man. I
          watched him act with courage and
          integrity and drive the pants off
          of every driver on the road. This
          is not meaningless. This is the
          reason for a father's life.
          Pop's eyes'begin to twinkle with tears

          

          

          

          

          134.

          CONTINUED: (2)

          POPS (CONT'D)
          I admit I went to Cortega because
          I was afraid that what happened to
          Rex was going to happen to you.
          And I just couldn't take that. I
          couldn't loose another one of my
          boys like that again. But what I
          realize in Cortega was that I
          didn't lose Rex when he crashed, I
          lost him here. I lost him when he
          walked out of this house and I let
          him go without telling him how
          proud I was of him and how much I
          loved him. I let him think that a
          stupid motor company meant more to
          me than he did. You'll never know
          how much I regret that mistake,
          but it's enough that I'll never
          make it again.
          He puts his big bear arms around him and hugs him.

          POPS (CONT'D)
          I love you Speed. I understand that
          every child leaves home but I want
          you to know that door is always
          open and you can always come back.

          SPEED
          I love you Pops. I'm just so
          confused right now. I don't what
          I'm doing or why I'm doing it. I'm
          locked up in some kinda tailspin
          and no direction makes sense.

          POPS
          I know what that's like. When Rex
          died I didn't even. know if I
          wanted salt on my eggs, let alone
          if I wanted to keep building cars.
          Then, do you remember when we sat
          here, that night, watching old Ben
          Burns and Dugazi? You remember
          that?
          Speednods vaguely.

          POPS (CONT'D)
          Sittin' here, cheering with you,
          something just clicked, like a
          light being switched on inside of
          me and after that, I never had
          trouble remembering how I liked me
          eggs.

          Jeez Pops. That's just it.
          That's part of my problem.

          POPS
          What?

          SPEED
          That race. The '43 Prix. Burns
          and Dugazi? It was fixed.
          Remmington told me the whole
          story. It was all about some DNF
          names Rotts. They've known the
          winner of every Grand Prix for the
          past 50 years. It's always fixed.
          That's a tough pill for Pops to swallow.

          POPS
          I don't believe that.
          Remmington's a crook. You can't
          believe a crook.

          SPEED
          I don't think he was lying, Pops.

          POPS
          The Grand Prix? A sham?
          Ding dong.

          HORUKO
          Forgive me for intruding but I had
          to come before it was too late.
          Speed eyes her for a moment wondering if this is another
          set-up.

          HORUKO (CONT'D)
          This is not a trick. I swear to
          you. I am not my brother.

          suburban living room.

          POPS
          Can I get you something to drink?

          HORUKO
          No. My security man believes I am
          still at the opera, so I only have
          a moment.
          She turns to Speed.

           HORUKO (CONT'D)
          I am very sorry for what happened.
          what my father and brother did was
          not right and I am ashamed.

          SPEED
          It's fine. Just another lesson
          learned.

          HORUKO
          No.. It is they who are in need of
          a lesson.
          She pulls an envelope out of her bag and gives it to
          Speed.

          HORUKO (CONT'D)
          This rightfully belongs to you.
          He opens the envelope and his eyes immediately light up.

          SPEED
          An invitation to compete in the
          91st annual Grand Prix?

          HORUKO
          My brother was planning to decline
          anyway but I studied the rules
          very carefully and as a member of
          the Okamoto team, if you present
          this invitation on the day of the
          race, they must allow you to
          compete.
          Pops bursts into a smile and slaps Speed on the back.

          HORUKO
          You do not have to say anything.
          I only hope you drive as you did
          in Casa Cristo and you wipe the
          smiles from their faces.

          POPS

          Behind him the entire family peeks out.

          Try to stop it and you'll be in
          blatant violation of the WRL
          charter, leaving me no option but
          to shut this years Prix down until

          A car to the side swerves aiming straight at Speed who
          manages at the last second a slip-jack jump--
          Flipping over the car as it slams into the pile-up while--
          Speed guns his engine in the air so that when he hits the
          track there is a scream of burning rubber and the Mach 5
          rockets out of the start to the cheering crowd.

          That-kid's wiley.

          EXT. GRAND PRIX TRACK

          The first lap of the Grand Prix is Ben Hur brutal as car
          after car takes a shot at Speed but--
          He uses their aggressiveness throwing them into each other--
          Littering the track with flaming debris and bouncing
          cocoons.

          INT. GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCER'S BOOTH

          They try to keep up but Speed is even too fast for them.

          Speed fakes left, jumps right--

          Speed executes another beautiful maneuver sending Gearbox
          crashing into Boom-Boom--
          Both cars going boom-boom, their rubber cocoons bouncing
          free.

          CASS JONES
          Speed Racer seems unstoppable,
          moving up from dead last, nearing
          the leaders as they head into the
          slalom with the Gray Ghost
          battling Prince Kabala and
          Cannonball Taylor for the lead.

          EXT. GRAND PRIX TRACK

          The Prince tries to sight the Ghost in his mirrors but
          the Gray Ghost seems to vanish.

          GRAY GHOST
          Where am I? Where am I? I'm
          here. I am over there. I'm
          Savior Faire!
          The Prince tries to block the Ghost but he can't seem to
          locate him.

          GRAY GHOST (CONT'D)
          I'm everywhere, baby!
          Wham! The Ghost is on him, pouncing, slipping into what
          feels like a shoulder throw that sends the Prince
          spinning out of control onto the onrushing Nitro--
          Shattering the Prince's car like a mis-struck diamond
          reduced in one hammer stroke to twinkling dust.

          worth an estimated 22 million
          dollars is scattered over a
          quarter mile of track.

          BEN BURNS
          I'd like to work clean up on that
          crash.
          They chuckle.

          But look out, as they approach the
          Big Drop, here comes Speed Racer?

          EXT. THE BIG DROP

          The cars head over as though falling off the end of
          Niagara and while other drivers cling to their steering
          wheels just trying to hang on--
          Speed presses the accelerator, making his move--
          Banking higher than anyone up the big wall and when he
          dives back down there are only three cars left ahead of

          HIM--
          The green Mushi motors car, the Gray Ghost, and the Black

          GRX.

          EXT. GRAND PRIX TRACK

          Speed makes a move and Cannonball blocks, but it is
          clumsy and Speed quickly counters--
          Bouncing Cannonball into the wall.

          SPEED
          Come on! Is that it?
          He swerves back and the two cars begin to battle but it
          is immediately clear who is the better driver, as--
          Speed throws Cannonball from one side of the track to the
          other.

          Speed slides into Cannonball to throw him but as he does--

          

          

          

          

          154.

          Cannonball throws a hidden switch and under the two cars
          a spear hook shoots out and locks onto the Mach 5
          undercarriage.
          Speed feels it and knows what happened immediately.

          SPEED (CONT'D)
          No!

          Cannonball slows driving both cars into the wall,
          grinding against the Mach 5 while the trailing cars shoot
          post.

          They exit the butterfly turn and head into the slalom,
          both drivers fighting hard to force the other into the
          onrushing concrete pylons.
          The paint is scraped first from the outside of the Mach 5
          and then the GRX as they barely avoid one pylon and then
          another, neither car gaining an advantage until--
          The Mach 5 begins to rattle, the stronger GRX taking
          advantage as they head for the final pylon---
          Where the camera that is broadcasting the two cars onto

          causing both cars to rise up onto the two outside wheels
          of the GRX--
          Revealing the undercarriage and the hidden spear hook to
          the camera.

          listen to the car.

          SPEED
          What do you need?
          Something makes him put the car in second gear. He steps
          on the accelerator, then hits the starter and---

          Speed comes out of the spiral, glimpsing the back of the
          trailers as they go over the Big Drop.
          Where they ease over the edge, Speed hurls out, going
          airborne, free-falling past two trailers, as--
          The grade of the slope reaches up and gently eases the
          Mach 5 back onto the track, to the delight of the crowd.
          The Mach 5 surfs up the big bank, weaving through another
          pair that try to stop him with spectacularly disastrous
          results.

          with two cars left ahead of him--
          Mushi motors and the Gray Ghost.

          checkered black and white--
          Fluttering softly in the silence as the crowd begins to

          The Mach 5 slides to a stop and for a moment Speed
