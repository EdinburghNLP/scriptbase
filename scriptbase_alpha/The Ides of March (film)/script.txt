          INT. MIAMI UNIVERSITY - OXFORD OHIO - AUDITORIUM - DAY
                         
          Stephen Meyers, Press Secretary to Governor Morris is
          standing at a podium on a stage...there is a single spotlight
          on him. The rest of the stage is dark.
          Stephen is talking into a mic with no emotion...just matter
          of factly.
                          STEPHEN
           I am neither Christian...nor
           atheist. I am not Jewish or
           Muslim. What I believe...my
           religion is called the
           constitution...
          A pause.
          Stephen snaps his fingers in the mic. We hear the distinct
          sound of feedback getting louder until it stops.
                         
          We hear the director speak over the loud speaker.
                         
                          DIRECTOR
           Hang on...let me open these up....
          We wait as Stephen looks around. He looks at stage hands who
          are busy working. No one pays any attention to him as he
          stands there. This isn't awkward for Stephen, THIS IS
          ROUTINE.
                          DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
           Okay...
                         
          Lights come up on another podium revealing a debate stage.
          Stephen continues.
                         
                          STEPHEN
           I will defend till my dying breath
           your right to worship whatever god
           you believe in...
                         
          The lights on Stephen's podium go out, he's in the dark. He
          keeps going.
                          STEPHEN (CONT'D)
           If I'm not religious enough for
           you, don't vote for me.
          To the Director.

                          STEPHEN (CONT'D)
           You got it?
                         
          His podium light comes back on.
          No answer from the Director, Stephen continues.
                         
                          STEPHEN (CONT'D)
           If I'm not experienced enough don't
           vote for me. If I'm not...
                         
                          DIRECTOR
           Okay got it, thanks.
                         
                          STEPHEN
           Thanks. We'll need these monitors
           turned up a bit...it's a big space
           and he wants to be able to hear.
                          STAGE MANAGER
           You got it.
                         
                          STEPHEN
           Also we'll need these podiums put
           on a riser as we agreed to in the
           pre-conditions. You're a few
           inches short and it makes it harder
           for the Governor to read his notes.
                         
                          STAGE MANAGER
           No I know, we just got those specs
           last night and they're building a
           piece to go under...
                         
                          STEPHEN
           Great, thanks. See you guys in a
           few hours.
                         
          We see we're in an auditorium of a college.
          Stephen meets up with BEN HARPEN his staffer.
                         
                          BEN
           I didn't know the Governor had
           trouble reading his notes. Why
           doesn't he wear...
                          STEPHEN
           He doesn't but Pullman is 5'8"
           he'll look like a hobbit behind
           that podium.

          ROB BRAUN, a local Cincinnati anchor, talks to camera as we
          see STEPHEN and BEN exit the building. Under this we hear
          Rachel Maddow reporting.
                         
           RACHEL MADDOW (O.C.)
           Well it all comes down to this...We
           are one week away from the Ohio
           primary...
          Camera now moves past ROB to another news truck where an
          MSNBC REPORTER stands in front of a camera waiting to go
          live. There is a monitor in front of him.
          The camera keeps moving into the monitor where RACHEL MADDOW
          does the lead in.
                         
          As RACHEL's audio continues we see the following images.

          We cruise along a snow-covered rural landscape - flat, gray,
          desolate. In the distance we see a barn with huge red-white-
          and-blue letters painted on the side. They read "OHIO FOR
          MORRIS".
                         
           RACHEL MADDOW (O.S.)
           Two democrats are left standing.
           Senator Pullman of Arkansas who is
           trailing Governor Morris from
           Pennsylvania.
                         
          Moments later we roll past another farm with a large
          billboard staked into the ground beside the road: "PULLMAN -
          AMERICA'S FUTURE BEGINS ON MARCH 15th".
                         
          EXT. SUBURBAN STREET
                         
          We cut to canvassers - bundled to the hilt against the cold -
          knocking on doors in a suburban neighborhood. Yard signs for
          both candidates line the street.

           Governor Morris has mounted a
           sizable lead with 2047 delegates,
           winning New Hampshire, California,
           New York and Michigan...But Senator
           Pullman with 1302 delegates is
           still in the hunt having won
           Florida, Tennessee, Virginia and
           Missouri...
                         
          EXT. CITY INTERSECTION
                         
          Supporters at an intersection waving hand-made signs to cars:
          "HONK FOR MORRIS". A passing car lays on the horn and the
          supporters cheer.
           RACHEL MADDOW (O.S.)
           A win in Ohio could turn it all
           around for the Arkansas Senator...
                         
          CLOSE UP of a Pullman bumper sticker on an SUV at a
          stoplight, right next to a "My Child is an Honor Student"
          decal.
                         
           RACHEL MADDOW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           So one week from Tuesday the all
           important hundred and eighty one
           Ohio delegates could be the
           deciding factor..

          A clerk placing a Morris sign in the store window. In the
          shop next door various TV's are in a window display. We see
          RACHEL MADDOW'S report on them.
           RACHEL MADDOW (O.S.)
           And once again the old adage is
           true..."As goes Ohio, so goes the
           Nation."

          it's the size of a coffin, jammed to the hilt with twenty-

                          SENATOR PULLMAN
           Would you call yourself a
           Christian?
           GOV. MORRIS
           How would that matter?
                         
                          SENATOR PULLMAN
                          (READING)
           "I have no idea what happens when
           we die, maybe nothing...maybe it
           was like before we were born." You
           did write this Governor...
                         
           GOV. MORRIS
           Then let me try and clarify...I was
           raised Catholic, I am not a
           practicing Catholic...I have no
           idea what happens when you die and
           if the Senator does, then perhaps
           he should be President. I'll even
           vote for him.
                         
          The audience laughs.
                         
                          SENATOR PULLMAN
           Is that your idea of being
           specific?
                         
          MOLLY passes out coffee.

           Let me be more specific. I am
           neither a Christian, nor an
           atheist, I'm not Jewish or
           Muslim...what I believe...my
           religion is written on a piece of
           parchment called the Constitution.
           Meaning I will defend, till my
           dying breath, your right to
           worship, in whatever God or lack
           thereof you believe in, as long as
           it doesn't hurt others. I believe
           we should be judged as a government
           by how we take care of those who
           can't take care of themselves.
           That's my religion. If you feel
           that I'm not religious enough, then
           don't vote for me. If you feel I'm
           not experienced enough or tall
           enough then don't vote for me.
           Because I'm not going to change
           those to get elected.

           I just wanted you to say out loud
           if you believed in the teachings of
           the Bible.
                         
           GOV. MORRIS
           Is this a Democratic primary or a
           general election?
                         
          People laugh.
                         
           SENATOR PULLMAN (ON MONITOR)
           Well Governor, whoever wins this
           contest will be running for
           President...and if you don't think
           that these questions won't be
           central in a general election then
           you are living in fantasy land. I
           applaud your honesty Governor, I
           do...I'm simply pointing to what is
           obvious...we are running for
           President of the United
           States...not for student council
           president.

          PAUL is pushing fifty with the grizzled look of a hardened
          campaign veteran. He's Stephen's boss, the only guy between
          him and Governor Morris.
                         
          Arms crossed, they watch their man on stage.

                          DUFFY
           I'm trying to remember if the
           democrats ever nominated an atheist
           before...
                         
                          PAUL
           Well, we know they've nominated
           jackasses before.

           Looks like you got some brains now
           too. Be careful. I just might
           have to steal him from you.
          Duffy walks off to greet Senator Pullman as he makes his way

          Stephen, Paul, Ida, and Ben are having drinks around a table.
          The mood is festive. There is a piano player playing,
          singing.
                         
          PAUL has a roll-away suitcase beside him.

           on the 15th.

           Us by nine.

           Nine? There's no way you'll win by
           nine.
                         
                          STEPHEN
           At least. Maybe more.
                          IDA
           (To PAUL) So you're certain you're

                          IDA
           You just said you'll win by nine.
                          PAUL
           And I think we will, but I won't
           tell you it's a sure thing. Fucking
           Saint Gabriel can blow his horn on
           election day and get his four
           horseman to rig the ballot boxes
           for Pullman and it wouldn't
           surprise me. Don't get me wrong.
           Six presidentials I've done and
           I've never felt this good. But am I
           gonna sit here and say "Yes -we
           will definitely win Ohio"? Not a
           chance. In the last thirty years
           seventy-three Democrats have run
           for president. How many have won?
           Three.

                          PAUL
           Don't twist my words. What I'm
           saying is that I'm not going to
           promise we'll win. But he's
           decorated by Bush Senior from the
           first Gulf war and protested the
           second. He left his state with a
           balanced budget and the fourth
           highest education rate. The
           Republicans have nobody out there
           that can touch this guy...so for
           this moment, this election, this
           primary is the presidential. And
           that Ida, is the state of the
           union. And on that note, I'm gonna
           take a shit.

           going to make a difference in
           peoples lives...Even the people
           that hate him. If Mike Morris is

          Ben walks around to all the staffers, he hands out new cell
          phones.
                          BEN
           Okay so listen up...these are your
           new cell phones...Shelly has pre-
           programmed everyone's numbers
           in...thank you Shelly...no personal
           calls...if you lose them, Paul has
           authorized me to kill you.
          Ben walks into Stephen's office and hands him his new phone.
                         
                          BEN (CONT'D)
           New phones...
                          STEPHEN
           I'll get it in a bit...
                         
          As Ben leaves, we see that Stephen is looking at early
          footage of Governor Morris. Another staffer and an editor
          are watching it with him. Outside the office we can see
          other staffers, through the glass partitions, running around
          in campaign mode.
          We see some of the footage.

           GOV MORRIS (ON MONITOR)
           The economy...health care...I've
           got to believe we can do it. We
           have enemies...we have to
           understand why our enemies are our
           enemies, and see if there is
           something we can do about that
           besides using force. What we know
           from history is the answer to
           extremism is not extremism.
           Whoever is the next president,
           whoever steps up, has got a lot of
           work to do, but you have a little
           work to do yourself.
          Stephen hits pause.
                         
                          STEPHEN
           Fucking kill me...where did we get
           this?

           Thank God it wasn't overseas. Just

           Are you fucking stoned...this is
           the same...the exact same piece the
           Republicans are gonna run against
           him in the general...we don't need
           to brag about it...Hi I'm Neville
           Chamberlain and I want to be your
           commander in chief.

           It's gonna come out but not paid

                          STEPHEN
           Doesn't matter I want to hear him
           denying it. If it's true, find
           out, if it's not, let them spend
           the next day telling the post that
           he doesn't own a diamond mine in
           Liberia...win win.

           Okay.

           We need to counter this Christian

           night...so get going...Where's our
           cut on the new thirty and a sixty
           second spots? We'll show it to him
           this afternoon in the staff
           meeting.

           Got it.
          The Editor and staffer exit.

          hands him some papers.

           research - we feed it to the press,

           I wish it were something bigger

           shit pretty heavy if we want it to
           stick.

          INT. SENATOR THOMPSON'S HOUSE - CHARLOTTE N.C. - DAY
                         
          We follow a housekeeper down the hallway and into the living
          room where we see Paul sitting with, Senator Thompson.
                          SENATOR THOMPSON
           That's what I'm hearing...since
           Super Tuesday I'm a very popular
           guy. What are your polls telling
           you?
                         
                          PAUL
           That Pullman's negatives are
           high...mid forties. Senator we
           have an open seat in the White
           House and the Republicans don't
           have dick. They're disorganized
           and they can't find a nominee that
           isn't a world class fuck up. They
           look like Democrats. No Republican
           is gonna show up to vote for their
           guy. But if Pullman gets the
           Democratic nod they'll show up to
           vote against him.
                         
                          SENATOR THOMPSON
           And so you think they won't for
           your guy...you think Morris gets
           into the independents?
                          PAUL
           I sure do. Senator...I'm a bit
           confused...we need your
           delegates...we need you...your fund
           raising. It was my understanding
           that...your endorsement a week
           before Ohio...would win this for
           us...

           service? It's better for me to
           work off of that.

           I'll get it printed.

           Yeah I said it all here, "It's

           board. And you make it look
           effortless. We both know how much
           work it takes, constantly being on
           guard, weighing every word so
           carefully, every move. But from the
           outside, you make it look easy.

           None of this is about the
           democratic process Steve, It's
           about getting your guy into office.
           Simple as that.
                          STEPHEN
           This is the sort of shit the
           Republicans pull.
                         
                          DUFFY
           You're right, this is exactly what
           the Republicans do, and it's about
           time we learned from them. They're
           meaner, tougher and more
           disciplined than we are. I've been
           in this business for twenty five
           years and I've seen way too many
           Democrats bite the dust because
           they wouldn't get down in the mud
           with the fucking elephants.

          We're in the bathroom of a hotel room. GOVERNOR MORRIS is
          being made up for the Charlie Rose Show. A SECRET SERVICE
          AGENT stands in the adjoining room. The GOVERNOR talks to

          The Governor, who's been talking the whole time, yells out
          through the door.

           Wall Street Journal poll has our

           Is it a difficult decision? I

           see myself... or anyone...
           certainly not a government, telling
           a woman what she can do with her
           body.
                         
                          CHARLIE ROSE
           So you would appoint a judge to...
           GOV. MORRIS
           ... I would consider it arrogant to
           judge someone until I've walked in
           their shoes.
                          CHARLIE ROSE
           But you're against the death
           penalty?
           GOV. MORRIS
           Yes. Because of what it says about
           us as a society.

                          CHARLIE ROSE
           So you, you Governor would impose
           the death penalty.
                         
           GOV. MORRIS
           No, I would commit a crime for
           which I would happily go to jail.
                         
                          CHARLIE ROSE
           Then why not let society do that?
           GOV. MORRIS
           Because society has to be better
           than the individual. If I were to
           do that I would be wrong.

           See laws are different in different
           states. Here in your hotel, in
           Kentucky...it's frowned upon...but

           In fairness, this has been tried
           before...Operation Chaos, as Rush
           Limbaugh called it, where
           Republicans voted for a Democrat
           they thought they could beat in the
           general election. We asked Senator
           Pullman's campaign manager if this
           sudden right wing support is
           welcome...

           can't really see Republicans

           Now, I've been married for eleven

           know...and we have a normal
           marriage...which means when we
           disagree...she wins. What we don't
           ever disagree on is how we're going
           to leave this planet for our
           daughter. Are we gonna leave it
           better off, or worse? The richest
           people in this country don't pay
           their fare share. And when they're
           asked to, they cry socialism, they
           use phrases like redistribution of
           wealth. That scares everybody and
           they all run and they hide. For
           the record, my campaign is
           vehemently against the distribution
           of wealth to the richest Americans,
           by our government! And I will run

           Do we have any other senators that
           can go to bat for us? House
           members won't do.

           would get closer the closer we got

           See we're framing the argument
           based on the idea that
           homosexuality is a choice, you
           choose to be gay, not that you were
           born that way like being born
           black. Because if you start the
           discussion with the idea that gay
           is not a life choice but part of
           your DNA, then gay marriage is and
           can only be a civil rights issue.

          We pull focus now onto STEPHEN and MOLLY.
                         
          STEPHEN on top not moving.
          He looks down to the area where an erection would normally be
          at this time...then he looks back to Molly.
                         
                          STEPHEN
           It's not you.
          They laugh.

          Stephen is lying in bed working on some papers. Molly is
          asleep next to him. Stephen's cell phone rings.
                          STEPHEN
           Hello...
                         
          Almost at the same time we hear another man's voice on the
          phone.
                         
                          VOICE
           Molly?
                         
          They both stop. No one speaks. Stephen is about to speak
          again when the caller hangs up. Stephen looks at the
          phone...he then looks to the bedside table where he sees an
          identical phone. His phone. He's picked up Molly's phone by
          mistake. He looks at the name of the incoming call...there
          is none...he looks at the caller ID number...he looks at the
          clock...2:30 AM.
                         
                          STEPHEN
           Your phone rang.

           I don't know?
                          STEPHEN
           He asked for you by name.

          Stephen, listens to the outgoing message, while he looks at
          Molly...her eyes starting to well up.
          We hear the buzzing of the message through the phone. Then
          we see Stephens reaction as it begins to dawn on him who he's
          listening to.
                         
          He closes the phone without leaving a message.

           nights ago, just before the press

           You're supposed to be my friend
           Ida. You'd stab me in the back
           like this? You'd ruin my
           reputation just so you-
                          IDA
           Wait wait wait -is that what you
           thought? That we were friends?
                         
                          STEPHEN
           I've given you everything -every
           fucking scoop, your profile with
           Pau1....
                          IDA
           You're right -you've given me a
           lot. But let's get real here
           Steve. The only reason you ever
           treated me well was that I work
           for the Times. Not because I was
           your friend. You give me what I
           want, I write you better stories.
           Don't pretend it's any more than
           that. Why'd you meet with Duffy?
                          STEPHEN
           Go fuck yourself.
                         
          STEPHEN starts walking away.
                          IDA
           Okay, I'll make it easier on you.
           Forget Duffy. What happened at
           Paul and Thompson's meeting?

           Of course I do. That's why I'm
           giving you a choice here.
                          STEPHEN
           I could get fired.
                          IDA
           So it's not a difficult choice, is

           You're gonna look like fools

           Listen to this. I got the
           placement in the Times...this is a
           match up of hope versus fear. Nine
           times out of ten the fear candidate
           tends to be the most
           experienced...but in our
           presidential races the least
           experienced candidate almost always
           wins. JFK versus Nixon...Carter

           I don't know how she found out.
           Tried to blackmail me. Said she was
           gonna let the story out if I didn't
           tell her what happened at your
           meeting with Thompson.

           I could just deny the whole thing,

           admits to it, that could look
           worse. If I say no comment they
           won't let up.

           No Stephen. You didn't make a
           mistake. You made a choice. You
           called me and left a message to
           call back...that it was important.
           But when I did...you said to forget
           about it. You chose not to tell
           me. Why did you make that choice?
                          STEPHEN
           I didn't think it was important.
                         
                          PAUL
           Sure you did. But you went because
           you were curious, because you were
           flattered. Because it made you feel
           special to think Duffy wanted to
           speak to you instead of me. Because
           you thought to yourself: maybe I
           can get something out of this.
           Because it made you feel big.
           First campaign I ran tiny little
           race in Kentucky -state senate
           seat. Workin for redneck nobody
           named McGuthrie. Had no money, no
           staff, no fuckin office. Everyone
           thought we didn't stand a chance.
           There's no way we can compete. And
           about this time, a guy running a
           congressional campaign a few
           districts over gives me a call.
           Says, "I really like what you were
           able to do for poor ole' Sam. But
           let's face it, he's a goner, so why
           don't you come work for me?" What
           do I do? Well Stephen -this is
           where you and I are different. I
           told Sam about the call. And Sam
           says to me, "Paul, you think this
           other's guy's got a shot at
           winning, and he can pay you more
           than anything I can afford, so if
           it's what you feel you need to do,
           then I won't get in your way." So I
           say, "Sam -you took a chance and
           hired me when I was even more of
           nobody than you are, and I'd be
           damned if I'm gonna jump ship just
           because the shit hit the fan."
           We lost the race, but three years
           later, when Sam decided to run for
           Governor -who do you think he
           called? We won that race.

           Stephen's off the campaign. Paul
           fired him. Some fucking set up
           about loyalty and it looks like
           Stephen was doubling down with
           Duffy on the Pullman campaign. I
           was sitting in the room when Paul
           told Stephen that he was fired.
           Stephen said who's gonna take over
           and Paul said me...and I'm
           like...easy there soldier...but
           Stephen goes ape shit then Paul
           gives the speech about loyalty and

          a table. Duffy is holding court, the mood is light.
                         
          Duffy notices Stephen standing there.
                         
          Duffy walks Stephen a few doors down to a conference room. A

           you'd left Morris before this story
           broke, that'd be one thing. That we
           could control. But the way it'd
           look now -Paul fires you and then
           you come work for us. Looks like
           we're picking up the scraps. Puts
           Morris in the drivers seat. I can't
           have that.

          open.

          opposite way towards the elevators...he's fumbling with his
          walkie-talkie.
          STEPHEN gets to her room and we see a JANITOR kneeling over
          Molly's lifeless body.
          Stephen steps into the room. He can barely move. He just
          stands there looking at the situation.

           minutes...how far away are they?
                         
          The JANITOR now turns and looks at STEPHEN

           Do you know her?
                         
          STEPHEN nods his head yes.
                          JANITOR (CONT'D)
           She's gone.
                         
          We hear the sound of a distant ambulance.
                         
          JANITOR goes back to the phone.
                          JANITOR (CONT'D)
           Hello...I'm sorry what? Yes I can
           hear them now...
          STEPHEN looks down on the bed and sees Molly's phone. He
          reaches down takes it and slides it in his pocket.
                         
          Close on STEPHENS face as he stares down at Molly.
          We hear the ambulance approaching the building

          Stephen comes running out the door. An ambulance has pulled
          up and EMT's are on their way in. Police are also pulling
          up. Stephen keeps walking - he gets in his car and sits
          there.
          Nothing. No emotion.
                         
          Stephen pulls out his phone and listens to his messages.

           The coroner has stated, that based
           on the evidence found by the police
           in the hotel room, that this was an
           accidental overdose, a lethal
           cocktail of alcohol and
           prescription drugs. The Cincinnati
           police chief, Darryl Mathews, has
           called for a full investigation
           pending a toxicology report which
           could take up to two weeks. Just a
           terrible terrible situation for the
           former Senator, now DNC Chairman,
           Jack Stearns and his family.
          Off the Governor's face we:

          the rest of the staff, are standing behind the microphone.
          The Governor is making a statement
           GOV. MORRIS
           The entire staff is in a state of
           shock. We have sent our
           condolences to Jack and JoAnna

           they're going through...
           All we know at this point is it
           appears to be a drug...an
           accidental prescription overdose.

           GOV. MORRIS (CONT'D)
           I don't think we have any of that
           information yet. Obviously there
           will be a full investigation. Just
           wanted to say that our hearts go
           out...our prayers go out to the
           entire family...and she was part of
           our family.

           GOV. MORRIS
           Not well. But I did know her, and
           what I saw was a hard working,
           young woman, with a great and
           positive spirit. It's a very sad
           day in our campaign and a very sad
           day for the people close to Jack.

           How long has she interned with you
           Governor?
          The Governor looks back at Paul. Paul steps up to the mic.

           She'd only been on the road with us

           We will most certainly stay on
           schedule. This accident, and we
           have to assume for now it's an
           accident, is just simply a tragedy.
           The work, the schedule won't be
           altered. It just means that those
           of us that knew Molly will go about
           our jobs with a heavy heart.
                         
          As these questions continue, the Governor's cell phone
          vibrates. He pulls it from his pocket and reads the name of
          the caller. It reads "Molly." He looks up. Panic starts to
          set in - the only sounds we hear are his heart beating and
          the phone vibrating.
          The Governor looks at each of his staff members. Then he
          scans around the room looking through the press corps up to
          the back doorway where he locks eyes with Stephen.
                         
          STEPHEN holds a cell phone to his ear. They stare at each
          other. Then Stephen hangs up, and the Governor's phone stops
          vibrating.
                         
          Stephen turns and leaves.

          sitting in booths. They cross towards the back to the
          kitchen door - STEPHEN enters.

           point in the campaign where some
           changes have to be made etc." You

           you broke the only rule in
           politics. You want to be
           President, you can start a war, you
           can lie, you can cheat, you can

           she didn't want to hurt you.
           GOV. MORRIS
           Then why would she leave a note

           All the things we both believe in.

           Well I don't believe in
           extortion...I don't believe in

           GOV. MORRIS
           No. You were already fired, you
           were out. What were you doing in

                          STEPHEN
           I was fixing a situation...I got a
           call, someone from the hotel
           thought I could help and called me.
           GOV. MORRIS
           You were off the campaign, but you
           thought it was important to come
           back and fix things? It was your
           voice on the phone the other night.

           Okay let's play this out. You're

           everything you've suggested is
           illegal...and you wouldn't fare
           well in federal prison. You were

           her situation. There are no
           records or conversations between
           us. And since she's had an
           abortion, no DNA evidence. So if
           there's no note, then it's your
           word against mine. Your word. A
           fired, disgruntled, employee, or a

           order of things. There is no
           greater grief than a parent laying
           their child to rest...She was a
           little girl trying to make it in a
           very grown up world...a world were

           was smart and pretty and so so

           we're going to move forward or were
           going to live in the past...

           we're going to let greed and

           delegates put the pledged delegates
           out of reach. And with word today
           that the super delegates are
           breaking three to one for Morris.

           Well then do you have the funds?
           As we read it-

                          (SMILING)
           Of course we have the funds. We're

          INT. XAVIER UNIVERSITY GYM CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
          We pick up Stephen walking with Ida.
                         
                          IDA
           You're making me look bad.
                         
                          STEPHEN
           How so?
                          IDA
           I just filed a story that said you
           were off the campaign and Thompson
           was going to Pullman.
                          STEPHEN
           You can't believe everything you
           read.
                          IDA
           I want to give you an opportunity
           to comment on my next story. It
           says that you delivered
           Thompson...You got the three
           hundred and fifty-six delegates,
           you delivered the nomination. And
           all you asked in return was Paul's
           job. Any chance of you confirming
           that?
          They approach a security guard standing by a set of double
          doors.
                          STEPHEN
           No press beyond this point...she's
           press. I'll read about it in the
           funny papers.

           Come on Stephen...aren't we friends
           anymore?
                         
                          STEPHEN
           You're my best friend Ida.
                         
          And Stephen walks through the doors.
          INT. XAVIER UNIVERSITY - GYMNASIUM - A FEW MINUTES LATER
                         
          A wide shot of the darkened gymnasium. Stephen sits on a
          stool in front of a camera lit by a single television light.
                         
          We're now in tight - One PERSON is putting a mic on Stephen
          while the OTHER is applying make-up.
                         
          No one speaks.
          The sound man then puts and earwig into Stephens ear.
                         
                          SOUND MAN
           You should be able to hear
           them...do you hear them?
                         
          We hear the buzzing in his ear of the broadcast from New
          York.
                         
                          STEPHEN
           Yeah I can hear them.
                          SOUND MAN
           Good, quick mic check can you count
           to ten for me?
          Stephen counts to ten. Everyone stands behind the camera.
          The sound man with his headset on whispers..
                         
           SOUND MAN (CONT'D)
           They're coming to you in about
           forty five seconds.
                         
          We sit in silence staring at Stephens face.
                         
          Ten seconds - nothing.
          Twenty seconds - nothing
                         
          This scene starts to resemble our opening - A dark auditorium
          - only a few people doing their individual jobs.
                         
          Stephen looks at two interns holding clipboards and cell
          phones.

          The FIRST AD is sitting on the floor talking on his headset.
                         
          The CAMERAMAN makes adjustments.
                         
          A MAN sweeping the gym floor in the distance.
          They all seem to be staring at him. They probably aren't -
          but he feels it. The enthusiasm and excitement of Stephen
          has given over to emptiness. The price of winning at all
          cost.
                         
          We stay on Stephen's face.
                         
          We now hear the Governor's speech through Stephen's earwig.
           GOV. MORRIS
           Senator Thompson I am proud that
           you have brought integrity back to
           this election. Because that's what
           this comes down to, integrity. Who
           we are. Because how we project
           ourselves to the rest of the world
           matters!...Dignity
           matters!...Integrity matters!...Our
           future depends on it!
          Forty seconds - the silence is broken by the SOUND MAN.
                         
                          SOUND MAN
           Coming to you in
           five...four...three...two...
                         
          Through the earwig we hear an JOHN KING.
                         
                          JOHN KING
           We now have Governor Morris's new
           senior campaign advisor, Stephen
           Myers, coming to us from Xavier
           University where Senator Thompson
           has just endorsed Governor Morris,
           essentially ending this primary
           race. (To Stephen) Stephen, can
           you give us some insight into how
           this whole thing unfolded?
                         
          And before he can answer we:
