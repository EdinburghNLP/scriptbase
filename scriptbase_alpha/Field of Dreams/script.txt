          RAY (V.O.)
          My father’s name was John Kinsella.

          RAY (V.O.)
          It’s an Irish name. He was born in
          North Dakota, in 1896...

          ...and never saw a big city until he
          came back from France in 1918.
          Chicago. Tenement. Comiskey Park. Ballgames.

          RAY (V.O.)
          He settled in Chicago, where he quickly
          learned to live and die with the White
          Sox. Died a little when they lost the
          1919 World Series...

          eight members of the team were accused
          of throwing that Series.

          RAY (V.O.)
          He played in the minors for a year or
          two, but nothing ever came of it. Moved
          to Brooklyn in ’35, married Mom in ’38,
          and was already an old man working at
          the Naval Yards when I was born in 1949.

          My name’s Ray Kinsella. Mom died when
          I was three, and I suppose Dad did the
          best he could. Instead of Mother Goose,
          I was put to bed at night to stories of

          Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig...and the great
          Shoeless Joe Jackson. Dad was a Yankees
          fan then, so of course I rooted for
          Brooklyn. But in '58 the Dodgers moved
          away, so we had to find other things to
          fight about. We did. And when it came
          time to go to college, I picked the
          farthest one from home I could find.
          Berkeley in the 1960s: hippies, protesters, etc.

          RAY (V.0.)
          This, of course, drove him right up the
          wail, which I suppose was the point.
          Officially my major was English, but
          really it was the Sixties.

          I marched, I smoked some grass, I tried
          to like sitar music... and I met Annie.
          Annie: blue jeans, T-shirt, freckles. Their courtship.

          RAY (V.0.)
          The only thing we had in common was that
          she came from Iowa and I had once heard
          of Iowa. We moved in together. After
          graduation, we moved to the Midwest, and
          stayed with her family as long as we
          could.

          RAY (V.0.)
          We rented an apartment and I took a job
          selling insurance. I also drove a cab
          and worked in a pizza parlor. Dad died
          in June of 1 74. Annie and I got married
          that fail.

          A few years later Karin was born. She
          smelled weird, but we loved her anyway.
          Then Annie got the crazy idea that she
          could talk me into buying a farm.

          their farm. Ray in a cornfield.

          RAY (V.0.)
          I'm thirty-eight years old and I'm about
          to become a farmer. I love my family,
          I love baseball, and I miss New York.

          But until I heard The Voice...I'd never
          done a crazy thing in my whole life.

          2 THE CORNFIELD - DUSK

                         2
          It is dusk on a spring evening. The sky is a robin's-egg
          blue, and the wind is soft as a day-old chick. Ray
          Kinsella is working in the cornfield when a voice -- like
          that of a public address announcer -- speaks to him.

                         THE VOICE
          'If you build it, he will come.'
          Ray looks up and around, but sees nothing that could be the
          source of this sound. All around him are empty fields.
          He stands quietly for a few moments, then goes back to
          work.

                         THE VOICE
          'If you build it, he will come.'
          Ray jerks his head in all directions to see where this
          voice is coming from, but again, he sees nothing unusual
          -- just the furrowed fields and a few hundred feet away,
          the massive old farmhouse with a sagging veranda on three
          sides. On the north veranda is a wooden porch swing where
          Annie and Karin sit, sipping lemonade and dreaming.

                         RAY

                         (CALLS)
          Annie, what was that?

          What was what?

          That voice.

                         ANNIE
          What voice?

          Just now. Like an announcement.
          Annie confers briefly with Karin, then calls back to Ray.

                         ANNIE
          We didn't hear anything.

                         RAY
          Oh.
          Ray thinks for a second, then shakes it off, trying to
          dislodge that thought from his mind, and gets back to work.

                         THE VOICE
          'If you build it, he will come.'
          Again, he bolts upright and looks around. Again, he sees
          nothing. This is beginning to bug him. He calls:

                         RAY
          Okay, you must've heard that.

          Annie and Karin lock at each other and exchange a shrug.
          Annie extends her arms palms upward, and calls to Ray.

                         ANNIE
          Sorry. Come on. Dinner.
          Annie leads Karin inside.

          Ray looks all around him with an "Okay, fellas, what's the
          joke?" look on his face. But there is no one there. He
          puts down his tools and walks toward the house.

          5 INT. KITCHEN

          Ray enters, looks at his wife skeptically and joins his
          wife and daughter setting the table.

                         RAY
          Was there like a sound truck on the
          highway, or something?

                         ANNIE
          Nape.

          Nope. You really hearing voices?

          Ah. God?

                         RAY
          More like a. . .ballpark announcer.
          Annie shoots him an "Are you kidding?" look. Ray responds
          with a shrug. They sit down to eat.

                         ANNIE
          What'd it say?

                         RAY

          They are snuggled together, asleep. All is quiet. Then:

                         THE VOICE
          'If you build it, he will come.'
          Ray's eyes pop open. He looks at Annie, who does not stir.
          Without moving, he looks around the room. There is no one
          there. Very quietly, he crosses to the window and looks
          out. He whispers out toward the cornfield:

                         RAY
          Build what? For who?

          It's okay, honey, I'm just-talking to
          the cornfield.
          He sighs and goes back to bed. Annie cuddles up to him.
          Her eyes are closed, but Ray's eyes remain open. He is
          puzzled and concerned.

          sleep, and promptly turns the TV set off.

          Why'd you do that? It was funny.

                         RAY
          Trust me, Karin, it's not funny. The
          man is sick. He's very sick.
          Annie enters, putting on her coat.

                         ANNIE
          Karin, if you're finished, get your coat
          and school bag. Let's go.
          Karin bolts from the table.

                         RAY
          Uh honey, I'll take her today. I'v-e got
          some errands in town.

          people hear things all the time. I

          circus, and I was training to be a

          No. It's just that I heard some farmers

          12 RAY'S FARM - DAY 12
          Ray is out in the fields again, hard at work. A breeze
          picks up. He stops fora moment, cocks an ear and looks
          around. All he sees are the empty fields. Insects make
          the only sounds. He goes back to work. Then:

                         THE VOICE
          'If you build it, he will come.'

                         CONTINUED

                         12 CONTINUED 12
          He throws his tools down angrily and looks all around, but
          there is no apparent source of the voice. Ray is pissed.

                         RAY
          All right, who are you, and what the
          hell do you want from me?!?
          All he hears is a faraway echo.

                         THE VOICE
          'If you build it, he will come.'
          This is serious. Ray shakes his head and repeats the words
          to himself.

                         RAY
          If you build it...
          As he thinks about these words,,some unexplained impulse
          causes Ray to turn his head deliberately toward a portion
          of the cornfield between him and the house.

                         1

          13 A BASEBALL FIELD L3
          For the briefest of moments, the dreamlike image of a
          baseball field at night, illuminated by floodlights, flares
          in over the lawn. Standing on the edge of the field, is
          the figure of a man with his back to us. Before we can see
          anything else, the image disappears.

                         14 RAY 14
          Ray's eyes widen.

                         RAY

          i5 THE MAN AND THE FIELD 1 5
          The dream image flares in again, this time closer to the
          man. He stands in the middle distance, silhouetted by the
          lights, and we see he is wearing a uniform of some kind.
          He starts to turn slowly towards us, but before we can see
          his face, the image disappears.

                         16
          Ray's mouth opens. He half-laughs, as if to say "This
          can't be." But whatever is in his mind won't go away.

                         RAY
          .he will come.

                         17
          Now we see him in head-and-shoulders. He has the muscular
          neck of an athlete. As he slowly turns we start to see a
          bit of his weathered face before the image flares out.

                         18 RAY

                         18
          Wheels are turning inside his head. He is trying to figure
          all this out. In the distance, a bell is ringing. He
          looks O.S.

          Annie is on the veranda ringing the dinner bell hanging by

          We see Ray emerge slowly from the fields, the twilit sky
          changing colors behind him.

          Annie leans against a post, lazily watching Ray approach.
          She likes how he moves, and how he looks.

                         ANNIE
          Hiya, cutie.
          Ray climbs up the steps, accepts her kiss, and instead of
          following her into the house, pulls her down with him onto
          the swing. He takes-her hand and looks into her eyes.

                         RAY

          You heard the voice again.

                         RAY
          Wait, this gets better, I just saw a
          vision.

                         ANNIE
          Get out of here!

                         RAY

                         ANNIE
          We're going to have to burn you at the

          Hey, you don't suppose this could be
          like an acid flashback, do you?

          I never took acid.

          Maybe you will someday, and it's a flash
          forward.

          field out there, Shoeless Joe Jackson
          will get to come back and play ball
          again.

          I always felt cheated I never got to see
          him play. He was supposed to be so
          graceful, and agile. So to actually get
          to see him play again...to let him play
          again, to right an old wrong...
          He shakes his head in wonder just to think of it. Annie
          turns on the light.

          I mean, I can't think of one good reason
          why I should,-but...
          (takes a breath)
          I'm thirty-eight years old, I have a
          wife, a child, and a mortgage, and I'm
          scared to death I'm turning into my
          father.

                         ANNIE
          What's your father got to do with this?
          Ray tries to picture his father in his mind. He speaks
          softly, but the words obviously have a great deal of
          meaning for him.

                         RAY
          I never forgave him for getting old.
          By the time he'was as old as I am now,
          he was ancient. He must have had
          dreams, but he never did anything about
          them. For all I know, he may have even
          heard voices, too, but he sure didn't
          listen to them. The man never did one
          spontaneous thing in all the years I
          knew him. Annie, I'm scared that that's
          what growing up means. I'm afraid of
          that happening to me. And something
          tells me this may be my last chance to
          do something about it.
          (looks at her)
          I want to build that field. Do you
          think I'm crazy?
          She looks at him with great understanding.

                         ANNIE
          Yes.
          He smiles wanly. She touches his face lovingly.

                         ANNIE
          I also think that if you feel you really
          have to do this... then you should do it.
          They hold each other's gaze, and Ray cannot remember when
          he has loved her so much. He takes her in his arms.
          Outside their window, the field of corn lies waiting.

          Stalks of corn wave slowly in the breeze. A bee buzzes
          near one. The light is yellow. Suddenly, the stalks bend
          violently to the ground as Ray's tractor plows them under.

          27 ON THE TRACTOR 27
          Ray drives, Karin rides shotgun, holding the large detailed
          diagram Ray has drawn of the ballpark's dimensions.

                         RAY
          Ty Cobb called him the greatest left
          fielder of all time. His glove was
          called 'the place where triples go to
          die.'

                         28 HIGH ANGLE 28
           The tractor turns to plow under more corn, and we can see
           the size of the area Ray has staked off with marker sticks.

          Karin whistles.

          By the side of the road, an old man and woman stand and
          watch these neighbors-plow under their. corn. They look at
          each other as if to say "Could it be Communists?"

          KARIN (V.0.)
          Why'd they called him Shoeless Joe?

          30 SEEDING THE FIELD - DAY 30
          It is days later, an area the size of a baseball field has
          been plowed under, and Ray is seeding it.

          RAY (V.O.)
          When he was still in the minors, he
          bought a new pair of spikes and they
          hurt his feet. About the sixth inning
          he took them off and played the outfield
          in just his socks. The other players
          kidded him, called him Shoeless Joe, and
          the name stuck.

          We can see roughly where the grass has been planted, and
          where the dirt will be smoothed out for the base paths.
          Ray stands stock-still in the moonlight, water hose in
          hand, patiently misting the baby grass, little Karin at his
          side.

          RAY (V.0.)
          Then in 1919, his team, the Chicago
          White Sox, threw the World Series.

          KARIN (V.0.)
          What's 'threw'?

          RAY (V.0.)
          They lost it on purpose. Gamblers paid
          them to.

          32 SIDE OF THE ROAD

                         32
          Now, dozens of families stand to watch silent and
          dumb-eyed, at what has obviously become a daily spectacle
          among the townspeople. Some snap photos.

          33 SMOOTHING OUT THE FIELD - DAY
          Ray smooths out the base paths with a large roller, as
          Annie and Karin follow behind with rakes. On either side
          of the base paths, the infield and outfield grass is
          growing.

          RAY (V.0.)
          Nobody could prove anything one way or
          another, but he was the one guy who
          probably wasn't in on it.

          Ray, Annie and Karin wait as the cashier totals up their
          load of lumber and hardware.

                         RAY
          I mean if he was supposed to be throwing
          it, how do you explain the fact he hit
          375 for the series and didn't commit
          one error? Huh?

                         KARIN

          From O.S., we hear oooh. Ray turns and notices for the
          first time that a crowd of spectators -- employees and
          customers -- has been watching him and whispering among
          themselves. They look at him as if he had two heads.
          Ray turns his attention back to writing a check for his
          purchases. He deadpans to Annie:

                         RAY
          We'd better notify Mars to send us more
          money.

          That's his problem. And tell him to
          make it in Earth dollars this time.
          Ray hands over the check to the open-mouthed cashier.

                         RAY
          Thank you. Have a nice day.
          Ray and Annie turn and leave with Karin. The farmers

          annoyed that once again, he is being stared at by all the

          Store Owner staring at him the most intently.

          In this sharp white light the grass glows parrot green,
          cool as mint, soft as a cashmere blanket. Annie and Karin
          watch as Ray puts down the clean white bases, which pick
          up the light like little moons on a cold, clear night.

          My father said he saw him years later
          playing under a made-up name in some
          tenth-rate league in Carolina. He'd put
          on fifty pounds, and the spring was gone
          from his step, but he could still hit.
          Dad used to say no one could hit like

          Ray takes a breath and steps out onto the veranda. The

          an "O" in the top crook, an "X" in the bottom, and an
          American flag with forty-eight stars on his left sleeve.

                         54
          Moving closer to the field we see the Man standing out in
          left field. Feet spread wide, body bent forward from the
          waist, hands on hips, he waits.

          Ray's mouth is dry. He reaches home plate and picks up one
          of the bats lying beside the pail of hard balls. The back
          of his neck tingles. Then, he picks up one of the balls.

          56 IN THE OUTFIELD

                         56
          The Man spreads his feet, pounds his small, old-style
          glove, and waits to field the ball.

          57 AT HOME PLATE 57
          Ray tosses the ball a few feet into the air and swings at
          it. And misses. His face reddens, he clears his throat,
          and tries again. This time he connects.

                         58 THE FIELD 58
          He has hit a grounder that would be easily fielded by a
          shortstop had there been one, but it bounces through and
          falls into left field. The Man runs in for it, scoops it
          up cleanly and throws it back to the plate.
          Ray is thrilled. He hits another ground ball, and this
          too, is fielded cleanly. Then another, which the Man
          deftly short-hops. Ray hollers out to him.

                         RAY
          How's the field play?

                         THE MAN
          It's good. The ball bounces true.
          Ray smiles with pride. He tosses up another ball, gives
          it his best swing, and is thrilled to see he has actually
          lofted one into the air. But into center field. The Man
          sprints across the outfield, and makes a lovely catch in
          short center. Instead of throwing the ball in, the Man
          runs it in, loping toward home plate. Ray's heart thumps.

                         RAY
          Hi.
          The Man nods at him, takes the bat, and tests it to feel
          its weight.

                         RAY
          Ray Kinsella.

                         THE MAN
          Joe Jackson.
          Ray is thrilled to hear the words spoken. It is Shoeless
          Joe Jackson after all, who stands not five feet away from
          him, trying out all the bats now. Ray isn't quite sure if
          he should talk, or ask questions, or just stand there.
          Finally, he can't help himself.

                         RAY
          I bet its good to be playing again,
          huh?

                         SHOELESS JOE
          It was like having part of me amputated.

                         58 CONTINUED
          Joe looks over at Ray, now, his dark eyes evincing the pain
          his steady voice tries to conceal.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          I've heard that old man wake up and
          scratch itchy legs that've been dust for
          fifty years. That was me. I'd wake up
          in the night with the smell of the
          ballpark in my nose and the cool of the
          grass on my feet. The thrill of the
          grass...
          He has found the bat he likes.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          Can you pitch?

                         RAY

                         (WITH FALSE

                         MODESTY)
          Yeah, I'm not bad.
          Joe hands Ray the bucket of balls. Ray can barely contain
          his excitement as he races to the mound. He stands on the
          rubber and faces Joe at the plate.

                         RAY
          Don't we need a catcher?

                         SHOELESS JOE
          Not if you can get it near the plate,
          we don't.
          Ray smiles, takes a breath and starts his windup, during
          which he says aloud to himself:

                         RAY
          I am pitching to Shoeless Joe Jackson.
          He makes a pitch. It's not a very good one, and Joe has
          to step across the plate to make contact, but his swing is
          graceful, compact and effortlessly powerful. He drives the
          ball against the fence.
          Ray watches it with wonder and when he turns back, Jackson
          is gesturing with the bat for him to make the next pitch.
          Ray makes the standard pitcher's gesture for a curve ball.

                         RAY
          See if you can hit my curve.
          °He goes into an elaborate windup, throws it, it does not
          curve much, and Jackson whistles it right by Ray's ear.

                         CONTINUED

                         RAY
          Yes, he can hit the curve.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          Stick with fast balls, kid.

                         RAY
          You bet.
          Ray makes another pitch, and Jackson hits a line drive down
          the third base line. Then a smoker down the first base
          line. Ray is mightily impressed.

                         RAY
          Wow.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          Damn, this feels good. Put it right
          here, huh?
          Joe holds the bat out low over the plate and Ray pitches
          it reasonably close to that spot. Jackson hits it out of
          the park, and beams. Ray brightens up with remembrance.

                         RAY
          Right, you were a low ball hitter.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          Oh man, I did love this game. You know,
          I'd have played for food money. it was
          the game, the sounds, the smells. You
          ever held a glove or a ball to your
          face?
          Ray smiles as he walks in from the mound.

                         RAY
          Yeah.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          And it was riding the trains from town
          to town. And the hotels with brass
          spittoons in the lobbies and brass beds
          in the rooms. And it was the crowd
          getting to their feet when the ball was
          hit deep. Shoot, I'd have played for
          free.
          The sound of a screen door turns their. attention to the
          house. Annie and Karin are coming out to them.

                         RAY

          Jackson nods and then points to the floodlights.

          Ray and Annie look at Joe for a moment, not quite
          understanding the ground rules here. Joe senses their
          discomfort and changes the subject.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          Hey, can I come back again?

                         RAY
          Yeah. I built this for you.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          There are others, you know. There were
          eight of us. It'd sure mean a lot to
          them.

                         RAY
          Oh man, anytime. They're all welcome
          here.
          Joe looks out over the field in eager anticipation of the
          good times to come.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          Thank you, Ray. I appreciate it. See
          you later, huh?

          Yeah. See you later.

          Say it ain't so, Joe!
          Joe laughs and walks to the outfield. Annie puts her arm
          around Ray and snuggles her head against his chest.
          Nearby, brook water splashes softly in the darkness, a frog
          shrills, and fireflies dazzle the night.
          Joe is in the outfield grass now, walking toward a door cut
          into the fence.

          voice carrying effortlessly through the night air.

          No. It's Iowa.
          Shoeless Joe Jackson nods and fades away as he walks
          through the door in the fence. Ray and Annie looks at each
          other in absolute wonder.

          father at belt level, hugging his neck.

          Karin and Ray sit on the bleachers, eating peanuts while
          Shoeless Joe and his seven teammates practice. (Three,
          including Shoeless Joe, are in the outfield, two more in
          the infield, one pitches, one catches, and one bats.)
          The men are all in their twenties or thirties, but show the
          sheer enjoyment of returning after an absence of sixty-five
          years to the game they love.
          Ray directs Karin's attention to the left fielder.

                         RAY
          Watch Joe. Watch his feet as the
          pitcher gets the sign and starts to
          pitch. A good left fielder knows what
          pitch is coming, and he can tell from
          the.angle of the bat where the ball's
          going to be hit.
          At the sharp crack of the bat Shoeless Joe whirls, takes
          five loping strides toward the fence, turns again', reaches
          up, and the ball smacks into his glove.
          Karin cheers. One of the players good-naturedly boos.

          Oh yeah? At least I got muscles.

                         HAPPY FELSCH
          No. At most you got muscles.

          Come on, asshole, pitch!
          The good-natured banter stops short, and the other players
          glare at Weaver who looks sheepishly toward the little girl
          and her father in the bleachers.

                         BUCK WEAVER
          Sorry, kid.

          Annie emerges with-her Mother, Mark and Dee, walking toward
          the bleachers where Karin and Ray are still watching the
          spirited practice.

                         ANNIE
          Ray? Mom's leaving.

                         RAY

          to help.

                         RAY
          I know.
          Mark just stands there for a moment, the only sounds coming
          from the players on the, field.

                         MARK
          I thought you two were going to watch
          some game.

                         RAY
          Oh, I guess it's not really a game.
          It's more like a practice.
          Mark looks at his wife and Mother with concern. Ray
          doesn't understand this reaction.

                         RAY
          See, there's only eight of them, so they
          can't play a real game...

          Eight of what?
          Ray points to the noisy players on the field.

                         RAY
          Them.
          Now, Mother and Dee look as if they're about to go into
          mourning. Mark kneels next to Karin.

                         MARK
          Karin honey... what are you watching?

                         KARIN
          The baseball men.

                         MARK

          Mark stands up and shoots Ray an accusing look. Annie's

           Annie questions Mark and Dee as they pass her on the way
           to catch up with Mother.

          He and Annie sit beside Karin and watch the players. Each

          The practice is over, the players are perspired and
          exhilarated. Ray is over at first base talking with Swede
          Risberg, the shortstop.

                         SWEDE RISBERG
          Here, look at this. Sixty-five years
          since I worn this uniform, still fits
          me like a glove.

          They all laugh. Ray clearly loves being part of this
          locker room-style comradery. Karin runs to the house.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          Come on, fellas. Let's hit the

          See you later, Ray.

                         RAY
          Right. See you guys.
          The players call their "good-byes" to Ray and head for the
          door in the outfield fence. Ray watches them fade out as
          they go through the door. Then he takes a moment to look
          around him.
          The baseball diamond set in the cornfield is quite
          beautiful. Ray takes a satisfied breath, and walks back
          toward his house. He is the very picture of contentment.
          Then he hears The Voice.

                         THE VOICE
          'Ease his pain.'
          Ray stops short.

          Come on, wash up. We've got a PTA

          Parents stream in past the "PTA Meeting Tonite" sign. Ray
          and Annie stand by the doorway, talking with Miss Corser,
          Karin's teacher. (Ray is too distracted by his own
          thoughts to pay this much attention.)

                         MISS CORSER
          Karin has such a wonderful imagination.
          Lately, she's been making up these
          charming little stories about ghosts who
          play baseball in a cornfield... wonderful
          imagination.

          Ray and Annie -- along with a hundred or so other grownups
          -- are sitting in chairs too small for their grownup
          backsides. Ray is still lost in his own thoughts, doodling
          "Ease his pain" over and over again, while an Irate Mother
          has the floor, holding up a novel.

                         IRATE MOTHER
          .and I say smut and filth like this has
          no place in our schools!
          A large portion of the audience applauds. Annie whispers
          snarlingly to Ray:

                         ANNIE
          Fascist. I'd like to ease her pain.
          Ray is still lost in thought.

                         PRINCIPAL
          Mrs. Perkins, the book you are waving
          about is hardly smut. It is considered
          by many critics as the classic novel
          about growing up in the 1960s.

                         ANNIE
          (whispers to Ray)

                         PRINCIPAL
          Terence Mann is a Pulitzer prize-winner,
          and was widely regarded as the finest
          satirist of his time.

                         IRATE MOTHER
          Well I think he's a pervert, and quite

          The se-called novels of Terence Mann
          endorse promiscuity, godlessness, the
          mongrelization of races, and disrespect
          to high-ranking officers of the United
          States Army. And that's why right-

           country have been banning this guy's

          gentle voice of.reason during a time of
          great madness. He coined the phrase
          'Make Love, Not War.' When others were
          chanting 'Burn, baby, burn,' he was
          writing about love, and peace, and
          understanding. He helped define an era.
          And a generation. And he helped us
          laugh at ourselves. I cherished every
          one of his books, and I dearly wish he'd
          write more. And if you had experienced
          even a little bit of the Sixties, you
          might feel the same way, too.

          No. I think you had two Fifties, and

          Ray is so excited at his revelation that he really wants

          anything in my life. There's a reason.

                         ANNIE
          What. Just tell me what it is.

                         RAY
          I think something's going to happen at
          the game. I don't know what,
          but...there's something at Fenway Park
          in Boston, and I have to be there with
          Terence Mann to find it.
          Something he just said changes Annie's mood.

                         ANNIE
          Fenway Park... Is that the one with the
          big green wall in left field?

                         RAY
          Yeah.

                         ANNIE
          I dreamt last night you were at Fenway.

          Uh, was I sitting on the first base
          side?

          Ray is throwing clothes into a suitcase as fast as he can.
          Annie reads from a road map she has marked for him.

          .you take that to 93, and then it gets
          all squiggly, and after that you're on
          your own. How are you going to find
          him, anyway? He won't exactly be in the
          phone book, you know.

                         RAY
          The article says he has a storefront on
          Harvard Street next to some place that
          sells Kosher food. Shouldn't be too
          hard to find. I don't need a tie, do

          No, dear. Not for a kidnapping.

          Ray has packed the car and is getting ready to leave.

          You'll be okay, right?

                         ANNIE
          I'll try to sell the combine. We sure
          don't need it anymore.
          Karin runs up, grabs Ray behind each ear and hugs and
          kisses him.

          He get into the car and looks up at Annie.

                         RAY
          I'll call you every night. If the team
          shows up while I'm gone, just tell
          them...

          On second thought, stay away from them.

          the expressway there are sweaty factories, and on the
          other, old wood-frame apartment buildings with advertising
          for long-forgotten products painted on the sides. Lunatic

          Ray drives slowly, looking for a store that sells Kosher
          food. But in this old newish neighborhood, there are
          dozens: butcher shops, delis, bakeries, groceries.

          Ray is asking the spritely Jewish Butcher for directions.

                         RAY
          He lives right around here. Do you know
          him? I'm a friend of his.
          The Butcher just stares back, with suspicion.

                         RAY
          He's sort of a tall, black man.

                         BUTCHER
          If you was much of a friend, he'd of
          give you the directions himself.
          Ray nods. He knows this is useless.

                         RAY
          That's a good point. Thank you.

          Ray has stopped an Ancient Jewish Woman on the street. She

                         ANCIENT WOMAN
          I don't know where he lives.
          But by her raised eyebrows and the tone of her voice, it
          is clear that if she did know -- which she probably does
          -- she certainly wouldn't tell him.

                         82
          In between a deli and a Kosher butcher shop, Ray finds a
          storefront with blacked-out windows. He enters an open
          hallway in which he sees the door to the storefront, as
          well as stairs to the apartments above it.
          There are half-a-dozen mail boxes on the wall. Ray checks
          the names. He smiles.

                          83
           All but one have immigrant names. The first one reads:

                         84
          Ray turns to the storefront door. Instead of a buzzer
          there is a long wire with a weight on its end hanging from
          a hole at the top of the door. Next to the wire is a
          handwritten note taped to the door, which reads: "You
          better have a goddamn good reason for ringing this bell."
          Ray laughs. This guy is great. He pulls on the wire. On
          the other side of the door, a bell rings.
          Ray has to struggle to control his nervousness. He takes
          a breath. He hears footsteps inside, approaching the door.
          He cannot help but smile with delight at the thought of
          meeting one of his cultural heroes.
          The door opens. Terence Mann is menacingly huge. He
          glares at Ray and roars:

                         MANN
          Who the fuck are you???-
          Ray is momentarily taken aback, but he figures maybe the
          guy is joking, so he just smiles and plunges ahead.

                         RAY
          Sir, my name is Ray Kinsella, and it's
          a great pleasure 'Co finally ---
          The door slams in his face. It takes Ray a few seconds to
          realize the interview is over.
          He rings the bell again. The door opens. Mann°s large
          frame fills it.

          Just one minute. I'm begging you.
          Mann looks him over. Then he sighs.

          Mann turns and enters the storefront. Ray follows.

          It is hardly fashionable, but it's roomy and comfortable.
          There are tables stacked high with mailing envelopes and
          a postage scale. A few workbenches have software and
          spread sheets strewn across them. In the back are a couple
          of personal computers.
          On a side wall there are book jackets and newspaper photos
          in cheap frames: pictures of Mann with Martin Luther
          King...with Bob Dylan...with Timothy Leary...rann being
          arrested at some demonstration.. .Mann at Woodstock...

          Now look. I'm not going to hurt you,
          I just need you to go with me for a
          little while, then -- what are you
          doing?
          Mann has found a crowbar among his tools, and is advancing
          toward Ray.

                         MANN
          I'm going to beat you with a crowbar
          till you go away.
          Understandably, this makes Ray nervous.

                         RAY
          Whoa! Wait! You can't do that.

                         MANN

                         (STILL ADVANCING)
          What, are there rules? There's no
          rules.
          Mann is almost to him, now, the crowbar raised above his
          head.

                         RAY
          You're a pacifist!
          Mann stops. He thinks. He lowers the crowbar.

                         MANN
          Shit.
          Ray breathes a sigh of relief.

                         RAY
          Thank you.

          I'm sorry. I was hoping I could-just
          convince you to come with me.

          does.
          Mann now has no idea what to make of all this, so he just
          looks Ray over for a few seconds.

                         RAY

          least crazy person I've ever known.

                         MANN
          Then why are you kidnapping me to a

                         RAY
          I read an interview you gave a long time
          ago about how you always dreamed of
          playing at Ebbets Field, and how sad you
          felt when they tore it down.

          Mann picks up a hat,

          Mann sits tensely beside Ray, who drives with his right
          hand, while his left hand remains in his pocket,
          substituting for a gun.

                         MANN
          You do this often?

                         RAY
          No. It's my first time. So be gentle.
          Ray laughs nervously, and is embarrassed to see Mann not
          sharing the humor.

                         RAY
          You used to have a sense of humor.

          Ray pulls up at an intersection. He has to choose between
          left and right. Behind him, cars are honking. Ray doesn't
          have a clue which way to go. He sighs.

                         RAY
          I'm sorry. This is really humiliating.
          Which way is-Eenway?
          Mann shakes his head, then tilts it to the left.

          You're really inept at this, aren't you?
          Ray grins sheepishly and nods. Mann laughs.

          I mean you're like a total bumbler.

          Can I ask you a question? Something
          I've always wanted to know.

          Ray knows now to shut up. He returns his attention to his
          driving, glances up to his rearview mirror, and sees
          something that causes his eyes to widen in horror.

          Mann looks behind him, sees the police car, and turns back
          to Ray. Ray wears a look of resignation as he pulls the
          car over to the side of the road, and shuts off the
          ignition. Mann just looks at him, and starts to chuckle.

                         MANN
          Nice going, Boze.

                         RAY

          don't say anything to this guy, okay?
          I swear to God there's a reason we're
          supposed to be at this game.
          Mann gives him a "Give me a break" look.
          Ray sees the Policeman is getting out of his cruiser and
          walking towards them. Ray is desperate.

                         RAY
          If I get arrested, the press'll be all
          over you, you'll have to appear in open

          Entertainment Tonight, and your
          picture'll be on the front page of every
          tabloid in America.
          The Policeman knocks on Ray's window. He is young,
          fresh-scrubbed and earnest. Ray holds up one hand to him.

          Nervously, Ray complies. Mann turns his face toward the
          passenger side window. Ray's mouth dries up. He has no
          idea what Mann will do.
          The Policeman scrutinizes the license, turns it over to
          look for convictions, and checks Ray's face against the
          felonlike photo. Then he looks at Mann.

          They walk through the indoor portion of the grandstand
          toward their section.

          So what do you do with yourself these
          days?

          I live. I work. I've learned to cook.

          I was the East Coast distributor of
          'involved.'. I ate it, drank it, and
          breathed it. Then they killed Martin.
          They killed Bobby. And then they
          elected Tricky Dick. Twice. And now,
          people like you think I must be
          miserable that I'm not involved anymore.
          Well, I've got news for you: I spent all
          my misery years ago. I have no more
          pain for any of you. I gave at the
          office.
          They approach the refreshment stand.

          So...what do you want?

          . MANN
          I want them to stop looking to me for
          answers. Begging me to speak again,
          write again, be a leader. I want them
          to start thinking for themselves. And
          I want my privacy!
          Ray looks slightly embarrassed.

                         RAY
          No, I meant what do you want from...
          Ray points to the hot dog vendor, as they have reached the
          front of the line.

          Okay, I agree, you should be entitled
          to as much privacy as you wane. But why
          stop writing?

          Ray and Mann emerge into the sunlight and walk down the
          aisle toward the field.

                         RAY
          God, this place is so beautiful.
          The grass is so green you can almost smell it. Looking
          around the old ballpark, they see only about twenty or
          thirty die-hard fans in the stands for batting practice;
          a half-dozen players are grouped around the batting cage
          as one player hits to several others in the field. A few
          sportswriters and other civilians stand near the dugouts.
          Ray and Mann stop at the first row, right behind the Red
          Sox on-deck circle, lean on the railing and talk.

                         RAY
          It could be 1912 out there, for all this
          place has changed. Babe Ruth stood on
          that very mound as a pitcher long before
          anyone knew he could hit home runs.
          Same mound.

                         MANN
          Why are we here, Ray?

                         RAY

          93 THE GAME - NIGHT

                         93
          The game is in progress. Ray and Mann are in their fifth
          row seats. They do not speak.
          At one point, Ray becomes suddenly and strangely aware that
          something is about to happen. He looks at Mann who is just
          watching the game. Then he looks at the scoreboard.

                         94 THE SCOREBOARD 94
          Fenway Park has a sophisticated scoreboard that flashes
          pictures of the batter and pitcher, and can show instant
          replays of some of the action.

                         94
          Right now, the display is replaced by an oddly glowing
          message. The sounds of the stadium, the game, and the
          crowd fade out.
          There is only the message:

          ARCHIBALD "MOONLIGHT" GRAHAM
          Chisholm, Minn.
          New York Giants

                         LIFETIME STATISTICS:
          1 Game, 0 At Bats
          The message does not just glow, it pulsates. It looks
          almost otherworldly, phosphorescent; clearly unlike
          anything ever seen before on a ballpark scoreboard.

          95 RAY AND MANN

                         95
          Ray looks around him. The sounds of the game return, and
          from the unconcerned faces of the people near him, he
          realizes that no one else can see the message. He opens
          his program and starts writing it down. Mann notices this,
          but cannot see what Ray is writing.
          Then Ray hears The Voice.

                         THE VOICE
          'Go the distance.'

                         RAY

          Mann looks at Ray curiously, trying to read this new
          attitude.

                         MANN
          Then let's go.
          Mann rises and heads up the aisle. Ray looks down at the
          program -- at the handwritten legend of Moonlight Graham,
          who played one game fifty-seven years ago, but did not get
          to bat -- and follows Mann out of the ballpark.

                         MANN
          I already think you're crazy. What did
          it say?
          After a little thought, Ray smiles sadly.

                         RAY
          It said 'The man's done enough. Leave
          him alone.'
          Ray puts the car in gear, makes a wide turn, and starts to
          head back up the street. But he stops short when Mann's
          form looks out of the darkness into the glare of the
          headlights..
          Ray does not know why Mann is blocking his path. Or why
          he appears tense, almost frightened.

                         MANN

          Ray opens the passenger door of the Datsun and Mann jumps
          in. Ray releases the brake and peels out, burning rubber.

          They are north of Duluth,andthelandscape hasgrown
          harsher, the trees shorterandmore gnarled, thegrass
          tougher and wirier.
          After Virginia, Minnesota, all the land is scarred. Above
          the town the mines sit like sand-colored bunkers in the
          cliffs,- stern and silent.
          Near Chisholm, the land is getting ever weirder. It looks
          like a pasture rooted and rerooted by giant hogs. It has
          been split and gutted; greenery has grown back, but at
          weird and unnatural angles.
          But as they swing into town; the highway divides and they
          cross a beautiful and tranquil lake, so smooth and shiny
          it might be a scene painted on a glass plate. A sign reads

                         ELDERLY MAN
          Who's that?

                         RAY
          My name is Ray Kinsella. I'm from Iowa.
          Are you Moonlight Graham?
          The old man narrows his bright eyes to see Ray more
          clearly.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          No one's called me 'Moonlight' Graham
          for fifty years.

                         RAY
          Well, I've come...

                         (SMILES TO

                         HIMSELF)
          . a very long way to see you.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          Funny. I couldn't sleep tonight.
          Usually, I sleep like a baby. So I told
          Alicia I was going to take a walk.

                         RAY
          Mind if i join you? I'd like to talk
          to you.
          Doc nods and they start to walk.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          Let's go to the high school. We can sit
          in my office. What do. you want to talk
          about?

                         RAY
          Well, first of all, how'd you get to be
          called 'Moonlight'?

                         DOC GRAHAM
          'Cause of a night like this, long ago.
          I'd just gotten to the minors, and I
          went out to the ballpark.

          There's nothing as peaceful as a
          ballpark at night. Like a church.

                         RAY
          Yeah, I know what you mean.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          Anyway, I fell asleep. Next morning,
          they found me in the on-deck circle, all
          curled up like a baby. Someone called
          me 'Moonlight,' and it stuck.

          122 EXT. HIGH SCHOOL 122

          Doc fumbles out a key, and lets them in.

                         RAY
          When you got to the majors, you played
          only one inning of one game. What
          happened in that inning?

          123 INT. HIGH SCHOOL 123

          They enter the hallway of the old school, the smell of
          varnish and chalk almost palpable.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          It was the last day of the season.
          Bottom of the eighth, and we were way
          ahead. I'd been up with the club for
          most of a month, but hadn't seen any
          action. Just then old John McGraw
          points a bony finger at me and says
          'Right field.' Well sir, I jumped up
          like I was sitting on a spring, grabbed
          my glove, and ran out onto the field.
          They reach a varnished door with an opaque glass inset, and
          enter. Doc Graham's office.

          124 INT.,DOC GRAHAM'S OFFICE 124

          Doc seats himself behind a cluttered desk, and motions Ray
          to the black-leather sofa a few feet away.

                         RAY
          Did you get to make a play?
          Doc takes a sheet of paper off his desk, expertly rips an
          inch or so off the corner with his teeth, and begins
          chewing.

          Nope. They never hit the ball out of
          the infield.
          Ray chuckles, but then flinches as Doc shoots his little
          spitball towards him.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          Heads up.
          It hits the back of the sofa a few feet from Ray, and hangs
          there, like a white fly.

                         RAY
          I was warned about you.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          Anyway, one inning later the game was
          over, and so was I.

                         RAY
          And what was that like?

                         DOC GRAHAM
          It was like coming this close to your
          dreams, and then watching them brush
          past you like a stranger in a crowd.
          Ray nods, and a look of understanding begins to appear on
          his face. He looks out the window, focused on faraway.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          Except, at the time, you don't think
          much of it. Hardly anybody recognizes
          the most significant moment of their
          life when they're happening. Back then
          I just figured there'd be plenty more
          days. I didn't know that would be the
          only one.
          Doc Graham notices that Ray is looking very serious.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          Now, let me ask you a question, Ray
          Kinsella. What makes that half-inning
          so interesting that you come all the way
          from Iowa to ask me about it sixty-five
          years later?
          Ray chooses his words carefully.

                         RAY
          I didn't really know till just now. But
          I think it's to ask you if you could do
          anything you wanted to...if you could
          have a wish...

                         DOC GRAHAM
          Ahh...
          Doc nods. his understanding. He smiles wryly, takes a new
          piece of paper, and bites off a little section.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          And are you the kind of man who could
          grant me that wish?

                         RAY
          I don't know. I'm just asking...
          Doc leans his left elbow on the desk and rubs his forehead
          thoughtfully with a palm, as if it were an eraser that
          could erase the years and take him back to 1929 and the
          Polo Grounds in New York.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          I never got to bat in the major leagues.
          I'd have liked the chance -- just once
          -- to stare down a big league pitcher.
          Stare him down and then just as he goes
          into the windup -- wink! Make him
          wonder if I know something he doesn't.
          That's what I wish for. The chance to
          squint my eyes when the sky is so blue
          it hurts to look at it, and to feel the
          'tingle that runs up your arms when you
          connect dead-on. The chance to run the
          bases, stretch a double to a triple, and
          flop race-first into third, wrapping my
          arm around the bag. That's my wish, Ray
          Kinsella... that's my wish.
          Ray begins to smile. Graham is staring intently at him.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          Is there enough magic floating around
          in the night out there for you to make
          that wish come true?

                         RAY
          What would you do if I said 'Yes'?

                         DOC GRAHAM

          There is a place where things like that
          happen. And if you want to go there,
          I can take you.
          Doc's eyes start to glisten, and he offers an embarrassed
          smile as he wipes away a tear.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          If it means leaving Chisholm...
          He shakes his head.no. Ray is surprised.

                         RAY
          I understand, but I think you're
          supposed to come with us.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          This is my most special place in the
          world, Ray. Once a place touches you
          like this, the wind never blows so cold
          again. You feel for it like it was your
          child. I can't leave here.
          Ray cannot believe the man won't leave Chisholm for his
          dream.

                         RAY
          But your wish...

                         DOC GRAHAM
          It'll stay one. I was born here, lived
          here, and I'll die here. That's okay.
          I'll have no regrets.

                         RAY
          But sixty-five years ago -- for five
          minutes -- you came this close.
          (holds up two

                         FINGERS)
          It would kill some men to get that close
          to their dream and never touch it.
          They'd consider it a tragedy.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          Son...if I'd only gotten to be a doctor
          for five minutes. .now that would have
          been a tragedy.

          the couch.

          Archie sleeps in the backseat.

                         MANN
          I'm dying to ask him if he has a
          nickname.

                         RAY
          Don't. He didn't get it till he was in
          the minors.

                         MANN
          Maybe we can give it to him.

                         RAY
          Funny, the way he described towns,
          finding you a job so you can play on
          their team...they haven't done that for
          years. My Dad did that for a while.
          But that was in the Twenties.

                         MANN
          What happened to your father?

                         RAY
          He never made it as ball player, so he
          tried to get his son to make it for him.
          By the time I was ten, playing baseball
          got to be like eating vegetables or
          taking out the garbage, so when I was
          fourteen, I started to refuse. Can you
          believe that? An American boy refusing
          to have a catch with his father.

                         MANN
          Why at fourteen?

                         RAY
          That's when I read The Boat Rocker, by
          Terence Mann.

          Oh God.

                         RAY
          I never played catch with him again.

                         (SERIOUSLY)
          See, that's the kind of crap people are
          always trying to lay on me. It's not
          my fault you wouldn't play catch with

          I know. Anyway, when I was seventeen,
          we had a big fight, I packed my things,
          said something awful, and left. After
          a while I wanted to come home, but I
          didn't know how. I made it back for the
          funeral.

                         MANN
          What was the awful thing you said?

                         RAY
          I said I could never respect a man whose
          hero was a criminal.

          Mann considers this all very carefully.

          You knew he wasn't a criminal.
          Ray nods.

          Well now we know what everybody's
          purpose here is...except mine.
          Ray looks at him. He hadn't thought of that. After a few
          moments Ray points to something in the distance.

          Something down the road, in the midst of all this flat
          farmland, is glowing in the night.
          It is an illuminated baseball diamond in a cornfield.

          131 RAY AND ANNIE'S FARM - NIGHT
          Ray turns the Datsun into the long driveway and, with a
          rumble, crosses the metal cattle guard that keeps livestock
          from escaping to the roadway.
          He eases the car to a stop in front of the house, and as
          the three men unfold themselves from the car, Karin bolts
          from the back door of the house, a blur of white blouse and
          pink pedal pushers. She flings herself into Ray's arms,
          and hugs his neck in unrestrained joy.

                         KARIN
          Daddy!
          Then Annie appears too. They kiss while Mann and Archie
          wait to be introduced. Finally, Mann clears his throat.

          Annie steps forward, wining some curls from her eyes with
          ahand that has recently been immersed in flour'. She
          smiles, wipes the hand on the thigh of her jeans, and
          shakes his hand.

          Ray and Annie walk silently with their arms around each
          other as they lead Mann, Archie and Karin to the bleachers.
          Mann's eyes widen as several of the players shout greetings
          to Ray.

          Ray, I hope you don't mind, but we got
          tired of just having practices, so we
          brought another team out with us so we
          could have some real games.
          He points to the visitors' bench, and, indeed, there are
          a dozen or so more old-time baseball players in old-time
          baseball uniforms.

                         RAY
          I don't mind. Where'd they come from?

          Karin beams. Ray taps Mann and points to the plate.

          Look.
          Archie Graham -- now wearing a Giant's uniform -- drops one
          of the two bats he has been swinging in the on-deck circle,
          and advances on the plate, slashing the air with a
          brand-new bat the color of vanilla ice cream. He plants
          himself in the batter's b.ox, then cocks the bat, the top
          end of it trembling as if he were stirring something, and
          waits for the pitch.'
          The pitcher looks in for his signs. Archie stares back.
          As the pitcher goes into his windup, Archie winks at him.
          There is a moment of confusion and then anger on the
          pitcher's face, and when the ball speeds to the plate it
          is aimed right at Archie's head. He dives out of the way
          and hits the dirt hard. The Catcher chuckles through his
          mask.

                         CATCHER
          Good thing for you that wasn't his
          fastball.
          Archie digs in again at the plate, but backs up just a
          little. Now his look to the pitcher is one of
          determination.

                         ARCHIE
          Come on, let's see your fastball.
          The pitcher smiles, winds up and throws. Very fast. And
          right at Archie's chin. Again, he has to dive out of the
          way. This time, however, he gets right up and immediately
          appeals to the Umpire.

                         ARCHIE °
          Hey, ump, how about a warning?

                         UMPIRE
          Sure. Watch out-you don't get killed.
          Both benches laugh at that. Archie holds up his hands to
          call time, and steps out of the batter's box. The on-deck
          batter, Mel Ott, comes over.

          But watch out for 'in your ear.'
          Archie takes his place in the batter's box again. He still
          looks determined, but a little less cocky. The next pitch
          is a curve that looks as if it's heading right for him.
          But he holds his ground, and when the ball breaks down and
          away, he steps in, snaps the bat forward, and hits it.
          The ball sails in a high arc to right center. The center
          fielder backs up a couple of steps, lopes a few strides to
          his left, and makes the catch.
          Archie is out, but the runner on third tags up and scores.
          As Archie curls across the diamond from the first baseline
          to the Giants' bench, he hears cheering.
          In the stands, Ray, Annie, Karin and Mann are giving him
          a standing ovation. In return, he touches the brim of his
          cap, a ballplayer's cool response to adulation.

                         (LAUGHS)
          •Look at that. Mr. Cool.
          But when Archie gets to the bench, he can't contain himself
          anymore. He leaps up and lets out a cheer of pure joy.

          The game has ended, and players are rough-housing and
          joking as they slowly make their way to the door in the
          outfield fence. Ray and Mann are talking to some of the
          players over the fence.

          I'd love to go with you sometime.
          The silence that follows is long and ominous.

                         RAY
          I'd like to see what's out there.
          There is still no response.

                         RAY
          I'll take that as a no for now.
          He spots Archie jogging off the field.

          Archie jogs over.

          rest of the players. When he reaches the fence, he turns
          back to them.

                         ARCHIE
          Mr. Kinsella?
          Ray turns toward him. Archie looks as if he knows more
          than he's saying.

                         ARCHIE
          Thank you for bringing me here. I
          couldn't have wished for anything more.
          Ray recognizes there may be more behind those words than
          just a teenager's pleasure. But he decides not to ask any
          questions.

                         RAY
          I know. You're welcome.

          Either way we lose the farm. Maybe we
          can make it a condition of the sale that
          they keep the field up.

          stops as he walks right across it, completely mindless of
          the players. Since he doesn't see any of them, a few
          actually have to move out of his way. He approaches the
          bottom of the bleachers.

          It'll be like one of those tiny, French
          restaurants that have no sign. You find
          it by instinct. They'll be drawn.

          Okay, this is all fascinating, but the
          fact remains that you don't have the
          money to bring the mortgage up to date,
          so you still have to sell. I'm sorry,
          but you have no choice.
          He produces a document and hands it to Ray with a pen. Ray
          looks at it. He doesn't know what to do.

          People will come, Ray. They'll come to
          Iowa for reasons they can't even fathom.
          They'll turn up your driveway, not
          knowing for sure why they're doing it,
          and arrive at your door, innocent as
          children, longing for the past. 'Of
          course we won't mind if you look
          around,' you'll say. 'It's only twenty
          dollars per person.' And they'll pass
          over the money without even looking at
          it. For it is money they have, and
          peace they lack.

          Spellbound, Ray has put the papers down. Mark picks them
          up again. He is battling Mann for Ray's attention.

                         MARK

          The one constant through all the years,
          Ray, has been baseball. America has
          rolled by like an`army of steamrollers.
          It's been erased like a blackboard,
          rebuilt, and erased again. But baseball
          has marked the time. This field, this °
          game... it's a piece of our past. It
          reminds us of all that once was good.
          And that could be again. People will
          come. People will most definitely come.
          Mann has moved everyone (but Mark) with the beauty of his
          words, and the passion in his.voice. Behind him, the
          assembled ballplayers respectfully applaud.

          The players on either side of him jab his ribs with their
          elbows, but Mann, Ray and Annie laugh with pleasure.

                         MARK
          Ray. You will lose everything and you
          will be evicted.
          Ray looks at the paper with dread. He looks at Shoeless
          Joe and the players. He looks at his family. Then he
          turns back to Mark. It's decision time.

                         RAY
          I'm not signing.
          Mark shakes his head sadly. Annie hugs Ray. The players
          breathe a great sigh of relief. Mann smiles.

                         MANN
          Ray...
          Ray looks up at Mann, who, with a gentle tilt of the head,
          directs Ray's attention to the house. Ray looks behind him
          toward the house.

          142 RAY'S POINT OF VIEW - CARS 142
          have parked in front of the house. More are coming quietly
          down the driveway. Dozens of cars. Cars with out-of-state
          license plates.
          Some people,have gotten out of their cars and wait
          patiently. One or two families sit on their hoods, or have
          set up picnic dinners on their station wagons' tailgates.

                         143 THE BLEACHERS 143
           Ray, Annie, Karin and Mann are deeply happy -- but not
           terribly surprised -- to see these people.

                         KARIN
          It's not nothing.
          Mark grabs Karin's arm and pulls her to her feet as if she
          were "Exhibit A."

                         MARK
          And you've turned your daughter into a
          goddamn moron!

                         RAY
          Get your hands off her.
          Ray rises threateningly, and Mark turns toward him. In so
          doing, he twists little Karin off balance.

                         MARK
          I'm trying to help you, goddamnit!
          In that split second, they hear a strangled gasp, and see
          Karin falling forward from the top row of the bleachers.

                         RA Y

          Her hot dog flies off, the bun and wiener separating in
          midair. One small sandal bounces end over end and lands
          at the foot of the bleacher. It takes forever for her body
          to come down with a sickening thud on the hard green boards
          of one of the bottom rows.

          rush down to where she lies, face up. Ray is first, but
          he does not know what to do. Annie and Mann hover. Mark
          is horror-stricken, but no one knows what to do.

                         MARK
          Oh my God, I'm sorry...Annie...I didn't
          mean to...
          Karin is unconscious, and seems to be fighting for breath.
          Ray and Annie's eyes meet in anguish.

                         ANNIE
          Should we move her?

                         RAY

          Is there a doctor? A nurse? Any of
          you?
          They sadly shake their heads no. Annie races inside.

                         147
          Most of the White Sox players stand by the left field
          fence, staring silently.

          Its a twenty-minute drive.
          Mann winces. He knows that could be fatal. Ray kneels by
          Karin. Her nose and one side of her face have been scraped
          by the fall. Blood starts to trickle from her nose, across
          her cheek and down her neck. She is becoming bluer and her
          cough is faint, as though she is in another room.

          Mark takes off his $300 pale-green velvet corduroy jacket
          and is wordlessly holding it out to Ray. Ray takes the
          jacket and covers Karin gently.
          Karin is getting paler, bluer, and her breathing more
          strained and distant.

                         RAY
          Karin...
          Then, without reason, Ray slowly turns toward the field.
          The White Sox stand near him by the fence, the Giants stay
          around their bench. All except one: young Archie Graham.

                         148 ARCHIE GRAHAM

                         148
          has noticed the'commotion in the bleachers, and he starts
          to lope across the field.

                         149 BLEACHERS

                         149
          Annie has pulled the car over and honks. Ray holds up his
          hand to her to wait. His eyes are on young Archie Graham.

          150 YOUNG ARCHIE GRAHAM

           3.50
           As Graham gets closer, his features begin to change, and
           his step slows. He reaches the end of the fence -- around
           which no player can pass
          -- and when he emerges from the
          shadows on the bleachers side, he is no longer young
          Moonlight Graham, the ballplayer of long ago...but Doc
          Graham, the old man from Chisholm, Minnesota. His baseball
          glove has turned into a black doctor's bag.

                         RAY

          Doc kneels beside her and instantly knows what is wrong.

          He picks her up with one hand under her shoulders and the
          other under her knees, seats himself on the bleachers, and
          turns her face down. Supporting her chest with one hand,
          he delivers a series of sharp blows between her shoulder
          blades with the heel of his other hand.
          Annie honks again. Ray waves her to him. Mark cannot
          believe what he is seeing.
          Suddenly, Karin's diaphragm expands as she sucks in air.
          Doc reaches around and pries her mouth open, releasing a
          sizable piece of hog dog and bun.
          As he turns her over, we can see the blueness disappearing
          from her face as she continues to breathe deeply. Doc
          peels back each eyelid in turn, stares at the pupil for a
          few seconds, and lets the eye close.

                         DCC GRAHAM
          She's okay. I don't think the fall
          really hurt her, just the dog in her
          throat. She'll be coming around in a
          minute or two.

                         RAY

          No, son. Thank you.
          It just now sinking for Ray what-Doc Graham has sacrificed
          to save the child. Ray looks to the field, and then back
          at the Doctor.

                         RAY
          'Oh, my God, you can't go back.

          Mark is slack-jawed. He has seen something magical happen

                         SHOELESS JOE
          Hev rookie!
          Doc Graham turns.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          You were good.
          Only now do Doc Graham's eyes shine with tears. He smiles,
          and disappears through the door.

          154 ON THE SIDE

                         154
          Karin is coming to, Ray and Annie by her side. Some of the
          players start to gather up their equipment. Shoeless Joe
          calls to Ray.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          We're gonna call it a night. We'll see
          you tomorrow.

                         RAY
          Okay.

           Good night.
           Joe starts to trot off the field, then he stops and turns
           back to the bleachers.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          Hey! You wanna come with us?
          Ray's jaw drops.

                         RAY
          You mean it?

                         SHOELESS JOE
          Not you.
          (points to Mann)
          Him.

                         RAY
          Him?

                         MANN
          Come with you?

                         SHOELESS JOE
          Out there.

                         MANN
          What is out there?

                         SHOELESS JOE
          Come find out.

                         RAY
          Wait a second. Why him?
          Shoeless Joe and the other players wait for Mann to join
          them, ignoring Ray's question.

                         RAY
          I built this field! You wouldn't be
          here if it weren't for me.

                         MANN
          Ray, for God's sake, I'm unattached.
          You've got a family.
          This takes Ray down a peg or two.

                         RAY
          But I want to know what's out there! I
          want to see it!

          There's a reason they chose me, just as
          there was a reason they chose you to
          find me.

                         RAY
          Oh yeah? Why?

                         MANN
          Because, you big jerk, I gave that
          interview.

                         RAY
          What interview?

                         MANN
          The one about Ebbets Field. The one
          that charged you up and sent you all the
          way to Boston to find me.

                         RAY
          Then you lied to me.

                         MANN
          You were kidnapping me at the time, you
          asshole! Think of it, Ray: maybe
          there's an Ebbets Field still floating
          around out there somewhere. And maybe
          I'll get to sit in the stands, and watch
          a twenty-year-old kid with a smooth face
          and kinky hair try out for the 1948
          Dodgers.

                         RAY
          (to Shoeless Joe)
          So I do all the work, and all I get is
          to see everybody else's dreams come
          true. Is that it?

                         SHOELESS JOE
          What are you saying, Ray?

                         RAY
          I'm saying I'm happy for you, and I'm
          happy for him, but after all
          this what's in it L for me?

                         SHOELESS JOE
          Is that why you did this? For-you?

                         MANN
          There's something out there for me, Ray.
          And what a story it'll make: a man
          being able to touch the perfect dream.

          You bet I will.
          Annie walks Karin over. Ray bends down to Karin's face.

                         RAY
          How you feeling, honey?

                         KARIN
          Stupid.
          Ray laughs and hugs her. He looks up at Annie.

                         RAY
          Terry's been invited to go-with the
          players.

                         ANNIE

          Doo-doo-doo-doo. Be careful.
          She smiles brightly and gives Mann a kiss on the cheek.
          Mann shakes Ray's hand.

                         RAY--
          I want a full description.

                         MANN

          156 BACK AT THE FIELD

          2.56
          Only a few players are left on the field.

                         RAY
          We're keeping this field.

                         ANNIE
          You bet your ass we are.
          Ray realizes Shoeless Joe is staring at him, with a
          shit-eating grin on his face.

                         RAY
          What..
          Shoeless Joe just keeps smiling.

                         RAY
          What're you grinning at, you ghost?

                         SHOELESS JOE
          'If you build it...
          He nods toward where the catcher is taking off his gear at home plate.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          ' .he will come.'
          Ray looks at the Catcher. The hairs on the back of his
          neck begin to stand up.

                         RAY
          Oh, my God.

                         ANNIE
          What is it?

          157 THE YOUNG CATCHER
          has taken off his mask. He is in his early twenties. He
          is in the same pose as the photo we saw in the prologue.

          158 RAY AND SHOELESS JOE
          Ray blanches and turns to Shoeless Joe, his voice a
          strangled whisper.

                         RAY
          Say it ain't so,- Joe.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          I'm afraid it is, kid.
          The Catcher is now walking toward Ray.

                         RAY

                         (FINALLY

                         UNDERSTANDING)
          'Ease his pain...'

                         SHOELESS JOE
          (smiles and nods)
          'Go the distance.'
          When he says those words, Shoeless Joe sounds just like The
          Voice.

                         RAY
          It was you.

           No, Ray. It was you.
           Shoeless joe winks and walks away, disappearing through the
           door in the outfield fence.

          160 RAY AND ANNIE

                         160
          The Catcher is halfway across the field. Ray turns to
          Annie. He cannot even swallow.

                         RAY
          My God, I only saw him later, when he
          was worn down by life. Look at him.
          The young Catcher has reached the outfield grass. Ray
          walks down to the edge of the outfield.

          and I'm not even a glint in his eye.
          What do I say to him?

                         ANNIE
          Introduce him to his granddaughter.
          Ray cannot believe how wonderful Annie is. The Catcher has
          reached the edge of the field, and now stands before Ray
          and Annie.

                         CATCHER
          Hi, I just wanted to thank you folks for
          putting up the field and letting us play
          here. I'm John Kinsella.
          They shake his hand.

                         RAY
          I'm Ray. My wife Annie. And this is
          my daughter, Karin.

          We're going to let you two talk. I have
          to go look after our guests. Someone's
          gotta start collecting admission if
          we're going to keep this place.
          (to the Catcher)
          Very nice meeting you.

          watch them for a while, then start to,stroll across the
          field.

                         RAY
          You catch a good game.

                         JOHN
          Thank you. It's so beautiful here. Its
          like-well for me, it's like a dream
          come true.
          Ray cannot speak. He nods.

                         JOHN
          Can I ask you something?
          Again, Ray nods.

                         JOHN
          Is this heaven?
          Ray smiles and shakes his head no.

                         RAY
          It's Iowa.

                         JOHN
          Iowa. I could've sworn this was heaven.

                         16 3
          stops and looks intently at John. He asks this question
          as if he were asking the secret of life. Maybe he is.

                         RAY
          Is there a heaven?

                         164 JOHN

                         164
          takes time to answer that. He looks up at the night sky
          and searches it.

                         JOHN
          Oh, yeah...
          Then he looks square into Ray's eyes.

                         JOHN
          Heaven's where dreams come true.

          looks toward the house and sees his wife and daughter on
          the veranda, a moon bright as butter silvering the night
          above them. He smiles. He finally understands. He turns
          back to John and nods.

                         RAY
          Then maybe this is heaven.

          fence.

                         RAY
          Hey!
          John turns back. Ray is holding a ball.

                         RAY
          You wanna have a catch?
          John closes his eyes for a second, and when he opens them;
          there is the hint of moisture. Does he know Ray is his
          son?

                         JOHN
          I'd like that.

          Ray tosses him the ball, picks up a glove lying there, and
          puts it on.

          They throw the ball back and forth.

          And as we pull up higher and higher we see a father and son
          bathed by white floodlights and car headlights... on the
          silent, satiny green of a baseball diamond at the edge of
          a cornfield.

                         FADE OUT

                         THE END
