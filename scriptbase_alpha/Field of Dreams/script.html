</b>          My father’s name was John Kinsella.
          A faded, sepia shot of a dirty little kid on a farm.

<b>          RAY (V.O.)
</b>          It’s an Irish name. He was born in
          North Dakota, in 1896...
          Young man in doughboy uniform.

<b>          RAY (V.O.)
</b>          ...and never saw a big city until he
          came back from France in 1918.
          Chicago. Tenement. Comiskey Park. Ballgames.

<b>          RAY (V.O.)
</b>          He settled in Chicago, where he quickly
          learned to live and die with the White
          Sox. Died a little when they lost the
          1919 World Series...

<b>          RAY (V.O.)
</b>          ...died a lot the following summer when
          eight members of the team were accused
          of throwing that Series.
          Dad (a catcher) playing ball. At work. Weeding.

<b>          RAY (V.O.)
</b>          He played in the minors for a year or
          two, but nothing ever came of it. Moved
          to Brooklyn in ’35, married Mom in ’38,
          and was already an old man working at
          the Naval Yards when I was born in 1949.
          Ray as an infant. With his father. In front of Ebbets Field
          in miniature Dodger uniform, etc.

<b>          RAY (V.O.)
</b>          My name’s Ray Kinsella. Mom died when
          I was three, and I suppose Dad did the
          best he could. Instead of Mother Goose,
          I was put to bed at night to stories of

</b>          Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig...and the great
          Shoeless Joe Jackson. Dad was a Yankees
          fan then, so of course I rooted for
          Brooklyn. But in '58 the Dodgers moved
          away, so we had to find other things to
          fight about. We did. And when it came
          time to go to college, I picked the
          farthest one from home I could find.
          Berkeley in the 1960s: hippies, protesters, etc.

<b>          RAY (V.0.)
</b>          This, of course, drove him right up the
          wail, which I suppose was the point.
          Officially my major was English, but
          really it was the Sixties.

<b>          RAY (V.O.)
</b>          I marched, I smoked some grass, I tried
          to like sitar music... and I met Annie.
          Annie: blue jeans, T-shirt, freckles. Their courtship.

<b>          RAY (V.0.)
</b>          The only thing we had in common was that
          she came from Iowa and I had once heard
          of Iowa. We moved in together. After
          graduation, we moved to the Midwest, and
          stayed with her family as long as we
          could.
          Unsmiling American Gothic types.

<b>          RAY (V.O.)
</b>          Almost a full afternoon.
          The apartment, Ray at different jobs, the wedding.

<b>          RAY (V.0.)
</b>          We rented an apartment and I took a job
          selling insurance. I also drove a cab
          and worked in a pizza parlor. Dad died
          in June of 1 74. Annie and I got married
          that fail.

<b>          RAY (V.O.)
</b>          A few years later Karin was born. She
          smelled weird, but we loved her anyway.
          Then Annie got the crazy idea that she
          could talk me into buying a farm.

          their farm. Ray in a cornfield.

</b>          I'm thirty-eight years old and I'm about
          to become a farmer. I love my family,
          I love baseball, and I miss New York.
          Moving in on Ray's face.

<b>          RAY (V.0.)
</b>          But until I heard The Voice...I'd never
          done a crazy thing in my whole life.

<b>          2 THE CORNFIELD - DUSK
</b>
<b>                         2
</b>          It is dusk on a spring evening. The sky is a robin's-egg
          blue, and the wind is soft as a day-old chick. Ray
          Kinsella is working in the cornfield when a voice -- like
          that of a public address announcer -- speaks to him.

<b>                         THE VOICE
</b>          'If you build it, he will come.'
          Ray looks up and around, but sees nothing that could be the
          source of this sound. All around him are empty fields.
          He stands quietly for a few moments, then goes back to
          work.

<b>                         THE VOICE
</b>          'If you build it, he will come.'
          Ray jerks his head in all directions to see where this
          voice is coming from, but again, he sees nothing unusual
          -- just the furrowed fields and a few hundred feet away,
          the massive old farmhouse with a sagging veranda on three
          sides. On the north veranda is a wooden porch swing where
          Annie and Karin sit, sipping lemonade and dreaming.

</b>          That voice.

<b>                         ANNIE
</b>          What voice?

<b>                         RAY
</b>          Just now. Like an announcement.
          Annie confers briefly with Karin, then calls back to Ray.

<b>                         ANNIE
</b>          We didn't hear anything.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          Oh.
          Ray thinks for a second, then shakes it off, trying to
          dislodge that thought from his mind, and gets back to work.

<b>                         THE VOICE
</b>          'If you build it, he will come.'
          Again, he bolts upright and looks around. Again, he sees
          nothing. This is beginning to bug him. He calls:

<b>                         RAY
</b>          Okay, you must've heard that.

<b>          3 ON THE PORCH
</b>
<b>                         3
</b>          Annie and Karin lock at each other and exchange a shrug.
          Annie extends her arms palms upward, and calls to Ray.

<b>                         ANNIE
</b>          Sorry. Come on. Dinner.
          Annie leads Karin inside.

<b>          4 -IN THE FIELD
</b>
<b>                         4
</b>          Ray looks all around him with an "Okay, fellas, what's the
          joke?" look on his face. But there is no one there. He
          puts down his tools and walks toward the house.

<b>          5 INT. KITCHEN
</b>
          Ray enters, looks at his wife skeptically and joins his
          wife and daughter setting the table.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          Was there like a sound truck on the
          highway, or something?

<b>                         ANNIE

<b>                         RAY
</b>          I always felt cheated I never got to see
          him play. He was supposed to be so

          to see him play again...to let him play
          again, to right an old wrong...
          He shakes his head in wonder just to think of it. Annie
          turns on the light.

          why I should,-but...
          (takes a breath)
          I'm thirty-eight years old, I have a
          wife, a child, and a mortgage, and I'm
          scared to death I'm turning into my
          father.

<b>                         ANNIE
</b>          What's your father got to do with this?
          Ray tries to picture his father in his mind. He speaks
          softly, but the words obviously have a great deal of
          meaning for him.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          I never forgave him for getting old.
          By the time he'was as old as I am now,
          he was ancient. He must have had
          dreams, but he never did anything about
          them. For all I know, he may have even
          heard voices, too, but he sure didn't
          listen to them. The man never did one
          spontaneous thing in all the years I
          knew him. Annie, I'm scared that that's
          what growing up means. I'm afraid of
          that happening to me. And something
          tells me this may be my last chance to
          do something about it.
          (looks at her)
          I want to build that field. Do you
          think I'm crazy?
          She looks at him with great understanding.

<b>                         ANNIE
</b>          Yes.
          He smiles wanly. She touches his face lovingly.

<b>                         ANNIE
</b>          I also think that if you feel you really
          have to do this... then you should do it.
          They hold each other's gaze, and Ray cannot remember when
          he has loved her so much. He takes her in his arms.
          Outside their window, the field of corn lies waiting.

          onto the porch and flicks the switch shutting off the
          floodlights over the field.

</b>          We'll put up some coffee. You go ahead.
          Ray takes a breath and steps out onto the veranda. The
          night sky seems close enough to touch.

<b>                         51
</b>          On the porch wall, Ray finds the switch, holds his breath,
          flicks it and the floodlights sputter to life.

</b>
<b>                         52
</b>          steps onto the field. On his uniform is a large "S" with
          an "O" in the top crook, an "X" in the bottom, and an
          American flag with forty-eight stars on his left sleeve.

</b>
<b>                         54
</b>          Moving closer to the field we see the Man standing out in
          left field. Feet spread wide, body bent forward from the
          waist, hands on hips, he waits.

</b>
<b>                         55

          of the bats lying beside the pail of hard balls. The back
          of his neck tingles. Then, he picks up one of the balls.

<b>          56 IN THE OUTFIELD

</b>          The Man spreads his feet, pounds his small, old-style
          glove, and waits to field the ball.

<b>          57 AT HOME PLATE 57
</b>          Ray tosses the ball a few feet into the air and swings at
          it. And misses. His face reddens, he clears his throat,
          and tries again. This time he connects.

<b>                         58 THE FIELD 58
</b>          He has hit a grounder that would be easily fielded by a
          shortstop had there been one, but it bounces through and
          falls into left field. The Man runs in for it, scoops it
          up cleanly and throws it back to the plate.
          Ray is thrilled. He hits another ground ball, and this
          too, is fielded cleanly. Then another, which the Man
          deftly short-hops. Ray hollers out to him.

<b>                         RAY

<b>                         THE MAN
</b>          It's good. The ball bounces true.
          Ray smiles with pride. He tosses up another ball, gives
          it his best swing, and is thrilled to see he has actually
          lofted one into the air. But into center field. The Man
          sprints across the outfield, and makes a lovely catch in
          short center. Instead of throwing the ball in, the Man
          runs it in, loping toward home plate. Ray's heart thumps.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          Hi.
          The Man nods at him, takes the bat, and tests it to feel
          its weight.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          Ray Kinsella.

<b>                         THE MAN
</b>          Joe Jackson.
          Ray is thrilled to hear the words spoken. It is Shoeless
          Joe Jackson after all, who stands not five feet away from
          him, trying out all the bats now. Ray isn't quite sure if
          he should talk, or ask questions, or just stand there.
          Finally, he can't help himself.

<b>                         RAY

          his steady voice tries to conceal.

<b>                         SHOELESS JOE
</b>          I've heard that old man wake up and
          scratch itchy legs that've been dust for
          fifty years. That was me. I'd wake up
          in the night with the smell of the
          ballpark in my nose and the cool of the
          grass on my feet. The thrill of the
          grass...
          He has found the bat he likes.

<b>                         SHOELESS JOE

</b>          Yeah, I'm not bad.
          Joe hands Ray the bucket of balls. Ray can barely contain
          his excitement as he races to the mound. He stands on the
          rubber and faces Joe at the plate.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          Don't we need a catcher?

<b>                         SHOELESS JOE
</b>          Not if you can get it near the plate,
          we don't.
          Ray smiles, takes a breath and starts his windup, during
          which he says aloud to himself:

<b>                         RAY
</b>          I am pitching to Shoeless Joe Jackson.
          He makes a pitch. It's not a very good one, and Joe has
          to step across the plate to make contact, but his swing is
          graceful, compact and effortlessly powerful. He drives the
          ball against the fence.
          Ray watches it with wonder and when he turns back, Jackson
          is gesturing with the bat for him to make the next pitch.
          Ray makes the standard pitcher's gesture for a curve ball.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          See if you can hit my curve.
          °He goes into an elaborate windup, throws it, it does not
          curve much, and Jackson whistles it right by Ray's ear.

          Ray makes another pitch, and Jackson hits a line drive down
          the third base line. Then a smoker down the first base
          line. Ray is mightily impressed.

          here, huh?
          Joe holds the bat out low over the plate and Ray pitches
          it reasonably close to that spot. Jackson hits it out of
          the park, and beams. Ray brightens up with remembrance.

<b>                         RAY

          Ray smiles as he walks in from the mound.

          Ray and Annie look at Joe for a moment, not quite
          understanding the ground rules here. Joe senses their
          discomfort and changes the subject.

<b>                         SHOELESS JOE

</b>          There are others, you know. There were
          eight of us. It'd sure mean a lot to
          them.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          Oh man, anytime. They're all welcome
          here.
          Joe looks out over the field in eager anticipation of the
          good times to come.

<b>                         SHOELESS JOE

          Joe laughs and walks to the outfield. Annie puts her arm
          around Ray and snuggles her head against his chest.
          Nearby, brook water splashes softly in the darkness, a frog
          shrills, and fireflies dazzle the night.
          Joe is in the outfield grass now, walking toward a door cut
          into the fence.

</b>          Karin and Ray sit on the bleachers, eating peanuts while
          Shoeless Joe and his seven teammates practice. (Three,
          including Shoeless Joe, are in the outfield, two more in
          the infield, one pitches, one catches, and one bats.)
          The men are all in their twenties or thirties, but show the
          sheer enjoyment of returning after an absence of sixty-five
          years to the game they love.
          Ray directs Karin's attention to the left fielder.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          Watch Joe. Watch his feet as the
          pitcher gets the sign and starts to
          pitch. A good left fielder knows what
          pitch is coming, and he can tell from
          the.angle of the bat where the ball's
          going to be hit.
          At the sharp crack of the bat Shoeless Joe whirls, takes
          five loping strides toward the fence, turns again', reaches
          up, and the ball smacks into his glove.
          Karin cheers. One of the players good-naturedly boos.

          The players call their "good-byes" to Ray and head for the
          door in the outfield fence. Ray watches them fade out as
          they go through the door. Then he takes a moment to look
          around him.
          The baseball diamond set in the cornfield is quite
          beautiful. Ray takes a satisfied breath, and walks back
          toward his house. He is the very picture of contentment.
          Then he hears The Voice.

</b>          Ray and Annie -- along with a hundred or so other grownups
          -- are sitting in chairs too small for their grownup
          backsides. Ray is still lost in his own thoughts, doodling
          "Ease his pain" over and over again, while an Irate Mother
          has the floor, holding up a novel.

<b>                         IRATE MOTHER
</b>          .and I say smut and filth like this has
          no place in our schools!
          A large portion of the audience applauds. Annie whispers
          snarlingly to Ray:

<b>                         ANNIE
</b>          Fascist. I'd like to ease her pain.
          Ray is still lost in thought.

<b>                         PRINCIPAL
</b>          Mrs. Perkins, the book you are waving
          about is hardly smut. It is considered
          by many critics as the classic novel
          about growing up in the 1960s.

<b>                         ANNIE
</b>          (whispers to Ray)

</b>          The se-called novels of Terence Mann
          endorse promiscuity, godlessness, the
          mongrelization of races, and disrespect
          to high-ranking officers of the United
          States Army. And that's why right-
          thinking school boards all across the
           country have been banning this guy's
          shit since 1969.

<b>                         (VERY REASONABLY)
</b>          Excuse me, madam, but you're speaking
          of something about which you don't know
          squat. Terence Mann was a warm and
          gentle voice of.reason during a time of
          great madness. He coined the phrase
          'Make Love, Not War.' When others were
          chanting 'Burn, baby, burn,' he was
          writing about love, and peace, and
          understanding. He helped define an era.
          And a generation. And he helped us
          laugh at ourselves. I cherished every
          one of his books, and I dearly wish he'd
          write more. And if you had experienced
          even a little bit of the Sixties, you
          might feel the same way, too.

          the expressway there are sweaty factories, and on the
          other, old wood-frame apartment buildings with advertising
          for long-forgotten products painted on the sides. Lunatic
          drivers abound. We are not in Iowa anymore.

</b>          Ray drives slowly, looking for a store that sells Kosher
          food. But in this old newish neighborhood, there are
          dozens: butcher shops, delis, bakeries, groceries.

</b>          He lives right around here. Do you know
          him? I'm a friend of his.
          The Butcher just stares back, with suspicion.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          He's sort of a tall, black man.

          But by her raised eyebrows and the tone of her voice, it

          -- she certainly wouldn't tell him.

</b>          In between a deli and a Kosher butcher shop, Ray finds a
          storefront with blacked-out windows. He enters an open
          hallway in which he sees the door to the storefront, as
          well as stairs to the apartments above it.
          There are half-a-dozen mail boxes on the wall. Ray checks
          the names. He smiles.

</b>          Ray turns to the storefront door. Instead of a buzzer
          there is a long wire with a weight on its end hanging from
          a hole at the top of the door. Next to the wire is a
          handwritten note taped to the door, which reads: "You
          better have a goddamn good reason for ringing this bell."
          Ray laughs. This guy is great. He pulls on the wire. On
          the other side of the door, a bell rings.
          Ray has to struggle to control his nervousness. He takes
          a breath. He hears footsteps inside, approaching the door.
          He cannot help but smile with delight at the thought of
          meeting one of his cultural heroes.
          The door opens. Terence Mann is menacingly huge. He
          glares at Ray and roars:

<b>                         MANN
</b>          Who the fuck are you???-
          Ray is momentarily taken aback, but he figures maybe the
          guy is joking, so he just smiles and plunges ahead.

<b>                         RAY

          The door slams in his face. It takes Ray a few seconds to
          realize the interview is over.
          He rings the bell again. The door opens. Mann°s large
          frame fills it.

          It is hardly fashionable, but it's roomy and comfortable.
          There are tables stacked high with mailing envelopes and
          a postage scale. A few workbenches have software and
          spread sheets strewn across them. In the back are a couple
          of personal computers.
          On a side wall there are book jackets and newspaper photos
          in cheap frames: pictures of Mann with Martin Luther
          King...with Bob Dylan...with Timothy Leary...rann being

          aisle toward the field.

</b>          God, this place is so beautiful.
          The grass is so green you can almost smell it. Looking
          around the old ballpark, they see only about twenty or
          thirty die-hard fans in the stands for batting practice;
          a half-dozen players are grouped around the batting cage
          as one player hits to several others in the field. A few
          sportswriters and other civilians stand near the dugouts.
          Ray and Mann stop at the first row, right behind the Red
          Sox on-deck circle, lean on the railing and talk.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          It could be 1912 out there, for all this
          place has changed. Babe Ruth stood on
          that very mound as a pitcher long before
          anyone knew he could hit home runs.
          Same mound.

          row seats. They do not speak.
          At one point, Ray becomes suddenly and strangely aware that
          something is about to happen. He looks at Mann who is just
          watching the game. Then he looks at the scoreboard.

<b>                         94 THE SCOREBOARD 94

          pictures of the batter and pitcher, and can show instant
          replays of some of the action.

</b>          Right now, the display is replaced by an oddly glowing
          message. The sounds of the stadium, the game, and the
          crowd fade out.
          There is only the message:

          The message does not just glow, it pulsates. It looks
          almost otherworldly, phosphorescent; clearly unlike
          anything ever seen before on a ballpark scoreboard.

          from the unconcerned faces of the people near him, he
          realizes that no one else can see the message. He opens
          his program and starts writing it down. Mann notices this,
          but cannot see what Ray is writing.
          Then Ray hears The Voice.

          Mann rises and heads up the aisle. Ray looks down at the
          program -- at the handwritten legend of Moonlight Graham,
          who played one game fifty-seven years ago, but did not get
          to bat -- and follows Mann out of the ballpark.

          me 'Moonlight,' and it stuck.

          Doc fumbles out a key, and lets them in.

</b>          When you got to the majors, you played
          only one inning of one game. What
          happened in that inning?

<b>          123 INT. HIGH SCHOOL 123

          They enter the hallway of the old school, the smell of
          varnish and chalk almost palpable.

</b>          It was the last day of the season.
          Bottom of the eighth, and we were way
          ahead. I'd been up with the club for
          most of a month, but hadn't seen any
          action. Just then old John McGraw
          points a bony finger at me and says
          'Right field.' Well sir, I jumped up
          like I was sitting on a spring, grabbed
          my glove, and ran out onto the field.
          They reach a varnished door with an opaque glass inset, and
          enter. Doc Graham's office.

          Doc seats himself behind a cluttered desk, and motions Ray
          to the black-leather sofa a few feet away.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          Did you get to make a play?
          Doc takes a sheet of paper off his desk, expertly rips an
          inch or so off the corner with his teeth, and begins
          chewing.

</b>          Nope. They never hit the ball out of
          the infield.
          Ray chuckles, but then flinches as Doc shoots his little
          spitball towards him.

<b>                         DOC GRAHAM
</b>          Heads up.
          It hits the back of the sofa a few feet from Ray, and hangs
          there, like a white fly.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          I was warned about you.

<b>                         DOC GRAHAM
</b>          Anyway, one inning later the game was
          over, and so was I.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          And what was that like?

<b>                         DOC GRAHAM
</b>          It was like coming this close to your
          dreams, and then watching them brush
          past you like a stranger in a crowd.
          Ray nods, and a look of understanding begins to appear on
          his face. He looks out the window, focused on faraway.

<b>                         DOC GRAHAM
</b>          Except, at the time, you don't think
          much of it. Hardly anybody recognizes
          the most significant moment of their
          life when they're happening. Back then
          I just figured there'd be plenty more
          days. I didn't know that would be the
          only one.
          Doc Graham notices that Ray is looking very serious.

<b>                         DOC GRAHAM
</b>          Now, let me ask you a question, Ray
          Kinsella. What makes that half-inning
          so interesting that you come all the way
          from Iowa to ask me about it sixty-five

          have a wish...

          piece of paper, and bites off a little section.

<b>                         DOC GRAHAM

          grant me that wish?

</b>          I don't know. I'm just asking...
          Doc leans his left elbow on the desk and rubs his forehead
          thoughtfully with a palm, as if it were an eraser that
          could erase the years and take him back to 1929 and the
          Polo Grounds in New York.

<b>                         DOC GRAHAM
</b>          I never got to bat in the major leagues.
          I'd have liked the chance -- just once
          -- to stare down a big league pitcher.
          Stare him down and then just as he goes
          into the windup -- wink! Make him
          wonder if I know something he doesn't.
          That's what I wish for. The chance to
          squint my eyes when the sky is so blue
          it hurts to look at it, and to feel the
          'tingle that runs up your arms when you
          connect dead-on. The chance to run the
          bases, stretch a double to a triple, and
          flop race-first into third, wrapping my
          arm around the bag. That's my wish, Ray
          Kinsella... that's my wish.
          Ray begins to smile. Graham is staring intently at him.

<b>                         DOC GRAHAM

          Doc's eyes start to glisten, and he offers an embarrassed
          smile as he wipes away a tear.

</b>          I understand, but I think you're

          like this, the wind never blows so cold
          again. You feel for it like it was your
          child. I can't leave here.

          we had a big fight, I packed my things,
          said something awful, and left. After
          a while I wanted to come home, but I
          didn't know how. I made it back for the

          from escaping to the roadway.
          He eases the car to a stop in front of the house, and as

          from the back door of the house, a blur of white blouse and

          Karin beams. Ray taps Mann and points to the plate.

          Archie Graham -- now wearing a Giant's uniform -- drops one
          of the two bats he has been swinging in the on-deck circle,
          and advances on the plate, slashing the air with a
          brand-new bat the color of vanilla ice cream. He plants
          himself in the batter's b.ox, then cocks the bat, the top
          end of it trembling as if he were stirring something, and
          waits for the pitch.'
          The pitcher looks in for his signs. Archie stares back.
          As the pitcher goes into his windup, Archie winks at him.
          There is a moment of confusion and then anger on the
          pitcher's face, and when the ball speeds to the plate it
          is aimed right at Archie's head. He dives out of the way
          and hits the dirt hard. The Catcher chuckles through his
          mask.

<b>                         CATCHER
</b>          Good thing for you that wasn't his
          fastball.
          Archie digs in again at the plate, but backs up just a
          little. Now his look to the pitcher is one of
          determination.

<b>                         ARCHIE
</b>          Come on, let's see your fastball.
          The pitcher smiles, winds up and throws. Very fast. And
          right at Archie's chin. Again, he has to dive out of the
          way. This time, however, he gets right up and immediately
          appeals to the Umpire.

<b>                         ARCHIE °

<b>                         UMPIRE

          Both benches laugh at that. Archie holds up his hands to
          call time, and steps out of the batter's box. The on-deck
          batter, Mel Ott, comes over.

          Archie takes his place in the batter's box again. He still
          looks determined, but a little less cocky. The next pitch
          is a curve that looks as if it's heading right for him.
          But he holds his ground, and when the ball breaks down and
          away, he steps in, snaps the bat forward, and hits it.
          The ball sails in a high arc to right center. The center
          fielder backs up a couple of steps, lopes a few strides to
          his left, and makes the catch.
          Archie is out, but the runner on third tags up and scores.
          As Archie curls across the diamond from the first baseline
          to the Giants' bench, he hears cheering.
          In the stands, Ray, Annie, Karin and Mann are giving him
          a standing ovation. In return, he touches the brim of his
          cap, a ballplayer's cool response to adulation.

          Iowa for reasons they can't even fathom.
          They'll turn up your driveway, not
          knowing for sure why they're doing it,
          and arrive at your door, innocent as
          children, longing for the past. 'Of
          course we won't mind if you look
          around,' you'll say. 'It's only twenty
          dollars per person.' And they'll pass
          over the money without even looking at
          it. For it is money they have, and
          peace they lack.

</b>          The one constant through all the years,
          Ray, has been baseball. America has
          rolled by like an`army of steamrollers.
          It's been erased like a blackboard,
          rebuilt, and erased again. But baseball
          has marked the time. This field, this °
          game... it's a piece of our past. It
          reminds us of all that once was good.
          And that could be again. People will
          come. People will most definitely come.
          Mann has moved everyone (but Mark) with the beauty of his
          words, and the passion in his.voice. Behind him, the
          assembled ballplayers respectfully applaud.

          Ray looks at the paper with dread. He looks at Shoeless

          turns back to Mark. It's decision time.

          breathe a great sigh of relief. Mann smiles.

          Ray looks up at Mann, who, with a gentle tilt of the head,
          directs Ray's attention to the house. Ray looks behind him
          toward the house.

          down the driveway. Dozens of cars. Cars with out-of-state
          license plates.
          Some people,have gotten out of their cars and wait
          patiently. One or two families sit on their hoods, or have
          set up picnic dinners on their station wagons' tailgates.

          Ray rises threateningly, and Mark turns toward him. In so
          doing, he twists little Karin off balance.

<b>                         MARK

          In that split second, they hear a strangled gasp, and see

          at the foot of the bleacher. It takes forever for her body
          to come down with a sickening thud on the hard green boards
          of one of the bottom rows.

          Mann winces. He knows that could be fatal. Ray kneels by
          Karin. Her nose and one side of her face have been scraped
          by the fall. Blood starts to trickle from her nose, across
          her cheek and down her neck. She is becoming bluer and her
          cough is faint, as though she is in another room.

          jacket and covers Karin gently.
          Karin is getting paler, bluer, and her breathing more
          strained and distant.

          Then, without reason, Ray slowly turns toward the field.
          The White Sox stand near him by the fence, the Giants stay
          around their bench. All except one: young Archie Graham.

           his step slows. He reaches the end of the fence -- around
           which no player can pass
          -- and when he emerges from the
          shadows on the bleachers side, he is no longer young
          Moonlight Graham, the ballplayer of long ago...but Doc
          Graham, the old man from Chisholm, Minnesota. His baseball

          other under her knees, seats himself on the bleachers, and
          turns her face down. Supporting her chest with one hand,
          he delivers a series of sharp blows between her shoulder
          blades with the heel of his other hand.
          Annie honks again. Ray waves her to him. Mark cannot
          believe what he is seeing.
          Suddenly, Karin's diaphragm expands as she sucks in air.
          Doc reaches around and pries her mouth open, releasing a
          sizable piece of hog dog and bun.
          As he turns her over, we can see the blueness disappearing
          from her face as she continues to breathe deeply. Doc
          peels back each eyelid in turn, stares at the pupil for a
          few seconds, and lets the eye close.

          It just now sinking for Ray what-Doc Graham has sacrificed
          to save the child. Ray looks to the field, and then back
          at the Doctor.

          players start to gather up their equipment. Shoeless Joe

           Joe starts to trot off the field, then he stops and turns
           back to the bleachers.

<b>                         SHOELESS JOE

          Ray's jaw drops.

          Shoeless Joe and the other players wait for Mann to join
          them, ignoring Ray's question.

<b>                         167 MASTER
</b>
<b>                         167
</b>          John starts to walk off toward the door in the outfield
          fence.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          Hey!
          John turns back. Ray is holding a ball.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          You wanna have a catch?
          John closes his eyes for a second, and when he opens them;
          there is the hint of moisture. Does he know Ray is his
          son?

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          I'd like that.

          Ray tosses him the ball, picks up a glove lying there, and
          puts it on.

          They throw the ball back and forth.

          And as we pull up higher and higher we see a father and son
          bathed by white floodlights and car headlights... on the
          silent, satiny green of a baseball diamond at the edge of
          a cornfield.

<b>                         FADE OUT
</b>
<b>                         THE END
</b>
