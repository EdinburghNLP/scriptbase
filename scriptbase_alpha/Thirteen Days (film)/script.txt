     13 Days

     by

     David Self


     DARKNESS.  As the MAIN TITLES BEGIN, the theater thrums with
     a subsonic HISS which mounts in all the rattling power of
     THX, and we...

     BURN IN, BRIGHT LIVING COLOR:

     EXT. STRATOSPHERE - DAY

     The glory of stratospheric dawn.  The engines of a silver
     Lockheed U-2F rasp upon the trace oxygen here at 72,500 feet. 
     Scattered cloud formations hang over the blue brilliance of
     sea far, far below.  In the haze, the looming edge of land.

     SUPER: FLIGHT G-3101. OCTOBER 14TH, 1962. OVER CUBA.

     The spy plane's CAMERA DOORS whine open.  The glassy eye of
     the 36-inch camera focuses.  And then with a
     BANGBANGBANGBANG, its high-speed motor kicks in, shutter
     flying.

                                   MATCH CUT TO:

     INT. O'DONNELL BEDROOM - DAY

     A simple CAMERA, snapping away furiously in the hands of a
     giggling MARK O'DONNELL, 4.  He's straddling and in the face
     of his dad, KENNY O'DONNELL, 30's, tough, Boston-Irish, with
     a prodigious case of morning hair.  Kenny awakens, red-eyed.

                    HELEN (O.S.)
          Mark, get off your father!

     Kenny sits up to the morning bedlam of the O'Donnell house.

     KIDS screech, doors bang all over.  Kenny pushes Mark over,
     rolls out of bed, snatches up the corners of the blanket and
     hoists Mark over his shoulder in a screaming, kicking bundle.

     INT. O'DONNELL HALLWAY - DAY

     Kenny, with Mark in the bundle on his shoulder, meets his
     wife HELEN going the other way in the hall with LITTLE HELEN,
     1, in her arms.

                    KENNY
          Hi, hon.

     They kiss in passing.  Daughter KATHY, 12, races by in angry
     pursuit of her twin, KEVIN, 12.

                    HELEN
          Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk
          to you this afternoon about Kevin.  You
          need to do something about this.

                    KENNY
          Kids are supposed to get detention.

     Kenny dumps the bundle with Mark in a big pile of dirty
     laundry.

                                   SMASH CUT TO:

     EXT. MCCOY AIR FORCE BASE - FLORIDA - DAY

     A pair of massive FILM CANISTERS unlock and drop from the
     belly of the U-2.  TECHNICIANS secure them in orange carrying
     cases, lock them under key, fast and proficient.  They whisk
     them out from under the spy plane.

     The Technicians run for an idling Jeep.  They sling the cases
     into the rear of the vehicle which in turn accelerates away
     hard, curving across the runway for another waiting plane.

                                   SMASH CUT TO:

     INT. O'DONNELL KITCHEN - DAY

     A kitchen out of the late 1950's.  Kenny drinks coffee, ties
     a tie, rifles through a briefcase at the kitchen table.  The
     horde of kids, ages 2-14, breakfast on an array of period
     food.  Kenny grills the kids while he goes over papers.

                    KENNY
          Secretary of Defense...

                    KEVIN
          Dean Rusk!

                    KENNY
          Wrong, and you get to wax my car.

     KENNY JR. smirk at Kevin.

                    KENNY JR.
          Rusk is State, moron.  Robert McNamara.

                    HELEN
          Got time for pancakes?

                    KENNY
          Nope.  Attorney General?

     A PHONE RINGS as the kids cry out en masse.

                    KIDS
               (chorus)
          Too easy!  Bobby, Bobby Kennedy!

     Kenny glances up at the wall.  There are two phones, side by
     side.  One RED, one BLACK.  It's the black one ringing. 
     Helen answers.  Kenny goes back to his papers.

                    KENNY
          All right, wise guys, Assistant
          Secretary of State for Latin America...

                                   SMASH CUT TO:

     EXT. STEUART BUILDING - DAY

     A U.S. Navy truck lurches to a stop in front of the run-down,
     brick-faced seven-story Steuart Building on 5th and K.  Rear
     doors BANG open, and out hop two MARINE GUARDS, side arms
     drawn, film canisters in a carrying case between them.

     SUPER:  NATIONAL PHOTOGRAPHIC INTERPRETATION CENTER
     (NPIC), WASHINGTON D.C.

     As the Marines approach the building, front doors SLAM open.

     INT. OPERATIONS OFFICE, NPIC - DAY

     A bespectacled OPERATIONS MANAGER hands a clipboard to one of
     the big Marine Guards who in turn hands him a set of keys. 
     The Manager unlocks the film cases.  PHOTO INTERPRETERS swoop
     in, whisk away the contents: SPOOLS OF FILM.

                                   SMASH CUT TO:

     EXT. O'DONNELL RESIDENCE - DAY

     A black Lincoln pulls away from the modest white house on a
     tidy Washington D.C. residential street.

     EXT. WASHINGTON D.C., AERIAL - DAY

     The car threads its way through the Washington traffic, past
     the big administrative buildings, down tree-lined avenues,
     takes a turn into a gate.  As the car stops at the gate, the
     CAMERA flies past, revealing it's the gate to the WHITE
     HOUSE.

                                   SMASH CUT TO:

     INT. NPIC - DAY

     CLOSE ON the five-thousand rolls of film spewing through
     processing equipment, its streaking passage leading us
     straight through the development machinery to:

     A SERIES OF VARIOUS SHOTS:

     Photo Interpreters power up light tables, stereoscopic
     viewers, zip across the floor in wheeled chairs.

     Flying switches, flickering lights, humming motors.  It's an
     eerie dance of technological black magic.

     Another pair of Interpreters loom out of the darkness, side
     by side, ghostly looking, their glasses reflecting the glare
     of the light table, like magicians staring into a crystal
     ball.

     IMAGES FILL THE SCREEN

     Aerial shots, flashing by.  Cuban countryside from 72,500
     feet.  A MAGNIFYING GLASS swings down on its arm in front of
     us, magnifying the carpet of trees... and a row of six canvas
     covered OBJECTS among them.

                                   SMASH CUT TO:

     EXT. WHITE HOUSE - WEST WING - DAY

     Kenny, in business suit and tie, trots up the steps, and a
     MARINE GUARD snaps the door open for him.

     INT. WEST WING - CONTINUOUS

     Kenny, briefcase in hand, weaves his way through the empty,
     ornate hallways of the West Wing.  Past magnificent doorways,
     early American furniture, paintings.  He finally reaches a
     doorway, goes through into:

     INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     A long, narrow affair, window at the back looking out into
     the Rose Garden.  Kenny dumps his briefcase on the desk,
     shucks off his coat, removes a folder from his briefcase,
     turns and heads back out...

     INT. WEST WING HALLS - CONTINUOUS

     And into the warren of offices and halls that is the working
     White House.  He takes a right, passes the doors to the Oval
     Office right next to his office, goes down a long, straight
     hall, into...

     INT. MANSION - CONTINUOUS

     The formal main building, the executive mansion.  He passes
     the busts of Presidents past, turns left into an elevator. 
     The doors close.

     INT. 3RD FLOOR - FAMILY QUARTERS - DAY

     The doors open.  Kenny strides out onto a DIFFERENT FLOOR,
     the third.  He heads down the long, posh hall of the family
     quarters.  Fine furnishings, art.  The living White House.

     He approaches the double doors at the end of the hall guarded
     by a cluster of SECRET SERVICE AGENTS.  An agent opens one of
     the doors.

                    KENNY
          Morning, Floyd.

                    SECRET SERVICE AGENT
          Good morning, Mr. O'Donnell.

     INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Kenny enters the elegant bedroom.  The figure alone at a side
     table by the window, drinks coffee, breakfast still spread
     out before him, Washington Post obscuring his face.

                    KENNY
          Top o' the morning, Mr. President.

     The figure lowers the paper.

     It is PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY.  He's wearing boxers and a
     tank top.  Unshaven.  Bed-head.

     Kenny O'Donnell, former ward-pol and long-time Kennedy man,
     is his Chief of Staff...

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Morning, Kenny.  You see this goddamn
          Capehart stuff?

     The President rattles the paper.  Kenny collapses in the
     chair opposite the President, sprawls, comfortable.

                    KENNY
          Bayh's going to lose, but it's good
          groundwork for us for '64.

     Kenny steals a piece of buttered toast off the President's
     plate.  The President spares him a glance.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          I was eating that.

                    KENNY
          No you weren't.

                    THE PRESIDENT
               (scanning the paper)
          I was, you bastard.

     Kenny takes a defiant bite.

                    THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
          So what've we got today?

                    KENNY
          Today, for your information, is Pulaski
          Day.  We're going to Buffalo...

                                   SMASH CUT TO:

     INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

     SUPERIMPOSE: BUFFALO, NEW YORK

     A luxury hotel crowded with LOCAL POLS: the Democratic
     machine of Buffalo.  Beyond the open floor-to-ceiling
     windows, a CROWD.  The Pulaski Day Parade, a glimpse of '69s
     Americana.  High School bands blare Sousa.  The scene is
     deafening, boisterous.  Pols trail Kenny as he crosses the
     room: fast, tough, on-the-go.

                    POL #1
          We're putting up Potowski next time. 
          Will you guys come out for him?  

                    KENNY
          Who else you got?

                    POL #2
          There's Richardson.  Good kid.

                    KENNY
          Got the touch?

                    POL #2
          Yeah.  Still moldable, too.

                    KENNY
          Everyone likes a good kid...

     And like that, a congressional candidate is made...  Kenny
     accelerates, leaving the Pols behind.  Suddenly, outside the
     windows, the crowd swells forward with a collective ROAR.

                    CROWD
          MR. PRESIDENT!  PRESIDENT KENNEDY!

     EXT. HOTEL - DAY

     Kenny heads down the steps with New York Times Washington
     Bureau Chief, SCOTTY RESTON. Anonymous, they weave their way
     through the crowd for a police car on a side street.

                    RESTON
          How's my favorite President?

                    KENNY
          Busy.  But you've got his heart.

                    RESTON
          I want an hour with him.

                    KENNY
          I said his heart, not his attention.

                    RESTON
          Three weeks before midterm elections? 
          You need me.

                    KENNY
          Well.  There is a new civil rights
          initiative he wants to talk about.

                    RESTON
          I'm doing a piece on Skybolt.  I hear
          Macmillan's meeting with him in Nassau.

     Kenny just sighs as they make their way up to the police car. 
     A Secret Service Agent opens the door for him, another is
     behind the wheel.

                    KENNY
          We're giving the Brits Polaris instead. 
          But a story'll just aggravate things.

     Scotty stares at Kenny, determined.  Kenny looks away.  And
     his eye catches a tall, willowy BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.  She is
     talking, excited, embarrassed, to two more SECRET SERVICE
     AGENTS.  What they're saying is lost in the noise.

     Scotty follows Kenny's gaze.  Then the two men share a look,
     a silent understanding.  Kenny glances at the Secret Service
     guy holding the car door, tilts his head at the woman.

                    KENNY (CONT'D)
          Not today.  He's got tight schedule.

     The Agent nods, heads for the other Agents and the Beautiful
     Woman.  Scotty acts like nothing has happened.

                    RESTON
          Pretending there isn't a problem won't
          fix it.  He can clear the air on Anglo
          American relations.

                    KENNY
          Forget it, Scotty.

                    RESTON
          Let him talk to me, he makes Macmillan
          look good, I print it, the British
          public likes it, Macmillan owes you.

     The formula's exactly what Kenny wants to hear.  He pretends
     to consider, pretends to cave as he gets in the car.

                    KENNY
          All right, you're in.  Half hour.

     Reston's won.  But so has Kenny, and he's made Scotty feel
     tough in the bargain.  People like Kenny.

     INT. POLICE CAR - DAY

     In the back seat, Kenny stares out the window at the parade
     goers.  The Secret Service Agents leave the Woman. 
     Disappointed, the Woman turns and vanishes into the crowd. 
     It's an eerie moment.  Something troubles Kenny, and he
     glances up at the sky.  A premonition.  But it's a clear,
     clear blue.  A day like this, all is right with the world...

                                   SMASH CUT TO:

     INT. NPIC - NIGHT

     Six Interpreters huddle around IMAGES on a light table.  One
     of them shoulders his way into the group and THUMPS a black
     BINDER on the table.  There are grim nods of agreement.

     The book is open to a PICTURE of an SS-4 BALLISTIC MISSILE. 
     A photo from Moscow Mayday parade.  An icon of the nuclear
     age escorted like some devil-god to a holocaust...

     END MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE

     EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY

     The White House casts long shadows this gorgeous October
     morning.  Blue sky; the first flash of color in the trees.

     SUPER: TUESDAY, OCTOBER 16TH, 1962.  DAY 1.

     INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     Briefcase and coat in hand, Kenny enters his office - and
     finds THREE MEN.  Standing there.  Thin-haired, bespectacled,
     academic-looking MCGEORGE BUNDY, 43, the National Security
     Advisor.  The two men in the background: PHOTO INTERPRETERS.

     Kenny hangs up his coat, sees the Interpreters' large black
     display cases.  And suddenly the world is slightly off
     kilter.

                    KENNY
          Hey, Mac.  You're up bright and early.

                    BUNDY
          No, Ken.  I need to see him now...

     INT. WHITE HOUSE - RESIDENTIAL FLOOR - DAY

     Kenny emerges from the elevator with Bundy.  They head down
     the long, posh 3rd floor hall, the Presidential Detail
     guarding the doors at the end.  But the familiar route feels
     strange, and lasting an eternity.  Kenny eyes the package
     under Bundy's arm, its TOP SECRET stamp visible.

                    KENNY
          Morning, Floyd.

                    SECRET SERVICE AGENT
          Good morning, Mr. O'Donnell.  Mr. Bundy.

     The Agent opens the door.  Bundy pauses, Kenny with him.

                    KENNY
          What's it about?

                    BUNDY
          Cuba.

     Bundy is tense.  But Kenny relaxes.

                    KENNY
          Just Cuba?  Okay, I got work to do, see
          you guys downstairs.

     INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     Kenny's office is a raging beehive of activity.  Kenny works
     the phone as ASSISTANTS come and go with files.

                    KENNY
               (to phone, scary calm)
          Listen to me, you worthless piece of
          disloyal shit.  You will pull Daly's man
          on the circuit.  You owe your goddamn
          job to this administration.
               (beat, listening)
          There is a word you need to learn.  It
          is the only word in politics.  Loyalty. 
          LOYALTY you motherfucking piece of shit!

     As Kenny THROWS the phone down at the receiver, and the
     PRIVATE DOOR to the Oval Office suddenly opens.  Kenny
     glances up.  President Kennedy stands there in the doorway. 
     Kenny thinks he's reacting to the tirade.

                    KENNY (CONT'D)
          What're you looking at?  This isn't the
          blessed order of St. Mary the Meek.

     Kenny stops.

                    KENNY (CONT'D)
          Excuse us.

     The Assistants leave, shutting the door after them.  Kenny
     rises.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          I think you should come in here.

     Kenny starts for the door.

                    THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
          Still think Cuba isn't important?

                    KENNY
          Not as far as the election goes.

     The President lets Kenny by into...

     INT. OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     WE ENTER from a different angle than we usually enter in
     movies: through the side door.  The President's ornate desk
     sits on the right, windows looking out on the Rose Garden
     behind it.  Kenny's gaze swivels to:

     THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM where the Interpreters, their
     crewcut chief, ARTHUR LUNDAHL, 50's, and Bundy stare at him. 
     They're surrounded by PRESENTATION BOARDS propped up around
     the fireplace.  The President's rocking chair and sofas.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          You used to look down a bomb sight for a
          living, Ken.  What do you see?

     In eerie silence, as all eyes follow him, Kenny makes his way
     among the presentation boards with the U-2 imagery, stops in
     front of the picture of the six canvas-covered objects.  It
     unleashes a wave of memories.

                    KENNY
          We hit a Nazi buzz bomb field in '45. 
               (beat, incredulous)
          It looks like a rocket base...

     He puts his hand out to touch the image, then turns and looks
     to the President, knowing what they must be.

                    BUNDY
          On Sunday morning, one of our U-2s took
          these pictures.  The Soviets are putting
          medium range ballistic missiles into
          Cuba.

     Shock.  Silence.  Kenny glances to the other men.

                    LUNDAHL
          They appear to be the SS-4: range of a
          thousand miles, three-megaton nuclear
          warhead.

                    KENNY
          Jesus Christ in Heaven...

     INT. WHITE HOUSE OPERATOR'S CENTER - DAY

     A bank of WHITE HOUSE OPERATORS work the switchboard, fingers
     flying, voices overlapping in a babble of:

                    VARIOUS OPERATORS
          Please hold for the White House...Mr.
          O'Donnell for Secretary McNamara...
          White House Operator... please hold...

     INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY

     Kenny carries the phone with him as he paces hard from his
     desk to his window.

                    KENNY
          The principals are assembling in an
          hour.  See you then.

     Kenny hangs up.  The President enters.  A beat.  And in that
     beat, there's a void.  The two men are off their emotional
     stride, trying to grope their way out of shock.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Where's Bobby?

     Kenny nods, acknowledging the feeling

                    KENNY
          Should be here any minute.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Good.

     And we glimpse the chemistry of these guys by Bobby's
     absence.  It's like they're missing their third wheel.

                    THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
          Good.

                    BOBBY (O.S.)
          Where the hell are you?

     The President and Kenny hear him out in the hall.  And the
     tension goes out of them instantly.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          In here!

     They turn to the door as BOBBY KENNEDY, 37, the President's
     younger brother/Attorney General, enters.  Bobby shuts the
     door behind him, falls into Kenny's chair, and clearly
     grappling with his own disbelief, is hushed.

                    BOBBY
          Jesus Christ, guys.  What the hell's
          Khruschev thinking?

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Did you have any indication of this from
          Georgi?  Any possible warning or sense
          of motivation?

                    BOBBY
               (shaking his head)
          Complete snowjob.  And then we went out
          and told the country they weren't
          putting missiles into Cuba.
               (beat)
          By the way, you realize we just lost the
          midterms.

                    KENNY
          Who gives a shit about the midterms now? 
          The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons
          ninety miles away from us.

                    BOBBY
          You mean there's something more
          important than votes?  Didn't think I'd
          live to see the day, Ken.

     The President paces away, grim.

                    KENNY
          Jesus.  I feel like we've caught the Jap
          carriers steaming for Pearl Harbor.

     INT. WEST WING HALLWAY - DAY

     The President strides down the plush hallway, Bobby and Kenny
     flanking him.  Unconsciously, all three men assume the same
     gait: confident, powerful, no longer disoriented.

     And before our eyes, the three men's game faces appear, and
     they become the hard-ass leaders of the United States. 
     Secret Service Agents throw open the massive double doors to
     the Cabinet Room.

     INT. CABINET ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     And they enter.  The group of men at the long, ornate
     Roosevelt-era table, rise as one.

                    GROUP
          Good morning, Mr. President.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Good morning, gentlemen.

     And the doors close on the eighteen men of EXCOM: The
     Executive Committee of the National Security Council.  They
     are the legendary "Best and Brightest."

     The President makes his way down the line: shakes hands with
     Secretary of State DEAN RUSK, 53, distinguished, with a soft,
     Georgian accent, a distant reserve.

                    THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
          Dean, good morning.

                    RUSK
          Mr. President.

     The President leans past him, grasps the hand of the
     Secretary of Defense ROBERT MCNAMARA, 46, a gifted managerial
     genius... the price of which is a cold, hard personality.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Bob.  Bet you had a late night.

                    MCNAMARA
          Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.

     OFF TO THE SIDE, Kenny greets Vice President LYNDON JOHNSON,
     54, and ADLAI STEVENSON, 62, Representative to the U.N.,
     intellectual, well-spoken.

                    KENNY
          Lyndon.  Adlai.

     The silver-haired war hero and politically savvy Chairman of
     The Joint Chiefs of Staff, GENERAL MAXWELL TAYLOR, 50s,
     shakes the President's hand.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Max.

                    GENERAL TAYLOR
          McCone's been notified and is coming
          back from the West coast.  Carter's
          here, though.

     He gestures to GENERAL MARSHALL CARTER, Deputy Chief of
     Operations for the CIA.  Carter nods to the President.

     THE CAMERA PANS OVER THE OTHERS.

     DOUGLAS DILLON, ex-banker, Secretary of the Treasury.

     ROSWELL GILPATRIC, studious Deputy Secretary of Defense.

     PAUL NITZE, 55, the detail-driven facts man, Assistant
     Secretary of Defense.

     GEORGE BALL, 50s, Undersecretary of State.  Eloquent, a man
     of conscience.

     U. ALEXIS JOHNSON, Deputy Under Secretary of State.

     EDWARD MARTIN, Assistant Secretary of State for Latin
     America.

     LLEWELLYN THOMPSON, laid back, rumpled Soviet Affairs
     Advisor.

     DON WILSON, Deputy Director of the USIA.

     The President sits down at the center of the table, Rusk and
     McNamara to either side, and the others resume their seats. 
     Bobby takes one of the over-stuffed chairs at the table.

     Kenny finds one along the wall behind the President, under
     the windows to the Rose Garden to TED SORENSEN, 30s, the
     President's legal counsel and speech writer.  They greet each
     other coolly.

                    KENNY
          Ted.

                    SORENSEN
          Kenny.

     The room falls silent.  The President looks across the table
     to GENERAL CARTER.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Okay.  Let's have it.

                    GENERAL CARTER
          Arthur Lundahl heads our photographic
          interpretation division at CIA.  I'll
          let him and his boys take you through
          what we've got.  Arthur?

     Lundahl, standing at the end of the room with briefing
     boards, steps forward with a pointer.

                    LUNDAHL
          Gentlemen, as most of you now know a U-2
          over Cuba on Sunday morning took a
          series of disturbing photographs.

     SWINGING THE POINTER AT A BOARD SMASH CUTS US TO:

     EXT. MISSILE SITE - LOS PALACIOS, CUBA - DAY

     The sweltering Cuban countryside.  Shouting SOVIET ROCKET
     TROOPS, stripped to the waist, glistening with sweat, machete
     a clearing under scattered, limp palm trees.

                    LUNDAHL (V.O.)
          Our analysis at NPIC indicates the
          Soviet Union has followed its
          conventional weapons build-up in Cuba
          with the introduction of surface-to
          surface medium-range ballistic missiles,
          or MRBMs.  Our official estimate at this
          time is that this missile system is the
          SS-4 Sandal.  We do not believe these
          missiles are as yet operational.

     A bulldozer TEARS through the undergrowth.  FILLING THE
     SCREEN.  A 70-foot long MISSILE TRANSPORTER creeps along in
     the bulldozer's wake like a vast hearse with its shrouded
     cargo.

     INT. CABINET ROOM - DAY

     Lundahl raps his second board: a map of the United States,
     Cuba visible in the lower corner.  An ARC is drawn clearly
     across the U.S., encompassing the entire Southeast.

                    LUNDAHL
          IRONBARK reports the SS-4 can deliver a
          3-megaton nuclear weapon 1000 miles.  So
          far we have identified 32 missiles
          served by around 3400 men, undoubtedly
          all Soviet personnel.  Our cities and
          military installations in the Southeast,
          as far north as Washington, are in range
          of these weapons, and in the event of a
          launch, would only have five minutes of
          warning.

                    GENERAL CARTER
          Five minutes, gentlemen.  Five minutes.

                    GENERAL TAYLOR
          In those five minutes they could kill 80
          million Americans and destroy a
          significant number of our bomber bases,
          degrading our retaliatory options.  The
          Joint Chiefs' consensus is that this is
          a massively destabilizing move,
          upsetting the nuclear balance.

     The President stares at Lundahl, and beating out each word.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Arthur.  Are. You. Sure?

     Lundahl looks around the room.  Everyone is hanging.

                    LUNDAHL
          Yes, Mr. President.  These are nuclear
          missiles.

     The men come to grips with their own fears, own anger.

                    BOBBY
          How long until they're operational?

                    LUNDAHL
          General Taylor can answer that question
          better than I can.

     General Taylor drops a memo on the table WHICH BECOMES:

     EXT. FIELD TABLE - MISSILE SITE, CUBA - DAY

     SCHEMATICS slapped down on a camp table.  A group of Soviet
     site ENGINEERS point and gesture as they study their ground
     from a shaded hillock.  CLEARING CREWS and SURVEYORS work and
     sweat in the distance.

                    GENERAL TAYLOR (V.O.)
          GMAIC estimates ten to fourteen days. 
          However, a crash program to ready the
          missiles could cut that time.



     INT. CABINET ROOM - DAY

     Taylor sees the grim looks all around.

                    GENERAL TAYLOR
          I have to stress that there may be more
          missiles that we don't know about.  We
          need more U-2 coverage.

     Kenny lets out his breath.  He catches Bobby's eye.  This is
     unbelievable.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Is there any indication - anything at
          all - that suggests they intend to use
          these missiles in some sort of first
          strike?

                    GENERAL CARTER
          Not at present, sir.  But I think the
          prudent answer is we don't know.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Do we have any sort of intelligence from
          CIA on what Khruschev is thinking?

                    GENERAL CARTER
          No, Mr. President.  We don't.  We just
          don't know what's happening inside the
          Kremlin at that level.

                    BOBBY
          They lied to us.  Two weeks ago Dobrynin
          told me to my face Khurschev had no
          intention of putting missiles into Cuba. 
          They said themselves, this is our
          backyard.

     There's angry agreement.  The President cuts it off.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Gentlemen, I want first reactions. 
          Assuming for a moment Khruschev has not
          gone off the deep end and intends to
          start World War Three, what are we
          looking at?

     Rusk glances to his team at the end of the table.  Ball,
     Johnson, Martin, Thompson and Stevenson.

                    RUSK
          Mr. President, I believe my team is in
          agreement.  If we permit the
          introduction of nuclear missiles to a
          Soviet satellite nation in our
          hemisphere, the diplomatic consequences
          will be too terrible to contemplate. 
          The Russians are trying to show the
          world they can do whatever they want,
          wherever they want, and we're powerless
          to stop them.  If they succeed...

                    BOBBY
          It will be Munich all over again.

                    RUSK
          Appeasement only makes the aggressor
          more aggressive.  Confidence in our
          security commitments around the world
          will falter, allies will become unsure
          in the face of Soviet pressure, and the
          Soviets will be emboldened to push us
          even harder.  We must remove the
          missiles one way or another.  It seems
          to me the options are either to build up
          the crisis 'til they give in, or we hit
          them.  An air strike.

     There's silence at the table.  Some nods.  Understanding.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Bob?

                    MCNAMARA
          We've worked up several military
          scenarios.  Before I ask General Taylor
          to lead us through the various options,
          I'd like for us to adopt a rule. 
          If we are going to strike, we must agree
          now that we will do it before the
          missiles become operational.  Because
          once they are, I don't think we can
          guarantee getting them all before at
          least some are launched.

     And there it is.  The clock is running.

                    BUNDY
          Sir.  We need to consider... if we
          decide to act, there's a good chance
          we'll end up in a general war.

     The room falls silent.  The President leans back in his
     chair, studying the circle of men around the table, weighing
     them.

     Kenny and the others watch him in silence.  A long, dramatic
     pause.  A course that will change history is about to be
     chosen.  The President leans forward, folds his hands on the
     table.  Fated.  Grave.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          It's clear we cannot permit Soviet
          nuclear missiles in Cuba.  We must get
          those missiles out.

     EXT. THE ROSE GARDEN - DAY

     Kenny and Bobby follow the President down a path through the
     Rose Garden.  The shock of the morning has worn off.  The
     President stops, looks at them.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          I don't think it's going to matter what
          Khruschev's intentions are.  I tell you,
          right now... I don't see any way around
          hitting them.

     A long moment of silence as they move along again.

                    KENNY
          If we hit 'em, kill a lot of Russians,
          they'll move against Berlin.  They
          attack Berlin, that's NATO... and we're
          at war.

     The guys stop again.  The autumn day is bright, warm, alive. 
     The air, the distant city sounds derail the relentless train
     of logic for a beat.  And in their faces we see that all
     three men, for the first time, feel the enormity of war, its
     shadow over everything.  It's only a couple of steps away. 
     Steps that they're seriously contemplating.

                    BOBBY
          Damned if we do, but if we don't, we're
          in a war for sure somewhere else in six
          months.

     Pained, the President turns away.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          No choice.  This is going to cost lives
          any way we go.  Do nothing, and it could
          be 80 million  of ours.  We have to get
          rid of those missiles.

                    KENNY
          There've got to be alternatives to just
          going out and bombing them.

                    BOBBY
          He's right, Jack.  Taylor is saying we
          may have some time.  We've got to use
          it.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          So if there are alternatives that make
          sense - and I'm not saying there are -
          we need 'em.  Need 'em fast.

                    BOBBY
          What about the allies?  Congress?  I
          think we may need to start letting key
          people know.  And they're all scattered
          across the country for the campaign. 
          We're going to need to get the U.N.
          staff in and warmed up.  Jesus... I
          don't even know if we've got secure
          communications with half our embassies
          since that the Soviets got that
          cryptographer of ours.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          We can't worry about everything right
          now.  We've got to figure out what we're
          going to do before we worry about how we
          do it.

                    KENNY
          The other thing is...

                    BOBBY
          ... I know.  CIA and the military fucked
          us on the Bay of Pigs.

                    KENNY
          They're going to be pressing for a
          military solution soon.  We can't afford
          to let them ram their agenda down our
          throats.  We need to come with options
          other than air strikes so we have some
          sort of choice here.

                    BOBBY
          We got a bunch of smart guys.  We lock
          'em up together in there, kick 'em in
          the ass til they come up with options.

     Kenny and the President look at him.  Bobby nods.

                    BOBBY (CONT'D)
          I'll do it.

                    KENNY
               (to the President)
          It's too politicized with you in there,
          anyway.  They need to be able to stick
          their necks out.

                    BOBBY
          It'll be the principals, a couple of the
          key guys from each department: the
          Executive Committee of the National
          Security Council.  We'll call it EXCOM.

     Kenny snorts a laugh.  Bobby shoots him a cross look.

                    KENNY
          EXCOM.  Has a ring to it.  Like F-Troop.

     The President stops.  Bobby and Kenny stop, too.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Okay.  Kenny and I only show for the
          meetings you call us into.  Impress us. 
          And do it fast.
               (to Kenny)
          You're in charge of keeping this quiet. 
          If word gets out before we know what
          we're going to do, there'll be panic. 
          And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if
          we decide to hit them.

                    KENNY
          Then we need to do a few things right
          away.  No Pierre.  He knows, the press
          knows. 
          You're going to have to keep up your
          schedule - your movements are followed
          too closely.  And we need to get these
          guys out of the White House.  George
          Ball's got a conference room at State.
               (to Bobby)
          Reconvene over there this afternoon,
          come back here tonight.

     Bobby nods.

                    BOBBY
          I think we should bring in Dean Acheson. 
          He was fighting Soviets while we were
          still working the wards in Boston.

     The President nods his approval.  Looks at Kenny.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Find him, Kenny.  We're going to need
          all the help we can get.

     INT. WEST WING - HALL OUTSIDE PRESS OFFICE - DAY

     Kenny moves hard and fast through the twisting warren of
     hallways and tiny offices which is the West Wing.  Suddenly,
     Scotty Reston pops out of a doorway behind Kenny.

                    RESTON
          Hey, Kenny!  Who died?

     Kenny glances over his shoulder at Scotty who points to a
     window.  A beat, then Kenny returns to look out the window. 
     Outside, the West Wing Drive is FILLED WITH LIMOUSINES.

     A flash of dismay, but Kenny covers fast.

                    KENNY
          Way it's going, the Democratic Party. 
          DNC strategy session.  If you can call
          it that.

     Scotty chuckles.  Kenny moves off, leading him away.  Kenny's
     assistant runs up behind him, holding out a slip of paper.

                    ASSISTANT
          Sir?

     Kenny tries to look him away.

                    RESTON
          It's Tuesday.  You said to call.  When
          do I get my 45 minutes?

                    KENNY
          Tell you what.  We're in Connecticut
          tomorrow for Ribicoff.  I'll get you up
          front with him during the flight.

                    RESTON
          Deal.

                    ASSISTANT
          Sir.

     Kenny turns, harsh

                    KENNY
          What is it?

     The Assistant eyes Scotty, holds his tongue.  Kenny takes the
     slips.

                    ASSISTANT
          The number you asked for.

                    KENNY
          I ask for a lot of 'em.  Whose is it?

                    ASSISTANT
          Dean Acheson's, sir.

     That shuts Kenny up.  Reston eyes the slip, then looks to
     Kenny's face.  And he knows something isn't right here.

                    KENNY
          Gotta go, Scotty.  See you tomorrow.

     INT. TREASURY BUILDING GARAGE - NIGHT

     A car jolts to a stop.  The CAMERA PANS up over the sagging
     suspension, the government plates, the hood ornament
     revealing half of EXCOM inside.  Kenny stands nearby waiting
     for them.

     The doors open, and out they pile like a bunch of clowns:
     Bobby, McNamara, Rusk, Ball, Martin, Dioptric, Sorensen,
     Stevenson, and Nitze.  They're sitting in each others' laps,
     banging their heads on the roof, joking, but tense.

                    BOBBY
          Screw secrecy.  You try having that fat
          ass sit on your lap all the way from
          Foggy Bottom.

                    MCNAMARA
          You were excited.  I say no more.

     The gang falls in behind Kenny, trails him out of the garage.

     INT. TUNNEL TO WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

     A steel door unlocks, swings open, and Kenny marches at the
     head of the wedge of men into a long tunnel.  It's the
     infamous old passage from the Treasury to the White House. 
     Kenny and Bobby get a little ahead of the others.

                    BOBBY
          Everybody agrees the diplomatic route is
          out.  It's too slow, and they'll have
          the missiles finished.

     Kenny looks at him.  Then there's only one alternative.  The
     CAMERA wipes through the ceiling to:

     EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

     GROUND LEVEL.  Where the brilliantly-lit flag flutters over
     the spotlit White House: their destination.

     INT. CABINET ROOM - NIGHT

     GENERAL WALTER 'CAM' SWEENEY, head of Tactical Air Command,
     stands at the head of the table with a presentation board. 
     The men of EXCOM gather around Sweeney in their rumpled
     shirts, nursing coffee and cigarettes.

                    GENERAL SWEENEY
          We have 850 planes assembling at
          Homestead, Eglin, Opa Locka, MacDill,
          Patrick, Pensacola and Key West.

                                   SMASH CUT TO:

     EXT. HOMESTEAD AFB - FLORIDA - NIGHT

     An F-100 Super Sabre stands under lights on a taxiway.  The
     CAMERA DESCENDS FROM ITS OVERHEAD SHOT, discovering the
     aircraft's sleek cockpit, menacing tiger-jaw paint job, the
     four 20mm cannons on its nose.

                    GENERAL SWEENEY (V.O.)
          Due to the tropical foliage, the OPLAN
          calls for high-explosive and napalm
          loadouts for our ground attack sorties.

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

     The FLIGHT LINE where a full strike wing stands beyond this
     plane, pylons laden with weapons, GROUND CREW servicing them.

     INT. CABINET ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Other EXCOM members draw near the board, its order of battle,
     strike maps.  They're grim, but fascinated.  Empowering. 
     Intoxicating.  Sexy.  Kenny sees it in the faces, even the
     President's.  Adlai does too, is upset.

                    ADLAI
          I still think there are diplomatic
          approaches we haven't considered yet.

     Kenny looks at Adlai.  The others around the room,
     embarrassed, don't respond.  The group has moved on and
     Stevenson hasn't.

                    GENERAL TAYLOR
          We have high confidence in the expanded
          air strike option.
               (beat)
          The problem, Mr. President, is that it's
          a short-term solution.  Khruschev can
          send more missiles next month.  The
          Chiefs and I believe we should follow up
          the air strikes with the full version of
          OPLAN 316.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          An invasion...

                    GENERAL TAYLOR
          Yes, sir.  We can be sure we get all the
          missiles, and we remove Castro so this
          can never happen again.

     Kenny looks around the room at the men, the murmurs of
     general agreement, senses the consensus building and is
     agitated.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?

                    GENERAL TAYLOR
          Yes, sir.  Our best option is to
          commence the strikes before the missiles
          are operational.  The invasion happens
          eight days later.

     The President leans back in his chair, turns to the man at
     the far end of the table: DEAN ACHESON, 60s, former Secretary
     of State.  He sits silent, like some revered oracle, the
     architect of the American Cold War strategy of containment.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Dean.  What do you think?

     Acheson arches an eyebrow, and when he speaks, his voice
     resonates throughout the room, powerful, smooth, hypnotic.

                    ACHESON
          Mr. President, you have rightly
          dismissed the diplomatic option.  The
          Soviet will only tie you down in
          negotiation, and leave us short of our
          goal, the removal of the missiles. 
          Negotiating will do nothing more than
          give them time to make the missiles
          operational, complicating the necessary
          military task we have at hand.

     Everyone in the room listens to him with rapt attention, his
     presence overshadowing the room, oracular:

                    ACHESON (CONT'D)
          For the last fifteen years, I have
          fought here at this table along side
          your predecessors in the struggle
          against the Soviet.  Gentlemen, I do not
          wish to seem melodramatic, but I do wish
          to impress upon you one observation with
          all conceivable sincerity.  A lesson I
          have learned with bitter tears and great
          sacrifice.
               (beat)
          The Soviet understands only one
          language: action.  It respects only one
          word: force.

     Kenny stares at the old man.  Acheson's gaze finds his
     through the cigarette smoke.  Acheson's eyes travel to the
     President.

                    ACHESON (CONT'D)
          I concur with General Taylor.  I
          recommend, sir, air strikes followed by
          invasion, perhaps preceded by an
          ultimatum to dismantle the missiles if
          military necessity permits.

     Taylor nods, vindicated.  The others murmur their approval. 
     Bobby, at the table in front of Kenny and to his left, trades
     a dire look with Kenny.  This is happening too fast.  Bobby
     holds his head, looks about at the others, deeply distressed.

     The President sinks back in his chair, staring at Acheson.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Then it appears we have three options. 
          Number one.  A surgical air strike
          against the missiles themselves.  Two, a
          larger air strike against their air
          defenses along with the missiles.

     Kenny eyes Bobby.  Bobby is writing something.

                    THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
          And three, invasion.

     Bobby looks over his shoulder at Kenny, and REACHES BACK to
     him with a folded NOTE.  Kenny takes it, opens it.

     It reads NOW I KNOW WHO TOJO FELT PLANNING PEARL HARBOR.

                    THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
          We're certainly going to do number one;
          we're going to take out these missiles,
          so it seems to me we don't have to wait
          very long.  We ought to at least be
          making those preparations.

     Kenny gives Bobby a curt nod.  Bobby tilts his head at the
     President: pass the note on to him.  Kenny rises, slips the
     note in front of the President.

     The President unfolds the note, and we HOLD ON IT and his
     reaction as in the b.g., out of focus, Taylor speaks:

                    GENERAL TAYLOR
          Yes, sir, we're preparing to implement
          all three options, though I must stress
          again, sir, there are risks to the
          strikes without the follow-on invasion.

     Bundy clears his throat.  Speaks from somewhere down the
     table.

                    BUNDY
          You want to be clear, Mr. President,
          that we have definitely decided against
          a political track.

     The President folds the note away, glances at Bobby.  A beat,
     the President looks from Bobby to Acheson.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Dean, how does this play out?

                    ACHESON
          Your first step, sir, will be to demand
          that the Soviet withdraw the missiles
          within 12 to 24 hours.  They will
          refuse.  When they do, you will order
          the strikes, followed by the invasion. 
          They will resist, but will be overrun. 
          They will retaliate against a target
          somewhere else in the world, most likely
          Berlin.  We will honor our treaty
          commitments and resist them there,
          defeating them per our plans.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Those plans call for the use of nuclear
          weapons.
               (beat)
          And what is the next step?

     Acheson sits back in his chair, smooths his moustache.  A
     dramatic beat, and then his ominous pronouncement rings out:

                    ACHESON
          Hopefully cooler heads will prevail
          before we reach the next step.

     A chill runs down Kenny's spine.  He looks in shock to the
     President.  The President remains calm.  But in place of the
     fated look the President has had, there's a hesitation.

     INT. WEST WING HALLS - NIGHT

     Acheson strides down the hall, Taylor, Sweeney, Carter and
     Bundy swept along behind him.  Bundy is on the defensive, the
     others grim.

                    GENERAL TAYLOR
          If McNamara'd get off the fence...

                    BUNDY
          We have time.

                    GENERAL CARTER
          Goddamn it, it's obvious.  It's the only
          option.  That asshole, Stevenson.  We
          can't let this drag out or we lose our
          shot.

                    BUNDY
          Bombing them...

                    ACHESON
          Remember that the Kennedys' father was
          one of the architects of Munich.  The
          General is right.  There is only one
          responsible choice here.

     Bundy just nods.  Taylor grabs a door ahead for Acheson.

                    ACHESON (CONT'D)
          Let's pray appeasement doesn't run in
          families.  I fear weakness does.

     And the men head into a stairwell going down.

     INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

     Grimacing in pain.  He opens a pill bottle, takes two pills
     out.  He takes a whiskey in a shot glass from Kenny.

     RESUME

     Kenny finishes pouring him and Bobby a couple of more shots,
     discreetly turning a blind eye to the President's pain.

     The President returns from his desk, shirt untucked,
     disheveled, back stiff.  He eases into his rocking chair. 
     Bobby lies sprawled on the couch.  Kenny sits down.  They all
     look at each other.  A beat, something like shock.

                    KENNY
          Jesus Christ Almighty...

     They burst out laughing.  An absurd, tension draining moment. 
     They shoot their drinks, Kenny refills.

                    KENNY (CONT'D)
          Call me Irish, but I don't believe in
          cooler heads prevailing.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Acheson's scenario is unacceptable.  And
          he has more experience than anyone.

                    KENNY
          There is no expert on this subject, no
          wise old man.

     The President stares Kenny in the face, understanding.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          The thing is, Acheson's right.  Talk
          alone won't accomplish anything.

     Kenny considers the President, his face straight as he says:

                    KENNY
          Then let's bomb the shit out of them.
          Everyone wants to, even you, even me.
               (there's a point)
          It sure would feel good.

     The President sees what Kenny's saying: it'd be an emotional
     response, not necessarily the intelligent one.

                    BOBBY
          Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but
          a sneak attack is just wrong.

                    KENNY
          He's right.  And things are happening
          too fast.  It smells like the Bay of
          Pigs all over again.

     Bobby picks up some reconnaissance photos on the coffee
     table.

                    BOBBY
          As if dealing with the Russians wasn't
          hard enough, we gotta worry about our
          own house.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Tonight, listening to Taylor and
          Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles
          telling me all I had to do was sign on
          the dotted line.  The invasion would
          succeed.  Castro would be gone.  Just
          like that.  Easy.

     The President is rendered mute by a wave of pain.  Kenny and
     Bobby aver their eyes.  When it passes, the President is
     hushed, grave.

                    THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
          There's something...immoral about
          abandoning your own judgement.

     Kenny nods, moved.  The President reaches out for the
     reconnaissance photos Bobby's flipping through.  Bobby hands
     them to him.  The President looks them over.  And when he
     speaks, there's humility.  And resolve.

                    THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
          We can't let things get ahead of
          themselves.  We've got to control what
          happens. 
          We're going to do what we have to make
          this come out right.  EXCOM is our first
          weapon.
               (beat)
          We'll resort to others as we need 'em.

     EXT. AIRPORT - BRIDGEPOINT, CONNECTICUT - DAY

     SUPER: WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 17TH.  DAY 2

     A LONG SHOT of an ENORMOUS CROWD thronging a bunting-trimmed
     platform.  The President, barely recognizable at the
     distance, and a cluster of political VIPS wave from it,
     smiling.

     Kenny steps INTO FRAME, back here at the fringes of the
     crowd.

                    THE PRESIDENT (O.S.)
          Doesn't anybody in Connecticut have to
          work today?

     The crowd goes nuts.  Kenny paces, checks his watch,
     impatient to be done with the necessary diversion.  Kenny
     gazes off to his right and spots Scotty Reston, along with
     half the White House press corps suckered along.  Scotty
     catches Kenny's look.

     Kenny turns away, but Scotty comes weaving over.  The
     President continues on, but all we hear is Scotty and Kenny.

                    RESTON
          Kenny!  What happened?  They didn't let
          me up front, said the President was on
          the phone the whole time.

                    KENNY
          He was.

                    RESTON
          Yeah?  Who was he talking to?  Acheson? 
          Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering
          what's going on.  What's Acheson doing
          in town?  And don't give me some
          bullshit about DNC think tanks. 
          Acheson's Mr. Cold War.

                    KENNY
          Why don't you ask him yourself?  You can
          have him on the way home.

                    RESTON
          I'm giving you a chance here: talk to
          me.  You can influence how this thing
          unfolds.

     But Kenny stands there, mute.  Reston just shakes his head,
     knowing for sure something's up.  He turns and heads back for
     the press corps.

          EXT. STAIRS TO AIR FORCE ONE - DAY

     Kenny and the President climb the stairs to the Presidential
     plane, the crowd cheering him.  He gives a final wave.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Let's get out of here.

                    KENNY
          Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire
          White House Press Corps for a day.

     INT. GEORGE BALL'S CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

     EXCOM meets in George Ball's small conference room at the
     State Department.  Bobby, in shirtsleeves, paces at the head
     of the table, very, very alone.  All eyes are on him.

                    BOBBY
          No.  No.  No.  There is more than one
          option here.  If one isn't occurring to
          us, it's because we haven't thought hard
          enough.

     McNamara squirms.  The others react in frustration.  CIA
     chief JOHN MCCONE, sharp, tough, conservative, is harsh.

                    MCCONE
          Sometimes there is only one right
          choice, and you thank God when it's
          clear.

                    BOBBY
          You're talking about a sneak attack! 
          How'll that make us look?  Big country
          blasting a little one into the stone
          age.  We'll be real favorites around the
          world.

                    ACHESON
          Bobby, that's naive.  This is the real
          world, you know that better than
          anybody.  Your argument is ridiculous.

                    MCCONE
          You weren't so ethically particular when
          we were talking about options for
          removing Castro over at CIA.

     And there's nothing Bobby can say to that.  He props himself
     up on the table, stares at it as if there's an answer in its
     shiny surface somewhere.  There is only the reflection of his
     own face.

                    BOBBY
          I can't let my brother go down in
          History like a villain, like a Tojo,
          ordering another Pearl Harbor.

     McCone, Acheson, and Taylor share a look.  The last
     resistance to airstrikes is crumbling.  Finally, Bobby looks
     up at McNamara.

                    BOBBY (CONT'D)
          Bob.  If we go ahead with these air
          strikes...
               (beat)
          There's got to be something else.  Give
          it to me.  I don't care how crazy,
          inadequate or stupid it sounds.  
               (beat, pleading)
          Give it to me.

     McNamara suffers under the gaze of everyone at the table,
     weighing the situation out.  And finally he ventures.

                    MCNAMARA
          Six months ago we gamed out a scenario. 
          It's slow.  It doesn't get rid of the
          missiles.  There are a lot of drawbacks.
               (beat)
          The scenario was for a blockade of Cuba.

     SUPER: THURSDAY, OCTOBER 18TH.  DAY 3

     INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY

     Kenny enters the office from his side door in the middle of a
     debate.  Military uniforms dominate the room: General Taylor,
     General Sweeney, and a host of briefing officers.

                    GENERAL TAYLOR
          The situation is worse than we thought. 
          We count 40 missiles now, longer range
          IRBMs.  They can hit every city in the
          continental U.S.

     The President stares out the window at the Rose Garden, his
     back to Air Force Chief of Staff GENERAL CURTIS LEMAY, 60. 
     Beetle-browed, arrogant, the archetypal Cold War general. 
     Yet there is something about him, his intelligence perhaps,
     that suggests he's playing a role he knows and believes in.

     The only other civilians in the room are Bobby, Bundy and
     McNamara.  The pressure from the military is almost physical.

                    LEMAY
          Mr. President, as of this moment my
          planes are ready to carry out the air
          strikes.  All you have to do is give me
          the word, sir, and my boys will get
          those Red bastards.

     The President continues staring out the window.  Kenny eases
     over to the desk, leans on it, arms folded, interposing
     himself between the President and the soldiers.  Bobby joins
     him, side-by-side.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          How long until the army is ready?

                    GENERAL TAYLOR
          We've just begun the mobilization under
          cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. 
          We're looking at another week and a
          half, Mr. President.

                    LEMAY
          But you can begin the strikes, now.  The
          plans call for an eight-day air
          campaign.  It'd light a fire under the
          army's ass to get in place.

     That makes the President turn around, stare at LeMay.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          General LeMay, do you truly believe
          that's our best course of action?

                    LEMAY
          Mr. President, I believe it is the only
          course of action.  American is in
          danger.  Those missiles are a threat to
          our bomber bases and the safety of our
          nuclear deterrent.  Without our
          deterrent, there's nothing to keep the
          enemy from choosing general nuclear war. 
          It's our duty, our responsibility to the
          American people to take out those
          missiles and return stability to the
          strategic situation.  The Big Red Dog is
          digging in our back yard, and we're
          justified in shooting him.

     Taylor steps in softly, smoothly: good cop to LeMay's bad.

                    GENERAL TAYLOR
          Sir, we have a rapidly closing window of
          opportunity where we can prevent those
          missiles from ever becoming operational. 
          The other options...

     He spares a look at McNamara, who watches the fireworks, arms
     folded, serious.

                    GENERAL TAYLOR (CONT'D)
          ...do not guarantee the end result we
          can guarantee.  However, the more time
          that goes by, the less reliable the
          choice we can offer you becomes.

     The President, partially defused, looks from Taylor to
     McNamara.  LeMay steps forward, softer now, sincere.

                    LEMAY
          Mr. President, the motto I chose for SAC
          is 'Peace is our Profession.'  God
          forbid we find ourselves in a nuclear
          exchange.  But if launched, those
          missiles in Cuba would kill a lot of
          Americans.  That's why I'm being such a
          pain in the ass about destroying them. 
          Destroying them immediately.  Hell, even
          Mac agrees.

     Bundy is uncomfortable.  Everyone turns to him.  He nods. 
     Kenny realizes he's been co-opted by the military.  McNamara
     does too, lets out a deep breath.  The President eyes Bundy,
     then paces out from behind his desk, walks up to LeMay.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          General, what will the Soviets do when
          we attack?

                    LEMAY
          Nothing.

     Kenny, Bobby and the President look at each other, unable to
     believe what they just heard.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Nothing?

                    LEMAY
          Nothing.  Because the only alternative
          open to them is one they can't choose.

     His pronouncement hangs there in the air: ominous, dangerous.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Those aren't just missiles we'll be
          destroying.  We kill Soviet soldiers,
          and they will respond.  How would we
          respond if they killed ours?  No, they
          will do something, General, I promise
          you that.  And I believe it'll be
          Berlin.

     INT. WEST WING HALLWAY - DAY

     LeMay walk out of the Oval Office with Taylor, Carter and
     their staffers.

                    LEMAY
          Those goddamn Kennedys are going to
          destroy this country if we don't do
          something about this.

     There are dark looks on the faces of the other officers. 
     They agree.

     INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY

     As the meeting next door disperses, the President rummages
     through Kenny's jacket which hangs on Kenny's chair.  Kenny,
     bemused, holds out the package of cigarettes the President is
     looking for.

                    KENNY
          I was hoping LeMay pushed you.  I
          wouldn't mind going a few rounds with
          him.

     The President glances up, takes the proffered smokes.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          We knew it was coming.  I tell you,
          Kenny, these brass hats have one big
          advantage.  We do what they want us to,
          none of us will be alive to tell 'em
          they were wrong.

     Bobby, Rusk and Sorensen enter from the hall.

                    SORENSEN
          Mr. President, Gromyko should be on his
          way by now.

                    RUSK
          We need to go over what you're going to
          say.

                    BOBBY
          There's still no sign they know that we
          know about the missiles.  Been a lot of
          cloud cover; probably think we aren't
          getting any good product.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          We keep 'em in the dark as long as we
          can.  But I sure as hell am going to
          test him.

     INT. WEST WING HALL - DAY

     Kenny comes out of the bathroom, and is buttonholed by the
     crewcut, bullet-headed Press Secretary, PIERRE SALINGER, in
     the crowded, busy hallway.

                    SALINGER
          Kenny, I'm getting funny questions from
          the guys in the press office.  As Press
          Secretary, I need to know.  What's going
          on?

     Kenny wheels back into his office.  It's filled with people. 
     But he bends confidentially to Pierre's ear.

                    KENNY
          They're planning to shave you bald next
          time you fall asleep on the bus.
               (off Pierre's get-serious look)
          Sorry, Pierre, Gromyko just arrived.

     INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY

     The Press Corps throngs Kenny's tiny office, pushing and
     shoving for a vantage at the side door to the Oval Office,
     waiting for the Gromyko photo-op.  Kenny stands shoulder-to
     shoulder with Reston and Sorensen near the door.

                    RESTON
          Are they going to discuss the military
          exercises going on in Florida?

     Kenny doesn't even blink, but Sorensen does a poorer job at
     hiding his reaction.

                    KENNY
          Come on, Scotty.  This meeting's been on
          the books for months.  It's just a
          friendly talk on U.S.-Soviet relations.

     Fortunately, the conversation is cut short as a dozen
     FLASHBULBS suddenly go off on a dozen cameras as the
     reporters crush in on the Oval Office, and Reston is swept
     forward.

     KENNY'S POV:

     over the reporters.  The President, unsmiling, enters the
     room beside Soviet Foreign Minister, ANDREI GROMYKO.  Gromyko
     pauses for the photos: grim, dark haired, saturnine.

     RESUME

     Kenny reacts.  At last, the face of the enemy.

     INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

     The CAMERA picks up the darkened windows: the meeting has
     gone long.  The CAMERA MOVES PAST Kenny and Sorensen standing
     in the doorway to Kenny's office, FINDS the President in his
     chair across from Gromyko on the sofa.  Rusk, Ambassador
     ANATOLY DOBRINYN, and two INTERPRETERS around them.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          So that there should be no
          misunderstanding, the position of the
          United States, which has been made clear
          by the Attorney General to Ambassador
          Dobrynin here, I shall read a sentence
          from my own statement to the press dated
          September 13th.
               (beat, reading)
          Should missiles or offensive weapons be
          placed in Cuba, it would present the
          gravest threat to U.S. national
          security.

     The President stares at Gromyko as the translator finishes
     translating.  Gromyko sits there, enigmatic, cold,
     unreadable.  The translator finishes, and Gromyko stops him
     with a gesture so he can answer in his own accented English.

                    GROMYKO
          Mr. President, this will never be done. 
          You need not be concerned.

     The President hides his fury masterfully, and gazing over his
     glasses, asks:

                    THE PRESIDENT
          So I do not misunderstand you: there are
          no offensive weapons in Cuba.

     A beat.  And Gromyko's response is flat, sure, steady:

                    GROMYKO
          No, Mr. President.  We have sent
          defensive weapons only to Cuba.

     Kenny's blazing eyes could drill holes in the back of
     Gromyko's head.  His gaze swings to the PRESIDENT'S DESK.

     BENEATH THE DESK sit the BRIEFING BOARDS with the evidence.

     INT. WEST WING HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Kenny emerges from his office.  The Soviet delegation
     disappears down the hallway with Rusk.  Kenny turns as Bobby,
     haggard, comes up from the other direction.

     Bobby gestures to the vanishing delegation, now being
     HARANGUED OC by the press.

                    BOBBY
          What happened?

     The President comes out of the next door down the hall, the
     Oval Office.  He turns and sees Kenny and Bobby.  He's livid.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Lying bastard.  Lied to my face.

                    BOBBY
          We're split down the middle.  If I held
          a vote I think airstrike would beat
          blockade by a vote or two.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          I want a consensus, Bobby.  Consensus. 
          Either air strike or blockade. 
          Something everyone'll stand by even if
          they don't like it.  I need it by
          Saturday.  Make it happen.

                    BOBBY
          What if I can't?

                    KENNY
          We go into this split, the Russians will
          know it.  And they'll use it against us.

     The prospect disturbs the three men.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Have you cancelled Chicago and the rest
          of the weekend yet?

                    KENNY
          You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll
          know there's something going on.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          I don't care.  Cancel it.

                    KENNY
          No way.

     The President spins on him, unsure he heard correctly.

                    KENNY (CONT'D)
          I'm not calling and cancelling on Daly. 
          You call and cancel on Daly.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          You're scared to cancel on Daly.

                    KENNY
          Damn right I'm scared.

     The President pauses, looks at Bobby.  Bobby shakes his head:
     don't look at me.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Well, I'm not.

                    BOBBY
          Then you'll call, right?

     INT. HALLWAY - SHERATON-BLACKSTONE HOTEL - NIGHT

     SUPER: FRIDAY, OCTOBER 19TH.  DAY 4

     THEN SUPER: CHICAGO

     Kenny threads his way through the host of SECRET SERVICE
     AGENTS and ADVANCE MAN cramming the hallway on the floor of
     the hotel they've taken over.  From one of the rooms emerges
     Salinger.

                    SALINGER
          Kenny, all right.  What's going on here? 
          There's rumors going around an exercise
          in the southeast is related to Cuba. 
          I'm the Press Secretary.  I can't do my
          job if I don't know what's going on.  So
          what's going on?

                    KENNY
          What are you telling them?

                    SALINGER
          The truth: I don't know.

                    KENNY
               (deadly serious)
          Tell 'em you've looked into it, and all
          it is is an exercise.  And Pierre --
               (beat, loaded)
          The President may have a cold tomorrow.

     Kenny stares at him, and the light dawns on Pierre. 
     Something big is going on and he's been cut out of it.  He
     stalks off.

                    SALINGER
          Damn it, Kenny.  Goddamn it!

     INT. RECEPTION HALL - SHERATON-BLACKSTONE - NIGHT

     A big 100-dollar-a-plate dinner is in full swing to a dinner
     band's tunes.  The President and Chicago MAYOR RICHARD DALY
     make the rounds among the fund raising CROWD.  Kenny follows
     them at a respectful distance, greeting old cronies.

     Suddenly a MESSENGER hustles over to Kenny, hands him a note. 
     Kenny makes eye contact with the President, nods and leaves.

     INT. HOTEL ELEVATORS - NIGHT

     Kenny waits at the elevator.  Scotty saunters up behind him. 
     He sizes Kenny up, clears his throat.  Kenny turns around.

                    RESTON
          There are major rail disruptions in the
          South, two airborne divisions are on
          alert.  That exercise is an invasion.

                    KENNY
          Well, you know how Bobby has it in for
          the State of Mississippi.

                    RESTON
          This is about Cuba.

     Kenny freezes, then explodes.

                    KENNY
          Cuba?  You're fucking crazy.  We are not
          invading Cuba.  Nobody gives a rat's ass
          about Cuba.  Not now, not ever. 
          If you print something like that, all
          you're going to do is inflame the
          situation.  Nobody talks to assholes who
          inflame situations.  Assholes like that
          can find themselves cut out of the loop.

     Reston is taken aback.  Stung silence for a beat.  Kenny's
     response is far louder than any "yes."  Now Kenny realizes
     it.

                    RESTON
          You've never threatened me before.

     And Kenny looks away, upset, but when he turns back to
     Reston, all that's there is his poker face.  The elevator
     arrives.

                    RESTON (CONT'D)
          All right.  I'm not going to print
          anything until I have another source. 
          But I promise you, I'll get one.

     Kenny boards the elevator.  The doors shut on Scotty.

     INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

     Kenny closes his eyes, sags against the wall, hating himself.

     INT. KENNY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Kenny enters his hotel room.  An Assistant waits with the
     phone, hands it straight to Kenny.

                    KENNY
               (to Assistant)
          Tell Pierre I need to talk to him.
               (to phone)
          Bobby?

     INT. OUTER ROOM - GEORGE BALL'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     EXCOM files past Bobby out of George Ball's conference room.

                    BOBBY
          Bring him back.

     EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SHERATON-BLACKSTONE HOTEL - DAY

     SUPER: SATURDAY, OCTOBER 20TH.  DAY 5

     The President emerges from the hotel, a HAT on his head.  The
     Press and a CROWD surge forward, crying out for the
     President's attention.  Kenny slides into the limo first as
     the President waves to the crowd.

     Salinger waits on the sidewalk, and after the limo pulls
     away, the Press pushes in on him.  Pierre's face is pale -
     he's just been told everything.

                    SALINGER
          The President has a cold.  He is
          cancelling the remainder of this trip
          and is returning to Washington on the
          advice of his doctor.

     INT. WHITE HOUSE MANSION - OVAL ROOM - DAY

     The White House Oval ROOM: opulent, filled with priceless art
     and furniture, but cramped.  EXCOM members crowd around the
     center coffee table and the President.  Kenny stands behind
     him with Bobby.  Rusk rises from his seat, formal.

                    RUSK
          Mr. President, our deliberations have
          led us to the conclusion that, for the
          moment, a blockade of offensive weapons
          to Cuba is our best option.  But we'll
          still need a strong showing of support
          from the Organization of American States
          to give us an umbrella of legitimacy.

     At long last... Kenny looks at Bobby, relieved.  They've
     bought time to find a settlement.  Bobby smiles a small
     smile: what were you so worried about?

                    MCNAMARA
          A blockade is technically an act of war,
          therefore we recommend calling the
          action a quarantine.

     McNamara folder in hand, opens it, SMASH CUTTING US TO:

          800 miles out, the navy will stop them,
          board, and any vessels containing
          weapons will be turned back.

     its stern distaff, FILLING THE SCREEN, WIPING TO:

     INT. WHITE HOUSE MANSION - OVAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     The President.  He listens, looks over the briefing papers as
     McNamara continues.  Everyone watches the President.

                    MCNAMARA
          A quarantine prevents more missiles from
          reaching Cuba, but it doesn't remove the
          ones already there.  It gives the
          Soviets a chance to pull back without
          war.  If they refuse to remove the
          missiles before they're operational, we
          retain the option to strike or invade.

                    BOBBY
          We believe that a surprise attack would
          be counter to what the United States
          stands for.  We believe that an attack
          leaves us no room for maneuver, and the
          inevitable Soviet response will force us
          into a war we do not want.  A war that,
          this time, will really end all war.

                    MCCONE
          Mr. President, there are still those of
          us who believe we should proceed with
          the strikes.  With the blockade, we lose
          strategic surprise and we run the risk
          of a first strike if the Soviets decide
          they have to use the missiles or lose
          them.

     The President gazes from one expectant face to another.  But
     he himself remains unreadable.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Quarantine or air strike.

     Adlai clears his throat.  Everyone looks over at him.  He
     stares down at his clasped hands for a beat.  He's anguished
     about what he's going to say.

                    ADLAI
          There is a third option.  With either
          course we undertake the risk of nuclear
          war.  It seems to me maybe one of us in
          here should be a coward.

     He smiles weakly, but gets no response from anyone.

                    ADLAI (CONT'D)
          So I guess I'll be.  Our third choice is
          to cut a deal.  We trade Guantanamo and
          our missiles in Turkey, get them to pull
          their missiles out.  We employ a back
          channel, attribute the idea to U Thant. 
          U Thant then raises it at the U.N.

     Adlai looks for support around the room, but meets only stony
     gazes.  From McCone and General Taylor, contempt.  Dead
     silence for a long, long beat.

     Kenny's heart goes out to Stevenson as he watches the man
     commit political suicide.  Even Sorensen, standing behind
     him, unconsciously moves away.  At last the President speaks.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          I don't think that's possible, Adlai.
               (beat, to the room)
          I will be asking the networks for air
          time Monday night.  I have not yet made
          my final decision.  We will announce our
          course of action then.  I want to thank
          you all for your advice, gentlemen.

     EXT. TRUMAN BALCONY - DAY

     Kenny, Bobby, and the President lean on the railing of the
     Truman Balcony, stare out at the city.

                    BOBBY
          Goddman Stevenson.  Jesus.  Peace at any
          price.  You'd think nobody learned
          anything from World War Two.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Somebody had to say it.  I respect Adlai
          for having the guts to risk looking like
          an appeaser.

                    BOBBY
          We have to pull him.  He's not going to
          be able to handle the Soviets in front
          of the U.N.  Zorin will eat him alive.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          We've got bigger problems right now.

                    KENNY
          We have to try the blockades.  It
          probably won't work.  It may just be
          delaying the inevitable.  But we can't
          just go to war without trying not to.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          I don't know.  I don't know.

     He stares out at the Ellipse where a little-league football
     game sweeps across the grass, the shouts and screams of the
     CHILDREN, so alive, floating to them on the wind.

     EXT. PATIO - JIM ROWE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     A crowded D.C. party spills out of Jim Rowe's house onto his
     patio.  Kenny steps INTO FRAME.  He looks at the PARTYGOERS,
     the Washington social set.  He stands out, oppressed by the
     knowledge he's unable to share.  He takes a stiff drink.

     Suddenly out of the house totters Adlai, highball in hand. 
     Glassy-eyed, he grins at Kenny and joins him.

                    ADLAI
          Just can't get away from you guys. 
          Escaping for a night on the town, eh?

                    KENNY
          As the town's most popular playboy, the
          President felt my presence would be
          sorely missed.  So in the interests of
          National Security...

     Kenny shrugs.  Adlai takes a long drink, closes his eyes.

                    ADLAI
          Gotta keep up appearances.  Of course, I
          don't care anymore.  I'm a political
          dead man.  You ever seen a man cut his
          own throat like I did today?

     Kenny has no answer to that.  He looks down, pained for
     Adlai.

                    ADLAI (CONT'D)
          Well, it's all right.
               (beat)
          I came to tell you, just talked to a
          friend.  Reston and Frankel have the
          story.  It's going to run tomorrow.

     INT. BEDROOM - JIM ROWE'S HOUSE - LATER

     Kenny, shut in the bedroom, paces on the phone.

                    KENNY
          We're not going to make it to Monday. 
          I'll try to lean on Reston, but you're
          going to have to call Orville Dryfoos. 
          This is the sort of decision the
          publisher makes himself.

          INT. ORVILLE DRYFOOS' KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     New York Times publisher ORVILLE DRYFOOS sits at his kitchen
     table in his underwear, still half-asleep, phone to his ear.

                    DRYFOOS
          Yes, sir, I understand.  But we held on
          Bay of Pigs and it was the biggest
          mistake of my life.  What makes this any
          different?

     INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

     The President, on the phone, stops pacing by his bedside
     table and exhales.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          I'm asking you to hold the story until I
          can present our course of action on
          Monday night.

     INT. ORVILLE DRYFOOS' KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

                    DRYFOOS
          All right.  But I need a reason to give
          my boys.  They're going to be screaming
          for my head on a plate.

     INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Orville.  I want you to tell them this:
          they'll be saving lives.  Maybe even
          including their own.

     INT. ORVILLE DRYFOOS' KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     At that, Dryfoos sits up.  Serious.  All resistance gone.

                    DRYFOOS
          Yes, Mr. President.

     INT. ST. STEPHEN'S CHURCH - DAY

     SUPER: SUNDAY, OCTOBER 21ST.  DAY 6

     AVE MARIA soars over the communion meditation at a crowded
     Sunday mass.  Kenny, in a pew, glances off to his left.

     The President sits nearby, head bowed.  But Kenny knows he's
     not thinking about the mass.  And when the President at last
     lifts his head, Kenny sees the calm poise.

     The President has made up his mind...

     INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY

     Bobby barges into Kenny's office.  Kenny, knowing his unique
     entry, doesn't bother to look up.

                    KENNY
          Acheson called, DeGaulle's with us;
          haven't heard from anyone else yet.

     Kenny finally looks up.  Bobby's grim.  And an icicle forms
     in Kenny's gut as Bobby relays.

                    BOBBY
          He wants to talk to LeMay again.

     INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY

     Kenny, Bobby, McNamara, Rusk, Bundy and half of EXCOM stand
     to the side of the room.  General Sweeney and LeMay stand in
     front of the President's desk.

     The President, bowed in the window, is care-worn, a thousand
     years old.  The shadow, the composition of the SHOT tells us
     all.  It's down to what's in the heart of one man.  Kenny is
     deeply moved at his friend's Gethsemane.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Cam, can you guarantee me you'll get all
          the missiles?

     Sweeney glances at LeMay.  LeMay's stern, frozen look wills
     him to say, very simply, "yes."

     But then the President turns around, looks Sweeney in the
     eye.  It would make Machiavelli himself tell the truth.

                    GENERAL SWEENEY
          Sir, I can guarantee we'll get all the
          missiles we know about.

     The President holds Sweeney in his gaze.  Thank you.

                    LEMAY
          Mr. President, we can get better than
          ninety percent of them.

     The President doesn't respond to LeMay's last-ditch appeal. 
     Ninety-percent isn't good enough with nuclear weapons.  He
     moves to his desk, signs a paper, hands it to General
     Sweeney.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          As of seven o'clock Monday night, all
          United States armed forces world wide
          will stand up to DEFCON 3.

     EXT. BARKSDALE AFB - SUNSET

     SUPER: MONDAY, OCTOBER 22ND.  DAY 7

     A DEAFENING WHINE.  And INTO FRAME yawns the enormous
     spinning mouth of a B-52 bomber jet engine.  It closes on us,
     sucking us in like a maelstrom, but at the last second the
     CAMERA SLIPSTREAMS OVER IT --

     -- carrying us over the aircraft's wing.  The CAMERA pivots
     and the vast war machine crawls away underneath joining --

     -- a long LINE of identical behemoths, in single file inching
     down a taxi way which vanishes into the distance.  As the
     plane's immense vertical tail WIPES OUR VIEW:

     EXT. MISSILE SILO - NIGHT

     The CAMERA races toward a spotlighted concrete emplacement,
     over the immense BLAST DOOR which is sliding open, and DOWN --

     INT. MISSILE SILO - CONTINUOUS

     -- into the depths of a missile silo.  The CAMERA speeds down
     the side of the Titan missile, through CLOUDS of steaming
     liquid hydrogen, past FUELING HOSES which clamp one by one to
     the rocket's side, past GANTRY ARMS pulling away.  The CAMERA
     hurtles all the way to the bottom, SMASHING THROUGH THE FLOOR
     TO:

     EXT. CARRIBEAN SEA - NIGHT

     The dark ocean, whitecaps whipping luminous around the
     aircraft carrier, U.S.S. ESSEX and her escorts.  Running
     lights flash red and green.

     The carrier's SIREN begins a lonely, eerie WOOP WOOP WOOP
     WOOP like some immense creature which has lost its mind.  The
     ship FILLS THE SCREEN, CUTTING US INTO:

     INT. WEST WING - CONTINUOUS

     The doors to the Cabinet room.  A beat.  Then they SWING
     WIDE.  The President emerges, livid fury on his face, leaving
     chaos behind: the Congressional briefing.  Kenny comes out a
     beat later, catches up with him.

                    KENNY
          You'd worry that something was wrong if
          Congress offered you unconditional
          support.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          They want this fucking job, they can
          have it.  It's no great joy to me.

     The President exhales, getting control.

                    THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
          The elected representatives of the
          people have spoken...
               (beat; determined)
          Now let's tell the people...

     INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

     Kenny stands there in the doorway, arms folded.  As we PULL
     AWAY FROM HIM, we REVEAL the three NETWORK T.V. CAMERAS
     staring straight at us.  Their red lights go on as one, and
     we swing around REVERSING TO:

     The President at his desk: telegenic, powerful.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Good evening, my fellow citizens.  This
          Government, as promised, has maintained
          the closest surveillance of the Soviet
          military build-up on the island of
          Cuba...

     EXT. BARKSDALE AFB - NIGHT

     The first B-52 trundles to a stop at the end of the runway. 
     It begins to throttle-up, the ROAR of its engine mounting...

                    THE PRESIDENT (V.O.)
          ...unmistakable evidence has now
          established the fact that a series of
          missile sites is in preparation on that
          imprisoned island.  The purpose of these
          bases can be none other than to proved a
          nuclear strike capability against the
          Western Hemisphere...

     -- AND DROWNING OUT the President's speech as the plane
     lurches forward, down the runway into the night.

     EXT. MISSILE SILO - NIGHT

     The Titan solo door GRINDS OPEN.  And the missile inside
     begins to rise into the white bath of the crossed spotlights.

                    THE PRESIDENT (V.O.)
          Therefore, in the defense of our own
          security and under the authority of the
          Constitution, I have directed that the
          following initial steps be taken. 
          First, to halt this offensive build-up,
          a strict quarantine --

     EXT. CARRIBEAN SEA - NIGHT

     The President's words conjure the ESSEX battlegroup, its
     destroyers plunging through heavy seas, lit up in the night.

                    THE PRESIDENT (V.O.)
          -- on all offensive military equipment
          under shipment to Cuba is being
          initiated.  All ships of any kind bound
          for Cuba, if found to contain cargoes of
          offensive weapons, will be turned back. 
          Second: I have directed the continued
          and increased close surveillance of Cuba
          and its military build-up.  Should these
          offensive military preparations
          continue, further action will be
          justified --

     EXT. OVER THE FLORIDA STRAITS - NIGHT

     A flight of F-4 PHANTOMS drops INTO FRAME, lights flashing.

                    THE PRESIDENT (V.O.)
          -- I have directed the Armed Forces to
          prepare for any eventualities.

     INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

     A beat.  And the President looks up from his notes.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          And third: it shall be the policy of
          this nation to regard any nuclear
          missile launched from Cuba against any
          nation in the Western Hemisphere as an
          attack by the Soviet Union on the United
          States, requiring a full retaliatory
          response upon the Soviet Union...

     The chilling words hang there in the air.  BLEEDING IN: the
     rising and falling WOOP WOOP WOOP WOOP which becomes --

     EXT. CARRIBEAN SEA - NIGHT

     -- the voice of the Essex battlegroup: sparkling, alive, a
     constellation of lights scattered across the sea.  One by one
     the escort ships answer the carrier's SIREN with their own
     wailing cries, an alien chorus among the ships, disappearing
     and reappearing in the swells.  The communication crescendos
     to its fever pitch --

     -- and then the battlegroup goes to blackout.  Like a dying
     universe, the answering sirens cut off, the life-lights wink
     out, and an appalling darkness falls across the sea...

     FADE OUT

     BLACKNESS, LIKE BEFORE A CURTAIN RISES.  And then a
     flickering: a FLUORESCENT LIGHT COMES ON.

     INT. BATHROOM - WEST WING - DAY

     SUPER: TUESDAY, OCTOBER 23RD.  DAY 8

     Kenny, stripped to the waist, Sorensen and Bundy shave in
     nearby sinks.  Bobby barges in.

                    BOBBY
          We're getting the Soviet response.

     INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

     Specks of shaving cream still on his face, Kenny paces, reads
     the inky carbon as Bobby, Bundy and Sorensen read copies.

                    KENNY
          This is all rhetoric.
               (realizing)
          They don't know how to respond yet.

     Kenny looks up.  The President enters from the Oval Office.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          So now you're Khurschev.  What do you
          do?

     INT. CABINET ROOM - DAY

     Kenny, arms folded, stands behind the President, the rest of
     EXCOM is looking at him.

                    KENNY
          -- run the blockade.  They'll run the
          blockade.

     ADMIRAL GEORGE ANDERSON, 50s, dapper, the Chief of Naval
     Operations, nods from the far end of the table.

                    ADMIRAL ANDERSON
          Which is exactly what they appear to be
          preparing to do, Mr. President.  We're
          tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. 
          There's no sign they're changing course. 
          The closest ships, the Gagarin and the
          Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line
          by this time tomorrow.

                    MCNAMARA
          We're concerned about the possibility of
          an incident with an innocent cargo
          carrier.  If it turns ugly, the Russians
          could use an ugly incident and bad world
          opinion as leverage to force us to
          remove the quarantine.

                    MCCONE
          Or they could use it as an excuse to
          escalate.

                    BOBBY
          Admiral Anderson, if the ships do not
          stop, what exactly are our rules of
          engagement?

     Anderson signals A BRIEFING OFFICER who hits the lights and
     an overhead projector which SMASH CUTS TO:

     INT. BRIDGE - U.S.S. JOHN R. PIERCE - DAY

     The bridge of the U.S.S. John Pierce, a Gearing class
     destroyer.  A RADIO OPERATOR addresses a mike in Russian.

                    ADMIRAL ANDERSON (V.O.)
          Russian-speakers have been transferred
          to all of our ships.  Once the
          quarantine takes effect in the morning,
          our ships will attempt to make radio
          contact with the approaching vessels. 
          They will be ordered to reduce speed and
          prepare for inspection.

     INT. WEAPONS' LOCKER - U.S.S. PIERCE - DAY

     MARINES in flak jackets grab M-16s off a rack, race by.

     EXT. U.S.S. PIERCE - AFT DECK - DAY

     A ship's boat full of Marines lowers away, hits the water,
     engine spraying as it launches forward - in dress rehearsal.

                    ADMIRAL ANDERSON (V.O.)
          An inspection party will then board and
          search the ship.  If weapons are found,
          the ship will be ordered to leave the
          quarantine area or be towed into port
          upon refusal.

     INT. CABINET ROOM - DAY

     All eyes are on Admiral Anderson's overhead projections. 
     Bobby, restless, gets up, begins pacing.

                    BOBBY
          What happens if the ship doesn't stop
          for inspection or want to be towed?

                    ADMIRAL ANDERSON
          A warning shot will be fired across its
          bow.

     Bobby stops, stares directly at the Admiral.

                    BOBBY
          And what happens if the ship ignores the
          warning shot?

                    ADMIRAL ANDERSON
          Then we fire at its rudder, disable it,
          and carry out the inspection.

     Kenny looks at the President who remains unmoved, unreadable.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          There will be no shooting without my
          explicit orders.  Is that understood?

                    ADMIRAL ANDERSON
          Yes, sir.

     The President glances at McNamara.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Well, Admiral, it looks like it's up to
          the Navy.

                    ADMIRAL ANDERSON
          The Navy won't let you down, sir.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          General, have we developed any more
          information on the missiles?

                    GENERAL TAYLOR
          They are continuing to proceed with the
          development.  We're commencing low-level
          photography runs this morning.

                    MCCONE
          The pictures will be used to firm up our
          estimates of the missiles' readiness and
          develop target packages for strikes
          should you order them.

                    GENERAL TAYLOR
          Our guy running this show is the best. 
          Commander Bill Ecker of the Navy's VFP
          62, the Fightin' Photo.  Something of a
          character, but the highest efficiency
          ratings we've ever had.

     He pushes Ecker's personnel file across the table, and as the
     President opens it, on ECKER'S PHOTO, we SMASH CUT TO:

     INT. READY ROOM - KEY WEST NAVAL AIR STATION - DAY

     The man himself, COMMANDER BILL ECKER, 30s, playing cards,
     smoking cigars with his wingman, LIEUTENANT BRUCE WILHEMY and
     the PILOTS of VFP-62, the 'Fightin' Photo.'  They lounge,
     tinker with equipment.  Their ready room is filled with pin
     ups, movie posters, and all things photographic.

                    ECKER
          75 millimeter, I'm listening.  On the
          big screen there's nothing like it.

     The other pilots heckle him, but are muted by Taylor.

                    GENERAL TAYLOR (V.O.)
          To protect our pilots, we're prepared to
          retaliate against any SAM site or anti
          aircraft battery that opens fire.

                    WILHEMY
          Watch out, Hollywood.  There's a new
          epic director in town!

     INT. CABINET ROOM - DAY

     EXCOM listens in sober silence.

                    GENERAL TAYLOR
          We have a flight of Thunderchiefs able
          to respond within minutes of an attack
          on our planes.

     Kenny catches the President's eye.  Kenny glances at the
     door.  Step outside, I need to talk to you.

     INT. OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     The President and Kenny stand in front of the President's
     desk.  All the doors are shut.  Weak sunlight filters into
     the hushed room as if to a confessional.

                    KENNY
          I don't like what's happening.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          In the morning I'm taking charge of the
          blockade from the situation room. 
          McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot
          at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things
          there.

                    KENNY
          All right.  'Cause you get armed
          boarders climbing into Soviet ships,
          shots being fired across bows...

                    THE PRESIDENT
          I know, I know...

                    KENNY
          What about these low-level flights? 
          They're starting in what?  An hour?  Do
          you realize what you're letting yourself
          in for?

                    THE PRESIDENT
          We need those flights.  We have to know
          when those missiles become operational,
          because when they do, we need to destroy
          them.

                    KENNY
          Fair enough.  But Castro's on alert and
          we're flying attack planes over their
          sites, on the deck.  There's no way for
          them to know they're carrying cameras,
          not bombs.  They're going to be shot at,
          plain and simple.

     Kenny's right, and the President looks away in frustration.

                    KENNY (CONT'D)
          I'm your political advisor, and I'm
          giving you political analysis here. 
          This is a setup.  The Chiefs want to go
          in.  It's the only way they can redeem
          themselves for the Bay of Pigs.  They
          have to go in, and they have to do it
          right.  It's that simple. 

                    THE PRESIDENT
          I'm gonna protect those pilots.

     Thep President stares intently at Kenny.  Kenny glances at
     the door, his voice hushed.  He hesitates.

                    KENNY
          They're boxing us in with these rules of
          engagement.  If you agree to 'em, and
          one of our planes gets knocked down or
          one of the ships won't stop for
          inspection, the Chiefs will have us by
          the balls and will force us to start
          shooting.  They want a war, and they're
          arranging things to get one.  If you
          don't want one, we have to do something
          about it.

     The President understands.  He shakes his head, paces away.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          How does a man get to a place where he
          can say, 'throw those lives away,' so
          easily?

                    KENNY
          Maybe it's harder for them to say it
          than they let on. 
          At the very least, they believe it's in
          our best interest.  And at the end of
          the day, they may end up being right.

     The President turns away, considers.  Then turns back.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Triple check everything the Chiefs say
          to us with the guys who actually have to
          do it.  No one's to know about this but
          Bobby.  I need redundant control over
          what happens out there.  And if things
          aren't as advertised, you're going to
          make sure they come out the way I want
          them to come out, starting with this low
          level flight thing.

     Jesus Christ...Kenny is daunted.  For a beat he just stares.

                    KENNY
          That's going to be tough.  You know how
          these guys are about their chains of
          command...

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Any problems, you remind them those
          chains of commands end at one place. 
          Me.

     INT. WEST WING HALLS - DAY

     Kenny and the President head for the Cabinet Room.  Rusk
     comes out before they get there.

                    RUSK
          Mr. President. The OAS meeting starts in
          an hour.  I haven't prepared at all.  We
          can't expect --

                    THE PRESIDENT
          -- we need this one, Dean.  The
          quarantine's legal if we get a mandate,
          otherwise it's an act of war in the eyes
          of the world.  Get me that vote.  Make
          it unanimous.

                    RUSK
          Mr. President, The Organization of
          American States hasn't had a unanimous
          vote since --

     The President moves for the Cabinet Room.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          -- unanimous, Dean.

     Kenny slaps the dismayed Rusk on the back, heads off down a
     hall away from the Cabinet Room.

     INT. WHITE HOUSE SWITCHBOARD - DAY

     Kenny opens the door to the White House switchboard room.  A
     half-dozen OPERATORS work their lines, making connections on
     the old-fashioned switchboard.  Unnoticed, he sizes them up,
     their skill.  They're all courteous, pretty, professional.

     The CAMERA PANS down the line... and stops on a middle-aged
     matron at the end - the sternest, most scary of them all. 
     Her name is MARGARET.

                    MARGARET
          White House Operator.  Yes sir.
               (beat, harsh, booming)
          Speaker McCormack, hold for the Vice
          President.

     Her voice is so severe, so smoker-gravelled, it makes the
     blood run cold.  This is the woman Kenny's looking for.

                    KENNY
          Ma'am, would you mind helping me out
          with a few special calls?

     INT. READY ROOM - KEY WEST NAS - DAY

     Ecker, Wilhemy and their Pilots are in angry debate.

                    ECKER
          Orson Welles is a hack.  Now you want to
          talk about a director, you talk about
          David Lean...

                    WILHEMY
          Welles is a G-d.  Lean's the hack.

                    ECKER
          Bullshit, Bruce, nobody but Lean is
          making decent movies these days.
               (to Young Pilot)
          Get that fixed yet?

     Nearby, a YOUNG PILOT tinkers with a $300,000 spy camera.

                    YOUNG PILOT
          Uhhh... yup.  Think so.

     Suddenly, the door opens and a pale DUTY SERGEANT enters.

                    DUTY SERGEANT
          Sir...telephone, sir.

     INT. DUTY OFFICE - DAY

     Ecker enters, marches over to the phone.  All the SOLDIERS in
     the room stare at him.  Ecker wiggles his cigar to a corner
     of his mouth, picks up, styling.

                    ECKER
          VFP-62, Fightin' Photo, here.  But what
          we really want to do is direct.

                                   INTERCUT CALL TO:

     INT. WHITE HOUSE SWITCHBOARD - CONTINUOUS

     Margaret works her magic.

                    MARGARET
          This is the White House Operator.  Hold
          for the President.

     INT. DUTY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     Ecker blinks, becomes a mild lamb.

                    ECKER
          Oh shit.

     INT. WHITE HOUSE SWITCHBOARD - CONTINUOUS

                    MARGARET
          Honey, you don't know what shit is.

     BEGIN INTERCUT

     INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     Kenny, sitting on his desk, taps his fingers, looks at the
     phone.  He's kept Ecker on hold long enough - and picks up.

                    KENNY
          Commander, my name is Ken O'Donnell. 
          Special Assistant to the President.

                                   INTERCUT CALL TO:

     INT. DUTY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     Ecker exhales.  It's not the President, but Ecker is so
     shaken up it might as well be.

                    ECKER
          Yes, sir.

                    KENNY (O.S.)
          The President has instructed me to pass
          along an order to you.
               (beat)
          You are not to get shot down.

     Did he hear right?

                    ECKER
          Uh... we'll do our best, sir.

     INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                    KENNY
          I don't think you understand me
          correctly.  You are not to get shot down
          under any circumstances.  Whatever
          happens up there, you were not shot at. 
          Mechanical failures are fine; crashing
          into mountains, fine.  But you and your
          men are not to be shot at, fired at,
          launched upon.

     INT. DUTY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     Ecker sits down in a chair, sobered.

                    ECKER
          Excuse me, sir, what's going on here?

     INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     Kenny stands, drops the hard nose bullshit.

                    KENNY
          Commander, if you are fired upon, the
          President will be forced to attack the
          sites that fire on you.  He doesn't want
          to have to do that.  It's very important
          that he doesn't, or things could go very
          badly out of control.

     INT. DUTY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     Ecker lets out a long breath.

                    ECKER
          I think I understand.  What about my
          men?  If it comes up hot and heavy, and
          we don't have anyone to protect us...
          I'm going to be writing letters to
          parents.  I hate writing letters to
          parents.

     INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     Kenny nods to himself, feeling.  He's done it himself.

                    KENNY
          If the President protects you,
          Commander, he may have to do it with the
          Bomb.

     INT. DUTY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     Ecker doesn't want to be avenged with atomic weapons.  No
     sane person would.

                    KENNY (V.O.)
          I've known the man for fifteen years. 
          The problem is, he will protect you.  So
          I'm asking: don't make him protect you. 
          Don't get shot at.

     Ecker down, deeply affected.  Suddenly, A BELL RINGS.  A
     TELETYPE goes off.  Ecker knows it's for him.  His orders.

                    ECKER
          Okay, Mr. O'Donnell.  We'll do what we
          can.

     END INTERCUT.

     As Ecker hangs up, the Duty Officer rips off the ORDERS,
     hands them to Ecker, who takes one look, then gazes out the
     window at the runway --

     EXT. RUNWAY - KEY WEST NAVAL AIR STATION - DAY

     A CART speeds down the flight line past the waiting F8U-1P
     Corsairs.  One by one, the four pilots accompanying Ecker and
     Wilhemy jump off to mount their planes.  The cart still
     moving.

                    ECKER
          Get that fuel assayed?

                    WILHEMY
          Yeah.  It sucks.  Ain't for high
          performance babies like ours.  Shoulda
          brought some from home, but what can you
          do?  Last-second deployments...

     Wilhemy jumps off, then they're at Ecker's plane, and he
     jumps off.  Too late to worry about bad fuel now.  He hoists
     himself up and into the cockpit of the sleek navy jet.

          INT. ECKER'S CRUSADER - DAY

     As the canopy closes, Ecker powers up the engines, talks to
     his flight over the Guard channel.

                    ECKER
          Okay, time to play Spin the Bottle with
          our bearded buddy.  Nobody gets out
          ahead.  Remember, just sitting here
          we're only ten minutes from target.

     EXT. RUNWAY - DAY

     The Crusaders swing around in pairs at one end of the runway,
     and then the first two throttle-up, flaps down, and drop
     their brakes.  The machines LUNGE forward like duelling drag
     racers.  The FILL THE SCREEN, blow past.

     EXT. AERIAL - OVER KEY WEST - DAY

     The six Crusaders, in pairs, streak over the buildings and
     streets of Key West.  And in a heartbeat, cross the beach and
     are out to sea.

     And already on the horizon, the low clouds and dark line of
     land.  Cuba.  Ninety miles away.

     INT. ECKER'S CRUSADER - DAY

     The ocean shrieks past so close you can see the white foam. 
     Ecker checks the altimeter: 150 FEET.

     A small fishing boat looms ahead, its net booms reaching up
     like tree limbs.  The Crusader rockets over it.

     Ecker checks his instruments.  OUT THE WINDOW, the other
     Crusaders thunder over the water, past sailboats, cabin
     cruisers, the small-craft traffic outside Key West.  The
     speed sucks the breath away.

                    ECKER
          Go to military throttle on my mark. 
          Three...two...one... mark.

     His airspeed indicator spins up to 400 knots.  And then his
     radio suddenly crackles:

                    PILOT #1 (O.S.)
          Flameout flameout!

                    PILOT #2 (O.S.)
          Shit!  Me too!

                    ECKER
          Get some altitude!

     Two of the Crusaders pull up, away from the water.

                    PILOT #1 (O.S.)
          Oh, God damn.  Got it restarted.

                    PILOT #2 (O.S.)
          Yeah.  Yeah.  Me too.  Goddamn fuel.

                    PILOT #1 (O.S.)
          Sir, I don't think she's gonna hold up
          for the run.

                    ECKER
          Affirmative.  You two get out of here.

     EXT. AERIAL - CRUSADERS - DAY

     The two planes with bad fuel pull wingovers to their left,
     head for the airfield in the distance.  The four remaining
     planes streak over the ocean.  There are no more small craft
     this far out in the strait.

     INT. ECKER'S CRUSADER - DAY

     Cuba, green and hazy, looms in the window.  Ecker throws a
     series of switches.

                    ECKER
          Start your camera checks.

     A mechanical WHINE accompanies the switch-throwing.  Ecker
     pulls the trigger on his joystick and a THUMP THUMP THUMP
     hammers away.  There are green lights across his boards.

     One of the other pilots cuts in on the radio:

                    PILOT #3 (O.S.)
          Failure.  All cameras.  Sonofabitch. 
          Film must not have fed.

                    PILOT #4 (O.S.)
          Jesus!  Shit!  Oh shit!  I just shot it
          all, boss.  Activator jammed open, its
          exposing everything now.

                    WILHEMY (O.S.)
          That's alright, Lenny, it happens to
          most men at some time --

     Ecker grimaces, but his voice stays cool.

                    ECKER
          -- Scrub, you two.  Get out of here. 
          Still with me, Bruce?

                    WILHEMY (O.S.)
          That's affirm.

     The two Crusaders who've failed their camera checks break
     off.  And now Cuba's hills, the Havana sky line are right in
     front of them.

     EXT. CUBAN BEACH - CONTINUOUS

     The last two Crusaders streak over the surf, a white wake of
     spray in their jetwash, and cross the beach with a boom.

     EXT. AERIAL - CRUSADERS - CONTINUOUS

     The planes dip and rise with the green tropical contours,
     taking us on a sickening roller-coaster ride over Cuban
     countryside at treetop level.

     Palm forest, roads, can fields, more palm forest race by. 
     And then, ahead, a large clearing.

                    ECKER (O.S.)
          Warm 'em up.  We're here.

     EXT. ANTI-AIRCRAFT BATTERY - CONTINUOUS

     Cuban ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNNERS shout as they traverse their 40mm
     guns in their sandbagged emplacement.  The low rippling
     thunder of the incoming jets becomes an earsplitting ROAR...
     and the Crusaders blast out over the clearing.  The anti
     aircraft guns open up.

     INT. WILHEMY'S CRUSADER - CONTINUOUS

     Wilhemy jinks left to avoid a streaking of TRACER FIRE.

                    WILHEMY
          Holy shit!

     INT. ECKER'S CRUSADER - CONTINUOUS

     Tracers and flack pepper the air in front of Ecker's
     Crusader.  METAL PINGS, TINKS, RATTLES off the fuselage. 
     Anti-aircraft and small arms fire comes up from all over,
     hitting the planes multiple times.  He surveys the shapes in
     the target zone dead ahead.

                    ECKER
          Lights.

     And sees the long, canvas-covered objects on the ground.  The
     missiles.  They draw closer.

                    ECKER (CONT'D)
          Camera.

     A steel fragment CRACKS his window, obscuring our view.

                    ECKER (CONT'D)
          Action.

     And he thumbs the CAMERA SWITCH.  All twelve B-system cameras
     begin banging away like cannons.

     EXT. AERIAL - CRUSADERS - DAY

     TRACERS lace the air between the two planes as they blast
     over the missile site.  Over trailers.  Over tents.  Over
     trucks.  Over trenches.  Over bulldozers.

     And then they're out over forest again.  It's all over in
     seconds.  The triple-A stops.  In unison, the two planes bank
     right, heading for the distant blue, blue sea.

     INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY

     Kenny paces by the phone.  It rings.  He picks up, listens,
     reacts.  Relief.  And we know the planes have made it back.

     EXT. RUNWAY - CECIL FIELD, FLA. - DAY

     Ecker jumps down from the cockpit ladder and turns an eye to
     his battered, pock-marked plane.  Wilhemy and the GROUND CREW
     CHIEF come running up, the Chief letting out a whistle.

                    GROUND CREW CHIEF
          Lookit what daddy done brung home.

                    WILHEMY
          You shoulda seen it, Chief, they --

                    ECKER
          -- damn sparrows.  Must've been
          migrating.  Guess I hit a couple
          hundred.
               (to Wilhemy, stern)
          How many did you hit, Bruce?

     Wilhemy stands there, looking at Ecker, not sure what to make
     of him.  The Crew Chief just starts laughing as more
     impressed GROUND CREW come up.

                    WILHEMY
          A few.  I guess.

                    GROUND CREW CHIEF
          Was them 20 or 40 million sparrows?

     Ecker, sweat-plastered and foul, steps into the Chief's face.

                    ECKER
          Those are bird strikes.  Sparrows to be
          precise.  Got a problem with that?

     The Chief stands there, glances at the plane one more time,
     and shakes his head, 'No.'  Ecker takes the Chief's
     maintenance clipboard from him, writes in big bold marker:
     BIRD STRIKES.  He thrusts it back into the Chief's hands and
     walks off; the astonished Wilhemy remains behind.

     INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY

     In Kenny's credenza, a small black and white T.V. plays. 
     WALTER CRONKITE narrates on the television as a train laden
     with TANKS on flatbeds pulls out of a station.

                    WALTER CRONKITE (V.O.)
          Massive military preparations are
          underway throughout the southeast in
          what Pentagon officials are confirming
          is the largest mobilization since Korea. 
          The railways have been nationalized to
          assist in the deployment, here
          transporting elements of the U.S. 1st
          Armored Division from Ft. Hood, Texas.

     A PHONE RINGS.  Kenny turns from the T.V., turns down Walter
     Cronkite, as he answers.

                    KENNY
          Yeah?

     INT. OAS MEETING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     George Ball stands at the back of a crowded room filled with
     applauding OAS DELEGATES.  It's for Rusk, at a podium up
     front.

                    BALL
          Kenny.  The vote just came down.

     INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY

     Kenny opens his door, lets Rusk in.  The President, Bobby and
     half of EXCOM look up.  Rusk stands there somber.

                    RUSK
          Unanimous.  One abstenation.

     And then he breaks into a huge grin.  Everyone cheers him.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          About time something went our way.

     An Assistant enters behind Kenny.  Kenny senses him, turns as
     the others move to shake hands with Rusk.

                    ASSISTANT
          Telephone, Mr. O'Donnell.

     INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY

     Kenny, grinning, ducks back into his office, closes the door
     after the Assistant leaves.  He picks up the phone.

                    KENNY
          Hello?

                                   INTERCUT CALL TO:

     INT. READY ROOM - CECIL FIELD - DAY

     Ecker stands at a phone, stares out a window at a replacement
     plane being fueled.  A Crusader, not his shot-up one.

                    ECKER
          Mr. O'Donnell, I've been ordered to
          deliver the film to the Pentagon
          personally.  What's going on?

     INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     Kenny thinks fast.  Oh shit.

                    KENNY
          The Chiefs must want to talk to you.
               (beat)
          Listen to me, Commander, they'll want to
          know if you were fired on.  Were you?

                    ECKER (O.S.)
          You could say that, sir.

                    KENNY
          Commander.  Do not, under any
          circumstances, tell the Chiefs.

     END INTERCUT

     INT. PENTAGON - DAY

     SUPER: E-RING.  Then SUPER: THE PENTAGON

     Ecker, still in his sweat-drenched flight suit approaches a
     security checkpoint.  GUARDS secure his sidearm and user him
     through a doorway.  A sign over it reads JCS.

     INT. THE TANK - DAY

     The door swings open into the Joint Chiefs' SOUND-PROOFED
     briefing room known as THE TANK.  LeMay, Taylor and Anderson
     sit there around the table.  Ecker salutes.

                    ECKER
          Commander William B. Ecker reporting as
          ordered!

     LeMay rises, prowls over to Ecker.

                    LEMAY
          Son , I want to know just one thing. 
          Those bastards shoot so much as a BB gun
          at you?

     A long beat.  Sweat runs off Ecker's head.  He can smell
     LeMay's breath.

                    ECKER
          Sir, it was a milk run, sir.

     INT. WEST WING HALL - NIGHT

     Kenny joins the President and General Taylor in the hallway
     as they head for the Oval Office.

                    GENERAL TAYLOR
          It appears our low-level flights are
          getting back okay.  Some unconfirmed
          reports of small-arms fire from some of
          the missions, but that's it.

     Slightly behind them, Kenny looks sidelong at Taylor.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few
          patriotic farmers.  And the ships?

                    GENERAL TAYLOR
          Still heading for Cuba.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          All right.  Then I guess it's time.

     INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

     FLASHBULBS go off all around the room as the President walks
     in, goes over to his desk.  Reporters observe silently, T.V.
     cameras track him; Kenny, Bobby and Sorensen watch as the
     President sits, takes a pen form his pocket.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          In accordance with this afternoon's vote
          at the OAS, the quarantine shall hereby
          be effective as of ten o'clock tomorrow
          morning.

     Kenny observes in silence as the President SIGNS the
     Proclamation of Interdiction.

     INT. OVAL OFFICE - LATER

     The Oval Office has emptied out.  Only Kenny, Bobby, Sorensen
     and the President remain.  The President looks out the
     window, Sorensen sits in a chair in front of the desk.  Bobby
     and Kenny sit on the edge of the desk.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Last summer I read a book.  The Guns of
          August.  I wish every man on that
          blockade line had read that book.

     The President moves over to the GLOBE by his desk, spins it,
     stopping in on Europe.

                    THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
          World War One.  Thirteen million killed
          all because the militaries of both
          alliances were so highly attuned to each
          other's movements and dispositions,
          afraid of letting the other guy have a
          theoretical advantage.  And your man in
          the field, his family at home, couldn't
          even tell you the reasons why their
          lives were being sacrificed.
               (beat)
          Why couldn't they stop it?

     Can we?  The President's fingers turn the globe.  It stops on
     North America.  Kenny and Bobby listen.

                    THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
          And here we are, fifty years later.  One
          of their ships resists the inspection. 
          We shoot out its rudder and board.  They
          shoot down our planes in response.  We
          bomb their anti-aircraft sites in
          response to that.  They attack Berlin. 
          We invade Cuba.  They fire their
          missiles.  We fire ours.

     The President sets the globe gently spinning and walks away.

     INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Kenny rubs his eyes, listens to his phone and the WOMAN'S
     VOICE at the other end.  It's his wife.

                    HELEN (O.S.)
          When are you going to be home?

                    KENNY
          I don't know, Helen.  I want you to keep
          the kids close tomorrow.  Leave the T.V.
          on, sleep with it on in the bedroom
          until I tell you you can turn it off.

                    HELEN (O.S.)
          What's happened?

                    KENNY
          Nothing.  Nothing you don't know about. 
          Tomorrow's the big day.  Just have the
          car ready to go if I call or if the
          Civil Defense Warning comes on.

                    HELEN (O.S.)
          What happens to you?  I'm not leaving
          without you.

                    KENNY
          I'll be evacuated with the President.

     A long silence on the other end of the line.

                    HELEN (O.S.)
          Great.  So while you're under a rock
          somewhere with the President, what am I
          supposed to do with your five children?

     And to that, there is no answer.  A beat, and it's all Kenny
     can promise:

                    KENNY
          I'll find you.  But we're not going to
          let it come to that.  I promise.

     INT. WHITE HOUSE CAFETERIA - NIGHT

     Kenny hands Bobby and Bundy cups of coffee.  The three men
     nurse them in the silence of the abandoned cafeteria.

                    KENNY
          Helen just asked me what sort of
          arrangements we have for the families.

                    BUNDY
          I just checked myself.
               (beat)
          They're being issued identity cards. 
          Call comes, and evacuation officers meet
          them at pre-arranged departure areas. 
          They go by helicopter to Mount Weather. 
          We meet them there.

     Bobby looks at his coffee, then up at Kenny.  He gently
     shakes his head.  It's all a sham.

                    BOBBY
          Course that's for morale.  The missiles
          only take five minutes to get here.

     INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     SUPER: WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 24TH.  DAY 9.

     Kenny bolts upright from his couch.  He rubs his face, sits
     on the edge in the dark for a beat.  He's not going back to
     sleep.  He grabs his trousers.

     INT. WEST WING HALLS - CONTINUOUS

     Kenny makes his way through the dim, deserted halls. 
     Somewhere in the distance a phone rings.  He reaches a door.

     EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

     Kenny, bundled in an overcoat, steps outside the North
     Entrance.  The cool air invigorates him.  He eyes the fence,
     Pennsylvania Avenue beyond it, seeming to isolate this world
     from the living city beyond.  He starts for the main gate.

     EXT. MAIN GATE - CONTINUOUS

     A WHITE HOUSE POLICE OFFICER jumps up as Kenny approaches.

                    POLICE OFFICER
          Would you like me to call a car, Mr.
          O'Donnell.

     Kenny checks his watch.

                    KENNY
          How long will it take to get someone up?

                    POLICE OFFICER
          Fifteen minutes, maybe.  To your house,
          sir?

     Kenny considers, shakes his head.  He wants to go home,
     but...

                    KENNY
          No.  No, I'll let her sleep.  Let 'em
          sleep.

     Kenny says it with a certain finality.  The Police Officer
     nods, and Kenny wanders out through the gates, shouldering
     the weight of the world.

     EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

     Kenny makes his way down a sidewalk not far from the White
     House.  A 24-hour drug store's doors are open.  He pauses.

     Inside, a knot of PEOPLE - late-night deliverymen, a cop, the
     store employees - talk in undertones at the counter.  Behind
     it, a T.V. is signing off with the national anthem.  Sober
     voices, sober looks.  Kenny moves on.

     EXT. NEWS STAND - NIGHT

     A cluster of COLLEGE STUDENTS talk at a news stand.  They're
     waiting for the NEWSIE to cut the bands of the next day's
     Washington Post, the bundles just being thrown to the
     sidewalk from the delivery truck.  Kenny approaches.

     In their thing beards, counter-culture clothes, the kids seem
     so young, Kenny so old.  Kenny buys a newspaper, its dire
     headlines, every story about the crisis.

     EXT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - NIGHT

     Kenny, newspaper under his arm, continues down the street. 
     Up ahead, the lights are on in a Catholic Church.  Lines of
     CHURCHGOERS are at the door.  Kenny stops, surprised at the
     sight this late.  And then he sees the hand-painted banner:
     CONFESSIONS 24 HOURS.  PRAY FOR PEACE.

     Kenny is moved.  He glances over his shoulder, and then...
     joins the line himself.

     INT. WHITE HOUSE - SITUATION ROOM - DAY

     Kenny's WATCH reads one minute til ten o'clock.  PULL BACK TO
     REVEAL:

     Kenny, standing just inside the open doors to the White House
     Situation Room, a state-of-the-art conference room.  A long,
     central table surrounded by leather chairs with phones and
     screens built in.  T.V. monitors hang from the ceilings in
     the corners.  There are no windows, just oppressive bunker
     like walls.  It's far underground.

     Across the room the President paces, phone in hand.  Half of
     EXCOM is in their seats.  The other half, along with a steady
     stream of DUTY OFFICERS, are coming and going.  Kenny steps
     aside for a Duty Officer, listens to the President.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Okay, Bob, I'm putting you on intercom.

     Suddenly, McNamara's VOICE fills the room.

                    MCNAMARA (O.S.)
          Hey, guys, can you hear me?

                                   SMASH CUT TO:

     INT. FLAG PLOT - THE PENTAGON - DAY

     McNamara stands, phone in hand.

                    MCNAMARA
          I have one minute til ten here --

     THE CAMERA TRACKS AROUND HIM, REVEALING:

     A large, elaborate war room, like Mission Control.  Big
     screens, plexiglass tracking boards, tiered banks of
     communications equipment.  A massive LIGHT TABLE on the floor
     at the center of the room projects a map of the Caribbean and
     Atlantic.  Arcing across it is a RED LINE: the blockade.

     The map is covered with cryptic military notations; WATCH
     OFFICERS on a platform which swings out over it update the
     latest ship positions.

     McNamara's in a booth overlooking the room.  It's open to the
     next tier below where Admiral Anderson is giving orders.

                    MCNAMARA (CONT'D)
          -- and no sign of them stopping.

     INT. SITUATION ROOM - DAY

     Kenny and Bobby move to the President's end of the table, sit
     down across from each other in mirror-image fashion.  EXCOM
     looks to the President.  The second hand of the clock on the
     wall wheels past 12.  A hush falls over the room.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Bob, the quarantine is now in effect.

     INT. FLAG PLOT - DAY

     McNamara is mute for a beat.  He turns to view the big room.

                    MCNAMARA
          Then it looks like our first customers
          are the Gagarin and Kimovsk.

     He nods to Admiral Anderson, who calls an order down to a
     Watch Officer on the floor, and on screens all around the
     room, a sector of the map MAGNIFIES the unfolding encounter --

     EXT. BRIDGE WING - U.S.S. PIERCE - DAY

     -- between the destroyer, U.S.S. Pierce and the SOVIET
     FREIGHTERS Gagarin and Kimovsk.  The Pierce's bridge wings
     are crammed with helmeted OFFICERS and LOOKOUTS.  They peer
     through binoculars at the distant ships, plowing ahead,
     straight for them.  The CAPTAIN lowers his binoculars,
     determined.

                    CAPTAIN
          Helm, shape heading for intercept, zero
          one zero.  All ahead full --

                    OFFICER (O.S.)
          -- new contact!  New contact!

     Everyone whirls to the bridge.  The Captain steps forward.

     INT. COMBAT INFORMATION CENTER - U.S.S. PIERCE - DAY

     The Captain ducks into the CIC.  The CHIEF SONARAN reports.

                    CHIEF SONARMAN
          Submerged contact, designation Sierra
          one at 6000 yards bearing 030.

                    CAPTAIN
          A submarine...

     INT. SITUATION ROOM - DAY

     The President reacts.  Kenny and Bobby react.

                    GENERAL TAYLOR
          It's protecting the freighters.

     Consternation.  The President picks up the phone.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Bob, is there any way we can avoid
          stopping a submarine first?

                    MCNAMARA (O.S.)
          I'm afraid not, Mr. President.  The sub
          has positioned itself between the Pierce
          and the Soviet ships.  Admiral Anderson
          insists it's too much of a risk to
          proceed with stopping the freighters. 
          The Pierce would be a sitting duck for
          the sub.

     All around the room frustration.  Bobby shakes his head. 
     Kenny sinks back in his chair.  The President hesitates.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Put me through to the Pierce.

     INT. FLAG PLOT - DAY

     Admiral Anderson nods to a COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER.  The man
     makes the connection on a switchboard.

     McNamara casts an eye to the map.  The two red MARKERS
     labeled Gagarin and Kimovsk are joined by a third: the SUB. 
     They are ALMOST TOUCHING the blockade line.  On the other
     side, the single blue marker for the Pierce.

     INT. BRIDGE - U.S.S. PIERCE - DAY

     The Captain enters the bridge, takes the phone from the arm
     of his chair.

                    CAPTAIN
          Mr. President?

     INT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     The President holds the phone, agonized.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Captain, can you force that submarine to
          the surface for inspection without
          damaging it yourself?

     INT. BRIDGE, U.S.S. PIERCE - DAY

                    CAPTAIN
          I can bring it up, Mr. President.  But
          whether it's damaged or not is up to the
          sub.

     INT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     The President lowers the phone, looks to Bobby and Kenny.

                    MCCONE
          Even if they force it up, that sub will
          be inspected over the crews' dead
          bodies.  They'd be executed for allowing
          it when they got home.

     All eyes are on the President.  His eyes are closed tight,
     face gray, hand over his mouth.  The time of decision is at
     hand.  He lifts the phone once again.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Captain, force the sub to the surface
          for inspection.

                    MCNAMARA (O.S.)
          Mr. President!  We're receiving reports
          that the ships are stopping!

                    THE PRESIDENT
               (to phone)
          Captain, belay that order!
               (to McNamara)
          Bob, where's that coming from!

                    MCNAMARA (O.S.)
          Just a second, Mr. President.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Will somebody find out what's going on?!

     McCone jumps up, leaves the room.  The President looks at
     Kenny, tense.  Everyone holds their breath.

                    RUSK
          Are they stopping?

     The HISS of static on the open line fills the room.  Silence.

     EXT. BRIDGE - U.S.S. JOHN R. PIERCE - CONTINUOUS

     Lookouts peer across the water at the oncoming Soviet
     Freighter.

     BINOCULAR POV:

     Of the Soviet Bridge, where their LOOKOUTS are staring right
     back through their binoculars.

     INT. SITUATION ROOM - DAY

     The HISS of static.  And then.

                    MCNAMARA (O.S.)
          Mr. President?

     INT. FLAG PLOT - THE PENTAGON - CONTINUOUS

     McNamara is grinning wildly at the chaos unfolding in the
     flag plot below.  Phones are ringing everywhere.

     ON THE LIGHT TABLE

     The Watch Officers' hands fly from one notation to the other,
     circling the Soviet ships, marking them DEAD IN THE WATER.

                    MCNAMARA
          -- we've got reports coming from all
          over!  The ships are stopping!  Some...
          are turning around!

     INT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     The room EXPLODES, victorious.  Kenny and Bobby break into
     big grins, grab each other.  Kenny pumps the President's
     hand.  Rusk and Bundy slap each other on the back.

                    RUSK
          We were eyeball to eyeball and I think
          the other fellow just blinked.

     The ruckus goes on for a minute.  McCone comes back in.

                    MCCONE
          Mr. President.

     His voice is lost in the celebration.  McCone calls out:

                    MCCONE (CONT'D)
          Mr. President!

     The hubub dies away.

                    MCCONE (CONT'D)
          Sir, we have the tally from NSA.  We
          have twenty ships stopping and or
          turning around.  Six, however, appear to
          be continuing for the line.  Including
          the Gagarin and Kimovsk.

     The elation goes out of the room.  Kenny looks at the
     President.  The President picks up the phone again.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Captain, have the ships you're observing
          changed course?

                    CAPTAIN (O.S.)
          No, Mr. President.  They've just crossed
          the quarantine line.

     Bobby grips the edge of the table, immediately believing.

                    BOBBY
          It's an accident.  They must not have
          gotten their orders yet.  Let 'em go.

                    GENERAL TAYLOR
          Unlikely, Mr. President.  We've been
          monitoring transmissions from both the
          Gagarin and Kimovsk.  Their radios are
          working fine.

                    MCCONE
          One ship, an accident maybe.  Six: this
          is intentional.

     The President looks to Bobby.  He has no answer.  Kenny's
     mind races over the variables, and he leans forward, intense,
     suddenly understanding in a flash of insight:

                    KENNY
          They're right.  This is intentional.

     He glances around the room.  All of EXCOM is looking at him. 
     Bobby stares at Kenny, too shocked to feel betrayed.

                    KENNY (CONT'D)
          Khruschev's stopped the 20 ships which
          are carrying contraband, and he's
          letting the ones which aren't go
          through, hoping for an incident.  I
          think we should let them go.

     Bobby relaxes.  Around the table there are nods.

                    MCCONE
          If we do, it erodes the credibility of
          the quarantine.  He'll just send more
          through tomorrow.

     The President looks at Kenny.

                    KENNY
          Then we deal with it tomorrow.  But
          today he's stopped most of them.  He's
          done something smart here.  We gave him
          an ultimatum, and he's agreed to most of
          it, preserving just enough room to save
          face.  We need to do something just as
          smart now.

     Bobby's nodding, following the argument.  Kenny looks around
     the room for support.

          INT. FLAG PLOT - THE PENTAGON - CONTINUOUS

     McNamara, pacing on the phone, jumps in.

                    MCNAMARA
          Mr. President, I agree.  Let them go. 
          Four of the six continuing ships are
          still a day away from the line.  They've
          stopped all the ones we suspect have
          weapons aboard. 
          It would look bad shooting up a
          freighter full of baby food.

     INT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     The President holds Kenny's gaze, then lifts the phone.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Captain, I want you to maintain contact
          with those ships.  Do nothing until I
          order otherwise.  Is that clear?

                    CAPTAIN (O.S.)
          Yes, Mr. President.  Contact only.

     He hangs up, turns to Kenny.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          I hope you're right.

     EXT. SOUTH LAWN - DAY

     Kenny, Bobby and the President make their way across the
     lawn, out of earshot of the building.

                    BOBBY
          What happened to speak when spoken to?

                    KENNY
          Give it a rest.  You were thinking the
          same thing, just didn't have the guts to
          take the heat.

     Bobby likes getting under Kenny's skin.  Bobby aims a punch
     at his head which Kenny knocks away.  The President changes
     gear, serious.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          We can horsetrade with Khruschev on
          ships.  But it doesn't get us any closer
          to removing those missiles.

                    KENNY
          Have to hope it's a signal that he'll
          back down on the real issue too.

                    BOBBY
          We're going to have to stop a ship
          eventually, show the quarantine's got
          teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          McNamara's on his way back here now.  We
          need to pick the right ship.  No subs. 
          No armed boarding parties either.  We
          need a little more time to figure this
          one out.

                    KENNY
          Then let's move the quarantine line.

     It's a simple suggestion.  The President considers him a
     beat, and then McNamara emerges from the White House, heads
     for them.  The three friends assume their more reserved,
     political faces as he comes up.

                    MCNAMARA
          Mr. President.  Bobby.  Kenny.  The
          Essex battle group has the Gagarin,
          Kimovsk and the sub escort under their
          thumb.  We've got a few hours now before
          we need to worry about any more
          flashpoints on the line.
               (beat)
          We could use a few more hours.  I think
          we should consider moving the quarantine
          line back to 500 miles.

     Bobby and the President look at Kenny like he's some kind of
     Svengali.  Kenny just stands there, poker faced.

     INT. WEST WING - DAY

     Kenny and McNamara enter the White House from the South Lawn. 
     They stride down the hall, side by side.

                    KENNY
          Moving the line.  Stroke of genius.

                    MCNAMARA
               (snappish)
          Of course it is.  But the President
          needs to realize we're going to have to
          stop a ship eventually.

     They turn a corner, silence for a beat.

                    KENNY
          The Chiefs are looking for a provocation
          out there.  The President's going to
          come under enormous pressure.  You have
          to keep 'em on a short leash, Bob.

     McNamara spares Kenny a short, nasty look.

                    MCNAMARA
          You must think I'm blind and stupid. 
          I've already gotten the birds and bees
          from Bobby.  The President doesn't have
          to double-barrel me.

                    KENNY
          Listen to me, goddamn it.  We're talking
          about a possible nuclear war.  You
          dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --

                    MCNAMARA
          -- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't
          drop --

                    KENNY
          You were in the room.  It was your
          purview.  It was your job to make sure
          Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you
          didn't do it.  You've got the most
          important job in the world right now. 
          You're the smartest guy the President
          has.
               (beat)
          Besides me.

     That gets an amused snort from McNamara, breaking the
     tension.

                    MCNAMARA
          Anybody ever tell you you're an
          egomaniac and a prick, O'Donnell?

     Kenny stares him in the eye, serious, hushed.  A friend.

                    KENNY
          You need to be the best you've ever
          been.

     McNamara enters the elevator.  He turns, stands there facing
     Kenny for a dramatic beat.  Then the doors close.

     INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY

     WALTER CRONKITE, on the B&W T.V. screen, sits in front of a
     map showing Cuba and the blockade line.

                    WALTER CRONKITE (V.O.)
          -- well, it appears the world has just
          received a reprieve.  Defense Secretary
          Robert McNamara has announced that the
          quarantine zone has been moved from 800
          to 500 miles.

     PULL BACK, REVEALING:

     Kenny watching the T.V., is yelling at the phone.

                    KENNY
          Find out how close our exercises are
          coming to their cruise missiles.  I'm
          calling you back in five, and you will
          have an answer for me or I will come
          down there and beat the shit out of you.
               (beat)
          Then you can press charges, and I'll get
          a Presidential pardon.

     He hangs up, hears SHOUTING from the Oval Office.  He goes to
     the door, enters --

     INT. OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     -- and sees the President leaning over his desk, jabbing his
     finger at General Taylor.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          -- how the goddamn hell did this happen? 
          I'm going to have Power's head on a
          platter next to LeMay's!
               (noticing Kenny)
          Hey, Kenny, did you hear me give the
          order to go to DEFCON 2?  I remember
          giving the order to go to DEFCON 3, but
          I must be suffering from amnesia because
          I've just been informed our nuclear
          forces are DEFCON 2!

     Kenny realizes he's not joking as he spots Bobby sitting on
     the couch behind Taylor, pale as a ghost.  Taylor, embattled,
     wants to die, but stands there like a man.

                                   SMASH CUT TO:

     INT. MISSILE SILO - DAY

     CLOSE ON

     The nose cone of a TITAN MISSILE, its 20 megaton nuclear
     warhead wrapped in the steel re-entry shell.  Cold, silent,
     fearsome.

                    GENERAL TAYLOR (V.O.)
          Mr. President, the orders were limited
          to our strategic forces in the
          continental U.S.

     INT. OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     Taylor continues on.

                    GENERAL TAYLOR
          Technically, General LeMay is correct
          that SAC has the statutory authority --

     The President punches his desk.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          -- I have the authority.  I am the
          commander-in-chief of the United States,
          and I say when we go to war!

                    GENERAL TAYLOR
          We are not at war, sir, not until we're
          at DEFCON 1.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          General, the Joint Chiefs have just
          signalled our intent to escalate to the
          Soviets.  You have signalled an
          escalation which I had no wish to
          signal, and which I did not approve.  

     But Taylor knows this very well.  And the way he's suffering,
     it's clear he's taking the heat for his underlings.  From
     over on the couch Bobby chimes in:

                    BOBBY
          LeMay... he's history.

     The President glances at Kenny who stands there, speechless.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Get out of here, Max.

     The General leaves.  Kenny closes the door, wanders deeper
     into the office.  He looks from the President to Bobby. 
     There's a long, long beat of shocked silence.

                    KENNY
          Jesus...

                    BOBBY
          Rescind the order.  Can all the Chiefs. 
          Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the
          Undersecretaries in charge.

                    KENNY
          We can't do that, Bobby.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          He's right, we can't rescind DEFCON 2. 
          The Soviets will think we've gotten
          sweet on them.

                    KENNY
          And we can't purge the Chiefs.  Our
          invasion talk will look like a bluff. 
          Or even that there's been an attempted
          coup.

     Bobby is disgusted, but knows they're right.

                    BOBBY
          McNamara won't be able to handle them. 
          It's too much for one man...
               (knowing look to Kenny)
          ...with all due respect to our heroic
          fifth column.

     The President collapses in his rocking chair.  Kenny leans
     over the back of the sofa next to Bobby.

                    KENNY
          We've got Khruschev's attention with the
          blockade.  If we want a political
          solution.  I think it's time to turn up
          the diplomatic heat.  Cause if we let
          this go on too long, we're going to find
          ourselves in a war.

     Bobby looks at the President, meaningful.  The President
     turns to Kenny.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          I've been considering a variation on one
          of Stevenson's ideas.  We're going to
          send up a trial balloon through Lippman. 
          The Jupiter missiles.

     EXT. WEST WING DRIVEWAY - DAY

     SUPER: THURSDAY, OCTOBER 25TH.  DAY 10.

     The West Wing looms behind Kenny and Bundy.  Kenny, poker
     faced, takes a drag on his cigarette.  Bundy nervously flicks
     his, looks away from Kenny a beat.

                    BUNDY
          What did you think of Lippman's column
          this morning?

                    KENNY
          I think it's a bad idea.

     Bundy turns back to him.

                    BUNDY
          Thank God.  Look, everyone is furious
          about it.  We trade away our missiles in
          Turkey and we're fucked politically.

     Kenny grinds his jaw, but doesn't say anything.  He agrees. 
     Bundy steps up to him, confiding.

                    BUNDY (CONT'D)
          You gotta stop 'em.  We know it's Jack
          and Bobby's idea - they leaked it to
          Lippman.  The military guys are going
          ape, and they're not alone.

                    KENNY
          Then they should speak up.

                    BUNDY
          Christ, Ken, you know it's not that
          easy.

                    KENNY
          Yes it is.

                    BUNDY
          No it isn't.  They don't trust the
          people that feel this way.  But these
          people are right.  And the Kennedys are
          wrong.
               (beat)
          We need you to tell 'em, Kenny.  They'll
          listen to you.

     Kenny prickles, intense, but Bundy presses on, too wrapped up
     in his own thinking to notice.

                    BUNDY (CONT'D)
          Jack and Bobby are good men.  But it
          takes a certain character, moral
          toughness to stand up to --

                    KENNY
          -- You listen to me.  Nobody, nobody,
          talks about my friends that way.  You're
          fucking here right now because of the
          Kennedys.  They may be wrong.  They make
          mistakes.  But they're not weak. 
          The weak ones are these 'people' who
          can't speak their own minds.

                    BUNDY
          You know I don't mean they're weak.

     Kenny gets in his face, intimidating.

                    KENNY
          No, they just lack 'moral toughness.' 
          And you think I'll play your Judas.  You
          WASPS and blue-bloods never understood
          us, thinking we want into your club. 
          Well we got our own club now.
               (beat)
          And you guys don't realize fighting with
          each other is our way.  Nobody plays us
          off each other.  And nobody ever gets
          between us...

     INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Kenny throws himself on a chair in the bedroom's sitting
     area, newspaper in hand.  The President, buttoning his shirt
     in a full-length mirror, sees him.  There's a TV on.  The
     President selects a tie from a nearby rack, eyes the paper.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          What's that?

                    KENNY
          Oh, just a bunch of crap about
          withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in
          Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in
          Cuba.

     The President's eyes flick over to him in the mirror.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          I don't want to listen to this again.

                    KENNY
          If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to
          extortion, and NATO would never trust us
          again.  We'll get clobbered in world
          opinion.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          It's a goddman trial balloon.  Trial is
          the operative word, here.

                    KENNY
          Then somebody'd better deny it publicly.

     The President turns around, heads over to the T.V.  Kenny
     folds his arms, disgusted.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Jesus Christ, O'Donnell, you're the one
          saying we need to move forward on a
          political solution.

                    KENNY
          Yeah, a good political solution.

     ON THE T.V.

     Live coverage of the United Nations Security Council
     meetings.  Holding forth in Russian is VALERIAN ZORIN, 50s,
     tough, likeable, the Soviet Ambassador to the U.N. and
     chairman of the Security Council.  A translator relays the
     meaning.

                    TRANSLATOR FOR ZORIN (O.S.)
          We call on the world to condemn the
          piratical actions of America...

     RESUME

     The President's jaw tightens.  He turns to Kenny.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          You want to turn up the heat?  You call
          Adlai.  Tell him to stick it to Zorin.

     INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY

     Kenny, phone to his ear, suffers as Bobby harangues him.

                    BOBBY
          Adlai's too weak!  We have to convince
          Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.

                    KENNY
          You can't take him out this late in the
          game.

                    BOBBY
          Zorin will eat him alive!

                    KENNY
          Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. 
          The two of you don't need any advice to
          get into trouble.

                    BOBBY
          What's gotten into you?

     Kenny throws the Lippman article at him.

                    BOBBY (CONT'D)
          Oh, still sore about this.

                    KENNY
          Something your father would've come up
          with.

     Silence.  Terrible silence.  That paralyzes Bobby.  Kenny
     stares at him.  He means it, but regrets it, too.

                    BOBBY
          My father --

                    KENNY
          -- I'm just trying to make a point. 
          This idea is that fucking bad.

     But Bobby gets it.  Kenny shifts gears, lets it go.

                    KENNY (CONT'D)
          Adlai can handle Zorin.  He knows the
          inning and the score.

                    BOBBY
          He better.  Because nobody thinks he's
          up to this.  Nobody.

     INT. U.S. OFFICES - U.N. - DAY

     The U.S. suite is in frantic preparation, STAFFERS coming and
     going.  Stevenson takes his phone from a SECRETARY.

                    ADLAI
          Yes?

     INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     Kenny turns to gaze at his little T.V. in the credenza, U.N.
     coverage continuing, as if he could see Adlai there.

                    KENNY
          Adlai, it's Kenny.  How're you doing?

     INT. U.S. OFFICES - U.N. - CONTINUOUS

     Adlai is packing up his briefcase.

                    ADLAI
          Busy, Ken. What do you need?

     INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     Kenny rises from his chair, paces toward the T.V.  He pauses.

                    KENNY
          The President told me to pass the word
          to you: stick it to them.

     INT. U.S. OFFICES - U.N. - CONTINUOUS

     Adlai looks around to his own T.V., showing the session going
     on downstairs.  Zorin, ON CAMERA, dominates the council:
     alternately bold, aggressive, and then reasonable.  Even in
     Russian, with the lagging translation, he's formidable.

     INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     Kenny is watching exactly the same performance.  Zorin is
     masterful.  Kenny knows it.  And when he talks to Adlai, it's
     with the fatalism of a coach knowing he's putting his third
     string quarterback in against the all-Pro linebacker.

                    KENNY
          Adlai.  The world has to know we're
          right.  If we're going to have a chance
          at a political solution, we need
          international pressure.  You got to be
          tough, Adlai.  You need to find it, old
          friend.

     INT. U.S. OFFICES - U.N. - CONTINUOUS

     Adlai watches his Staffers leave his inner office.  He hears
     Kenny, and everything Kenny is saying.

                    ADLAI
          I hear you.  I'm glad it's you calling. 
          I thought it would be Bobby.  If they're
          still sticking to their stonewall
          strategy, I'll get 'em.
               (beat)
          Thanks, Ken.

     Adlai lowers the phone to its cradle.  An ANXIOUS STAFFER
     sticks his head in the door, a concerned, questioning look on
     his face.

     Adlai adjusts his tie.  HIS HAND IS SHAKING.  He notices it,
     and manages a brave smile.

                    ADLAI (CONT'D)
          I'm an old political cat, Jimmy.
               (beat)
          But I've got one life left.

     INT. HALL, U.N. - CONTINUOUS

     Adlai, briefcase in hand, marches down the hall at the hand
     of his team: Staffers and Photo Interpreters with large
     leather portfolio bags.  The big double doors to the council
     chamber loom, and he gestures to the Photo Interpreters.

                    ADLAI
          Wait here.

     And then a DOORMAN throws open the door for him.

     INT. U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS

     Adlai enters.  He is instantly dwarfed by the enormous room. 
     Lights, T.V. cameras, the imposing circular arrangement of
     delegation tables.  And the entire world is watching.

     Adlai pauses.  Then as the first SECURITY COUNCIL MEMBERS
     begin to notice him, he heads for the vacant seats for the
     American delegation.  The ROMANIAN DELEGATE saws the air.

                    ROMANIAN DELEGATE
               (through translator)
          ...we call upon the world to condemn
          this purely American provocation...

     But as the Romanian wheezes on, all eyes are on Adlai.  Adlai
     takes his seat, his Staffers behind him.  They pass him up
     papers, and he spreads them before him, taking no notice that
     the entire room is staring at him.

     Adlai finally glances up.  Across the circle sits Zorin, in
     the flesh, at the head of his own tough-looking DELEGATION. 
     He acknowledges Adlai with a superior smile.

                    ROMANIAN DELEGATE (CONT'D)
          We, the people of Romania, stand in
          solidarity with the people of Cuba and
          their revolution in the face of this
          American threat to world peace.  Thank
          you, Mr. Chairman.

     The Romanian Delegate leans back from his microphone.  Zorin
     leans forward, begins in Russian, and the Translator's voice
     catches up with him.  His tone, body language, composure are
     all that of complete confidence.

                    ZORIN
               (through translator)
          We are glad you could join us, Mr.
          Stevenson.

     Adlai nods, returns to his notes, as Zorin continues.

                    ZORIN (CONT'D)
          For the last couple of hours I have
          heard nothing but questions from the
          world here.  The United States has led
          us to the brink of calamity.  The
          peoples of the world want to know why. 
          We are told again and again of this so
          called incontrovertible evidence of
          offensive weapons in Cuba.  Yet we are
          not allowed to see this evidence.  Are
          your spy planes so secret you cannot
          share this evidence with us?  Some
          planes?!

     The audience laughs.  Zorin basks in it.  And then grows
     stern.

                    ZORIN (CONT'D)
          Or perhaps there is no such evidence. 
          Perhaps the United States is mistaken.

     INT. SITUATION ROOM - WHITE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     EXCOM watches the coverage on the situation room's T.V.'s. 
     The President and Bobby sit side by side, Kenny just behind
     them.  Bobby checks his watch, looks at the President.

                    BOBBY
          I make the call, and Adlai is out. 
          McCloy goes in.

     Bobby looks back at Kenny. 

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

     INT. U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS

     Zorin stares at Adlai.  Adlai studiously ignores him, works
     on his own papers.

                    ZORIN
          The United States has no facts in hand. 
          Falsity is what America has in its hands
          - false evidence.

     Zorin leans back in his chair.  Adlai finally looks up.  He
     meets Zorin's icy bravura.  He notes the cameras around the
     room.  This is the grandest stage of all.

                    ZORIN (CONT'D)
          The chair recognizes the representative
          from the United States.

     And in that moment, Adlai becomes the spokesman for America.

                    ADLAI
          Well, let me say something to you, Mr.
          Ambassador, we do have the evidence.  We
          have it, and it is clear and
          incontrovertible.

     Adlai's tone is definitive.  A tremor of interest passes
     through the various delegations.

                    ADLAI (CONT'D)
          And let me say something else.  Those
          weapons must be taken out of Cuba.  You,
          the Soviet Union, have created this new
          danger, not the United States.

     INT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     EXCOM is transfixed by the continuing debate.

                    BUNDY
          Come on, Adlai!

     They all crowd the T.V. as if it were a title fight.  Except
     for Bobby.  Kenny glances over at him.  He has the phone
     pinned between his ear and shoulder.  Kenny looks back to the
     T.V.

     INT. U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS

     Adlai fixes Zorin in his seat, his voice rising.

                    ADLAI
          Mr. Zorin, I remind you that the other
          day you did not deny the existence of
          these weapons.  But today, again, if I
          heard you correctly, you now say they do
          not exist.

     Zorin, headphones on, listens to his own translation, but
     doesn't respond, acts bored.  It gets Adlai's goat, and he
     begins to lose his cool.  A rumble from the U.N.  The CAMERA
     FINDS Adlai's hand SHAKING, gripping his pen.

     INT. SITUATION ROOM - WHITE HOUSE - DAY

     EXCOM is worried.

                    RUSK
          Come on, Adlai, don't let him off!

                    BOBBY
          John?  It's Bobby.  Get ready to send
          your staffer in.  He's going to be
          coming out.

     INT. U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS

     But Adlai's tremors are not tremors of fear.  They are
     tremors of anger.  His voice goes hard and cold.

                    ADLAI
          All right, sir.  Let me ask you one
          simple question.  Do you, Ambassador
          Zorin, deny that the U.S.S.R. has placed
          and is placing medium and intermediate
          range missiles and sites in Cuba?  Yes
          or no - don't wait for the translation -
          yes or no?

     The diplomatic world GASPS as Adlai drops all pretense of
     civility, all statesman-like grace.

     INT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     EXCOM's excitement mounts.  In the chorus urging Adlai on, we
     find Kenny edge toward the screen.

                    KENNY
          Yeah.  Yeah.

     INT. U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS

     Zorin shoots Adlai a testy look.

                    ZORIN
          I am not in an American courtroom, sir,
          and therefore I do not wish to answer a
          question that is put to me in the
          fashion in which a prosecutor puts
          questions.  In due course, sir, you will
          have your answer.

     There's laughter at Zorin's refusal to be bullied: but it's
     nervous laughter, not the polite stuff of diplomatic tete-a
     tete.  The RUMBLE in the room grows louder.

                    ADLAI
          You are in the courtroom of world
          opinion right now, and you can answer
          yes or no.  You have denied they exist,
          and I want to know if I have understood
          you correctly.

          INT. SITUATION ROOM - DAY

     EXCOM ROARS!  Fists in the air!  Bobby lets the phone dangle
     a beat, covers it.  And then he lifts it again.

                    BOBBY
          John, I'll get back to you.

     He lowers the phone to the receiver.  Kenny shoots him a
     triumphant smile.  The President looks at Kenny, shakes his
     head, a big smile on his face.

     INT. U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS

     Adlai presses on.

                    ADLAI
          And I'm prepared to present the evidence
          in this room, proving that the Soviet
          Union has lied to the world.

     And Zorin cracks.  He looks uneasily to his delegation.  They
     bend forward to consult.  Adlai sits back in his chair,
     draping his arms over its wings with the confidence of
     someone who knows he's kicked ass.

     Adlai looks around the room while he's waiting for his
     answer, managing not to smile.  The diplomatic world is
     scandalized.  At last Zorin regroups, lifts his head from his
     huddle.

                    ZORIN
          If you do not choose to continue your
          statement, the Chair recognizes the
          representative from Chile.

     The CHILEAN DELEGATE stands.

                    CHILEAN DELEGATE
          I yield my time and the floor to the
          representative to the United States.

     The room explodes in laughter.  Not just nervous any more,
     not just polite.  They're laughing at Zorin's parliamentary
     ploy blowing up in his face. 
     Zorin's smile is gone, his smooth facade destroyed.  And he
     looks like the biggest fool in the world.

     Adlai stares at the beet-faced man with disdain.  At last,
     Adlai stands, gestures to the door to the hall behind him.

     The PHOTO INTERPRETERS come racing in with their briefing
     boards.

                    ADLAI
          Well then, ladies and gentlemen, since
          it appears we might be here for a while,
          shall we have a look at what the Soviets
          are doing in Cuba?

     The Delegates RUMBLE in interest, rise from their seats to
     approach Adlai.

     INT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     EXCOM celebrates.  Phones ring at several of the chairs at
     the conference table. The President and Kenny meet as Bundy
     picks up a phone in the b.g.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Didn't know Adlai had it in him.  Too
          bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.

                    KENNY
          Zorin must not have gotten instructions. 
          Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's
          blown it big-time.

     Bundy steps forward, holding the phone.

                    BUNDY
          Mr. President...

     Kenny and the President turn to see what they already have
     heard in those two words: concern.  The room falls quiet.

     INT. FLAG PLOT - THE PENTAGON - CONTINUOUS

     Phone in hand, McNamara paces at his post over the flag plot.

                    MCNAMARA
          ...the ship is called Groznyy.

     EXT. OCEAN, PUERTO RICO TRENCH - CONTINUOUS

     The Soviet Tanker, Groznyy, breasts the heavy seas.  Armed
     CREWMEN race along the deck to makeshift sandbagged
     emplacements in the bow.

                    MCNAMARA (V.O.)
          We lost track of it yesterday at
          nightfall.  We thought we gave it plenty
          of room when we moved the quarantine
          line back.  We just reacquired it.

     The CAMERA PANS to the left, revealing a U.S. DESTROYER
     racing up alongside a few hundred yards away, pounding up and
     over the swells, punching up a huge fan of spray from its
     bow.

     INT. FLAG PLOT - THE PENTAGON - CONTINUOUS

                    MCNAMARA
          It crossed the line hours ago.

     Admiral Anderson, on the phone on the level below, is tense.

                    ADMIRAL ANDERSON
          Hail them again.

                    THE PRESIDENT (O.S.)
          Keep us posted, Bob.

     McNamara leans against the wall, closes his eyes in
     exhaustion and stress.  And when he opens the, we PAN AROUND
     TO REVEAL:

     A G-d-like view of the flag plot, covered with HUNDREDS OF
     SHIPS, PLANES AND MARKINGS.

     McNamara stares out at the bewildering tangle of symbols,
     living men behind each one.  Each tangle of red and blue
     symbols a powderkeg.  A G-dlike view indeed.  And it is far
     more than any one mere man could keep control of. And he
     begins to realize it.

                    MCNAMARA
          We're kidding ourselves...

     And not only that, in his bleary, sleep-deprived fog, he
     begins to understand something happening down there.

     The CAMERA MOVES over the enormous map, over the scrolling
     cryptic numerology.  THE BUZZ of radio communications bleeds
     in from the background.  The overhead platform swivels on its
     motor, like the vast arm of some fate-writing god as the
     Watch Officer on it updates the movements of the ships.

     McNamara stares, at the verge of grasping something.  Through
     the door-crack of genius, he has the glimpse of some grander
     thing, some grander design.

                    ADMIRAL ANDERSON
          Very well.  Load your guns.

     That starts McNamara from his fatigued reverie.  He goes to
     the railing, looks down on Anderson.

                    MCNAMARA
          What was that, Admiral?

     Anderson turns, gazes up from his tier below, distracted.

                    ADMIRAL ANDERSON
          We've been hailing the Groznyy for the
          last hour, Mr. Secretary.  The Groznyy
          refuses to stop.

                    MCNAMARA
          What are you doing?

                    ADMIRAL ANDERSON
          Carrying out our mission, Mr. Secretary. 
          If you don't mind, we're very busy right
          now.  We need to be able to do our jobs.

                    MCNAMARA
          Admiral, I asked you a question.

     Anderson holds the phone aside, turns around again, looks up
     at him, impatient.  His answer is hard, cold, dangerous.

                    ADMIRAL ANDERSON
          We're going to follow the Rules of
          Engagement.  The Rules of Engagement
          which the President has approved and
          signed in his order of October 23rd.

     Anderson listens again to the phone.

                    ADMIRAL ANDERSON (CONT'D)
          Yes, Captain, you may proceed.  Clear
          your guns.

                    MCNAMARA
          What --

     EXT. OCEAN, PUERTO RICO TRENCH - CONTINUOUS

     The Destroyer's forward 5-inch twin guns swivel, train on the
     Groznyy.  A beat.  They OPEN FIRE with an ear-splitting
     BAMBAM, ripping the air in front of the muzzles, the Groznyy
     so close a miss isn't possible.

     INT. FLAG PLOT - THE PENTAGON - CONTINUOUS

     McNamara SHOUTS at Anderson, dropping down the steps to
     Anderson's level.

                    MCNAMARA
          GODDAMNIT, STOP THAT FIRING!

     Watch Officers scramble to comply, chaos and shouting in the
     war room as a chorus if "Cease fire cease fire cease fire,"
     goes up.  McNamara turns on Anderson, is in his face.

                    MCNAMARA (CONT'D)
          Jesus Christ, God help us.

     Anderson smashes the phone down, wheels on McNamara, furious.

     EXT. OCEAN, PUERTO RICO TRENCH - CONTINUOUS

     The Destroyer's guns hammer away at the Groznyy, at point
     blank range... but the Groznyy IS UNHARMED.  

     Suddenly, in the air above it appear BRILLIANT FLARES.  They
     light up the ship, brighter than the sun.  The destroyer
     isn't firing deadly rounds... it's firing harmless
     starshells.

     INT. FLAG PLOT - THE PENTAGON - CONTINUOUS

     Anderson gets in McNamara's face. 

                    ADMIRAL ANDERSON
          That ship was firing starshells. 
          Starshells.  Flares, Mr. Secretary.

     Everyone's eyes are on the two men.  Only the chatter of
     teletype breaks the paralyzing silence.  McNamara blinks,
     looks down at the plot on the floor.  Anderson's voice drops
     to a deadly sotto.

                    ADMIRAL ANDERSON (CONT'D)
          Goddammitt, I've got a job to do. 
          You've been camped out up there since
          Monday night.  You're exhausted and
          you're making mistakes.  Interfere with
          me, you will get some of killed.  I will
          not allow that.

     McNamara looks away at the faces of the men in the room.

                    MCNAMARA
          Starshells.

                    ADMIRAL ANDERSON
          Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary.  The
          navy has been running blockades since
          the days of John Paul Jones.

     McNamara turns back.  And all trepidation, embarrassment,
     hesitation are gone.  He coldly appraises Anderson.

                    MCNAMARA
          I believe the President made it clear
          that there would be no firing on ships
          without his express permission.  

                    ADMIRAL ANDERSON
          With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we
          were not firing on the ship.  Firing on
          a ship means attacking the ship.  We
          were not attacking the ship.  We were
          firing over it.

                    MCNAMARA
          This was not the President's intention
          when he gave that order.  What if the
          Soviets don't see the distention?  What
          if they make the same mistake I just
          did?
               (beat)
          There will be no firing anything near
          ANY Soviet ships without my express
          permission, is that understood, Admiral?

                    ADMIRAL ANDERSON
          Yes, sir.

                    MCNAMARA
          And I will only issue such instructions
          when ordered to by the President.
               (beat)
          John Paul Jones... you don't understand
          a thing, do you, Admiral?

     He passes his hand over the enormous plot below.

                    MCNAMARA (CONT'D)
          This isn't a blockade.

     McNamara, trembling with anger, awe, whirls to Anderson.  And
     his burgeoning insight is born - clear, hard and cold.

                    MCNAMARA (CONT'D)
          This, all this, is language, a new
          vocabulary the likes of which the world
          has never seen. 
          This is President Kennedy communicating
          with Secretary Khruschev.

     McNamara JABS HIS FINGER OUT AT the plot, and --

     -- the CAMERA RACES DOWN, TRACKING OVER IT, across the vast
     ebb and flow of information, the delicate ballet of symbols
     and numerology, this language of steel and human life.

     INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY

     SUPER: FRIDAY, OCTOBER 26TH.  DAY 11.

     On Kenny's T.V. Walter Cronkite reads the news to footage of
     a BOARDING PARTY going up a ladder to the freighter MARCULA.

                    WALTER CRONKITE (V.O.)
          At 7:29 this morning, the U.S.S. Joseph
          Kennedy stopped and boarded the Soviet
          charter vessel Marcula.

     The Boarding Party wears dress whites and is UNARMED.

                    WALTER CRONKITE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          After a 3-hour inspection, the Kennedy
          signaled no contraband found.  Cleared
          to continue.  Pentagon spokesmen expect
          the next encounter.

     Kenny, who turns from the T.V. as the door to his office
     opens.  Rusk walks in.

                    RUSK
          Kenny, we need to see the President. 
          Something's happened.

     Kenny reacts to Rusk's enigmatic expression.  And out from
     behind Rusk steps JOHN SCALI, the ABC News Correspondent.

     INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY

     OFF THEIR REACTIONS, the CAMERA FINDS an under-strength, ad
     hoc EXCOM - Kenny, Bobby, Taylor, Bundy, Sorensen, McCone,
     Ball and the President.  Guarded hope all around.  The short,
     balding, pugnacious Scali looks discomfited.

                    SCALI
          I have lunch with him maybe once a
          month.  Way he talks, he acts like he
          knows Khruschev personally, but he's
          never elaborated.  I've used him as a
          source in a couple of stories.

     Kenny paces behind the gathered men around the President's
     desk, listening, mind going a million miles an hour.

                    RUSK
          The FBI has identified this Alexander
          Fomin as the Soviet Resident, the KGB
          equivalent of one of our station chiefs. 
          He's their highest ranking spy in this
          country.  And he knows John's a friend
          of mine.

                    BUNDY
          All the trademarks of a back-channel
          overture.

     Kenny eyes Bundy, makes him uncomfortable.  The President
     sizes Scali up.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          So they'll remove the missiles, and
          we'll pledge not to invade Cuba,
          destabilize Castro or assist anyone who
          plans in doing so...

     Nobody dares speak.  It's as if the possibility of a
     settlement will vanish into thin air if anyone moves.

                    BOBBY
          I think... this may be our first real
          message from Khruschev.

                    MCCONE
          The alternative, Mr. President, is that
          this could be a trap.

                    KENNY
          Dangle a settlement, tie us down in
          negotiations, we come up short...

                    MCCONE
          Why else would they approach us in this
          way?  It's deniable.  The Soviets have
          done nothing but lie to us.  This could
          be more of the same.

                    KENNY
          That may be why Khruschev's introducing
          this guy.  We've been burned by his
          usual players in the formal channels, so
          he brings in an honest broker.

                    MCCONE
          That may be what they want us to think.

                    RUSK
          The truth is, Mr. President, we don't
          even really know whom Fomin speaks for. 
          It could be Khruschev. It could be some
          faction in the Politburo or the KGB
          itself.  We just don't know.

                    BOBBY
          By the way, Scali, your activities now
          fall under the secrecy codicils of the
          National Security Act.  Sorry, no
          Pulitzer.

     The gathered men chuckle, only Scali a bit dour but being a
     good sport about it.  Scali checks his watch.

                    SCALI
          Mr. President, we don't have much time. 
          I'm supposed to meet with him again in
          three and a half hours.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Well, it seems the question of the day
          is -- is the offer legitimate?

     He moves away from his desk.  The men watch him.

                    THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
          If it is... if it is, then we can't
          afford to ignore it.
               (beat, to Scali)
          John, we'll have instructions for you in
          a couple of hours.

     Scali nods.  Rusk escorts him out.  They wait until the door
     closes.  Taylor looks over at McCone who nods.

                    GENERAL TAYLOR
          Mr. President, I'm afraid we have some
          bad news.  We're getting GMAIC estimates
          from our latest low-level overflights. 
          It appears the missiles are two to three
          days away from operational status.

                    MCCONE
          So we don't have much time to play out
          back-channel communiques.

     Kenny gives Bobby a hard look.  The President appears
     unfazed.

                    GENERAL TAYLOR
          The quarantine, sir, is not producing
          results.  The Chiefs feel it's time you
          take another look at our options.

     The President considers Taylor, then looks over to Kenny.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Kenny, get over to your old stomping
          grounds.  Go through everything the FBI
          has on Fomin.  I need your best call: is
          this guy legit and is he speaking for
          Khruschev?  And I need you to tell me by
          the time I call you, because right after
          I call you, I'm calling Scali with his
          instructions.

     INT. FBI, COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT FILES - NIGHT

     BANG!  A STACK OF FILES slams down beside Kenny on a large
     paper-covered conference table.  WALTER SHERIDAN, Kenny's
     investigator-buddy, wears a visitor's pass just like Kenny. 
     Kenny and Walter RIFLE through the folders, super fast, super
     proficient.  A half-dozen FBI AGENTS work around the table.

                    SHERIDAN
          Okay.  So, what we've got is this guy
          Alexander Feklisov, aka Alexander Fomin,
          declared Consul to the Soviet Embassy,
          but in reality the KGB Papa Spy.  An
          illustrious tour of duty during the
          Great Patriotic War gets him on the
          Party fast track, various tours of duty
          in KGB, American postings.  He's an
          expert on us, and... that's all we've
          got on Papa Spy.

                    KENNY
          Who's he talking for?  Is it Khruschev,
          or is this more bullshit?

     Kenny stands, runs his hands through his hair, aggravated.

                    KENNY (CONT'D)
          How do you become the KGB top spy in the
          United States?

                    SHERIDAN
          Gotta know someone.

     Kenny whirls on Sheridan.  A frozen beat.

                    KENNY
          Politics is politics.  Walter.
               (whirling on Agents)
          Khruschev is the Moscow Party Boss under
          Stalin.  Give me their career
          chronologies!

     Walter pushes a typed dateline of Khruschev's major career
     moves, and one of the Agents hands Kenny a list of Fomin's
     postings.  He lays them side by side.  And for every step of
     Khruschev's, there's a step for Fomin.  Not only that, but
     the DATES ARE IDENTICAL or nearly so.

                    KENNY (CONT'D)
          Every time Khruschev moves up, Fomin
          does within a year...
               (tracing up the list)
          Khruschev was the administrator in
          charge of preparing Moscow's defenses
          during the war.  And Fomin... was here
          in the U.S.

     Kenny's face falls.  But a YOUNG FBI AGENT cuts in.

                    YOUNG FBI AGENT
          Not at first.

     The Young FBI Agent proffers him a file.  Kenny snatches it.

                    YOUNG FBI AGENT (CONT'D)
          He was an engineer stationed outside
          Moscow in '42.  Specialized in tank
          traps.

     Kenny looks up at Walter.  Walter nods sagely, lights a pipe.

                    KENNY
          They know each other.  They're war
          buddies.

                    SHERIDAN
          It's thin.  But real life usually is.

     A PHONE on the table SHRILLS, shattering the silent triumph.

                    KENNY
          Hello?

                    THE PRESIDENT (O.S.)
          I've got to move.  What do you have,
          Kenny?

                    KENNY
          They know each other!  Khruschev and
          Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!

                    THE PRESIDENT (O.S.)
          You're sure...

                    KENNY
          Don't take it to court, but we've got
          good circumstantial evidence...
               (off Walter's nod)
          Walter agrees.  My gut's telling me
          Khruschev's turning to a trusted old
          friend to carry his message.

                    THE PRESIDENT (O.S.)
          Okay, Ken.  We're going.

     INT. STATLER HOTEL COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

     A few lonely BUSINESS TRAVELERS hang out in the dim coffee
     shop.  Faint music plays.  Scali and ALEXANDER FOMIN sit with
     steaming cups of coffee.  Scali, nervous, unfolds a note. 
     Fomin, an expressionless gray spectre of a man, eyes him.  He
     is, in his boredom, a spy's spy.

                    SCALI
          I am instructed to tell you that the
          American Government would respond
          favorably to an offer along the lines
          you have discussed.  If this solution
          were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador
          Zorin, he would find a favorable reply
          from Ambassador Stevenson.

                    FOMIN
          So I understand you correctly.  If the
          missiles in Cuba were dismantled,
          returned to the Soviet Union, and a
          guarantee was made not to reintroduce
          them, the United States would be
          prepared to guarantee that it would
          never invade Cuba?

                    SCALI
          That is correct.

                    FOMIN
          This is from the Highest Authority?

                    SCALI
          Yes.  From the Highest Authority.  There
          are two conditions.  The U.N.
          must be allowed to inspect the removal
          of the missiles.

                    FOMIN
          And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed
          to observe the redeployment of forces
          from the American Southeast.

     Scali demurs.  He has no instructions on this count.

                    FOMIN (CONT'D)
          And the second condition?

                    SCALI
          Time is of the essence.

     Scali takes a sip of coffee.  Fomin stares at him, intense.

                    FOMIN
          John.  How much time?

                    SCALI
          48 hours.  In 48 hours there can be no
          deals.

     INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

     Scali finishes debriefing the President, Bobby, Kenny,
     McCone, Taylor and Bundy.

                    SCALI
          He left right away.  Got the feeling he
          meant business.

     Kenny and Bobby share a hopeful glance.  Rusk enters from
     Kenny's office.  And he's unable to contain his excitement.

                    RUSK
          Mr. President, we're receiving a letter
          from Khruschev over at State.

     INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - STATE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

     From a cluster of folding metal chairs, Kenny, Bobby, Rusk
     and Sorensen watch a TELETYPE hammer out the message as it
     comes off the wire.  It's painfully slow, like watching a bad
     typist type a manuscript.  Ten pages of this is an eternity. 
     To top it off, it's in Russian.  A TRANSLATOR reads it off,
     word by word to a TRANSCRIBER.

                    TRANSLATOR
          ...two...of...us...pull...on...the...
          knot...of...war...

     INT. CABINET ROOM - NIGHT

     Kenny slams a page of Khruschev's letter on the table.  He
     jabs his finger at it.  EXCOM listens, intent.

                    KENNY
          It's ten pages of sentimental fluff, but
          he's saying right here.  He'll remove
          the missiles in return for a no-invasion
          pledge.  It looks like Fomin's overture
          was genuine.

     The President turns to McCone.

                    MCCONE
          Our early analysis says this was
          probably written by Khruschev himself. 
          It's a first draft, and shows no signs
          of being polished by the foreign
          ministry.  In fact, it probably hasn't
          been approved by the Politburo.  They
          wouldn't have let the emotionalism go
          by.  The analysts say it was written by
          someone under considerable stress.

     EXCOM chuckles.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Glad to hear we're not alone.

     The President eyes the EXCOM members one by one, an incipient
     smile on his face.

                    THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
          Well, gentlemen, I wasn't planning on
          invading Cuba anyway.  I think we can
          live with the terms of this deal.

     There are mostly nods of assent, big smiles around the table. 
     Except from  McCone and Taylor.  The President takes his copy
     of the letter, flips through it.  He shakes his head, almost
     unable to believe that Khruschev has given in.  A long beat.

                    THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
          Ted, I want you to draft our acceptance.

     EXT. O'DONNELL DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

     A long, black car stops at the end of Kenny's driveway.  The
     door opens, and Kenny steps out.  He says an inaudible
     goodnight to the driver, and the car pulls off.  He turns,
     facing the white two-story house with the neat front yard,
     the lights out.  And he smiles.  Home at last.

     EXT. O'DONNELL PATIO - NIGHT

     A screen door squeaks open.  Kenny steps out into the
     darkness of the back yard.  And there, in her robe, sitting
     startled on a lawn chair, lit only by the dim glow of the
     kitchen window, is Helen.  Kenny stands there tired, his coat
     slung over his shoulder.

                    KENNY
          Hi.

     Helen rises, her own care-worn face turned to his.  For a
     silent moment they gaze at each other, searching in the lines
     of each others' face for the changes of a long separation. 
     They see them.  But they've been married a long time, and the
     awkwardness passes.

                    HELEN
          Hi, O'Donnell.  You look old.

     Kenny drops his coat on a table as Helen comes up and folds
     herself into his arms.

                    HELEN (CONT'D)
          This job's going to kill you.  If I
          don't first.

     They kiss, comfortable.  But not too long, and he lets her
     go.  She looks at him again, sees he's suppressing a smile.

                    HELEN (CONT'D)
          If you're home it means either Jack and
          Bobby have finally figured out what a
          con man you are and fired you, or --

                    KENNY
          -- we got a back channel communication
          from Khruschev this evening feeling us
          out about a deal.  He confirmed it just
          a little while ago in a letter to the
          President.  I think we've won.

                    HELEN
          A thing like this... who could even
          think of winning?

     INT. HALL OUTSIDE KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY

     SUPER: SATURDAY, OCTOBER 27TH.  DAY 12.

     Kenny, in his overcoat, steps aside as a pair of Duty
     Officers race past him, almost bowling him over. 
     He slows as he nears the doors to his office and the Oval
     Office, DISCOVERING:

     TOTAL CHAOS.  EXCOM guys, Assistants, dart to and from the
     offices and halls.  On all their faces grim expressions. 
     Kenny stands there a beat in confusion.  And then Bobby
     swings out of Kenny's office.  There's a desperate edge to
     Bobby's voice.

                    BOBBY
          Where've you been?  We've been trying to
          find you all morning.

                    KENNY
          Helen and I went out for breakfast.
          EXCOM's not supposed to convene til
          eight.

                    BOBBY
          We just got a second letter from
          Khruschev.  The deal's off.

          INT. HALL OUTSIDE CABINET ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Kenny and Bobby walk fast for the cabinet room, Kenny still
     in his coat.

                    BOBBY
          We're getting everyone together as fast
          as we can.

                    KENNY
          What does the letter say?

                    BOBBY
          They want us to take our missiles out of
          Turkey along with the no invasion
          pledge.  It looks like Fomin was a ploy
          after all, and they were just stalling
          for time.

     Kenny is stunned.

                    BOBBY (CONT'D)
          It gets worse.

     Kenny gives Bobby a sharp look as they enter --

     INT. CABINET ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     The President, in shirtsleeves, no tie, glances up at Kenny
     as he and Bobby enter.  Kenny can only bear his look for a
     second: he blew the call on Fomin.  But the President is
     clearly relieved to see him, gives him a faint smile. 
     Half of EXCOM, including McNamara, McCone, Rusk, and Taylor
     barely notice them as they're already there arguing.

     Kenny sits down hurriedly, shucks off his coat as he joins
     the conversation in mid-stream.

                    MCCONE
          My specialists are in agreement: this
          morning's letter is not Khruschev.  Last
          night's letter was.
               (beat)
          The evidence supports only one
          conclusion: there has been a coup, and
          Khruschev was replaced overnight.

                    KENNY
          Jesus Christ...

     Bobby gives him a look: told you things got worse.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Dean?

                    RUSK
          It doesn't necessarily mean there's been
          a coup.  Khruschev's name is signed to
          the letter.

                    MCNAMARA
          Aw, come on, Dean!

                    RUSK
          But at the very least... It does suggest
          he's been co-opted by hard line
          elements.

                    MCNAMARA
          Which at the end of the day is the same
          thing as a coup.  A puppet Khruschev,
          and a hard-line Soviet government
          pulling the strings.  No deal.  And the
          missiles are almost operational.

     Bitter silence.  They all look to the President.  Imminent
     victory has turned to ashes.  The President studies his own
     folded hands.  Ball and Thompson enter, take seats.  One by
     one, throughout the scene, other EXCOM members join the
     group.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          You know, the problem we have is that
          this is latest offer of theirs will seem
          reasonable to everyone.  We remove our
          missiles, they remove theirs. 
          Our Jupiters were scheduled for removal
          anyway.  They're obsolete, after all.

     Kenny shakes his head in mute anger.  McNamara and Rusk seem
     to sense the President's feelings, too.

                    RUSK
          Mr. President, agreeing to such a trade
          would be tantamount to paying ransom. 
          They'll put a gun to our head again, and
          expect us to pay again.

     Kenny looks the President in the eye.

                    KENNY
          We can't sell out one of our friends for
          our own safety.  NATO wouldn't trust us
          anymore, and they'd be right not to.

     The President sighs in the face of the stern advice.  He
     nods, expecting as much.  Bobby still can't look at anyone.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          So which one of you geniuses can tell me
          how to explain ourselves to the world? 
          How do we work with them if there's been
          a hard-line coup?

                    GENERAL TAYLOR
          Mr. President, there is another
          possibility we haven't considered.  This
          may not be a coup at all.

     Everyone of Kenny's instincts jumps.  His head snaps up to
     listen to Taylor.  Taylor pauses.

                    GENERAL TAYLOR (CONT'D)
          It's possible that the back-channel
          overture, last night's letter, and this
          letter today, along with everything the
          Soviets have said all along, is nothing
          more than a lie -- disinformation.

                    MCNAMARA
          Designed to keep us from taking action.

     Kenny hears the fatalism in McNamara's voice.  A long beat. 
     Everyone stares at McNamara.

                    MCNAMARA (CONT'D)
          I hate to say it, but if I had to bet,
          I'd bet Max is right.  What if they have
          no intention of honoring this deal,
          either? 
          Then tomorrow they add another
          condition.  Meanwhile, the quarantine
          isn't working and they're continuing to
          work on the missile sites.
               (beat)
          I think we have to consider issuing
          warning orders for our forces.

     They were so close last night... and suddenly Lundahl and
     LeMay enter the room with the day's briefing boards.

                    LUNDAHL
          Mr. President...

     Lundahl stands there at the end of the table, gray.  He
     almost can't say it, can't look the President in the face.

                    LUNDAHL (CONT'D)
          This morning's photography is in.  It
          appears the Soviets have commenced a
          crash program to ready the missiles.

                                   SMASH CUT TO:

     EXT. MISSILE SITE - CUBA - CONTINUOUS

     The missiles site is now more than just dirt and clearing
     equipment.  It's an armed camp, with missiles, fuel trailers,
     erectors spaced every few hundred yards.  MISSILE TECHNICIANS
     service the towering SS-4s.

                    LUNDAHL (V.O.)
          The first missiles became operational
          last night.

     With a barrage of shouted orders in Russian, and a whine of
     the ERECTOR's engines, THE MISSILE BEGINS TO RISE.

                    LUNDAHL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          We expect they'll all be operational in
          36 hours: Monday morning.

     It stops, vertical.

                                   SMASH CUT TO:

     INT. CABINET ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     The news hits the room like a thunderbolt.  Kenny looks to
     Bobby and the President.  The blood is gone from their faces.

                    MCNAMARA
          Then we're out of time.  We have to go
          in.

                    LUNDAHL
          That may not be as easy as we thought
          either.  We've gotten confirmation that
          the Soviets have also deployed
          battlefield nuclear weapons to Cuba. 

     A pall falls over the room as LeMay explains.

                    LEMAY
          FROGS, we call 'em.  Short range
          tactical nukes.  It's possible they've
          delegated release authority to their
          local commanders for use against our
          invasion troops.  It'd be standard
          doctrine.
               (beat)
          Our capability to get all the missiles
          has eroded during our delay with the
          quarantine.  The good news is that for
          the moment we know where the FROGS are,
          and we can target them, too.  But the
          longer we wait, the hard it's going to
          get.

     They all look to the President.  Kenny stares, in a private
     hell, blacker and more complete than anyone should ever know.

     In that shocked silence each man grapples with failure.  The
     Best and the Brightest could not prevent what must come next.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Then we have no choice.
               (to  Taylor)
          General, issue the warning orders to our
          forces.  They will be prepared to
          execute the air strikes Monday morning
          and the follow-on invasion according to
          the schedule thereafter.  I'll need the
          official release orders on my desk
          Sunday night.

                    GENERAL TAYLOR
          Understood, sir.  We need to step up the
          overflights, finalize our pilots' target
          folders in order to be able to carry out
          the strikes.

     The President gives Kenny a meaningful look.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Permission granted.

     Taylor exits.  Kenny rises, gives the President an almost
     imperceptible nod, as he prepares to leave in Taylor's wake.

                    THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
          Gentlemen, if anybody's got any great
          ideas, now's the time...

     INT. READY ROOM - MACDILL AFB - DAY

     MAJOR RUDOLPH ANDERSON, 30, wearing the bulky high-altitude
     pressure suit of a U-2 pilot, takes the phone from one of the
     Air Force NCOs who are helping him suit up.

                    MAJOR ANDERSON
          This is Major Anderson.

                                   INTERCUT CALL TO:

     INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     Kenny, at the other end of the line, stares out the window at
     the fall day.  It seems so mild, so unlike war.  And it takes
     him a beat before he realizes Anderson's on the line.

                    MAJOR ANDERSON (O.S.)
          Hello?  Anyone there?

                    KENNY
          Major, my name is Kenneth O'Donnell. 
          Special Assistant to the President.

     Kenny takes a breath, ready to start the shuck-and-jive...
     but for some reason doesn't.

                    KENNY (CONT'D)
          Major, a few days ago the President
          ordered me to help him keep control of
          what's going on out there.  I've been
          browbeating pilots, navy guys left and
          right to make sure you don't get us here
          in Washington into trouble.  But you
          know what?  We're pretty damn good at
          getting ourselves into trouble.  So
          instead of riding your ass, I'm just
          going to tell you what's going on, and
          let you figure out how best to help us
          out up here.

     INT. READY ROOM - MACDILL AFB - CONTINUOUS

     Now mostly suited up, Major Anderson takes the phone out of
     the NCO's hand.  He nods, serious.

                    MAJOR ANDERSON
          Go ahead, sir.

     INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                    KENNY
          Last night, we looked like we were going
          to cut a deal to get us all out of this
          mess.  Today, the Soviets are reneging. 
          We're going to try to salvage the
          situation, but a lot of things are going
          wrong today.  It's making everyone
          nervous, and it will be very hard to
          avoid going to war.  Don't get shot
          down, Major.  Beyond that, whatever else
          you can do to help us, I'd really
          appreciate it.

     INT. READY ROOM - MACDILL AFB - CONTINUOUS

     Major Anderson waves his NCOs away.  They leave the room. 
     The Major sits on a bench in front of his locker, thinks.

                    MAJOR ANDERSON
          When you're up there at 72,000 feet,
          there's a million things that can go
          wrong.  Is your oxygen mix right?  Will
          your cameras freeze up?  Are you leaving
          contrail...
               (beat)
          Those million things are beyond your
          control, mostly... But you know, when
          you realize that, there's a kind of
          peace.  You don't need to be in control. 
          You never were in control in the first
          place.  If you're a good man, and your
          ground crew are good men, it's all you
          can ask for.  And with the grace of G-d,
          it'll get you through.

     The young Major smiles to himself, to the phone.

                    MAJOR ANDERSON (CONT'D)
          You sound like a good man.  You'll be
          all right, Mr. O'Donnell.  We believe in
          you guys down here.
               (beat)
          Thanks for the call.

     INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     Kenny nods to himself, deeply touched by the man's faith.

                    KENNY
          Thank you, Major.

     INT. READY ROOM - MACDILL AFB - CONTINUOUS

     With a click, the line goes dead and Anderson walks the phone
     over to the receiver on the wall.

     END INTERCUT

     EXT. RUNWAY - MACDILL AFB - MOMENTS LATER

     A cart speeds down the tarmac, an NCO behind the wheel. 
     Beside him sits Major Anderson, his helmet on, visor up.  He
     adjusts the mix on the oxygen bottle he's carrying at his
     feet, breathing in preparation for the high-altitude flight. 
     Up ahead, among a host of service vehicles, sits the U-2.

     INT. U-2 - DAY

     Anderson switches over to the U-2's oxygen supply as his NCOs
     belt him in.  They slap him on the helmet for good luck and
     lower the canopy as he brings his engines up to power.

                    MAJOR ANDERSON
          This is flight G3132, requesting
          permission for take-off.

                    TOWER VOICE (O.S.)
          G3132, you've got runway one, you are
          cleared to proceed to Angels 72.

                    MAJOR ANDERSON
          Roger that.

     And he throws the throttle forward, 

                                   SMASH CUT TO:

     EXT. STRATOSPHERE - MOMENTS LATER

     The twilight, in-between, world of the stratosphere.  Far
     below -- clouds, shining blue day.  Above, stars and the
     indigo depths of space.  We hang in utter silence.

     A silver glint appears in the center of the horizon.  It
     grows larger.  Then larger still.  It is the U-2.  We barely
     have time to register the rising hiss of its engines, when it
     FILLS THE SCREEN and BOOMS PAST, leaving us standing still.

     The CAMERA PANS to follow it, but it's already dwindled to a
     speck, and we feel how fast 600 miles an hour really is.

     INT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS

     Anderson's gloved hand reaches for the CAMERA HEATER
     switches.

     EXT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS

     The belly door whines open like a silver eyelid, exposing the
     camera's lense.

     INT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS

     Anderson double checks his position, switches to the
     autopilot for the stability only the machine can provide,
     then hits the CAMERA ACTIVATE button on his joystick. 
     BAMABMABMABMA... The camera begins its photography.

     Anderson watches the number on the film-remaining counter
     spool down.  He stares out the window.  The towering clouds
     below rise up magnificent, glorious... a glimpse of heaven.

     Rapt,  Anderson stares.  And then suddenly a BLARING ALARM
     GOES OFF IN THE COCKPIT.  It shocks Anderson around to the
     controls.  It's his MISSILE WARNING LIGHT.

     Anderson' hands flash out to the joystick, turning off the
     cameras, disabling autopilot.  He banks the U-2 hard.

     EXT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS

     As the U-2 turns, far, far below, emerging from the clouds,
     barely visible, rises a CONTRAIL.  It arcs lazily toward us. 
     A beat, and then another CONTRAIL.  

     Then ANOTHER.  The anti-aircraft missiles creating them are
     too small to be seen with the naked eye.

     INT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS

     The cockpit is a cacophony of alarms and lights, the horizon
     outside tilted.  Anderson's breath comes fast, rasping as he
     does his strains going into the high-g turn.

     He looks out the cockpit window, finds the first SA-2 missile
     in pursuit only several thousand feet below him now.  He
     waits. Waits.  Waits, still in the turn.  The black head of
     the missile now visible.

     He puts the plane over, rolling out into an opposite bank.

     EXT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS

     The spy plane's long flimsy wings weren't made for
     dogfighting.  They BEND terribly in the rollout.  And then
     the first missile STREAKS past, tries to correct its miss,
     but can't and vanishes into the distance at a 90-degree
     angle.

     INT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS

     Anderson's breath comes faster and faster as the second
     missile rises up, now visible.  He puts the throttle as far
     as it goes, trying to outrun death.  Every second is a tenth
     of a mile, and every mile shortens the missile's life span.

     The rising missile drafts aft, closing on the U-2 from
     behind.

     EXT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS

     The second missile's contrail rises up behind the plane,
     levels off, and closes on it at a tremendous rate.

     The third missile rises up in the far distance behind the
     second.

     The second missile races up on the U-2, closer, right behind
     it, can't miss.  Then at a hundred yards, the contrail
     suddenly peters out, and the missile, out of fuel, drops
     away.

     But the third missile closes.

     INT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS

     Anderson glances out the window, sees the spent missiles fall
     away, and spots the third missile still seeking him aft. 
     Hand pinning the throttle forward, he prays under his breath.

     EXT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS

     The third SA-2 rides its billowing column of exhaust straight
     for the tail of the U-2.  This one is not out of fuel.

     INT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS

     Major Anderson opens his eyes.  He stares out the window at
     the glorious wonder of cloud and sea and earth below.

     EXT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS

     And the missile looms.  We have time to realize it's almost
     as big as the plane itself before it SHEARS right into the U
     2's tail and EXPLODES in a BLINDING FLASH.

     INT. HALL OUTSIDE BUNDY'S OFFICE - DAY

     Kenny, jogging down the hall, hears form an open door.

                    BUNDY (O.S.)
          Kenny!

     Kenny goes over to the threshold.  Inside the office Bundy
     stands up from behind his desk, grave.  And Kenny knows.

     INT. CABINET ROOM - DAY

     All of EXCOM is there except for Bundy.  Kenny sits behind
     the President, deeply distraught over Major Anderson.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Does this attack on our plane represent
          a definitive, intentional escalation on
          the part of the Soviets?

                    GENERAL TAYLOR
          The Soviets are in control of the SAMs. 
          It's hard to believe with their
          centralized command structure that it
          could be an accidental launch.

                    MCCONE
          Mr. President, taken with the events of
          the past few hours, I believe this
          confirms our worst fears.  We're now
          dealing with a hard-line Soviet
          government, perhaps with Khruschev as a
          puppet head, perhaps not.

     In the silence, Kenny reads the faces around the room. 
     They're convinced by McCone's pronouncement.  Kenny's not.

                    KENNY
          It could be a mistake.

     McCone gives him a get-serious look.  But Kenny presses on.

                    KENNY (CONT'D)
          We need to be positive before we react.

     Bundy enters the room.  Everyone looks up.  He stands there
     in the doorway, his face tight.

     Kenny sags in his chair.  Bundy, of course, has more bad
     news, and they all know it.  A hopeless beat.  The President
     just stares at Bundy, unable to ask.  Bundy nods, affirming
     what everyone is thinking.

                    BUNDY
          A U-2 on a routine air-sampling mission
          over Siberia got lost and penetrated
          Soviet airspace.  The Soviets scrambled
          MIGs in pursuit, thinking it was a
          bomber.  It got out okay.  Somebody
          forgot to cancel the mission.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Goddammitt.  There's always some
          sonofabitch who doesn't get the word. 
          All we need is the Soviets thinking
          we're bombing them.
               (facetious)
          Anybody else?

     The humor falls on a cold audience.

                    GENERAL TAYLOR
          Mr. President, our pilots are in danger. 
          We must order punitive airstrikes
          against the SAM site that shot down
          Major Anderson per our rules of
          engagement.

     And finally the moment Kenny has dreaded all this time has
     come to pass.  He looks at Bobby, then at the President.  The
     President stares at the cup of coffee in his hands, as if
     trying to read the Fates' design in it.  A long beat, and
     everyone holds their breath.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          No.  I want confirmation there wasn't
          some sort of accident first.

     LeMay clears his throat.  Everyone looks at him, expecting
     him to scream or jump up and down.

                    LEMAY
          I think that's a good idea, Mr.
          President.  It'll be safer for my boys
          to get those SAMs on Monday when we get
          the rest of the bastards.  I can wait a
          day and a half.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Very well, then.

     But he says it without any belief in the words, realizing
     they're being tied fast to the train tracks of war.

     INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY

     Alone in his office, shattered, Kenny stares out the window,
     viewing the distant Ellipse through a gap in the trees.  Kids
     are out there playing football.  He glances at his watch, and
     grabs his jacket.

     EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

     Kenny puts on his jacket as he goes down the steps into the
     bright autumn day, walking away from the White House.  It
     drops behind him -- his step is faster, more urgent.

     EXT. STREET - DAY

     Kenny walks down the sidewalk, drawn toward the Ellipse.  The
     sixth grade FOOTBALL PLAYERS sweep forward with a running
     play.  Kenny scans them, searching, his breath coming hard.

     EXT. ELLIPSE - DAY

     He reaches the edge of the open field.  And then he spots the
     name on the jersey: O'Donnell.  It's Kevin. The players
     relinquish the ball and the offense comes off the field. 
     Kevin sees his dad.

                    KEVIN
          Hey!  Dad!

     Kenny manages a smile as Kevin trots over.  Kevin pulls his
     helmet off.  They stand there a long beat, Kenny desperate to
     take him up, abandon his post... but he doesn't.

                    KENNY
          Hey, sport.  You winning?

                    KEVIN
          Yeah.

     But Kevin sees the turmoil in his father's face.

                    KEVIN (CONT'D)
          Is everything going to be okay, Dad?

     Kenny's forced smile is answer enough.

                    KENNY
          Yeah, Kev.  Everything's gonna be fine.

     But Kevin knows.  Together they know.  The end of the world
     is at hand.

                    KEVIN
          I guess you won't be coming home
          tonight.

                    KENNY
          I, uh...

     Suddenly a car HONKS.  Kenny turns around.  Bobby is leaning
     out the rear passenger window of his limo.  And he sees what
     Kenny is doing.  He doesn't want to cut in, but has to.

                    BOBBY
          Kenny!  We need to talk.

     Kenny looks back at his son.

                    KENNY
          Get back out there, kid.  Remember to
          hit 'em hard.

                    KEVIN
          What about you?  Where are you going?

                    KENNY
          Back to work.

     Kevin puts his helmet back on his head.  Kenny watches as
     Kevin jogs off to rejoin his team.  Kenny turns his back on
     his son, and strides for Bobby's limo, dying inside.

     EXT. SANS SOUCI PARKING LOT - DAY

     Kenny and Bobby stand by their car off to one side of the
     restaurant's parking lot.  Bobby's Secret Service Agents
     maintain a discreet distance.

                    KENNY
          If we're going to make a deal, we're
          going to have to do it fast.  This is
          only getting out of control.  The only
          reason we're not at war this very minute
          is he's been able to stretch, bend and
          break his own rules.  He won't be able
          to keep it up forever.

     Bobby jams the last bit of sandwich in his mouth.  A beat. 
     Kenny looks him in the eye.

                    BOBBY
          And?

                    KENNY
          And Jack wants to trade the missiles in
          Turkey.

                    BOBBY
          The Jupiters are obsolete.  They were
          supposed to have been dismantled last
          summer anyway --

                    KENNY
          -- Jesus, Mary and Joseph.  I told you
          how stupid it was to float the Lippman
          article!  But you wouldn't listen to me. 
          What if there hasn't been a coup at all? 
          What if it's you two who invited that
          second letter by raising the possibility
          of a trade?

     Bobby is speechless with rage.

                    KENNY (CONT'D)
          And if the two of you are thinking this
          trade is your ace in the hole, you're so
          wrong.  It's a deuce.

     Bobby's beyond furious.  They catch their rising voices.

                    KENNY (CONT'D)
          And it's not just me who thinks that. 
          Everyone on this so-called EXCOM is
          telling you exactly the same thing: make
          the trade, and they're going to force us
          into trade after trade until finally
          they demand something we won't trade
          like Berlin, and we do end up in a war.
               (beat)
          Not to mention, that long before that
          happens, this government will be
          politically dead.

     Bobby simmers for a long beat, thinking.  And boy, does this
     guy hate admitting he's wrong.

                    BOBBY
          All right, so maybe we overestimated how
          reasonable this trade would look.  Okay? 
          You happy?  So now what?

                    KENNY
          So now you've got to talk him out of it. 
          And then we've got to figure out an
          acceptable political solution.

                    BOBBY
          And if there has been a coup and there
          is no acceptable political solution?

     Kenny stares off at the city, agonized.

     INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

     Kenny enters from his office, finding Bobby, Rusk and
     Sorensen talking with the President.  The President gives him
     a brief, meaningful look.

                    RUSK
          Whatever response we send, it will take
          several hours for the wire to be
          received by our embassy and delivered to
          the Kremlin.  So we're looking at early
          tomorrow morning at the earliest before
          Khruschev could respond.

     As Rusk talks, Kenny passes close by Bobby.  Bobby whispers:

                    BOBBY
          He gets it, but he's pissed.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          That's all well and good, but what do we
          say to 'em?

                    SORENSEN
          It depends on if we really believe
          there's been a coup.

     That strikes a cord with Kenny.

                    KENNY
          I agree.  If there has been a coup, and
          there's a hard-line government in power
          now, then it doesn't matter what we say. 
          The end of the day we'll either agree to
          their terms, they'll agree to ours, or
          we'll go to war.  But what if there
          hasn't been a coup?  What if... what if
          what is happening is a series of
          accidents?

                    SORENSEN
          The second letter is an accident?

                    KENNY
          No.  The letter is an intentional, but
          it's having an effect far greater than
          its authors intended.
               (beat)
          What if our Jupiter missiles are just a
          last minute haggle to salvage something? 
          Maybe a bone Khruschev is throwing to
          the hard line, not really caring if we
          reject it or not?
               (beat)
          And then these accidents have happened.

                    BOBBY
          Making the second letter and the overall
          picture look worse than it really is.

                    SORENSEN
          The Guns of August.

                    KENNY
          Exactly.
               (beat)
          If they're sane and human like we are,
          then maybe we just refuse, and they'll
          let it slide, like we've been letting
          things slide.

                    SORENSEN
          So we reject the second letter.

     And Kenny looks at Bobby.  The world stops.

                    KENNY
          No.  We don't reject it...

     It hits Bobby like a lightning bolt.

                    BOBBY
          ... We accept the first letter and
          pretend the second doesn't exist.

     The President, Rusk and Sorensen stare at him, mute.

          INT. CABINET ROOM - NIGHT

     HOLD ON the exact same mute reaction from the entire
     assembled EXCOM.  Finally McCone breaks the spell.

                    MCCONE
          It won't work --

     Bobby, Kenny and Sorensen start to object, but McCone raises
     his voice over theirs.

                    MCCONE (CONT'D)
          -- because it's wishful thinking!  It's
          the same wishful thinking that blinded
          us all these months while the Soviets
          were sneaking those missiles in under
          our noses!

     McNamara shakes his head, intrigued but skeptical.

                    MCNAMARA
          Ignore the second letter, agree to the
          conditions of the first...

                    GENERAL TAYLOR
          There's no reason to believe the Soviets
          will let it go.

                    RUSK
          Max is right.  Why will they accept it?

                    MCNAMARA
          It can work.  If, IF they believe we'll
          hit them.

     Kenny, Bobby and Sorensen look at McNamara, grateful.

                    MCNAMARA (CONT'D)
          We've only got time for one more round
          of diplomacy.  The first airstrikes
          start in less than 36 hours.

                    RUSK
          But we have to make them agree to it. 
          So how do we do that?

     The President leans forward.  Sensing he's about to speak,
     all eyes turn to him.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          We give them something.  We tell them
          we'll remove the missiles from Turkey
          say, six months from now so that there
          appears to be no linkage.  We also tell
          them if they go public about it, we deny
          it and the deal is off.

                    KENNY
          And we do it under the table so we can
          disavow any knowledge of it.

                    MCCONE
          It's transparent.  The press'll be all
          over it.

                    KENNY
          Six months from now, I'm not going to
          care.  Are you?  We'll deal with it.

                    MCNAMARA
          At least it will expose whether
          Khruschev has been overthrown.  We'll
          know what we're dealing with.

                    KENNY
          And if this is a move to appease the
          hard line, then it may just be the bone
          he needs to regain control of his own
          house.

     Most EXCOM is nodding, agreeing.  McCone shakes his head in
     disgust.  Taylor sits in silence.

                    RUSK
          Whoever carries the message has to hit
          the nail on the head.  Come across as
          too soft, they'll push us.  Too hard,
          they'll be cornered and even more
          dangerous.

                    MCCONE
          They could pre-empt.

     It's a terrible responsibility to bear.  The room is silent. 
     At last Bobby looks up from his folded hands to his brother. 
     The President stares back.  There is nobody else who can do
     this.  Only Bobby. His brother.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Bobby.  You know Dobrynin best.

     Bobby nods, taking up the gauntlet.

                    THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
          Ted, you get working on the draft.

     Sorensen and Bobby rise as one, head for the doors.

                    THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
          And make sure he knows we have to have
          an answer tomorrow.
               (beat, final)
          Because on Monday we begin military
          action against Cuba.

     Bobby and Kenny exchange a look.

     EXT. WEST WING DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

     A LONG SHOT: Bobby emerges from the West Wing in his
     overcoat, briefcase in hand.  He pauses, tiny, alone.  The
     West Wing - and all its imposing spotlit power behind him -
     reduced to this insignificant man on his eleventh-hour
     mission.

     And then, out of the shadows, in the f.g., steps Kenny in his
     own coat, his breath frosting in the late-night air.  Bobby
     sees him, and knows he is not so alone anymore.

     ON THE DRIVEWAY

     They meet in front of the limo.  Bobby stops, shuffles his
     things, awkward.

                    BOBBY
          What do you want?  A good-bye kiss?

     Kenny opens the driver's side door.  The Secret Service LIMO
     DRIVER peers out.

                    LIMO DRIVER
          Hey, Kenny.

                    KENNY
          Hey, Joe.  Listen, I'll take care of
          him.  Go ahead in, grab some coffee. 
          We'll be back pretty quick.

                    LIMO DRIVER
          You sure?

     Kenny's nod and look -- there's no arguing.  The Limo Driver
     hops out, and Kenny gets in.  Bobby stands there outside for
     a beat.  He tries to hide how touched he is, but can't
     completely.

                    KENNY
          What's the matter with you?  Forget how
          to open a car door?

     INT. BOBBY'S LIMO - NIGHT

     Bobby recovers, opens his own door, gets in the front seat
     next to Kenny.

                    KENNY
          Jesus, you rich people.

     Kenny starts up the engine.  Bobby smiles a twisted smile. 
     As the car pulls away, the two men sit in silence, neither
     willing to admit how glad the other is there.

     EXT. PENNSYLVANIA AVE. - NIGHT

     The limo wheels out into the street, carrying the two friends
     into the darkness.

     INT. BOBBY'S LIMO - NIGHT

     Bobby stares out the window at the passing city, the lights
     the lives behind those windows.  As the car drives on and on,
     the tension returns.  Bobby feels the weight of all those
     lives.  On him.  A long beat.  He gazes at Kenny, the only
     man he could ever admit this to:

                    BOBBY
          I don't know if I can do this.

     Kenny glances over at him.  Bobby stares back.

                    KENNY
          There's nobody else I'd rather have
          going in there.

     Bobby looks at him.

                    KENNY (CONT'D)
          Nobody else I'd trust Helen and the
          kids' lives to.

     Kenny means it.  He looks away.  Bobby shifts, awkward.

                    BOBBY
          Take a left.

     Kenny looks him.  This isn't the way to the Justice
     Department.  But he complies.

                    BOBBY (CONT'D)
          We gave so much to get here.  I don't
          know.  Sometimes I think what the hell
          did we do it for?

                    KENNY
          Because we knew we could do a better job
          than everyone else.

     And Bobby, in the silence and closeness of the car, turns on
     Kenny - anguished, knowing his life is at its climax.

                    BOBBY
          You know... I hate being called the
          brilliant one.  The ruthless one.  They
          guy who does the dirty work.  The one
          everybody's afraid of.  

     Kenny looks to him, moved, not knowing what to say.

                    BOBBY (CONT'D)
          I hate it.  I'm not smart, you know. 
          And I'm not so ruthless.

     He looks to Kenny, searching his face, then away,
     embarrassed.

                    KENNY
          You're right about the smart part, but
          ruthless, well...

     That breaks the tension as they arrive at the scene:

     THROUGH THE WINDOW

     Appears the grim, square lines of the SOVIET EMBASSY.  Police
     cars line the streets outside it.  All the windows are dark. 
     A cordon of KGB GUARDS in plainclothes stand by the gated
     entrance.  On the opposite side of the street lounge two
     dozen WASHINGTON D.C. POLICE.

     RESUME

     Kenny gives Bobby a look.  Bobby rolls down his window.

                    BOBBY
          Slow down.  Smell that?

                    KENNY
          Smoke.

                    BOBBY
          Just wanted to see for myself.
               (beat)
          They're burning their documents.

     The final duty of an embassy before war...

                    BOBBY (CONT'D)
          They think we're going to war.  G-d help
          us, Ken.

     EXT. SOVIET EMBASSY - NIGHT

     THE CAMERA lifts away from the limo, turning toward the
     Embassy, past the Guards, past the brass plate which reads
     EMBASSY OF THE UNITED SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS, up and up
     to the roof where black, reeking SMOKE billows from all of
     the Embassy's several chimneys.

     The CAMERA races into it.  It engulfs us all.

     EXT. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

     Kenny squeals the limo up to the curb in front of the Justice
     Department.  The doors fly open, and Kenny and Bobby jump
     out, head up the steps to the building.

     INT. HALL OUTSIDE BOBBY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Bobby's STAFFERS greet them as they stride down the hall,
     Staffer #1 taking Bobby's coat.

                    STAFFER #1
          Sir, Ambassador Dobrynin is already
          here.  We have him waiting in your
          office.

     They reach the double oak doors to Bobby's suite and stop. 
     Bobby faces Kenny.

                    KENNY
          I'll whistle up some luck for you.

     And before Kenny's eyes, all of Bobby's doubt vanishes.  In
     its place, a severe confidence.  A grandeur Kenny has never
     seen.

     It makes Kenny pause.  He beholds his best friend become a
     man of the ages.  And then Bobby SMOOTHLY opens the door.

     INT. BOBBY'S WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

     And a DOOR SHUTS OC like a threshold of history.  HOLD ON
     Bobby's waiting room.  Silent.  Cavernous.  Dim.  Plush
     carpet.  Heavy drapes framing dark windows.  And abandoned
     secretary's desk.  A row of sofas and chairs on either side
     of the room.  Two doorways, one at either end of the room.

     A WOMAN sits in one of the chairs for visitors.  Dressed in
     gray.  Prim.  But beautiful.  A secretary of some sort.

     One of the double doors to the hall swings silently open. 
     Kenny glides in.  He sees the other door shut at the far end
     of the room.  Kenny crashes in one of the chairs to wait.

     HOLD ON THE SCENE, motionless, silent.

     Kenny WHISTLES two notes.  Stops.  And then he begins to
     WHISTLE the Irish tune, O'Donnell Aboo.  He gets a bar into
     it -- and there's a polite, soft COUGH.

     Kenny stops.  Then notices the Woman in gray across the room. 
     He didn't see her.  It's dim over there.  She looks at him,
     expressionless.

     The CAMERA FINDS: a pin on her lapel.  A RED HAMMER AND
     SICKLE.

     Kenny reacts.  Dobrynin's assistant?  His opposite number?  A
     friend?  Or more than a friend?

     Here is the face of the enemy.  Not a smile between them. 
     Kenny resumes his ease.  And begins to WHISTLE again.

     The haunting Irish song echoes in the vaulted ceiling,
     filling the dim room.  Strange, sad, beautiful.  The woman
     listens.  And her face begins to soften.  

     Kenny stares at the dark, lonely windows, his SONG striving
     to fill the empty room.

     Kenny sinks deeper in the chair, his tune all-consuming...
     and the Woman's voice breaks in.  Kenny stops, looks over. 
     Her voice is tremulous and beautiful.  Just a snatch of some
     song in Russian.  She stops, awkward.

     Kenny stares.  The Woman stares back.  No smiles.  But in
     their eyes, they each see the other's fear, the other's
     beauty, the other's humanity.

     So this is the enemy.

                    THE WOMAN
          Who are you?

     Kenny glances to the door.  He considers for a long moment.

                    KENNY
          The friend.

     Kenny breaks the gaze.  He begins to whistle again.  The
     CAMERA drifts away, finding the far DOOR to the inner office,
     Kenny's tune stronger, carrying with it hope...

     INT. BOBBY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     ... to the other side of that DOOR.  Dobrynin sits in a chair
     opposite Bobby behind his desk.  The room is equally dim. 
     And far more tense.

     Silence.  And then the FAINTEST STRAIN of O'Donnell Aboo. 
     Dobrynin glances briefly over his shoulder at the door.

     But Bobby, unseen by Dobrynin, can't help the flicker of a
     private smile.  It's Kenny's presence, and Bobby is the
     stronger for it.  And then the tune is gone.

     Bobby leans forward, cool, controlled, masterful.

                    BOBBY
          Ambassador Dobrynin, we are aware that
          at this moment your missiles in Cuba are
          at the brink of operational readiness...

                                   SMASH CUT TO:

     EXT. MISSILE SITE - CUBA - CONTINUOUS

     Floodlights illuminate MISSILES, vertical on their erectors,
     support VEHICLES, clustered across the man-made clearing.

     Mask-wearing Technicians wave a FUEL TRUCK back to the
     nearest missile.  Clouds of toxic VAPOR rise from the others. 
     They've already been fueled.

                    BOBBY (V.O.)
          They are a vital threat to my country. 
          If launched, they would kill 80 million
          Americans.

                                   SMASH CUT TO:

     INT. BOBBY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     Dobrynin listens impassively, as is his professional duty.

                    BOBBY
          My brother, my friends, my countrymen
          and I cannot and will not permit those
          missiles to become operational.
               (beat)
          I promise you that.

     Dobrynin looks out the window.  And then, pained, looks back
     at Bobby.

                    DOBRYNIN
          Then I fear our two nations will go to
          war.  And I fear where war will lead us.

     Bobby acknowledges him with a nod.

                    BOBBY
          If the missiles do not become
          operational, if you remove the missiles,
          then there will be no war.
               (beat)
          At this moment, the President is
          accepting the terms of Secretary
          Khruschev's letter of Friday night.  If
          the Soviet Union halts construction
          immediately, removes the missiles, and
          submits to U.N. inspection, the United
          States will pledge to never invade Cuba
          or aid others in that enterprise.

     Dobrynin stares at Bobby.  Stares hard.

                    DOBRYNIN
          If your Jupiter missiles in Turkey were
          removed also, such an accommodation
          could be reached.

     The two men move their argument forward with the deliberation
     and formality of chess masters.

                    BOBBY
               (tired sounding)
          The United States cannot agree to such
          terms under threat.  Any belief to the
          contrary --
               (beat)
          -- was in error.

     Dobrynin reels internally.  The only sign on his face is a
     slight tremor.  Bobby looks up, registers the calculated
     effect.  And to Dobrynin's horror, the Russian believes:

                    DOBRYNIN
          You want war...

     But not so fast.  Bobby folds his hands.  And he smoothly
     goes from hard-ass brinksman to sensitive deal-maker.

                    BOBBY
          However, while there can be no quid pro
          quo on this issue, the United States can
          offer a private assurance.

     Dobrynin holds his breath.

                    BOBBY (CONT'D)
          Our Jupiter missiles in Turkey are
          obsolete, and have been scheduled for
          withdrawal for some time.  This
          withdrawal should be completed within,
          say, six months.

     Dobrynin lets out his breath.

                    BOBBY (CONT'D)
          Of course, any public disclosure of this
          assurance would negate the deal and
          produce the most stringent denials from
          our government.

     Dobrynin grasps the move immediately, understanding the
     ramifications.  Still he hesitates a moment.

                    DOBRYNIN
          This private assurance represents the
          word of the Highest Authority?

                    BOBBY
          Yes.

                    DOBRYNIN
          And it can be relayed beyond Comrade
          Khruschev's ears to the top circles of
          my government

                    BOBBY
          Of course.  Our pledge can be relayed to
          any government official Secretary
          Khruschev sees fit to satisfy.

     Meaning this is the bone he can show the hard line.  Dobrynin
     struggles internally, knowing what Bobby has done, wanting to
     hug him.  It comes across as agitation.

                    BOBBY (CONT'D)
          With the caveat that it is not made
          public in any way, shape or form.
               (beat)
          And we must have an answer tomorrow at
          the latest.  I cannot stress this point
          enough.

                    DOBRYNIN
          Tomorrow...

                    BOBBY
          Tomorrow...

     Dobrynin rises from his chair.  Bobby rises with him.

                    DOBRYNIN
          Then you must excuse me and permit me to
          relay the substance of our discussion to
          my superiors.

     Dobrynin heads for the door.  Half way there he turns back to
     Bobby, deeply moved.  Deeply grateful.

                    DOBRYNIN (CONT'D)
          We have heard stories that some among
          your military men wish for war.
               (beat)
          You are a good man.  Your brother is a
          good man.  I assure you there are other
          good men.  Let us hope the will of good
          men is enough to counter the terrible
          strength of this thing which has been
          put in motion.

     INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

     Kenny enters the Oval Office through his side door.  The
     office is dark, only the desk lamp on.  Kenny's gaze moves
     over the trappings of power: the carpet with the Presidential
     Seal, the rocking chair by the fireplace, the desk.

     And on the desk, tucked almost out of sight, sits a small,
     humble wooden plaque.  It's turned to face the occupant of
     the chair behind the desk.  Kenny reaches out, turns it
     around.  It is the Breton's Fisherman's Prayer.

     It reads: OH LORD, THY SEA IS GREAT, MY BOAT SO SMALL.

                    BOBBY (O.S.)
          We're out here.

     Kenny holds on the plaque a beat, and looks up at the open
     French door to the Rose Garden.  The curtains swirl around
     him in the wind as he goes through the door and out --

     EXT. PORTICO - CONTINUOUS

     -- onto the portico.  Standing there in the dark, by the
     white neoclassical pillars of the cloister, are Bobby and the
     President.  They're holding drinks.  Kenny joins them.

     The President gestures out across the South Lawn to the
     gleaming Washington Monument.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          We were just debating who had it worse,
          us or George Washington and his guys.

                    BOBBY
          He didn't have to worry about nuclear
          weapons.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Yeah, but the country didn't even exist
          as a country yet.  It was a mess, and he
          didn't have a leg to stand on.

                    KENNY
          All he had was his character.

     The President and Bobby nod at the justice of that remark.

                    BOBBY
          How does a guy get a rep like that?

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Doesn't matter to me.  If I went down in
          history like Adams, I'd die happy.  All
          they say about him today is --

                    KENNY
          -- he kept the peace.

     Kenny looks at the President.  The President feels it, and
     gazes back to him.

     The three of them stare out at the glittering city.  The
     grandness of the world lies before them, and they are
     deciding its fate, and are humbled by the awfulness of it. 
     The silence is beyond power.

     And for a long moment, they know not to disturb it.  There is
     nothing left to say.  The President, at last, finishes his
     drink.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          You know, we never did control it.  Not
          really.  Not like we think.

     He looks at Kenny.  Kenny nods.  He knows that now too.

                    THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
          But we did our best.  Now it's up to
          them.

     EXT. O'DONNELL DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

     Kenny's limo pulls away, leaving Kenny, coat in hand, at the
     bottom of his driveway.  He watches it go, silently urging it
     to return for him with some call from the President telling
     him he's desperately needed.  But it doesn't.

     He turns to his house.  The lights are all out.

     He notices he's CLUTCHING the handle of his briefcase.  His
     knuckles are white.  With conscious effort, he unfolds his
     hand, letting the briefcase drop on the driveway.

     He stands alone, stripped of his friends, his family, his
     job... and in that moment, mute, impotent in the shadow of
     Armageddon, Kenny is our Everyman of the Nuclear Age.

     INT. O'DONNELL KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     Helen stands in the kitchen, a ghostly white figure in her
     robe, the windows open and curtain flapping as she breathes
     the air.  Kenny enters.  He stands in the doorway.

                    HELEN
          I saw you out there.  You want him to
          call you back, need you.

                    KENNY
          No.  I'm glad I'm home.

     And she knows the worst.

                    HELEN
          How long do we have?

     Kenny's voice breaks. 

                    KENNY
          If the sun rises in the morning, it is
          only because of men of goodwill.
               (beat)
          And that's all there is between us and
          the Devil.

     They take each other in their arms, the wisdom of the atomic
     age so simple, so tenuous, every human life hanging by such a
     thread... yet a thread so powerful.  The CAMERA RISES FROM
     THEM, finding the OPEN WINDOW and the DARKNESS.

     INT. O'DONNELL BEDROOM - DAWN

     The RED DOME OF NUCLEAR FIRE rising over Washington.  It
     roils the air in its expanding, blood-red glory.

     It is the sun.  The dawn in the East.

     PULL BACK THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW.

     SUPER: SUNDAY, OCTOBER 28TH.  DAY 13

     into Kenny and Helen's bedroom.  And silence.  Kenny and
     Helen lie together on the bed.  The light burns into Kenny's
     half-shut eye.  Kenny is only dimly conscious of the light's
     meaning.  Until the PHONE SHRILLS downstairs.

     Kenny is instantly up, launched out of the room.

     INT. O'DONNELL KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     Kenny snatches the RED PHONE from its hook.

                    KENNY
          Yeah?

                    BOBBY (O.S.)
          Kenny.  It's over.

     EXT. ST. STEPHEN'S CHURCH - DAY

     THE CHURCH BELLS TOLL in raucous celebration.  Kenny, Helen
     and the five O'DONNELL KIDS join the throng packing through
     the doors to the church.  They're all smiling except Kenny
     who searches fro faces in the CROWD.

     And then he spots Bobby with his FAMILY.  Bobby grins at him. 
     That makes Kenny grin back.

                    RADIO MOSCOW (O.S.)
          This is Radio Moscow.  Moscow calling.

     But Kenny keeps looking.

                    RADIO MOSCOW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          The following statement is the text of a
          letter from General Secretary Khruschev
          to President Kennedy.

     Kenny spots him emerging from the Presidential limo,
     surrounded by Secret Service Agents - John Kennedy.  His
     FAMILY also is with him. 

                    RADIO MOSCOW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          ...I regard with respect and trust the
          statement you made in your message of 27
          October 1962 that there would be no
          attack, no invasion of Cuba, and not
          only the part of the United States, but
          also on the part of the Western
          Hemisphere, as you said in your same
          message.  Then the motives which induced
          us to render assistance of such a kind
          to Cuba disappear...

     Kennedy, greeting well-wishers, a brilliant smile on his
     face, is carried through the crowd toward Kenny and the doors
     of the church.

                    RADIO MOSCOW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          ...it is for this reason that we have
          instructed our officers - these
          missiles, as I already informed you are
          in the hands of Soviet officers to take
          appropriate measures to discontinue
          construction, dismantle them, and return
          them to the Soviet Union.

     EXT. MISSILE SITE - CUBA - DAY

     the base has been half-dismantled over night.  Fuel trucks
     pull away, lumping down the makeshift dirt road.  Across the
     site missiles are lowered, their nose cones being removed.

     A MISSILE on its transporter, Technicians crawling all over
     it, COVERING IT with a tarp.

     A massive Soviet Helicopter's rotors thunder as it lifts off,
     cargo crates swaying under it, a CLOUD OF DUST FROM ITS WASH
     FILLING THE SCREEN, WIPING US TO:

     INT. CABINET ROOM - DAY

     EXCOM laughing, celebrating, half-drunk already this Sunday
     morning.  The President shushes the group.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Hey!  Hey.  Okay, that's enough.

     The group quiets down.  The Presidents stares at them, calm,
     firm.  They sober up quickly.  Kenny listens, expectant.

                    THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
          I don't want any gloating.  This is not
          a victory over the Soviets.  It's a
          victory with the Soviets.
               (beat)
          I want everyone to remember that.

     INT. WEST WING HALLWAY - DAY

     Kenny rounds a corner.  McNamara, Bundy and McCone are
     talking, excited, hushed, standing to one side, down the
     hall.  Kenny eyes them as he draws closer, and then they
     notice he's approaching.  Bundy nods him over, confidential.

                    BUNDY
          We've been talking.  We can play this
          big in '64.  It's the foreign policy
          trophy we've been waiting.

     Kenny sickens.  He tries to listen, but it all begins to
     blur.

                    BUNDY (CONT'D)
          I think we can ride it all the way home
          next election.  Bet you're way ahead of
          us, eh?

     Bundy slaps Kenny on the back.  Kenny is pale.  Is what
     they're saying possible?  But Bundy and McCone are too
     wrapped up in their schemes to notice Kenny's distress.

                    MCCONE
          We've ordered crash reassessment of our
          major geopolitical hotspots.  We've got
          a lot of new clout, and we can run the
          table on the Soviets.  Middle East,
          Southeast Asia...

     And Kenny, sad, moved beyond all pity and loathing, realizes
     it is possible.  They haven't gotten it.  He is speechless,
     helplessly shaking his head.  Bundy finally sees something
     isn't right with him.

                    MCNAMARA
          What's wrong, O'Donnell?

     Kenny can't speak.  Can't find the words.  But tongue-tied
     finally manages:

                    KENNY
          Don't you understand?

     McNamara and Bundy look at him funny.

                    BUNDY
          Understand what?

     Kenny just looks at them, eyes filled with sorrow.  They
     begin to feel uncomfortable.

                    KENNY
          The sun came up today.

                    BUNDY
          Yeah.

                    KENNY
          It shouldn't have.  But it did.

                    MCCONE
          We were lucky we were able to keep it
          under control.

     Kenny looks away, unable to bear it.

                    KENNY
          Every day the sun comes up... says
          something about us.

                    BUNDY
          Says what, Kenny?

     Kenny looks back at them.

                    KENNY
          Something... amazing.

     They just stare at him.  And with secret smiles, superior
     smiles, they nod.

                    MCNAMARA
          Sure, Ken.  I understand.  Feels good to
          win, doesn't it?

     But they don't understand, and together turn away.

                    BUNDY
          See you later, Kenny.

     Kenny watches them, heads bowed in discussion, disappear into
     the labyrinth of the West Wing.  Kenny turns his back on
     them.

          INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - DAY

     The President stands at his mirror, tying a bow tie to a tux
     for some Sunday special event.  Kenny gathers up his folder
     from nearby breakfast table.

     Kenny meets the President's gaze in the mirror, and the two
     men know they have been to the same mountaintop.

                    THE PRESIDENT
          Kenny...

     A beat.  Kenny stands straight, ready for action, ready for
     some necessary thing.  Ready to go back into the game.

                    THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
          ...never mind.  See you around, Kenny.

     Kenny starts to leave, but at the door, turns back.

                    KENNY
          You know...

     The President looks at him in the mirror.

                    KENNY (CONT'D)
          ...this was what we're here for.

     The President smiles an ever-so-faint smile.  Kenny turns and
     leaves the room, vanishing, and as we HOLD on the empty
     doorway, the simple, whistled melody of O'DONNELL ABOO drifts
     from the hallway beyond, becoming our END MUSIC.

     FADE OUT

     SUPER:

     Shortly after the crisis President Kennedy ordered a
     reassessment of U.S.-Soviet relations, ushering a brief thaw
     in the Cold War.  During this time, the Washington-Moscow
     hotline was installed to ensure that in a future crisis,
     miscommunication would not lead to nuclear war.

     The President was assassinated on November 22nd, a year after
     the crisis ended.

     THE SUPER:

     Bobby Kennedy ran for president in 1968.  After winning the
     California primary, he called Kenny from the Ambassador Hotel
     in Los Angeles and told him, "I finally feel like I'm out
     from under my brother's shadow."

     Bobby was assassinated minutes later.

     THEN SUPER:

     The members of EXCOM continued  to serve with distinction in
     government in various capacities over the next three decades.
     As Lyndon Johnson's Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara
     urged containment of the Soviet threat in every theatre of
     conflict around the world.  He ultimately advised President
     Johnson to increase the U.S. military commitment to one of
     these minor backwater conflicts: Vietnam.

     AND FINALLY SUPER:

     Kenny O'Donnell witnessed the President's assassination from
     the car behind.  He went on to head the Peace Platform at the
     1968 Democratic National  Convention, fighting to end the
     Vietnam War.  He died in 1977.
