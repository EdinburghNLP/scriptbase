In October, 1962, U-2 surveillance photos reveal that the Soviet Union is in the process of placing nuclear weapons in Cuba.
These weapons have the capability of wiping out most of the Eastern and Southern United States in minutes if they become operational.
President John F. Kennedy and his advisors must come up with a plan of action against the Soviets.
Kennedy is determined to show that he is strong enough to stand up to the threat, and the Pentagon advises U.S. military strikes against Cuba--which could lead the way to another U.S. invasion of the island.
However, Kennedy is reluctant to follow through, because a U.S. invasion could cause the Soviets to retaliate in Europe.
A nuclear showdown appears to be almost inevitable.
Can it be prevented?
