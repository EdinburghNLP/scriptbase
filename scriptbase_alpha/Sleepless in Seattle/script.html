<b>	FADE IN:
</b>


<b>	CLOSE ON SAM BALDWIN
</b>


	A card: Chicago.



	He's in his thirties.  His neck is pinched into a crisp 

	dress shirt and tie.  His expression is vacant, faraway.

	A breeze blows but he doesn't react to it.  In the 

	distance the architecture of the Chicago skyline.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		   Mommy got sick and it happened 

		   just like that and there was 

		   nothing anybody would do.

			   (continued)



	And pull back to reveal:



<b>	EXT. CHICAGO - A GRAVESITE - DAY
</b>


	Next to Sam is his son Jonah, age 9.  Sam's hand is on 

	his shoulder.  As the mourners go past and each takes a 

	turn shoveling a clod of dirt into an open grave --



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    If we start asking why we'll go 

		    crazy.  So, rule number one.  

		    We don't ask why.



<b>							CUT TO:
</b>


<b>	CLOSE ON ANNIE REED
</b>


	Pretty, blonde, animated.  Jeans, a T-shirt, a Baltimore 

	Orioles hat.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Why? I just want to know why? 

		    That's my first rule.  I always 

		    ask why.  Come on.  Tell me.  

		    C'mon, c'mon, c'mon --



	And pull back to reveal:



<b>	EXT. CHICAGO ALLEY - DAY
</b>


	Annie is talking to her boyfriend, a good-looking guy 

	named SETH.  They're carrying packing boxes into the 

	house they share in the Old Town section of Chicago.  

	The same stunning architecture in the b.g.  They go up 

	the back wooden staircase to the house.



<b>				 SETH
</b>
		    There's no why, Annie.  I'm 

		    just not up for it.  I never 

		    said I was.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Is there somebody else?



<b>				 SETH
</b>
		    Nope.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    You don't love me, is that it?



<b>				 SETH
</b>
		    Nope.



	Follow them into:



<b>	INT. KITCHEN - DUSK
</b>


	As they set down the packing boxes and Seth starts to 

	assemble them.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    How about ... you're too 

		    narcissistic to commit to 

		    another human being in a long-

		    term way.



<b>				 SETH
</b>
			   (agreeably)

		    That's good.



<b>							CUT TO:
</b>


<b>	INT. SAM'S CHICAGO TOWN HOUSE - DAY
</b>


	An attractive, thirtyish couple, SUZY and GREG are 

	stocking Sam's freezer with enough Ziploc meals for a 

	months.  A number of friends and relatives talk quietly 

	in the living room beyond.  Sam stands alone by a window 

	that looks into the backyard.  We can see a garden of 

	flowers -- clearly planted by Sam's wife.



<b>				 SUZY
</b>
		    Five minutes in the microwave.  

		    Any one of them, five minutes 

		    and done.  Ready to eat.  Do 

		    you know how to make juice?



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Microwave.  Five minutes.



<b>							CUT TO:
</b>


<b>	ANNIE'S KITCHEN - SEVERAL DAYS LATER
</b>


	Packing boxes.  Seth is moving out.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    You take the microwave?



<b>				 SETH
</b>
		    What am I going to do with a 

		    microwave?



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    You turn it on, you open it and 

		    you stand in front of it for a 

		    very long time.



<b>				 SETH
</b>
		    So you're angry.  Big deal.



<b>							CUT TO:
</b>


<b>	SAM'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>


	A large modern architectural firm in a Chicago high-

	rise.  Lake Michigan out the window.  A large space with 

	several architects consulting, drafting, etc.  Sam is at 

	his desk, working.  An older colleague, ROB, comes over 

	to him.  Rob has a mustache, smokes a pipe; he's kind 

	but a little stuffy.



<b>				 ROB
</b>
		    Young man, it's none of my 

		    business, but maybe you should 

		    talk to someone.  I myself 

		    have consulted a professional.  

		    I used to be up tight.



	On Sam's face.  It's hard to imagine Rob being any more 

	uptight than he is.  Sam takes some business cards out 

	of his shirt pocket and reads them off.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Hypnotherapy...Shiatu Massage...

		    Loss of Spouse support groups...

		    Single parent discussion nights...

		    Parents without partners.

			   (starts riffling, angry)

		    Partners without parents.  

		    People who need people.  Guys 

		    who go into the woods, beat 

		    drums and bond.  Get a shrink.  

		    Hug a friend.  Hug yourself.



	He stops, realizing that everyone in the room is staring 

	at him.  Quickly they pretend they weren't paying 

	attention.  Someone whispers something to a client.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
			   (continued)

		    Don't mind him.  He's the guy 

		    who just lost his wife.

			   (beat)

		    What I really think is we need 

		    a change.



<b>				 ROB
</b>
		    Good idea.  Take a few weeks 

		    off, get some sun, take Jonah 

		    fishing --



<b>				 SAM
</b>
			   (shaking his head no)

		    A real change.  New city.  

		    Someplace where every time I go 

		    around a corner I don't think 

		    of Maggie.



	And hold on Sam for a moment and--



<b>							DISSOLVE:
</b>


<b>	EXT. WRIGLEY FIELD - DAY
</b>


	Sam, Jonah and Maggie walking toward the field.  It's a 

	gorgeous day for a game.  They high-five each other.



<b>				 ROB (V.O.)
</b>
		    Where you going to go?



	And cut back to:



<b>	INT. SAM'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>


	As Sam snaps out of it.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    I was thinking about Seattle.



<b>	INT. CHICAGO TRIBUNE - DAY
</b>


	The Living Section of the paper.  Annie is blowing her 

	nose as she finishes telling her tale of woe to her 

	boss, LAURIE JOHNSON.



<b>				 LAURIE
</b>
		    Honey, he wasn't right for you.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
			   (blowing her nose)

		    I know.



<b>				 LAURIE
</b>
		    He wasn't even wrong for you, 

		    like cosmically wrong, so don't 

		    beat up on yourself for 

		    wasting...however long it was.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    I know.

			   (blowing her nose 

			    again)



	She pours Annie a cup of hot water.  Annie pulls a 

	teabag out of her pocket, puts it into the water.



<b>				 LAURIE
</b>
		    Maybe you should see a shrink.



<b>			         ANNIE
</b>
		    I want my money.



<b>				 LAURIE
</b>
		    Go home for the weekend.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
			   (after a beat)

		    That's what I'm going to do.  

		    I'm going to go home.

			   (she thinks about it)

		    I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm 

		    going back to Baltimore.

			   (she's giddy)

		    How does a blonde do a high-

		    five?



	She smacks herself in the head.



<b>							CUT TO:
</b>


<b>	O'HARE AIRPORT - DAY
</b>


	The X where walkway K crosses with walkway L.  Coming 

	down walkway K are Sam, Jonah, Suzy, Greg, their son 

	MACK, and several other friends.



	And coming down walkway L is Annie with Laurie and a 

	couple of FRIENDS from the paper, JUDITH and DIANE.



	They pass each other going in diagonal directions and 

	continue on.



	We stay with Sam's group:



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
			   (to Mack)

		    Dad says I'm going to get used 

		    to it, but I don't think you 

		    can ever get used to a 

		    designated hitter.



	overlap:



<b>				 SUZY
</b>
			   (to Sam)

		    Eventually, in a few months, 

		    you'll start seeing women, 

		    you'll meet someone.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Move on.  Right.  That's what 

		    I'm going to do.  In a few 

		    months, boom, I'll be fine, 

		    I'll just grow a new heart.



<b>				 SUZY
</b>
		    I'm sorry --



<b>				 GREG
</b>
		    Sam, she didn't mean --



	Sam is shaking his head no as they reach the gate for 

	the Seattle plane.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    I know, I know.

			   (emphatic)

		    Look, it doesn't happen twice.



<b>							CUT TO:
</b>


	Annie's group, as they approach the gate for the 

	Baltimore plane.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    I'm going to meet someone, 

		    someone nice and stable who 

		    wears a hat so he won't catch a 

		    cold, and I'm going to marry 

		    him and have three children 

		    and live happily ever after.  

		    I mean, I am not cut out for this 

<b>		    --
</b>

<b>				 DIANE
</b>
		    For what?



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    For life as we know it.



<b>				 LAURIE
</b>
		    Just make sure he isn't fat 

		    like my Michael or you'll spend 

		    your whole life worrying he's 

		    going to drop dead.



<b>				 JUDITH
</b>
		    God, you guys are so romantic.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Do you know how long romance 

		    lasts?

			   (she snaps her fingers)

		    That long.



<b>				 DIANE
</b>
		    Steven still brings me flowers 

		    every Friday and we've been 

		    married 10 years.



<b>				 LAURIE
</b>
			   (to Diane)

		    Honey, nobody wants to hear 

		    that.

			   (to Annie)

		    Here, darling, have some Tic 

		    Tacs.



	Kissing everyone.  Annie starts toward the plane, loaded 

	with stuff.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    The next time you see me I am 

		    going to be incredibly happy.



<b>	INT. PLANE - NIGHT
</b>


	Sam and Jonah sitting together as the plane waits on the 

	runway.  He notices his father's distractedness, reaches 

	over and takes his hand.  Sam comes back into focus.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    I'm your dad.  Don't ever 

		    forget that.  That's rule 

		    number two.

			   (beat)

		    It's you and me, kid.



<b>	INT. PLANE - NIGHT
</b>


	Annie sitting by herself as the plane waits on the 

	runway.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
			   (to herself)

		    I guess it's just us.



	She gulps.



<b>	EXT. O'HARA AIRPORT - NIGHT
</b>


	The two planes face in opposite directions, waiting for 

	instructions.



	And now they both start to take off.  In opposite 

	directions.



	And we pull back back back back as the planes take off, 

	one flying east, the other flying west.



	And further and further back as they soar into the air 

	and leave the frame.



	The night sky.



	Stars twinkle.



	And now tilt down to see the United States.  It looks 

	like a cross between a satellite photo and a drawing by 

	Saul Steinberg.



	A light goes on in Baltimore.



	A light goes on in Seattle.



	They are the only lights on the map.



<b>	EXT. BALTIMORE SUN BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON - CHRISTMAS EVE
</b>


	As Annie comes out of the newspaper building with WALTER 

	JACKSON, a tall, handsome man who wears a hat.  They're 

	carrying an armful of Christmas presents.  They're 

	walking toward the parking lot.



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    The short one with black hair 

		    is your cousin Irene --



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    -- who's married to --



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    Harold, who ran away with his 

		    secretary but came back --



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    -- because Irene threatened to 

		    put the dog to sleep if he 

		    didn't --



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    And your brother Tom is a 

		    psychology professor and is 

		    married to...Betsy --



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    -- who is the most competitive 

		    woman in the world --



	They put the presents in the backs of their two cars and 

	pull out together.



<b>	EXT. A HOUSE IN BALTIMORE SUBURBS - NIGHT
</b>


	Christmas lights twinkling as the two cars pull up in 

	front of a comfortable upper middle-class house and park 

	their cars.  They get out assembling presents.



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    Your Uncle Milton lost all his 

		    money in a Puerto Rican 

		    condominium that went belly up, 

		    don't mention the IRS or the 

		    Federal prison system.  Your 

		    mother is Barbara, your father 

		    is Cliff --



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    I hope he doesn't get out his 

		    slides.



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    Am I what they had in mind?



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    They're going to love you.



	As they start toward the house.



<b>							CUT TO:
</b>


<b>	CLANGING ON THE WINE GLASSES.
</b>


<b>	AND PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

<b>	INT. ANNIE'S PARENTS' DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>


<b>				 BARBARA
</b>
		    Everybody! Annie has an announcement --



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Walter and I are engaged!



	And the family's at the diner table.  Annie's family is 

	a completely normally-looking WASP family -- only 

	everyone is a little eccentric.  Annie's mother BARBARA, 

	a beautiful gray-haired, fantastically cheerful woman, 

	claps her hands together.  Her father CLIFF, who's at 

	the head of the table next to her, gives Annie a kiss.  

	Annie's brother TOM and his wife BETSY are at the table, 

	along with cousin IRENE and her husband HAROLD.  UNCLE 

	MILTON, who's Irene's father and Barbara's brother.  

	There are about FIVE CHILDREN there, too.



<b>				 IRENE
</b>
		    That's wonderful, Annie.  I 

		    hope it lasts... for years 

		    and years.



<b>				 BETSY
</b>
			   (the competitive one)

		    Do you have a ring?



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    No.  Not yet.



<b>				 BETSY
</b>
		    Oh.  Well.  How will anyone 

		    know?



<b>				 TOM
</b>
		    Because you're going to call 

		    them all and tell them.  

		    Congratulations, Walter.



	He claps Walter on the back.



	Walter sneezes.  And sneezes again.



<b>				 CLIFF
</b>
		    Are you all right?



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    It's nothing.  Nothing.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    It's probably just the flowers --



<b>				 BARBARA
</b>
		    We'll move them --



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    Don't touch them.  I feel 

		    terrible sneezing at a time 

		    like this.  This is a big 

		    moment for me --



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
			   (overlapping)

		    He's allergic to everything, 

		    don't worry about it --



<b>				 HAROLD
</b>
		    Bees.  I'm allergic to bees.



<b>				 CLIFF
</b>
		    Not salmon I hope --



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    If he eats one tiny piece of a 

		    nut --



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
			   (cheerfully)

		    My head swells up like a 

		    watermelon and I drop dead.



<b>				 IRENE
</b>
		    It's the same with Harold and 

		    bees.



<b>				 CLIFF
</b>
		    Your mother and I had salmon at 

		    our wedding, and I really think 

		    a wedding without cold salmon --



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    I'm not allergic to salmon.  I 

		    don't think.  But you never 

		    know.



<b>				 HAROLD
</b>
		    You never know.



<b>				 BARBARA
</b>
		    Oh, honey, I feel terrible, we 

		    used up this magnum of 

		    champagne we were saving on 

		    something else, what did we use 

		    it for?



<b>				 TOM
</b>
		    Uncle Milton's parole --



<b>				 BARBARA
</b>
		    Right.



<b>				 UNCLE MILTON
</b>
		    And it was delicious.



<b>				 BARBARA
</b>
		    It was, wasn't it, Milton 

		    darling --



<b>				 BETSY
</b>
		    When are you getting married, 

		    Annie?



<b>				 CLIFF
</b>
		    In early June.  In the garden.



<b>				 HAROLD
</b>
		    Does it have to be in the garden?



<b>				 IRENE
</b>
		    What about Harold and bees?



<b>				 BARBARA
</b>
		    We'll spray you.



<b>				 CLIFF
</b>
		    Cold salmon.  A lovely cucumber 

		    salad.  Strawberries.



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    I'm afraid I'm allergic to 

		    strawberries.



<b>				 CLIFF
</b>
		    No strawberries.



	Annie smiles at Walter.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
			   (to Walter)

		    Is that all right with you?



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
			   (to Lou Gehrig line)

		    Today I consider myself the 

		    luckiest man on the face of 

		    the earth.



<b>				 IRENE
</b>
		    What are you wearing?



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    I don't know.



<b>				 BETSY
</b>
		    I wish you would wear my dress.  

		    I only wore it once, and you'll 

		    barely have to do anything to 

		    it except take it in in the 

		    bust --



<b>				 BARBARA
</b>
		    I have something that might do 

<b>		    --
</b>


<b>	INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER
</b>


	Walter is sitting on the couch as Cliff shows him slides 

	of cloud formations in Guatemala.  In the next room 

	Tom's at the piano and the kids are singing Christmas 

	carols.



<b>	INT. BACK STAIRWAY - SIMULTANEOUS
</b>


	MAX, one of the children, is teaching Uncle Milton to 

	burp.



<b>	INT. ATTIC - NIGHT
</b>


	The sound of Christmas carols from below.



	The attic is full of boxes and Annie walks through with 

	her mother.  They come to a dressmakers dummy with a 

	sheet over it.  Barbara removes the sheet.  A beautiful 

	antique dress.  A veil sitting on top of the dummy.



<b>				 BARBARA
</b>
		    The Historical Society wanted 

		    this and I never would give it 

		    to them --



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.



<b>				 BARBARA
</b>
		    I notice these things are back 

		    in fashion.  Oh, honey.

			   (tears are rolling down 

			    her face as she tries 

			    the veil on Annie)

		    He's a lovely man, Annie.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    I know.  He's wonderful, isn't 

		    he?



<b>				 BARBARA
</b>
		    Are his folks nice?



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    You'll love them.  We're going 

		    down to D.C.  tonight to be with 

		    them Christmas morning.



<b>				 BARBARA
</b>
		    How did it happen?



	Barbara starts to unbutton the tiny buttons on the back 

	of the dress and remove it from the dummy.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    It's silly, really.  I mean, 

		    I'd seen him at the office, 

		    obviously I'd seen him, he's 

		    the associate publisher, and 

		    then one day we both ordered 

		    sandwiches from the same place, 

		    and he got my lettuce and 

		    tomato sandwich on whole wheat, 

		    which of course he was allergic 

		    to, and I got his lettuce and 

		    tomato on white.



<b>				 BARBARA
</b>
			   (utterly without irony)

		    How amazing.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    It is, isn't it? You make 

		    millions of decisions that mean 

		    nothing and then one day you 

		    decide to order takeout and it 

		    changes your life.



<b>				 BARBARA
</b>
		    Destiny takes a hand.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Oh, please.  Destiny's just 

		    something we've invented 

		    because we can't stand the fact 

		    that everything that happens is 

		    accidental.



<b>				 BARBARA
</b>
		    Then how do you explain that 

		    you both ordered exactly the 

		    same sandwich except for the 

		    bread? How many people in this 

		    world like lettuce and tomato 

		    without something else like 

		    tuna?



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    It wasn't a sign.  It was a 

		    coincidence.



	Barbara shrugs, slips the dress off the dummy and Annie 

	steps into it.



	Barbra starts to button the dress on Annie.



<b>				 BARBARA
</b>
		    I was in Atlantic City with my 

		    family.  Cliff was a waiter.  

		    He talked me into sneaking out 

		    for a midnight walk on the 

		    Steel Pier.  I've probably told 

		    you this a million times, but 

		    I don't care.  And then he held 

		    my hand.  I was scared.  All 

		    sorts of thing were going 

		    through my head.  But after a 

		    while I forgot about them.  At 

		    one point I looked down, at our 

		    hands, and I couldn't tell 

		    which fingers were mine and 

		    which were his.  And I knew.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
			   (hearing it for the 

			    first time)

		    What?



<b>				 BARBARA
</b>
		    You know.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
			   (she doesn't know, but 

			    she doesn't want her 

			    mother to know she 

			    doesn't know)

		    What?



<b>				 BARBARA
</b>
		    Magic.  It was magic.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
			   (repeating)

		    Magic.



<b>				 BARBARA
</b>
		    I knew we would be together 

		    forever, and that everything 

		    would be wonderful, just the 

		    way you feel about Walter.  

		    Walter.  It's quite a formal 

		    name, isn't it?

			   (lowering her voice)

		    One of the things I truly knew 

		    was that your father and I were 

		    going to have a wonderful time

		    ... in the sack I believe you 

		    call it --



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Mom!



<b>				 BARBARA
</b>
		    Of course it took several years 

		    before everything worked like 

		    clockwork in that department, 

		    so don't be worried if it takes 

		    a while --



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Mom, we already...



<b>				 BARBARA
</b>
		    Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da 

		    dee.  And how's it working?



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Like... clockwork.



	She turns to look in the mirror.  The dress doesn't fit 

	at all.  It's completely lopsided.  One shoulder is 

	higher than the other.  The waist is in the wrong spot.  

	The effect is quite comical.



<b>				 BARBARA
</b>
		    So you'll get married in a new 

		    dress.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    It's a sign.



<b>				 BARBARA
</b>
			   (gently)

		    You don't believe in signs.



<b>	EXT. STREET - LATE
</b>


	The house Christmas lights sparkle outside, twinkling on 

	the tree inside, and the warm light spilling out.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    They loved you.  I told you 

		    they would love you and they 

		    did.



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    I love you.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    I love you, Walter.

			   (beat)

		    Did anyone ever call you 

		    anything other than Walter?



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    Nope.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Even when you were young?



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    Nope.  Not even when I was 

		    young.



	It's starting to rain.



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    You sure you don't want to 

		    drive with me?



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    How will I get back to 

		    Baltimore Saturday?

			   (remembering something)

		    Oh God, I forgot my present for 

		    your stepmother -- I took it 

		    inside by accident.



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    I'll wait.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Don't be silly.  I'll just be 

		    ten minutes behind you.



<b>	EXT. BELTWAY - NIGHT
</b>


	As Annie drives back toward Washington, D.C.



	Raining.



<b>	INT. CAR - NIGHT
</b>


	Annie driving.  Presents on the front seat.  She's 

	singing "Sleigh Ride" and doing all the sound effects 

	and clipclops and giddyups.  After a moment, she 

	realizes she doesn't know all the words and turns on the 

	radio.



<b>				 DR. MARSHA'S FIELDSTONE'S VOICE
</b>
		    Welcome back to "You and Your 

		    Emotions." I'm Dr.  Marcia 

		    Fieldstone broadcasting across 

		    America from the top of the 

		    Sears Tower in Chicago where we 

		    would have a fantastic view of 

		    Santa Claus and his reindeer if 

		    there was a -- oops, never 

		    mind.  Tonight we're talking 

		    about wishes and dreams.  

		    What's your wishes this Christmas 

		    Eve? Maybe the best present 

		    you can give yourself is a call 

		    to me.  The number is --



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Give me a break.



	Annie changes the station.



<b>				 RADIO VOICE
</b>
		    The subject of the evening's 

		    medical update is You and Your 

		    Spleen and our host --



	She flips the dial back the other way.



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    Our caller is from Seattle.



	Annie changes the station.



<b>				 RADIO VOICE
</b>
		    Coming up, Jingle Bells 

		    backwards, sung by the New 

		    Jersey Cape Mayettes --



	Annie twists the dial back the other way.  We hear a 

	YOUNG BOY's voice.



<b>				 BOY'S VOICE (V.O.)
</b>
		    Hello, this is Jonah --

			   (there's a bleep as 

			    Jonah says his last 

			    name)



	Annie's hand lingers on the dial.



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    No last names, Jonah.  Hello 

		    there, you sound younger than 

		    our usual callers.  How come 

		    you're up so late?



<b>				 JONAH (V.O.)
</b>
		    It's not that late in Seattle.



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    Got me there.  What's your 

		    Christmas wish, Jonah?



<b>				 JONAH (V.O.)
</b>
		    It's not for me.  It's for my 

		    dad.  I think he needs a new 

		    wife.



	Annie shakes her head.



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    You don't like the one he was 

		    now?



<b>				 JONAH (V.O.)
</b>
		    He doesn't have one now.  

		    That's the problem.



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    Where's your mom?



<b>				 JONAH (V.O.)
</b>
		    She died.



	Annie closes her eyes for a moment.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    I don't believe this --



<b>	EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
</b>


	As the car drives along.



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.



<b>				 JONAH (V.O.)
</b>
		    I've been pretty sad, but I 

		    think my dad is worse.



<b>	INT. CAR - NIGHT
</b>


<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    And you're worried about him.



<b>				 JONAH (V.O.)
</b>
		    I'm worried about him, he's 

		    worried about me, I ride my 

		    bike to school, he follows in 

		    the car, like I'm not supposed 

		    to know he's there.  Now it's 

		    Christmas, and you know what 

		    happens to people at Christmas.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    They lose their minds and call 

		    crackpot doctors on the radio --



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    Have you talked to your dad 

		    about this?



<b>				 JONAH (V.O.)
</b>
		    No.



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    Why not?



<b>				 JONAH (V.O.)
</b>
		    It's very hard for him to talk 

		    about this stuff.  It's like it 

		    makes him sadder.



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    You want me to talk to him?



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Perfect.  Sandbag the father.



<b>				 JONAH (V.O.)
</b>
		    And you crazy? He thinks shows 

		    like this are dumb.  If you 

		    didn't have an 800 number I 

		    could never get away with this 

<b>		    --
</b>


<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    Is he home right now?



<b>				 JONAH (V.O.)
</b>
		    Yeah.



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    Well, I think I can help a 

		    little more if I talk to him 

		    directly.



<b>				 JONAH (V.O.)
</b>
		    I don't know --



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    I'm sure he won't be angry once 

		    he realizes how concerned you 

		    are about him.



<b>				 JONAH (V.O.)
</b>
		    Okay, but if I get yelled at, 

		    I'm never gonna listen to this 

		    show again.



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    Fair enough.



<b>	INT. SAM'S HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT
</b>


	Jonah is on the telephone on the first floor of the 

	houseboat he lives in with Sam.  He's got the phone cord 

	coming out of the small first-floor study, and he's 

	standing near the kitchen end of a large living area 

	looking out at the back deck, where his dad is sitting 

	in a deck chair looking out at the sea.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    Dad --



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    What is it?



<b>	ON ANNIE AGAIN.
</b>


<b>				 JONAH (V.O.)
</b>
		    There's somebody on the phone 

		    for you.

			   (into phone)

		    His name is Sam.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    This is completely disgusting.



<b>	INT. BALDWIN HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT
</b>


	Sam pokes his head in the back door.  He looks much as 

	he did eighteen months earlier, except that his hair is 

	a little longer.  He picks up the phone extension.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Hello.



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia 

		    Fieldstone on Network America.



	Sam looks across the room to Jonah.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    I'm probably not interested in 

		    whatever you're selling.



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    I'm not selling anything.  Your 

		    son called and asked for advice 

		    on how to find you a new wife.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
			   (he really didn't get 

			    her name)

		    Who is this?



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
			   (repeating herself)

		    Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of 

		    Network America.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Jesus, are we on the air? 

		    Jonah, for God's sake --



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    Don't be mad at me, Dad.



	Sam can see Jonah.  He's frightened.  Sam immediately 

	feels how upset Jonah is.



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    He feels that since your wife's 

		    death you've been very unhappy. 

		    He's genuinely worried about you.



	Sam is looking at Jonah, who's rooted to the spot he's 

	standing on.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
			   (to Jonah)

		    I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm 

		    not mad at you.



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    I think it's hard for him to 

		    talk to you about all this.  

		    Maybe we could talk and it 

		    would make him feel a little 

		    better.



	Sam hesitates.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    Please --

</b>


<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    This is a grotesque violation 

		    of this man's personal life, 

		    but never mind --



<b>				 SAM (V.O.)
</b>
		    All righ...



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    Good.  How long ago did your 

		    wife die?



<b>	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT
</b>


<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    It's been about a year and a 

		    half.



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    Have you had any relationship 

		    since?



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    No.



	Sam is very uncomfortable about this --



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    Why not?



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Look, Doctor, I don't want to 

		    be rude, but --



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    And I don't want to invade your 

		    privacy --



<b>	INT. CAR - NIGHT
</b>


<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Sure you do.



<b>				 SAM (V.O.)
</b>
			   (overlapping)

		    Sure you do --



	Annie smiles.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Look, we had a tough time at 

		    first, but I think I'm holding 

		    my own as a dad, and Jonah and 

		    I will get along fine again as 

		    soon as I break his radio.



	Annie laughs.  So does Mr.  Fieldstone



<b>	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT
</b>


	Jonah is smiling too.



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    I have no doubt that you're a 

		    good dad.  You can tell a lot 

		    from a person's voice.  But 

		    something must be missing if 

		    Jonah feels that you're still 

		    under a cloud.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    Tell her how you don't sleep at 

		    night.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    How do you know that?



	Sam and Jonah both talk into their extensions, literally 

	talking to each other on the phone within their own 

	house, but also ON THE AIR.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    I can hear you walking around 

		    sometimes.  At first I thought 

		    it was a robber.  Go ahead, 

		    tell her, Dad.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    I don't think I have to now.



	Sam starts across the room towards Jonah, who starts 

	toward him, both of them holding their phone receivers.  

	On the wall in the dining area is a pine bench.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Look, it's almost Christmas --

			   (as the two of them sit 

			    down together on the 

			    bench)

		    A kid needs a mother --



	He puts an arm around Jonah.



<b>	INT. CAR - NIGHT
</b>


	As Annie listens.  She's softened considerably.



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    Could it be that you need 

		    someone just as much as Jonah 

		    does?



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Yes.



	Annie catches herself, covers her mouth in embarrassment.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    I'm losing my mind.



<b>	EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
</b>


	As Annie makes a turn off the beltway into a rest stop.



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    We've been talking to -- well, 

		    let's just call him Sleepless 

		    in Seattle, and we'll be right 

		    back after this break with 

		    listener response, your 

		    response, to the things we've 

		    been discussing.  The number to 

		    call is...



<b>	INT. BALDWIN HOUSE
</b>


<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    What's she talking about?



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    This is where other people get 

		    to call in and dump on what you 

		    said.



	We hear the beginning of a commercial.



<b>	INT. TRUCK STOP RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b>


	Annie walks in, anxious to break the spell of her radio 

	reverie.  She goes to the counter to order some coffee.  

	There's a commercial on the radio.  The counter WAITRESS 

	LORETTA is talking to the customers -- who include a 

	TRUCK DRIVER at a booth.  HARRIET, a short-order-cook, 

	is visible through an open window to the kitchen.



<b>				 LORETTA
</b>
		    I'll bet he's tall, with a cute 

		    butt.



<b>				 HARRIET
</b>
		    I'll bet he hasn't shaved in a 

		    week.  I'll bet he stinks.



<b>				 LORETTA
</b>

		    What'll it be?



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Coffee, please.  Black.  To go.



<b>				 LORETTA
</b>
		    Maybe I should hustle myself 

		    out to Seattle.  Give him a 

		    little present for New Year's 

		    Eve.



<b>				 HARRIET
</b>
		    You can go there if you want 

		    but don't open his refrigerator.  

		    They don't cover anything when 

		    they put it in the fridge.  

		    They just stick it in and leave 

		    it there till it walks out by 

		    itself.



<b>				 LORETTA
</b>
		    Harriet, ever since you 

		    divorced your last husband, 

		    you've been no fun.  I'm 

		    looking, and this guy pops my 

		    tarts.



<b>				 TRUCK DRIVER
</b>
		    Come on, Loretta, you're going 

		    to have to jump-start this guy.  

		    His battery's dead.  And look 

		    at me.  Mister Ever-Ready.  

		    Every six minutes, another 

		    charge.



<b>				 LORETTA
</b>
		    I'm looking for someone 

		    sensitive.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Come on, nobody wants a guy 

		    who's sensitive on the radio.



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    Let's take a call before we get 

		    back to Sleepless.  Knoxville, 

		    Tennessee, you're on.



<b>				 SWEET SOUTHERN VOICE
</b>
		    Yes, I would just like to know 

		    where I could get this man's 

		    address?

	live.



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    Do you think there's somebody 

		    out there you could love as 

		    much as your wife? Maybe even 

		    more?



<b>				 SAM (V.O.)
</b>
		    It's hard to imagine.



	And cut back and forth between the car and the 

	houseboat.  Sam and Jonah are still on the bench, but 

	Jonah has fallen asleep in Sam's lap.  Sam is stroking 

	the boy's hair.



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    What are you going to do, Sam?



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    I don't know.  When I met my 

		    wife, it was so clear.  I just 

		    knew.



	Annie is listening now.



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    What was it that made you know?



<b>				    SAM
</b>
		    I don't think I could really 

		    describe it.



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    Why not?



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    And if I could describe it, 

		    it probably wouldn't be on a radio 

		    show.

			   (he laughs to himself)

		    But what the hell.  It's not 

		    one specific thing.  It's more 

		    of a feeling.

			   (continued)



	Annie coasts to a stop outside a handsome mansion in 

	Washington, D.C., the motor running.  She's hooked now, 

	she's not getting out of the car until she's heard it 

	all.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    You touch her for the first 

		    time, and suddenly... you're 

		    home.  It's almost like...

</b>
		    Magic.

</b>
		    Magic.

<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    Well, it's time to wrap up, 

		    folks --



	A FIGURE appears at the passenger side window, which 

	Annie doesn't notice.  She's wiping the tears away with 

	her hand.



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    We hope you'll call again soon.



	The figure TAPS on the window --



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
			   (muffled, outside car)

		    Annie?



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
	    	    ... and let us know how it's 

	    	    going.



	-- and taps again.



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    Annie?



	She turns.  He's pointing at the locked door.  She 

	searches for the button.  Finally finds it so that 

	Walter can open the door.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    I'm sorry, Walter.  I just 

		    heard the most amazing thing on 

		    the radio.



	They start toward the front door, Walter and Annie 

	carrying presents, an overnight bag of Annie's.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    People call up these shows and 

		    you can't believe the stuff 

		    they say.  It's the end of 

		    privacy as we know it, this 

		    country is just one big global 

		    village with everyone out there 

		    going blah blah blah --



	As they enter the house, we hear Silent Night and we see 

	a Christmas tree, glittering with lights.

	As Jonah opens his presents under the tree and we cut 

	from gift to gift:



	A BROOKS ROBINSON BASEBALL GLOVE which Jonah loves and 

	which he puts on his hand and keeps on while continuing 

	to open:



	A TIE which mystifies him, but he hangs it around his 

	neck.



<b>	A PLAID SHIRT
</b>


	A MAP OF THE UNITED STATES -- the kind that's used in

	And now Sam brings out a long narrow present from behind

	Sam opens his present from Jonah, which is something he

		    The hopes are perfect -- 

		    beautiful, identical, smooth -- 

		    and they are for something 

		    really amazing I feel it in my 

		    bones --

		    And we desperately need spices.



	Where Sam is putting the spices they have -- pepper, 

	salt, paprika and oregano -- into the spice rack, which 

	has room for at least twenty more.  Jonah is 

	methodically making pancakes.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    Dad?  About last night?



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    It's never happening again.  

		    Right?



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    Right.



	There's a knock on the door.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Then it never happened.



	Sam goes to answer the door.



	TWO YOUNG WOMEN are standing there.  Both are wearing 

	quite a lot of Spandex.  One of them is named LULU.  It 

	says so on her jacket.  The other is JOBETH.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Hi.



<b>				 LULU
</b>
		    Hi.  Sam?



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Yes?



<b>				 LULU
</b>
			   (looking in and seeing 

			       Jonah)

		    You must be Jonah.



	Jonah nods.



<b>				 LULU
</b>
			   (to her friend)

		    See.  I told you.  Sam and 

		    Jonah.  I'm LULU.  This is 

		    JoBeth.



	JoBeth nods, and continues to nod as Lulu talks.



<b>				 LULU
</b>
			   (continues)

		    We live two piers over, don't 

		    we? Number 12, right? We're 

		    having like a really neat open 

		    house today from like four to 

		    whenever if you care to stop 

		    by.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Thanks, but... we've got plans.



<b>				 LULU
</b>
		    Well, here's the number.  If 

		    you ever find yourself 

		    Sleepless, give us a call.  We 

		    also... do babysitting.



	She winks.  JoBeth nods.



	Sam nods.



	Lulu waves goodbye, and she and JoBeth sashay off down 

	the dock.



	Jonah closes the door and turns to Sam.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    Not.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    My feelings exactly.

	Jonah and Sam are fishing off a dingy.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    How many people do you think 

		    heard that thing last night?



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    It plays in 50 states.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    What?!



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    Nobody else is going to know it 

		    was us.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    You're right.

		    You better hope so.



<b>	EXT. BALTIMORE SUN - MORNING
</b>


<b>	INT. LIFESTYLE SECTION - DAY
</b>


	A large open newsroom-type space with REPORTERS at 

	computers.  Around the perimeter are glass-partitioned 

	offices and meeting rooms.  Inside one of the offices is 

	BECKY, the Lifestyle editor of the Sun.  She's at a 

	table with Annie, now a reporter for the section, and 

	two other colleagues -- KEITH and WYATT.  Wyatt is 

	playing Gameboy.



<b>				 KEITH
</b>
		    This man sells the greatest 

		    soup you've ever eaten, there's 

		    a line around the block, and he 

		    is, I am not kidding, the meanest 

		    man in America.

			   (beat)

		    I feel strongly about this, 

		    Becky.  This is not just about 

		    soup.



<b>				 BECKY
</b>
		    Do it.  What else?



<b>				 WYATT
</b>
		    New Year's Eve.  Please don't 

		    make me write it.



	Becky looks at Wyatt, notices the Gameboy.



<b>				 BECKY
</b>
		    Wyatt, I do not mean to remind 

		    you of your mother, but if you 

		    don't put that game away, no TV 

		    for a week.



<b>				 WYATT
</b>
			   (pushing it to the 

			    center of the table)

		    Would someone look this up, 

		    don't tell me where.



	Becky is riffling through some papers on the table, 

	among which are some tearsheets from the Associated 

	Press wire.



<b>				 BECKY
</b>
		    Listen to this.  Phone service 

		    in the greater Chicago area was 

		    tied up for two hours Christmas 

		    Eve because some kid called a 

		    phone-in show to get a wife for 

		    his father.  Two thousand women 

		    called in for the number.



<b>				 KEITH
</b>
		    Jesus.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    I heard it.  This kid calls up 

		    and says my dad needs a wife 

		    and I'm talking to myself in 

		    the car saying, this is 

		    completely disgusting, you're 

		    taking advantage of a child, 

		    and then the father gets on and 

		    this shrinkette says, do you 

		    want to talk about it? And he 

		    says no as a matter of fact I 

		    don't, and I am saying, bravo! 

		    Right on! Don't talk to her, 

		    it's none of her business --

			   (she's completely into 

			    this story now)

		    -- and then suddenly, for no 

		    reason at all, he's talking 

		    about how much he loved his 

		    wife, and how he just --

			   (she snaps her fingers)

		    fell in love with her and I am 

		    crying.  Me.  A tear is 

		    actually rolling down my face.  

		    It was like what happens when I 

		    watch those phone company ads.  

		    I don't have to see the whole 

		    ad, I just have to see the part 

		    where the daughter gives her 

		    mother a refrigerator with a 

		    big red bow on it, have you 

		    seen that one?



	Everyone looks at her.  Apparently she's finished.



<b>				 BECKY
</b>
		    You should write something 

		    about this.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    About what?



<b>				 BECKY
</b>
		    Whatever it is.



<b>				 KEITH
</b>
			   (waving the AP story)

		    What it is is, there are a lot 

		    of desperate women out there 

		    looking for love.



<b>				 WYATT
</b>
		    Especially over a certain age.



	Annie is looking at them.  This isn't what she was 

	talking about at all, although she isn't quite sure what 

	she was talking about.



<b>				 KEITH
</b>
		    It is easier to be killed by a 

		    terrorist after the age of 40 

		    than it is to get married --



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    That is not true.  That 

		    statistic is not true.



<b>				 BECKY
</b>
		    It's not true, but it feels 

		    true.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    There's practically a whole 

		    book about how that statistic 

		    is not true --



<b>				 WYATT
</b>
		    Calm down.  You brought it up --



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
			   (sharply)

		    I did not, Wyatt.



	A beat, everyone pauses.  Things are a little out of 

	hand.



<b>				 BECKY
</b>
		    So where were we?



<b>				 WYATT
</b>
		    New Year's Eve.  I'll do it, 

		    okay?



<b>				 BECKY
</b>
		    Okay.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    If someone is a widower, why do 

		    they say he was widowed? Why 

		    don't they say he was widowered?



	Everyone looks at her strangely.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    I was jus wondering.



<b>	EXT. BALTIMORE STREET - DAY
</b>


	Annie walking purposefully, followed by Becky, hurrying 

	to catch up.



<b>				 BECKY
</b>
		    What was that about up there?



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    What was what?



<b>				 BECKY
</b>
		    What's with you?



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Nothing's with me.



<b>	INT. BALTIMORE RESTAURANT - DAY
</b>


	Becky and Annie are having lunch.



<b>				 BECKY
</b>
		    "Sleepless in Seattle"?



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    That's what she called him on 

		    the show.  Because he can't 

		    sleep.



<b>				 BECKY
</b>
		    And now 2,000 women want his 

		    number.  The guy could be a 

		    crackhead, a psychopath, a 

		    flasher, a junkie, a 

		    transvestite, a chain-saw 

		    murderer, or someone really 

		    sick, like Rick.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Actually, he sounded nice.



<b>				 BECKY
</b>
		    Oh? Oh, really? Now we're 

		    getting down to it.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Not.



	She reaches down for her purse.



<b>	INT/EXT. REMODEL HOUSE - DAY
</b>


	A hand reaching down to pick something up -- the Seattle 

	newspaper, and



<b>	PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
</b>


	Sam carrying the paper down/up the stairs to an old 

	house that's being renovated.  Jonah, who is playing 

	Cameboy, is walking along with him.  WORKMEN are active 

	everywhere.  Dry wall going up, cabinets being 

	installed, tile being set.



	One of Sam's partners, BOB LANGMAN, is walking with him, 

	and JAY MATHEWS, the on-site supervisor, is waiting for 

	them in an unfinished doorframe.  Bob is hefty, older, 

	always eating something dietetic.  Jay is younger and 

	always wears as little as possible, even in cold weather.



<b>				 BOB LANGMAN
</b>
		    Now she wants a circular 

		    stairwell off the den.



<b>				 JAY
</b>
			   (to Jonah, in b.g.)

		    Punch me, punch in right here.

			   (points to his stomach;

			    Jonah punches)

		    And she wants the Sub-Zero with 

		    the side-by-side doors --



<b>				 BOB
</b>
		    Which means --



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    The cabinets have to be redone 

<b>		    --
</b>


	They all nod at each other.  The woman has been a 

	nightmare.



<b>				 BOB
</b>
		    So we thought --



<b>				 JAY
</b>
		    Since you're on the make again 

<b>		    --
</b>


	Sam looks at Jonah --



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Great.  This is great.  The 

		    whole town knows.  Just out of 

		    curiosity, how do you two know?



<b>				 BOB
</b>
		    Grace heard it.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Grace the dispatcher.  Great.



<b>				 BOB
</b>
		    The point is, take the client 

		    out to dinner and ask her to 

		    marry you and then maybe we 

		    won't have to redo the kitchen 

		    cabinets.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Why me? What about Jay?



<b>				 JAY
</b>
		    Hey, my plate is full.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Well, okay.  What's the big 

		    deal?  If she'll forget the 

		    new fireplace, I'll marry her.  

		    Just point me in the right 

		    direction.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    Dad, I don't know about this 

		    one --



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Oh, you're changing your mind 

<b>		    --
</b>


<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    No, I'm not, but --



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    What's the matter with this 

		    one? Wouldn't you like to have 

		    Imelda Marcos as your mother?



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    Dad --



	Sam cuffs him good-naturedly.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    We better take the measurements 

		    for the new cabinets.



	He walks away past some workmen, ladders, etc.  and 

	starts checking the cross-beams in the ceiling over in 

	another area of the site.  Bob follows after him.  Jay 

	tosses Jonah a hammer and they start knocking nails into 

	the wall.



<b>				 BOB
</b>
		    Sam, if you're not doing 

		    anything New Year's -- 

		    obviously you're not doing 

		    anything New Year's -- we're 

		    having some people over, all of 

		    them married, not one even 

		    remotely interested in playing 

		    around.  Does that sound great 

		    or what?

			   (whistfully)

		    I can't think of the last time 

		    I was at a party when anything 

		    actually happened.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's 

		    kind of a big night.  I don't 

		    like to leave Jonah alone.

</b>
		    Shouldn't you have used a

</b>
		    I think I know how to have a

	He puts in the last spice.



	They stand back to admire it.  A beat.  The rack falls 

	off the wall.



	The rack itself doesn't break, but about six of the

	There's paprika and thyme and currying powder, etc.  all 

	over the floor along with shards of glass.

			   (still angry)

		    I'm sorry.

			   (softening)

		    I'm sorry.



	He picks up Jonah and holds him.

</b>
		    I'm sorry.  I'm just --

</b>
		    Stressed.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Right.  I'm sorry, Jonah, I'm

		    I'll take you to the Russian

<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    What is it?



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    It's delicious, trust me.



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    Does it have wheat in it?



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    I don't think so.



	They go on dancing.  It's one of those parties where 

	everyone looks so happy and so in love.  Annie, however, 

	looks thoughtful.



<b>	ET.  MARINA PARKING AREA - DAY
</b>


	Sam gets out of his car and starts down the dock toward 

	his houseboat.  He's carrying a bag of groceries.



	In the parking lot is a U.S.  MAIL TRUCK.



<b>	EXT. HOUSEBOAT - DAY
</b>


	Sam approaches his boat and a puzzled look comes over 

	his face.



	A MAILMAN with a sack of mail is standing outside the 

	front door of the houseboat.  Jonah is signing a receipt 

	for the mail.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    Look at this, Dad.  They're 

		    all for you --



	Sam picks up an envelop and looks at it.  It's 

	addressed to Sleepless in Seattle c/o Dr.  Marcia 

	Fieldstone, Radio Station KWRS in Chicago.  He's 

	stunned.  As he signs the receipt:



<b>				 MAILMAN
</b>
		    If you're having trouble 

		    sleeping, you might want to try 

		    drinking a glass of water from 

		    the other side.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    I thought that was for hiccups.



<b>				 MAILMAN
</b>
		    Does it work for hiccups?



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    For hiccups, a spoonful of 

		    sugar, you hold it in your 

		    mouth for a minute.



<b>				 MAILMAN
</b>
		    Really?



	The mailman starts back toward the mail truck.



	Sam and Jonah start toward the door.



<b>	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT
</b>


	Sam is in the kitchen making dinner.  Jonah is sitting 

	at the table, reading the letters from the stack they 

	found by the door.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Just out of curiosity, how did 

		    they get our address?



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    They called and asked for it.

			   (reading)

		    "Dear Sleepless in Seattle.  

		    You are the most attractive man 

		    I've ever laid ears on."



	Jonah rolls his eyes, tosses the letter into a pile of 

	rejects, opens another.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    How did they get our phone 

		    number?



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    You have to give them your 

		    phone number or they won't let 

		    you go on the air.



	Sam nods as if this makes perfect sense.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
			   (continues, reading)

		    "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I 

		    am an SWF"--

			   (to Sam)

		    What is that?



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Thank God.  Something you don't 

		    know.  It's a single white 

		    female.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    This is no good.  She's looking 

		    for someone French.  Or Greek.

			   (puzzled, he throws the 

			    letter into the reject 

			    pile, opens another)

		    "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I 

		    live in Tulsa." Where is that? 

<b>		    --
</b>


<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Oklahoma.  Do you know where 

		    that is?



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    Somewhere in the middle.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    I'm not going to think about 

		    what they're not teaching you 

		    in school.  I am not going to 

		    think about it.

			      (beat)

		    Generally speaking I think we 

		    should rule out people who 

		    don't live somewhere near here 

<b>		    --
</b>


<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    She's willing to fly anywhere.



	As Jonah hands Sam the picture.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    She looks like my third grade 

		    teacher.  I hated my third 

		    grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait 

		    a minute! She is my third 

		    grade teacher!



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    Dad, you're not taking this 

		    seriously.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    This is not how you do it.

			   (referring to the 

			    hamburger)

		    You want this on an English 

		    muffin or a bun?



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    English muffin.  How do you do 

		    it?



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    You see someone you like, you 

		    get a feeling about them, you 

		    ask them if they want to have a 

		    drink or --



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    -- a slice of pizza --



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    But not dinner necessarily on 

		    the first date because by the 

		    time you're halfway through 

		    dinner you might be sorry you 

		    asked them to dinner whereas if 

		    it's just a drink, if you like 

		    them you can always ask them 

		    for dinner but if you don't you 

		    can go home if you see what I 

		    mean.

			      (beat)

		    I wonder if it still works this 

		    way.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    It doesn't.  They ask you.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    I'm starting to notice that.



<b>	INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>


	Annie and Walter are making love.



<b>				 JONAH (V.O.)
</b>
		    If you get a new wife, I guess 

		    you'll have sex with her, huh?



<b>				 SAM (V.O.)
</b>
		    What do you think?



<b>				 JONAH (V.O.)
</b>
		    Will she scratch up your back?



<b>				 SAM (V.O.)
</b>
		    What?



<b>	JONAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>


	As Sam puts Jonah to sleep.  Jonah is holding his teddy 

	bear while this conversation concludes.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    In the movies women are always 

		    scratching up guy's back and 

		    screaming and stuff.  When 

		    they're having sex.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Whose show was this on?



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    Jed's got cables.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Go to sleep.



	He kisses him good-night.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    Kiss Howard.

			   (he holds out the 

			    teddy bear)

		    G'night, Howard.



<b>	INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>


	Annie and Walter have just finished making love.



	Walter falling asleep.



	Annie lying in bed, with her eyes open.



	She starts to get out of bed.  Puts on a robe.



<b>	INT. STAIRWAY - HOUSE
</b>


	As Annie comes downstairs in a bathrobe.



	She opens the door to the street.



<b>	EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</b>


	As Annie starts to run down the street.



<b>	CLOSEUP OF: ANNIE, RUNNING
</b>


	And now we widen out to see a misty highway she's running 

	down.



	Past a sign saying: Seattle Approximately 3,000 miles.



	Past another sign: Your nerves are shot.



	And another: Your feet are cold.



	And another: Will you find love.



	And another: Before you're cold?



	And another: Burma Shave.



	And Annie continues to run, and now we see she's running 

	across a map of the United States -- it's a little like 

	the one we saw in the beginning of the movie -- it's 

	like the famous map of the United States by Saul 

	Steinberg, but instead of being about New York, this one 

	is about Seattle.



	In the distance, at the very edge of the map, we see two 

	indistinct figures -- a map and a young boy.  They start 

	to wave at her, very slowly.



	Annie's eyes widen.



<b>							CUT TO:

	She turns the light on.



	Opens the refrigerator.



	Closes it.



	Opens it again.  Takes out some milk.



	Sits down at the kitchen table with a bowl, corn flakes, 

	banana.  She's about to assemble it when:



	She sees:



<b>	THE RADIO
</b>


	She stands up, turns it on to the station Dr. Marcia 

	Fieldstone is on.  She sits back down with her corn 

	flakes.



<b>				 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

			   (the teaser continues)



<b>				 WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
</b>
		He says he doesn't love me any

<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    Why do you want to be with

		    Every time I come close to

</b>
		    Why don't you make him a 

		    sandwich beforehand?



<b>				 SAM'S VOICE (V.O.)
</b>
		    When I met my wife, it was so 

		    clear.  I jus knew.



	Annie starts at hearing Sam's voice.



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    What was it that made you know?



<b>				 SAM'S VOICE (V.O.)
</b>
		    I don't think I could really 

		    describe it.



<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    Why not?



<b>				 SAM'S VOICE (V.O.)
</b>
		    And if I could describe it, it 

		    probably wouldn't be on a radio 

		    show.

			   (he laughs to himself)

		    But what the hell.  It's not 

		    one specific thing.  It's more 

		    of a feeling.  

			      (continuing)

		    You touch her for the first 

		    time, and suddenly... you're 

		    home.  It's almost like... 

		    magic.



	Annie closes her eyes.

<b>	EXT. BALTIMORE - PEABODY LIBRARY - DAY

	We see Annie's car pull into a parking space outside the 

	Peabody Library.  Annie gets out of the car.



<b>	INT. LIBRARY - DAY
</b>


	As Annie strides purposefully across the library and 

	enters:



<b>	INT. ANNIE'S BROTHER TOM'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>


	Annie bursts into Tom's office and walks over to his 

	desk.  We barely has time to look up.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    I think I'm going crazy, Tom.  

		    I really do.  Are you happily 

		    married?



<b>				 TOM
</b>
			   (completely panicked by 

			    the question)

		    What?



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    I mean, why did you get 

		    married? Was it all fireworks 

		    and trumpets and --



<b>				 TOM
</b>
			   (regaining composure)

		    I got married because Betsy 

		    said we had to break up or get 

		    married.  So we get married.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    But when you met her, did you 

		    believe she was the only person 

		    for you? That in some mystical, 

		    cosmic way, it was fated?



<b>				 TOM
</b>
		    Annie, when you meet someone 

		    and you're attracted to them, 

		    it just means that your 

		    subconscious is attracted to 

		    their subconscious, 

		    subconsciously.  So what we 

		    think of as chemistry is just 

		    two neuroses knowing that they 

		    are a perfect match.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    I don't even know him.  But 

		    I'm having all these fantasies 

		    about a man I've never met, 

		    who lives in Seattle.



<b>				 TOM
</b>
		    It rains nine months of the 

		    year in Seattle.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    I know, I know.  I do not want 

		    to move to Seattle.  But what I 

		    really don't want to do is end 

		    up always wondering what might 

		    have happened and knowing I 

		    could have done something.  

		    What do you think?

			   (Tom opens his mouth to 

			    say something, but 

			    before anything comes 

			    out, Annie fills the 

			    void)

		    It's just cold feet, isn't it? 

		    Everyone panics before they get 

		    married, didn't you?



<b>				 TOM
</b>
		    Yes, I did.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much 

		    better just having blown this 

		    off.

</b>
		    Any time.

		    bigger than her head or 

		    anything --



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    I'm not asking you to set me 

		    up, Jay.  That's not what I 

		    need your help for.  I want to 

		    know what it's like over there.



<b>				 JAY
</b>
		    And that's what I'm trying to 

		    tell you.  What women are 

		    looking over, okay? Pecs and a 

		    cute butt.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    You mean, like, "He has the 

		    cutest butt"? Where did I hear 

		    that recently?

</b>
		    Everywhere.  You can't even 

		    turn on the news without 

		    hearing about how some babe

<b>				 SAM
</b>
			   (trying to remember)

		    Seventy... eight.



<b>				 JAY
</b>
		    Well.  Things are different.  

		    First, you have to be friends.  

		    You have to like each other.  

		    Then you neck.  This can go on 

		    for years.  Then you have

		    The good news is, split the

		    I don't think it could let a

		    Great.  They'll have a parade

		    Some woman is going to want me

	No answers.

	He starts to look concerned.

		    Jonah?



	He goes down the hall to Jonah's room.  The door is

	Jonah is sitting on his bed listening to a tape.

		    It's nice to meet you, Jessica.

<b>	INT. AN UNFINISHED DINNER ON A PLATE IN ANNIE'S LIVING ROOM

</b>


	Annie is watching "An Affair to Remember" on television, 

	tears pouring down her face.  Cary Grant is saying: "Are 

	you in love with him?" Deborah Kerr replies: "I'm not 

	now."



	She's sitting at the dining room table.  A dozen pieces 

	of paper litter the table.  Annie's been unsuccessfully 

	typing a letter on an old Underwood typewriter.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Now those were the days when 

		    people knew how to be in love.



	She takes a blast from the wine glass to her right.  

	Becky leans in, refilling the glass.  Annie begins to 

	type and sob and look at the TV.



<b>				 BECKY
</b>
		    You're a basket case.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
			   (as she types)

		    They knew it.  Time, distance, 

		    nothing could separate them.  

		    Because they knew.  It was 

		    right.  It was real.  It was...



<b>				 BECKY
</b>
		    ... movie.

			   (beat)

		    That's your problem.  You don't 

		    want to be in love.  You want 

		    to be in love in a movie.

			   (beat)

		    Read it to me.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
			   (reading her letter)

		    "Dear Sleepless and Son..."



<b>				 BECKY
</b>
		    It sounds like the name of a 

		    mattress store --



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    "I am not the sort of person 

		    who listens to call-in radio 

		    shows" --



	Becky flops on the couch.



<b>				 BECKY
</b>
		    And this woman is a writer! 

		    That's what everyone writes at 

		    the beginning of letters to 

		    strangers.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    I know that.  You think I don't 

		    know that? "I know that's a 

		    dumb way to begin, but it's the 

		    only way I can think of to 

		    convey what happened to me the 

		    other night when I heard the 

		    two of you on the radio.  On 

		    the other hand, maybe I'm just 

		    losing my mind."



<b>				 BECKY
</b>
		    You are.  You're losing your 

		    mind.  What about Walter?



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    I'm going to marry Walter.  I 

		    just have to get this out of my 

		    system.



<b>				 BECKY
</b>
		    Right.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    I should say something in this 

		    about magic.



<b>				 BECKY
</b>
		    What?



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    I don't know.  I mean, what if 

		    I never meet him? What if this 

		    man is my destiny and I never 

		    meet him?



<b>				 BECKY
</b>
		    Your destiny can be your doom.  

		    Look at me and Rick.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
			   (typing some more)

		    "I want to meet you..."



	Cary Grant says: "How about the top of the Empire State 

	Building?"



<b>				 BECKY
</b>
		    "On top of the Empire State 

		    Building at sunset on 

		    Valentine's Day."



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New 

		    York with Walter, I can squeeze 

		    it in.



	She types in Becky's idea.



	Then she takes the piece of paper out of the typewriter, 

	smashes it into a ball and tosses it up in the air and 

	into Becky's lap.



<b>				 BECKY
</b>
		    You want to hear about destiny? 

		    If my husband hadn't gone on a 

		    diet, which caused me to leave 

		    him, I would never have been on 

		    that flight to Miami, and met 

		    Rick, and ended up having sex 

		    in the bathroom of a 727 with 

		    that nob you slide that says 

		    "vacant-occupied, vacant-

		    occupied, vacant-occupied" --

			   (she shudders in 

			    ecstasy, then pulls 

			    herself together)



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    You never told me you left your 

		    husband because he went on a 

		    diet.



<b>				 BECKY
</b>
			   (nods; after a beat)

		    He lost all the weight... 

		    there.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    That's impossible.  A guy can't 

<b>		    --
</b>


<b>				 BECKY
</b>
		    Can too.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    No.



<b>				 BECKY
</b>
		    Yes.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    And then you left him? He lost 

		    weight there and you left him?



<b>				 BECKY
</b>
		    Plus he fell in love with a 

		    temp.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Listen to this, I love this 

		    part --



	Deborah Kerr says: "It's now or never." And Cary Grant 

	says: "We'd be fools to let happiness pass us by." 

	Deborah Kerr: "Winter must be cold for those with no 

	warm memories."



	Becky and Annie with tears rolling down their faces.



<b>				 BECKY
</b>
		    Men never get this movie.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    I know.



<b>				 BECKY
</b>
		    Do you think at the end of the 

		    movie when she's in the 

		    wheelchair they can still do 

		    it?



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    I always wondered about that 

		    too.



	As Becky reaches for a Kleenex.

	A Kleenex being pulled from a box.  Sam is giving it to

	A beat while Jonah calms down.



<b>				 JONAH

</b>
		    What was?

		    You're worried we're going to 

		    be all right.  We're going to 

		    be all right.

			   (Sam gives Jonah a 

			    squeeze)

		    I remember sometimes you'd have 

		    nightmares as a baby.  Your mom 

		    would hold you and rock you and 

		    sing you a song.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    Bye bye blackbird.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Is that what she used to sing?



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    I miss her.

			   (beat)

		    What do you think happens to 

		    someone after they die?



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    I don't know.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    Like do you believe in heaven?



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    I never did.  Or the whole idea 

		    of an afterlife.  But I don't 

		    know any more.  I have these 

		    dreams about... your mom... and 

		    we have long talks about... 

		    about you, and how you are, 

		    which she sort of knows but I 

		    tell her anyway.  So what is 

		    that? It's sort of an afterlife, 

		    isn't it?



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    I'm starting to forget her.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    I know.  But she's here, Jonah.  

		    Because I have you.  And as 

		    long as I have you, I have your 

		    Mom.



	Hold on the two of them as music begins.  Bye Bye 

	Blackbird.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    I... uh... have a date with 

		    someone Friday night.

	Sam sits at a table.  Nursing a beer.  A little nervous.

	Jonah peeks up over the top of the desk to check if the 

	coast is clear and is sickened to see them locked in a 

	kiss.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    Oh God, it's major.  He's 

		    kissing her on the lips.  I 

		    have to stop this.

		    Come on, Jonah --

</b>
		    Do something --



<b>	ON JONAH
</b>


<b>				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
</b>
		    Jonah, you can't butt in here.

</b>
		    Yes, I can.



	He hangs up the phone and SCREAMS.

	It's Walter.

</b>
		    Miss Scarlett.  In the broom

<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
			   (to Becky)

		    I gotta go.  I'll see you at

		    I thought I saw a black widow 

		    spider.



	Sam looks at Victoria, shrugs.  Back to Jonah.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    What are you doing up?



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    I was thirsty.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    There's a bathroom upstairs.



<b>				 JONAH

		    The water tastes better in the

</b>
		    That's true.  Why is that?

<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Becky heard this woman on the 

		    radio complaining about this 

		    guy she was sure was Rick, 

		    which meant he was cheating on 

		    her.  She was completely 

		    hysterical.  Then it turned out 

		    the woman lived in Duluth.



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    That doesn't make any sense.

		    I just called for a second.

</b>
		    Long enough to call Victoria a 

		    ho.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    It's a short word.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    This is not a joke.  Thank God 

		    Victoria doesn't know.  It 

		    would really have hurt her 

		    feelings.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
			   (really getting into

</b>
		    This is Captain Foster 

		    welcoming you aboard Flight 132 

		    to Seattle.  Our flying time 

		    today...



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Do you believe that any lie is 

		    a betrayal? That's what Harold 

		    Pinter says, but it seems to me 

		    it's a very harsh way of 

		    drawing the line.



	Annie turns back to the window, leaving the seatmate, 

	who in any case doesn't speak English, completely 

	mystified.

	Jonah is standing out of the way at a departure gate, 

	watching Sam as Victoria checks in for a flight bound 

	for Minneapolis.



<b>				 VICTORIA
</b>
			   (turning to Jonah)

		    Can I bring something back for 

		    you? A souvenir?

			   (to Sam)

		    Does he like those little snow 

		    scenes?

			   (to Jonah)

		    You know -- you shake them up 

		    and the snow floats down?



	Sam looks at Jonah, threateningly.  Be nice or else.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
			   (extremely polite)

		    Sure.  I'd really like that.  

		    Thank you so much.



<b>				 VICTORIA
</b>
		    Well...



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    I think they're announcing your 

		    flight.



	Sure enough, passengers are starting to board.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    He's ten.



<b>				 VICTORIA
</b>
			      (he's good at it)

		    He's good at it.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    I read an article about this

<b>		    ...
</b>


<b>				 VICTORIA
</b>
		    I read the same article...



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    It takes time --



<b>				 VICTORIA
</b>
		    Absolutely.  When I come back, 

		    maybe the two of us should 

		    spend some time together, on 

		    our own.  What do you think?



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Sure.  Sure.



	Victoria waves goodbye and starts toward the jetway.  

	As Sam watches her go, Jonah looks at him, sticks his 

	finger in his mouth and pretends to gag.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
			   (impatiently)

		    Jonah, this isn't fair.  You 

		    don't know Victoria.  I hardly 

		    know her myself.  She is, in 

		    fact, a mystery to me.  She 

		    tosses her hair a lot.  Why 

		    does she do this? I have no 

		    idea.  Is it a twitch? Does 

		    she need a haircut? Should she 

		    use barrette so it doesn't 

		    keep falling in her face? 

		    These are things that I'm 

		    willing to get to the bottom 

		    of, and that is why I am dating 

		    her.  That is all I am doing.  

		    I am not marrying her.  Can you 

		    appreciate the difference? 

		    That's what single people do, 

		    they try people on and they see 

		    if they fit.  But nobody fits 

		    perfectly, everyone is an 

		    adjustment.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    Was Mom an adjustment?



<b>				 SAM
</b>
			   (complete exasperation)

		    I'm never going to meet anyone 

		    who's going to measure up to 

		    your mom in your eyes? What do 

		    you think? There's a perfect 

		    woman walking around out there?



	At that moment, Annie emerges from the jetway right next 

	to the one Victoria went into and comes toward us.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    There's no such thing as a 

		    perf --



	Sam sees Annie immediately, and is instantly struck by 

	her looks, her fluidity, her poise.



	Annie walks right toward Sam, right past him, inches 

	from him, not noticing him as she looks for the exit.  

	Sam continues to stare at her.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
			   (to himself, referring 

			    to Annie)

		    God, she's beautiful.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
			   (unaware he's talking 

			    about Annie)

		    Victoria? She's okay.



	Sam and Jonah start toward the exit, Sam trying not to 

	lose sight of Annie.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    Dad, I was talking to Jessica 

		    about reincarnation, and she 

		    thinks that probably you knew 

		    Annie in another life.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
			   (completely distracted)

		    Who is Annie?



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    The one who wrote us.



	Sam is preoccupied with Annie.  She takes a turn that he 

	doesn't expect.  He's having trouble keeping up, because 

	he has to wait for Jonah.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
			   (continuing)

		    But Jessica says you and Annie 

		    never got together in that 

		    life, and your hearts are like 

		    puzzles with parts out of them 

		    and when you get together the 

		    puzzle's complete.



	He's lost Annie in the crowd.  She's nowhere in sight.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    God dammit.



	A beat, then Sam heads off to the exit.  Jonah follows.  

	As they walk into the distance --



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    The reason I know this and you 

		    don't is that I'm younger and 

		    purer so I'm more in touch with 

		    cosmic forces.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    I sincerely hope you are not 

		    going to marry Jessica.

	Suddenly she hears a HORN HONKING behind her.  She looks 

	into the rear-view mirror and sees Sam and Jonah in

	Recognizing Sam from Wheedle's picture, Annie panics and

	Annie watching.  This is it.  No chickening out this time.



	She's come three thousand miles, told lies, the whole

	Sam and Jonah start toward the gate to the dock.



	Annie starts to cross the street, gathering courage and 

	rightness with every step.



	But she STOPS DEAD WHEN SHE SEES:



<b>	SUZY
</b>


	who we remember from eighteen months ago, appearing at 

	the gate to the marina -- waving, smiling a mile wide -- 

	beckoning Sam and Jonah home like a military wife whose 

	boys have just come back from the front.  Sam and Jonah 

	are overjoyed to see her.  Jonah breaks into a run, 

	nearly leaping into Suzy's waiting arms -- as Sam brings 

	up the rear, picking up Jonah's sodas which he dropped 

	when he started running.



<b>	ON ANNIE
</b>


	She comes to a standstill, in the middle of the street.  

	In shock.  The scene in front of her is too horrible to 

	bear.



<b>	ANNIE'S POV - GATE TO MARINA
</b>


	Sam catches up.  Suzy -- no less beautiful and vivacious 

	than she was before -- tousles Jonah's hair, kisses Sam 

	and hugs them both.



<b>	ON SAM, JONAH AND SUZY.
</b>


<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    God, it's wonderful to see you.  

		    Where's Greg?



<b>				 SUZY
</b>
		    He's over at the boat show.  

		    He'll be by later.

			   (she looks around)

		    It's so beautiful here.



<b>	ANNIE
</b>


	There is such apparent warmth, and joy, and love about 

	this homecoming that she forget where she is -- in the 

	middle of the street.  A car HORN blares at her... all 

	she can do is stare at the nightmare that has unfolded.  

	She starts to back away -- and that's when she sees --



<b>	A TAXICAB
</b>


	coming right at her, horn BLARING, tires SQUEALING.  

	Annie starts to jump to the other lane but there's a van 

	bearing down from the opposite direction.  She steps 

	back to the middle line.



	The cab goes into a skid.  Annie freezes.



	Sam heard the noise and turns to see what's going on.  

	The cab comes SCREECHING right at the CAMERA.



	Annie screams.



	The cab stops inches from her body.  The van in the 

	other oncoming lane fishtails to a stop as well.



<b>	ON SAM
</b>


	responding.  He runs from the gate toward the near-

	accident.



<b>	ON THE CAB DRIVER
</b>


	getting out of the cab, as other people gawk from the 

	sidewalk.



<b>				 DRIVER
</b>
		    Lady, what the hell are you 

		    doing?



	Annie, still in shock from her brush with disaster, 

	hears the Cabbie but doesn't respond.  Stunned, she 

	turns to see Sam on the other side of the street.  Their 

	eyes meet.  Sam stops, realizing it's the woman he saw 

	in the airport.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Hello.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Hello.



	Annie, totally mortified and humiliated by everything 

	that's happened, bolts for her car.



	Sam wants to run after her -- but there's traffic is 

	coming past and he can't cross the street.  Annie gets 

	into her car, starts and pulls away.  Sam stands there, 

	deflated.

		    So he can't write.  Big deal.  

		    I mean, verbal ability is a 

		    highly overrated thing in a 

		    guy, and our pathetic need for 

		    it is what gets us into so much 

		    trouble.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
			   (with resolve)

		    I'm going to run back to 

		    Walter's arms, if he's still 

		    have me.



<b>				 BECKY
</b>
		    What about the letter?



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    It doesn't mean anything.  It 

		    was written before I went out 

		    there.  Before the ho.



	She puts the letter on an ashtray, takes a match and 

	lights it.  They both watch it burn.

</b>


	A fire is blazing in the wood-burning stove.  Suzy is 

	sitting with her husband Greg and Sam.  Jonah is in 

	evidence, curled up on the couch under some blankets, 

	asleep.  On the table near the couch is red construction 

	paper for valentines, doilies, magic markers, etc.



<b>				 SUZY
</b>
		    You saw her in the airport and 

		    then here?



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    I tried to talk to her...

			   (he shrugs)

		    It was like I knew her.  Weird.



<b>				 GREG
</b>
		    Well, at least you're out there 

		    seeing people again.  That's 

		    terrific.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Well, just one really.



<b>				 SUZY
</b>
		    How's Jonah taking it?



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    It'll take him a while to come 

		    around.  A month ago he called 

		    one of those radio call-in 

		    shows and told them I needed a 

		    wife --



<b>				 SUZY
</b>
			   (charmed)

		    You're kidding --



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Now that I'm seeing someone, 

		    it's a whole other thing.



<b>	ON JONAH
</b>


	he's not asleep after all.  He's been listening all 

	along.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    He's become obsessed with 

		    some woman who wrote me --



<b>				 GREG
</b>
		    Are you serious?



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    She wants to meet me at the top 

		    of the Empire State Building.



<b>				 SUZY
</b>
		    It's a little derivative.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    What do you mean?



<b>				 SUZY
</b>
		    "An Affair To Remember." Did 

		    you ever see it? Cary Grant 

		    and Deborah Kerr.  Before that 

		    it was called "Love Affair With 

		    Irene Dunne And Charles Boyer."



<b>				 GREG
</b>
		    Women love this movie.



	On Jonah, listening.



<b>				 SUZY
</b>
		    They met at the Empire State 

		    Building, only they didn't.  

		    Never mind.



<b>				 GREG
</b>
		    What kind of person would write 

		    to someone they heard on the 

		    radio?



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    I got hundreds of letters from 

		    women all over the country --



<b>				 GREG
</b>
		    Desperate women --



<b>				 SUZY
</b>
		    Just because someone's looking 

		    for a nice guy doesn't make 

		    them desperate.



<b>				 GREG
</b>
		    How about rapacious and love-

		    starved?



<b>				 SUZY
</b>
		    No.



<b>				 GREG
</b>
		    It is easier to be killed by a 

		    terrorist --



<b>				 SUZY
</b>
		    It is not --



<b>				 GREG
</b>
		    Right, right.



	Suzy's irritated.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Anyway, Victoria's nice.



<b>				 SUZY
</b>
		    Would you follow her through an 

		    airport?



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Look, I met somebody.  She's 

		    good, and capable and smart.  

		    We hit it off.  We can't spend 

		    your life chasing after 

		    fantasies.



	Jonah is devastated by the realization that his dad is 

	serious about Victoria.

</b>
		    Hi.

</b>
		    Hi.

			   (a beat)

		    So far so good.  So.  What

		    school.  Shirley Votypka, the 

		    first girl I ever felt up.  

		    Health.  What about health? 

		    Did you know that eating six

		    Shhhh --

		    You're going to miss the train.

</b>
		    What are your plans in New

</b>
		    We're going to the Rainbow Room

</b>
		    I love the symphony.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
			   (cheerfully)

		    I hate it.

			   (she stands to go, 

			    starts toward the 

			    elevator)

		    I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I 

		    feel happy.  This is right.  

		    This is real.  Everything else 

		    is what happens when you watch 

		    too many movies and completely 

		    lose sight of what counts.

			   (as she steps into 

			    elevator)

		    Please don't tell anyone about

</b>


	JONAH is watching with his little girlfriend JESSICA, 

	who's crying.



<b>				 JESSICA
</b>
			   (weeping)

		    This is the best movie I've 

		    ever seen in my life.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    I don't get it.



<b>				 JESSICA
</b>
		    You have to go to her, Jonah.  

		    You have to find her.



	Jonah nods.  But he isn't sure how he's going to do it.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    Do you know how much it costs 

		    to go to New York?



<b>				 JESSICA
</b>
		    Nobody knows.  It changes 

		    practically every day.  How 

		    much money do you have?



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    Eighty dollars.



<b>				 JESSICA
</b>
		    I have forty-two.  So that 

		    would definitely cover 

		    taxicabs, I think.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    But how am I going to get 

		    there?



<b>				 JESSICA'S MOTHER
</b>
		    Honey, I'm going out for a few 

		    minutes.

			   (sticking her head in 

			    the door to the living 

			    room)

		    Could you keep an eye on things 

		    out front till I get back?



	Jessica looks over at Jonah.



<b>				 JESSICA
</b>
		    Sure.



<b>	INT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - TRAVEL AGENCY OFFICE - DAY
</b>


	Jessica is working on the computer.  She punches Jonah's 

	name into it.



<b>				 JESSICA
</b>
		    Do you want an aisle or a 

		    window seat?



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    Window.



<b>				 JESSICA
</b>
		    Do you want a fruit plate?



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    I don't know.  Do I?



<b>				 JESSICA
</b>
			   (shrugs)

		    I'd rather die than eat on an 

		    airplane.

			   (beat)

		    I'm telling them you're twelve 

		    so you can fly unaccompanied 

		    and they won't make you be 

		    carried around by a stewardess 

		    and everything.



	Jonah nods.



	Now Jessica takes a ticket form out of the desk and 

	starts to fill it out for Jonah.



<b>	EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - TIFFANY'S - A SCULPTED GLASS HEART

</b>


	formed by two dancers bending over backwards, awash in 

	pink light and spotlighted in white.



	Walter and Annie are among a few other people -- couples 

	mostly -- looking in the windows.  Each one a variation 

	on the heart motif.  They move to a window -- "Broken 

	Heart" -- burnished metal, with tow cherubs flying out 

	of the wound in the middle.



<b>	ON WALTER AND ANNIE'S REFLECTION
</b>


	in the Broken Heart window.



	They're both in their own worlds.  Then they both start 

	to speak at once.  They stop.  Annie looks at Walter.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    You go.



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    Ever since Christmas, you've 

		    been different.  Kind of 

		    distracted, distant.  But I 

		    feel like you're coming back 

		    from wherever you were.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    I am.

			   (she smiles at him)

		    I was just... I just got... I 

		    think I got nervous.  It's 

		    normal, right? Don't you ever 

		    feel nervous about, you know?



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    What?



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    About forever.



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    No.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Well, I did.  And you know what 

		    I think? I think that it was 

		    almost... too perfect.



<b>	INT. FIRST FLOOR - TIFFANY'S - DAY
</b>


	As Annie and Walter walk through the jewelry department 

	to the elevator.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    I started to wonder whether we 

		    were the human equivalent of 

		    two rights making a wrong, you 

		    know?



	Walter has no idea what she means, but he's completely 

	good-natured about it.



<b>	INT. THIRD FLOOR TIFFANY'S - DAY
</b>


	Annie and Walter are walking around the floor, followed 

	by a SALESWOMAN who is carrying a large white card on 

	which she is noting their selections.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    It was like kismet but not, if 

		    you see what I mean.



	Walter's brow furrows slightly.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
			   (continuing)

		    You have to grow up.  You can't 

		    have all these adolescent 

		    dreams about how exciting your 

		    life is going to be --



	Walter starting to look puzzled.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
			   (continuing)

		    Don't hate me but I love this 

		    pattern.



<b>			    	 WALTER
</b>
		    You couldn't.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    I do.



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    It's just like my grandmother's 

		    china.



<b>				 SALESWOMAN
</b>
		    How many place settings should 

		    I put down?



<b>				 ANNIE &amp; WALTER
</b>
		    Ten.



	Walter beams at her.



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    Exactly.  Eight is too few and 

		    twelve is too many.



	The SALESWOMAN writes a "10" on the big sheet of paper.



<b>	INT. FIRST FLOOR - TIFFANY'S - DAY
</b>


	As Annie and Walter come out of the elevator on the 

	ground floor and WALTER stops for a moment at the 

	Jewelry Repair department, reappears with a little blue 

	Tiffany's box he gives to Annie.



	Annie opens it.



	Inside is a lovely antique diamond ring.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Walter.



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    It was my mother's.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    It's so beautiful.  It's just 

		    what I would have picked out if 

		    I'd had every ring in the world 

		    to choose from.

			   (as she slips the ring 

			    onto her finger)

		    You see what I mean.  There are 

		    people who would like a 

		    relationship to be full of 

		    surprises, but I am not one of 

		    them.

			   (as she starts out the 

			    door with Walter 

			    behind, thinking about 

			    what she has just 

			    said)

		    Surprises are highly overrated.



	As they go out the door to:



<b>	EXT. FIFTH AVE.  - DAY
</b>


	As they start down the street and go off into the 

	distance.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
			   (continuing)

		    Promise me something, Walter.  

		    Promise me you will never have 

		    a surprise party for me.  Ever.  

		    You know what happens, you walk 

		    in the door in some horrible 

		    sweater you put on that morning, 

		    and there are hundreds of people 

		    in their best clothes shouting 

		    "Surprise!"

	Sam's got a suitcase on the bed, packing.  Jonah is 

	standing in the doorway, watching.



	He goes to his desk looking for something but can't find 

	it.  He tries a few drawers.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Have you seen my wallet?



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    It might be in the kitchen.



	Sam doesn't remember leaving it in the kitchen.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    I'm only going to be away one 

		    night, okay, and Clarise will 

		    be here.  You'll have a swell 

		    time.  You'll watch a little 

		    Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm 

		    Street 12, I'll never know.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    Are you going with her?

		    This is the one I like.

<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    I don't care who you like.  

		    It's who I like.  But the truth 

		    is you're never going to like 

		    anyone because it isn't your 

		    mother.



	Sam throws a pair of socks into the suitcase.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
			   (yelling)

		    Fine.  I won't say anything.  

		    You can marry Count Dracula.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Thank you, Jonah.  But the 

		    point is, I am not asking 

		    permission.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
			   (yelling)

		    What's wrong with Annie?

			   (emphasizing every

		    Shut up.



	Jonah appears at the doorway.

</b>
		    Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never

	Sam looks in the bathroom: no Jonah.  In the main cabin.  

	The back deck.  Out onto the docks.  Looking all up and 

	down.  Clarise coming down the deck -- she's apparently

<b>	EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - AFTERNOON
</b>


	It looks magnificent in the waning afternoon light.



<b>				 CABBIE'S VOICE
</b>
		    There it is.



	We are watching from:



<b>	INT. A TAXICAB
</b>


	where Jonah, with his head out the window, regards the 

	building with awe.



<b>				 CABBIE
</b>
		    What are you gonna do there, 

		    spit off the top?



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    No.  I'm gonna meet...

			   (trying to figure out 

			    what to call her)

		    my mother.



<b>	INT. RAINBOW ROOM - DUSK
</b>


	Walter and Annie walking toward their table with the 

<b>	MAITRE D'.
</b>


	Annie sits down, looks at the view.  Walter starts to 

	sit, revealing a spectacular view of the EMPIRE STATE 

	BUILDING directly behind him.  Annie's smile fades.



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    Is something wrong.



	Annie shakes her head.



<b>				 MAITRE D'
</b>
		    May I get you a drink?



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    Some champagne?



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Fine, fine.



	Walter glances back over his shoulder.



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    Beautiful view, isn't it?



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Walter, there's something I 

		    have to tell you --



<b>	EXT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - DUSK
</b>


	As Sam rushes out of the terminal.  Desperate.



	A cab pulls up.  Sam bolts to the head of the line and 

	muscles his way into the cab.  The other people in line 

	are irate.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Sorry, this is an emergency.



	The cab pulls out to a chorus of verbal abuse.



<b>				 SAM (V.O.)
</b>
		    Empire State Building.



<b>	INT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING LOBBY - DUSK
</b>


	Jonah, carrying his backpack, walks through the majestic 

	lobby and follows the arrow to the Observation Deck.



<b>	EXT. TOP OF EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - HELICOPTER SHOT - DESK
</b>


	Looking down on the observation deck.  The city below.  

	The tiny figure of Jonah walks into the middle of the 

	deck.  Looks around.



<b>	EXT. 59TH STREET BRIDGE - DUSK
</b>


	Sam's cab speeds across the bridge and into Manhattan, 

	heading for the Empire State Building.



<b>	INT. TOP OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - DUSK
</b>


	Jonah is going to take the bull by the horns.  He walks 

	up to a likely-looking WOMAN.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    Hi, I'm Jonah.  Are you Annie?



<b>				 WOMAN #1
</b>
		    No.

			   (smiles at him)

		    I'm Cynthia.



	He spies another unattached woman.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    Excuse me, are you Annie?



<b>	EXT. RAINBOW ROOM - DUSK
</b>


	A helicopter shot of Annie talking animatedly to Walter.



	And pull back to reveal that the Rainbow Room is 

	actually being seen by Jonah through a viewscope in:



<b>	EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING OBSERVATION DECK - DUSK INTO 
</b>
<b>	NIGHT
</b>


	Jonah is looking through the viewfinder.  He turns 

	around, forlorn.  He takes off his backpack and is about 

	to sit down next to it when Sam bolts into the 

	observation deck.



	Jonah leaps into his arms.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    You're my family.  You're all 

		    I've got.  What if something 

		    happened to you?



	Sam's eyes well up.  Jonah starts to cry.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    What if I couldn't get to you?



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    I was scared of what you were 

		    gonna do.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    When I found you?



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    If I didn't go.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Listen, have I ever done 

		    anything really stupid?



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    No.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    I mean, so far, have I screwed 

		    it up for you?



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    No.



	The two of them hold each other tight.  After a beat:



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    I can't believe you flew first 

		    class.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    It was all they had.



<b>	INT. RAINBOW ROOM - NIGHT
</b>


	Annie and Walter.  There's champagne in their glasses, 

	but neither of them has drunk a drop.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    I don't know what to say about 

		    it, Walter.  It was a form of 

		    temporary insanity.  But I had 

		    to tell you about it because --



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
			   (matter-of-fact)

		    -- it was a betrayal.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It 

		    was just...



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    So what happened?



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    I told you.  Nothing --



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    At the top of the Empire State 

		    Building --



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    I'm not at the top of the 

		    Empire State Building.  I'm 

		    here.



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    Not really.

			   (beat)

		    Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's 

		    leave that out of it.  I don't 

		    want to be someone you're 

		    settling for.  I don't want to 

		    be someone anyone settles for.

			      (beat)

		    I have a life insurance policy,  

		    I'm fully invested in growth 

		    stocks, I have a paid 

		    subscription to Home Rox 

		    Office, I have no sexual 

		    diseases, I have been steadily 

		    employed in a part of the 

		    economy that isn't soft, I have 

		    expectation in the way of 

		    inherited wealth, I dress 

		    nicely, I am a member of the 

		    private sector, an independent 

		    voter, I don't watch Monday 

		    Night Football, the only thing 

		    wrong with me is that I am 

		    allergic to wheat, 

		    strawberries, penicillin, 

		    pollen, nuts and wool.  There 

		    are plenty of women who see me 

		    as the brass ring.  If you 

		    don't -- marriage is hard 

		    enough without bringing such 

		    low expectations into it, isn't 

		    it?



	Annie is nodding.  She wipes a tear from her face.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve 

		    you.



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    I think that's what I'm saying.



	Slowly, gingerly, Annie slips the engagement ring off 

	her finger and hands it to Walter.



	No bitterness here.  Both of them trying to be gentle 

	with each other.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    You okay?



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    Yes.

			   (beat)

		    Some people will do anything to 

		    get out of going to a symphony.



	This breaks the tension.  Both of them smiles.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Oh!



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    What?



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Look!



	Walter turns to look over his shoulder at what Annie 

	sees:



<b>	THE LIGHTS HAVE JUST GONE ON ON THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING 
</b>
<b>	VALENTINE LIGHTS:
</b>


	A huge pink and white heart.



	Walter turns back to Annie.



<b>				 WALTER
</b>
		    Go for it.



	And as Annie's heart leaps and she's about to bolt.



<b>							CUT TO:
</b>


<b>	EXT. WEST 50TH STREET - NIGHT
</b>


	As Annie comes out to the street and hails a cab.



	As it screeches off toward Fifth Ave.



<b>	INT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT
</b>


	The lights are on all over the city.



	The crowd has thinned out considerably.  Jonah and Sam 

	are among the last people left.  They gaze out at the 

	twinkling lights and the ever-darkening sky.



<b>				 ELEVATOR OPERATOR
</b>
		    Last call.  Closing time.



	Jonah looks at Sam.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    This is pretty dumb, wasn't 

		    it?



	Sam shrugs.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Big deal.



	After a beat.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Maybe we'll get a dog when we 

		    get back.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    Okay.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    What do you mean, okay? 

		    Wouldn't you like a dog?



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    Sure.



	Sam puts his arm around him, they start toward the 

	elevator.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Let's go home.



<b>	EXT. FIFTH AVE - NIGHT
</b>


	Annie's cab stuck in traffic.



	As Annie gets out of the cab.



	She's breaking into a hard run toward the Empire State 

	Building.



<b>	INT. LOBBY OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>


	Annie sprints in and over to Information Booth.



<b>				 INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON
</b>
		    Sorry, ma'am, but the elevators 

		    are closed.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
			   (out of breath)

		    No.  Please.  I really need to 

		    get up there.



<b>				 INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON
</b>
		    We're closing up.  No more runs 

		    tonight.



	Annie takes a deep breath.  She's hit the end of the 

	road.  She turns to go but then turns back.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
			   (out of breath)

		    Listen, can I just take a look? 

		    Maybe... maybe... There's 

		    someone I was supposed to 

		    meet... He's probably not 

		    there, but if I don't at least 

		    look I'll always wonder about 

		    it.



	The Information Booth Person looks at her.



<b>				 INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON
</b>
		    Cary Grant, right?



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    You know that movie?



<b>				 INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON
</b>
		    One of my wife's favorites.



<b>	INT. TOP OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING
</b>


	After a few beat the elevator door opens on a very 

	empty platform.



<b>				 ELEVATOR MAN
</b>
		    Sorry, ma'am.  Empty.



	Annie slowly walks out.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Can I take a minute?



<b>				 ELEVATOR MAN
</b>
		    Go ahead.



	She sighs.  Heads for the telescopes.  Looks out at the 

	twinkling lights below.



	She casually turns the telescope and suddenly sees 

	something on the floor.



	Jonah's Seattle Mariners backpack.



	She picks it up.  She realizes that it might be... 

	could be... and opens it.  Inside is a toothbrush and 

	Jonah's teddy bear.  As she takes out the bear the other 

	elevator DINGS.



	Annie looks up as Jonah and Sam exit the elevator.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    I left it near the...



	And they stop.  There she is.  There they are.  Sam 

	can't believe it.  It's the mystery woman.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    It's you.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    It's me?



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    The one in the street.  I 

		    chased after you.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    Are you Annie?



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Yes.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
			   (confused)

	    You're Annie too?



	She smiles awkwardly.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
			   (indicating the 

			    backpack)

		    Is this yours?



	Jonah walks over to her.  He puts his hand out.  She 

	shakes it solemnly.



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    I'm Jonah.

			   (nodding back to Sam)

		    That's my dad.  His name is 

		    Sam.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Hi, Jonah.  Sam.

			   (indicating the teddy 

			    bear)

		    And who is this?



<b>				 JONAH
</b>
		    Howard.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Howard.



	Sam nods.  Smiling.  Starting to put it all together.  

	Annie smiles.  Still nervous.  No one knows what to do 

	next.  Just then, one of the elevator operators CLEARS 

<b>	HIS THROAT.
</b>


<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    We better go.



	Annie nods.



	Sam holds out his hand.



<b>				 SAM
</b>
		    Shall we?



	Annie slips her hand into his.  It feels comfortable, 

	natural, right.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    Sam?



	He looks at her.



<b>				 ANNIE
</b>
		    It's nice to meet you.



	On Annie.



	On Sam.



	On Jonah.  He makes a triumphant little double-fist 

	gesture to himself as the elevator doors close.



<b>	EXT. THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>


	WE SEE THE BUILDING from above, all lit up, a romantic 

	confection, the world's largest Valentine.



	The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see the United States 

	spread out before us, with lights twinkling everywhere.



	And
