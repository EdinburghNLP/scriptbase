          EXT. RURAL SUBURBAN STREET - DAWN - PRESENT DAY
                         
           A 5-year old girl wearing pajamas wanders alone down the 
           street.
                         
                          FRANKIE
                          (BARELY AUDIBLE)
           Me-gan!
                         
           INT. PERIERA HOME - PRESENT DAY

           FRANKIE crawls through a dog door. She walks into the living
           room where the TV is on loud.
                         
           DEAN PERIERA, 30 years old, hefty, sleeps in a lazyboy.
                         
                          FRANKIE
                          (HUSHED)
           Daddydaddydaddy.
                         
           Frankie uses the footrest to crawl up onto her dad's belly.
                         
                          FRANKIE (CONT'D)
           Wake up Daddy.
                         
                          DEAN (WAKING)
           What time is it baby?
                         
           She sniffles. He notices.
                         
           EXT. PERIERA HOME - BACK/FRONT YARDS - PRESENT DAY
                         
           The back door opens and Dean carries Frankie to the yard. The
           first yellow rays of sunlight hit their faces.
                         
           He looks over the lawn, an empty bowl, water tin and a
           doghouse posting the name MEGAN. He peeks inside the
           doghouse. There's no one home. Dean moves to the fence. The
           gate is open.
                         
           Dean carries Frankie to the front yard. They look around.
                         
                          FRANKIE
           When's she going to get back?
                         
                          DEAN
           She probably just went out for a run.
           She'll be back soon because she's going
           to get thirsty.
                         
                          FRANKIE
           She's going to be thirsty?

                          DEAN
           You know what we should do? We should
           leave her bowl full of water and her dish
           full of food. Because she's gotta get
           hungry and thirsty sometime. You know?
                         
           Dean's optimism is infectious. Frankie nods slowly.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           Like me. I'm hungry. I'm so hungry I
           could eat your toes.
                         
           Dean pretends to gnaw at Frankie's toes. Breaks her sadness.

           CINDY PERIERA, 28, sleeps in bed. Sunlight spills through
           translucent yellow curtains into a small master bedroom.
                         
           Dean sets Frankie down on the bed, motions to her to be
           silent. He sniffs the air. She follows. They eye each other
           and pounce. Cindy wakes up with a gasp.
                         
                          CINDY
           I'm sleeping!
                         
                          DEAN
           We're hungry! We're going to eat you.
                         
           They pin her arms above her head and 'furber' her armpit.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           Don't laugh. Come on, don't laugh!
                         
           Cindy doesn't laugh, she screams.

           Cindy, nursing a weight-loss drink, scans through digital 
           photos on the computer. We see - family on vacation,
           Frankie's first day of school, Frankie and a black and white
           Border Collie mutt - Megan. Cindy exports the picture when...
           A tea kettle whistle blows.
                         
           Dean and Frankie sit at the table. He plays a song for
           Frankie on a ukulele. Cindy gets up, turns off the kettle.
                         
                          DEAN
           What happened to the flute?
                         
           Cindy pours the hot water into a bowl with instant oatmeal &
           raisins. She blows on the food and places it at the table.

           C'mon, eat, you can't be late today.
                         
           Frankie takes a tiny bite and makes a sour face.
                         
                          FRANKIE
           I don't like it...
                         
           Cindy turns on the faucet over a pile of dishes, returns to
           the computer to e-mail herself the missing dog flyer.
                         
                          DEAN
           Here... we can make it taste better.
                         
           Dean spoons the raisins out of her bowl onto the table.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           This is how a leopard eats.
                         
           He laps up his coffee like a cat. She mimics. Dean laughs.
                         
                          CINDY
           Come on Frankie, use a spoon. You know
           how to use a spoon.
                         
                          FRANKIE
           Lepers don't use spoons.
                         
                          DEAN (WHISPERS)
           Are you gonna listen to your mother? I
           think you better.
                         
           Frankie reluctantly takes a tiny bite. Her face sours and she
           lets the food fall out of her mouth and back in the bowl.
           Cindy returns to the dishes.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           How old are you?
                         
                          FRANKIE
           Five.
                         
                          DEAN
           Okay, eat five bites.
                         
           Dean gets up, goes to Cindy at the sink.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           We gotta get a dishwasher...
                         
           Tries to take the dish sponge away from her. She resists.

           She drops the sponge, dries her hands.
                         
                          CINDY
           Frankie! We're leaving in 15. Eat!
                         
           Frankie ignores her.
                         
                          CINDY (CONT'D)
           Alright...
                         
           She pulls Frankie out of her seat and carries her under one
           arm to the back room. Frankie protests.
                         
           Dean watches, shakes his head. He sees the computer on,
           Cindy's e-mail is still open. He shuts off the running water.
                         
           He scans through messages from a bunch of names of people
           Dean doesn't know. He sweats, clicks open a return message
           from a real estate company - apartment now available.

           We're gonna be late... look up.
                         
           Frankie is propped up on the sink. Cindy draws cat whiskers
           on her cheeks. Frankie tips her head back.
                         
           CINDY (softens) (cont'd)

           Cindy backs their minivan out of the garage. Frankie is
           strapped in her carseat. Dean comes up to the window, knocks.
           Cindy brakes. Dean hands Frankie her backpack.
                         
           DEAN (to Frankie)
           You be good today for Miss Alex, okay?
                         
           Frankie, dressed like a little leopard, nods.

                          CINDY
           ...Love you.
                         
           Dean pulls his head out of the window.
                         
                          DEAN
           Put your seat belt on.
                         
           She starts to back up.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           C'mon. What's the big deal?
                         
           Cindy does as she's told, looks over her shoulder, scrapes
           the curb.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)

           Cindy cranks the wheel straight, puts on the gas and burns
           down the road.
                         
           Dean stands there in his driveway, muttering to himself. He
           watches the car disappear down the street.
                         
           Another car, headed the opposite direction, barrels down the 
           road, past the Periera home.

           Cindy clicks the "print" button on a computer, moves to the
           printer. It spits out a "Missing Dog" flyer.
                         
           DR. SAM FEINBERG - handsome, well-groomed, unshakable
           confidence - appears at the door, with coffee.

           Feinberg walks away down the hallway.

           Dean drives with a beer in a koozie and a cigarette. He has a
           coughing fit, rolls down his window and spits.
                         
           CHARLEY - late 30s, hefty, African American - sits in the

           They talk about sex, women and broken fantasies. But Dean's 
           attention is on the side of the road, scanning the
           neighborhood for Megan. He whistles sharp and loud.

           the window. She slows down, waits for opposing traffic to
           pass, then pulls a wide u-turn. She rises up out of her seat
           to look at something.

           FOURTH OF JULY music recital. The Pre-K classes are lined up 
           on small bleachers. Led by their teacher, the kids sing "I'm

           Frankie, steps out of her line of pre-kindergarteners to see 
           if her parents are in the bleachers. She spots her father, 
           jumps a little, and wonders if he can see her.

           Dean sits alone, picks paint off his hands. He does not fully 
           watch the children - he watches the door for Cindy to enter. 
           He wonders where she is - every possible scenario passes
           through his mind. looks at the clock - 3:35.
                         
           Cindy arrives with haste, purse open, holding a big set of 
           keys in her right hand and a water bottle in her left. She
           props her sunglasses on her head, looks around for Frankie.
           She waves to her, but Frankie doesn't see her.
                         
           Dean spots Cindy by the base of the bleachers - relaxes. He
           picks up his jacket, puts it on his lap, making room for her.
                         
           She looks around for Dean, spots him near the top of the
           bleachers. Little waves. She climbs the crowded bleachers,
           stopping to talk with parents along the way. She comes up
           next to Dean, takes her purse off. They say "hi" but neither
           one makes eye contact. Dean takes the water bottle from her.

           Cindy shakes her head "no." She drops her keys into her

           at her. She concentrates on closing the clasp on her purse.

           She doesn't want to start crying. Dean gets visibly
           frustrated. He's sick of prying everything out of her.

           leg. He picks her up.
                         
                          DEAN
           Hey leopard. You be good now. You
           remember what to do when Pa snores?

           Cover his mouth and hold his nose.
                         
                          DEAN
           That's my girl. Gimme a squeezer.
                         
           Dean hugs her and she squeezes back as hard as her arms
           allow. Dean plays as if his neck was being pinched off. He
           sets her on the ground running back to the porch. She gets
           caught in the diameter of the sprinkler spray. She screams as
           the water chases her.
                         
                          JERRY
           It got you! Go right! OTHER RIGHT!
                         
           Dean and Cindy both laugh. Their eyes meet for the first time
           in days, maybe weeks. They exchange a brief smile, filled
           with mutual love, pride and respect - connected by their
           little girl. Frankie stands in front of Cindy, water drips
           from her bangs.
                         
                          CINDY
           Come on silly. Let's go in and get dry.
                         
                          FRANKIE
           I don't wanna take off my costume!
                         
                          CINDY
           You don't have to. Let's just go in.
                         
           Cindy leads Frankie with one hand and pulls Jerry's oxygen
           tank with the other. Jerry takes Frankie's free hand.
                         
           Dean smokes and watches... Cindy hold the screen open with
           her foot and maneuver father, tank and child inside. The
           screen door closes. Sammy barks at Dean through the screen
           door. He tugs his smoke, memories flood. He drifts...

           Dean comes inside from the cold. He tries to walk in quietly -
           not disturbing Jake who's watching TV in the back bedroom. He
           goes to say "hi" but decides he'd rather not disturb him.
                         
           Dean sits on the couch which he uses as a bed. He pulls his
           travelling bag from underneath the coffee table, digs around
           for a long sock where he keeps his money. He stuffs his day's
           pay ($45), in the sock with the rest of his $ (about $100).
                         
           In the kitchen, he opens the fridge. There is a pie tin with
           one last slice of pumpkin pie. Walks to Jake's room. Stands
           in the doorway. Jake doesn't acknowledge him.

           Dean is unsure. He proceeds, imbalanced down the stairs.
                         
           He makes it to the truck where Saned waits to help him get
           the boxes in. Dean can't quite manage a 30-pound, behind the
           back hand-off. He ends up spilling up the boxes and their
           contents all over the sidewalk. Saned gets pissed. Dean gets
           down on his hands and knees and packs up the boxes - quickly.

           the bills down on the dresser. Continues to arrange the
           things. He stares at a picture of old man and his wife.
                         
           ELLIPSE - A nurse wheels Walter down the hallway and
           introduces him to his new room.
                         
                          DEAN
           Wait up. We gotta do this right...
                         
           He takes the wheelchair from the nurse, wheels Walter out of
           the room, picks him out out of his wheelchair, and carries
           him back into the room across the threshold of his new home.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           You are gonna be the new stud in this 
           place.
                         
           Dean sets him down in a recliner, then gives him a tour of
           his room - tells him which drawer his socks are in, where put
           the aftershave, etc. Curtis pokes his head around the corner.
                         
                          CURTIS
           Boss says we gotta go. We gotta go.
                         
           Dean cuts the tour short, wishes the old man luck and tells
           him he'll come visit him someday. He backs out of the
           doorway, grabs his money off the dresser, and says goodbye.
           Dean turns and is frozen in his tracks. Something or someone
           makes his expression change to that of wonder, eyes fill with
           love... he puts the money in his pocket.

           around her mini van and directs her to open the back hatch.
           She presses the button from inside. Hatch opens. She gathers
           the stack of missing dog flyers in the seat next to her.

           mound as a marker. He stands over it, smoking a cigarette.
           Cindy looks on from the porch, arms hugging her body. Dean
           walks to her and wraps his arms around her. Her arms fall and
           move up to touch his side.

           Cindy searches her wallet, goes into her change purse.
                         
                          CINDY (CONT'D)

           Dean blows on a hot cup of coffee. Cindy moves fast, loads in
           the bags next to their luggage, slams the hatch closed and
           snatches the keys from Dean's hands.
                         
                          CINDY

           You're drivin'?
                         
           Cindy hops in the driver's seat. Dean rides on the end of the
           buggy and crashes it into the buggy corral. She fires up the
           engine and honks. He throws his hands up.

           Cindy drives the car along a windy, mountain road. Dean keeps
           a lidless cup of coffee from spilling.
                         
                          DEAN
           Alright, lead foot. It's not a race.
                         
           Cindy is zoned into the road. She turns off the radio.
                         
                          CINDY
           Isn't it funny how you can be driving for
           20 minutes and it feels like you've only
           been driving for 20 seconds. The time
           just gets swallowed up somewhere...
                         
           Dean places his hand on Cindy's hand that rests on the car
           seat. A small squeeze. She squeezes back. Dean looks at her
           with tenderness. Her eyes are on the road. She lifts her hand
           to the wheel. Dean reaches for the radio.
                         
                          DEAN
           Do you mind if I turn this back on?
                         
                          CINDY
           I was kind of enjoying the silence.
                         
                          DEAN
           Let's just see if there's something on...
                         
           He scans through the low stations.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           Anything? Fuck it.
                         
           He turns it off.

           That's better. You're right. It never
           gets to be just quiet. You know?
                         
           Cindy nods. Dean rolls down his window, spits his gum as far
           as he can. He rolls it back up.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           What are you thinking about?
                         
           Dean looks at Cindy, waiting for her to respond.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)

                          DEAN
           Where d'you get these?
                         
           Dean reaches for the glasses on top of Cindy's head. She
           feels the dangling tag - "woops." She tears off the tag and
           tosses the glasses on the dashboard.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           Try em' on.
                         
           Cindy shakes her head "no." Dean puts them on his face. He
           poses for Cindy. She grabs the glasses and puts them on. She
           looks at Dean. He holds in a chuckle.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           You look like your mom.
                         
           Cindy takes them off. Back on the dash.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           You get any snacks?
                         
                          CINDY
           There should be some fig newtons back
           there.
                         
           Dean unbuckles his seatbelt, crawls to the back of the van
           digs through the bags. Cindy can't see out of the rear-view.
                         
                          DEAN
           Which bag?

           Cindy enjoys a moment alone, straightens her back, crosses
           the dotted yellow lines and passes a car, then relaxes. Dean
           crawls back up to the front seat. They both eat a cookie.
                         
                          DEAN
           Mmm. These are good.
                         
           He offers her another one. She shakes her head.

           The car stops on the shoulder of the two lane highway. Cindy
           gets out of the car.

           On the side of the road, she stares into the woods. Cars pass
           behind her, headlights flood the night. She descends into the
           thicket until the sound of the highway is faint. Wind through
           the leaves. She drops her pants and pees. Something rustles
           and she looks into the woods.

           defensive position. TROY LEANER, his buddy, gets on top of
           him in the offensive position. Bobby looks up, sees Cindy by
           the door attempting to pop wheelies in her wheelchair.
                         
           Whistle blows! Bobby escapes the position and wraps Troy up
           in a double grapevine. Quickly pins him, stands up, takes off
           his ear guards, bumps fists. He walks over to Cindy.

           Glenda her plate. The meat breaks apart and half of it lands
           on the table cloth. A brownish-green oil.
                         
                          CINDY
           It's OK mom.

           Cindy picks up the fallen particles with her fork. Jerry's
           eyes burn into Glenda. She won't look at him.
                         
                          GLENDA
           Can I have your plate Dad?
                         
           He pushes it across the table an inch. Glenda lowers a slice
           onto Jerry's plate with a SPLAT. Jerry looks at his dinner.
           Glenda serves herself. Cindy cuts Gramma's meat with her fork
           and looks over at her dad. His face is turning beat-red...
                         
           Suddenly, Jerry pounds his fist into the mound of meatloaf,
           obliterating it. Particles of ground meat fly everywhere.
           Glenda won't look up, her shoulders tremble. Jerry raises his
           steaming fist. Bits of ground beef stick to his knuckles.
                         
                          JERRY

           minutes to make a meatloaf? I been up

           us needed a change? Did you ask for a
           change? Cindy? She doesn't ask for

           ask for a change, did you mom?...She
           can't hear! And I don't remember asking
           for a change. So, it was you, wasn't it?

           closes his eyes tight, trying to control himself. But the

           Cindy comes out, shirt stretched over her waist. Bobby sits
           up, asks her what's wrong? She can't look.

                          GRAMMA
           Cindy. Have you got a cigarette!
                         
                          CINDY
           Okay, shhh. But you gotta be quiet.
                         
           Cindy gets up and opens the window. She turns on the fan,
           digs in Gramma's purse, gets a cigarette and a lighter. Cindy
           walks to her gramma's door, sees Curtis walking away from the
           old man's room.
                         
           CURTIS (O.S.)
           Boss says we gotta go. We gotta go.
                         
           She starts closing the door, then sees Dean backing out of
           the old man's room. He puts a roll of money in his pocket,
           turns to leave and sees Cindy watching him.
                         
           DEAN (LOOKS DOWN AT HIS MONEY)
           I didn't just steal that.
                         
           Cindy doesn't know what this guy is talking about.
                         
           DEAN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
           You think I just stole that money?
                         
                          CINDY
           No.
                         
                          DEAN
           You do. No, you do. I know that you do.
           And the reason that I know that you do is
           - I have stolen money before... a lot of
           it. And I know what it feels like to have
           someone look at you like that...

           The way your lookin'. Just so you know, I
           have a job where I make money. Money that
           I can take girls out on dates with.

           Pack it up Periera. Bus is leaving.
                         
           Dean looks toward the door, then back at Cindy. He sees that
           he has kind of went to far with his rant.
                         
                          DEAN
           Can I give you my number or something.
                         
           He feels inside his shirt pocket, pulls out a business card.
           Finds a pen. Dean writes his name across the card. Hands it
           to Cindy.
                         
           DEAN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
           I'm Dean. Just call and you can ask for
           me. I'll get it.
                         
           Cindy looks down at the card, at his name. Then back up to
           him. Dean run out, chasing after his ride. He looking behind
           before he leaves. Cindy watches him go out the door.

           Door opens revealing Dean and Cindy holding groceries and
           suitcases. Dean flicks on the light, illuminating the Moon
           Room - a hotel room decorated like the lunar surface.
                         
                          DEAN
           Wow. Where are we?
                         
           He sets down the suitcases, transfixed by the room, a kid in
           a candy shop. Cindy moves to the small kitchen that looks
           like a control room. She makes herself a drink.

           Dean walks into the bright BATHROOM, turns on the shower, a
           sparse tinkle of water.
                         
           DEAN (yells out)
           I could piss harder than this!
                         
           The dual mirrors multiply his reflection. He looks at himself
           and removes his coffee-stained shirt. A neglected body. But
           something else distresses Dean. A fallen hair on the T-shirt
           he holds. He runs his hands through his hair, looks in horror
           at twelve fallen hairs in his palm. He washes them down the
           drain and leans to the mirror, inspecting his hairline.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)

           Cindy dials the telephone, drink in hand. Shirtless, Dean
           walks out of the BATHROOM with his empty palms open.
                         
                          DEAN
           Now watch.
                         
           He runs his hands through his hair then shows her his palms -
           three fallen hairs. His magic trick.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           See. I tol' ya. It's falling out!
                         
           Cindy ignores Dean who is mesmerized.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           Oooooooooh shiiiiiiit!
                         
           Cindy waves him away. Jerry picks up the line.

           Hi Dad. We're here... It's kind of crazy.
           I don't know, should I feel bad?
                         
           Dean trots back into the BATHROOM. He is screaming like a
           hyena.
                         
                          CINDY (CONT'D)

           Dean tosses his suitcase onto the circular spaceship bed,
           watches the graceful way it rebounds. He shoves the suitcase
           aside, falls backwards onto the bed. He sighs with pleasure.
           There is a box with a button next to the bed. He presses it.
           The bed rotates. He looks up at his spinning reflection in
           the mirror above the bed.
                         
           CINDY (O.S.)

           ...Frankie? ...What'd you and Pa eat?
           ...Was it cooked all the way through? No
           pink in there? ...
                         
           Dean walks up from behind, putting on a clean, white T-shirt.
           He snaps his fingers at Cindy. Cindy swipes his hand away
           with more force than necessary.
                         
                          CINDY (CONT'D)

           Dean paces, improvising a bedtime story. It comes from the
           well of creativity in him. Frankie loves to hear him talk.
           And he loves to make her happy. He finishes. She is happy.

           He walks into the living room, stretching the phone cord,
           grabs the remote and turns on the television - animal doc.
           Dean turns the channel. Tennis.

           Dean hangs up and returns to the living room. He changes the
           station. A porno. He turns the volume down and watches. He
           hears water running in the BATHROOM. CLICK. A show on space.

           Dean closes the door, remains in the BATHROOM, watches his

           The small shower presses them close. Dean's smile infects
           her. He leans over, they kiss. Brushing lips at first. Dean
           presses closer. Cindy pulls back and pivots him around until
           the stream of water catches his body. He leans his head back,
           the water pours over his hair and face. He places his hands
           on Cindy's hips and pulls her close to him. Cindy hands him a
           bar of soap. He builds a gentle lather. Cindy inches back,
           turns around. Dean lathers her back, slow and languid.

           He washes her shoulders and neck. His hands sculpt her body
           and move to her breasts. No longer washing her, but molding
           her. Cindy looks up. His hands move to her belly. He kneels
           down. Cindy reaches down and lifts him up by the arms. But
           Dean remains where he is. He begins, on his knees, to wash
           the entire surface of her left thigh, knee, calf, foot. Then
           he moves to her right foot and up her calf, knee and thigh.
           Cindy releases her breath. Then, Dean's hands move up between
           her legs.
                         
                          CINDY
           Okay.
                         
           Cindy grabs under his armpits. He refuses, but she wins. She
           pivots them around again. Standing in the stream of water,
           Cindy washes the soap off her body, eyes closed, head back.
           Dean reaches for her and follows with his fingertips the flow
           of water down the front of her body.
                         
                          CINDY (CONT'D)
           Give me the soap.
                         
           She forms a quick lather in her hands. She rubs it into his
           chest, her strong hands making circles of suds. Dean is a
           tranquil participant. She lifts up his left arm, scrubs his
           armpit, then his right. Her hands build a lather and wash his
           penis. Dean catches his breath.
                         
                          CINDY (CONT'D)
           Turn around.
                         
           Dean obeys. She continues wash his back, buttocks and legs
           and stops. Dean turns around to Cindy who holds a squirt of
           shampoo in her hands. She reaches up and scours his head.
                         
                          DEAN
           Getting thinner, isn't it?

           Cindy pivots him around into the water and rinses him.

           She pecks him on the lips.

           Ice dumps into an ice bucket. Music and laughter emanate from
           other rooms. Dean wears a hotel robe and carries a full
           bucket of ice. He swipes his key. A TEENAGE boy in a tuxedo
           shirt and swim trunks chases a girl in a bikini down the
           hallway behind him.

           He takes a big drink, sifts through cassettes in his bag. In

           She hears the music begin from the other room, knows the song
           - (Penny & the Quarters or Dynamite Four) It sounds really
           good right now. Drink in hand, she begins to sway to the
           rhythm. Dean peeks his head around the corner with a shit-
           eating grin. He starts to awkwardly dance to the music and
           make his way down the hallway to the bedroom.
                         
           It's been years since they danced in front of each other, and
           it makes them a little embarrassed to be doing it now. The
           closer they get to each other, the less they can be seen, the
           less they are exposed. Soon, they are slow dancing, still
           holding drinks. They don't feel as vulnerable now. The cotton
           on Dean's robe feels good to Cindy's fingertips, she traces
           invisible pictures on his back. Dean burrows his nose into
           Cindy's neck, inhales deeply.
                         
           There is a knock at the door. They both wish it would go
           away. It doesn't. 
                         
           DEAN (YELLS) (cont'd) 
           Coming!
                         
           Something about this makes Cindy laugh, Dean too. He backs
           away from her, slowly, as if pulled by some unseen force. The
           song continues as Dean opens the door and pays the ROOM 
           SERVICE MAN. Cindy sets the table.

           in the corner. Dean reaches - a locket.

           ...And then the opportunity comes, it
           presents itself to you, living and
           breathing in the flesh, and you puss out.

           Dean holds up the locket and stares at it, twirling. He opens
           the latch - sees a picture of the old man and his wife - 60
           years ago. Dean puts it in his pocket, finishes sweeping up.

           Still wearing his work clothes, Dean rides the train out of
           the city, pulls out the locket. Reads the inscription on the
           back - "you are my sunshine."
                         
           Dean gets off the train. Asks some people for directions.

           Dean walks to the old man's room. The door is open, lights
           are off, room is empty. All the furniture, pictures, gone -
           just an empty bed. Dean is at a loss for what to do. He hears
           the TV coming from across the hall. He knocks, waits, then
           opens Cindy's Gramma's door. She is lying in bed. Tries to
           recognize Dean. He pulls up a chair next to her.
                         
                          DEAN
           Hi. I was looking for your neighbor...
           the man who moved in last month. Across
           the hall. Do you know what happened to
           him?

                          DEAN
           What about the girl that was with you?

           Who?
                         
           The conversation moves in circles. Not much information is
           gained. Dean ends up just holding her hand.

           The bus drives away. Inside, Dean stands. He is a little
           down. He feels around in his pocket. Finds the locket. He
           puts it on. The bus comes to a stop. A few passengers get on.
           One of them is Cindy. Dean watches her pay her fare and move
           to the back of the bus without noticing him.
                         
           She finds a seat, pulls her hoodie low, anonymous. She
           underlines passages from a textbook using a highlighter. Dean
           is frozen. He gathers the courage to walk toward her. The
           moving bus throws his balance. He stands over her for a
           moment. Cindy senses somebody in her space. She looks up.
           Recognizes him, but can't place it.
                         
                          DEAN

           I just had a long talk with your
           gramma... is that, is that your gramma?
                         
           Cindy remembers him now - he's just dressed nicer - he
           doesn't look like a mover
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           I was looking for that old guy who moved
           across the hall, you know? Do you know
           what happened to him?

           I think he passed away.
                         
           Dean feels for the locket around his neck. He shakes his
           head.
                         
                          DEAN
           That's exactly what happened to my dog.
           My parents moved out of our house and
           three days later she was a goner.
                         
           He pulls the locket out from behind his shirt. He unclasps
           it. Shows her the pictures.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           He was so handsome, wasn't he? I was
           trying to give it back to him.
                         
           Cindy looks at it.
                         
                          CINDY
           She was pretty too..
                         
           Dean thinks about the old man. The bus drives.
                         
                          DEAN
           She must have been crazy.
                         
                          CINDY
           Why do you say that?
                         
                          DEAN
           Cause there's one thing I know... the
           prettier a girl is the more nuts she is.
           I mean, look at you... you must be
           insane.
                         
                          CINDY

           It's okay, I mean, I get it. It's not
           your fault.
                         
           Cindy pulls the chain to stop the bus.

           Dean looks back. He sees a bunch of houses that all look the
           same. They keep walking.
                         
           ELLIPSE: Cindy smokes one of Dean's cigarettes, calls her dad
                         A89 A89
           on a pay phone and tells him she won't be home for dinner
           because she is studying.
                         
           ELLIPSE. DEAN tells Cindy about his childhood, the
                         B89 B89
           sexualizing of his mother, and his fascination with women's
           purses. It makes Cindy a little uncomfortable.
                         
                          DEAN

           He digs through text books, pens, a wallet, asthma inhaler.
           Then he comes to a bottle of lotion. Opens the cap, sniffs.

           face. He enjoys the feeling of it, offers her some. She say's
           no. He digs through her purse and finds lip balm, smells it.
                         
                          DEAN

           steal Cindy's purse from her. It is a game. Innocent.
                         
           ELLIPSE. DEAN TRIES TO GIVE CINDY THE LOCKET. SHE REFUSES.

                          DEAN
           Probably. I think I... I think I already
           did. It's okay. There's an early one.
                         
                          CINDY
           You are just gonna stay up all night?

           Same streets. Same people. Everything
           here is the same. You walk down the

           Where do you want to go? I mean, if you
           could go anywhere..
                         
           They walk to an old playground. Cindy gets an idea.
                         
                          CINDY
           There!
                         
           Cindy runs to an old, creaky merry-go round, jumps on.
                         
                          CINDY (CONT'D)
           I used to love these things.
                         
                          DEAN
           Oh God... I hate these things.
                         
                          CINDY
           Push me.
                         
           Dean is tentative, but goes along with her. He starts slow,
           but she eggs him to go faster. He runs in circles picking up
           speed until he is in a breathless, circular sprint. He can't
           keep up with the centrifugal force.
                         
                          CINDY (CONT'D)
           Get on!
                         
           Dean does as he's told. They both hold on for dear life. The
           world spins in a frenzy. The dread on Dean's face builds to
           insane laughter. It is super fun. Cindy screams. Her hair
           snaps in her face. Then, a look of sickness steals her smile
           away. She wants it to stop, which, slowly, it does. She gets
           off first, tries to walk, but is too dizzy. She just keeps
           falling to the ground. Dean crawls off the merry-go round on
           all fours, laughing.

                          CINDY
           Make it stop.
                         
                          DEAN
           You gotta puke... it's the only way.
                         
           She refuses.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           It's the only way. It will make you feel
           better. Don't be embarrassed. I'll do it.
                         
           He sticks his finger down his throat and forces himself to
           vomit. The sound of it is too much for her. She gags. Side by
           side, they puke into the gravel. They finish their business
           and end up on their backs and out of breath, side by side,
           looking up at the stars. They are both covered in sweat. We
           see their breath.
                         
                          CINDY
           I'm still spinning.

           Me too.
                         
                          CINDY
           Maybe it's just the Earth that's
           spinning.
                         
                          DEAN
           Yeah. We're flying.
                         
           They laugh. Birds begin to awaken and fly.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           You should come visit me in the city
           sometime.
                         
           The morning air chills their bodies. Dean takes off his
           jacket and uses it as a blanket. They get close together to
           get warm and watch the stars spin above them.

           The dining room table is set for two. A single champagne 
           glass is raised.

                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           Hey! Wait up.
                         
                          CINDY
           We're toasting tonight?
                         
           Dean makes his toast. CLINK. Dean quaffs his glass.
                         
                          CINDY (CONT'D)
           Sometimes you don't make any sense. You
           might as well be speaking Chinese.
                         
           Dean imitates a Chinese man - it goes on too long.
                         
                          CINDY (CONT'D)
           Happy belated anniversary.
                         
           Cindy starts to eat a spread of Indian food and booze.
                         
                          DEAN

           Great. She's the best.
                         
                          CINDY
           She didn't sound sad?
                         
                          DEAN
           Naw. She's the champ. She's the best
           parts of you and the best parts of me put
           together. Everyday she gets more and more
           amazing.
                         
           Dean chews a bite of meat and washes it down with a shot of
           vodka. He refills both their glasses.

           I didn't say that. What I meant is that
           it's important for us to have our space.
           That's all. We're grown people.
                         
                          DEAN
           Well there's not much space here. So I

           You know, we rarely sit down and have a
           conversation. An adult conversation.
           Because every time we do, you turn
           something that I say around and make it
           mean something that I didn't mean to say.
           You just blab. Blab.

           this, us, all of it.
                         
           Cindy lifts up her empty wine glass to the light.
                         
                          CINDY
           I think my glass has a hole in it.
                         
           Cindy cuts around her food and pushes a piece aside.
                         
                          DEAN
           What's wrong with that?
                         
                          CINDY
           It's fat.
                         
                          DEAN
           That's the flavor. Eat it.
                         
                          CINDY
           I don't want to. You eat it. 
                         
           Dean stabs a piece of fat and pops it into his mouth.
                         
                          CINDY (CONT'D) 
           That's going straight to your tits.
                         
                          DEAN
           My tits? I got tits?
                         
           Dean opens his shirt and peers down at his chest. 
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D) 
           I could still kick yer ass.

           A dime and you're on.
                         
           Cindy gulps more champagne. They scoot dishes out of the way
           and clasp hands in the middle of the table.
                         
                          CINDY
           Ready?
                         
                          DEAN
           I'm always ready, baby.
                         
                          CINDY
           On the count of three... One... Two...
                         
           Cindy flexes and starts.
                         
                          CINDY (CONT'D)
           THREE!
                         
           Dean, acting as if he isn't trying at all, holds Cindy's hand
           at a stand still.
                         
                          DEAN
           Come on. Go! Start.
                         
           Cindy ignores his taunts and pushes as hard as she can.
           Slowly, she begins to push Dean's hand down. Dean groans, 
           letting her win a little. Cindy presses down with all her
           weight. His hand is centimeters from hitting the table. Then,
           he turns the tide. Cindy battles back with all the strength 
           she can muster. Dean laughs, realizing her passion for
           victory. Dean pounds her hand into the table. He stands
           kisses his flexed bicep. Cindy lifts her hand. A fork is 
           stuck in the back of it. She looks at it with curiosity.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D) 
           Oh fuck.
                         
                          CINDY 
           I'm alright.

           He plucks the fork from her hand, leaving four vampire bites.
                         
                          CINDY
           Ow ow ow.
                         
           Dean leads her to the kitchen, holds her hand under the
           faucet. 
                         
                          DEAN
           You think we should rush you to the
           hospital before you bleed to death?
                         
           Cindy shoots him a look. Dean wraps her hand with a dishrag. 
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           Does it hurt?
                         
                          CINDY
           It stings a little.
                         
           Dean tries to pick up Cindy. She struggles against it.
           Finally he cradles her like a squirming baby.
                         
                          CINDY (CONT'D)
           No, no... Put me down. It's okay...
                         
           Dean huffs a little. Cindy adjusts her weight, self-
           conscious. He hefts her down the hallway to the bedroom.
                         
           INT. ROMANTASUITES - MOON ROOM - NIGHT - PRESENT DAY

           Dean awkwardly sets Cindy down on the circular spaceship bed.
                         
                          DEAN
           Wait wait wait.
                         
           He flicks the switch and the bed starts spinning. He runs out
           of the room. Cindy watches the room around her spin. Dean
           returns with the vodka bottle and two shot glasses. He kneels
           above her and pours them two shots.

           To numb the pain. Doctors orders. I'm an

           I'm spinning.
                         
           She sits up. They toast. Dean gulps his. Cindy takes a sip.
                         
                          DEAN
           Drink up. We haven't gotten loaded
           together in years.
                         
           He tops off her glass, refills his own, and quaffs it. 
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           I gotta take a piss. Don't fall asleep.
                         
           He kisses her on the forehead, stumbles. Cindy hears Dean 
           urinating. She is sickened by it. She tries to set her full 
           glass on the floor that spins beneath her. The toilet
           flushes. The drink tips over. A loud crash comes from the
           BATHROOM. Cindy sits up.
                         
                          CINDY
           What are you doing in there? ...Dean?!
                         
           An agonizing moan comes from down the hall. Cindy staggers 
           off the spinning bed and stumbles to the bathroom door.
                         
                          CINDY (CONT'D)
           Are you all right? Dean...
                         
           She pushes the door but it is blocked. Dean moans louder. 
           Cindy pushes again and inches it open. She sticks her head 
           in, sees him laying on his back looking up at the ceiling. 
                         
                          DEAN (SLURS)

           want you to laugh.
                         
           Cindy opens the door and Dean scoots, making room for her. He
           lets out an "ow" before extending his hand.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)

           Cindy reluctantly joins him on the bathroom floor. Their
           faces are close, eyes locked.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)

           Cindy looks down.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           Hey...that's not funny? How come you
           don't think I'm funny any more? I tell
           you something funny. You laugh. I see you
           laugh. But you don't really laugh so
           much. You don't laugh anymore Cindy.
                         
                          CINDY

                          DEAN
           No I want to make you laugh.
                         
           Tears well up in her eyes. Dean rolls on top of her. He cups
           her face in his hands and stares long into her watery eyes.

           After a moment, their lips meet in an awkward rejuvenation.
           She moves her head away and pats Dean on the shoulder in a
           gesture of friendship. Dean kisses her neck.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)

           ... I want another child.
                         
           Cindy bites her lip. He slides his hand between her legs.
                         
                          CINDY
           No... Dean... Wait a second.
                         
           She removes his hand and places it on her hip. Dean continues
           to kiss her neck. He slides his hand up to her breasts. Cindy
           turns her head in the other direction. She pushes his hand
           away. He brings it back aggressive. Again. Cindy squirms 
           underneath him. He grabs her wrists and holds her arms over
           her head. His tongue licks Cindy from her breasts to her
           face. She worms her arms away and grabs onto his hair. She
           arches her back, looks at him through slit eyes. His pelvis
           pulses and he moans. He looks up at her over his brow into
           her desperate eyes. He springs up. Sweat beads on his
           forehead.
                         
                          DEAN
           What!? I can't have sex with my wife!?
                         
           Cindy covers her face with her hand.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           Do I repulse you that much? I'm good to
           you. I'm good to Frankie. I deserve a
           little affection. Do you want me to stop
           loving you? Do you want me to fuck other
           women? Do you want me to beat you?

           Is that what you think you deserve? Would

           Cindy raises her hips and slips off her panties. She lifts
           the shirt up over her head, positions her feet on the door
           jam. Her arm falls over her eyes. Breathless, Dean awkwardly
           moves one hand up and down her bodice.

           He unbuckles his belt, pushes his pants and underwear down to
           his knees, holds himself in his hand. He lowers onto her.
           Cindy adjusts her legs higher. He rotates his hips, looks
           away in concentration. Cindy's arms move around him, grabbing
           the small of his arching back. His pelvis humps in a feeble
           performance. A small moan. Cindy's eyes press closed harder.
           The erratic motion slows... stops. Dean's raspy breathing.
           His weight covers Cindy. She opens her eyes to the ceiling. 
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
                         
           She looks at him. His head faces away. She rolls out from
           underneath and stands. She wraps her dress around her and
           slips into the bedroom.

           Back against the closed door, Cindy turns the lock. Her eyes
           shift from despair to relief. Her gaze grows more wild. The
           doorknob jiggles. A secret, crazy laugh builds in Cindy that
           she suppresses. Dean presses his face into the bedroom door. 
           He talks to her. 
                         
           On the other side of the door, Cindy listens. Dean's voice
           cracks. A wave of confusion backs Cindy away from the door.
           She searches the room for an escape. There are no windows,
           the only way out is through the locked door. Trembling, she
           wraps her arms around herself. She tries to make herself as
           small as possible. The spaceship bed is the only place where
           she can disappear. She crawls underneath the covers, curls
           into a tight ball. Sadness lets loose. Cindy's body pulses
           with faint, painful tears. The black walls of the room
           twinkle with stars suspended in space. The cries get lost.

           Drunk, Dean and Cindy make out on the street corner. It is
           cold enough to see their breath. Their hands caress each
           other, feel what is underneath the layers of clothes. Cindy
           makes a move. She unbuttons Dean's Pea-Coat, feels the shape
           of his chest, his abdomen, his back.
                         
                          CINDY

           Dean follows suit, reaching up under her jacket to touch the
           skin on her lower back. She recoils from the icy touch.
                         
                          CINDY

           They make out in the back of a cab. But the cab driver won't
           allow it. But they can't keep their hands off each other.
           They try not to get caught.

           The door to Jake's room is cracked open and the TV is on.
           Dean and Cindy tiptoe in the apartment as quietly as they
           can. They can't keep their hands off each other. Dean makes a
           bed for them on the couch where he sleeps - straightening out
           a couple white sheets. They crawl under with clothes on.
                         
                          CINDY (WHISPERS)

           I don't know. Let me go check.
                         
           Dean tiptoes over to Jake's room. Peeks in his door. Returns
           to the couch where Cindy is taking off her jacket. He crawls
           back under the sheet.
                         
           DEAN (WHISPERS) (cont'd)
           He's just watching TV.
                         
           They start to make out while listening for Jake.
                         
                          CINDY (WHISPERS)
           Do you think he's gonna come out?

           brushed his teeth?
                         
           She nods. He throws off the sheet and goes into the bathroom,
           touches the bristles of Jake's tooth brush. Cindy takes off
           her socks and waits for Dean to return.

           It's still dry.
                         
           He gets back on the couch. They kiss. Slowly. Silently. Their
           hands search each other under the blanket. Clothing is
           removed and there is alot of movement, but the details of
           what occurs under that single sheet remain largely a mystery.
                         
           Jake's bedroom door opens and Jake walks out into the living
           room and into the kitchen. Dean and Cindy pantomime sleeping.
           They listen and hear Jake opening the refrigerator, pouring
           himself a bowl of cereal, crunching. They feel like he's
           watching them. Cindy tries her hardest not to laugh. Jake
           stares at the trembling sheet with contempt before returning
           to his room. Cindy releases her laugh. Dean tries to shush
           her, but he can't help laughing himself.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           Be quiet! Seriously. He's gonna kill me.
           He already hates me.
                         
                          CINDY
           You think he's gonna go to sleep now?
                         
           They hear Jake changing channels in the other room. As
           quietly as possible, they have sex under the sheet.

           A red plus sign bleeds onto the result area of a home
           pregnancy test. Cindy sits on a toilet in a stall holding the
           positive test stick. A knock on the BATHROOM door.

           She wraps the test in toilet paper and buries it in the trash

           Cindy opens the stall and confronts herself in the mirror.

           The note reads: I don't know if I can trust you. Can I trust

           The DOCTOR wheels over to the table in the center of the

           I'm going to have you lie up here, and

           Cindy gets on the table, looks over at a tray of instruments.
           The Doctor pulls a mask up over her face - the vacuum
           aspirator on a wheeled base. Cindy focuses her gaze at the
           corrugated ceiling, dim light.

           The Doctor touches Cindy's knee to spread her legs, picks up
           an instrument off the table.
                         
                          DOCTOR
           I want you to try and relax. This is
           going to be a little cold.
                         
           The Doctor inserts a speculum into Cindy's vagina.

           Doctor picks up a syringe.

           What's that?
                         
                          DOCTOR
           This is a mild anesthetic for your
           cervix. You're going to feel a pinch and
           then it's going to feel like electricity.
                         
           Cindy looks back up at the ceiling. She steady's her breath.
                         
                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)
           Can you cough for me.
                         
           Cindy coughs.

           Wheels move across the linoleum floor. The Doctor positions
           the vacuum aspirator.
                         
                          CINDY

           Cindy cuts herself off. The Doctor holds a hose.

           It won't take long. You may feel a little
           cramping.
                         
           The Doctor turns on the vacuum. Panic flushes Cindy's face.
           Her eyes widen.

           uterus. TROY, Bobby's wrestler friend, sits nearby.
                         
           The waiting room door opens, Cindy comes out. Dean puts the
           model back and stands up. They stare at each other. Dean nods
           slightly. Cindy shakes her head "no." A flush of realization
           across Dean's face, then a smile. He goes to her and wraps
           his arms around her.

           bright bus. Her head rests on his chest, arms holding his
           encircling arms. She is wearing the locket around her neck.
           Dean caresses Cindy's earlobe. Her eyes are closed.

           from the night before. She lifts her cell phone off the

           A SOUND - Cindy turns around sees her mom in the doorway.

           The car drives down a highway toward the city. TONY powers
           down beers in the back. Underwear hangs from the rearview.
                         
           BOBBY (V.O.)
           ...And I got nothing better to do than
           destroy you both. BEEP If you think I'm
           being evil, you have no idea, no idea at

           really don't give a fuck anymore...
                         
           Bobby shotguns a beer in the passenger's seat. Speed metal
           music and adrenaline. The car blasts down the street to the
           storage facility. The three bound out of the car, fists
           clenched, geared up for ultraviolence.

           They storm the reception. The office is empty - Jo is on her
           lunch break. Troy tries the door leading to the garage, it is
           locked. So he squeezes through the receptionist window, feels
           underneath the desk for the door release button. Tony yanks
           on the door. The door buzzes open and the gang, Bobby in the
           lead, rush into the cacophonous garage.

           Dean is all alone in the garage, loading up a truck with
           reams of cardboard boxes for a big job tomorrow. Bobby and
           gang search through a maze of yellow trucks.
                         
                          BOBBY

                          BOBBY (CONT'D)

           Who's askin'?
                         
           Bobby rushes him, throws a shoulder into his stomach. They
           both flail to the floor. The two lock. Everything is quick.
           Bobby sends a flurry of punches to Dean's ribs and guts. Dean
           pummels the back of Bobby's head with blind overhead rights.
           It becomes clear that Bobby has the upper hand. He holds
           Dean's bloodied head in some kind of jiujitsu headlock.
                         
                          BOBBY

           Dean struggles to breathe but manages to say...
                         
                          DEAN
           I think you're a fucking idiot.
                         
           Bobby hits him again, harder. Harder.
                         
                          BOBBY

           herself that everything is all right. Paces her room... Picks

           Troy whistles sharp, warning Bobby that Jo has just arrived.
           Bobby kicks Dean while he's down. Dean is beat and Bobby is
           running out of breath and strength.

           Bobby looks at his bloodied hands. He lacks the strength to
           lift he arms. Gives one last weak kick into Dean's bloodied
           face. Troy and Tony pull Bobby out. The gang leaves,
           victorious yet somehow defeated. The office phone, which has
           been ringing incessantly, stops.
                         
           Dean is on the floor in the fetal position. It takes him a
           while, but he manages to sit up. He feels the inside of his
           split lip with his tongue. He doesn't feel pain as much as he
           feels tingling and ringing - all over. Jo comes in. She
           freezes when she sees him.

           It takes Dean a while to get up, but he does. And it takes
           him a while to get to the office where his phone call awaits.
           Once there, he holds the receiver in his hand for a beat...

           Cindy. What's going on here?
                         
           Cindy points to Maria.

           Hello Mrs. Guevara. I'm Dr. Feinberg. I'm

           He reaches for the trembling Maria's blouse. Maria flinches.

           You need to fill that out, sir. You can

           There's nothing wrong with me.
                         
           Dean hands her back the clipboard.

           I got a ride.
                         
           Mimi appears behind Cindy.

           - I was going out of my mind. I didn't
           know if there's an emergency. I didn't
           know if Francis was hurt. Did you think
           about that?

           You're done. Leave.
                         
           Dean jerks Cindy up off the floor.
                         
                          DEAN
           Get up.
                         
           She hits Dean with a flurry of flailing fists.
                         
                          CINDY
           You son of a bitch!
                         
           Punches catch him in the nose. Cindy bullies Dean backwards
           with repeated shoves to the chest. He backs up down the
           hallway. Mimi stands in the hallway.
                         
                          MIMI
           Oh my god. Call 911. I'm going to call
           911.
                         
           The doors slide open and Dean backs outside.

           She digs into his pocket and fishes them out. She marches to
           the car, gets in the driver's seat, starts the car - the
           radio blasts at high decibels. Dean bangs on the passenger
           side window. Cindy flips the lock. Dean gets in the car.
                         
                          CINDY (CONT'D)
           I want a divorce!
                         
           She has emptied herself. Her whole body is numb and it feels
           as if she is floating in space. Anger overcomes Dean. He hits
           the dashboard with concrete fists.
                         
                          DEAN
           I know!
                         
           He grabs the suitcase next to him and opens the door. He
           throws it through the air into a FIELD - trying rid himself
           of pain, longing, and desperation. He clutches his wedding
           ring, but can't yank it off of his fat finger. Finally, he
           gets it off and tosses it into the field. The moment he
           releases it, he wishes he hadn't.
                         
           MOMENTS LATER - Dean and Cindy search for the ring. It is
           lost. Music begins to play in reverse.

           We follow Dean from behind - walking down the middle of the
           street. He holds the flowers. Meanwhile, we hear Cindy asking
           her gramma questions about love and life. "What's it like to
           be old?" - "when did men stop looking at you?" She confides
           her feelings for Dean. (The responses will be real responses -
           a real conversation).

           Dean finds the house. He straightens himself, walks to the
           front door, rings the BELL, checks the smell of his hands.
                         
           Jerry, bourbon in hand, opens the door. Dean's face is purple
           and swollen from the fight.
                         
                          DEAN
           I didn't know if it was pot luck so I
           brought an eggplant.
                         
           He points at his face. Behind Jerry, Cindy peeks out from the
           kitchen at the end of the hallway. It is the first time she
           has seen Dean since the fight. She is shocked.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           Face looks like an eggplant, don't it?
           How you doing sir, I'm Dean.
                         
           Dean holds out his hand. Jerry looks Dean up and down.
                         
                          CINDY
           Oh God.
                         
           Cindy squeezes by her father to Dean. The expression on her
           face says it all. Dean hands her the flowers, leans in and
           kisses her. While he's there he whispers.
                         
                          DEAN
           I stole these for you.
                         
                          CINDY
           Are you okay?
                         
           Dean nods. She leads him down the hall. Jerry stops, turns.
                         
           JERRY (to Cindy)
           Tell him to take off his shoes.
                         
           Dean removes his boots. A toe wiggles out of a holey sock. He
           gathers the hole and tucks it between his big toe and his
           second toe. Cindy leads him by the hand to the kitchen.

           - They eat. Dean compliments the meal. Glenda is self
           depreciating. Jerry is judgemental. Gramma wants to go home.
           Cindy can't take her eyes off of Dean - she has fallen.

           She begins gently kissing Dean's wounds. Whispers.

           No. It feels good. Keep doing it.
                         
           She does and is interrupted by... The FAINT SOUND of her
           parents fighting downstairs.
                         
           JERRY (O.S.)
           ...She's going to struggle the rest of

           And that's okay with you. Sit there...sit

           Maybe I should go.

           Cindy goes over to her stereo and turns on some music, low -
           it is the same song that Dean and Cindy listened to in the
           moon room. It drowns out some of the fighting. She approaches
           him, starts unbuttoning his shirt.

           She kisses him. Opens up his shirt. Reveals a severely
           bruised torso. He winces a bit from the movement. She
           redresses his wounds, nursing him back to health.

           She kisses his chest. Dean starts getting underneath Cindy's
           clothes. He places his palm on her belly.

           From here on out, their actions increase with urgency. Each

           they hear a door slam downstairs.

           Cindy puts on a simple yellow dress. She checks herself in
           the mirror. Her hand traces the bump on her belly.

           Cindy pours a glass of water. She gulps down aspirin. Dean
           keeps his distance at the edge of the room.
                         
           In the backyard, Frankie makes herself dizzy by twirling.
           Jerry cranes his neck to look into the window of his house.
                         
                          CINDY
           I'm not coming home.
                         
           Fear strikes Dean. He presses the base of his palms into his
           eyes, rubbing until he sees stars.
                         
                          DEAN
           We're not alone here Cynthia. We have a
           little girl. We need to think about her.
                         
                          CINDY
           I am thinking about her.
                         
                          DEAN
           All you're thinking about is yourself.
           You. Francis is gonna grow up in a broken
           home and that's OK with you.
                         
                          CINDY
           I can't let her grow up in a home where
           her parents don't love each other.
                         
                          DEAN
           Don't love each other? I've only ever
           loved you.
                         
           Dean approaches her from behind. Reaches out...

           Dean wears his baby blue tux. He looks himself up and down in
           the mirror. Takes a deep breath.

           Cindy flinches from Dean's touch. A look of terror in her
           eyes. Dean hushes her. He leads her to a chair and sits her
           down. He kneels by her side and repeats her name.

           He holds her hands and gropes her arms, legs, shoulders
           whatever she will let him touch. Cindy has tears in her eyes
           but she is focused. There is nothing to say.

           Dean takes a quarter, places it in a gumball machine, turns
           the crank. A plastic box rolls out. He takes it, shakes it -
           inside is a plastic ring. She takes a quarter and follows
           suit, buying another plastic ring.

           In THE KITCHEN, Frankie climbs in through the old dog door.
           She sees her father kneeling on the floor at her mother's
           feet. Perplexed, she pulls at her bottom lip with her finger.
           Cindy releases herself from Dean's grip and goes to her
           suitcase. She carries it up the stairs.

           Dean and Cindy wait together in a room filled with other
           people about to get married. They observe these other people
           and create fictional narratives about them and their lives
           for each other.

           Cindy opens the door and sets her suitcase on the dusty bed.
           The room is just like it used to be.

           Dean is defeated. He sits back against the cupboards and
           hangs his head down low between his knees. Frankie touches
           his shoulders. She gives him a massage.
                         
                          FRANKIE
           I want to stay at Grampa's house next
           time for fifty nights.
                         
           Dean looks up. He has tears in his eyes. Frankie touches one
           as it streams down his face.
                         
                          FRANKIE (CONT'D)

           Dean can't answer. Frankie slides a chair over to the sink.
           She steps up and fills the glass with water. Balancing it
           still, she brings it to Dean. She takes a sip and hands the
           glass to him. He drinks.
                         
                          DEAN

                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           Daddy's gonna go now, OK.
                         
           Dean stands and picks up Frankie. He walks to Cindy and hands
           her over.

           Frankie tries to squirm out of her mother's arms.
                         
                          FRANKIE
           Daddy!
                         
           Dean walks out the front door where he passes Jerry who
           stands on the porch. He moves across the lawn to the
           sidewalk. Vermillion light falls in the sky.
                         
           Cindy sets Frankie down and she runs out the door. Jerry
           catches the little girl by the arm and holds her tight.
                         
           Dean walks toward the horizon.

           Daddy!
                         
           Dean stops and turns. Cindy walks to the porch.
                         
                          CINDY
           Let her go, Dad.
                         
           Jerry releases her and Frankie runs fast to Dean. She jumps
           at him to go into his arms. He doesn't pick her up. From the
           porch Cindy and Jerry watch Dean as he points to them.
           Frankie doesn't move. Dean yells for her to go back. Frankie
           heads back to her mother, confused. Cindy kneels down and
           takes her in her arms.
                         
           Families light fireworks off in the middle of the streets.

           The houses form neighborhoods that join with other
           neighborhoods forming towns. Beyond the towns, hills stretch
           far into to the horizon. Fireworks explode against dark blue
