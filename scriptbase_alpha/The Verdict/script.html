<b>               INT. FIRST FUNERAL PARLOR - DAY
</b>
               A working-class funeral in progress. THIRTY PEOPLE and an 
               inexpensive bier SEEN from the back of the hall.

<b>               ANGLE
</b>
               A MAN's back FILLS the SCREEN. He is dressed in a black suit; 
               his hands are clasped behind him. ANOTHER MAN stands next to 
               him. The Second Man reaches behind the First Man's back and 
               puts a discreetly folded ten-dollar bill into his hands.

<b>               ANGLE
</b>
               These Two Men from the front. Both somber, in their early 
               fifties. They begin to walk down the aisle of the funeral 
               parlor.

<b>               ANGLE
</b>
               The WIDOW. A woman in her late fifties sitting by the bier 
               receiving condolences. The Two Men approach her. The First 
               Man (the recipient of the money) speaks:

<b>                                     FUNERAL DIRECTOR
</b>                         Mrs. Dee, this is Frank Galvin -- a 
                         very good friend of ours, and a very 
                         fine attorney.

<b>                                     GALVIN
</b>                         It's a shame about your husband, 
                         Mrs. Dee.

               The Widow nods.

<b>                                     GALVIN
</b>                         I knew him vaguely through the Lodge. 
                         He was a wonderful man.
                              (shakes head in 
                              sympathy)
                         It was a crime what happened to him. 
                         A crime. If there's anything that I 
                         could do to help...

               GALVIN removes a business card from his jacket pocket and 
               hands it to her as if he were giving her money. (i.e., "Take 
               it. Really. I want you to have it..." She takes the card.

               Beat.

<b>                                     GALVIN
</b>                              (thoughtfully realizes 
                              he is usurping her 
                              time)
                         Well... 

               He shakes her hand and moves on.

<b>               INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
</b>
               Galvin sitting in the deserted coffee shop in his raincoat.

               Reading a section of the paper. He picks up his teacup, 
               drinks. Lowers it to the table.

<b>               ANGLE - INSERT
</b>
               Galvin twists tea bag around a spoon to extract last drops 
               of tea. His hand moves to his felt pen lying on the table.

               He moves his hand to the paper, open at the obituary section.

               We SEE several names crossed out. He circles one funeral 
               listing.

<b>               ANGLE
</b>
               Galvin sitting, raises cup of tea to his lips. Looks around 
               deserted coffee shop. Sighs.

<b>               INT. SECOND FUNERAL HOME AND STREET - AFTERNOON
</b>
               Galvin outside a second funeral home. WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE 
               entering, Galvin enters the home.

<b>               ANGLE
</b>
               Galvin, coming down the aisle toward the front, shrugging 
               himself out of his overcoat, he approaches the BEREAVED WIDOW 
               sitting by the front of the home, he extracts his card from 
               his pocket, starts to speak. He is stopped by the WIDOW'S 
               SON, a hefty man in his mid-forties, who interjects himself 
               between Galvin and the widow.

<b>                                     SON
</b>                              (of the card)
                         What is that...?

<b>                                     GALVIN
</b><b>                         I...
</b>
<b>                                     SON
</b>                         What the hell is that...

<b>                                     GALVIN
</b>                         ...I was a friend of your fa...

<b>                                     SON
</b>                         You never knew my father.
                              (hits card out of 
                              Galvin's hand)
                         You get out of here, who the hell do 
                         you think you are...

               The FUNERAL MANAGER hurries down the aisle, and starts 
               extricating Galvin from the commotion.

<b>                                     GALVIN
</b>                              (to Funeral Manager)
                         I'm talking to this man...

<b>                                     FUNERAL MANAGER
</b>                         Excuse me, Mrs. Cleary...

               He is manhandling Galvin toward the back of the funeral 
               parlor. The Son calls after him:

<b>                                     SON
</b>                         Who the hell do you think you are?

<b>               EXT. SECOND FUNERAL PARLOR - AFTERNOON
</b>
               The Funeral Manager and Galvin standing in the cold.

<b>                                     FUNERAL MANAGER
</b>                         I don't want you coming back here. 
                         Ever. Do you understand?

<b>                                     GALVIN
</b>                         I was just talking to...

<b>                                     FUNERAL MANAGER
</b>                         Those are bereaved people in there.

               The Funeral Manager gives Galvin a small shove, and goes 
               back to his post at the door, greeting the entering mourners.

               "Good evening..."

<b>               ANGLE
</b>
               Galvin, the ground cut out from under him. Standing watching 
               the mourners enter.

<b>               EXT. SECOND FUNERAL STREET - DUSK
</b>
               Galvin walking down a residential street. He has been walking 
               a while in the cold, snowy night. He stops for a stoplight 
               at a corner, waits for the light although there is no traffic.

               Lights a cigarette. The light changes. He looks both ways 
               and irresolutely starts across the street. He stops. He checks 
               his watch. He sighs, and starts back in the opposite 
               direction.

<b>               INT. O'ROURKE'S BAR - NIGHT
</b>
               Galvin holding forth at the bar of a seedy drinking-man's 
               establishment, THREE DRINKERS, acquaintances, standing around 
               him, appreciative.

<b>                                     GALVIN
</b>                         Pat says, 'Mike... there's a new 
                         bar, you go in, for a half a buck 
                         you get a beer, a free lunch, and 
                         then take you in the back room and 
                         they get you laid.'

               The bartender, JIMMY, comes up to Galvin.

<b>                                     JIMMY
</b>                         Another, Frank...?

<b>                                     GALVIN
</b>                              (gestures to include 
                              group)
                         ...everybody. Mike says, 'Pat, you 
                         mean to tell me for a buck you get a 
                         free lunch and a beer, and then you 
                         go in the back and get laid?' 'That's 
                         correct.' Mike says, 'Pat. Have you

<b>               INT. GALVIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>
               The seedy, disorganized small office, Galvin in shirt-sleeves 
               opening a file cabinet. He takes out an armload of files, 
               carries them to a wastebasket and throws them in. He sits on 
               his desk, as if exhausted by his effort, pours from a whiskey 
               bottle into a large water glass, downs the glass.

               He has been drinking for some time. He starts stumbling back 
               to the file cabinet. On the way his eye is caught by his 
               degrees hanging on the wall. He stumbles to them, picks them 
               up and walks over to the wastebasket and throws them in. He 
               goes back to the file cabinet, the phone starts ringing. 
               Galvin lets it ring, continues emptying the files into the 
               wastebasket, tearing some of them up as he does so.

               He repeats softly to himself, as a litany, "It doesn't make 
               a bit of difference, it doesn't make a bit of difference..." 
               He starts back to the desk for the bottle, knocks the still-
               ringing phone off the desk. He pours himself a drink.

               As he downs it we hear -- softly -- from the phone on the 
               floor: a MAN'S VOICE. "Frank. Frank. Frank. Goddamnit. Are 
               you there...? Frank..." Galvin pays no attention.

               Drinks his drink and gazes at the wall -- now empty of 
               degrees.

               downing a shot, the file open before him. He is reading.

               He checks his watch, scoops the file together under his arm,

               from his drinking. He puts his back against the door, puts 
               down file and briefcase, extracts a small cheap Polaroid 
               camera from the briefcase, readies it to shoot, picks up his 
               paraphernalia, and starts off down the ward. As he walks 
               down the ward he checks the file hung at the foot of each

               it a shriveled, tiny form stuck with needles and tubes.

               the foot of the bed, takes a flash photo of the figure in 
               the bed. Takes another one. Puts down camera, sits on the 
               end of the bed gazing at the unseen form. He lights a

               ...a conference room. Mahogany, tinted glass, a panoramic 
               view of Boston. Twenty-five attorneys, male and female, mostly 
               young, gaze at the young Attorney as he enters the room. He 
               stops running. He approaches the front of the room 
               tentatively. Standing at the blackboard in front of the 
               conference room is EDWARD CONCANNON. Senior partner of the 
               firm, late fifties, imposing, he radiates success. As the 
               young Attorney approaches Concannon he is stopped with a

                         You're all acquainted with this case. 
                         It's been scheduled for eighteen 
                         months. We have the attorney for the

                         trust you are all familiar with his

                         him to call us to negotiate. As he 
                         did not, and five days before we're 
                         supposed to go to court we made him 
                         a rather generous offer, which he 
                         refused. Five days before the trial. 
                         What does this mean? I want to find

                         that we did it last year. Do it again.

               down the bed, sees the silver-framed picture of his wife, he 
               looks back at Laura, starts to take the picture to turn it

</b>                         Dr. Thompson. From your review of 
                         the hospital records of May twelfth 
                         nineteen seventy-six.

</b>                         In your opinion, what happened to 
                         Deborah Ann Kaye?

<b>                                     DR. THOMPSON
</b>                         Cardiac arrest. During delivery her 
                         heart stopped. When the heart stops 
                         the brain's deprived of oxygen. You 
                         get brain damage. That is why she's 
                         in the state she's in today.

<b>                                     GALVIN
</b>                         Now, Dr. Towler's testified that 
                         they restored the heartbeat within 
                         three or four minutes. In your opinion 
                         is his estimate correct?

<b>                                     DR. THOMPSON
</b>                         It's my opinion it took him much 
                         longer. Nine... ten minutes. There's 
                         too much brain damage.

                         restore the heartbeat within nine 
                         minutes in itself constitutes bad

               He stands by Laura and looks down at her, he looks at Mickey.

               He has let them down. He goes to a cabinet under the lawbooks 
               and takes out a bottle of whiskey and a water glass. He walks

               Glances at the several letters that have just fallen through 
               the slot. He pours a half-tumbler full of whiskey, and drains 
               it. He refills the tumbler. He absently picks up the mail 
               and starts mechanically sorting through it. He stops at an

                         All right.

               Sound of him hanging up a telephone. He enters the frame 
               carrying a bottle of booze, goes through door into study.

               He sits on a sofa opposite the television. Watches the game 
               a beat. Opens the fresh bottle of whiskey and pours a large 
               shot into the almost-empty glass in front of him. Looks to 
               his left. Reaches behind him to some glasses on a shelf, 
               takes one down, pours drink into the new glass, leans to his 
               left, CAMERA MOVES WITH him, and we SEE Galvin sitting in a 
               deep leather armchair, staring. Mickey offers him the drink.

               Galvin becomes aware of him, shakes his head "no." Beat.

               Mickey moves back into his seat, they both stare at the

               Galvin gets up from Plaintiff's table, takes up a large book 
               as Dr. Towler takes the stands. He reads:

                         to nine hours prior to induction of

</b>                         In my religion we say, 'Act as if 
                         you had faith, and faith will be 
                         given to you.'
                              (beat)
                         If... If we would have faith in 
                         justice, we must only believe in 
                         ourselves.
                              (beat)
                         And act with justice.
                              (beat)
                         And I believe that there is justice 
                         in our hearts.
                              (beat)

               Young Lawyer scribbles a note, passes it to Concannon, who 
               ignores it.

               The Jury Box. The Jurors seated, the FOREMAN standing.

<b>               ANGLE
</b>
               Galvin, totally defeated. Nods his head sadly, as if 
               commiserating philosophically, with himself. Mickey looks at 
               him in grief, with sympathy.

<b>                                     FOREMAN (V.O.)

                         greater than the amount the Plaintiff 
                         asked for?

               Galvin slowly raises his head, turns and looks at the Jury, 
               Mickey begins to smile.

<b>                                     JUDGE

</b>
               Galvin and Mickey standing near a back staircase, cleaning 
               equipment is lying all around. A large, battered garbage 
               can. Mickey is lighting Galvin's cigarette. Galvin's hand 
               shakes badly. Something draws his attention at the end of 
               the corridor. He turns his head.

<b>               ANGLE - P.O.V.
</b>
               Laura, standing at the end of the corridor. Tentative, lost, 
               pleading silently, she holds a sheet of yellow legal paper 
               in her hand.

<b>               ANGLE - INSERT - LAURA'S P.O.V.

<b>               THE PAPER READS:

               Laura holding the paper.

</b>
               Galvin and Mickey looking at her. Galvin's face impassive.

               Beat. He turns his back on her. Mickey does likewise.

               Beat.

                              (beat; tentatively)
                         You want to run across the street 
                         and get a drink?

               Beat. Galvin puts his arm around Mickey's shoulder. They 
               push through the Exit Door, turning up their collars to the 
               cold. Galvin hesitates a moment as Mickey goes through the 
               door. Beat. He looks back longingly.

               The deserted corridor.

</b>
               Galvin standing framed in the doorway. He turns toward the 
               door, his back to the CAMERA, his shoulders slumped. He stands 
               for a moment, sighs, straightens up, and walks through the 
               door.
