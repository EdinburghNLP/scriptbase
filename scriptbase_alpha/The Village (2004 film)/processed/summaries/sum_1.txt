'The Village' depicts the tale of an isolated town confronting the astonishing truth that lies just outside its borders.
At first glance, this village seems picture perfect, but this close-knit community lives with the frightening knowledge that creatures reside in the surrounding woods.
The evil and foreboding force is so unnerving that none dare venture beyond the borders of the village and into the woods.
But when curious, headstrong Lucius Hunt plans to step beyond the boundaries of the town and into the unknown, his bold move threatens to forever change the future of the village.
