<b>				 DO THE RIGHT THING

"The greatest miracle Christianity has achieved in America
is that the black man in white Christian hands has not grown
violent.  It is a miracle that 22 million black people have
not risen up against their oppressors--in which they would
have been justified by all moral criteria, and even by the
democratic tradition!  It is a miracle that a nation of
black people has so fervently continued to believe in a
turn-the-other-cheek and heaven-for-you-after-you-die
philosophy!  It is a miracle that the American Black people
have remained a peaceful people, while catching all the
centuries of hell that they have caught, here in white man's
heaven!  The miracle is that the white man's puppet Negro
'leaders,' his preachers and the educated Negroes laden with
degrees, and others who have been allowed to wax fat off
their black poor brothers, have been able to hold the black
masses quiet until now."

<b>					  WEATHER

<b>								    CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT: WE LOVE RADIO STATION STOREFRONT--DAY
</b>
<b>EXTREME CLOSE UP
</b>
WE SEE only big white teeth and very Negroidal (big) lips.

<b>					MISTER SEÑOR LOVE DADDY
</b>		  Waaaake up!
		  Wake up!  Wake up!  Wake up!
		  Up ya wake!  Up ya wake!  Up ya wake!

<b>CAMERA MOVES BACK SLOWLY TO REVEAL MISTER SEÑOR LOVE DADDY,
</b>a DJ, a radio personality, behind a microphone.


<b>					MISTER SEÑOR LOVE DADDY
</b>		  This is Mister Señor Love Daddy.
		  Your voice of choice.  The world's
		  only twelve-hour strongman, here on
		  WE LOVE radio, 108 FM.  The last on
		  your dial, but the first in ya
		  hearts, and that's the truth, Ruth!

The CAMERA, which is STILL PULLING BACK, shows that Mister
Señor Love Daddy is actually sitting in a storefront window.
The control booth looks directly out onto the street.  This
is WE LOVE RADIO, a modest station with a loyal following,
right in the heart of the neighborhood.  The OPENING SHOT
will be a TRICK SHOT--the CAMERA PULLING BACK through the
storefront window.

<b>					MISTER SEÑOR LOVE DADDY
</b>		  Here I am.  Am I here?  Y'know it.
		  It ya know.  This is Mister Señor
		  Love Daddy, doing the nasty to ya
		  ears, ya ears to the nasty.  I'se
		  play only da platters dat matter,
		  da matters dat platter and that's
		  the truth, Ruth.

He hits the cart machine and we hear a station jingle.

<b>					VO
</b><b>		  L-O-V-E RADIO.
</b>
<b>					MISTER SEÑOR LOVE DADDY
</b>		  Doing da ying and yang da flip and
		  flop da hippy and hoppy
			    (he yodels)
		  Yo da lay he hoo.  I have today's
		  forecast.
			    (he screams)
<b>		  HOT!
</b>
He laughs like a madman.

<b>INT: DA MAYOR'S BEDROOM--DAY
</b>
An old, grizzled man stirs in the bed, his sheets are soaked
with sweat.  He flings them off his wet body.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  Damn, it's hot.

<b>INT: JADE'S APARTMENT--DAY
</b>
CAMERA MOVES IN ON a young man sitting at the edge of a sofa
bed.

<b>CLOSE UP--HIS SMALL HANDS
</b>
WE SEE him counting his money.  This isn't any ordinary
counting of money, he's straightening out all the corners of
the bills, arranging them so the bills--actually the "dead
presidents"--are facing the same way.  This is MOOKIE.  Once
he's finished with that task, counting his money, he sneaks
into his sister's bedroom.

<b>INT: JADE'S BEDROOM--DAY
</b>
<b>CLOSE UP--JADE
</b>
JADE, Mookie's sister, is fast asleep.  Mookie's fingers
ENTER THE FRAME and start to play with her lips.  Jade
pushes his hands away.  Mookie waits several beats and he
continues.  Jade wakes up--mad.

<b>					JADE
</b>		  Don't you have enough sense not to
		  bother people when they're sleeping?

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Wake up!

<b>					JADE
</b>		  Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day
		  I get to sleep late.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  It's gonna be hot today.

<b>					JADE
</b>		  Good!  Leave me alone when I'm
		  sleeping.  I'm gonna get a lock on
		  my door, to keep ya ass outta here.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Don't ya love ya brother Mookie
		  anymore?  I loves ya, Jade.

<b>					JADE
</b>		  Do me a favor.  Go to work.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Later.  Gotta get paid.

He plants a big fat juicy on his sister's forehead.

<b>EXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY
</b>
A 1975 El Dorado pulls up in front of the neighborhood
pizzeria--Sal's Famous Pizzeria.

From out of the car comes the owner, SAL, a slightly
overweight man in his early fifties, and his two sons, PINO,
22, and VITO, 20.  It's time for them to go to work at Sal's
Famous Pizzeria in the heart of Black Brooklyn.  Sal's sits
on the corner of The Block.  The Block being where this film
on the hottest day of the summer takes place.

Pino kicks a beer can in his path into the gutter.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Pino, get a broom and sweep out
		  front.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  Vito, get a broom and sweep out
		  front.

<b>					VITO
</b>		  See, Pop.  That's just what I was
		  talkin' about.  Every single time
		  you tell Pino to do something, he
		  gives it to me.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  He's nuts.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  The both of youse, shaddup.

<b>					VITO
</b>		  Tell Pino.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  Get the broom.

<b>					VITO
</b>		  I ain't getting shit.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Hey!  Watch it.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  I didn't want to come to work
		  anyway.  I hate this freakin' place.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Can you do better?  C'mere.

Pino is now silent.  Sal walks over to him.


<b>					SAL
</b>		  Can you do better?
			    (he pops Pino upside
			    the head)
		  I didn't think so.  This is a
		  respectable business.  Nuthin'
		  wrong with it.  Get dat broom.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  Tell Vito.

<b>					VITO
</b>		  Pop asked you.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  I'm gonna kill somebody today.

<b>EXT: MOOKIE'S BROWNSTONE--DAY
</b>
Mookie comes down his stoop and walks to work.

<b>EXT: STREET--DAY
</b>
The Block is beginning to come to life.  Those unlucky souls
who have to work this Saturday drag themselves to it, and
the kids are out on the street to play in the hot sun all
day long.

<b>EXT: MOTHER SISTER'S STOOP--DAY
</b>
Mookie stops to say hello to MOTHER SISTER.  She leans out
her window on the parlor floor.  In the summertime, the only
time when she's not perched in her window is when she's
asleep.

<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  Good morning, Mookie.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Good morning to you.

<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  Now, Mookie, don't work too hard
		  today.  The man said it's gonna be
		  HOT as the devil.  I don't want ya
		  falling out from the heat.  You
		  hear me, son?

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  I hear ya, Mother Sister.  I hear
		  you.


<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  Good.  I'll be watching ya, son.
		  Mother Sister always watches.

<b>INT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY
</b>
Mookie enters the pizzeria and Pino is on him before the
door closes.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  Mookie, late again.  How many times
		  I gotta tell you?

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Hello, Sal.  Hello, Vito.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  How ya doin', Mookie?

<b>					VITO
</b>		  Whaddup?

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Just coolin'.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  You're still late.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Pino, relax, will ya.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  Here, take the broom.  The front
		  needs sweeping.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I
		  just got here.  You sweep.  I
		  betcha Sal asked you first anyhow.

<b>					VITO
</b>		  That's right.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  Shaddup, Vito.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas.
		  That's what I get paid for.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  You get paid to do what we say.


<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  What we say.  I didn't hear Sal say
		  nuthin'.

Pino looks at his father.  He wants to be backed up on this;
all he gets is an amused look, and a smirk from Vito.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  Who's working for who?

There's a knock on the door and Da Mayor enters.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Come on in, Mayor.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  Good morning, gentlemens.  It's
		  gonna be a scorcher today, that's
		  for sure.  Need any work done
		  around here?

Sal looks at Pino, who reluctantly gives Da Mayor the broom.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  It will be the cleanest sidewalk in
		  Brooklyn.  Clean as the Board of
		  Health.

Da Mayor almost runs out of the pizzeria in his hurry; soon
as he finishes he'll be able to get a bottle.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  Pop, I don't believe this shit.  We
		  runnin' welfare or somethin'?
		  Every day you give dat bum--

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Da Mayor ain't no bum.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping
		  our sidewalk.  What do we pay
		  Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I
		  work harder than him and I'm your
		  own son.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Who don't work?  Let's see you
		  carry six large pies up six flights
		  of stairs.  No elevator either and
		  shit.


<b>					SAL
</b>		  Both of youse--shaddup.  This is a
		  place of business.

<b>					VITO
</b>		  Tell 'em, Pop.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  Me and you are gonna have a talk.

<b>					VITO
</b>		  Sez who?

<b>					PINO
</b>		  Sez me.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Hey!  What did I say?

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Who doesn't work?  Don't start no
		  shit, won't be no shit.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Mookie, no cursing in the store.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Talk to your son.

<b>EXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY
</b>
Da Mayor sweeps the sidewalk, happy as can be.  As soon as
he finishes he can get that money and get that bottle.

<b>EXT: STOOP--DAY
</b>
A group of youths sit on a stoop, waiting for someone.  They
are CEE, PUNCHY, and the lone female, ELLA.

<b>					ELLA
</b>		  What's keeping him?

<b>					PUNCHY
</b>		  You call him, then.

Ella stands up and yells.

<b>					ELLA
</b>		  Yo, Ahmad!

<b>					PUNCHY
</b>		  I coulda done dat.


<b>					ELLA
</b>		  Yo, Ahmad!

She looks up into his window, then sits down.

<b>					ELLA
</b>		  Punchy, if ya want to do some more
		  screaming, be my guest.  I'm too
		  through.

The door swings open at the top of the stoop and AHMAD
appears.

<b>					AHMAD
</b>		  Who's yelling my name?

<b>					ELLA
</b>		  Punchy told me to.

<b>					AHMAD
</b>		  Don't listen to him, it will get ya
		  in trouble.

<b>					ELLA
</b>		  Heard that, Punchy.

Ahmad sits down with them.

<b>					AHMAD
</b>		  Ella, you have a brain, use it.

In the BG, we hear the dum-dum-dum of a giant box.  The
sound gets louder as the box gets closer.  The youths look
down the block and see a tall young man coming towards them.
He has a very distinct walk, it's more like a bop.  This is
RADIO RAHEEM.  The size of his box is tremendous and one has
to think, how does he carry something that big around with
him?  It must weigh a ton, and it seems like the sidewalk
shakes as the rap music blares out.  The song we hear is the
only one Radio Raheem plays.

<b>MEDIUM SHOT--RADIO RAHEEM
</b>
Radio Raheem stops in front of the group, looks at them, and
turns down the volume.  It's quiet again.

<b>					RADIO RAHEEM
</b>		  Peace, y'all.

<b>					ELLA
</b>		  Peace, Radio Raheem.

<b>					CEE
</b>		  Peace.

<b>											    10.
</b>

<b>					PUNCHY
</b>		  You the man, Radio Raheem.

<b>					AHMAD
</b>		  It's your world.

<b>					CEE
</b>		  In a big way.

Radio Raheem nods and turns up the volume.  Way up.

<b>					AHMAD
</b>		  My people.  My people.

<b>EXT: WE LOVE STOREFRONT--DAY
</b>
Radio Raheem waves to Mister Señor Love Daddy as he walks by.

<b>INT: WE LOVE CONTROL BOOTH--DAY
</b>
Mister Señor Love Daddy gives Radio Raheem a clenched-fist
salute.

<b>EXT: FRUIT-N-VEG DELIGHT--DAY
</b>
Da Mayor walks into a newly opened fruit and vegetable deli
stand that is owned by Koreans.

<b>INT: FRUIT-N-VEG DELIGHT--DAY
</b>
Da Mayor is looking for his beer in the refrigerated cases,
his ice-cold beer.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  Where's the Bud?  Where's the Bud?

<b>					KOREAN CLERK
</b>		  No mo' Bud.  You look what we have
		  and buy.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  No more Bud.  What kind of joint is
		  this?  How come no mo' Bud?  Doctor,
		  this ain't Korea, China, or wherever
		  you come from.  Get some Budweiser
		  in this motherfucker.

<b>					KOREAN CLERK
</b>		  You buy 'nother beer.

<b>											    11.
</b>

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  Alright.  Alright.  Y'know you're
		  asking a lot to make a man change
		  his beer, that's asking a lot,
		  Doctor.

<b>EXT: MOTHER SISTER'S STOOP--DAY
</b>
Da Mayor has his can of beer (not Budweiser) and the brown
paper bag is twisted into a knot at the bottom.  He stops
and takes a long swig.

<b>					MOTHER SISTER

		  Move on, you're blocking my view.

Da Mayor lowers the can from his mouth and looks up at his
heckler.  It's obvious from the look on his face he's heard
this before.  Da Mayor contorts his face and stares at her.

<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  You ugly enough.  Don't stare at me.

Da Mayor changes his face into a more grotesque look.

<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  The evil eye doesn't work on me.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  Mother Sister, you've been talkin'
		  'bout me the last eighteen years.
		  What have I ever done to you?

<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  You're a drunk fool.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  Besides that.  Da Mayor don't
		  bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother
		  Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just
		  mind his business.  I love everybody.
		  I even love you.

<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  Hold your tongue.  You don't have

</b>		  One day you'll be nice to me.  We

Da Mayor tips his beat-up hat to Mother Sister and takes a
final swig of beer just for her.

<b>INT: TINA'S APARTMENT--DAY

An elderly Puerto Rican woman, CARMEN, is telling off her
daughter TINA in Spanish.  Tina, having heard enough, closes
the door on her mother's ranting and raving.

<b>ANGLE--TINA
</b>
Tina bends down and scoops her baby son HECTOR up from the
bed and holds him for dear life to her breasts.  She talks
to her son while walking around the room.

<b>					TINA
</b>		  Hector, I shouldn't be telling you
		  this but you would find out sooner
		  or later.  Ya father ain't no real
		  father.  He's a bum, a two-bit bum
		  in a hundred-dollar world.  Your
		  father is to the curb.  You're
		  smart.  I see that look on ya face.
		  You're saying if he's such a bum
		  why am I with him?  Good question.
		  Like I said before, you're no dummy.
		  He talked his way into my panties,
		  I thought being a mother would make
		  me happy, make me whole.  He's a
		  mistake, but you are not.

Tina kisses her son.  Tina is seventeen years old, another
teenage parent.

<b>EXT: STREET CORNER--DAY
</b>
Every day on this corner, summer or winter, spring or fall,
a small group of men meet.  They have no steady employment,
nothing they can speak of; they do, however, have the gift
of gab.  These man can talk, talk, and mo' talk, and when a
bottle is going round and they're feeling "nice," they get
philosophical.  These men become the great thinkers of the
world, with solutions to all its ills; like drugs, the
homeless, and AIDS.  They're called the Corner Men: SWEET
DICK WILLIE, COCONUT SID, and ML.  All three are sitting in
folding chairs up against a wall in the shade.

<b>					ML
</b>		  The way I see it, if this hot
		  weather continues, it will surely
		  melt the polar caps and the whole

</b>		  Fool, you're thirty cents away from

<b>					ML
</b>		  Don't worry about it.

Buggin' Out looks at the slice.

Buggin' Out slams his money down on the counter, takes his
slice and sits down.

All around Buggin' Out, peering down from the WALL OF FAME,

Sal comes from behind the counter with his Louisville

Nilda hands him a handful of singles.  Mookie looks at the
crumpled mess.  Nilda attempts to close the door, but
Mookie's foot says, "Hell no."

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Hold it.  Let me count this first.

First he straightens out the dollars, then counts the bills.

<b>					MOOKIE

Mother Sister hands her a bag that is at her side.

<b>											    19.
</b>

<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  Seen your brother, just walked by.

Jade unwraps a head scarf from around Mother Sister's head
and a full head of long black hair falls to her shoulders.

<b>					JADE
</b>		  This might take some time.

<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  I got nowhere to go.  We haven't
		  had a good sit-down for a long while.

Jade begins to part, grease, and comb out Mother Sister's
hair.

<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  Tender-headed runs in my family.
		  You tender-headed?

<b>					JADE
</b>		  Yeah, me too.

<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  That's why I don't fool with it.
		  Only let you touch it...Ouch!

They both laugh.

<b>HOT, HOTTER AND HOTTEST MONTAGE

Right now, folks, we're gonna suspend the narrative and show
how people are coping with the oppressive heat.

People are taking cold showers.

Sticking faces in ice-cold, water-filled sinks.

Heads stuck in refrigerators.

A wife tells her husband, "Hell no, I'm not cooking.  It's
too hot.  The kitchen is closed."

Men downing six-packs of ice-cold brew.

Faces stuck directly in front of fans.

A young kid cracks an egg on Sal's Cadillac.  The moment the
egg hits the car hood it starts to cook.  The kid looks
directly INTO THE CAMERA and smiles, then looks up to see
Sal, mad as a motherfucker, chasing after him.

And how can I forget the papers, the newspaper headlines.

Ahmad has just turned on the johnny pump and the white
stream of water flies across the street.

This attracts all the people of the block.  It's a chance to
cool off and momentarily beat the killer heat.

<b>ANGLE--CEE AND PUNCHY

</b>
They're still scraping away.

<b>ANGLE--STREET
</b>
Folks, young and old, begin to get in the water and play.

<b>ANGLE--CEE AND PUNCHY
</b>
Both now have cans with the ends scraped away, and go to the
johnny pump.  Punchy bends down behind the hydrant and
places the can over the water.  The can now directs the
water into giant streams.

<b>ANGLE--ELLA
</b>
Ahmad sneaks up behind Ella and picks her up.  She's kicking
and screaming furiously.

<b>					ELLA
</b>		  Ahmad!  Put me down!  Put me down!
		  I can't get wet!  I'm not playing!

Ahmad is not having it.  He carries a kicking Ella into the
middle of the street in direct line of fire.

<b>					AHMAD
</b>		  Yo!

<b>					ELLA
</b>		  No!

They both are hit with a blast of water and are soaked to
the bone.  Ella starts to punch Ahmad, and chases after him.

<b>ANGLE--STREET
</b>
We hear the familiar rap music of Radio Raheem's box.

<b>CLOSE--RADIO RAHEEM

Radio Raheem is too cool.  By the way he's dressed, it could
be fall, not the hottest day of the year.  But you could
never tell it from him.  He's too cool.

Raheem looks at Cee, he wants to get by and he doesn't want
to get wet either.  And if his box gets wet, somebody is
gonna die.  Cee knows this too.

<b>ANGLE--JOHNNY PUMP

Cee stands in front of the hydrant, blocking the water so
Radio Raheem can pass.

He slowly bops across the street as all eyes watch.  When
he's clear, Cee moves and the water gushes out again as
folks play.

We hear a car horn blowing.  People move out of the way as
the vehicle speeds through the spray.

Cee and Punchy leap off the hydrant, unleashing a jet blast
that flies directly into Charlie's car.  The whole block is
dying.

Charlie pulls his flooded car over to the curb, jumps out,
and runs to get hold of Cee and Punchy.  Of course, he's
slow, as the kids turn into track stars and make like Carl

The ranting continues, and people laugh at him.

A cop car screeches to a halt in front of the man.  Two

Officer Long sides up to Da Mayor who's been looking on.

Da Mayor is quiet.

Officer Ponte goes to Da Mayor's other side.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  Those who'll tell don't know.
		  Those who know won't tell.

Mookie emerges from the crowd and leads Da Mayor away from
the interrogation.

<b>					MOOKIE

<b>					OFFICER PONTE
</b>		  I suggest you get in your car

The man looks at the crowd of Blacks and Puerto Ricans
around him and he considers what he just heard.

On a stoop, a group of Puerto Ricans sits talking, drinking

parked near the stoop, and blasts salsa music.

As usual we hear the rap music of Radio Raheem, but
underneath the salsa music.  Radio Raheem does not like to
be bested; the salsa music from the parked car is giving him
competition, this is no good.  Radio Raheem stands in front
of the stoop and raises his decibel level.

<b>ANGLE--STOOP

The Puerto Rican men look at him, then begin to yell at him
in Spanish.  There is a standoff, the rap and salsa clashing
in a deafening roar.  One of the men, STEVIE, gets off the

<b>					CLIFTON
</b>		  Yes?

<b>					BUGGIN' OUT
</b>		  You almost knocked me down.  The

<b>					CLIFTON
</b>		  Excuse me.  I'm very sorry.

<b>					BUGGIN' OUT
</b>		  Not only did you knock me down, you
		  stepped on my new white Air Jordans
		  that I just bought and that's all
		  you can say, "Excuse me?"

This commotion has attracted a crowd, including Ahmad, Cee,
Punchy, and Ella.

<b>					BUGGIN' OUT
</b>		  I'll fuck you up quick two times.

<b>HERE WE GO!
</b>
<b>					BUGGIN' OUT
</b>		  Who told you to step on my sneakers?
		  Who told you to walk on my side of

<b>					CLIFTON
</b>		  I own a brownstone on this block.

<b>					BUGGIN' OUT
</b>		  Who told you to buy a brownstone on

The crowd likes that one and they laugh and egg him on.

<b>					BUGGIN' OUT
</b>		  What do you want to live in a Black
		  neighborhood for?  Motherfuck

</b>		  I'm under the assumption that this

AWWW SHIT!  Why did he get Buggin' started?

Buggin' Out looks down at his marred Air Jordans.  The
crowd, smelling blood, wants to see some.

</b>		  You're lucky the Black man has a

</b>		  He's dissing you.

</b>		  Damn, my brand-new Jordans.  You

<b>					BUGGIN' OUT
</b>		  And I--we--want some Black people up.

<b>					JADE
</b>		  Did you ask Sal?

</b>		  Yeah, I asked him.  I don't want
		  nobody in there, nobody spending

Jade looks at Buggin' Out like "Are you serious?"

<b>					JADE
</b>		  Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be

Sal moves behind the counter and goes to work.  Pino and
Mookie look at each other in agreement, neither likes what
he has seen.  This happens to Sal every time Jade is in
Sal's Famous Pizzeria.

Mother Sister does not answer.  He puts the flowers down.

He looks up at Mother Sister who immediately turns away.

different colored bottles of flavors.

through the crowd and hugs her baby.

</b>

<b>					EDDIE
</b>		  Mayor knocked me down.

<b>					LOUISE
</b>		  You should be ashamed of yourself.

</b>		  Ma'am, the boy is just scared to

		  that I was minding my business when
		  I saw your son about to be run over.
		  I ran into the street to save him
		  and I had to knock him down to keep
		  the both of us from getting hit.

The crowd agrees "That's the way it happened," and Louise
stands up.

<b>					LOUISE
</b>		  Eddie, is that the truth?

Eddie is quiet.

<b>					LOUISE

Eddie is still mum.

<b>					LOUISE

</b>		  I appreciate ya helping my Eddie.
		  I truly do, but I'll have nobody

<b>HOT CITY NIGHT MONTAGE
</b>
THE BLOCK.  WE'VE SEEN it at daytime, but now WE SEE it at
night.  Even though the white-hot sun is gone, nonetheless
the heat is still stifling.  And in a peculiar, funny sort
of way, it's worse.  You expect it to be hot during the
light of day when the sun is beating down on the cement and
tar, but at night it should be considerably cooler; well,
not tonight, it's hot.  All the residents of The Block: the
Corner Men, Mother Sister, Da Mayor, Jade, etc., all the
people WE'VE SEEN throughout the day are now coping with the
night-time heat, plus it's humid as shit.  Everyone is
outside, sitting on stoops, on cars and you know the kids
are playing, running up and down the block.  Now it's the
hottest night of the year.

		  Didn't even say please.  Who the

Sal is looking into the cash register.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  We did good business today.  We got
		  a good thing going.  Nothing like a
		  family in business working together.
		  One day the both of you will take

<b>ANGLE--VITO, PINO, AND MOOKIE
</b>
All three look at each other.  The horror is on their faces,
with the prospect of working, slaving in Sal's and Sons
Famous Pizzeria, trapped for the rest of their lives.  Is
this their future?  It's a frightening thought.

<b>ANGLE--DOOR

Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella enter.

<b>					SAL

<b>					AHMAD
</b>		  Just four slices, regular slices.

</b>		  You got it.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Good.  No joke.  We all wanna go
		  home.

OH NO!  We hear the dum-dum-dum of Radio Raheem's box.  As
everyone turns their heads to the door, Buggin' Out and
Radio Raheem are inside already.  We have never heard the
rap music as loud as it is now.  You have to scream to be
heard and that's what they do.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  What did I tell ya 'bout dat noise?

<b>					BUGGIN' OUT
</b>		  What did I tell ya 'bout dem

<b>					SAL
</b>		  What da fuck!  Are you deaf?

<b>					BUGGIN' OUT
</b>		  No, are you?  We want some Black
		  people up on the Wall of Fame.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Turn that JUNGLE MUSIC off.  We
		  ain't in Africa.

Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella start to dance while Mookie
takes a seat, the impartial observer that he is.

<b>					BUGGIN' OUT
</b>		  Why it gotta be about jungle music
		  and Africa?

<b>					SAL
</b>		  It's about turning that shit off
		  and getting the fuck outta my
		  pizzeria.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  Radio Raheem.

<b>					RADIO RAHEEM
</b>		  Fuck you.

<b>											    78.
</b>

<b>					SAL
</b>		  What ever happened to nice music
		  with words you can understand?

<b>					RADIO RAHEEM
</b>		  This is music.  My music.

<b>					VITO
</b>		  We're closed.

<b>					BUGGIN' OUT
</b>		  You're closed alright, till you get
		  some Black people up on that wall.

Sal grabs his Mickey Mantle bat from underneath the counter
and brings it down on Radio Raheem's box, again and again
and again.  The music stops.

<b>CLOSE--RADIO RAHEEM'S BOX
</b>
Radio Raheem's pride and joy is smashed to smithereens.
It's going to the junkyard quick.

<b>ANGLE--PIZZERIA
</b>
There is an eerie quiet as everyone is frozen, surprised by
the suddenness of Sal's action, the swings of his Mickey
Mantle bat.  All look at Radio Raheem and realize what is
about to happen.

<b>ANGLE--RADIO RAHEEM
</b>
Radio Raheem screams, he goes crazy.

<b>					RADIO RAHEEM
</b>		  My music!

Radio Raheem picks Sal up from behind the counter and starts
to choke his ass.  Radio Raheem's prized possession--his
box, the only thing he owned of value--his box, the one
thing that gave him any sense of worth--has been smashed to
bits. (Radio Raheem, like many Black youth, is the victim of
materialism and a misplaced sense of values.) Now he doesn't
give a fuck anymore.  He's gonna make Sal pay with his life.

Vito and Pino jump on Radio Raheem, who only tightens his
grip around Sal's neck.  Buggin' Out tries to help his
friend.  Mookie just stands and watches as Ahmad, Cee,
Punchy, and Ella cheerlead.

<b>											    79.

The cop cars come right through the crowd, almost running
over some people.  The cops get out with nightsticks and
guns drawn.  WE RECOGNIZE two of the faces, Officers Long
and Ponte.  Any time there is a skirmish between a Black man
and a white man, you can bet the house on who the copes are
gonna go for.  You know the deal!  Buggin' Out is pulled off
first, then Vito and Pino, but Radio Raheem is a crazed man.
It takes all six cops to pull him off Sal, who is red as a
beet from being choked.

Handcuffs are put on Buggin' Out as he watches the other

The officers pick up Radio Raheem's limp body and throw him
into the back seat.  Buggin' Out is pushed into another car.
The cop cars speed off; in their haste to beat it, they have
left the crowd.  It's at this point the crowd becomes an
angry mob.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  Where did you sleep?

<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  I didn't.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  I hope the block is still standing.

<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  We're still standing.

Da Mayor and Mother Sister both look out the parlor window
to see THE BLOCK and Mookie.

<b>EXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY
</b>
Mookie walks up to Sal's Famous Pizzeria as it still
smoulders in the morning light.  Sal emerges from the
wreckage; he looks like he might have slept there.

<b>											    90.
</b>

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Whatdafuck do you want?

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  I wants my money.  I wants to get
		  paid.

Sal looks at Mookie in disbelief.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Mookie, I always liked you.  Not
		  the smartest kid, but you're honest.
		  Don't make me dislike you.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Sal, I want my money.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Don't even ask about your money.
		  Your money wouldn't even pay for
		  that window you smashed.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Motherfuck a window, Radio Raheem
		  is dead.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  You're right, a kid is dead, but
		  Mook, this isn't the time.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Fuck dat.  The time is fuckin' now.
		  Y'know I'm sorry 'bout Sal's Famous
		  Pizzeria, but I gotta live, too. I
		  gotta get paid.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  We both do.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  We all know you're gonna get over
		  with the insurance money anyway!
		  Ya know da deal.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Do we now?

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Quit bullshitting.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  You don't know shit about shit.

<b>											    91.
</b>

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  I know I wants to get my money.

Sal has had it.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  How much?  How much do I owe you?

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  My salary.  Two-fifty.

Sal pulls out a wad and quickly peels off hundred dollar
bills.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  One, two, three, four, five.

Sal throws the "C" notes at Mookie, they hit him in the
chest and fall to the sidewalk.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Are you happy now?  That's five
		  fucking hundred dollars.  You just
		  got paid.  Mookie, you are a rich
		  man, now ya life is set, you'll
		  never have another worry, a care in
		  the world.  Mookie, ya wealthy, a
		  fuckin' Rockefeller.

Mookie is stunned by Sal's outburst.  He picks up the bills.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Ya just got paid, so leave me the
		  fuck alone.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  You only pay me two-fifty a week.
			    (he throws two "C"
			    notes back at him)
		  I owe you fifty bucks.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Keep it.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  You keep it.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Christmas came early.

Both look at the two hundred-dollar bills on the sidewalk
and refuse to pick them up.  It's a stalemate.

<b>											    92.
</b>

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  This is the hottest Christmas I've
		  known.

Mookie counts his money.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  It's supposed to be even hotter
		  today.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  You gonna open up another Sal's
		  Famous Pizzeria?

<b>					SAL
</b>		  No.  What are you gonna do?

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Make dat money.  Get paid.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Yeah!...I'm goin' to the beach for
		  the first day in fifteen years.
		  Gonna take the day off and go to
		  the beach.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  I can dig it.  It's gonna be HOT as
		  a motherfucker.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Mookie?

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Gotta go.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  C'mere, Doctor.

Mookie turns around and goes back.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Doctor, this is Sal talkin'.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b><b>		  OK.  OK.
</b>
<b>					SAL
</b>		  Doctor, always try to do the right
		  thing.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  That's it?

<b>											    93.
</b>

<b>					SAL
</b>		  That's it.

Mookie thinks about it, looks at the two "C" notes still
smiling up at him.  He quickly scoops them up.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  I got it.

<b>EXT: STREET--DAY
</b>
<b>HIGH ANGLE
</b>
As Mookie turns and walks away, Sal goes back into Sal's
Famous Pizzeria to salvage what is salvageable, and The
Block begins to awake from its slumber, ready to deal once
again with the heat of the hottest day of the year.

<b>								    FADE OUT.
