"The greatest miracle Christianity has achieved in America
is that the black man in white Christian hands has not grown
violent.  It is a miracle that 22 million black people have
not risen up against their oppressors--in which they would
have been justified by all moral criteria, and even by the
democratic tradition!  It is a miracle that a nation of
black people has so fervently continued to believe in a
turn-the-other-cheek and heaven-for-you-after-you-die
philosophy!  It is a miracle that the American Black people
have remained a peaceful people, while catching all the
centuries of hell that they have caught, here in white man's
heaven!  The miracle is that the white man's puppet Negro
'leaders,' his preachers and the educated Negroes laden with
degrees, and others who have been allowed to wax fat off
their black poor brothers, have been able to hold the black
masses quiet until now."

INT: WE LOVE RADIO STATION STOREFRONT--DAY

EXTREME CLOSE UP

WE SEE only big white teeth and very Negroidal (big) lips.

                         MISTER SEÑOR LOVE DADDY
            Waaaake up!
            Wake up!  Wake up!  Wake up!
            Up ya wake!  Up ya wake!  Up ya wake!

CAMERA MOVES BACK SLOWLY TO REVEAL MISTER SEÑOR LOVE DADDY,
a DJ, a radio personality, behind a microphone.


                         MISTER SEÑOR LOVE DADDY
            This is Mister Señor Love Daddy.
            Your voice of choice.  The world's
            only twelve-hour strongman, here on
            WE LOVE radio, 108 FM.  The last on
            your dial, but the first in ya
            hearts, and that's the truth, Ruth!

The CAMERA, which is STILL PULLING BACK, shows that Mister
Señor Love Daddy is actually sitting in a storefront window.
The control booth looks directly out onto the street.  This
is WE LOVE RADIO, a modest station with a loyal following,
right in the heart of the neighborhood.  The OPENING SHOT
will be a TRICK SHOT--the CAMERA PULLING BACK through the
storefront window.

                         MISTER SEÑOR LOVE DADDY
            Here I am.  Am I here?  Y'know it.
            It ya know.  This is Mister Señor
            Love Daddy, doing the nasty to ya
            ears, ya ears to the nasty.  I'se
            play only da platters dat matter,
            da matters dat platter and that's
            the truth, Ruth.

He hits the cart machine and we hear a station jingle.

                         VO
            L-O-V-E RADIO.

                         MISTER SEÑOR LOVE DADDY
            Doing da ying and yang da flip and
            flop da hippy and hoppy
                   (he yodels)
            Yo da lay he hoo.  I have today's
            forecast.
                   (he screams)
            HOT!

He laughs like a madman.

INT: DA MAYOR'S BEDROOM--DAY

An old, grizzled man stirs in the bed, his sheets are soaked
with sweat.  He flings them off his wet body.

                         DA MAYOR
            Damn, it's hot.

INT: JADE'S APARTMENT--DAY

CAMERA MOVES IN ON a young man sitting at the edge of a sofa
bed.

CLOSE UP--HIS SMALL HANDS

WE SEE him counting his money.  This isn't any ordinary
counting of money, he's straightening out all the corners of
the bills, arranging them so the bills--actually the "dead
presidents"--are facing the same way.  This is MOOKIE.  Once
he's finished with that task, counting his money, he sneaks
into his sister's bedroom.

INT: JADE'S BEDROOM--DAY

CLOSE UP--JADE

JADE, Mookie's sister, is fast asleep.  Mookie's fingers
ENTER THE FRAME and start to play with her lips.  Jade
pushes his hands away.  Mookie waits several beats and he
continues.  Jade wakes up--mad.

                         JADE
            Don't you have enough sense not to
            bother people when they're sleeping?

                         MOOKIE
            Wake up!

                         JADE
            Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day
            I get to sleep late.

                         MOOKIE
            It's gonna be hot today.

                         JADE
            Good!  Leave me alone when I'm
            sleeping.  I'm gonna get a lock on
            my door, to keep ya ass outta here.

                         MOOKIE
            Don't ya love ya brother Mookie
            anymore?  I loves ya, Jade.

                         JADE
            Do me a favor.  Go to work.

                         MOOKIE
            Later.  Gotta get paid.

He plants a big fat juicy on his sister's forehead.

EXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY

A 1975 El Dorado pulls up in front of the neighborhood
pizzeria--Sal's Famous Pizzeria.

From out of the car comes the owner, SAL, a slightly
overweight man in his early fifties, and his two sons, PINO,
22, and VITO, 20.  It's time for them to go to work at Sal's
Famous Pizzeria in the heart of Black Brooklyn.  Sal's sits
on the corner of The Block.  The Block being where this film
on the hottest day of the summer takes place.

Pino kicks a beer can in his path into the gutter.

                         SAL
            Pino, get a broom and sweep out
            front.

                         PINO
            Vito, get a broom and sweep out
            front.

                         VITO
            See, Pop.  That's just what I was
            talkin' about.  Every single time
            you tell Pino to do something, he
            gives it to me.

                         PINO
            He's nuts.

                         SAL
            The both of youse, shaddup.

                         VITO
            Tell Pino.

                         PINO
            Get the broom.

                         VITO
            I ain't getting shit.

                         SAL
            Hey!  Watch it.

                         PINO
            I didn't want to come to work
            anyway.  I hate this freakin' place.

                         SAL
            Can you do better?  C'mere.

Pino is now silent.  Sal walks over to him.


                         SAL
            Can you do better?
                   (he pops Pino upside
                   the head)
            I didn't think so.  This is a
            respectable business.  Nuthin'
            wrong with it.  Get dat broom.

                         PINO
            Tell Vito.

                         VITO
            Pop asked you.

                         SAL
            I'm gonna kill somebody today.

EXT: MOOKIE'S BROWNSTONE--DAY

Mookie comes down his stoop and walks to work.

EXT: STREET--DAY

The Block is beginning to come to life.  Those unlucky souls
who have to work this Saturday drag themselves to it, and
the kids are out on the street to play in the hot sun all
day long.

EXT: MOTHER SISTER'S STOOP--DAY

Mookie stops to say hello to MOTHER SISTER.  She leans out
her window on the parlor floor.  In the summertime, the only
time when she's not perched in her window is when she's
asleep.

                         MOTHER SISTER
            Good morning, Mookie.

                         MOOKIE
            Good morning to you.

                         MOTHER SISTER
            Now, Mookie, don't work too hard
            today.  The man said it's gonna be
            HOT as the devil.  I don't want ya
            falling out from the heat.  You
            hear me, son?

                         MOOKIE
            I hear ya, Mother Sister.  I hear
            you.


                         MOTHER SISTER
            Good.  I'll be watching ya, son.
            Mother Sister always watches.

INT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY

Mookie enters the pizzeria and Pino is on him before the
door closes.

                         PINO
            Mookie, late again.  How many times
            I gotta tell you?

                         MOOKIE
            Hello, Sal.  Hello, Vito.

                         SAL
            How ya doin', Mookie?

                         VITO
            Whaddup?

                         MOOKIE
            Just coolin'.

                         PINO
            You're still late.

                         SAL
            Pino, relax, will ya.

                         PINO
            Here, take the broom.  The front
            needs sweeping.

                         MOOKIE
            Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I
            just got here.  You sweep.  I
            betcha Sal asked you first anyhow.

                         VITO
            That's right.

                         PINO
            Shaddup, Vito.

                         MOOKIE
            Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas.
            That's what I get paid for.

                         PINO
            You get paid to do what we say.


                         MOOKIE
            What we say.  I didn't hear Sal say
            nuthin'.

Pino looks at his father.  He wants to be backed up on this;
all he gets is an amused look, and a smirk from Vito.

                         PINO
            Who's working for who?

There's a knock on the door and Da Mayor enters.

                         SAL
            Come on in, Mayor.

                         DA MAYOR
            Good morning, gentlemens.  It's
            gonna be a scorcher today, that's
            for sure.  Need any work done
            around here?

Sal looks at Pino, who reluctantly gives Da Mayor the broom.

                         DA MAYOR
            It will be the cleanest sidewalk in
            Brooklyn.  Clean as the Board of
            Health.

Da Mayor almost runs out of the pizzeria in his hurry; soon
as he finishes he'll be able to get a bottle.

                         PINO
            Pop, I don't believe this shit.  We
            runnin' welfare or somethin'?
            Every day you give dat bum--

                         MOOKIE
            Da Mayor ain't no bum.

                         PINO
            Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping
            our sidewalk.  What do we pay
            Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I
            work harder than him and I'm your
            own son.

                         MOOKIE
            Who don't work?  Let's see you
            carry six large pies up six flights
            of stairs.  No elevator either and
            shit.


                         SAL
            Both of youse--shaddup.  This is a
            place of business.

                         VITO
            Tell 'em, Pop.

                         PINO
            Me and you are gonna have a talk.

                         VITO
            Sez who?

                         PINO
            Sez me.

                         SAL
            Hey!  What did I say?

                         MOOKIE
            Who doesn't work?  Don't start no
            shit, won't be no shit.

                         SAL
            Mookie, no cursing in the store.

                         MOOKIE
            Talk to your son.

EXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY

Da Mayor sweeps the sidewalk, happy as can be.  As soon as
he finishes he can get that money and get that bottle.

EXT: STOOP--DAY

A group of youths sit on a stoop, waiting for someone.  They
are CEE, PUNCHY, and the lone female, ELLA.

                         ELLA
            What's keeping him?

                         PUNCHY
            You call him, then.

Ella stands up and yells.

                         ELLA
            Yo, Ahmad!

                         PUNCHY
            I coulda done dat.


                         ELLA
            Yo, Ahmad!

She looks up into his window, then sits down.

                         ELLA
            Punchy, if ya want to do some more
            screaming, be my guest.  I'm too
            through.

The door swings open at the top of the stoop and AHMAD
appears.

                         AHMAD
            Who's yelling my name?

                         ELLA
            Punchy told me to.

                         AHMAD
            Don't listen to him, it will get ya
            in trouble.

                         ELLA
            Heard that, Punchy.

Ahmad sits down with them.

                         AHMAD
            Ella, you have a brain, use it.

In the BG, we hear the dum-dum-dum of a giant box.  The
sound gets louder as the box gets closer.  The youths look
down the block and see a tall young man coming towards them.
He has a very distinct walk, it's more like a bop.  This is
RADIO RAHEEM.  The size of his box is tremendous and one has
to think, how does he carry something that big around with
him?  It must weigh a ton, and it seems like the sidewalk
shakes as the rap music blares out.  The song we hear is the
only one Radio Raheem plays.

MEDIUM SHOT--RADIO RAHEEM

Radio Raheem stops in front of the group, looks at them, and
turns down the volume.  It's quiet again.

                         RADIO RAHEEM
            Peace, y'all.

                         ELLA
            Peace, Radio Raheem.

                         CEE
            Peace.

                                                           10.


                         PUNCHY
            You the man, Radio Raheem.

                         AHMAD
            It's your world.

                         CEE
            In a big way.

Radio Raheem nods and turns up the volume.  Way up.

                         AHMAD
            My people.  My people.

EXT: WE LOVE STOREFRONT--DAY

Radio Raheem waves to Mister Señor Love Daddy as he walks by.

INT: WE LOVE CONTROL BOOTH--DAY

Mister Señor Love Daddy gives Radio Raheem a clenched-fist
salute.

EXT: FRUIT-N-VEG DELIGHT--DAY

Da Mayor walks into a newly opened fruit and vegetable deli
stand that is owned by Koreans.

INT: FRUIT-N-VEG DELIGHT--DAY

Da Mayor is looking for his beer in the refrigerated cases,
his ice-cold beer.

                         DA MAYOR
            Where's the Bud?  Where's the Bud?

                         KOREAN CLERK
            No mo' Bud.  You look what we have
            and buy.

                         DA MAYOR
            No more Bud.  What kind of joint is
            this?  How come no mo' Bud?  Doctor,
            this ain't Korea, China, or wherever
            you come from.  Get some Budweiser
            in this motherfucker.

                         KOREAN CLERK
            You buy 'nother beer.

                                                           11.


                         DA MAYOR
            Alright.  Alright.  Y'know you're
            asking a lot to make a man change
            his beer, that's asking a lot,
            Doctor.

EXT: MOTHER SISTER'S STOOP--DAY

Da Mayor has his can of beer (not Budweiser) and the brown
paper bag is twisted into a knot at the bottom.  He stops
and takes a long swig.

                         MOTHER SISTER
            You ole drunk.  What did I tell ya
            about drinking in front of my stoop?
            Move on, you're blocking my view.

Da Mayor lowers the can from his mouth and looks up at his
heckler.  It's obvious from the look on his face he's heard
this before.  Da Mayor contorts his face and stares at her.

                         MOTHER SISTER
            You ugly enough.  Don't stare at me.

Da Mayor changes his face into a more grotesque look.

                         MOTHER SISTER
            The evil eye doesn't work on me.

                         DA MAYOR
            Mother Sister, you've been talkin'
            'bout me the last eighteen years.
            What have I ever done to you?

                         MOTHER SISTER
            You're a drunk fool.

                         DA MAYOR
            Besides that.  Da Mayor don't
            bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother
            Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just
            mind his business.  I love everybody.
            I even love you.

                         MOTHER SISTER
            Hold your tongue.  You don't have
            that much love.

                         DA MAYOR
            One day you'll be nice to me.  We
            might both be dead and buried, but
            you'll be nice.  At least civil.

                                                           12.


Da Mayor tips his beat-up hat to Mother Sister and takes a
final swig of beer just for her.

INT: TINA'S APARTMENT--DAY

An elderly Puerto Rican woman, CARMEN, is telling off her
daughter TINA in Spanish.  Tina, having heard enough, closes
the door on her mother's ranting and raving.

ANGLE--TINA

Tina bends down and scoops her baby son HECTOR up from the
bed and holds him for dear life to her breasts.  She talks
to her son while walking around the room.

                         TINA
            Hector, I shouldn't be telling you
            this but you would find out sooner
            or later.  Ya father ain't no real
            father.  He's a bum, a two-bit bum
            in a hundred-dollar world.  Your
            father is to the curb.  You're
            smart.  I see that look on ya face.
            You're saying if he's such a bum
            why am I with him?  Good question.
            Like I said before, you're no dummy.
            He talked his way into my panties,
            I thought being a mother would make
            me happy, make me whole.  He's a
            mistake, but you are not.

Tina kisses her son.  Tina is seventeen years old, another
teenage parent.

EXT: STREET CORNER--DAY

Every day on this corner, summer or winter, spring or fall,
a small group of men meet.  They have no steady employment,
nothing they can speak of; they do, however, have the gift
of gab.  These man can talk, talk, and mo' talk, and when a
bottle is going round and they're feeling "nice," they get
philosophical.  These men become the great thinkers of the
world, with solutions to all its ills; like drugs, the
homeless, and AIDS.  They're called the Corner Men: SWEET
DICK WILLIE, COCONUT SID, and ML.  All three are sitting in
folding chairs up against a wall in the shade.

                         ML
            The way I see it, if this hot
            weather continues, it will surely
            melt the polar caps and the whole
            wide world--the parts that ain't
            water already--will be flooded.

                                                           13.

            Where did you read that?

                         ML
            Don't worry about it.  But when it
            happens and I'm in my boat and ya
            black ass is drowning, don't ask me
            to throw you a lifesaver either.

                         SWEET DICK WILLIE
            Fool, you're thirty cents away from
            a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat?

                         ML
            Don't worry about it.

                         SWEET DICK WILLIE
            You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat
            the holes out of donuts.

                         ML
            I'll be back on my feet.  Soon
            enough.

                         SWEET DICK WILLIE
            So when is all this ice suppose to
            melt?

INT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY

Customers are in Sal's; it's lunchtime and it's fairly busy.
Sal puts a hot slice down on the counter in front of BUGGIN'
OUT, a b-boy.

                         SAL
            You paying now or on layaway?

Buggin' Out looks at the slice.

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            How much?

                         SAL
            You come in here at least three
            times a day.  You a retard?  A buck
            fifty.

            Damn, Sal, put some more cheese on
            that motherfucker.

                         SAL
            Extra cheese is two dollars.
            Y'know dat.

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            Two dollars!  Forget it!

Buggin' Out slams his money down on the counter, takes his
slice and sits down.

ANGLE--TABLE

All around Buggin' Out, peering down from the WALL OF FAME,
are signed, framed, eight by ten glossies of famous Italian
Americans.  WE SEE Joe DiMaggio, Rocky Marciano, Perry Como,
Frank Sinatra, Luciano Pavarotti, Liza Minnelli, Governor
Mario Cuomo, Al Pacino and, of course, how can we forget
Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa: THE ITALIAN STALLION,
also RAMBO.

            Sal, that might be fine, you own
            this, but rarely do I see any
            Italian Americans eating in here.
            All I've ever seen is Black folks.
            So since we spend much money here,
            we do have some say.

                         SAL

Sal comes from behind the counter with his Louisville
Slugger Mickey Mantle model baseball bat.  Vito is by his
side, but Mookie intercepts them, and takes Buggin' Out
outside.

                         SAL

Mookie hands her the pizza.

                         MOOKIE
            No, it's not cold.  Twelve dollars
            for the pie.

Nilda hands him a handful of singles.  Mookie looks at the
crumpled mess.  Nilda attempts to close the door, but
Mookie's foot says, "Hell no."

                         MOOKIE
            Hold it.  Let me count this first.

First he straightens out the dollars, then counts the bills.

                         MOOKIE
            You're short.

                         NILDA
            I counted the twelve dollars myself.

            Look, lady.  I carried your pizza
            up five flights of stairs and shit.
            The cheese didn't slide over to one
            side like it sometimes does with
            delivery people who don't care.  I
            do care.  May I get paid?

Nilda looks at him and sees right away he's not going
anywhere.

                         NILDA
            Wait here.

                         MOOKIE

            now.  Where's the stuff?

Mother Sister hands her a bag that is at her side.

Jade unwraps a head scarf from around Mother Sister's head
and a full head of long black hair falls to her shoulders.

                         JADE
            This might take some time.

                         MOTHER SISTER
            I got nowhere to go.  We haven't
            had a good sit-down for a long while.

Jade begins to part, grease, and comb out Mother Sister's
hair.

            Tender-headed runs in my family.

            empire.  Needless to say what

too hot.  The kitchen is closed."

Men downing six-packs of ice-cold brew.

Faces stuck directly in front of fans.

A young kid cracks an egg on Sal's Cadillac.  The moment the
egg hits the car hood it starts to cook.  The kid looks
directly INTO THE CAMERA and smiles, then looks up to see
Sal, mad as a motherfucker, chasing after him.

And how can I forget the papers, the newspaper headlines.

                 New York Post: "A SCORCHER"
              New York Daily News: "2 HOT 4 U?"
          New York Newsday: "OH BOY!  BAKED APPLE"
         New York Times: "RECORD HEATWAVE HITS CITY"

EXT: STREET--DAY

CLOSE UP--JOHNNY PUMP

POW!  A powerful gush of water flies out RIGHT AT THE CAMERA.

Ahmad has just turned on the johnny pump and the white
stream of water flies across the street.

This attracts all the people of the block.  It's a chance to
cool off and momentarily beat the killer heat.

ANGLE--CEE AND PUNCHY

They both scrape beer cans on the sidewalk.

                                                           22.


ANGLE--ELLA

She stands with caution away from the fire hydrant.  Ella
does not want to get wet.

ANGLE--CEE AND PUNCHY

They're still scraping away.

ANGLE--STREET

Folks, young and old, begin to get in the water and play.

ANGLE--CEE AND PUNCHY

Both now have cans with the ends scraped away, and go to the
johnny pump.  Punchy bends down behind the hydrant and
places the can over the water.  The can now directs the
water into giant streams.

ANGLE--ELLA

Ahmad sneaks up behind Ella and picks her up.  She's kicking
and screaming furiously.

                         ELLA
            Ahmad!  Put me down!  Put me down!
            I can't get wet!  I'm not playing!

Ahmad is not having it.  He carries a kicking Ella into the
middle of the street in direct line of fire.

                         AHMAD
            Yo!

                         ELLA
            No!

They both are hit with a blast of water and are soaked to
the bone.  Ella starts to punch Ahmad, and chases after him.

ANGLE--STREET

We hear the familiar rap music of Radio Raheem's box.

CLOSE--RADIO RAHEEM

Radio Raheem is too cool.  By the way he's dressed, it could
be fall, not the hottest day of the year.  But you could
never tell it from him.  He's too cool.

CLOSE--RADIO RAHEEM

                                                           23.


Raheem looks at Cee, he wants to get by and he doesn't want
to get wet either.  And if his box gets wet, somebody is
gonna die.  Cee knows this too.

ANGLE--JOHNNY PUMP

Cee stands in front of the hydrant, blocking the water so
Radio Raheem can pass.

ANGLE--RADIO RAHEEM

He slowly bops across the street as all eyes watch.  When
he's clear, Cee moves and the water gushes out again as
folks play.

ANGLE--STREET

We hear a car horn blowing.  People move out of the way as
the vehicle speeds through the spray.

ANGLE--WHITE CONVERTIBLE

An older man, CHARLIE, stops his white convertible and blows
his horn.

                         CHARLIE
            I'm not playing.  There's gonna be
            trouble if you fuck around.

CLOSE--CEE AND PUNCHY

                         PUNCHY
            Go 'head.  You got it.  You got it.

CLOSE--CHARLIE

                         CHARLIE
            This is an expensive car.

CLOSE--CEE

                         CEE
            You won't get wet.

ANGLE--HYDRANT

Both Punchy and Cee sit in front of the hydrant once again,
blocking the water.

ANGLE--WHITE CONVERTIBLE

The car cautiously eases forward.  Charlie doesn't trust Cee
and Punchy at all.

                                                           24.


CLOSE--CHARLIE

                         CHARLIE
            I'm warning you.

CLOSE--CEE AND PUNCHY

                         PUNCHY
            C'mon.

                         CEE
            Hurry up.  We ain't got all day.

ANGLE--STREET

The people all move to the car, for they know what is about
to happen.

ANGLE--HYDRANT

Cee and Punchy leap off the hydrant, unleashing a jet blast
that flies directly into Charlie's car.  The whole block is
dying.

ANGLE--STREET

Charlie pulls his flooded car over to the curb, jumps out,
and runs to get hold of Cee and Punchy.  Of course, he's
slow, as the kids turn into track stars and make like Carl
Lewis.

ANGLE--STREET

Charlie, a wet mess, tries to buy some sympathy from the
folks; none is to be bought.

                         CHARLIE
            I'm fucking soaked.  If I ever
            catch those fucks they'll be sorry.
            Cocksucking sonabitches!

The ranting continues, and people laugh at him.

                         CHARLIE
            You people make me sick.

A cop car screeches to a halt in front of the man.  Two
officers, LONG and PONTE, get out.

                         CHARLIE
            Officers, I want an arrest made.
            Now.

                                                           25.


                         OFFICER PONTE
            What happened?

                         CHARLIE
            Two Black kids soaked me and my car.
            It's fucking ruined.

                         OFFICER LONG
            Where are they?

                         CHARLIE
            Where are they?  What kind of
            fucking asshole question is that?
            They ran the fuck away.

                         OFFICER PONTE
            Do you wish to file a complaint?

                         CHARLIE
            A complaint.  I want those fucks
            locked under the jail.

Officer Long goes into his car and gets a wrench.

ANGLE--JOHNNY PUMP

Officer Long turns off the hydrant, then puts the cap back on.

                         OFFICER PONTE
            This hydrant better not come back
            on or there's gonna be hell to pay.

                         CHARLIE
            What about my car?  I want justice.

Officer Long sides up to Da Mayor who's been looking on.

                         OFFICER LONG
            You know anything about this?

Da Mayor is quiet.

                         CHARLIE
            He knows.  He's a witness.  They
            all know.  He saw the whole thing.

Officer Ponte goes to Da Mayor's other side.

                         OFFICER LONG
            Who were the punks?

                         DA MAYOR
            Those who'll tell don't know.
            Those who know won't tell.

                                                           26.


                         OFFICER PONTE
            A wise guy.

Mookie emerges from the crowd and leads Da Mayor away from
the interrogation.

                         MOOKIE
            Let's go, Mayor.

                         OFFICER LONG
            Keep this hydrant off.  You want to
            swim, go to Coney Island.

                         CHARLIE
            He's leaving?  What about me?

                         OFFICER PONTE
            I suggest you get in your car
            quick, before these people start to
            strip it clean.

The man looks at the crowd of Blacks and Puerto Ricans
around him and he considers what he just heard.

                         OFFICER LONG
            Let's go, break it up.  Go back to
            your jobs.

                         OFFICER PONTE
            What jobs?

Both cops laugh.

ANGLE--STREET

Charlie drives away, fuming.

Cee and Punchy look down from a roof on all the havoc and
confusion they've started.  Both laugh.

Mookie enters.

            Mookie, what took you so long?  I
            got a business to run.

                         MOOKIE
            Run it then.

He gives Mookie a bag full of food.

            Pop, I'm gonna go with Mookie.

                         SAL
            Good, make sure he don't jerk around.

                         PINO
            Yeah, hurry back, it's getting
            crowded.

EXT: STREET--DAY

Vito and Mookie walk down the block.

            Mister Señor Love Daddy is cool.

                         MOOKIE

            Y'know, Vito, I know Pino is ya
            brother and shit, but the next time
            he hits ya, the next time he
            touches ya, you should "house him."
            Kick his ass.

                         VITO
            I don't know.

                         MOOKIE
            If you don't make a stand, he's
            gonna be beating ya like a egg for
            the rest of your life.

                         VITO
            That's what you think?

                         MOOKIE
            That's what I think.

                         VITO
            I don't like to fight.

                                                           28.

            touch you again.

EXT: WE LOVE RADIO--DAY

Mookie and Vito wave at Mister Señor Love Daddy through the
storefront window and he buzzes them in.

INT: CONTROL BOOTH--DAY

Mookie and Vito very quietly walk in; the man is on the air.

                         MISTER SEÑOR LOVE DADDY
            Peoples, my stomach's been grumbling
            but help has arrived.  My main man
            Mookie has saved the day, straight
            from Sal's Famous Pizzeria, down
            the block.  Come up to the mike,
            Mookie.

Mookie goes to the mike.

                         MISTER SEÑOR LOVE DADDY
            C'mon, don't be shy.  Mmm, smells
            good.  This is ya Love Daddy
            talkin' to ya, starvin' like Marvin.
            Say something, Mookie.

                         MOOKIE
            Mister Señor Love Daddy, I'd like
            to dedicate the next record to my

EXT: STREET--DAY

On a stoop, a group of Puerto Ricans sits talking, drinking
cerveza frío, and playing dominoes.  One of their cars is
parked near the stoop, and blasts salsa music.

ANGLE--RADIO RAHEEM

As usual we hear the rap music of Radio Raheem, but
underneath the salsa music.  Radio Raheem does not like to
be bested; the salsa music from the parked car is giving him
competition, this is no good.  Radio Raheem stands in front
of the stoop and raises his decibel level.

ANGLE--STOOP

The Puerto Rican men look at him, then begin to yell at him
in Spanish.  There is a standoff, the rap and salsa clashing
in a deafening roar.  One of the men, STEVIE, gets off the
stoop and goes to the car.

ANGLE--CAR

Stevie turns the car radio off.

CLOSE--RADIO RAHEEM

Radio Raheem smiles, nods, turns his box to a reasonable
listening level, and bops down the block.  Radio Raheem
still the loudest.  Radio Raheem still the king.

                                                           30.


                         STEVIE
            You got it, bro.

ANGLE--STOOP

The men curse in Spanish and shake their heads in
bewilderment and Stevie turns the salsa back on.

EXT: STREET--DAY

Vito and Mookie see Buggin' Out on their way back to Sal's.

                         MOOKIE
            You the man.

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            You the man.

                         MOOKIE
            No, you the man.

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            No.  I'm just a struggling Black
            man trying to keep my dick hard in
            a cruel and harsh world.

Buggin' Out gives Mookie five and a menacing look at Vito.

                         MOOKIE
            Vito is down.

EXT: STREET--DAY

Buggin' Out is walking down the block when CLIFTON, a
yuppie, accidentally bumps into him, stepping on his new
sneakers.

CLOSE--BUGGIN' OUT

He looks at his sneakers.

There is a big black smudge on his new white unlaced Air
Jordans.

ANGLE--BUGGIN' OUT

He runs down the block after Clifton.

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            Yo!

Clifton turns around.

                                                           31.

            Yo!

                         CLIFTON
            Yes?

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            You almost knocked me down.  The
            word is "excuse me."

                         CLIFTON
            Excuse me.  I'm very sorry.

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            Not only did you knock me down, you
            stepped on my new white Air Jordans
            that I just bought and that's all
            you can say, "Excuse me?"

This commotion has attracted a crowd, including Ahmad, Cee,
Punchy, and Ella.

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            I'll fuck you up quick two times.

HERE WE GO!

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            Who told you to step on my sneakers?
            Who told you to walk on my side of
            the block?  Who told you to be in
            my neighborhood?

                         CLIFTON
            I own a brownstone on this block.

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            Who told you to buy a brownstone on
            my block, in my neighborhood on my
            side of the street?

The crowd likes that one and they laugh and egg him on.

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            What do you want to live in a Black
            neighborhood for?  Motherfuck
            gentrification.

                         CLIFTON
            I'm under the assumption that this
            is a free country and one can live
            where he pleases.

                                                           32.


                         BUGGIN' OUT
            A free country?

AWWW SHIT!  Why did he get Buggin' started?

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            I should fuck you up just for that
            stupid shit alone.

Buggin' Out looks down at his marred Air Jordans.  The
crowd, smelling blood, wants to see some.

                         AHMAD
            Your Jordans are dogged.

                         CEE
            You might as well throw 'em out.

                         PUNCHY
            They looked good before he messed
            them up.

                         ELLA
            You used to be so fine.

                         AHMAD
            How much did you pay for them?

                         CEE

Da Mayor stands up from his seat cushion on the stoop.

            What do you have to say?

                         DA MAYOR
            What do you know 'bout me?  Y'all
            can't even pee straight.  What do
            you know?  Until you have stood in

            your five children, unable to do a

            bum, don't call me a drunk, you
            don't know me, and it's
            disrespectful.  I know your parents

The teenagers look at Da Mayor.

Da Mayor sits back down on his seat cushion on his stoop.

            Prince are not niggers, I mean, are

            think.  Vito, what do you say?

                         PINO
            Y'know, I've been listening and
            reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't
            know that, did you?

                         MOOKIE
            I didn't know you could read.

                         PINO
            Fuck you.  Anyway, Minister
            Farrakhan always talks about the
            so-called "day" when the Black man
            will rise.  "We will one day rule
            the earth as we did in our glorious
            past."  You really believe that shit?

                         MOOKIE
            It's e-vit-able.

                         PINO

Radio Raheem approaches Mookie.

                         MOOKIE
            Whaddup.  Money?

                         RADIO RAHEEM
            I was going to buy a slice.

                         MOOKIE
            I'll be back after I make this
            delivery.

                         RADIO RAHEEM
            On the rebound.

Mookie stares at the gold "brass knuckles" rings Radio
Raheem wears on each hand.  Spelled out across the rings are
the words "LOVE" on the right hand and "HATE" on the left
hand.

                         MOOKIE
            That's the dope.

                         RADIO RAHEEM
            I just copped them.  Let me tell
            you the story of Right-Hand--Left-
            Hand--the tale of Good and Evil.

                         MOOKIE
            I'm listening.

                         RADIO RAHEEM
            HATE!

He thrusts up his left hand.

                         RADIO RAHEEM
            It was with this hand that Brother
            Cain iced his brother.  LOVE!

He thrusts up his right hand.

                         RADIO RAHEEM
            See these fingers, they lead
            straight to the soul of man.  The
            right hand.  The hand of LOVE!

Mookie is buggin'.

                         RADIO RAHEEM
            The story of Life is this...

He locks his fingers and writhes, cracking the joints.

                                                           46.


                         RADIO RAHEEM
            STATIC!  One hand is always fighting
            the other.  Left Hand Hate is
            kicking much ass and it looks like
            Right Hand Love is finished.  Hold
            up.  Stop the presses!  Love is
            coming back, yes, it's Love.  Love
            has won.  Left Hand Hate KO'ed by
            Love.

Mookie doesn't know what to say, so he doesn't say anything.

                         RADIO RAHEEM
            Brother, Mookie, if I love you I
            love you, but if I hate you...

                         MOOKIE
            I understand.

                         RADIO RAHEEM
            I love you, my brother.

            So what if this is a Black
            neighborhood, so what if we're a

EXT: WE LOVE RADIO--DAY

Buggin' Out waves at Mister Señor Love Daddy as he walks by
the storefront.

INT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY

Buggin' Out sticks his head in and yells:

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            Sal, we're gonna boycott ya fat ass.

Before Sal and his two sons can answer, Buggin' Out is gone.

EXT: STREET--DAY

Buggin' Out has one foot up on a fire hydrant and tries to
clean his soiled Air Jordan.

ANGLE--JADE AND MOOKIE

Jade and Mookie walk up to Buggin' Out.

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            It's so nice to see a family
            hanging out together.

                         MOOKIE
            We're not hanging out.  I'm being
            escorted back to work.

                         JADE
            That's not even true.  I just want
            a slice.

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            Jade, you don't know this, but I'm
            organizing a boycott of Sal's
            Famous Pizzeria.

                         JADE
            What did he do this time?

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            Y'know all those pictures he has
            hanging on the Wall of Fame?

                         JADE
            So?

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            Have you noticed something about
            them?

                                                           53.


                         JADE
            No.

                         MOOKIE
                   (interjects)
            Yo, I'm gone.

                         JADE
            I'll see ya there.

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            Peace.

Mookie leaves.

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            Every single one of those pictures
            is somebody Italian.

                         JADE
            And?

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            And I--we--want some Black people up.

                         JADE
            Did you ask Sal?

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            Yeah, I asked him.  I don't want
            nobody in there, nobody spending
            good money in Sal's.  He should get
            no mo' money from the community
            till he puts some Black faces up on
            that motherfucking wall.

Jade looks at Buggin' Out like "Are you serious?"

                         JADE
            Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be
            disrespectful, but you can really
            direct your energies in a more
            useful way.

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            So, in other words, you are not down.

                         JADE
            I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            Jade, I still love you.

                                                           54.


                         JADE
            I still love you too.

INT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY

                         SAL
            Mookie, you are pushing it.  You're
            really pushing it.  I'm not paying
            you good money to fucking jerk me
            around.

Mookie has nothing to say.

                         SAL
            You're gonna be in the street with
            the rest of your homeboys.

                         PINO
            'Bout time, Pop.

ANGLE--DOOR

Jade enters, and Sal looks up.  He stops blasting Mookie and
a very noticeable change comes over him.

                         SAL
            Jade, we've been wondering when ya
            would pay us a visit.

                         JADE
            Hi, Sal, Pino, Vito.

                         JADE
            What's happening, Jade?

                         JADE
            Nuthin' really.  How are you
            treating my brother?

                         SAL
            The Mook?  Great.  Mookie's a good
            kid.

                         PINO
            Pop, stop lying.

                         SAL
            Shaddup!  Jade, what can I fix you?

                         JADE
            What's good?

                                                           55.


                         SAL
            Everything, but for you I'm gonna
            make up something special.  Take a
            seat.  There, that's a clean table.

Sal moves behind the counter and goes to work.  Pino and
Mookie look at each other in agreement, neither likes what
he has seen.  This happens to Sal every time Jade is in
Sal's Famous Pizzeria.

ANGLE--TABLE

Vito sits down with Jade.

                         JADE
            You still letting Pino push you
            around?

                         VITO
            Who told you that?  He doesn't push
            me, who told you, Mookie tell you
            that?  I hold my own.

                         JADE
            Forget about it, Vito.  Forget I
            even brought it up.

                         VITO
            Pino picks on me, but I don't let
            him push me around.  Mookie tell
            you that?

                         JADE
            Alright already.

EXT: ROOFTOP--DUSK

The once white-hot sun is now turning into a golden orange
glaze as it begins to set.  Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella
dance on the roof around a box that is turned into WE LOVE.
Each one is trying to come up with some new moves, a new
dance, and a name for it.

EXT: STREET--DUSK

Radio Raheem is walking down the block and there is something
wrong, something is not quite right.  AHA!  His music is not
loud; the rap song begins to drag and finally stops
altogether.

CLOSE--RADIO RAHEEM

He looks at his box and presses the battery level indicator.

                                                           56.

Da Mayor is looking at a bunch of cut flowers when Radio
Raheem comes out with batteries in hand--finally.

EXT: MOTHER SISTER'S STOOP--DUSK

ANGLE--WINDOW

Mother Sister is sitting in her window as usual.

ANGLE--STOOP

Da Mayor walks up the stoop with a bunch of fresh-cut
flowers in a discarded wine bottle for a vase.

ANGLE--DA MAYOR

Da Mayor holds them out for Mother Sister, who does not
acknowledge him at all.

                         DA MAYOR
            I'd thought you might like these...
            I guess not.

Da Mayor takes a seat on the stoop and puts the flowers to
his face.

                         DA MAYOR
            Ain't nuthin' like the smell of
            fresh flowers.  Don't you agree,
            Miss Mother Sister?

Mother Sister does not answer.  He puts the flowers down.

                         DA MAYOR
            Summertime, all ya can smell is the
            garbage.  Stink overpowers
            everything, especially soft sweet
            smells like flowers.

He looks up at Mother Sister who immediately turns away.

                         DA MAYOR
            If you don't mind, I'm gonna set
            right here, catch a breeze or two,
            then be on my way.

Da Mayor looks up at the setting sun.

                                                           58.


                         DA MAYOR
            Thank the Lord, the sun is going

CLOSE--SUN

The sun is an orange and purple glaze.

EXT: STREET--DUSK

Radio Raheem is back in action.  He's alive, he's bad and he
got his twenty "D" Duracell batteries, his box is kicking.

ANGLE--CORNER

Radio Raheem bops by Coconut Sid, ML, and Sweet Dick Willie.

CLOSE--COCONUT SID, ML, and SWEET DICK WILLIE

All three shake their heads in bewilderment as Radio Raheem
goes by.

                         ML
            What can you say?

                         COCONUT SID
            I don't know how he does it.

Sweet Dick Willie gets up from his chair and goes to the
corner, zips down his pants, and urinates.

                         SWEET DICK WILLIE
            ML?

                         ML
            What?

                         SWEET DICK WILLIE
            ML, hold this for me.

Sweet Dick Willie and Coconut Sid laugh.

                         ML
            That's OK.  At least my moms didn't
            name me Sweet Dick Willie.

Sweet Dick Willie zips up his pants and returns to his seat.

                         SWEET DICK WILLIE
            Why you gotta talk 'bout my moms?

                         ML
            Nobody talkin' 'bout ya moms.

                                                           59.


                         SWEET DICK WILLIE
            I didn't say nobody, I said you.

                         ML
            Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like
            that.

                         SWEET DICK WILLIE
            Yes you did.

                         COCONUT SID
            Squash it.

                         ML
            I just wanted to know who named ya
            Sweet Dick Willie?

                         SWEET DICK WILLIE
            It's just a name.

                         COCONUT SID
            And what does ML stand for?

                         ML
            ML stands for ML.  That's it.

                         SWEET DICK WILLIE
            Naw, that's some stupid shit.  Now
            you know how I got that name.

                         ML
            Negroes kill me, always holdin'
            onto, talkin' 'bout their dicks.

                         COCONUT SID
            I don't know 'bout you, but it's
            too hot to fuck.

                         SWEET DICK WILLIE
            Never too hot, never too cold for
            fucking.

EXT: STREET--DUSK

An old Puerto Rican man rings a bell as he pushes a cart on
wheels.  On the side of the cart is hand-lettered HELADO DE
COCO, and a big block of ice rests on top surrounded by
different colored bottles of flavors.

ANGLE--CART

A group of kids eagerly waits for the ices.  The man scrapes
the block of ice, puts the shavings in a paper cup, and
drowns it with syrup.

                                                           60.


ANGLE--DA MAYOR

Da Mayor is walking down the street.

ANGLE--MISTER SOFTEE TRUCK

We hear the familiar tune from the Mister Softee truck as it
comes down the street.

ANGLE--EDDIE LOVELL

Eddie, the young kid who earlier ran an errand for Da Mayor,
looks up from the sidewalk where he's playing and runs out
into the street in pursuit of Mister Softee.

                         EDDIE
            Ice cream.  Ice cream.

Eddie is running in pursuit of the truck, unaware of the
oncoming speeding car.

ANGLE--DA MAYOR

Da Mayor sees speeding car bearing down on Eddie.

ANGLE--STREET

Da Mayor runs across the street and knocks Eddie down, out
of the way of the car.  Both are thrown as they are hit by
the reckless driver.

CLOSE--EDDIE AND DA MAYOR

Eddie is crying as Da Mayor picks him up.

                         DA MAYOR
            Doctor, you know better to run out
            in the street... Stop crying, son.

ANGLE--STREET

A crowd gathers.

                         DA MAYOR
            Doctor, there's nothing to cry
            about.  You're OK.

A woman in her twenties, LOUISE, Eddie's mother, breaks
through the crowd and hugs her baby.

                         LOUISE
            What's wrong?

                                                           61.


                         EDDIE
            Mayor knocked me down.

                         LOUISE
            You should be ashamed of yourself.

                         DA MAYOR
            Ma'am, the boy is just scared to
            death.  What actually happened is
            that I was minding my business when
            I saw your son about to be run over.
            I ran into the street to save him
            and I had to knock him down to keep
            the both of us from getting hit.

The crowd agrees "That's the way it happened," and Louise
stands up.

                         LOUISE
            Eddie, is that the truth?

Eddie is quiet.

                         LOUISE
            Eddie, you hear me talkin' to you?

Eddie is still mum.

                         LOUISE
            I'm talkin' to you, boy.

                         DA MAYOR
            Miss, the boy is fine.

WHAP!  Louise hits Eddie on da butt.  Eddie starts to dance,
as his mother hits hard; she's heavy-handed.

                         LOUISE
            What I tell you 'bout lying?

WHOP!

                         LOUISE
            What did I tell you 'bout playing
            in the street?

WHAP!

                         EDDIE
            Mommy!  Mommy!  I'm sorry.  I'm
            sorry.

WHOP!

                                                           62.


                         LOUISE
            Get upstairs now.

Eddie runs away.

                         LOUISE
            And when your father comes home,
            he's gonna wear ya little narrow
            behind out too.

                         DA MAYOR
            You didn't have to hit your son;
            he's scared to death as it was.

                         LOUISE
            I appreciate ya helping my Eddie.
            I truly do, but I'll have nobody
            question how I raise him, not even
            his Daddy.

                         DA MAYOR
            You're right.

Louise goes away, probably to give her son another

            Sal, that was delicious.

            Stop tripping.

            No, you're tripping.  Don't come in
            Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.

                         JADE
            What are you so worked up about?

                         MOOKIE
            Over Sal, the way he talks and the
            way he looks at you.

                         JADE
            He's just being nice.

                         MOOKIE
            Nice!

                         JADE
            He's completely innocent.

                         MOOKIE
            Innocent!

                         JADE
            I didn't stutter.  You heard me.

                         MOOKIE
            You should see the way he looks at
            you.  All Sal wants to do is hide
            the salami.

                         JADE
            You are too crude.

            I'm a grown woman.  You gotta lotta
            nerve.  Mookie, you can hardly pay
            your rent and you're gonna tell me
            what to do.  Come off it.

            One has nuthin' to do with the other.

                         JADE
            Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your
            little 250 dollars a week plus
            tips...

            Pretty soon I'll be making a move.

            I wasn't trying to be a hero.  I
            saw what was about to happen and I
            reacted, didn't even think.  If I
            did, I might not have done it in
            second thought.  Da Mayor is an old

            Vito, Pino, see ya later.

The officers leave just as Mookie enters.

            Sal, if you want me to deliver any
            faster, get me a jet rocket or
            something, cuz I can't run with
            pizzas, all the cheese ends up on
            one side and shit.

                         SAL
            I didn't say nuthin'.  You must
            have a guilty conscience.  What are
            you guilty of?

                         MOOKIE
            I'm not guilty of nuthin'.

                         SAL
            You must be guilty of something or
            you would have never come in saying
            the things you said.

                         MOOKIE
            C'mon, Sal.

                         SAL
            Where we goin'?

While Sal laughs at his corny joke, Pino pulls Vito into the
back.

INT: STOREROOM--NIGHT

                         PINO
            Vito, I want you to listen to me.
            I'm your brother.  I may smack you
            around once in awhile, boss you
            around, but I'm still your brother.

                                                           73.


                         VITO
            I know this.

                         PINO
            I love you.

                         VITO
            I'm listening.

                         PINO
            Good.  I want you to listen.

                         VITO
            Jesus Christ on the cross, I said
            I'm listening.

                         PINO
            Good.  Vito, you trust that Mook
            too much.  So does Pop.

                         VITO
            Mookie's OK.

                         PINO
            You listening to me?

                         VITO
            Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm
            listening ten fucking times already.

                         PINO
            Mookie is not to be trusted.  No
            Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The
            first time you turn your back,
            boom, a knife right here.
                   (Pino gestures)
            In the back.

                         VITO
            How do you know this?

                         PINO
            I know.

                         VITO
            You really think so?

                         PINO
            I know so.  He, them, they're not
            to be trusted.

                         VITO
            So what do you want me to do?

                                                           74.


                         PINO
            Be on guard.  Mookie has Pop conned
            already, so we have to look out for
            him.

                         VITO
            I like Mookie a lot.

                         PINO
            And that's exactly what I'm talkin'
            'bout.

                         SAL (OS)
            Vito!  Pino!  Let's go.

                         PINO
            Be right there, Pop.  Listen to
            what I said.

                         VITO
            You don't listen to me, never have.
            Just run your big fucking mouth
            always playing big brother.  You
            don't listen, but Mookie does.

HOT CITY NIGHT MONTAGE

THE BLOCK.  WE'VE SEEN it at daytime, but now WE SEE it at
night.  Even though the white-hot sun is gone, nonetheless
the heat is still stifling.  And in a peculiar, funny sort
of way, it's worse.  You expect it to be hot during the
light of day when the sun is beating down on the cement and
tar, but at night it should be considerably cooler; well,
not tonight, it's hot.  All the residents of The Block: the
Corner Men, Mother Sister, Da Mayor, Jade, etc., all the
people WE'VE SEEN throughout the day are now coping with the
night-time heat, plus it's humid as shit.  Everyone is
outside, sitting on stoops, on cars and you know the kids
are playing, running up and down the block.  Now it's the
hottest night of the year.

EXT: STREET--NIGHT

Buggin' Out sits down on a car next to Radio Raheem; as
usual, his box is blasting.

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            How you be?

                         RADIO RAHEEM
            I be.  I'm living large.

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            Is that the only tape you got?

                                                           75.


                         RADIO RAHEEM
            You don't like Public Enemy?  It's
            the dope shit.

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            I like 'em, but you don't play
            anything else.

                         RADIO RAHEEM
            I don't like anything else.

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            Check this out.  Y'know Sal's.

                         RADIO RAHEEM
            Yeah, I know dat motherfucker.

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            I'm trying to organize a boycott of
            Sal's pizza joint.  Ya see what I'm
            saying?

                         RADIO RAHEEM
            I almost had to yoke him this
            afternoon.  Tell me, tell me, Radio
            Raheem, to turn my music down.
            Didn't even say please.  Who the
            fuck he think he is?  Don Corleone
            and shit.

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            He makes all his money off us Black
            people and I don't see nuthin' but
            Italians all up in there, Sylvester
            Stallone and motherfuckers.  Ya see
            what I'm saying, homeboy?

                         RADIO RAHEEM
            Talk to me.

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            We shouldn't buy a single slice,
            spend a single penny in that
            motherfucker till some people of
            color are put up in there.

                         RADIO RAHEEM
            That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
            That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            You got my back.

                                                           76.


                         RADIO RAHEEM
            Ya back is got.

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            My brother.

                         RADIO RAHEEM
            My brother.

INT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--NIGHT

Vito, Pino and Mookie are cleaning up.

                         MOOKIE
            Sal, it's almost quitting time so
            please start counting my pay.  I
            gotta get paid.

Sal is looking into the cash register.

                         SAL
            We did good business today.  We got
            a good thing going.  Nothing like a
            family in business working together.
            One day the both of you will take
            over...and Mookie, there will
            always be a place for you at Sal's
            Famous Pizzeria.  Y'know, it should
            be Sal's and Sons Famous Pizzeria.

ANGLE--VITO, PINO, AND MOOKIE

All three look at each other.  The horror is on their faces,
with the prospect of working, slaving in Sal's and Sons
Famous Pizzeria, trapped for the rest of their lives.  Is
this their future?  It's a frightening thought.

ANGLE--DOOR

Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella enter.

                         SAL
            We're about to close.

                         AHMAD
            Just four slices, regular slices.
            Please.  To go!

                         SAL
            OK, but that's it.  It's been a
            long day.

Mookie goes over to the table where Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and
Ella sit.

                                                           77.


                         MOOKIE
            Look, I want you to get your
            slices, then outta here.  No
            playing around.

                         AHMAD
            You got it.

                         MOOKIE
            Good.  No joke.  We all wanna go
            home.

OH NO!  We hear the dum-dum-dum of Radio Raheem's box.  As
everyone turns their heads to the door, Buggin' Out and
Radio Raheem are inside already.  We have never heard the
rap music as loud as it is now.  You have to scream to be
heard and that's what they do.

                         SAL
            What did I tell ya 'bout dat noise?

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            What did I tell ya 'bout dem
            pictures?

                         SAL
            What da fuck!  Are you deaf?

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            No, are you?  We want some Black
            people up on the Wall of Fame.

                         SAL
            Turn that JUNGLE MUSIC off.  We
            ain't in Africa.

Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella start to dance while Mookie
takes a seat, the impartial observer that he is.

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            Why it gotta be about jungle music
            and Africa?

                         SAL
            It's about turning that shit off
            and getting the fuck outta my
            pizzeria.

                         PINO
            Radio Raheem.

                         RADIO RAHEEM
            Fuck you.

                                                           78.


                         SAL
            What ever happened to nice music
            with words you can understand?

                         RADIO RAHEEM
            This is music.  My music.

                         VITO
            We're closed.

                         BUGGIN' OUT
            You're closed alright, till you get
            some Black people up on that wall.

Sal grabs his Mickey Mantle bat from underneath the counter
and brings it down on Radio Raheem's box, again and again
and again.  The music stops.

CLOSE--RADIO RAHEEM'S BOX

Radio Raheem's pride and joy is smashed to smithereens.
It's going to the junkyard quick.

ANGLE--PIZZERIA

There is an eerie quiet as everyone is frozen, surprised by
the suddenness of Sal's action, the swings of his Mickey
Mantle bat.  All look at Radio Raheem and realize what is
about to happen.

ANGLE--RADIO RAHEEM

Radio Raheem screams, he goes crazy.

                         RADIO RAHEEM
            My music!

Radio Raheem picks Sal up from behind the counter and starts
to choke his ass.  Radio Raheem's prized possession--his
box, the only thing he owned of value--his box, the one
thing that gave him any sense of worth--has been smashed to
bits. (Radio Raheem, like many Black youth, is the victim of
materialism and a misplaced sense of values.) Now he doesn't
give a fuck anymore.  He's gonna make Sal pay with his life.

Vito and Pino jump on Radio Raheem, who only tightens his
grip around Sal's neck.  Buggin' Out tries to help his
friend.  Mookie just stands and watches as Ahmad, Cee,
Punchy, and Ella cheerlead.

                                                           79.


EXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--NIGHT

The tangled mass of choking, biting, kicking, screaming
confusion flies through the door of Sal's out onto the
sidewalk.

CLOSE--EDDIE

The kid yells:

                         EDDIE
            Fight!  Fight!

                                            CUT TO:

He also looks up.

ANGLE--STREET

The people on The Block run to Sal's Famous Pizzeria to see
the STATIC.

ANGLE--SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA

Radio Raheem, Buggin' Out, Sal, Vito, and Pino are still
entangled, rolling around on the sidewalk, but now before an
entertained crowd of onlookers:

ANGLE--DA MAYOR

                         DA MAYOR
            Break it up.  This is crazy.

The fight continues.  Da Mayor is smart enough not to get in
the middle of this war.  We hear sirens, somebody has called
DA COPS.

ANGLE--STREET

                                                           80.


The cop cars come right through the crowd, almost running
over some people.  The cops get out with nightsticks and
guns drawn.  WE RECOGNIZE two of the faces, Officers Long
and Ponte.  Any time there is a skirmish between a Black man
and a white man, you can bet the house on who the copes are
gonna go for.  You know the deal!  Buggin' Out is pulled off
first, then Vito and Pino, but Radio Raheem is a crazed man.
It takes all six cops to pull him off Sal, who is red as a
beet from being choked.

ANGLE--COPS

Handcuffs are put on Buggin' Out as he watches the other
cops put a choke hold on Radio Raheem to restrain him.

ANGLE--RADIO RAHEEM

Radio Raheem is still struggling, then he just stops, his
body goes limp and he falls to the sidewalk like a fifty-
pound bag of Idaho potatoes.

ANGLE--STREET

Officers Long and Ponte kick him.

                         OFFICER LONG
            Get up!  Get up!

Radio Raheem just lies there like a bump on a log.

ANGLE--CROWD

The crowd stares at Radio Raheem's still body.  He's
unconscious or dead.

CLOSE--OFFICER LONG

                         OFFICER LONG
            Quit faking.

ANGLE--STREET

The officers all look at each other.  They know, they know
exactly what they've done.  The infamous Michael Stewart
choke hold.

                         OFFICER PONTE
            Let's get him outta here.

The officers pick up Radio Raheem's limp body and throw him
into the back seat.  Buggin' Out is pushed into another car.
The cop cars speed off; in their haste to beat it, they have
left the crowd.  It's at this point the crowd becomes an
angry mob.

                                                           81.


ANGLE--MOB

The mob looks at...

ANGLE--MOB POV

Sal still on the sidewalk, being helped to his feet by Vito
and Pino, who are in bad shape themselves.

ANGLE--MOB

The mood/tone of the mob is getting ugly.  Once again they
have seen one of their own killed before their eyes at the
hands of the cops.  We hear the murmurs of the folks go
through the crowd.

                         VOICES OF MOB
            THEY KILLED HIM
            THEY KILLED RADIO RAHEEM
            IT'S MURDER
            DID IT AGAIN
            JUST LIKE THEY DID MICHAEL STEWART
            MURDER
            ELEANOR BUMPERS
            MURDER
            IT'S NOT SAFE
            NOT EVEN IN OUR OWN NEIGHBORHOOD
            IT'S NOT SAFE
            NEVER WAS
            NEVER WILL BE

The cops, in their haste to get Radio Raheem out of there,
have left an angry mob of Black folks with a defenseless
Sal, Vito, and Pino.

The mob looks at them.

                         VOICES OF MOB
            WON'T STAND FOR IT
            THE LAST TIME
            FUCKIN' COPS
            THE LAST TIME

Mookie looks at the crowd and notices he's on the wrong side.
He leaves Sal and his two sons.

Da Mayor walks in front of the crowd.

                                                           82.


                         DA MAYOR
            Good people, let's all go home.
            Somebody's gonna get hurt.

                         CROWD (OS)
            Yeah, you!

                         DA MAYOR
            If we don't stop this now, we'll
            all regret it.  Sal and his two
            boys had nothing to do with what
            the police did.

            Let 'em be.

ANGLE--STREET

Mookie picks up a garbage can and dumps it out into the
street.  He walks through the crowd, up to Da Mayor, Sal,
Vito, and Pino.

CLOSE--MOOKIE

He screams.

                         MOOKIE
            HATE!!!!

SLOW MOTION

Mookie hurls the garbage can through the plate glass window
of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.  That's it.  All hell breaks loose.
The dam has been unplugged, broke.  The rage of a people has
been unleashed, a fury.  A lone garbage can thrown through
the air has released a tidal wave of frustration.

ANGLE--STREET

Da Mayor pushes Sal, Vito, and Pino out of the way as the
mob storms into Sal's Famous Pizzeria.

INT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--NIGHT

The people rush into Sal's Famous Pizzeria, tearing it up.

EXT: DA MAYOR'S STOOP--NIGHT

Da Mayor leads Sal, Vito, and Pino back to his stoop where
they watch in horror.

                         SAL
            There it goes.  Why?

                         DA MAYOR
            You was there.  First white folks
            they saw.  You was there.

Sal's Famous Pizzeria is going up in flames and now it's a
carnival.

                         MOTHER SISTER
            Burn it down.  Burn it down.

One might have thought that the elders--who through the
years have been broken down, whipped, their spirits crushed,
beaten into submission--would be docile, strictly onlookers.
That's not true except for Da Mayor.  The rest of the elders
are right up in it with the young people.

He's scared to death, as the mob is poised to tear his place

The wail of fire trucks and police sirens is now added to
the night.

EXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--NIGHT

The mob moves back to in front of Sal's as the fire trucks
and police, in full riot gear, pull up in the street behind
them.

The firemen rush to hook up their hoses, the police force

Pizzeria.

            Please disperse!  Please disperse!

The mob doesn't listen, they will not be moved.  The mob
will not be moved until they see Sal's Famous Pizzeria burn
to the ground.

ANGLE--SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA

The firemen douse the pizzeria, trying desperately to stop
the fire from spreading into the adjoining buildings.

WE SEE Mookie, Mother Sister, Sweet Dick Willie, ML, Coconut
Sid, Jade, Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella, etc., go down
before the powerful blast of the firehouse.

Now we've come full circle.  We're back to Montgomery or
Birmingham, Alabama.  The only thing missing is Sheriff Bull
Connor and the German shepherds.

It would take force to move them and that's exactly what the
mob got.  People are trying to hold on to each other, cars,
railings, anything to keep from being swept away.

EXT: DA MAYOR'S STOOP--NIGHT

Da Mayor, Sal, Vito, and Pino watch in disbelief.  It's
unbelievable what is happening before their eyes.

As WE MOVE IN TIGHTER ON the melted box, we begin to hear
the rap song that we've hear throughout.  All other sound
drops as the rap song gets louder and louder until it's
deafening.

FADE IN:

EXT: THE STREET--TO INT: RADIO STATION STOREFRONT--DAY

The CAMERA, FROM HIGH ABOVE, CRANES DOWN ON The Block.  The
sidewalk is deserted, broken glass is everywhere, and it
looks exactly as how one expects it to look, the morning
after an uprising.

The CAMERA NOW MOVES IN ON the WE LOVE storefront where
Mister Señor Love Daddy is in his familiar place behind the
mike.

            step off.  Get a life.

Mookie leaves.

MOTHER SISTER'S BEDROOM--DAY

Da Mayor wakes up in Mother Sister's big brass bed (she was
born in it).  At first he has no idea where he's at, then
sees Mother Sister sitting down across the room smiling at
him.

                         MOTHER SISTER
            Good morning.

                         DA MAYOR
            Is it a good morning?

                         MOTHER SISTER
            Yes indeed.  You almost got yourself
            killed last night.

                         DA MAYOR
            I've done that before.

Da Mayor gets up out of her big brass bed.

                         DA MAYOR
            Where did you sleep?

                         MOTHER SISTER
            I didn't.

                         DA MAYOR
            I hope the block is still standing.

                         MOTHER SISTER
            We're still standing.

Da Mayor and Mother Sister both look out the parlor window
to see THE BLOCK and Mookie.

EXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY

Mookie walks up to Sal's Famous Pizzeria as it still
smoulders in the morning light.  Sal emerges from the
wreckage; he looks like he might have slept there.

                                                           90.

Sal looks at Mookie in disbelief.

            Mookie, I always liked you.  Not
            the smartest kid, but you're honest.
            Don't make me dislike you.

                         MOOKIE
            Sal, I want my money.

                         SAL
            Don't even ask about your money.
            Your money wouldn't even pay for
            that window you smashed.

                         MOOKIE

Sal has had it.

            How much?  How much do I owe you?

                         MOOKIE
            My salary.  Two-fifty.

Sal pulls out a wad and quickly peels off hundred dollar
bills.

                         SAL
            One, two, three, four, five.

Sal throws the "C" notes at Mookie, they hit him in the
chest and fall to the sidewalk.

                         SAL
            Are you happy now?  That's five
            fucking hundred dollars.  You just
            got paid.  Mookie, you are a rich
            man, now ya life is set, you'll
            never have another worry, a care in
            the world.  Mookie, ya wealthy, a
            fuckin' Rockefeller.

Mookie is stunned by Sal's outburst.  He picks up the bills.

                         SAL
            Ya just got paid, so leave me the
            fuck alone.

                         MOOKIE
            You only pay me two-fifty a week.
                   (he throws two "C"
                   notes back at him)
            I owe you fifty bucks.

                         SAL
            Keep it.

                         MOOKIE
            You keep it.

                         SAL
            Christmas came early.

Both look at the two hundred-dollar bills on the sidewalk
and refuse to pick them up.  It's a stalemate.

                                                           92.


                         MOOKIE
            This is the hottest Christmas I've
            known.

Mookie counts his money.

                         SAL
            It's supposed to be even hotter
            today.

                         MOOKIE

            No.  What are you gonna do?

                         MOOKIE
            Make dat money.  Get paid.

                         SAL
            Yeah!...I'm goin' to the beach for
            the first day in fifteen years.
            Gonna take the day off and go to

                         SAL
            C'mere, Doctor.

Mookie turns around and goes back.

                         SAL
            Doctor, this is Sal talkin'.

                         MOOKIE
            OK.  OK.

                         SAL
            Doctor, always try to do the right
            thing.

                         MOOKIE
            That's it?

                                                           93.


                         SAL
            That's it.

Mookie thinks about it, looks at the two "C" notes still
smiling up at him.  He quickly scoops them up.

                         MOOKIE
            I got it.

EXT: STREET--DAY

HIGH ANGLE

As Mookie turns and walks away, Sal goes back into Sal's
Famous Pizzeria to salvage what is salvageable, and The
Block begins to awake from its slumber, ready to deal once
again with the heat of the hottest day of the year.

                                            FADE OUT.
