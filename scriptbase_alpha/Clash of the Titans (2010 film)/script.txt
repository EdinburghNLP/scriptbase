                         FADE IN:

          EXT. ALLEYWAY (VILLAGE) - DUSK

          Gloomy, last light. From out of the shadows comes            --
          A DOG. A dog of war. Big, mangy, muscular, scary. As
          he moves down the alley, the way becomes increasingly
          choked with fallen structures. and signs of tumult.

          EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DUSK

          TRACKING WITH THE DOG as he comes onto a battlefield.
          The hellish scene is REVEALED TO US SLOWLY --                

          SERIES OF SHOTS
          as the Dog traverses a landscape of --
          BODIES, frozen in contorted death poses. This was
          furious, hand-to-hand fighting between human SOLDIERS and
          nightmare CREATURES, their corpses now in piles to the
          horizon.
          The Dog climbs a mound of casualties. At the top, the
          Dog looks back across the battlefield. The Dog's eyes
          are sad, his expression weary and disgusted.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - NIGHT

          The entrance is patrolled by a dozen PALACE GUARDS. They     
          don't see the Dog pad silently to a fissure in the palace    
          wall and disappear inside.                                   

          INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - GREAT HALL - NIGHT             

          Bloodied and battered, the King's GENERALS are               
          disagreeing loudly about strategy. A loud BANGING sound
          pierces the hubbub, and the officers quiet, turning to --    
          KING ACRISIUS, a striking man in his prime, his handsome     
          face marked by one crooked scar on his jaw. He commands      
          the room --                                                  

                         KING ACRISIUS
          Now we end the debate about
          tactics... and begin to plan for
          victory.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

          AT THE BACK OF THE HALL
          The Dog stares at the King. Then slips away.

          INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - GREAT STAIRS - NIGHT

          Unseen by exhausted Guards, the Dog bounds up the stairs.     

          INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - ROYAL APARTMENT - CORRIDOR -


                         NIGHT
          The Dog approaches a doorway; stops to watch from the         
          shadows.

          INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - BEDCHAMBER - DOG'S POV -


                         NIGHT
          In the dim bedchamber, the SILHOUETTE of QUEEN DANAE as a     
          LADY-IN-WAITING removes her gown, revealing the Queen's       
          perfect body as she slips into bed. The Lady-in-Waiting
          leaves.
          The Dog's eyes. He moves forward.

                         FLOOR-LEVEL
          TRACKING WITH the Dog's legs as they MORPH INTO HUMAN
          LEGS. The CAMERA RISES BEHIND a towering male figure,
          who roughly pulls a curtain aside.                            
          In the bed, the Queen is startled, then pleased.

                         QUEEN DANAE
          My King! Has the strategy been
          set so quickly?

                         REVERSE ANGLE
          The looming figure looks exactly like King Acrisius,          
          including the distinctive scar. He regards her hungrily.      

                         QUEEN DANAE
          Come to your Queen, my King.

          INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - GREAT STAIRS - SUNRISE          

          The real King Acrisius wearily climbs the stairs with         
          AIDES and Guards. Suddenly, the King stops.                   

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         CONTINUED:
          On the wall above is the huge shadow of a four-legged
          creature -- and now it appears:
          The Dog stops at the top of the stairs and regards the
          men without fear -- its eyes blaze with a God's power.
          Even Acrisius, who fears nothing, steps back. The others
          raise their weapons.
          The Dog comes down the steps, eyes upon them, and passes     
          close by. No one dare move. The Dog disappears into the      
          shadows below.                                               

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. THE SEA - ROCKY PROMONTORY - CLOSE ON KING ACRISIUS'    


          HARDENED COUNTENANCE - DAY
          staring at --

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Queen Danae, PREGNANT NOW, and weeping. Her arms are
          bound.
          A ROYAL ENTOURAGE is gathered. The women weep, the men       
          agonize.                                                     
          Palace Guards lift the Queen into a chest and chain it       
          closed. On the King's signal, the Guards carry the chest     
          to the edge and drop it into the rough sea. We HEAR a
          SCREAM from within.
          Some members of the Royal Entourage look with scorn at
          their King, outraged by this double murder. Acrisius
          registers their disapproving looks and angrily turns to
          leave the promontory.
          WE SEE in his face what the others do not -- shame and
          doubt.                                                       
          IN THE WATER BELOW, the chest rights itself and rides out    
          on the tide.                                                 

          EXT. SAND DUNES OF A LONELY BEACH - NIGHT                    

          Two HORSEMEN gallop in the moonlight. The first Rider
          sways in the saddle and falls from his mount. He
          staggers to his feet, a skin of ale in his hands. It is
          King Acrisius, very drunk.
          The second Rider, the King's STEWARD, dismounts to give      
          aid, though he's also drunk.

                         CONTINUED:

                         KING ACRISIUS

                         (RAGING)
          My own subjects condemn me! They
          dare judge me? And what emboldens
          this treachery?...

                      STEWARD          
          You are mistaken, my King. None                                           
          would risk your anger --                                                  

                      KING ACRISIUS    
          (oblivious to him)                                                        
          It is Zeus who warps my                                                   
          kinadom!... Zeus the ungodly, Zeus                                        
          the defiler...                                                            
          This talk sobers the Steward instantly; he looks about                    
          fearlessly.                                                               

                      STEWARD          
          Please, speak not these things                           --               
          Acrisius spins on him, out of control --                  

                         KING ACRISIUS
          He cuckolds me in my castle, rapes
          my precious Queen! This is a low,
          conniving God... But I have bested
          him on this day and humbled the
          great Prime.

                         (SWIGS ALE)
          Tell me, Panos, who rivals Zeus on
          Olympos? Who does the Fearless
          One fear?

                         STEWARD                                                   
          I beg you, Your Highness --                               
          Acrisius pulls a dagger and holds it to the Steward's
          throat.

                         KING ACRISIUS
          Tell me what the Priests say!

                         STEWARD
          (terrified, halting)
          Tiamat... Tiamat, Queen of the
          Deep.

                         (WHISPERING)
          Those who dare, whisper she covets
          Zeus' throne and schemes to
          achieve it, the ambitious Goddess
          of the Dark Oceans...

                         CONTINUED:

                         KING ACRISIUS
          Yes, Tiamat! And today I have
          honored her.
          The King whirls and staggers up the crest of the dune.        

                         KING ACRISIUS
          I've taken Zeus' whore and the
          bastard she grows in her belly and
          thrown them to Tiamat in her rough
          sea!
          (toward the moonlit

                         OCEAN)
          I honor Zeus' rival with all that
          was dear to me --
          (falters, ashamed)
          -- and commit double murder in her
          honor...
          About to go to pieces, rage seizes him again --               

                         KING ACRISIUS
          so that Zeus will know I
          despise and disdain him and spit
          on his foul name!
          The Steward shrinks from this blasphemy, eyes darting in      
          fear.                                                         
          ON THE CREST the King is silhouetted in the moonlight,        
          arms raised defiantly toward the heavens, when suddenly --    
          -- his figure is seized by some violent force, shaking
          his being. A HORRIBLE SOUND                                  (MUSCLE TEARS, BONES CRACK)
          and THE KING'S BODY GROWS LARGER AS IT DISTORTS IN

          MISSHAPEN DISFIGUREMENT.
          And thus, KING ACRISIUS BECOMES... KALIBOS!
          The Steward SEES what we now cannot. An INHUMAN ROAR and
          the shadow of this new being falls upon the Steward. He
          SCREAMS, but it's too late -- the huge CREATURE grabs him
          by the neck and LIFTS HIM OUT OF FRAME. From the empty,
          moonlit dunes, we...

                         FADE IN:

          EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

          A LITTLE BOY leads a blind OLD MAN along a road.             
          Abruptly, the Old Man halts. Puzzled, the Boy scans
          ahead, SEES --
          -- a SPRAY OF DUST, moving fast, behind a blurred BLACK

                         FORM --                                                      
          -- in an instant, the apparition blows past them -- wind
          and dust whip at them. In awe and fear --

                         OLD MAN
          Thoth the Quick...
          (sensing the boy's

                         CONFUSION)
          Messenger of the Gods. Bound for
          Olympos.
          The rushing Black Form crosses a field, leaving a            
          violent wave in the long grass and suddenly --

          EXT. FIELDS/WOODS/MOUNTAIN/OLYMPOS - DAY

          WE ARE IN THAT RUSHING POV: the landscape is just a          
          blur. But up ahead is a mountain: OLYMPOS. WE ZOOM UP        
          TO the summit --                                             
          -- INTO the clouds above the peak. THROUGH the mist --
          villas, classical facades: THE ABODE OF THE GODS. The
          polished stone of the grandest villa reflects THOTH'S
          dark form touching down.

          INT. ATRIUM                                                 (OLYMPOS)   - DAY

          THOTH THE QUICK enters the wide courtyard, his cape
          billowing. He strides past the reflecting pool in the
          center of the courtyard, gravely acknowledging --
          -- each of the TEN FIGURES seated around the perimeter...
          THE OLYMPIANS. APOLLO is here, and bronze-helmeted
          ATHENA; APHRODITE and muscular VULCAN -- we are dazzled
          and lose count.
          Thoth bows deeply before the throne of ZEUS, majestic,       
          bearded, awe-inspiring. An EAGLE is perched on his arm.      

                         THOTH
          My lord.

                         ZEUS
          (rumbles, like

                         THUNDER)
          We have debated, we have voted,
          and it is decided. We offer the
          Humans peace. Thoth, you will
          take them the terms of a treaty --

          TIAMAT                                                     (O.S.)

                         (SCORNFULLY)
          A treaty!
          Zeus and his eagle turn their heads. The God's eyes are
          familiar -- the blazing orbs we saw in The Dog.
          In the shadowed corner of the atrium stand TWO MORE
          Olympians: SET THE VOID, whose countenance is death made    
          visible, and --                                             
          -- TIAMAT, QUEEN OF THE DEEP, the only God fearless         
          enough to challenge Zeus' rule --                           

                         TIAMAT
          We don't negotiate with them! We
          dictate to them. Their place is
          to beg. They have forgotten their
          role and have denied us the
          sustenance of their prayers.

                         APHRODITE
          Our mercy will give them reason to
          be grateful. They will bow down
          and whisper our names with more
          passion than before.

                         TIAMAT
          They will bow down when we snap
          their backs! Mercy? We are Gods!
          Some of us remember that and are
          not afraid --
          Zeus has had enough: furious ARCS OF LIGHTNING jump to
          the walls, the eagle beats its wings in rage.               

                         ZEUS
          Silence! Or learn what it is to
          be afraid! The debate is over,
          the votes cast...
          Zeus points to a golden tray; it bears TEN chips of
          alabaster versus TWO shards of obsidian.

          Joppan royal family.
          (turning again on

          And we do not interfere in their
          actions. We leave them
          undisturbed unless-invoked by name
          to enter their affairs.

                         SET
          And if they refuse our terms?

                         ZEUS
          They have suffered terrible
          losses. They will not pass up a
          chance for peace.

          INT. ATRIUM - MAGIC HOUR (LATER)

          Only Tiamat and Set now. Tiamat regards Zeus' throne.

          weaker than I knew.
          Set gestures at the white chips on the tray as he picks
          up the two black shards representing their votes. He
          hands one to Tiamat.                                       

                         SET
          So have they all. They no longer

          Set agrees, his eyes searching her face.                   

                         TIAMAT
          We will manage these thick-witted
          Humans to our own ends.
          (off his look)
          Yes, we will be bound by great
          Zeus' rules... until their fragile
          membranes tear. We dare not
          interfere with these insects...

          Tiamat flicks the obsidian into the reflecting pool --

          None like this.

          I'm not cowed. If these arrogant

          A truce would benefit all...

                         KEPHEUS
          In my palace, I decide how the                             
          discourse proceeds, not some
          messenger sent on errands by Zeus.

          THOTH (O.S.)
          You are correct, Your Highness, I
          do the bidding of Zeus...
          To their astonishment, the emissary is already in the
          Throne Room, behind them. Startled, they turn to see      --    
          Thoth the Quick, Messenger of the Gods, float forward.          

                         THOTH
          ... as do all Gods... and all men.
          Thoth removes his hood, revealing his crystal skull.       

                         THOTH
          (with an edge)
          King Kepheus, as humble messenger
          of Zeus, I've come to talk of
          peace.

                         AMOUN

                         (DEFERENTIAL)
          Thoth the Quick, I am Amoun, the
          King's Magi Strategos. We welcome                          
          you with humility, honored by your                         
          visit from the realm of the Gods.                          
          The King shoots Amoun a look, but he is still shaken by
          Thoth's sudden appearance. Cassiopeia tries to recover
          her composure.

                         KEPHEUS
          I am a reasonable man. Everyone
          wishes for the conflict to cease.                          

                         THOTH
          Zeus above all. He has so long
          desired the tragedy end, he made a

          the crowd watches the Basilica, worried by the God's        
          presence.

          INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY

          Kepheus and Cassiopeia sit stunned. Amoun watches
          without surprise.

                         KEPHEUS
          A treaty marriage?

                         THOTH
          You have a daughter of age.

                         (GASPS)
          Andromeda!

                         KEPHEUS
          Surely Zeus does not ask a mortal
          father to give his daughter to a
          God.

                         THOTH
          No. Such a union would be
          unclean. Years ago Zeus created a                           
          scion of mixed blood. Half-man,
          half-God. Bred for just this
          union. That is how important Zeus
          considers this truce.

          Zeus has given his son to the

                         KEPHEUS
          I have heard of no such demigod.

          Majesty, if I may -- the young man

          fishing village on the isle of                         
          Seriphos.
          Kepheus turns, surprised at Amoun's foreknowledge.

                         KEPHEUS
          You knew about this and said
          nothing?

          My Queen, I serve only the great
          order of things. I was the boy's
          tutor years ago.

                         KEPHEUS
          How haughty this boy must be, who                      
          knows he is half-God.

                         AMOUN
          He knows nothing and believes
          himself an ordinary man. He has
          never left his village. He can be                      
          overconfident, but it is from                          
          inexperience, not arrogance.                           
          Repheus and Cassiopeia exchange wary looks. Sharply

          With our daughter's future at

          Suddenly, the WALLS GROAN, compressing with an AWFUL
          SHUDDER. The room TILTS. Kepheus and the Queen grab for
          a solid handhold, frightened.
          The golden marbles on a tabletop roll from their pits and
          pile up in defiance of gravity. Wine goblets tilt toward
          Thoth.

          Of course... of course your word
          is unquestioned here.
          Thoth's demeanor changes. The marbles spill off the          
          table, rolling across the floor to Kepheus' feet. TILT       
          UP TO his intimidated face:

          EXT. UNDERWATER (THE AEGEAN SEA)                            - DAY                                              

          Perfectly blue, sunlight shafting from the surface.                                                            
          A GREAT WHITE SHARK appears, ensnared in a fisherman's       
          net. Panicked, the shark is diving as fast as it can.        
          As the net passes we see --
          ANTEROS, a hapless young fisherman, his legs entangled in    
          the net, desperately trying to hold his breath. When
          they have disappeared, we see a FIGURE appear through the
          blue in pursuit. As he passes, we get our first look

                         AT --
          PERSEUS,                                                    25, wiry, bronzed from the sun, a stubbled jaw,
          a knife in his teeth. He swims with the power and grace
          of a porpoise -- beyond the ability of any normal man.

          EXT. SEA FLOOR - DAY

          The shark thrashes about, jaws snapping close to Anteros.

                         CONTINUED:
          Perseus swims INTO VIEW and uses his knife to cut the net
          near the shark's snout. The shark tries to swim through
          the hole, but instead drags the net upwards. Perseus
          hangs on.
          One more slice and the shark zooms out of the net,
          bumping the young hero as it swims away. Perseus pulls
          Anteros toward the surface.

          EXT. FISHING TRAWLER - DAY

          A CREW of FISHERMEN wait desperately at the rail.
          SPYROS, the oldest and toughest, watches in agony.
          Perseus breaks the surface, gasping, his lifeless friend
          in his arms. Five crewmen dive in to help, but Perseus
          is mad with despair. They have to pull him away.
          Spyros watches sadly. But also, relieved to see the one
          survivor.

          EXT. FISHING TRAWLER - DAY

          Spyros makes his way to the bow, where Perseus sits
          alone, downcast, in pain. Spyros watches in silence.
          Then, gruffly --

                         SPYROS
          Your grieving does Anteros no
          good. It comforts only you.

                         PERSEUS
          It's my fault he's gone.

                         SPYROS
          He was careless with the net.
          Perseus gives him a hard look.

                         PERSEUS
          So it's his fault. Not mine, not
          fate, not the Gods?

                         SPYROS

                         (DISDAINFULLY)
          The Gods delude themselves about
          their power and watch in envy
          while we act. We make our own
          history.

          (breaks down, crying)
          Now my history is I let my friend
          die in my arms. I made it back,
          why couldn't he?

                         SPYROS
          What you do, no other man can do.
          Have you not noticed?

                         PERSEUS
          To what purpose? I failed him.

                         SPYROS

                         (SCOFFS)
          Purpose! Looking for purpose is
          what ensnares men in the
          superstition of the Gods, as
          surely as your friend was caught
          in that net. And all the
          searching leads down to the same
          place.
          The trawler is approaching its home island, Seriphos.
          Perseus looks off at the rocky coast. Collects himself,

                         QUIETLY --

                         PERSEUS
          You always say that my abilities
          are greater than other men's. But
          they were not enough to save him.

                         SPYROS
          You are still a man, confined by
          man's limits. You are just as
          likely to fail as succeed.

                         PERSEUS
          How is that greater than other
          men?

                         SPYROS
          Ordinary men fail most of the
          time.
          The trawler rounds a point on the island.
          Perseus spies a beautiful girl on the cliff. A closer

                         LOOK --
          A huntress; a pagan leather bandeau hugs her lithe         
          figure. Flowers in her golden hair -- wilted dahlias.      
          Young yet ancient. THE WILTING GIRL.

                         CONTINUED:
          She watches Perseus intently as the boat passes. He
          turns to see if Spyros or his friends have seen her, but
          no one has. When he looks back, she's gone.

           EXT. PROMONTORY NEAR THE HOME OF SPYROS - MAGIC HOUR     

           Perseus sits looking sadly at the sea that killed his
          friend. TEKLA,                                             14, Perseus' adoptive sister, runs up                    
           from the modest stone dwelling. She sees his mood and    
          touches his arm gently.                                 

                         TEKLA
          Mother wants you to come in for
          supper.
          (as he is

                         UNRESPONSIVE)
          Perseus, why are you so sad?
          This breaks his spell. He looks at Tekla warmly, gets up    
          and puts a reassuring arm around her shoulders as they      
          head inside.                                                

          INT. HOME OF SPYROS - KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Perseus eats with his adoptive family: Spyros, his wife
          MARMARA, and Tekla. Spyros is patient and twinkly with      
          his wife though he disagrees with her beliefs.

                         TEKLA
          I still don't understand.

                         SPYROS
          Your mother can explain. She
          believes everything has an
          explanation, even if we have to
          make it up.

          you, Marmara.

                         TEKLA
          Tell me! Why is there war between
          Man and the Gods?
          Marmara and Tekla continue to bring out the food.

                         MARMARA
          At the beginning of time, when Man
          was young, he prayed to the Gods.
          His belief in the Gods gave his
          life meaning. It was a good
          thing.

                         (IGNORING HIM)
          But Man grew, as children do, and
          he turned away from the Gods. Be
          began to put his faith in other
          things.
          Perseus watches the debate with fiery eyes.

                         TEKLA
          What things?

                         SPYROS
          Learning, science... love.

                         (PASSIONATE)
          self-determination! Those
          things that give Man dignity and
          independence.

                         MARMARA
          But what of the Gods, who had
          protected and guided us so long?
          They must breathe our prayers to
          survive. They hunger for

                         (TO TEKLA)
          Your father's mind is closed on
          these matters.

                         SPYROS
          The Gods were desperate to claim
          our awe again.

                         TEKLA
          Desperate... the Gods?

                         SPYROS
          Yes, even the Gods. If they could
          not earn our faith with love, they
          would demand it with fear.

          Middle of the night. Perseus lies wide awake in his tiny    
          space. He stares, thinking about his friend. Suddenly,      
          a KNOCK at the door.                                        

          INT. HOME OF SPYROS - DOORWAY - NIGHT

          Perseus opens the door to the Wilting Girl. Her beauty      
          electrifies him. She glows from within, but her color is    
          oddly faded, washed-out.                                    

                         PERSEUS
          You... I saw you watching our boat
          at the cliff.

                         WILTING GIRL
          It was not the boat I was
          watching.

                         PERSEUS
          Can I be of service?

                         WILTING GIRL
          Yes, of service. I need you to
          come with me on a journey.
          Perseus gives her a look.

                         PERSEUS
          Right now?
          (as she nods)
          It wouldn't take much persuading
          to get me to leave this village,
          but tonight is impossible. My
          family can't wake and find me
          gone. Where do you want me to go?

                         WILTING GIRL
          It's not what I want. I am in the

          Come back in the morning and we

          I'm sorry.

                         PERSEUS
          For what?
          Perseus doesn't notice the black widow spider scurry
          between her feet. Then a centipede, a scorpion. Then a
          swarm, racing toward him.
          He feels the first spider and looks down. The creatures
          climb his legs, biting. Weakening from the venom, he
          stumbles back into the table, loses his balance and
          falls.

          A white sail, swollen with wind, draws the small boat
          swiftly across the sea. The Wilting Girl, alone, sits
          quietly at the stern, effortlessly steering.

                         CLOSER
          We SEE that she is also watching Perseus, who is sleeping
          in a makeshift bed in the bottom of the boat. Her eyes
          slowly travel over his bronzed, muscled frame. There are

          This time? Only a few hours. The

          I had a dream. I fell into a dark
          pit. I thought I would never stop

          formed a soft net, caught me and
          tossed me back.

          When I came back up to the world,
          a beautiful woman appeared and
          spoke to me. But as she spoke she
          would sometimes disappear into the

           place.                

                        WILTING GIRL          
           It is the war you have the power                                                  
           to end.               
           He throws her an angry look, grim.                                                

                        PERSEUS               
           Don't joke about such things. I'd                                                 
           be useless before such a huge                                                     
           responsibility.

           Perhaps you would be...

          They pass an evangelist                        (FANTASOS) haranguing a crowd.

                         FANTASOS

                         (MID-SPEECH)
          -- one true God is not Zeus but
          she called the Deep -- Tiamat!
          (quoting from his

                         GOSPEL)
          'Before the first dawn, the eyes
          of the Deep watched the earth.'
          (to the crowd)
          Bow down to the Goddess of Chaos
          or know despair, for Tiamat will
          rule the heavens and the earth.
          Perseus is mystified by this talk. He turns to Vidalia
          for explanation, but she seems disturbed by the preacher   L
          and does not return Perseus' gaze.

          Perseus and Vidalia round a corner and see the regal
          Basilica. WORKMEN hang banners and decorations,
          preparing for a big event.

                         PERSEUS
          What are they celebrating?

          INT. BASILICA - ROYAL PARLOR -.DAY

          Cassiopeia hurries down a corridor to the parlor. WE
          FOLLOW to find:
          Kepheus speaking sternly to Perseus, before him.

                         KEPHEUS
          . before I am a king or a
          peacemaker, I am a father. Do you
          know what that means?

                         PERSEUS
          I'm not sure, Your Highness. I
          did not know my father.

                         KEPHEUS

                         (THROWN)
          Yes, well... it means I had no
          desire for my little girl's
          carefree springtime to be cut

                         SHORT --
          (to Cassiopeia,

                         IRRITABLY)
          What is she?

                         CASSIOPEIA

                         (EMBARRASSED)
          I'm sure she's preparing herself
          to make the best possible
          impression.
          Perseus suppresses a smile, amused by the royal couple.
          Kepheus paces with mounting impatience.

          -- and all so she could be thrust
          into a momentous conflict... of
          which she knows nothing at all.

          She's not the only one, sir. I
          don't know much about the events
          for which I've been drafted.

                         KEPHEUS
          (disarmed, but tough

                         GUY)
          I take no comfort in that, young
          man. In fact, I find little to
          take comfort in here. You are a
          stranger from a distant place, and
          I am asked to entrust the welfare
          of my daughter to you.

                         (LEANING INTO

                         PERSEUS)
          If you are not kind and patient
          with her, if any harm of any kind
          should come her way, I will have
          your head on a stake.
          Kepheus thinks he sees a smirk on Perseus' face. He puts    
          his hand on the hilt of his sword.

                         KEPHEUS
          Is this amusing to you?

                         PERSEUS
          Not even a little, my lord. It's
          just that I myself was waylaid --
          snatched also, as you say, from my
          happy springtime...
          Kepheus studies him to see if he's making jest of him.

                         PERSEUS
          I've been told I'm to play a                                
          part in events which serve a                                
          higher purpose... of which I'm not                          
          at all convinced.

                         KEPHEUS
          Does a truce in the war between
          Men and Gods not strike you as a
          higher purpose?

                         PERSEUS
          With all respect, I have never                              
          seen a God. On my island, they're                           
          no more than a story.

                         

                         KEPHEUS
          You will learn there is more to                             
          this universe than is found on

          have experienced, not on a faith I
          do not possess.

          Where does a young person get such
          ideas?

                         PERSEUS
          Perhaps from my adopted father,
          sir. I admire him greatly, and he
          believes in little he cannot hold
          in his hand.

          The Wilting Girl slips into the dusk like a thief.          

          EXT. ALLEYWAY - MAGIC HOUR

          The Wilting Girl steals down the dark, narrow alley,        
          headed toward the outskirts of town.
          Suddenly, a heavy wall shoots up from the cobblestones,     
          blocking her way. She startles, but does not stop. She
          goes up to the wall, turns at an angle and slides right
          through the stone, like a ghost.
          On the other side, she emerges from the stone, breathing    
          hard. She looks around and hurries down an intersecting
          passageway.
          She's gone only a few steps, when just ahead of her,        
          thick vines shoot out and form a dense barrier. She
          takes a breath and dives into the surging growth.
          She almost makes it through, but at the last moment,        
          vines wrap her arms and legs, holding her prisoner. She
          gives up, with a sigh. We HEAR the LAUGHTER of a God.

                         WILTING GIRL
          Zeus?
          Zeus' rumbling voice is held low, talking to her in an
          intimate way -- a beautiful sound.

          It's too painful. I can't involve

          ZEUS                                                        (V.O.)
          You you already involved. Such is                                     
          fate. We cannot hide from the
          .trials of our future... no matter
          how dark the alleyway.
          She looks back at the Basilica with profound sadness.

          EXT. STREETS OF JOPPA - MAGIC HOUR

          Perseus roams, taking in the city with interest. Rich        
          and poor mix in the crowded streets. As always, the poor     
          have suffered the most from the conflict.                    

          EXT. OCEAN TERRACE - MAGIC HOUR

          Perseus follows the MUSIC and the sound of LAUGHTER to a
          crowded terrace overlooking the sea. Upper class YOUNG
          PEOPLE are partying en masse.
          Perseus moves through the revelry, looking at every girl,    
          testing his instincts. Suddenly, he stops in his tracks,     
          looking off --                                               

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         CONTINUED:
          Andromeda is dancing at the center of attention, her
          sheer gown enhancing her sensuality. The MUSIC ends.
          Andromeda laughs and tosses her curly mane.
          A HANDSOME YOUNG NOBLEMAN embraces her. She gives him a
          deep kiss, causing a sensation, then breaks away into the
          crush.

          EXT. BALUSTRADE - MAGIC HOUR

          Andromeda glides to the balustrade to watch the sunset.
          The Young Nobleman approaches, but her imperious gesture
          stops him cold.

          PERSEUS                                                     (O.S.)
          Very beautiful.
          Andromeda spins, petulant.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Will you please give me some

                         PEACE --
          The sight of the handsome stranger gives her pause.

                         ANDROMEDA
          What did you say?

                         PERSEUS
          I said, 'Very beautiful.'

                         ANDROMEDA                                                    
          Do you think just anyone can make                            
          intimate judgements on the royal
          family?

                         PERSEUS                                                      
          I meant the sunset.
          She regards Perseus over her glistening bare shoulder.       

                         ANDROMEDA
          Do you always start a seduction
          with an insult?
          Perseus moves to the rail, very close to her, and looks
          at the sea.

                         PERSEUS
          I know nothing of seduction. I'm
          a simple fisherman. My home is
          across that water.

                         ANDROMEDA
          What brings you here?

                         PERSEUS
          To Joppa? I was kidnapped.

                          

                         ANDROMEDA
          I mean here, tonight.
          He looks over at her a long moment.

                         PERSEUS
          I've come to see my future wife.
          Startled, Andromeda suddenly realizes who he is. A mad
          mix of emotions crosses her face.

          EXT. GARDENS OF THE BASILICA - NIGHT

          Perseus and Andromeda walk in moonlit gardens. She stays
          close, attracted to him.

                         ANDROMEDA
          It's not personal. You're not a
          bad-looking boy.
          (as Perseus laughs)
          I'm too young. I don't want to be
          married.

                         PERSEUS
          Me either.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Then why are you doing it?

                         PERSEUS
          No one asked me. And now that
          I've met you, I don't know if I
          can go through with it.
          (off her look)                                              
          It's not personal. Seeing you
          makes it real. I think a man
          should make his own decisions. I
          won't be the pawn of a King or a                            
          God.
          She looks at him with new interest.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Since we agree, it's settled. No                            
          marriage.

                         PERSEUS
          I don't think it's going to be
          that simple.
          Ignoring that, she takes his arm, moving even closer.

                         ANDROMEDA
          That doesn't mean we can't be
          friends. Get to know each other.
          I want to show you something.
          She leads him into a tall, hedged garden maze.

          EXT. THE BASILICA - GARDEN MAZE - NIGHT

          Beautiful in the moonlight. She hurries him quickly         
          around one turn, then another, and another. He laughs at
          her excitement.

                         PERSEUS
          I'm already lost.                                           

                         ANDROMEDA
          I'll take care of you.
          They take two more jogs and find themselves in an odd
          sylvan chamber. Soft plants have been stacked in what
          could be mistaken for a bed.

                         ANDROMEDA
          This is my special place. No one
          can see or hear or even find us
          now.

                         PERSEUS
          (looks around the

                         CHAMBER)
          I don't suppose I could escape
          without your aid.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Do you want to?
          When he turns back to her, she melts into his arms and
          gives him a long deep kiss. He's surprised, but handles
          it well. When she tries to continue, he slows things
          down, holding her at bay.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Do you not find me attractive?

                         PERSEUS
          One of the most beautiful women
          I've ever seen.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Of course, you haven't been much
          in the world.

                         PERSEUS
          True. Maybe a lot of girls look
          like you.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Don't you want to make love to
          your almost-wife? Maybe we'll
          find we're not compatible.

                         PERSEUS
          What if we find we're very compat--
          She stops him with another kiss. He starts to surrender
          to his desire, but again, he stops. Her voice is a low

                         PURR --

                         ANDROMEDA
          Is it true you're a demigod?

                         PERSEUS
          (makes a face)
          It seems what everyone wants to
          believe.
          Her face is inches from his. She looks into his eyes.

                         SEXY --

                         ANDROMEDA
          I don't see it.
          (as Perseus laughs)
          But let's find out for sure...
          She kisses him yet again, pulling him toward the bed of    
          foliage. He can no longer resist. Together they fall
          into the softness. He kisses her passionately as their
          bodies begin to move together. She breaks the kiss for
          only a moment, her voice husky --

                         ANDROMEDA
          I think I'm becoming a believer...
          They start to make love.

          The chamber, deserted for 25 years, is in decay, dead

          still he dwells in rancid
          hate, having killed his generals
          and sucked their bones. We cannot
          break the rules of Zeus and

          Perseus wakes on the bed of foliage, looks around.
          Andromeda is gone. He thinks, smiles. Then he remembers
          his situation. The smile fades.

          INT. THE BASILICA - GREAT HALL - EVENING

          Perseus, in a white tunic and polished ceremonial armor,
          moves through the crowd of REVELERS. The grandiose room
          is hemmed by columns and statues. The royal family sits
          on the dais. Andromeda motions Perseus up beside her.

          You're late.

                         PERSEUS

          I want to thank you for seeing me

          I won't be long-winded. You all
          know I am a modest person, no
          matter my rank.
          Some of the crowd react silently. Andromeda watches her
          mother with trepidation, but not as much as Kepheus,
          watching from his throne.

          Entourage.                                                  

                         CASSIOPEIA
          This union represents new hope for
          a lasting peace! That is the only
          cause for celebration.
          The crowd reacts with exclamations and applause. Amoun      
          wills her to stop. Cassiopeia takes another drink, looks    
          over at the Princess.

                         (MOIST-EYED)
          My sweet Andromeda... grown into a                        
          fine young woman, confident and
          sure. Look at her! Isn't she                              
          beautiful?
          Her subjects agree loudly. Andromeda wishes this would    
          end. Cassiopeia raises her glass.

                         CASSIOPEIA
          To my beautiful daughter... more
          beautiful than all the women of
          Joppa. More beautiful than the
          Gardens of Nineveh...
          Kepheus is about to pull her away. She throws him a
          spiteful glance.

                         CASSIOPEIA
          More beautiful than the turquoise
          ocean and its sublime Goddess of
          the Deep... Tiamat herself! My                            
          daughter is a beauty even a                               
          Goddess must envy.
          Amoun reacts in dismay. A distressed MURMUR roils the
          crowd. Andromeda goes to her mother.                      

                         CASSIOPEIA
          I've gone on too long --
          She stops with a look of sudden dread. The Great Hall     
          DARKENS. The torch flames TURN BLACK. The temperature     
          drops. The statues lining the hall shut their eyes and    
          the doors burst open.                                     
          TIAMAT, QUEEN OF THE DEEP, floats forward, parting the
          terrified celebrants. Perseus sees his first Olympian.
          Tiamat arrives at the dais. Cassiopeia drops to her
          knees.

                         TIAMAT
          You have blasphemed powers beyond
          understanding... You, a stupid
          braying goat before the
          unfathomable galaxies. You dare
          put this frivolous, scrawny
          slut...

          Tiamat tears off her cloak and STANDS NAKED. Her body,
          made from the elements of the sea, is magnificent -- sexy
          and terrifying.
          Fantasos, the priest who proselytizes for Tiamat in the      
          streets, is in the throng. His reaction is a mix of          
          religious ecstasy and outright lust.                         
          The celebrants shield their eyes, but Cassiopeia can't.
          She crumples, aging before our eyes. Every word shakes
          her frame --

                         TIAMAT
          Look upon the sublime and know
          your error. You'll not blink.
          Tell me now, mortal, how bright
          your preening urchin shines?
          No one dare look long at the Goddess. No one but             
          Perseus. Tiamat notices Perseus... and his boldness.         

                         TIAMAT
          People of Joppa, hear me. For the
          sacrilege of this arrogant
          creature, I will loose Leviathan
          upon you.
          The people react in terror. Cassiopeia starts to faint,           
          but Tiamat snaps her back to consciousness                  --    

                         TIAMAT
          I'm not finished. Hold your gaze.
          (to the people)
          For thirty days, Joppa shall
          suffer the scorn of Leviathan.
          And on the final day, you will be
          wiped from the earth.

          . sickly, aged Queen.
          Clouds of black sea ink swirl and swallow Tiamat, then
          implode. Tiamat is gone. Cassiopeia, palsied and
          withered, collapses. Kepheus and Royal Aides rush to
          her.

          EXT. OCEAN FLOOR - NIGHT

          An immense school of fish is SUDDENLY SPOOKED. An EERIE
          GLOW swells in the gloom -- Tiamat glides TOWARD us,        
          stops and raises her palm. The silt SWIRLS and RIPPLES.
          A VAST PRIMORDIAL SHAPE SLOWLY RISES in clouds of ocean     
          mud. It's impossible to see what this creature looks        
          like, but it is big. We hear a deafening ROAR, which        
          drives a SHOCKWAVE across the silt.                         

          EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - NIGHT

          The sea bulges and a TSUNAMI rolls toward the shores of     
          Joppa.

          EXT. JOPPA'S LOWER WHARF - NIGHT                            

          Dark docks and shanties under the cliffs, populace
          asleep.
          A lone FISHERMAN unloads nets from his boat. Suddenly,      
          the water under his boat is sucked out to sea. A deep       
          RUMBLE shakes the ground.                                   
          The fisherman is mesmerized as the horizon CLIMBS higher    
          and higher, a WALL OF WATER. In seconds, the colossal       
          wave breaks and falls, obliterating the boat, the docks     
          and the low-lying shanties.                                 

          INT. ROYAL CHAMBERS - NIGHT

          Cassiopeia lies blank and wan. A LOW DRONE grows.           
          Kepheus rushes to the window. And then, a deep, EARTH-      
          SHATTERING BELLOW from the creature. The room SHUDDERS.     

                         KEPHEUS
          Leviathan awakes...

          INT. BASILICA - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

          A figure passes by a window in silhouette -- Andromeda
          steals through the shadows toward the Throne Room.

          INT. BALCONY ABOVE THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

          Andromeda edges into position to see the room below.

          AMOUN (O.S.)
          . Leviathan -- First dweller of
          the deep. Hewn by Tiamat from the
          dark blood of the earth...

                         HER POV
          A council of VICEROYS and MINISTERS gathered before
          Kepheus, who seems lost in thought, head down. Perseus    
          stands off to the side.

          INT. THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

          Amoun reads from a scroll.                                

                         AMOUN
          . All monsters of the sea are

          Kraken -- colossal, rapacious, and                        
          nigh indestructible.
          The men turn to Kepheus; when he raises his face, he      
          looks exhausted.                                          

                         KEPHEUS
          My Queen lies near death. Am I                            
          now to choose between the survival
          of our state... and the life of                           
          Andromeda, my only child?                                 
          Amoun watches Perseus, at the fringe of the group,
          expectantly. But Perseus looks only perplexed, an
          observer.

          MINISTER OF DEFENSE

          The ministers are puzzled by Amoun's persistence.         
          Perseus, uncertainly --

          not seen much of the world, but it
          seems to me that nothing is

          The Ministers react to the young man's arrogance.

          He will help him now.                                     

                         KEPHEUS
          Help him with what?

                         SPYROS
          With whatever is needed...
          Perseus approaches the King. Surprising himself --        

                         PERSEUS
          He will help me destroy Leviathan.
          Spyros does a double-take, then swallows: "Yeah, okay,
          sure."

          UP ON THE BALCONY
          Andromeda reacts, falling in love with Perseus.       

          IN THE THRONE ROOM

                         KEPHEUS
          But how?
          Perseus has no idea.                                  

                         AMOUN
          Majesty, we can seek the counsel
          of the Norn Sisters of Skolothia.
          They know the hidden ways of the                      
          Gods. If Leviathan can be slain,
          they'll know how to do it.

                         PERSEUS
          We have thirty days to find its
          weakness.

          Twenty-nine.

                         PERSEUS
          (flashes him a look)
          We'll leave tonight.

                         KEPHEUS
          With what army? I dare not weaken                     
          our forces when the city is about                     
          to be besieged.

                         PERSEUS

          We'll go alone.

          Yes. Give us a map.                                   
          Amoun laughs. When some of the others join in, the   King
          gives them a look that stops them dead.

                         AMOUN
          My King, with your permission...
          The King assents, seemingly lost. Amoun speaks to
          Perseus.

          I'll go with you and bring a small
          band of comrades to help you on                              
          your mission. We can leave at
          first light.
          (to his Aide)
          Diokles, the map.
          The men move to the work area, where the Aide selects a      
          map from dozens. Something catches Perseus' eye.             

                         PERSEUS' POV
          Andromeda, up in the balcony, has made herself visible
          only to him. She silently mouths these words --              
          "Thank... you."

          AT THE MAP
          which has been hung for all to see, Amoun uses a pointer.

                         AMOUN
          We head north on the Via Dahlia.                             
          If we can make it to the Disputed

          . we'll join the Cleon desert                                
          legion, the most formidable unit
          in all the army... With their
          escort, we can safely reach our
          destination in Skolothia, which
          lies to the east...
          We DISSOLVE THROUGH the map and pointer, which remain
          LIGHTLY SUPERIMPOSED over the following:

          EXT. VIA DAHLIA - DAY

          MUSIC SWELLS as we see THE FULL EXPEDITION on horseback,     
          on the main road north. As they come over a rise, Amoun      

                         IDENTIFIES THEM:                                             
          First, two fearsome Mongols, MONGKE and TAMBURLANE.

          AMOUN (V.0.)
          Our guides will be Mongke and
          Tamburlane, father and son monster
          hunters from the Kingdom of the
          Iron Horde.
          Next, THE PRAETORIAN GUARD, commanded by a square-jawed    
          old soldier, DRACO. His men, in heavy armor: KOSMO,        
          Draco's lieutenant, and the soldiers ABAS, ICOS, THAD,     
          BOREAS, KRIKOR, and POLLUC.

          Our escort will be a detachment of                         
          the Praetorian Guard, led by

          security force in Joppa.                                   
          Next, on a stunning pale horse, a pale rider -- the        
          Wilting Girl.

          PERSEUS                                                   (V.0.)
          Why do we bring the Earth Goddess                          
          into this danger?                                          

          AMOUN (V.0.)
          I thank the stars we have her.                             
          Besides, she takes her orders from
          an authority much greater than I.
          Next, Spyros; horseback riding is not one of his many      
          skills. Behind him, Perseus and Amoun ride talking --      

                         PERSEUS
          Amoun, it seems an odd coincidence
          you came into my life as tutor, so
          long ago, and now, once again you
          instruct me.

                         AMOUN

                         (LAUGHS)
          No matter what you believe,
          Porpoise, some things are fated.
          I've been looking forward to this
          journey for a long, long time.
          He spurs his horse, riding ahead. Spyros drops back
          beside Perseus.

                         SPYROS
          Who would have thought we'd be on
          a journey like this? Two simple
          fishermen.

          I'm afraid I've dragged you into
          real danger, Father, when I have
          little idea of what I'm doing.

                         SPYROS
          Living at the mercy of the sea so
          long has convinced me some
          adventures are unexpected and some
          dangers unavoidable. It's all in
          your attitude.

                         PERSEUS
          What's our attitude about                                   
          destroying Leviathan?

                       SPYROS
          The Kraken is just another big                              
          fish.

          Tiamat's Palace-Galleon is bigger than anything man can
          construct. Tiamat is at the prow of the vessel, using
          all her godly power to STIR THE ELEMENTS. With great
          effort, she sends a hurricane down on Joppa.
          Set the Void approaches the prow.

          Tiamat's storm is pounding Joppa. LIGHTNING stabs          
          through the dark clouds. RAIN POUNDS the tiles outside
          Andromeda's lavish bedroom.
          Peshet glides to Andromeda, who's wide awake, red-eyed,    
          distressed.

          A CRACK OF THUNDER. Andromeda looks over at her,

          Peshet? He was right.
          Peshet's feline eyes widen. More LIGHTNING.

          EXT. THE VIA DAHLIA - NIGHT

          The sound of that same DISTANT THUNDER as the Expedition

          FLASHES over faraway Joppa.

          Perseus and the Wilting Girl ride side by side. Perseus                 
          looks back at the distant storm.

          The moonlight illuminates a crumbling, limestone arch on
          which time-worn letters read: "VIA DAHLIA."

          By what name may mortals call you?

          I have to call you something...

                         (THINKING)
          Since we're naming you on this
          road, what about 'Via Dahlia'?
          She gives him a sharp look. Is he mocking her? He's
          defensive.

                         PERSEUS
          That's a pretty name. Wait,
          better yet -- 'Vidalia'? How's
          that... 'Vidalia'? That's more
          than pretty, beautiful really,
          just as you are.
          She is pleased, self-conscious, concentrating on the road
          ahead.

                         PERSEUS
          You don't like it?

          I do not object.
          She picks up the pace, moving her horse a little ahead.
          He smiles.

          EXT. FOREST CLEARING (VIA DAHLIA) - NIGHT

          They've camped for the night in a clearing. A fire                     
          burns, food cooks.                                                     
          Mongke and Tamburlane emerge from the woods with armfuls
          of timber and kindling. Draco glances up from striking                 
          his flintstone. Gruffly --

          The Mongols stare -- either not comprehending or ready to

          He climbs mossy steps.

          EXT. ABANDONED BATH (THERMAE) - NIGHT    

          The ruins of a public bath, its marble pool fed by a                
          stream.                                                             
          Perseus sees Vidalia on the far side, her back turned.              
          Perseus freezes as she drops her garment. He peers                  
          through the vines.

          The leaves offer tantalizing cover to her naked body.               
          She dives in with a quiet SPLASH.

          Vidalia surfaces and drifts on her back, looking sadly       
          into the sky.
          Perseus fixates on the sadness in her eyes. His
          expression changes, and the tenor of this stolen vigil is
          altered.
          RAINDROPS fall as the SKY OPENS and a CLOUDBURST pelts
          the pool. Vidalia opens her lips to taste the rain and
          smiles. LIGHTNING.

           Abas uses his sword to HACK at dried wood. He bends to      
           pick up a branch when he HEARS the CRACK of wood. He        
           whirls, sword at ready. But there is nothing there.         
           Embarrassed, he picks up the firewood. Now he HEARS
           something unidentifiable -- is that BREATHING? Spooked,
           he turns to head back to camp --
           A DARK FIGURE is standing behind him, larger than a man,    
           grotesquely misshapen. Abas raises his sword, but a         
           twisted PAW swats it away with a ROAR. Abas tries to        
           raise the sword again and realizes his arm is gone. He

           features and a leathery, scaled hide -- HUMBABA.            
          Suddenly, Set the Void appears. The evil God strokes the    
          sleeping monster's head, then reaches inside Humbaba's      
          skull. The animal goes stiff; its leg twitches.

          Hear me, my pet. Let my

          Perseus. How long do you think

          Icos and Boreas exchange a sly look.        

                         BOREAS
          Don't goad the boy, Icos. No Man

                         ICOS
          Did not Bellerophon tame the Great
          White Pegasus?

          You're right. But he was a

          Stop it, rogues. One of our own
          has disappeared without a trace
          and all you can think is to cause

          Don't worry, Commander, the boy
          won't even get on its back.
          With a "watch this" grin, Perseus rises. Draco pulls him     
          back down.

          trouble and keep our goal in

          Perseus jumps up and approaches a roan Pegasus, speaking     
          soothingly. It WHINNIES and threshes its wings,              
          buffeting Perseus with gusts.
          The Pegasus rears up, and leaps over Perseus' head. It       
          lands behind him, bucks its hind legs, and kicks Perseus     
          face-first into the dirt.
          Icos and Boreas are laughing, but when Draco gives them a
          dark look, Boreas jumps up, sobered, and heads into the
          clearing.

                         BOREAS
          I'll collect him right now,
          Commander.
          Suddenly, Humbaba erupts from the thicket with a HOWL.       
          The Pegassi take flight, but the Humbaba grabs one and       
          swallows it whole. Humbaba turns and SNIFFS the air,         
          homing in on Perseus.

          Icos bolts. Draco and Boreas leap into the clearing with     
          swords drawn to draw the monster's attention. Perseus        
          does the same.

          Perseus CRIES OUT and leaps at the creature, sword

          Vidalia spins her shepherd's sling to pitch lead sling-
          bullets. Spyros leaps between Perseus and the monster
          and thrusts his weapon -- a VICIOUS-LOOKING HARPOON/BOAT

          HOOK.
          Tamburlane hoists an ancient BAZOOKA. Mongke lights the     
          fuse and backs away. KA-BOOM! The weapon belches fire       
          and metal.                                                  
          The Humbaba staggers from the shot, but lunges and          
          swallows Mongke whole. Spyros sinks his harpoon in one      
          leg, but has it ripped from his hands.

          A delusion is planted in its mind.

          CAWING RAVENS descends from the sky and dives straight       
          into the monster's mouth. As the Humbaba tries to shake      
          them away, Mongke is thrown clear.                           

                         VIDALIA

                         (TO DRACO)
          Now! The belly! Slash the belly!
          Draco moves to do that when Perseus leaps forward, lunges
          and sweeps his blade up Humbaba's belly at the same
          moment Draco sweeps down. The two blades barely miss
          each other, opening a huge X in the belly. The others
          are shocked and impressed by Perseus. Steaming purple
          entrails spill over Perseus and Draco. HUMBABA CRASHES

          TO THE GROUND.
          The flock of ravens, liberated from Humbaba's gut, shake
          the viscera from their feathers and take flight.

          EXT. THE CEDAR FOREST - STREAM - DAY

          Perseus, somber, washes the creature's guts from his arms
          and legs. He turns to find Vidalia standing above him,
          furious.

          I should cast a spell upon you and
          leave you forever a stone upon
          this stream.

                         PERSEUS
          I didn't beckon the Humbaba.

                         VIDALIA
          You did, with your childish
          recklessness, and Boreas has paid
          the price!
          Perseus, already rife with guilt, is stung by the truth.     

                         VIDALIA                                                      
          Your safety is entrusted to me by                            
          the mightiest power on Olympos.

          The monster killed my friend. I
          could not contain my rage. But
          you, Goddess, are aloof from the
          emotions of Men.
          Vidalia's eyes narrow, enraged.

          Yes, a tyrannical Goddess, who
          dares question your mad rush to
          annihilation.

                         (QUIETLY INTENSE)

          you cannot act upon every impulse.
          She whirls and walks away. Perseus is left with the
          weight of his culpability... and the beginning of
          knowledge.

          INT. SECRET SANCTUARY OF TIAMAT (JOPPA)   - NIGHT

          A CADRE of REVOLUTIONARIES led by Fantasos is gathered.
          Agenor, the handsome scullion who made love to Andromeda,
          leads Peshet in from the rain. She is frightened; Agenor
          has misled her.

                         PESHET
          Where have you brought me?

          It's okay...

                         AGENOR
          Just listen to this good man. He
          needs your help.
          Fantasos comes forward. He fixes her with a hypnotic

          you, their leader.                                            

          EXT. CLEON LEGION BIVOUAC - PREDAWN

          Several Soldiers have been drawn from camp by the
          IRRESISTIBLE FRAGRANCE of the Lotus flowers. They pluck
          petals and chew them.
          The rest of the Legion filters out between the tents to
          take their fill of the drug.
          Kalibos watches the handsome, powerful warriors from
          across the field of Lotus blossoms.

          INT. THE BASILICA - ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

          Peshet comes into the dark room and looks at the lump on
          Andromeda's bed. On instinct, she hurries to the bed and
          throws off the covers -- a pile of cushions, no
          Andromeda. Peshet races out.

          EXT. THE ACROPOLIS - NIGHT                                   

          Peshet sprints through the RAIN, dodging the REFUGEES and    
          CITIZENS like a cat, peering under each hood, searching      
          for her mistress.                                            

          EXT. THE ACROPOLIS - COVERED PLAZA - NIGHT                   

          On the plaza, a rabid throng of Refugees. Fantasos, the      
          Revolutionary leader, exhorts the mob, surrounded by         
          BODYGUARDS, including Agenor. As before, Fantasos seems      
          to have actual hypnotic powers.                              

                         FANTASOS
          How much are we meant to suffer?
          Where is your mighty King? Safely
          cloistered above the flood... on
          the high ground, with the high-
          born -- the privileged gentry!...
          The angry crowd responds, fists shaking. Peshet moves
          through the throng, desperately looking for Andromeda.
          She passes close to the rostrum and Fantasos registers
          her presence.

                         FANTASOS
          . Does Kepheus worry about you?
          No! Only the Princessa... And
          still, the Kraken comes! Does the
          King build his defenses at the
          water's edge?
          "NO!" cries the crowd. Peshet is shocked to find herself
          replying with them -- "NO1" Fantasos motions for Agenor
          to continue the harangue, while Fantasos hurries off the
          stage.

                         AGENOR
          No! He makes his stand at his
          daughter's chamber door!... We
          will show Kepheus we're not
          sacrificial fodder. We will
          tremble the walls of his Basilica!
          RABID SUPPORT from the mob. Peshet stops suddenly,
          peering ahead.

          at the fringe of the crowd, Andromeda herself watches        
          from the anonymity of a hooded cloak, terrified.

          Andromeda is the one Tiamat wants!
          We die so she may live...
          As the crowd EXPLODES, Andromeda hurries away in tears.    
          Peshet fights through the crush to follow her.             

          EXT. THE ACROPOLIS - ALLEY.- NIGHT                         

          Peshet rounds a corner, frustrated. Andromeda is gone.     
          A hand grabs Peshet's shoulder, startling her. It is       
          Fantasos.                                                  

                         FANTASOS                                                   
          Peshet, you've come at the right                           
          time.                                                      
          Fantasos engages her with hypnotic power. Peshet nods,     
          trance-like.                                               

                         FANTASOS
          One night soon, a gong will sound
          three times. When you hear it,
          unlock the back gate of the
          Basilica. Then go to Andromeda's
          chambers...
          (hands her a dagger)
          . and bring the Princess out.
          My men will take her to Leviathan.
          Peshet just stares at the dagger, hands trembling.         

                         FANTASOS
          Do you understand me?
          (harshly, off her non-

                         RESPONSE)
          Peshet, do you understand how
          important your part is?
          She nods, horrified by her predicament.

          The Alkali Lotus...
          She stops, spotting something in the distance. Kosmo

          weapon ready.

          INT. TENT - DAY

          Spyros looks inside. A cauldron BUBBLES over a fresh
          fire. ALKALI LOTUS blossoms bob on the boiling broth.
          Spyros, uneasy, backs out.

          Draco, tell me what this --
          Everyone is standing perfectly still.                       
          DARK FIGURES surround them. The transformed Cleon Legion    
          lurches INTO VIEW. The only resemblance to the soldiers     
          they were is their armor.. Now they're monstrous            
          creatures: LOTOPHAGI.

          CLOSE ON A DEFORMED FOOT                                    
          as it plants in the dust. The companion foot lands          
          beside it -- completely different. TILT UP TO: Kalibos.     
          Perseus stands by Vidalia, watching the monsters.           
          Kalibos immediately focuses on the demigod. He sniffs       
          the air around Perseus.

           Spyros lobotomizes one with his harpoon. Amoun opens a

          Thad, Krikor and Perseus are the first there. Amoun
          tosses an arc of the black sand around them all. The
          ring of sand transforms into a dense, swirling swarm of     
          insects. Amoun shouts to the others, still fighting.

                         AMOUN
          Come on! You can pass through!
          Draco bolts for the barrier. A Lotophagi spears Kosmo,      
          killing him. Draco slides inside the swarm. He looks        
          back at Kosmo in horror.
          Polluc slashes zombies and runs toward the swarm. He's      
          almost there when one of the Lotophagi lands on him,        
          sinking fangs into his skull. Polluc sticks his sword
          into the creature; they both fall over dead. Icos and
          Spyros fight their way to the swarm and jump inside.
          Mongke and Tamburlane kill a Lotus-eater and leap over
          the corpse into the protected circle.                       
          The tide of HOWLING and SHRIEKING Lotophagi claw at the

          Perseus takes quick stock of the group inside the swarm,    
          thinking.

                         PERSEUS
          Only humans...
          He looks over the Lotophagi and sees Vidalia out there,
          alone, flinging sling-bullets as she fights her way
          toward the barrier.

                         PERSEUS

          Drop it, Amoun!
          At that moment, Kalibos grabs Vidalia and drags her to
          the top of an outcrop. At the top, he turns, LOOKS
          DIRECTLY AT PERSEUS and HOWLS, his message clear: "If
          you want to save her, come and get her." He hungrily
          rips her leather bandeau. Perseus turns to Amoun.

          Have you learned nothing? If you
          break out now, we're all at risk.
          On the boulder, Kalibos grabs Vidalia's white flesh.         
          Perseus is anguished; he knows he's in love.

          Get ready to defend yourselves!
          Perseus runs, plants a foot on Thad's back and leaps out
          through the swarm, which immediately dissipates around
          the humans. They have only a moment to react as the
          stunned Lotophagi come to their senses.

                         DRACO
          Let's kill these freks!
          Perseus runs over the backs of the Lotophagi. Hurtling
          off them, he scrambles up and knocks Kalibos off Vidalia.
          Ralibos rolls, flips onto his feet and gives Perseus a
          look: "You're the one that I want."
          They face off, looking for an opening. Perseus lunges,
          thrusting his sword. Kalibos dodges, springing up the
          rocks and then down toward Perseus, acrobatic as an ape.
          Perseus rolls out of the way.
          Perseus sweeps his sword at Kalibos' head. The monster       
          catches the blade in his jaws and SNAPS IT IN TWO!           
          Bloody spittle flies from his tongue.                        
          Kalibos pounces, pins Perseus. He opens his jaw and
          sinks his teeth into Perseus' shoulder. Vidalia cracks a
          rock into Kalibos' head. The creature whirls on Vidalia
          and careens toward her, head bloody.
          Perseus leaps in the air and catches Kalibos in the back     
          with both feet, knocking him over the edge.

                         CONTINUED:
          Kalibos slams down on the jagged boulders and ricochets
          off, pinwheeling through the air. The grotesque figure
          hits the lower rocks head-first and his neck CRUNCHES.
          He slams into the dust, dead.
          Perseus lands on his back, weak from the bite. When he       
          tries to rise, his legs are rubbery. Vidalia catches him
          as he falls forward and lowers him gently, looking at the
          bloody puncture wounds.

                         VIDALIA

                         (SOOTHING)
          Okay... sshh... I've got you.
          A THUNDEROUS SOUND SURGES in the distance. Vidalia scans
          the horizon.

                         DOWN BELOW
          Draco, Spyros, Amoun and the others hack away, fending
          off the Lotophagi. Outnumbered, they won't last long.
          The earth VIBRATES. The Lotophagi are distracted,
          looking around nervously.
          Over a rise stampede SCORPIOCHS, rhino-sized scorpions.      
          Riding them, DJINN RAIDERS, flowing black silk masking       
          all but their blue eyes.                                     
          They lay into the Lotophagi. The Scorpiochs skewer the
          beasts with HUGE PINCERS. The Djinn use flashing             
          SCIMITARS to cut them down.                                  

          ATOP THE ROCKS
          in Vidalia's arms, the fading Perseus watches as the
          Djinn turn and surround the Expedition members, closing
          in.

                         PERSEUS
          Vidalia... we need to help them...
          He blacks out. Vidalia cranes to look over the edge of       
          the cliff where Kalibos fell. She is mystified by what       

                         SHE SEES:                                                    
          The deformed monster Kalibos is gone. In his place, neck     
          broken, lies a handsome, aging noble, finally at peace --    
          King Acrisius.

          EXT. SIROQUE MOUNTAINS - DJINN CARAVAN - NIGHT

          A STRING OF LIGHTS, each a lantern hanging from a
          Scorpioch's tail. The Expedition members ride on the
          Scorpioch with the Djinn. Some of the huge scorpions
          carry small box/rooms (palanquins) on their backs.

          INT. PALANQUIN - NIGHT

          Perseus lies sprawled on cushions, unconscious. Vidalia                                    
          replaces the dressing on his bite wound. Knowing he                                        
          cannot hear her --

                         VIDALIA
          To save me, you risked everything
          -- your mission, your friends...
          the fate of multitudes. Men need
          better judgment in the one who is
          meant to lead them...                                       
          No longer able to lecture, she regards him with love.       

                         TENDERLY --                                                 

                         VIDALIA
          You shouldn't have risked your
          life for me. It is a waste to                               
          save me when I'll be gone so soon.
          She strokes his hair and kisses his forehead.               

                         VIDALIA
          Thank you for your reckless
          disregard. Thank you, Perseus...
          Vidalia holds her palm above the floor and mutters a
          quick incantation. A small shoot APPEARS and SPROUTS FAT    
          PODS. Vidalia squeezes the salve from a pod and covers      
          Perseus' wound.                                             
          The wound bulges, then squirms deeper into Perseus.         
          Perseus shoots up, clutching his chest. Vidalia gently      
          lays him down.                                              
          Perseus gags. A VIPER WRIGGLES from his throat and          
          slithers away with the fat lump of infection in its         
          stomach.                                                    

                         VIDALIA

          Surviving Lotophagi chew on the bones of the fallen. One
          reaches hungrily for an Alkali Lotus in the sand, but
          suddenly the petals blacken and curl. The creature,
          spooked, sniffs the air.
          All at once, the Lotophagi age years in seconds and keel
          over, dead. The cause: Set the Void glides over,
          surveying the battlefield.

          The Expedition rides through a war-ravaged village of            
          stucco and thatch. DOORS and SHUTTERS CREAK shut as they

          The Skolothians have suffered more
          than their share in this war. The

                         SPYROS
          It's no wonder they shy away from
          all strangers.
          Perseus looks ahead, where the Expedition is parting        
          company with the Djinn Raiders. only one of the Djinn is    
          staying -- SHAIKH SULEIMAN, a veiled priest.

          granite pinnacles, one towering above the others.

          Tell me of them.

                         AMOUN
          They're witches in the form of
          Strix. Not a pleasant sight, a                              
          Strix. They have powerful magic                             
          and dreadful habits. Baby-eaters,
          among other things.
          (off Perseus' shock)
          But they owe me a favor. When the
          war broke out, they lent their
          power to men against the Gods in                            
          exchange for infant sacrifice.
          Tiamat struck them blind for their
          treachery. When they came for                               
          help, I fashioned them an
          artificial eye, for their Second                            
          Sight.

                         PERSEUS

          The Expedition sleeps in a drizzle.              
          WHISPERS. Shaikh Suleiman moves toward Perseus. The
          WHISPERING comes from behind his veil. He pulls a
          GLEAMING BRONZE SICKLE from his cloak. The priest, blade
          poised, stands over the sleeping Perseus.
          OUT OF THE DARKNESS runs Spyros, his harpoon raised for a
          strike.

                         SPYROS
          Stay away from my boy!
          Without touching him, the Shaikh throws the fisherman        
          over his head, where he lands hard with an "UMPH!"           
          Perseus jolts awake. He reaches for his sword, but has       
          none. Spyros struggles to his feet to start another          
          charge.
          Suleiman raises his hand and freezes Spyros in his           
          position. The Shaikh's veil has fallen, revealing his        
          frightening countenance: scaled skin of charred wood;        
          eyes like slots in a furnace. Perseus listens to the         

          WHISPERING.

                         PERSEUS
          Spyros, he means me no harm.                                 
          The Shaikh lowers his hand: Spyros falls into the dirt.
          The Shaikh pulls his veil over his face. He kneels
          before Perseus, head bowed.

                         PERSEUS
          I hear you and I understand you.
          But I don't know how.

          The Shaikh proffers the gleaming bronze sickle which has
          a zig-zag, LIGHTNING BOLT PATTERN engraved on the blade,
          honoring Zeus.

                         PERSEUS
          An offering'? I thank you and
          take it humbly, as agift from a
          friend, not an offering.
          He takes the weapon and bows his head, surprising the
          Shaikh.

                         SHAIKH SULEIMAN
          Tuj patir esti ho theos kosmosr.

          Ho Zeus Patir... Zeus...
          Perseus reacts, taken aback to hear it from this             
          mysterious stranger.

          regurgitated food, shredded garments and tiny human baby
          bones.
          A FLAP of WINGS and suddenly perched atop the stones are

          Each has one central EYE SOCKET; they share one              
          ARTIFICIAL ORB. The Strix toss the Eye between them and      
          pop it in to study the arrivals.

          You want us to tell you about
          Leviathan.

                         AMOUN
          You know already... of course.                               

                         VERDANDI
          We know this -- the Kraken cannot
          be defeated.

          You've wasted a journey. I trust
          it was not a taxing one.
          The Sisters CACKLE HORRIBLY. Skuld SWOOSHES down. Icos
          and Krikor, terrified, hit the deck. Skuld tosses the
          Eye back to Urd. Perseus watches with growing
          irritation.

                         AMOUN
          Surely the beast from the sea has
          some weakness. You owe me this
          answer at least.

                         URD
          The Sisters owe nothing to you or
          any Man!
          She tosses the Eye to Verdandi, who focuses her attention
          on Perseus.

                         VERDANDI
          There's something wrong with that
          one. I don't like having him
          here.

                         SKULD
          Let me take a look.
          Verdandi tosses the Eye to Skuld. Perseus leaps and          
          snags the Eye out of mid-air. The Strix SCREECH.             
          Perseus goes to the precipice.                               

                         PERSEUS
          Tell us what we want to know or
          your Eye has seen its last.

          No, good Sisters... the son of
          Zeus.
          The Strix react in horror and all land on the same
          monolith.

                         PERSEUS
          Since you cannot see, let me tell
          you what's about to happen. I'm
          about to throw this evil Eye to
          the rocks far below. I fear its
          journey will be a taxing one.
          The members of the Expedition are impressed; Vidalia,
          too: the young demigod shows growing leadership. The
          Strix are panicked --

                         URD
          We can't tell you. We don't dare
          betray Tiamat again.

          as blind as she made you.

                         SKULD
          No! Give us the Eye and we'll
          tell.

          The Norn Sisters confer, enclosed in a curtain of wings.

          The Strix are torn, frightened. Finally --

          The stare of Medusa. No creature
          can look directly in her eyes and
          still survive.
          The answer hangs in the silence of the stunned
          Expedition.

                         AMOUN
          They're lying, Perseus.
          Perseus studies the Sisters, weighing his response.

          I believe them.

          Here's your second sight.
          Verdandi launches and catches it in her beak, pops it in
          her socket.

                         PERSEUS
          (to the Norns)

          INT. VAULT OF THE NORN SISTERS - DAY

          Perseus fights through cobwebs and hanging roots. The        
          torch REVEALS piles of armor, bones, and broken weapons.     
          A round edge catches his eye. He pulls it free -- A
          SHIELD, TARNISHED AND DENTED. Unsure why it attracted
          him, he shoulders it and leaves.

          EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

          The STORM RAGES around a FLEET OF SHIPS, manned by
          armored CREWMEN, that rises and falls on hundred-foot
          mountains of water.

          EXT. DECK OF LEAD SHIP - NIGHT

          The FIRST MATE shouts to the stalwart CAPTAIN.

                         FIRST MATE
          Captain, the storm is too great!

                         CAPTAIN
          Joppa is under siege! King
          Kepheus needs these supplies!
          Something huge breaches the surface. The captain squints
          through the rain... and sees the GIGANTIC SCUTED TAIL of
          Leviathan. IT GOES RIGHT PAST THEM, miraculously leaving
          the fleet untouched.
          But then -- they HEAR a sound BIGGER than the typhoon.
          The dark sky gets darker as an ENORMOUS BLACK SHAPE
          appears behind the Fleet, bearing down on them at
          impossible speed --
          TIAMAT'S PALACE-GALLEON so dwarfs the Fleet that it PLOWS    
          THROUGH the other ships without noticing, obliterating       
          them in seconds, sending all hands to the depths.

          A bleak shore. A boulder jetty juts into the cold pewter
          sea and fades into the fog. Chunks of ice bob on the
          lapping waves.

          The Expedition, miserably wet, waits for passage around a

          shield he got from the Norns, looks to Amoun, who sits

          Medusa was a tender young woman
          once -- a mortal creature of such
          rare beauty as to tempt even the
          Gods. One night, on the road
          home, she caught the eye of the
          God of Deserts and Entropy -- Set
          the Void.

          FLASHBACK - EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

          A stunning beauty, YOUNG MEDUSA, carries a water pitcher.    
          Suddenly, frightened, she turns, sees something, drops       
          the pitcher and runs.                                        

          AMOUN (V.0.)
          She hastened to hallowed ground,
          thinking the Goddess Tiamat would
          protect her in her temple. But
          the God Set followed.
          A SHADOW passes swiftly over the shattered pitcher, in    
          pursuit.

          He ravished her on the cold floor.
          She felt the heartless passion of
          a God.

          SAME SCENE - LATER                                           
          Alone, Medusa crawls with bloody fingernails toward the      
          altar.                                                       

          AMOUN (V.0.)
          Despoiled and broken in the shadow
          of Tiamat's altar, she prayed for
          comfort and pleaded for courage...
          But the Goddess of the Deep
          regarded Medusa with disdain. The
          prayers of such a frail and filthy
          mortal angered Tiamat.
          A bust of Tiamat chiseled from black crystal opens her       
          BLAZING eyes, THROWING A LONG SHADOW OF MEDUSA onto the

          into a loathsome new thing...                                
          The contorting shadow shows the transformation. Legs
          twist and snap and become a slithering tail. Snake heads
          wriggle from her skull.

          Grave silence. Draco realizes he's burned his dinner on                                   
          the fire. Spyros shakes his head. Perseus just stares,                                    
          a believer.

          The prow of the galley cuts through ice. Rows of oars
          slice the frigid water, pulling the boat through at a
          steady clip.

          INT. GALLEY - BELOW DECK - DAY

          Dark, hot and loud: PIPES, STEAM, GEARS and PISTONS.
          CHARON, a grizzled old sea captain, shovels coal and
          slams the furnace closed. He walks past his "crew"          --
          MECHANICAL OARSMEN of tarnished brass, rowing tirelessly.
          Charon dons furs, then climbs up to --

          EXT. GALLEY - UPPER DECK - DAY

          -- an icy, slick deck, snow. The Expedition huddle
          around stoves, miserable. We HEAR the OARS BEAT, the
          HULL GROAN, the ICE CRACKING. Charon CHORTLES, his VOICE
          deeper than the sea --

                         CHARON
          Better stoke those fires, boys,
          it's going to get cold soon.

          INT. HOLD - DAY

          In a small space among the stores, Vidalia circles
          Perseus, whose eyes are shut. Suddenly, she sweeps his
          legs out. He lands hard.

                         VIDALIA
          She's got a tail and she'll use it
          just like that.
          Perseus opens his eyes.

                         VIDALIA
          Keep your eyes shut! Open them
          with Medusa and it will be your
          last look.

          Good!
          Pleased, he doesn't sense her right cross, which knocks

          Do you think the Gorgon will hit
          once and then surrender her head?
          He gets up, eyes closed, and resumes the defensive
          position, turning as she moves around him.                  

                         VIDALIA
          Listen... you will hear her
          muscles coil. Feel her hunger in                            
          your gut. Ask, how will she feed

          You can. You're the son of a God.

          Spyros is at the rail, looking over the ocean of ice.

          wood. BLUE FIRE shoots out his neck, ENVELOPING THE         
          CENTAUR. The burning Centaur crumples, dead.                
          Ixion SLAMS his mace down, just missing Amoun. Suddenly,

          silhouette of MEDUSA: HAIR OF HISSING SNAKES atop a
          woman's torso, the body of a mammoth reptile.
          WE SEE only GLIMPSES of Medusa as she slides through the
          shadows. Her forked tongue tastes the air.
          CUTTING BETWEEN Spyros, Perseus and Draco, moving
          silently on opposite sides of the sanctuary.
          OUR VIEW of Draco is suddenly BLOCKED by Medusa -- she      
          coils around Draco without touching him. He HEARS the       
          RASP of SCALES ON STONE.

          I hear her, Perseus. She's near!
          Her torso behind him, she RATTLES her tail in front.
          Draco spins and slices the air. The RATTLE stops. Draco
          waits, confused.

          Draco, be wary --                                           !
          Medusa gingerly tugs Draco's blindfold free. Draco sees               
          the tail before him. Unthinking, he instinctively spins               
          and looks.
          Medusa's face is inches from Draco's. His muscles lock                
          and his flesh hardens to scabrous stone, emanating SMOKY              
          GAS. Medusa breathes in the vapors ecstatically.                      
          AT THAT MOMENT a hole blasts through the roof of the                  
          cavern as Ixion crashes down in a cloud of dirt -- dead,              
          a gaping wound in his head.                                           
          Medusa regards her fallen minion in horror, loosing a        

          MOURNFUL SIGH.                                               
          Spyros HEARS HER and blindly hurls his harpoon toward the
          sound.
          WITH THE HARPOON as its sails cleanly through slanted        
          pillars and debris, WHOOSH, WHOOSH, until it comes
          through a tiny opening and --
          THUDS into Medusa's body! The Monster SCREAMS, whipping      
          about. She tries to pull the harpoon out, but can't.         

          SPYROS                                                      (O.S.)
          Perseus, I think she's hit!

          PERSEUS                                                     (O.S.)
          Where?

          SPYROS                                                      (O.S.)
          Near to the left!
          Medusa's enraged attention shifts back and forth between
          the VOICES of the two men, deciding which to attack.
          Perseus tries to control his shakes, jumping at every                 
          sound, head swiveling blindly. From a distance --                     

          SPYROS                                                      (O.S.)
          Perseus... I don't hear her near
          me!
          Perseus steps back and BUMPS into a column.

          Medusa is coiled around the column, harpoon stuck in her     
          bloody side. She CRAWLS DOWN toward Perseus.                 
          Perseus against the column. FROM THE TOP OF FRAME,           
          Medusa's fingers reach for his blindfold. She pulls the      
          knot and the blindfold falls.                                
          Eyes closed, Perseus slashes the air, sweeping the sickle    
          about until it SMASHES into the column -- BRINNNGI The       
          SOUND ECHOES, then FADES.                                    
          Perseus waits and listens. Then, PING!, one drop of
          Medusa's blood lands on his shield.                          
          Perseus opens his eyes and peers into his shield. In the     
          reflection on the bronze, he SEES: Movement. Snakes.         
          Searing eyes... Medusa!
          Eyes shut, he windmills his weapon above him. Medusa's       
          talons DEFLECT the blade and the sickle flies from his
          grip.                                                        
          Perseus scrambles for it on his hands and knees. Behind
          him, Medusa SLITHERS down the column and heads for           
          Perseus.
          Perseus reaches the sickle. He lifts his shield up in
          front of him and sees Medusa's reflection growing closer
          behind him.
          He shuts his eyes and wheels around, blade sweeping. A       
          soft F-THMMP as the blade slices through something...
          SILENCE. Perseus turns away and opens his eyes, looking
          into the shield. Still, Medusa looms behind him!             
          But suddenly, Medusa's head THUDS and rolls on the
          ground. The headless reflection topples over, dead.         r-

          THE AFTERMATH: the survivors -- Vidalia, Amoun, Mongke,
          and Tamburlane -- take mournful stock of their losses.
          Mongke sees something, smiles and SWEARS in his language.
          They all turn to see:
          Perseus and Spyros, spent and saddened, stand at the top
          of the Temple steps. Perseus grasps the canvas sack.
          Now it holds Medusa's head, which bloodies the whole bag
          and sends a crimson drip to the stones. There is still       
          movement in there -- squirming serpents.

          The relief fleet is lost.
          Monsters gather outside our walls.
          Soon I won't be able to keep my
          own people at bay. And still, no
          word from the Expedition.
          Kepheus raises a spyglass to survey the view beyond the    
          city walls.

          It's time I shared this burden
          you've carried so long.

          Eleven stadia to the South... What
          is 'Polis of Jove Pater'? I'm
          ignorant of this.

                         AMOUN
          Jove the Father is another name by
          which Zeus was known. This
          milestone dates from when city
          states were named for their patron
          deities.

          EXT. FOREST TRAIL (ILLYRIA)   - MAGIC HOUR

          The Expedition passes through deep woods. Spyros and
          Perseus ride side by side.

                         PERSEUS
          Father, we've seen much on this
          journey we cannot hold in our
          hands. Yet these things are real
          enough. At each turn, we find
          monsters and Gods.

                         SPYROS
          Yes, the evidence is everywhere
          once we leave our island. That's
          why I so rarely leave. These
          Gods, what do you make of them?

                         PERSEUS                                                    
          As you always said, they're petty,                         
          vengeful... and dangerous.                                 

                         SPYROS
          Yes, as bad as men.
          (as Perseus smiles)
          And would you have that sort guide
          your life?

                         PERSEUS
          No. Men must be accountable to
          themselves. Otherwise we serve
          poor masters.

          We must keep moving. Time is                               
          running out.

          If we don't rest the horses, they

          left when you face the Kraken.
          Riding behind them, Vidalia (paler and more ephemeral
          than ever) is suddenly alert. She peers into the woods,
          agitated. Then she EXCLAIMS SOFTLY, dismounts and runs
          into the woods.

                         PERSEUS

          Vidalia darts through the trees. She stops, closes her

          stops, searching her senses. Perseus arrives and watches    
          her.

                    VIDALIA
          I know this place...
          Suddenly, she hurries to the trunk of an ancient tree.

          motionless before a bare altar.

          I know they were humans. They
          seemed so fragile. I sheltered
          them because I thought the harsh
          world would break them. Now I

          Resilient. Fearless.

          A marble tablet sits on the altar, its surface defaced.

          found.

          My true name was carved here.

                         PERSEUS
          Where is she?                                              

                         AMOUN                                                      
          This is my fault. I've permitted                           
          .this infatuation to progress too
          far.

                         PERSEUS
          It is not yours to permit,                                 
          Master... with respect.                                    
          Vidalia comes down into the shrine, her apron full of      
          berries.                                                   

                         VIDALIA
          Look what I've found for us --                             
          She startles when she sees Amoun, dropping the berries.    

                         AMOUN

                         (TO VIDALIA)
          Have you forgotten Perseus is                              
          engaged to the Princessa?                                  

                         PERSEUS
          I won't marry Andromeda.

          Both Amoun and Vidalia are surprised.

                         AMOUN
          If by some miracle you survive
          this encounter with Leviathan, the                          
          hand of the Princessa is your
          reward.

          I want no reward.                                           

                         AMOUN
          Are you so selfish? Would you                               
          risk everything for the foolish
          love of --
          A BLAST of HOT DESERT WIND blows into the Shrine. The       
          berries turn brown and shrivel.                             
          Amoun grabs his chest. Perseus and Vidalia crumple in       
          agony.
          SET THE VOID COMES INTO THE SHRINE. Amoun tries to          
          invoke a spell, but Set touches his chest and Amoun         
          splits open.                                                
          Set points at Vidalia, slamming her into the earthen        
          wall. The God is there in an instant, strangling her.       
          Perseus staggers up and swings his sickle, but Set          
          points, ripping the weapon from Perseus' hand. It flies     
          across the shrine and sinks with a CLANG into the tablet    
          that once held Vidalia's true name.                         
          Still choking Vidalia, Set grabs Perseus' arm. Perseus      
          doubles over, paralyzed by the God's touch. Suffocating,    
          Vidalia FADES MORE.                                         
          Immobilized, Perseus watches her struggle and searches      

                         HIS BEING:                                                  

                         PERSEUS

          I am half God... and now is the                             
          time...                                                     
          Perseus rises. He cocks his arm and clobbers Set with an
          ear-splitting CRACK OF THUNDER and a sparking BURST OF
          WHITE ENERGY. Set drops Vidalia and lurches back,
          aghast. BLACK BLOOD shoots from his mouth.
          Perseus, his face contorted in rage, chokes Set. The        
          God's body SPASMS and deforms in DEATH THROES.

                         CONTINUED:
          Perseus slams the God down in a ghastly heap, which
          liquefies into thick black blood. It seeps into the
          sandy floor, leaving an ugly stain.                          
          Perseus rushes to embrace Vidalia, who is more evanescent
          than ever. They look with pain at the remains of Amoun.      

                         VIDALIA
          I'm so sorry, Perseus.
          A look of brutal, determined resolve grows in Perseus'       
          face.                                                        

                         VIDALIA

                         (IN AWE)
          You faced a God in lethal
          combat... and vanquished him.
          Never have I heard of such a
          thing.
          He looks at her, mind racing, then lifts her as he           
          stands.

                         PERSEUS
          We must go quickly now.
          He pulls the sickle from the marble with a BRINNG! The
          light flashes off Zeus' LIGHTNING BOLT PATTERN on the
          blade.

                         PERSEUS
          The combat has just begun.

          INT. HIDDEN SANCTUARY OF TIAMAT (JOPPA)   - NIGHT

          Fantasos and the LEADERS of the Revolution are gathered
          around a SACRIFICIAL FIRE. They fill the room with their

          CHANTING.

          Fantasos moves through smoke to an altar, on which is a      
          fearsome IDOL OF TIAMAT, unlike any representation we've     
          seen.

          Loyal servants...
          it may be an illusion, but the Idol seems to have taken      
          on the most subtle of life. It does not move, but it         
          breathes.                                                    

          TIAMAT (V.0.)
          You have sown the seeds of revolt.
          Now comes the harvest. My legions
          stand ready at the gates. Only
          one rite of consecration remains
          before the Ascension.
          Fantasos, closest to the Idol, flinches, buffeted by an
          unseen draft.

          INT. THE BASILICA - ROYAL CHAMBERS - NIGHT

          A GONG sounds ONCE in the night. Repheus sleeps fitfully
          on a divan by the bed of the desiccated Cassiopeia.

          INT. ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

          The GONG sounds again. CLOSE ON Andromeda's tortured
          face staring down at the city -- too CLOSE to see exactly
          where she is.

          EXT. THE BASILICA - BACK GATE - NIGHT

          The GONG sounds a THIRD TIME. Peshet opens a lock and
          sets the heavy gate ajar. She looks at the dagger in her
          palm and hurries inside.
          After a moment, four CLOAKED REBELS slip through the open    
          gate.

          Peshet enters, dagger held at her back. No sign of
          Andromeda.

                         PESHET
          My lady? Princess Andromeda?
          She goes deeper into the rooms, then GASPS, looking off,

                         ALARMED --
          Andromeda stands on the balustrade of her balcony,
          preparing to jump to her death. She turns at the sound,      
          teetering.                                                   
          Peshet rushes to her but stops when Andromeda raises a       
          knife of her own. Peshet is shocked, not afraid.             

                         ANDROMEDA
          Peshet, stop! I know what I am                               
          meant to do.

          My lady, please --

                         ANDROMEDA
          I was afraid, Peshet. Afraid to                              
          understand that the fate of so                               
          many could rest with me.                                     

                         PESHET
          Princessa, give me your hand.
          Andromeda, please. Please.

          I'm not afraid anymore. I will do                            
          what I must. I will die so that                              
          they may live.

                         R
          She turns, but Peshet leaps and grabs her, pulling her to    
          safety. They fall to the floor, both daggers CLATTERING      
          on the marble.                                               

                         PESHET
          I won't allow it, my lady. Today,                            
          you are only a Princess. One day
          your people may need a Queen ready                           
          to die for them.
          Peshet snatches up the dagger from where she dropped it.

                         PESHET                                                      C

          Good.

          EXT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

          Peshet leads Andromeda out.

                         ANDROMEDA
          We must get to my mother and
          father.
          A VOICE from the darkness:

          AGENOR (O.S.)
          Your father is dead and your
          mother has been relieved of her                              
          suffering.                                                   
          The four Cloaked Rebels step into the light. Agenor          
          wipes his bloody dagger on his cloak as all four advance.

                         AGENOR
          The Princessa is coming with us.
          She has a rendezvous to keep.
          Peshet WHIPS HER DAGGER through the air; it THUDS into
          the neck of the First Rebel, killing him on his feet.
          Before he can fall, Peshet leaps to him and pulls out her    
          knife. She plants herself in front of Andromeda.             

                         PESHET
          Come and get her.                                            
          Agenor and the other two circle Peshet. She moves with       
          feline agility, but is separated from the Princess. To       
          the Second Rebel --

          Take the Princess -- alive!                                  
          The Second Rebel circles around Peshet toward Andromeda.

          Run, Princess! Save yourself.                                
          Peshet leaps on the Third Rebel.                             
          Andromeda runs away from the Second Rebel, who easily        
          closes the gap.

          He grabs her in a bear hug from behind. She spins, tiny
          within his massive arms, and is suddenly facing him. He
          JOLTS in surprise, Andromeda's knife in his belly. He
          falls on her, dead.
          Peshet wins her struggle with the Third Rebel, sinking
          her dagger in him. She GASPS. Agenor has thrust his
          blade into her ribs. She totters and COUGHS -- deep and
          bloody. Peshet falls against the wall.
          Andromeda WAILS at the sight. She is pinned beneath the      
          dead weight of the Second Rebel, unable to move. Agenor      
          finishes off Peshet and turns to the Princess.

          FROM BEHIND THE GROUP
          They're on a shelf above the wide, flat basin that lies      
          outside Joppa. A limitless INHUMAN ARMY -- Centaurs,         
          Minotaurs, Monsters of every stripe -- fills the plain,      
          right up to the city walls.

          Among the regiments of Joppans waiting nervously for the     
          battle are ranks of fifteen-foot AUTOMATA (CLOCKWORK         
          SOLDIERS). OPERATORS feverishly work the mechanisms of       
          the steel soldiers, which flex their artificial limbs and
          weigh their massive weapons.

          Mongke and Tamburlane exchange words. For the first

          they can triumph.. They need only
          one thing.
          Perseus turns to her, a question on his face -- "Tell

          Agenor's thugs chain her to the winch at the precipice,     
          hundreds of feet above the raging sea. As the winch is      
          cranked, the chain lifts Andromeda upside down from the     
          ground.
          Agenor pulls Andromeda close and flashes a cruel grin.      
          She spits in his eye. He wipes his eyes and lets go of

          A mile offshore, a BULGE OF WATER SWELLS and plows toward

          Leviathan's eyes break the surface below, watching          
          Andromeda. With a HOWL, Leviathan HURTLES UPWARDS, jaws

          The monster slides back down, clutching the chain in its

          UP ON THE PLATFORM
          The chain unreels wildly, pulls tight... and rips the

          Perseus grips both the chain and the bag in his hand.        
          Leviathan spirals on, but THE WINCH CATCHES ON A REEF and    
          the chain SNAPS! Andromeda, suddenly separated from the      
          monster, sinks, weighted by her shackles.                    
          Perseus, swimming with the raw power of a porpoise, dives    
          after her, but loses his grip on the bag. Desperate, he      
          looks back and forth: Andromeda, the sack -- both
          sinking. Perseus goes after the sack.                        
          Leviathan realizes it has lost the Princess. Huge eyes
          darting, it spots Andromeda and surges down after her.
          Andromeda, drowning, passes out. Tiny bubbles leak from      
          her nose. Leviathan swims down to her, eye as big as her     
          entire body.
          The wreck of a SUNKEN WHALER rests on the ocean floor.
          The Medusa sack FALLS INTO VIEW and catches on a harpoon
          wedged in the deck. Perseus appears, snags the sack and
          is about to kick upward. On impulse, he grabs the
          harpoon.
          Leviathan opens its huge jaws. Andromeda is sucked           
          toward the maw.
          Perseus swims upward toward Leviathan's tail. Perseus        
          concentrates -- a sparking BURST OF WHITE ENERGY shoots      
          through his forearm to the harpoon in his grip.
          LIGHTNING CRACKLES and BOILS the water. He plunges the
          harpoon in the Kraken's tail --
          -- at the same moment Leviathan inhales the unconscious
          Andromeda.
          Contact -- an ELECTRIC FLASH-POINT FLARES and a charge       
          races up Leviathan's spine. Jolted, the monster spits        
          Andromeda out.                                               
          The Kraken twists to lock its enraged gaze on Perseus.       
          Perseus shuts his eyes and yanks Medusa's head from the
          sack. Medusa's hellish eyes ignite channels of boiling
          energy into Leviathan's enormous eyeballs -- hardening
          them to boiled eggs, then rocky spheres.

          the scuted tail locks mid-flail into a final, permanent
          hook.
          Dead in the water, the grotesque mass sinks like a

                         ABYSS                                                       --                                                           
          Perseus must swim like a God to snatch Andromeda from the    
          downward tug. The stone Kraken barely misses them as it      

                         DROPS --                                                     
          -- and CRASHES in a cloud of silt, SHAKING THE OCEAN
          FLOOR like an earthquake. A CRACK opens in the seabed
          and sucks back the silt. The trench deepens and streaks
          away across the seabed, swallowing all the water above
          it, creating a giant opening to the sky.

          EXT. TIAMAT'S PALACE-GALLEON                                (OCEAN)                                                     - PROW - DAY     

          Tiamat's face contorts, sensing her beloved Leviathan is
          dead. She turns at the sound of GHASTLY CREAKING -- the
          immense length of the galleon buckles into a hole in the
          ocean. As the towering masts drop below wave-level,
          Tiamat raises her arms to the sky --

                         TIAMAT
          I damn you, Zeus! You will hear
          my curses forever in the crash of

                         SURF                                                        --
          Walls of water collapse, burying the Goddess, her ship,                      
          and her malediction deep in her realm. We HEAR a world-                      
          rocking ROAR, which booms off toward --                                      

          EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

          Tiamat's Monster Army is DEAFENED by the BOOM, losing all    
          spirit with the unmistakable certainty that their Goddess    
          is gone.                                                     
          THE TIDE TURNS IN THE BATTLE as the Joppans and their        
          steel allies, the Automata, wade into the ranks of           
          creatures.                                                   
          Mongke and Tamburlane, in the center of the battle, find
          the opposition turning tail. They roar and lift their
          weapons high, surviving yet another fight. Spyros,
          bloodied but unbowed, smiles wide and sits down in the
          mud, exhausted.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          114.

          EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - DAY

          The water stills. The sea calms. No sign of Perseus or
          Andromeda. WIND and QUIET...
          CHOOM! Perseus surfaces with Andromeda in his arms,          

          GASPING FOR AIR.

          EXT. CLIFFS OF JOPPA - DAY

          The onlookers rejoice.

          EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - DAY

          BACK WITH Perseus and Andromeda. He looks at her             
          lifeless countenance in agony -- has he failed again as      
          he did with Anteros the fisherman??                          
          Distraught, his muscles go taut around Andromeda, and a      
          short powerful burst of electric energy shoots from his
          arms into her still body -- SHE JOLTS TO LIFE!               
          Movement! Breath! Color returns to her face. Perseus,
          too, breathes again, relieved.
          For the first time since the start of the adventure, they
          find themselves alone, holding each other.

                         PERSEUS
          Hello.
          (as she smiles,

                         RELIEVED)
          Are you all right?
          She takes a moment, doing an inventory. Finally, she
          nods.

                         ANDROMEDA
          I think I am.
          He smiles. She'll never know how close they came to          
          oblivion.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Are you ready to become a king?
          His expression is kind, but unmistakable. "No." She          
          accepts that, rueful.

                          

                         PERSEUS
          Are you ready to become a queen?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          115.

                         CONTINUED:
          She thinks about it, her face beginning to light with
          confidence.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Yes. Yes, I am.

                         PERSEUS
          Then you're ready to go home.
          Perseus raises one arm. The-AIR reverberates to a LOUD      
          BEATING OF WINGS. Andromeda looks up in wonder.
          Pegasus appears out of the sun's glare, gracefully          
          alighting on the water. Perseus helps Andromeda up and
          then climbs on behind her.
          Pegasus takes off. TILT UP WITH them until they are lost    
          from sight.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. BLUE SKY AND WHITE CLOUDS - DAY

          Black smoke RISES to dirty the perfect sky. TILT DOWN

                         TO:

          EXT. SACRED GROUND - DAY

          The Sacred Ground of Joppa in the verdant hills, above      
          the sea, is so beautiful it might be mistaken for           
          Olympos.
          TWO FUNERAL PYRES burn. The citizens of Joppa, by the       
          thousands, commend King Kepheus and Queen Cassiopeia to     
          the afterlife.                                              
          MOVING OVER THE CROWD, WE PUSH THROUGH the flame to find    
          the new ruler of Joppa. Mournful, but cloaked in regal      
          dignity and strength -- QUEEN ANDROMEDA.                    

                         CUT TO:

          A DISTANT POV OF THE QUEEN
          The ceremony and the heavenly setting.

                         PERSEUS
          Perseus views the scene from a nearby hill. Behind him,
          Pegasus waits patiently, grazing the grass. Until --        

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          116.

                         CONTINUED:
          -- the equine suddenly WHINNIES and REARS UP. Just as
          quickly, Pegasus goes silent and BOWS DOWN. Perseus          
          looks in that direction, to find --
          ZEUS the Prime, God of Gods, an eagle perched on his arm.
          He couldn't look more imposing.

                         ZEUS
          Am I to understand you do not
          intend to make this union with the
          Queen Andromeda?

                         PERSEUS
          Yes.

                         ZEUS
          Despite my will and intention that
          you do so?

                         PERSEUS
          Yes.

                         ZEUS
          Would you choose to condemn Men,
          your own people, to suffer more of
          this devastating War?

                         PERSEUS
          I have no people. You have
          stranded me between realms,
          neither man nor God.

                         ZEUS

                         (STERNLY)
          Do you reproach Zeus?

                         PERSEUS
          No. I thank you... Father.
          Zeus, mighty God, reacts to the word. His expression
          softens and he looks on Perseus with growing pride.

                         PERSEUS
          You have freed me. I will not be
          a pawn for Men or Gods.

                         ZEUS
          Does that absolve you suddenly of
          your responsibilities?

                         PERSEUS
          You've made me understand that my
          responsibility is to myself. So
          it is with us all.

                         CONTINUED:

                         PERSEUS

                         (INTIMATELY)
          You've put me to a great test. In
          the midst of it, I found the
          courage in my heart to defy Gods.
          I do not know how much of that
          comes from you, Father... and how
          much from my Mother, who I never
          knew.
          Zeus starts, subtly, at the mention of Queen Danae.

                         PERSEUS
          It matters not. Whatever the
          source, I are only grateful.
          He looks off toward the funeral pyres and the human
          throng.

                         PERSEUS
          This war will end the moment you
          choose for it to end... and Men
          agree. I think, perhaps, that is
          the free will that all realms
          share.
          Zeus looks at him, proud, yet wistful -- what an
          offspring, what a creation!

                         ZEUS
          What will you do, Man of free
          will?
          Perseus motions Pegasus forward, and swings up onto his
          back.

                         PERSEUS
          I'm going to find Vidalia.

                         ZEUS
          So... my Son, you will be a pawn
          for love?

                         PERSEUS

                         (LAUGHS)
          Yes, Father, gladly.
          Perseus spurs Pegasus and launches into the sky. And
          soars away.

          FADE OUT.

                         THE END
