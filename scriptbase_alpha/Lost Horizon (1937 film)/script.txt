                         CLOSE-UP of an impressive-looking book. 
                         The covers open and the pages turn.

                         In these days of wars and rumors of 
                         wars - haven't you ever dreamed of a 
                         place where there was peace and security, 
                         where living was not a struggle but 
                         a lasting delight?
                                      
                         The second page reads:
                                     
                         Of course you have. So has every man 
                         since Time began. Always the same dream. 
                         Sometimes he calls it Utopia - sometimes 
                         the Fountain of Youth - sometimes merely 
                         "that little chicken farm."

                         One man had such a dream and saw it 
                         come true. He was Robert Conway - England's 
                         "Man of the East" - soldier, diplomat, 
                         public hero—

                         Our story starts in the war-torn Chinese 
                         city of Baskul, where Robert Conway 
                         has been sent to evacuate ninety white 
                         people before they are butchered in 
                         a local revolution.

                         1. LONG SHOT
                                     
                         The field is aflare with floodlights 
                         - on one side is an office building 
                         - on the other are hangars. The whole 
                         field is filled with Chinese refugees 
                         running around wildly. An Army transport 
                         is in front of the office building, 
                         motors going.

                         Showing in the distance, probably several 
                         miles away, the effect of a burning 
                         city, which is Baskul. Over the shot 
                         we hear the steady boom-boom of gunfire. 
                         In the f.g., we see the silhouetted 
                         figures of Chinese running away from 
                         Baskul and toward the Camera, their 
                         personal packs on their backs.

                         Toward office building. Conway comes 
                         out of the building, followed by a small 
                         group of white people with frightened 
                         faces. They have to fight their way 
                         through a horde of milling Chinese.
 
                                                              
                         4. MEDIUM SHOT
                                     
                         As Conway and group finally reach the 
                         plane where Conway forces the white 
                         people in. In this he is aided by his 
                         brother, George, a young and vigorous 
                         Englishman. The pilot sticks his head 
                         out of the cockpit.

                         PILOT
                                     
                         Conway, we can't take more than seven!
 
                                                              
                         Conway pulls a passenger out and gives 
                         the pilot a signal to start.

                         All right. I'm sorry. There will be 
                         another plane in a minute. All right 
                         - go on.

                         Motors roar, and the plane starts to 
                         move, scattering those of the Chinese 
                         who were unfortunately too close to 
                         the ship. Conway and George rush back 
                         into the office building.

                         There are about thirty white refugees, 
                         men, women and several children. They 
                         all lift their panicky faces to Conway 
                         and George as they enter. A barrage 
                         of questions are flung at them.

                         Are there any more planes? Do you think 
                         the bandits will come here? Please take 
                         my wife next, Mr. Conway!

                         plenty of planes coming. Now everybody 
                         have patience. Everything will be all 
                         right.
                                      
                         He crosses to a back room.

                         the ground.
                                      
                         George is pushing off Chinese.

                         Come on! Quick! This way.
                                     
                         22. MED. SHOT AT PLANE
                                     
                         When Conway and others approach, George 
                         helps Gloria Stone up, while Conway 
                         faces the mob, punching at those who 
                         try to wedge their way forward. Finally 
                         one of them manages to get his foot 
                         on the step, and Conway pushes him violently.

                         Who staggers back and falls, sprawling. 
                         As he hits the ground, he yells:
                                      
                         MAN
                                     
                         You can't leave me here, you blighter.[2] 
                         I'm a British subject!
                                      
                         We meet Alexander P. Lovett.

                         Conway looks his surprise and lifts 
                         him off the ground.

                         Glaring off toward Conway, picks up 
                         a board and starts toward Conway.

                         George emerges in time to see the Chinese 
                         lift the board and about to clout Conway 
                         on the head. George moves quickly, puts 
                         out his left hand, wards off the blow 
                         and with his right he punches the Chinese, 
                         who reels out of the scene.
                                      
                         GEORGE

                         A shadowy figure materializes in the 
                         cockpit, and clubs Fenner from behind. 
                         He shoves Fenner aside and takes his 
                         place.

                         Conway pushes George up and starts to 
                         mount himself. He looks off - and what 
                         he sees startles him.

                         All right, Fenner! Go ahead!

                         Of what Conway sees. Several trucks 
                         loaded with bandits - in makeshift uniforms 
                         - come tearing up the road - come to 
                         a stop. Some fire toward plane - others 
                         are setting up machine guns. Droves 
                         of refugees scramble to cover.

                         Already present are Barnard, an American; 
                         Gloria Stone, the prostitute; and Lovett, 
                         whom we saw dressed as a Chinese. Conway 
                         slams the door shut - looks off - then 
                         cries:

                         Get down on the floor, everybody. Go 
                         ahead, Fenner!
                                      
                         They all fall on their faces.

                         As the plane swings around - taxies 
                         crazily - and leaves the ground, accompanied 
                         by gunfire of the bandits.

                         The occupants are still on the floor. 
                         Conway rises and glances out of a window, 
                         warily.

                         There are murmurs of "Yes" - "I'm all 
                         right" - as they raise themselves.

                         I have here a discovery that will startle 
                         the world. It's the vertebrae from the 
                         lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in 
                         Asia.

                         Wrapped carefully in absorbent cotton 
                         is something that resembles a dry chicken

                         pulls it away from him.

                         Barnard stares at Lovett unbelievingly.

                         Hello! Look what I found!
                                     
                         He crosses to Conway.
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Just what I needed too.
                                     
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         (looks up - smiling)
                                     
                         You?
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Just this once, Bob. I feel like celebrating. 
                         Just think of it, Bob - a cruiser sent 
                         to Shanghai just to take you back to 
                         England. You know what it means.
                                      
                         (hands him cup)
                                     
                         Here you are. Don't bother about those 
                         cables now. I want you to drink with 
                         me.
                                      
                         (holds his cup up)
                                     
                         Gentlemen, I give you Robert Conway 
                         - England's new Foreign Secretary.
 
                                                              
                         Conway watches him, amused. George gulps 
                         down his drink.
                                      
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         (after a slight hesitation - downing 
                         his drink)
                                      
                         Hurray!
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!

                         People are going to point to me and 
                         say, "There goes George Conway - brother 
                         of the Foreign Secretary."
                                      
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         Don't talk nonsense. Give me the bottle.
 
                                                              
                         Conway takes the bottle from him and 
                         pours himself a second drink.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         That's why they're sending for you, 
                         Bob. With all these foreign entanglements, 
                         it was bound to happen. They need you.
 
                                                              
                         Conway, with a poured drink in hand, 
                         laughs.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         All right, you can laugh if you want 
                         to. But who else can they get? Who else 
                         is there in all of England half the 
                         fighter, half the diplomat, who

                         has half your knowledge of the foreign 
                         situation? They can't stop you now, 
                         Bob.
                                      
                         Conway moodily pours himself a third. 
                         He downs the drink as we
                                      
                         DISSOLVE TO:

                         39. CLOSE SHOT OF CONWAY
                                     
                         We find Conway, asleep in his seat, 
                         his head on his hands. George approaches 
                         and tenderly spreads a jacket over his 
                         shoulders. Conway stirs, opens an eye.

                         (drunkenly)
                                     
                         Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report 
                         out yet?
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Yes, Bob.
                                     
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         Did you say we saved ninety white people?
 
                                                              
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Yes.
                                     
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         Hurray for us. Did you say that we left 
                         ten thousand natives down there to be 
                         annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. 
                         They don't count.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         You'd better try to get some sleep, 
                         Bob.
                                      
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         Just you wait until I'm Foreign Secretary. 
                         Can't you just see me, Freshie, with 
                         all those other shrewd, little Foreign 
                         Secretaries?
                                      
                         (confidentially - screws up face)
                                     
                         You see, the trick is to see who can 
                         out-talk the other. Everybody wants 
                         something for nothing, and if you can't 
                         get it with smooth talk, you send an 
                         army in. I'm going to fool them, Freshie. 
                         I'm not going to have an army. I'm going 
                         to disband mine. I'm going to sink my 
                         battleships - I'm going to destroy every 
                         piece of warcraft. Then when the enemy 
                         approaches we'll say, "Come in, gentlemen 
                         - what can we do for you?" So then the 
                         poor enemy soldiers will stop and think. 
                         And what will they think, Freshie? They'll 
                         think to themselves - "Something's wrong 
                         here. We've been duped. This is not 
                         according to form. These people seem 
                         to be quite friendly, and why should 
                         we shoot them?" Then they'll lay down 
                         their arms. You see how simple the whole 
                         thing is? Centuries of tradition kicked 
                         right in the pants—
                                      
                         (pause - drily)
                                     
                         —and I'll be slapped straight into the 
                         nearest insane asylum.
                                      
                         He starts to pour himself another drink.

                         GEORGE
                                     
                         You'd better not drink any more, Bob. 
                         You're not talking sense.
                                      
                         Conway downs the drink, and then chuckles 
                         cynically.
                                      
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         Don't worry, George. Nothing's going 
                         to happen. I'll fall right into line. 
                         I'll be the good little boy that everybody 
                         wants me to be. I'll be the best little 
                         Foreign Secretary we ever had, just 
                         because I haven't the nerve to be anything 
                         else.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Do try to sleep, Bob.

                         Huh? Oh, sure, Freshie. Good thing, 
                         sleep.
                                      
                         He grunts and squirms. George tucks 
                         him in.

                         He gets settled. George relaxes and, 
                         leaning back, shuts his eyes.

                         It is quiet. All are asleep. CAMERA 
                         MOVES FORWARD SLOWLY until it reaches 
                         the glass panel leading to the cockpit. 
                         The pilot's face turns. Instead of Fenner 
                         we see a strange, Mongolian face - with 
                         sharp, piercing eyes. A half-smile plays 
                         across his mouth.

                         a mere speck, over the horizon.

                         The morning sun peeks over a mountain 
                         top. From the same direction, as if 
                         arriving with the sun, the ship looms 
                         up, and comes roaring toward us.

                         All are asleep except Lovett, who fidgets 
                         on his seat. Then Barnard stirs - opens 
                         his eyes - and stretches. As he does 
                         so, he sees that Lovett is awake.

                         Good morning, Lovey.

                         I beg your pardon.

                         Look here, young man.

                         Eh?
                                     
                         LOVETT
                                     
                         I didn't care for 'sister' last night, 
                         and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. 
                         My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.

                         I see.

                         I see.

                         Well, it's a good morning, anyway.

                         I'm never conversational before I coffee.
 
                                                              
                         Barnard glances out of the window, looks 
                         around outside thoughtfully.

                         Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? 
                         Say, we're supposed to be travelling 
                         east, aren't we?
                                      
                         LOVETT
                                     
                         Why, of course. Yes.
                                     
                         BARNARD
                                     
                         Well, it looks to me as if we're travelling 
                         west.
                                      
                         LOVETT
                                     
                         That's ridiculous.
                                     
                         BARNARD
                                     
                         Is it?

                         It certainly is.

                         Look here—

                         Any child knows how to tell direction. 
                         Any child. I don't care where the child 
                         is - in the air, on the earth, or in 
                         the sea. If you face the rising sun, 
                         your right hand is the north, and your 
                         left hand is the south—

                         I always get it twisted because I'm 
                         left-handed.

                         Well, you just reverse it. Your left 
                         hand is—
                                      
                         (tries to explain - gets confused and

                         What difference does it make what 'hand' 
                         you are? The north is the north!

                         in the east, and we're going away from 
                         it.

                         As he sulks by himself, looks around 
                         - locates the sun in back of him - smiles 
                         - satisfied he's right, throws a condescending 
                         glance over at Barnard - then suddenly 
                         his face clouds - the whole thing dawns 
                         on him.

                         I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai

                         Of course. That's what I told them last 
                         night. You can't expect a man to sail 
                         around in the dark.[5]

                         I'll talk to Fenner.

                         he knocks on the window.

                         up - and George finds himself staring 
                         into the face of the mysterious pilot. 
                         He takes an instinctive step backward. 
                         The pilot turns his head. CAMERA ANGLE

                         and shakes his shoulder.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Bob! Bob!
                                     
                         Conway stirs in his sleep, slowly opens 
                         his eyes, yawns and stretches. Throughout 
                         it, George speaks.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Wake up! Something's happened! It isn't 
                         Fenner in the cockpit!
                                      
                         Conway looks at him, glances off toward 
                         the others, and back at George.
                                      
                         CONWAY

                         Oh, stop it!
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         The bloke up there looks a Chinese, 
                         or a Mongolian, or something.

                         We're nowhere near Shanghai. We're going 
                         in the opposite direction.
                                      
                         This interests Conway and he looks out 
                         of the window.

                         Then rising, he crosses to cockpit. 
                         The others watch him expectantly.

                         Conway pounds on the panel. The face 
                         of the pilot appears in sight. Conway 
                         tries to ask him something in Chinese. 
                         The pilot glares at them for a second, 
                         then a gun is shoved out at them. Instinctively 
                         they back away.

                         The ship lurches - and they are thrown 
                         off balance. The panel has been snapped

                         Conway throws the monkey wrench into

                         Gloria is apparently indifferent to

                         eyes, too.

                         wheel around toward the opposite side. 
                         But from that direction too, a horde 
                         of natives dash toward them. Conway 
                         hesitates a second, and like a flash 
                         springs for the door. But he stops again, 
                         as he opens the door.

                         The occupants are hunched up in the 
                         corner of their seats. What little clothes 
                         they have, and what few blankets, are

                         There is silence for a moment before

                         be taking us so far on such a dangerous 
                         trip. No sense to it.
                                      
                         No one responds to his speculation and 
                         he lapses into silence.

                         Huh? I give it up. But this not knowing 
                         where you're going is exciting anyway.

                         Well, Mr. Conway, for a man who is supposed 
                         to be a leader, your do-nothing attitude 
                         is very disappointing.

                         Against a moonlit sky, we see a lone 
                         speck - the plane as it flies high above

                         through endless space.

                         The atmosphere is pervaded with a feeling 
                         of utter futility. The occupants are 
                         still slumped in the corners of their

                         Gloria has a fit of coughing. She grabs 
                         her throat - as she gasps for breath. 
                         Barnard, himself feeble and exhausted, 
                         glances over at her sympathetically.

                         Lovett sits with his chin helplessly 
                         on his chest, his mouth ludicrously 
                         open, his eyes popping. George, his 
                         teeth clenched, struggles against a 
                         desire to sob. Conway looks at him feelingly.

                         Conway's eyes never leave George, who 
                         finally unable to control himself, emits 
                         a sob - and rather ashamed, slaps his 
                         hand over his mouth and turns away.

                         Not knowing where you're going, or why, 
                         or what's waiting when you get there.
 
                                                              
                         George, with an effort, stifles another

                         She runs to one of the ship's doors 
                         and pounds on it with her fist, then 
                         tries to shove it open. A blast of frigid 
                         air throws her back. George and Conway 
                         manage to pry her off and pull her away. 
                         Sobbing pitifully, she lets Conway steer 
                         her back to her seat, where she bundles 
                         up in torturous pain. For a moment nothing 
                         is heard but her stifled moans.

                         Unexpectedly the cockpit panel opens, 
                         and the pilot tosses something out in

                         a loud, sputtering noise from the outside. 
                         They all react - listen for a moment 
                         - until the noise dies completely. Now

                         The occupants brace themselves for the 
                         jolt. The ship hits and bounces several 
                         times and finally stops. Its nose seems 
                         to bury itself in the ground. The people 
                         are lifted high into the air where they 
                         remain, suspended for a few seconds, 
                         terror-stricken. Then, accompanied by 
                         grinding, crackling sounds, the ship 
                         flops back and falls on its side. For 
                         a moment there is stark silence - while 
                         the people do not stir. A look of relief 
                         spreads over their faces.

                         "Okay - yeah - I think so." Meanwhile, 
                         Conway has opened the door. A swirling 
                         mass of snow greets them, so that they 
                         have to force their way out.

                         from the plane in the blinding snow. 
                         George quickly runs around to the other 
                         side. Conway crosses to the cockpit, 
                         and clambers aboard.

                         Hello - what's this? A map!

                         He resumes his search enthusiastically. 
                         Suddenly he stops. The utter limpness 
                         of the pilot's body gives him pause. 
                         He lifts up his chin, stares into his 
                         face - pulls up his eyelid and then 
                         places a hand over his heart. He turns 
                         slowly toward George, who has been watching 
                         his brother intently.

                         He's dead.
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Dead?
                                     
                         George stares unbelievingly.
                                     
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         It must have happened the moment he 
                         hit the ground.
                                      
                         (a pause)
                                     
                         Let's take a look at this map.
                                     
                         Conway holds the map under the dashboard 
                         light. He studies it painstakingly, 
                         and his tense expression changes to 
                         one of deep concern. George's eyes are 
                         glued on him.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         What is it?
                                     
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         See that spot?
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Yes.
                                     
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         That's where we were this morning. He 
                         had it marked. Right on the border of 
                         Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. 
                         We must be a thousand miles beyond it 
                         - just a blank on the map.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         (afraid to ask)
                                     
                         What's it mean?
                                     
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         It means we're in unexplored country 
                         - country nobody ever reached.
                                      
                         George stares at him, wide-eyed, the 
                         gravity of their situation slowly penetrating 
                         his terrorized mind. Conway's thoughts 
                         are interrupted by a knock on the panel, 
                         and he looks up.

                         We see the faces of Barnard and the 
                         others. We hear their voices inquiring 
                         - "Hey, Conway, what's happening?" - 
                         "What's up?" - "Where are we?" - "What'd 
                         you find out?"

                         Conway turns to George.
                                     
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         George, our chances of getting out of 
                         this are pretty slim. But it's up to 
                         us.
                                      
                         (a nod toward cabin)

                         He enters the cabin through the cockpit.

                         As Conway enters, he is met by a volley 
                         of questions.

                         Everything's all right. The pilot won't 
                         trouble us any more. He's - he's dead.
 
                                                              
                         This is met by a series of exclamations.

                         the morning.

                         Taking in George as he enters from cockpit. 
                         His terror-stricken eyes look dully 
                         before him. He stops in the doorway.

                         The storm will probably die down by 
                         then. My suggestion is that we better 
                         all try and get a good night's rest.

                         and Lovett as they face Conway, who 
                         sits down.

                         They all wheel around and face George.
 
                                                              
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Why don't you tell them we're a million 
                         miles from civilization, without a chance 
                         of getting out of here alive? It's slow 
                         starvation - that's what it is. It's 
                         a slow, horrible death!
                                      
                         When the significance of this outburst 
                         finally sinks into the chaotic minds 
                         of his listeners, they turn to Conway 
                         hopefully, certain he will refute it. 
                         But Conway looks beyond them at George. 
                         From his noncommittal silence, they 
                         realize that George's statement is the 
                         truth. They slip into their seats. The 
                         place is heavy with a fatalistic silence. 
                         George slowly crosses to his seat near 
                         Conway, avoiding his accusing eyes. 
                         Suddenly the air is rent with harsh, 
                         bitter laughter from Gloria. They all 
                         look up.

                         to get out of watching you squirm for 
                         a change.
                                      
                         (her voice cracks completely)
                                     
                         What a kick!
                                     
                         She flops into her seat and buries her 
                         head in her hands. For quite a while 
                         all we hear are her stifled sobs.

                         George throws sidelong glances at his 
                         brother, feeling his guilt.

                         Shooting from front of plane, taking 
                         in entire cabin. The only sound that 
                         comes in on the tragic quiet is the 
                         low moaning of the wind outside. A feeling 
                         of doom has descended upon the five 
                         people.

                         Shooting toward the mountains which 
                         seem to imprison the valley below. The 
                         snowstorm, treacherous in its fury, 
                         seems to threaten the valley with complete 
                         obliteration.

                         Of the plane, tilted over on its side. 
                         It is fully covered with snow. CAMERA 
                         PANS UP TO LOVETT AND BARNARD, shivering 
                         in their blankets as they pace worriedly.

                         George and Conway are missing. Lovett 
                         turns from the window.
                                      
                         LOVETT
                                     
                         They've been gone for three hours.
 
                                                              
                         The others appear disinterested in this 
                         observation.

                         Left us here to rot. That's what they've 
                         done. Heroes of the newspapers!

                         Lovett sees something through the window.

                         George and Conway are seen walking briskly 
                         toward the plane, their few clothes 
                         a scant protection against the biting 
                         wind.

                         LOVETT
                                     
                         Here they come!
                                     
                         The others quickly glance up, just as 
                         Conway and George clamber aboard. Conway 
                         has a serious mien, but George is full 
                         of vigor and enthusiasm.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Hello, everybody.
                                     
                         He holds out his hat which he has been 
                         carrying, bottom side up.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Well, we found some food.
                                     
                         Barnard and Lovett rush to him.
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         No chance of our starving now.
                                     
                         When they see the contents of his hat, 
                         their faces fall.
                                      
                         LOVETT
                                     
                         What is it?
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, 
                         have some. I've read of people lasting 
                         thirty days on this stuff.
                                      
                         They grab handfuls. He goes on:
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Listen, my brother and I have worked 
                         out a plan. If we use our heads, we 
                         should be able to keep alive for weeks, 
                         until he gets back.
                                      
                         LOVETT & BARNARD
                                     
                         Gets back? Where's he going?
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         He doesn't know. But he's starting out 
                         right away in the direction of India. 
                         Sooner or later he's bound to run into 
                         somebody - a tribe or something.
                                      
                         BARNARD
                                     
                         Yeah?

                         Throughout the previous scene he has 
                         been busily occupied making preparations. 
                         Out of the baggage hold he has brought 
                         some blankets and rope and has been 
                         wrapping his feet in them. As George 
                         speaks, he looks up and smiles.

                         Now here's the idea. We found a cave 
                         over by that small hill. After we bury 
                         the pilot, we're moving in. We can have 
                         a fire there. I shouldn't be surprised 
                         to see Bob back within a week.
                                      
                         Conway's smile dies on his face. We 
                         get a feeling he is attempting a futile 
                         journey, and is fully aware of it. He 
                         resumes the roping of his feet - his 
                         movements mechanical.

                         Barnard peers out the plane window.

                         appearing over the top of a hill, we 
                         see a caravan of natives approaching. 
                         They are not close enough to distinguish 
                         who or what they are, but that they

                         Conway takes in the unbelievable sight. 
                         We hear the exultant exclamations of 
                         the others. Barnard and Lovett start

                         fur, hats and boots. Somewhere in the

                         an elderly Chinese. Chang steps forward 
                         as their leader.

                         and bowing courteously, greets him in 
                         Chinese. Chang turns his head slowly 
                         and speaks in perfect Oxfordian English.

                         Of the group. They round a curve and 
                         come upon a narrow crevice which opens 
                         up into a passageway. One by one they 
                         step through, assisted by the natives. 
                         On the other side, they sigh relievedly. 
                         Oddly, the wind has stopped, the chill 
                         has lessened. They look up to inspect 
                         their surroundings and a startled look 
                         comes into their eyes.

                         What he sees leaves him transfixed. 
                         He stares unbelievingly before him for 
                         a long time.

                         A sight that is both magnificent and 
                         incredible. The eye-filling horizon 
                         before them throws out a softness and 
                         a warmth that is breathless. On the 
                         left is a group of colored pavilions 
                         that seem as if suspended on the mountainside. 
                         Down below, in the hazy distance, is 
                         a valley which gives one the impression 
                         of a huge tapestry, superb in its blending 
                         of soft colors. In every direction, 
                         wherever one might gaze, there is a 
                         feast of strange and heavenly beauty.

                         Conway's group and Chang. Chang smiles 
                         as he watches their astonished faces. 
                         Conway turns from the rare magnificence 
                         of Shangri-La, unhampered by the wind 
                         and storm they had just encountered, 
                         and looks backward, in the direction 
                         from which they came to assure himself 
                         he is the victim of a nightmare. Chang, 
                         watching him, answers him before he 
                         can express his astonishment.

                         (a wave of his hand)
                                     
                         You see, we are sheltered by mountains 
                         on every side. A strange phenomena for 
                         which we are very grateful.

                         Following Conway's gaze. In an upper 
                         window of a tower, their faces glued 
                         to the pane, are two robed Lamas who 
                         stare down curiously. CAMERA PANS OVER 
                         to a very narrow terrace covered almost 
                         completely by a floral arbor. In it 
                         stands a statuesque woman of rare beauty. 
                         She looks down at Conway intently.

                         It suggests nothing we might expect 
                         to see in this forsaken place. The motif 
                         is neither Oriental nor religious - 
                         but rather a delicately appointed room, 
                         subdued in tones. At the moment, no 
                         one is present except servants who silently 
                         set the table.

                         Of Lovett peering worriedly toward dining 
                         room door. He sees two servants who 
                         flank the entrance and steps back hesitantly. 
                         Barnard emerges from a room across the 
                         hall, and Lovett beckons to him. Both 
                         are attired in flowing robes not unlike 
                         the one worn by Chang.

                         to wear.

                         they're going to give them back to us,

                         They have reached the doorway of the

                         It is in semi-darkness. The moon sends 
                         a stream of light through the windows. 
                         Outside we see the outline of towering 
                         mountains. Spread across the bed - her 
                         clothes unchanged - is the body of Gloria 
                         - her face sunk deep in the pillows.

                         Gloria emits wracking coughs. After 
                         a few moments - she sits up. Her cheeks 
                         are wet - her hair disheveled - her 
                         eyes bloodshot. We get an impression 
                         of someone who has suffered for hours. 
                         Finally, her coughing begins again - 
                         and unable to stand it, she rises and 
                         paces the floor - then she crosses to 
                         the window and looks down, CAMERA PANNING 
                         WITH HER - and into her eyes has come 
                         a grim, determined expression.

                         She is staring at the chasm below her.

                         here in the valley.

                         us, we're very anxious to discuss ways 
                         and means of getting back home.

                         The first thing we want to do is to 
                         cable the Foreign Office. All of England 
                         is waiting to hear about my brother. 
                         There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready 
                         to take him back.

                         Really? Well, as regards cabling, I'm 
                         afraid I can't help. Unfortunately, 
                         we have no wireless here. As a matter 
                         of fact, we have no means of communication 
                         with the outside world.
                                      
                         George stares at him suspiciously - 
                         and then turns to Conway for his reaction 
                         - but Conway is apparently disinterested 
                         in the whole conversation.

                         It's always been a source of deep regret, 
                         but the mountains surrounding us have 
                         made reception almost impossible.

                         In that event, we better make arrangements 
                         to get some porters immediately. Some 
                         means to get us back to civilization.

                         too vague.

                         We didn't get much information out of 
                         him, did we Bob?

                         It seems to me we should be grateful. 
                         We were in a bad mess this morning.

                         After all, this is quite pleasant. Why 
                         not make ourselves comfortable until 
                         the porters do arrive?
                                      
                         While he was speaking, the muted strains 
                         of a violin float into the room. Conway 
                         rises.

                         a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards 
                         in the other room.

                         He disappears onto the balcony. George 
                         watches him go.

                         double solitaire.

                         Lovett detests the pet names, but follows. 
                         George thinks a moment - and crosses 
                         to balcony.

                         Conway is listening moodily to the soulful

                         did those clothes materialize so conveniently 
                         when they met us at the plane? Chang 
                         himself just said that they never venture 
                         beyond that point. What brought them 
                         there? Unless it was to meet us?

                         Chang's first question was about the 
                         pilot.

                         There must be some connection between 
                         the plane and this place. They must 
                         have deliberately brought us here. Why, 
                         Bob? What reason could they have for 
                         doing a thing like that?

                         To put it simply, I should say that 
                         our general belief was in moderation. 
                         We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses 
                         of every kind, even including—

                         Why, we have no crime here. What makes 
                         a criminal? Lack, usually. Avariciousness, 
                         envy, the desire to possess something 
                         owned by another. There can be no crime 
                         where there is a sufficiency of everything.

                         Chang smiles. Conway scarcely hears 
                         the last speech, for his attention has 
                         been caught by the playing of a piano. 
                         He stops to listen. Chang has walked 
                         out of scene.

                         Conway locates the direction whence 
                         the music comes, goes to a doorway where 
                         he stops.

                         He realizes Conway did not follow him 
                         and turns. When he sees Conway, his 
                         face clouds - and he starts toward him.

                         Conway watches someone through door

                         room, oddly shaped, and except for a 
                         piano, a harp and several chairs, is 
                         otherwise sparsely furnished. At the 
                         extreme end, the room is set off by 
                         an alcove of stained glass extending 
                         from the ceiling to the floor, where 
                         it finishes with a deep window seat. 
                         At the piano we see an old man - and 
                         by his side is the girl Conway saw last 
                         night. They finish playing and both

                         sees Conway, off scene, and her face 
                         sobers - self-consciously.

                         Conway turns for one last glimpse of 
                         the girl, and then turns to Chang, looking 
                         up at his face, puzzled and amused.

                         A Belgian priest by the name of Father 
                         Perrault, the first European to find 
                         this place, and a very great man indeed. 
                         He is responsible for everything you 
                         see here. He built Shangri-La, taught 
                         our natives, and began our collection 
                         of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father 
                         Perrault.

                         Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I 
                         think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled 
                         into the Valley, half frozen to death. 
                         It was typical of the man that, one 
                         leg being frozen, and of course there 
                         being no doctors here, he amputated 
                         the leg himself.

                         Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had 
                         learned to understand their language, 
                         the natives told him he could have saved 
                         his leg. It would have healed without 
                         amputation.

                         Yes, yes. They were very sincere about 
                         it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect 
                         health is the rule here. They've never

                         be true for anyone else living here.

                         Do you know when he and the natives

                         Forgive me. I should have told you it 
                         is quite common here to live to a very 
                         ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain 
                         water, you might say. But we like to 
                         believe it is the absence of struggle 
                         in the way we live. In your countries, 
                         on the other hand, how often do you 
                         hear the expression, "He worried himself 
                         to death?" or, "This thing or that killed 
                         him?"

                         as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural 
                         death as by indirect suicide.

                         and gives a start. Then, chuckling to

                         warily and continues to write.

                         It is a bright, cheery morning. Conway 
                         is drinking in the beauty of his surroundings. 
                         He comes into the area where the horses 
                         are stabled. Two men are busily grooming 
                         the horses.

                         Would you like to take a ride, Mr. Conway?

                         Suddenly, Conway is startled by the 
                         sound of hoof-beats and, looking up, 
                         is in time to see 'the girl' of the 
                         previous sequence (Sondra) fly by him 
                         on a horse - screaming delightedly. 
                         As she passes him, she waves.

                         Sondra whizzes by. As we stay on the

                         pursuit.

                         Showing Sondra disappearing behind a 
                         mountain waterfall. Conway dashes up, 
                         but she is lost from sight. He wheels 
                         around several times - and unable to 
                         find her, looks puzzled. Finally, giving 
                         up, he starts slowly back. After a few 
                         moments he is startled by her laughter, 
                         and glances around.

                         From his view - shooting upward. High 
                         up - near the summit of the hill - we 
                         see Sondra - waving and laughing. Then 
                         she swings her horse around and disappears.

                         As she swims in a mountain stream, apparently 
                         in the buff. From a distance, we see

                         He has caught up to her tethered horse 
                         and is skulking around trying to find 
                         out where she is.

                         A squirrel, near to Sondra, chatters 
                         excitedly.

                         She can apparently understand the squirrel's 
                         warning. She hurries to dive back into 
                         the water and swim to the other side. 
                         She comes up, spots Conway and watches 
                         him from hiding, behind some bushes.

                         Conway has discovered her clothing and 
                         is constructing a kind of scarecrow 
                         on a bush out of them. As a crowning 
                         touch, he adds a flower to the effigy, 
                         his eyes twinkling at his little joke. 
                         With one final glance over his shoulder, 
                         he turns to leave.

                         George comes out of door to dining room

                         in a cheerful mood, singing as he goes, 
                         a Cockney song.

                         wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.

                         Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two 
                         weeks and we haven't found out a thing.

                         I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.

                         Barnard laughs heartily. George, surily 
                         silent, enters and drops in his seat. 
                         At the same moment, Gloria comes into 
                         the room.

                         for 20 years teaching school, and now 
                         I couldn't sell it for postage stamps.

                         That's too bad. I got a half million 
                         shares. My whole foundation! And now 
                         look at me!

                         A colossal nerve you have sitting there 
                         and talking about it so calmly - you, 
                         the swindler of thousands of people—

                         thing so funny. A guy like me starts 
                         out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, 
                         everyday, slew-footed[12] plumber - 
                         and by the use of a little brains, mind 
                         you, he builds up a gigantic institution, 
                         employs thousands of people, becomes 
                         a great civic leader. And then the crash 
                         comes - and overnight he's the biggest 
                         crook the country ever had.

                         The sharpness of his voice startles 
                         the others.

                         to get back? You may not know it, but 
                         you're all prisoners here. We were deliberately 
                         kidnapped and brought here - and nobody 
                         knows why—
                                      
                         He rises to his feet.

                         Well, I'm not content to be a prisoner. 
                         I'm going to find out when we're going 
                         to get out of this place.

                         Before anybody can realize what his 
                         intentions are, he has bolted out of 
                         the room.

                         As George strides determinedly out into 
                         the hall, yelling.

                         Suddenly he sees a native servant and 
                         his eyes pop insanely. CAMERA PANS WITH 
                         HIM as he strides across to the servant 
                         and grabs him by the shirt-front.

                         Conway has caught up with him and wrestles 
                         him away from the servant, who stumbles 
                         off in fright.

                         George pushes Conway away from him and 
                         starts down the corridor.

                         George spies another servant.

                         The servant, frightened by his voice, 
                         turns suddenly and starts running. George 
                         levels his revolver and sends a stream 
                         of bullets after the fleeing servant, 
                         who miraculously manages to skate around 
                         a corner, unharmed. Conway runs into 
                         scene, reaching George, and with a quick 
                         flip of his left hand he smacks him 
                         over his revolver arm - and with his 
                         right, he punches him flush on the jaw.

                         down at him, deeply concerned. After

                         Chang enters scene, beaming charmingly.

                         As Chang enters. He bows courteously 
                         to the others, who stand in front of 
                         George's bed. Conway shuts the door 
                         and turns the key. He crosses to a door 
                         leading to another room - and locks 
                         this one, also. Chang watches him curiously. 
                         The others, including George, who is 
                         now alert, are puzzled and somewhat 
                         impressed. Then Conway comes to Chang.

                         Won't you sit down?
                                     
                         Chang sits, his placidity unchanged. 
                         Conway pulls up a chair in front of 
                         him.

                         Mr. Chang, you have been very kind to 
                         us - and we appreciate it. But for some 
                         reason we are being held prisoners here, 
                         and we want to know why.

                         As Conway's voice continues, talking 
                         to Chang:
                                      
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         Personally, I don't mind at all. I'm 
                         enjoying every minute of it.
                                      
                         (dead serious)
                                     
                         But my brother is not of the same opinion, 
                         nor are the others.
                                      
                         (after a pause)
                                     
                         It's time we were told what it's all 
                         about.

                         Conway still continuing:

                         We want to know why we were kidnapped, 
                         why we are being kept here, but most 
                         important of all - do we get the porters, 
                         and when?
                                      
                         (much too suavely)
                                     
                         Until we get this information, my dear 
                         Mr. Chang, I am very much afraid we 
                         cannot permit you to leave this room.
 
                                                              
                         There is a pause while the eyes of all 
                         are centered on Chang's face.

                         You know, it's very, very strange, but 
                         when you saw me in the corridor, I was

                         a high state of expectancy. Conway is 
                         grim. They climb a narrow spiral staircase.

                         They proceed up the stairs until they 
                         arrive at a large, impressively ornate 
                         double door which seems to open automatically 
                         the moment they approach. Chang remains 
                         without. The moment Conway steps over 
                         the threshold, the doors swing closed.

                         As the doors swing shut. Conway turns 
                         and realizes Chang is no longer with 
                         him.

                         Conway stands still, glancing around 
                         the room, which is lit so dimly that 
                         nothing definite is distinguishable.

                         To show what Conway sees. For the moment, 
                         practically nothing. As his eyes become 
                         adjusted to the darkness, he begins 
                         to sense the architecture and furnishings 
                         of the room. But as yet no sign of life. 
                         SLOW PAN SHOT reveals it to be a dark-curtained 
                         and low-ceilinged room, furnished rather 
                         simply. Very sombre, indistinct tapestries 
                         drape the back walls. While the CAMERA 
                         FOLLOWS CONWAY'S GAZE, MOVING SLOWLY 
                         AROUND, a voice is heard.

                         Good evening, Mr. Conway.
                                     
                         CAMERA QUICKLY SWINGS OVER to the nethermost 
                         corner of the room where, scarcely visible, 
                         sits an old man of indeterminate age. 
                         In the gloom only the outlines of his 
                         pale and wrinkled face can be seen.

                         stands within a few feet of the old

                         As Conway, expressionless, sits down 
                         opposite the High Lama.

                         Personally, I've enjoyed your community 
                         very much. But my friends do not care 
                         for this mystery. They are determined 
                         to leave as soon as—
                                      
                         While he has been speaking, his eyes 
                         have been gradually taking in the details 
                         of the old man. The CAMERA QUICKLY FOLLOWS 
                         HIS GAZE - to crutches leaning against 
                         the man's throne - then, looking down, 
                         to his legs, one of which appears to 
                         have been amputated.

                         You may not know it, but I've been an 
                         admirer of yours for a great many years.
 
                                                              
                         Conway evinces surprise.

                         Oh, not of Conway the empire-builder 
                         and public hero. I wanted to meet the 
                         Conway who in one of his books, said, 
                         "There are moments in every man's life 
                         when he glimpses the eternal."
                                      
                         The quotation captures Conway's interest 
                         - and his eyes widen.

                         That Conway seemed to belong here. In 
                         fact, it was suggested that someone 
                         be sent to bring him here.

                         brilliant idea?

                         Of course I have suspected that our 
                         being here is no accident. Furthermore, 
                         I have a feeling that we're never supposed 
                         to leave. But that, for the moment, 
                         doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet 
                         that when it comes. What particularly 
                         interests me at present is, why was 
                         I brought here? What possible use can 
                         I be to an already thriving community?

                         We need men like you here, to be sure 
                         that our community will continue to 
                         thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La 
                         has much to give you. You are still, 
                         by the world's standards, a youngish 
                         man. Yet in the normal course of existence, 
                         you can expect twenty or thirty years 
                         of gradually diminishing activity. Here, 
                         however, in Shangri-La, by our standards 
                         your life has just begun, and may go 
                         on and on.

                         But to be candid, Father, a prolonged 
                         future doesn't excite me. It would have 
                         to have a point. I've sometimes doubted 
                         whether life itself has any. And if 
                         that is so, then long life must be even 
                         more pointless. No, I'd need a much 
                         more definite reason for going on and 
                         on.

                         We have reason. It is the entire meaning 
                         and purpose of Shangri-La. It came to 
                         me in a vision, long, long, ago. I saw 
                         all the nations strengthening, not in 
                         wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and 
                         the will to destroy. I saw their machine 
                         power multiply until a single weaponed 
                         man might match a whole army. I foresaw 
                         a time when man, exulting in the technique 
                         of murder, would rage so hotly over 
                         the world that every book, every treasure, 
                         would be doomed to destruction. This 
                         vision was so vivid and so moving that 
                         I determined to gather together all 
                         the things of beauty and culture that 
                         I could and preserve them here against 
                         the doom toward which the world is rushing.
 
                                                              
                         (pause)
                                     
                         Look at the world today! Is there anything 
                         more pitiful? What madness there is, 
                         what blindness, what unintelligent leadership! 
                         A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity 
                         crashing headlong against each other, 
                         propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality. 
                         The time must come, my friend, when 
                         this orgy will spend itself, when brutality 
                         and the lust for power must perish by 
                         its own sword. Against that time is 
                         why I avoided death and am here, and 
                         why you were brought here. For when 
                         that day comes, the world must begin 
                         to look for a new life. And it is our 
                         hope that they may find it here. For 
                         here we shall be with their books

                         and their music and a way of life based 
                         on one simple rule: Be Kind.

                         that the brotherly love of Shangri-La 
                         will spread throughout the world.

                         Yes, my son, when the strong have devoured 
                         each other, the Christian ethic may 
                         at last be fulfilled, and the meek shall

                         so engrossed is he in all he has just 
                         heard, scarcely notices the Lama, who 
                         has risen slowly and now stands before 
                         him. The Lama reaches down and gently 
                         touches him on the shoulder.

                         (scarcely audible)
                                     
                         I understand you, Father.
                                     
                         Conway kisses the High Lama's hand.
 
                                                              
                         HIGH LAMA
                                     
                         You must come again, my son. Good night.
 
                                                              
                         Conway slowly rises to his feet and 
                         turns to leave scene.

                         Conway comes through. He walks as if 
                         in a trance. CAMERA PULLS BACK as he 
                         continues on his way - bearing an expression 
                         of deep absorption.

                         As Conway walks toward an open door 
                         at the end of corridor leading to the 
                         garden. Lovett emerges from one of the 
                         rooms and sees him. He beckons to those 
                         inside and almost immediately they come 
                         out and start toward Conway.

                         Conway stares at them blankly.

                         We see Conway walk through the garden 
                         in b.g. and disappear.

                         the pastoral beauty.

                         As he walks along. He comes to a spot 
                         where a man and a woman are tilling 
                         the soil, and stops to watch them. The 
                         man looks up and, seeing Conway, makes 
                         a friendly bow and doffs his hat. Conway 
                         also bows. The woman curtsies prettily 
                         and smiles. Conway doffs his hat in 
                         acknowledgement.
                                      
                         He is in a cheerful frame of mind and 
                         continues his walk - CAMERA CONTINUING 
                         WITH HIM. He greets several other people. 
                         Upon seeing him, they also bow and doff 
                         their hats. Conway does likewise.

                         Conway is walking along a street in 
                         the valley. It is a quaint thoroughfare, 
                         unlike anything we have ever seen before. 
                         The small, one-story huts along its 
                         very narrow sidewalk are of singularly 
                         varied architecture - giving the impression 
                         of being "homemade." As a result of 
                         this, no two are alike. Only one characteristic 
                         about them is similar - their cleanliness. 
                         Something about the atmosphere is fresh 
                         and wholesome and peaceful. In front 
                         of several of the huts native women 
                         sit - some weaving on a tapestry board, 
                         some nursing babies, some asleep, and 
                         some just sitting. The keynote is contentment.

                         With Conway, walking along. As he passes, 
                         the women smile at him in the most friendly 
                         fashion. From inside these homes, soft 
                         and soothing music emanates. At the 
                         end of the street, Conway finally arrives 
                         at a garden spot. The suddenness of 
                         this is startling, too - because of 
                         its beauty. Sighing contentedly, Conway 
                         throws himself at the foot of an overhanging 
                         tree, and leans against the trunk.

                         He throws his head back, shuts his eyes 
                         - in a restful and contemplative mood. 
                         He remains this way quietly for a few 
                         seconds, when he is attracted by the 
                         singing of a chorus of children's voices. 
                         He glances around.

                         From Conway's angle. In the shadow of 
                         a row of overhanging trees which form 
                         an arch, a group of fifteen or twenty 
                         children sing a hymn, or nursery song 
                         - in English. Sondra (the violin girl 
                         of previous scenes) stands in front 
                         of them, a baton in hand, conducting 
                         them.

                         He smiles at the sight - and springing 
                         to his feet starts in their direction.

                         Of Sondra and the children, as Conway 
                         saunters into the scene behind her. 
                         He finds himself a comfortable place 
                         under a tree and sits down. The children, 
                         still singing, have seen his approach 
                         and crane their necks curiously.

                         She waves her baton and sings with the 
                         children. Then she notices they are 
                         being distracted and casually turns 
                         her head. She is somewhat startled at 
                         seeing Conway, but quickly recovers 
                         her composure, and smiles wanly.

                         He smiles also.

                         To include Sondra, Conway and some of 
                         the children. They finish the song, 
                         and Conway applauds. Sondra curtsies 
                         prettily. She turns to the children.

                         Good morning, Mr. Conway.

                         Conway scrambles to his feet and does 
                         an exaggerated bow. Sondra laughs delightedly.

                         She lifts her baton and the thin, piping 
                         voices fill the air.

                         He lights a cigarette and, leaning against 
                         a tree, studies Sondra's face - impressed 
                         by her beauty.

                         She slyly glances backward, and a self-conscious 
                         smile covers her face.

                         As a child from the ranks breaks and 
                         comes to Sondra, who leans down to listen 
                         to the child - who whispers in her ear. 
                         Sondra, murmuring, "Of course, dear" 
                         and still waving her baton is, for the 
                         moment, uncertain what to do. Then turning 
                         to Conway, holds out the baton to him.

                         Conway snaps out of his reverie and 
                         jumps forward.

                         He takes the baton from her.

                         And, taking the child by the hand, she 
                         exits.

                         Conducting the chorus in all seriousness 
                         - albeit a trifle awkwardly. He turns 
                         his head to watch Sondra, and when he 
                         looks forward again, finds himself off-beat. 
                         To cover his embarrassment, he smiles 
                         foolishly.

                         They come to the end of the song, but 
                         Conway, whose eyes are searching for 
                         Sondra, is oblivious of this and continues 
                         to conduct mechanically. The children 
                         break into laughter.

                         With Sondra as she returns with the 
                         child clinging to her. As she turns 
                         a bend, she looks up, surprised.

                         As she laughs heartily.

                         The children break into squeals and 
                         race off. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM as 
                         they cross a footbridge, gleefully doff 
                         their clothes and with yelps and cries 
                         leap into a stream.

                         Of a large coop where pigeons are bred 
                         and raised. The pigeons flutter around, 
                         landing on Sondra and Conway, as she 
                         shows him her collection with pride. 
                         She grabs one pigeon and ties one of 
                         the miniature flutes to its legs.

                         And by varying the size of the flutes, 
                         I can get any notes I wish. The wind 
                         does the rest. Here's a little fellow

                         full of that. But you were accomplishing 
                         nothing. You were going nowhere, and 
                         you knew it.

                         Do you realize that there is a British 
                         cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring 
                         out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings,

                         Well, I was almost born here. It took 
                         place in that wild country beyond the 
                         pass. My father and mother were in a 
                         party of explorers who got lost and 
                         wandered around for a year. When Chang 
                         found us, only Father and I were alive. 
                         But he was too weak to climb the pass. 
                         He died on the way. I was brought up 
                         here by Father Perrault himself.

                         Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked 
                         to him last night.

                         light. But why do I confuse you? Am 
                         I so strange?

                         And that in itself is confusing. I have 
                         the same idea about Shangri-La. The 
                         sense that I've been here before, that 
                         I belong here.

                         rooted in the good earth of this fertile 
                         valley, while its head explores the

                         yet I accept it amiably, with the same

                         world. But I understand there are millions 
                         and millions of people who are supposed 
                         to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know 
                         that secretly they are all hoping to 
                         find a garden spot where there is peace 
                         and security, where there's beauty and 
                         comfort, where they wouldn't have to 
                         be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish 
                         the whole world might come to this valley.

                         Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for 
                         long.
                                      
                         She laughs as they exit scene.

                         Barnard is bringing a reluctant Lovett 
                         along on an excursion into the Valley. 
                         They pass friendly natives and farmers 
                         at work.

                         I don't know why I associate with you, 
                         Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant

                         name may be.

                         Barney? Why should I? Never! We have 
                         nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What 
                         effrontery!

                         And this trip to the valley. I can't 
                         imagine why I'd allow you to drag me 
                         down here. Why, we don't know anything 
                         about these people. We're not even armed!

                         they've got horns.

                         Lovett sees his point, starts to chuckle, 
                         but still looks wary.

                         a glass of water. Look here, I've got

                         roared, "And somebody's been sleeping

                         about it, it certainly doesn't sound 
                         very attractive.

                         catches up with her. He reaches to place

                         I was fascinated by the way its shadow 
                         followed it. That silly shadow racing 
                         along over mountains and valleys, covering 
                         ten times the distance of the plane. 
                         It was always there to greet us with 
                         outstretched arms when we landed. And 
                         I've been thinking that somehow you're 
                         that plane, and I'm that silly shadow.

                         and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing 
                         over obstacles, never dreaming that 
                         one day that beautiful thing in flight

                         permission of course, and while I'm 
                         waiting for these porters, I would like 
                         to organize classes for those children

                         practical and something useful. Geology.

                         I thought Mr. Conway's brother was here. 
                         Excuse me.
                                      
                         She leaves.

                         Young? She arrived here in 1888. She 
                         was 20 at the time. She was on her way 
                         to join her betrothed - when her carriers 
                         lost their way in the mountains. The 
                         whole party would have perished but 
                         for meeting some of our people.

                         Amazing! She still doesn't look over 
                         20. When is she likely to grow old in 
                         appearance?

                         a pack of lies you told us about those 
                         porters! Of course the minute they arrive, 
                         we can make arrangements to leave. If 
                         they take us. But you knew very well 
                         you'd tell them not to!

                         You've been lying to us ever since we 
                         got here! Apparently it's worked with 
                         some people. Perhaps it's because they 
                         lack the courage to do anything about 
                         it. But not me, Chang. You're up against 
                         the wrong man. I'll get out of here, 
                         if I have to blow this fantastic place 
                         into the valley! I'll get out—porters

                         the journey. He could never get through 
                         that country alive.

                         HIGH LAMA
                                     
                         You, my son, will live through the storm. 
                         You will preserve the fragrance of our 
                         history, and add to it a touch of your 
                         own mind. Beyond that, my vision weakens.
 
                                                              
                         (pause - magisterially)
                                     
                         But I see in the great distance a new 
                         world starting in the ruins - stirring 
                         clumsily - but in hopefulness, seeking 
                         its vast and legendary treasures. And 
                         they will all be here, my son, hidden 
                         behind the mountains in the Valley of 
                         the Blue Moon, preserved as if by a 
                         miracle.
                                      
                         The voice of the Lama, toward the last, 
                         seems to fade out. Conway, thoroughly 
                         engrossed, half-consciously waits for 
                         it to continue. Following a protracted 
                         silence, he slowly turns toward the 
                         Lama. A breeze blows through the room, 
                         ruffling curtains on the window.
                                      
                         277. CLOSE SHOT - THE HIGH LAMA
                                     
                         From whose face the glow has faded. 
                         There is nothing left but a dark-shadowed 
                         mask.
                                      
                         278. CLOSEUP - CONWAY
                                     
                         He stares, uncertainly, for a long while, 
                         with a slow realization that the High 
                         Lama is dead. Quite unaware that he 
                         is being moved emotionally, tears well 
                         up in his eyes. While still sitting 
                         this way, unable to stir, he becomes 
                         conscious of activity around him.

                         As two servants, unbeckoned, arrive 
                         - only to peer, solemn-faced, at the 
                         Lama. Then, in intervals of seconds, 
                         groups of Lamas, hitherto unseen, enter 
                         softly and silently, and gather around 
                         the High Lama. We hear indistinguishable 
                         murmurs that might or might not be prayers. 
                         Conway is only vaguely aware of their 
                         presence - and after a few moments, 
                         scarcely conscious of what is actuating 
                         his movements, he drifts away from the 
                         murmuring Lamas, and walks in the direction 
                         of the door.

                         Barnard and Gloria are on their knees 
                         on the floor. Before them they have 
                         spread a large map or chart. Barnard 
                         is enthusiastically out - lining his 
                         plans.

                         Look, honey. We run the pipes through 
                         here, and we connect with the main water 
                         line here.

                         Oh, that's a cinch. I'll show them how 
                         to cast pipes out of clay.
                                      
                         This is as far as they get for George

                         get your things together. We're leaving.

                         Yes. I've just been talking with the 
                         porters. They're going to take us. We've 
                         got clothing, food, everything. Come 
                         on!

                         Right this very minute! The porters 
                         are waiting for us on the plateau. And 
                         that Chinaman thought he could stop 
                         me. Come along.

                         I think I'll stick around. I'll leave 
                         with the porters on their next trip.

                         Yes.

                         Lovett immediately dismisses George 
                         from his mind and his face brightening, 
                         he starts toward Barnard and Gloria.

                         Barney, I've just finished translating 
                         one of the most interesting old tablets 
                         you can imagine. It told me all about 
                         the origin of the Masonic symbols and—

                         That's swell, Lovey. I want to show 
                         you something. Look!
                                      
                         He proudly displays his map.

                         As all three heads go into a huddle.

                         Conway stands in front of a window - 
                         his arms extended across - peering out 
                         moodily. He is watching a solemn and 
                         slow-moving procession of torchlight-bearers 
                         - the funeral rites of the High Lama 
                         - accompanied by cermonial music and 
                         drum-beating.

                         Shooting over his shoulder.
                                     
                         Getting his view of the magisterial 
                         procession.

                         Conway, as he thoughtfully surveys the 
                         surroundings of which he has just become 
                         master.

                         George appears in the doorway. He looks 
                         around and espies Conway. For a moment 
                         he stands uncertainly, and finally enters.

                         (softly)
                                     
                         Bob—

                         As Conway turns - and seeing him, evinces 
                         no emotion whatsoever.
                                      
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         (a murmur)
                                     
                         Hello, George.
                                     
                         George looks at him peculiarly. Conway's 
                         behavior is odd in view of their strained 
                         relationship.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Well, you can stop worrying about everything 
                         now, Bob. I've made arrangements to 
                         leave. If you'll let me close that window, 
                         I can talk to you. That noise is driving 
                         me crazy.
                                      
                         He closes the window.

                         I said we're getting out of here. Back 
                         to civilization. I made a deal with 
                         the porters. They brought in a load 
                         of books or something, and they're leaving 
                         tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for 
                         us five miles outside the valley. Come 
                         on, get your things together. Where's 
                         your top coat?

                         Why not? What's going to stop me?

                         You mustn't. You've got to stay here 
                         now.

                         What's the matter with you, Bob? You've 
                         been acting strangely ever since we 
                         came here.
                                      
                         (no response from Conway)
                                     
                         I've never seen you like this. Why can't 
                         we leave? What's stopping us?
                                      
                         Conway combats an impulse to tell him 
                         the whole story.

                         Something grand and beautiful, George. 
                         Something I've been searching for all 
                         my life. The answer to the confusion 
                         and bewilderment of a lifetime. I've 
                         found it, George, and I can't leave 
                         it. You mustn't either.

                         You're carrying around a secret that 
                         seems to be eating you up. If you'll 
                         only tell me about it.

                         I will, George. I want to tell you. 
                         I'll burst with it if I don't. It's 
                         weird and fantastical and sometimes 
                         unbelievable, but so beautiful!

                         Well, as you know, we were kidnapped 
                         and brought here . . .
                                      
                         While he is speaking, we slowly
                                     
                         DISSOLVE TO:

                         As Conway is concluding his story.

                          . . . And that's the whole story, George. 
                         He died as peacefully as the passing 
                         of a cloud's shadow. His last words 
                         to me were, "I place in your hands, 
                         my son, the future and destiny of Shangri-La." 
                         Now you know why I can't leave.
                                      
                         George listens to him intently, his 
                         face a mask of apprehension. He stares 
                         at his brother for some time and finally

                         mad.

                         that don't happen today. We're living 
                         in the twentieth century.

                         I think you've been hypnotized by a 
                         lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, 
                         I wouldn't believe it if I heard it 
                         in an English monastery. Why should 
                         I swallow it here in Tibet? How do you 
                         know the things they told you are true? 
                         Did they show you any proof?

                         I don't need any proof.

                         I knew there was a reason I hated this 
                         place. I'd give half my life to fly 
                         over it with a load of bombs just for 
                         what they've done to you. How do you 
                         know the things they told you are true? 
                         Did they show you any proof? All this 
                         talk about the Lamas being hundreds 
                         of years old. How do you know? Did you 
                         see their birth certificates?

                         I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of 
                         decrepit old men sit around and dream 
                         about reforming the world. And you, 
                         Bob Conway - two-feet-on-the-ground 
                         Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.

                         What else could it mean to me? It's 
                         obviously a lot of bunk.

                         Then you'd better go, George. This is 
                         no place for you.

                         what's waiting for you. Do you want 
                         to stay here until you're half dead? 
                         Until your mind starts corroding like 
                         the rest of them?

                         Please, George. I don't want to talk 
                         about it anymore.

                         You've got to talk about it. What about 
                         me? You said they stole that plane to 
                         bring you here. I didn't want to come. 
                         You owe me some responsibility.

                         I'm tired of owing you things. You're 
                         free to go. Go ahead.

                         I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something

                         but this is bigger, stronger if you 
                         like than brotherly love. I'm sorry,

                         Because you can't. Do you know what

                         She's a fragile thing that can only 
                         live where fragile things are loved. 
                         Take her out of this valley and she'll 
                         fade away like an echo.

                         Favoring George. He laughs hollowly. 
                         He runs his hand through his hair. He 
                         stares unbelievingly at Conway.

                         This would be funny - if it wasn't so 
                         pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over 
                         twenty!

                         I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides, 
                         she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know 
                         anyway.

                         Conway stares at him.

                         her away from this awful place. She's 
                         cried in my arms for hours, for fear 
                         I'd leave her behind. And what's more, 
                         she's made two trips to the plateau 
                         to bribe the porters - for me!

                         She rushes to George and throws her 
                         arms around him.

                         I'll die if I have to stay here another

                         this chance to go, and you're not going 
                         to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go 
                         alone. It was I who bribed the porters.

                         from the High Lama not to take anyone.

                         The High Lama? Who pays any attention 
                         to him? The porters laugh at the High 
                         Lama. All they want to know is how much 
                         gold he will give them. Well, I gave 
                         them more gold. I've been stealing it 
                         for a year. I'd do anything to get out 
                         of this place. To get away from that 
                         High Lama - the one who calls himself 
                         Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane 
                         for years!

                         near. He's punished me for every minute 
                         I've spent with George. If it weren't 
                         for him, I would have been out of here 
                         long ago, but he always stops me. Six 
                         months ago, I tried to escape and he 
                         locked me in a dark room. I nearly went 
                         crazy.

                         Look at me, Mr. Conway, do I look like 
                         an old woman? Is this the skin of an 
                         old woman? Look into my eyes and see 
                         if these are the eyes of an old woman?

                         She was kidnapped and brought here two 
                         years ago just as we were, Bob.

                         I don't believe it! I can't believe 
                         it. She's lying.
                                      
                         (wildly)
                                     
                         You're lying. You're lying! Every word 
                         you've been saying is a lie! Come on, 
                         say it!
                                      
                         He has backed her into a corner and 
                         is nearly throttling her.

                         No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What 
                         reason could I have for lying? The chances 
                         are that we'll never come out of that 
                         horrible trip alive, but I'd rather 
                         die out there in a snowstorm and be 
                         buried alive, than to stay here one 
                         more minute now.
                                      
                         Thoroughly disillusioned, Conway emits

                         head - stares blankly for a moment.

                         to make the trip. We'll have to send 
                         an expedition back after them.

                         out of the main building. The funeral

                         two men walk together, Maria behind. 
                         George is cheerful and buoyant.

                         with George.

                         You had me worried for a while. I thought

                         Conway turns his head away.

                         Showing Conway, George and Maria - accompanied 
                         by a dozen or more porters - as they 
                         approach the mountain opening where 
                         they first entered Shangri-La.

                         He hesitates at the opening, looks back 
                         one more time. His eyes show confusion 
                         and defeat. George, ahead, calls out 
                         to him to hurry.

                         opening, minutes behind. The wind howls 
                         on the other side. She cries and weeps, 
                         calling out Conway's name, but he can 
                         no longer be seen.

                         Accompanied by the porters, they trudge 
                         laboriously through snow-ridden plains.

                         clambering up a mountain-side - hoisted 
                         by ropes.

                         attempt to put up tents, which proves 
                         futile, as a raging snowstorm rips the 
                         canvas from its moorings.

                         The large group are seen lowering themselves 
                         in single file down a ledge alongside 
                         a ravine. The wind howls.

                         A mountain pass somewhere with a hailstorm 
                         swiping viciously across their faces. 
                         They edge their way pre-cautiously across 
                         a narrow ledge. Suddenly the girl loses 
                         her bearings - slips - screams - and 
                         is caught by Conway just in time to 
                         save her from falling down the side 
                         of the jagged mountain.

                         has her head down. They trudge silently. 
                         The porters are off in the distance, 
                         leaving them behind.

                         On the backs of the two men, who bend 
                         over Maria. CAMERA DRAWS BACK as they 
                         straighten up. Both stare down aghast 
                         at the girl, whom we do not see.

                         The only illumination comes from the 
                         moon. We cannot get a clear view of 
                         her face. But what we see seems to us 
                         to be small, withered and aged. She 
                         is dead. The men stare at her intently.

                         despairing. Slowly his head turns toward 
                         the cliff behind him - and his eyes 
                         become alert with an idea. His face 
                         lights up with great determination. 
                         He lets out a piteous howl, and breaks 
                         away, racing out of scene.
                                      
                         Conway turns sharply and is horrified.

                         over, falling down, down into the darkness.

                         On Conway, struggling against a cyclonic 
                         wind. He tops a rise, stumbles, falls 
                         over, and rolls down the mountainside, 
                         until finally he comes to a stop, mounded 
                         by snow. Slowly, he begins to rise and 
                         start again.

                         As the sun comes up, Conway emerges 
                         from the whiteness, feeling his way 
                         forward with a walking stick. He walks 
                         with the pain and effort of a blind 
                         man, and just as he manages to cross 
                         a bridge spanning a great chasm, the 
                         bridge collapses. He stumbles on.

                         ground.

                         Conway seemed to recover his memory. 
                         Kept talking about Shangri-La, telling 
                         a fantastic story about a place in Tibet. 
                         Insisted upon returning there at once. 
                         Locked him in room but he escaped us 
                         and jumped ship during night at Singapore. 
                         Am leaving ship myself to overtake him, 
                         as fearful of his condition. Wrote down

                         which I am forwarding. Lord Gainsford."

                         Determined! Gentlemen, in the whole 
                         course of my life, I have never encountered 
                         anything so grim. During these last 
                         ten months, that man has done the most 
                         astounding things. He learned how to 
                         fly, stole an army plane and got caught, 
                         put into jail, escaped . . . all in 
                         an amazingly short space of time. But 
                         this was only the beginning of his adventures.

                         He begged, cajoled, fought, always pushing 
                         forward to the Tibetan frontier. Everywhere 
                         I went, I heard the most amazing stories 
                         of the man's adventures. Positively 
                         astounding. Until eventually, I trailed 
                         him to the most extreme outpost in Tibet.

                         those natives for the rest of their 
                         lives. The Man Who Was Not Human, they 
                         called him. They'll never forget the 
                         devil-eyed stranger who six times tried 
                         to go over a mountain pass where no 
                         other human being dared to travel, and 
                         six times was forced back by the severest 
                         storms. They'll never forget the madman 
                         who stole their food and clothing - 
                         whom they locked up in their barracks 
                         - but who fought six of their guards 
                         to escape.

                         and shuddering at the memory. He led 
                         them the wildest chase through their 
                         own country, and finally he disappeared 
                         over that very mountain pass that they 
                         themselves dared not travel.

                         GAINSFORD
                                     
                         Gentlemen, I give you a toast. Here 
                         is my hope that Robert Conway will find 
                         his Shangri-La!
                                      
                         351. CLOSE GROUP SHOT
                                     
                         They all raise their glasses.
                                     
                         GAINSFORD
                                     
                         (softly)
                                     
                         Here is my hope that we all find our 
                         Shangri-La.
                                      
                         They are all impressed by the sincerity 
                         in his voice - and as their glasses 
                         come together - CAMERA MOVES UP TO A 
                         CLOSEUP OF THEM - and as the music starts 
                         - the picture
                                      
                         DISSOLVES TO:
                                     
                         EXT. SOMEWHERE IN TIBET - NIGHT
                                     
                         352. CLOSEUP
                                     
                         MOVING IN FRONT OF CONWAY - as he walks 
                         forward with a steady step - his head 
                         held high - his eyes sparkling - snow 
                         pelting his face.
                                      
                         353. LONG SHOT
                                     
                         Over his silhouetted back.
                                     
                         As he walks away from the CAMERA, and 
                         we STAY WITH HIM a long time as he approaches 
                         a hill.
                                      
                         DISSOLVE TO:
                                     
                         354. ANOTHER LONG SHOT
                                     
                         He has now ascended to the middle of 
                         the steep hill - his gait unchanged. 
                         THE CAMERA PANS UP to the summit of 
                         the incline - and we see that beyond 
                         it the horizon is filled with a strange 
                         warm light. Conway's figure - in silhouette 
                         - disappears over the hill - bells ring 
                         - and as the music begins to swell[16]
 
                                                              
                         FADE OUT.
                                     
                         THE END
