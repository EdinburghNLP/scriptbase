"Some people lose their faith because Heaven shows them too little," says Thomas Daggett.
"But how many people lose their faith because Heaven showed them too much?"
Daggett nearly became a priest; now he's a cop.
He may want to put religion behind him, but one morning a weird, eyeless, hermaphroditic corpse turns up.
Suddenly he is on a path that will put him right in the middle of a war in Heaven.
And once again, Heaven will show him too much: gore, blood, charred flesh, living corpses and much worse.
Even more central to the heavenly war effort is a young girl.
This American Indian child has something Gabriel wants.
And Gabriel is willing to kill her and anyone in his path - or even reanimate a corpse or two - to get it.
