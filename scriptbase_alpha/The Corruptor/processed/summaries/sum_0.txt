Nick Chen is one of New York City's most martial police officers and the first Chinese-born immigrant on the force.
Chen's job is to keep the peace in Chinatown from a turf war that has broken out between the Triads and the ruthless, and dangerous Fukienese Dragons.
Chen teams up with Danny Wallace, who is terribly unaware of this situation.
When the Tongs boldly attempt to bribe Wallace, Chen is forced to keep his faithfulness.
