2. CHINATOWN WAR
----------------

EXT: NEW YORK CITY, DAY

Credits roll over establishing shots of the city. First, 
primary MANHATTAN, the one tourists see on post 
cards. Then slowly, we drift into Chinatown. Side 
streets and back alleys so different you wouldn't 
even know your in the U.S...Eventually we stop on...

EXT: WINGS BAKERY SHOP, WEST BROADWAY, CHINATOWN 
-DAY

CUSTOMERS move in and out when BOOOOM! The screen 
EXPLODES in a ball of FIRE.

The bleeding PATRONS stumble into the street as 
flames pour from a gaping hole that was once a 
bustling Herb shop.

Across the street, a young ASIAN, poorly dressed, 
lights a smoke. His body is undernourished and 
covered with the tattoo insignia of the FUKIENESE 
DRAGONS. But it's his eyes that get your attention. 
Dark and hungry, they watch his day's work with the 
detachment of one who's been taught the value of 
life is zero. Meet BOBBY VU.

Oblivious to the chaos, he strides into the street 
flanked by three similarly tattooed youths who we 
will come to know as JACK, BLACK EYES and "THE TALL 
KID". Together they encircle a middle-aged TRIAD 
SYMPATHIZER dressed totally in his bakery whites, 
crawling from the rubble. The young gangsters 
brazenly pull pistols from their jackets.

	              BOBBY VU

	Fukienese Dragons not funny now.

The injured man futilely pulls a gun from his coat as 
the Dragons execute their prey in a barrage of 
gunfire. Smoke drifts from their weapons when Bobby 
notices a frightened TOURIST lying in a puddle of her 
own blood. He looks into her tear filled eyes and 
raises his gun to finish her. But she dies before he 
needs to shoot.

He then climbs into a rented Ford and takes off.

3. A BAD DEAL FOR THE FUKIENESE
-------------------------------

INT: PHAN HO'S LAMPS, CANAL STREET, NYC-NIGHT

For a lamp store the joint is dark. The only light comes from the 
merchandise burning 20 watt bulbs and a small black and white 
Zenith spouting tape delayed news from the bombing site.

	              REPORTER (TELEVISION)

	The tragic death of BETH KADELL from Fairlawn New Jersey 
	in this morning's Chinatown bombing has mobilized the city 
	and drawn attention to a six month war being waged in the 
	back alleys and underground corridors of the city's most
	mysterious neighborhood. According to police, the Fukienese 
	Dragons, a new entity in the Chinatown crime scene, are 
	headed by twenty year old Bobby Vu from the Fukien 
	province of China.

The television shows a surveillance photo of Bobby Vu as the 
sound of sporadic GRUNTS and a heavy WHACK...WHACK, emanates 
from the back of the shop.

Sitting at a table, drowning in a shower of sweat, is a fifty 
year old blob named PHAN HO. Nerves mask his face, when 
suddenly his arm lurches forward as if something or someone
pulled him. WHACK!

	              REPORTER (TELEVISION)

	Sources say the bombing and execution of a known Triad 
	Soldier are another chapter in the power struggle between 
	the Fukienese Dragons Youth Gang and the Triad run Tung 
	Fung Benevolent Association, Chinatown's ruling organized 
	crime entity for over a century, believed to be headed by 
	local businessman Benjamin Wong. Known in the community 
	as Uncle Benny.

A photo of sixty three year old Benny Wong fills the TV screen 
as Phan Ho takes a five from a dwindling stack of bills and pushes 
it across the table to NICK CHEN.

Chen's thirty six, and whatever money he earns is spent on clothes 
and fifty dollar haircuts. He's handsome and cool, with looks 
hailing more from his Hong Kong father than his mainland mom.

Phan watches as Chen takes a card from his hand and flips it onto 
the table. Ace of Spades. Phan drops a three of Clubs. Back and 
forth until Phan's empty and Chen's left with one card. He smiles, 
taking his time as the fat man wipes sweat from his brow.

	              PHAN
	Throw it!

Phan's poised to strike. Chen drops the card. Jack of Clubs. Both 
men move, but Chen's quicker. He pulls the card from the table 
letting Phan slam his hand on nothing but wood.

	WHACK!

Phan holds his palm as Chen picks up the cards and another five. 
He shuffles the deck skillfully with his right hand as his left 
fishes a smoke from his pocket.

	              PHAN
	              
	It's late. No Fukienese Dragons come here. I close now...OK?

On cue, the bell over the front door sounds trouble.

INT PHAN HO'S LAMPS - NIGHT

The youths entering the shop are FUKIENESE. Two, Jack and "The 
Tall Kid", we recognize as the shooters from Wing's. One of them, 
Fuke #1, stays outside to stand guard as the others approach Chen.

	              TALL KID
	              
	(Fukienese)
	Time to pay.

They move purposefully toward the two men as Chen drops a 
seven of clubs on the table and turns to Phan.

	              CHEN
	              
	You speak Fukienese?

Phan nods as the young thugs reach the table. Chen turns over 
a four of spades from the frightened shop owner's hand.

	              CHEN
	              
	Tell 'em they're in the wrong store.

	              TALL KID
	              
	Fuck you.

	              CHEN
	              
	Learned some English, good for you.

Chen pulls his .45 and lays the cannon on the table.

	              PHAN
	              
	Are you crazy?

Chen drops a Jack of hearts on the pile, covers it uncontested 
and takes a five from Phan's ever shrinking pile.

	              CHEN

	Lucky...are you?

Chen stares at the Tall Kid, goading him with his lack of 
concern...Three seconds pass like kidney stones... Finally, Chen 
laughs to himself, stands and puts his finger to the Tall Kid's 
head as if it were a play gun.

The lack of respect incites the Tall Kid to go for his gun. But 
before he can fire a shot, Chen produces a .38 from his sleeve 
and puts a bullet through the gangster's head.

Phan drops to the ground as Chen dives over the card table, 
grabbing his .45. He hits the floor pulling the table down with 
him as a shield for Phan, then himself as Fuke #2 shoots
wildly before being taken out by Chen.

Jack retreats to behind a wall, then slowly crosses through an 
archway to confront Chen from behind. As he steps out, he finds 
only Phan cowering on the floor. Chen has disappeared. Suddenly 
the place explodes in a hail of automatic gunfire as Fuke #1 
enters the store and sprays everything in sight, producing a 
blizzard of glass. Jack turns to see Chen has re-appeared and 
taken up postion behind a counter full of lamps and mirrors while
he takes on both Jack and Fuke #1. 

Chen skillfully uses one of the counters as cover as he makes 
his way towards the front ofthe store, gets a bead on the Fuke 
with the automatic and sends him flying back out the front 
door in a hail of glass- pedestrians scattering for their life. 

Jack, alone now, cowers behind an opposite counter, desperately 
crawling along the floor trying to make his way out of there. He 
peeks through an opening to his cover and find Chen nowhere in 
sight.

Slowly, painfully hunched over, he backs up towards the 
blown-out front door, checks for Chen one more time, then 
decides to make a run for it. Suddenly he's got a foot slamming
into the side of his head sending him crashing back to the floor. 
Chen has appeared out of nowhere.

Chen drives another kick into his stomach, then yanks him to 
his feet.

INT PHAN HO'S LAMPS - NIGHT

	              CHEN
	              
	English?

(The boy nods)

	What do they call you?

	              YOUNG GANGSTER
	              
	Jack.

	              CHEN
	              
	Tell Bobby Vu, his time is running out in Chinatown.

He kicks the kid out the door and turns toward the shell-shocked 
shopkeeper looking at the shambles of his livelihood.

A teetering lamp topples from a shot up table but Chen catches 
it before it hits the floor. He looks over at the owner, crying. 
Chen places a fist full of fives from his winnings on the counter.

	              CHEN
	              
	I'll take this one.

EXT: ONE POLICE PLAZA -DAY

Establishing.

INT: ONE POLICE PLAZA-DAY

A LACKEY for the Mayor stands at a podium addressing a room 
filled with UNIFORMS and PRESS. Beside him, sporting a chest 
full of commendations on his dress blues, is Nick Chen.

	              LACKEY
	
	In the history of the Fifteenth precinct, few officers have 
	done more to serve and protect the public of this great city  
	than Lieutenant Nicholas Chen...

In the rear of the room is DANNY WALLACE. He's 24 and has only 
four spaces on his face that need shaving. But his eyes are smart 
and always moving, except now. They're fixed on Nick Chen like 
he was delivering the sermon on the mount.

	              LACKEY

	...Lieutenant, for bravery in the line of fire and bringing to 
	justice those responsible for the Chinatown Bombing and 
	the tragic death of Beth Kadell, the mayor and people of 
	New York thank you and present you with this commendation.

The Lackey pins another hunk of brass on Chen as the room 
erupts in cheers. And no one louder than Danny Wallace, 
who whistles as the Lackey and Chen shake for the cameras.

INT: NICK CHEN'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN, MOTT STREET-NIGHT

The whistle comes from a screaming teapot. Chen, dressed in 
a robe, pours the water into a bowl of rice which begins 
sizzling like a steak. Unlike his wardrobe, his place is modest.
The lamp from Phan's fits in nicely.

Tired, he stares vacantly at the wallpaper until a gorgeous 
Chinese girl, 19, walks in from the bedroom. By the way 
she's tying her dress we know she was recently very naked. 
He knows her as MAY. Chen slides open a drawer and pulls out 
some cash.

	              MAY
	              
	(Cantonese)
	Mr. Lee said no charge.

She bows and walks out the door. Chen watches the young 
immigrant leave and can't help feeling like half a dirt-bag. 
He throws the cash back into the drawer and shuts it.

Eventually, he gets up and crosses to the window. He eats 
his soup in the lifeless apartment, glancing down at the 
simple, elegant shrine to his dead father. He turns his
attention out the window looking out on the palpable 
energy and vigor of a bustling Chinatown.

EXT: CHEN'S APARTMENT, MOTT STREET-LATER (NIGHT)

A rush of sound as Chen steps from the building. Activity 
swirls around him as he moves south on the narrow street.

His demeanor starts quiet. But as he moves through the 
boisterous people, who genuflect like he's an Arab Sheik, 
a smile curls his lips and the 200 watt bulbs behind his 
eyes flick on. Every man gets a nod and every girl gets 
a little bit more. It's his town...and it gives him life.

INT BLUE EMPRESS CAFE - NIGHT

He moves through the upscale family eatery, picking up 
the Bacardi and Coke a BARTENDER fixed the second he 
saw Chen step through the door. He strides into the kitCHEN...

INT BLUE EMPRESS KITCHEN - NIGHT 

...cuts to the back and approaches a door guarded by a 
wannabee SUMO wrestler. The big man lets him through.

INT BLUE EMPRESS OFFICE - NIGHT 

Inside, behind a desk sporting two surveillence monitors, 
working a phone is HENRY LEE. He's mid- forties and slicker 
than an oil spill. The consummate chameleon. Whatever he
needs to be, he is. If Satan walks earth, it's in the body of 
Henry Lee.

	              LEE
	              
	(Cantonese)
	Forty thousand a piece. Fifty percent up front or else 
	the shipment will never leave the boat...Fine.

Lee hangs up as Chen fires the smoke he lifted from an ivory box on Lee's desk.

	              LEE

	My congratulations on your commendation. I trust you 
	enjoyed the little gift I sent over.

Lee lights a cigarette of his own, enjoying making Chen feel 
like a mutt. Chen doesn't like it much, but knew it would happen 
the minute he started undressing Lee's present.

	              LEE
	              
	Uncle Benny is very proud of you.

Lee reaches into his desk drawer, produces a bulging envelope 
and hands it to Chen who quickly counts the pile of hundreds.

	              CHEN
	              
	Thought he'd be more proud this time.

	              LEE
	              
	He is.

Lee lifts his wastepaper basket revealing strips of paper.

	              LEE
	              
	Your markers. Two thousand eighty three of them. You 
	really should consider other forms of recreation.

Chen slides the envelope of cash into his jacket pocket.

	              CHEN
	              
	Your soldier who got killed the other day was working 
	with the F.B.I.

Lee's smile dampens but his calm remains intact.

	              LEE
	              
	Really?

	              CHEN
	              
	Medical Examiner found a wire on him and the Feds 
	came down to pick it up. Lucky for you it had about six 
	bullets in it so it wasn't much good.

	              LEE
	              
	Lucky for you too maybe.

Chen lets it pass.

	              CHEN
	              
	That, plus the tourist who got killed, have the
	Feds worked up. Word is they're going after the
	triad. Probably Uncle Benny himself.

	              LEE
	              
	Why us? It's the Fukienese Dragons who killed her. 
	We're just trying to do business as we've always done.

	              CHEN
	              
	Because you're suppose to keep order in Chinatown.

	              LEE
	              
	It's not like it once was. The youth gangs are not 
	easily controlled. They have no respect, no honor.

	              CHEN
	              
	That's your problem. You can't control them, the 
	Feds are gonna revoke your free parking.

	              LEE
	              
	Taking care of the Fukes is your problem. That's why 
	we pay you.

	              CHEN
	              
	Yeah, well, it doesn't really matter cause to the Feds 
	you're all the same.

	              LEE
	              
	You mean "we're" all the same. Remember, as I go, you go.

Chen doesn't say anything because he knows Lee's right. After 
a moment he gets up from the chair.

	              CHEN
	              
	The Ginza massage is getting a visit from us tomorrow 
	night, so move it or lose it.

	              LEE
	              
	Go ahead and take Ginza. More arrests will help keep 
	things calm.

A smiling Lee, stamps out his butt and circles the table.

	              LEE
	              
	If the Feds get near Uncle Benny, our heads go first. So 
	you do whatever it takes to make some kind of case against 
	Bobby Vu and the rest of the Fukes. I'm sure the FBI will be 
	just as happy with them. As you said, we're all the same.

Lee slides two tickets into Chen's front jacket pocket.

	              LEE
	              
	Knicks, court-side.

Chen puts down his glass and walks into the hallway.

INT BLUE EMPRESS HALLWAY - NIGHT 

He cuts across a narrow corridor and passes through a door tucked 
behind dried, hanging ducks. Then it's down a flight of stairs...

INT UNDERGROUND STAIRS &amp; HALLS - NIGHT

...through a maze of underground alley-ways, populated by well 
dressed TEENAGE THUGS, and into the world beneath Chinatown. 
Chen walks up toward a massive BOUNCER standing in front
of a steel door. He slides the tickets into his shirt pocket.

	              CHEN
	              
	Knicks, court-side.

The Bouncer opens the door, exposing a room filled with Chinese 
MEN playing all things you can wager a buck on.

INT GAMBLING PARLOR - NIGHT

Chen surveys the action which is loud, fast and furious. He 
fires a smoke, pulls a fist full of hundreds from his envelope 
and lays down his first bet of the night.

EXT: EAST BROADWAY ARCADE-NIGHT

Jack and his attractive girlfriend AMY SAN hang with their 
friends in front of the arcade when Bobby Vu and three other 
Dragons pull up in a red Lincoln. They quickly grab hold of
Jack.

	              BOBBY VU
	              
	(Fukienese)
	You let your brothers die?

Everything stops as Bobby punches, kicks and throws Jack 
around the street. The other Dragons keep everybody away, 
though they already seem to know.

	              JACK
	              
	(Fukienese)
	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

	              BOBBY VU
	              
	(Fukienese)
	Are you Fukienese Dragon?...ARE YOU?!

	              JACK
	              
	Yes.

Bobby looks over at Amy. She's sexy as hell and he lets 
her know he knows it. He then turns to Jack and grabs him 
by his hair.

	              BOBBY VU
	              
	Avenge your brothers. Kill that cop.

as Chen re-enters.

	Junior brought a scorecard.

Chen takes out a thick magic marker, starts crossing out photos.

	              CHEN
	              
	Dead, dead in prison. The rest usually stop by for a visit. 
	It's not healthy to let them know what we know....Why does a

	              WALLACE
	              
	I'm here so Chinese immigrants don't have to live thirty to a 
	room. Or spend twenty hours a day making clothes for slave 	
	  wages.

	              CHEN
	              
	Why do you give shit about Chinese immigrants?

	              WALLACE
	              
	I'm a cop. I give a shit about enforcing the law.

	              DENG
	              
	So what's your plan to save the yellow people?

	              WALLACE
	              
	Same techniques used on every other organized crime operation 
	in the city. Bust the street soldiers every time we see 'em, 
	move up the food chain to the Council, cramp 'em with 	
	surveillance, sting operations, keep climbing all the way to 
	Uncle Benny.

Chen laughs at Wallace's naivete.

	              UNG
	              
	This ain't every other organized crime operation in the city. 
	We work cases, Junior. Keep the tourists safe. Violence spills 
	into the street, we break heads. `Cept Detective Deng, she's 
	above that.

	              DENG
	              
	When the department authorizes police brutality perhaps I'll 
	join you.

	              CHEN
	              
	You don't change Chinatown, it changes you.

	              WALLACE
	              
	I'm ready to give it a shot.

Chen eyeballs the cocky kid.

	              CHEN
	              
	Alright...Don't make plans tonight.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Why?

	              UNG
	              
	Cause we're goin on a panty raid.

EXT: FIFTEENTH PRECINCT - DAY

Chen, in last night's clothes, climbs the steps of the 
yellowed brick building and steps inside.

INT: FIFTEENTH PRECINCT - DAY

Chen coughs hellos to the DESK PERSONNEL, cuts 
through a door marked ASIAN GANG UNIT and steps 
into a small colorless room.

INT: ASIAN GANG UNIT - DAY

He passes plums to his two Chinese-American 
detectives; WILLY UNG, sharp of tongue and nose...and 
LOUISE DENG, a by the book cop who puts in her eight 
and goes home to a family.

	              CHEN
	              
	Everybody works tonight, we're visiting Ginza 
	Massage.

	              UNG
	              
	My kind of raid.

Ung's accent is hard-core Bronx. On the phone you'd 
think he was an Italian from Eastchester Road.

	              UNG
	              
	Found another young pretty in a dumpster.

He tacks a crime scene photo onto a board already 
showing another woman lying in a dumpster when he 
notices a scratch on Chen's neck.

	              UNG
	              
	Anybody I know?

Chen removes Ung's smile with a look and pours 
himself a coffee.

	              DENG
	              
	Did a two hour sweep. No one would speak to me.

	              UNG
	              
	Try breath mints.
	Deng's accent is Connecticut, along with her 
	wardrobe. She ignores Ung as she cuts the plum into 
	four perfect slices.

	              DENG
	              
	And the two who found the body didn't see, hear or 
	smell anything.

	              CHEN
	              
	What's new?

We stay on Chen as a sudden silence descends. A beat 
and he turns to see why. There at the entrance to the 
AGU stands young WALLACE holding a box of personals.

	              WALLACE
	              
	I'm Daniel Wallace. 

He looks as if that's supposed to mean something. By 
the looks on the faces of the AGU members, it doesn't.

	              KLEIN (O.S.)
	              
	He spent six months in China on a college course 
	or some shit.

INT: FIFTEENTH PRECINCT, CAPTAIN'S OFFICE-DAY

CAPTAIN STAN KLEIN, a Chinese hater going back to his 
tour in `69, sits back with a cold washcloth over his 
eyes as Chen, looking like he ate a bad lemon, tosses 
Wallace's file onto the desk. 

	              CHEN
	              
	The Chinese don't trust whites or cops and you're 
	giving me a white cop.

	              KLEIN
	              
	They want ethnic diversity in every squad so you get 
	a white face in the AGU.

	              CHEN
	              
	He's worse than white, he's green.

	              KLEIN
	              
	Which is why you should school him.

	              CHEN
	              
	So he can get me killed?

	              KLEIN
	              
	Look, it's your fault he's here in the first place.

	              CHEN
	              
	My fault?

	              KLEIN
	              
	A freakin tourist got blown up in our backyard. Not to 
	mention an FBI snitch. And it happened on your 
	watch. The  Mayor's been on TV talking about it, the 
	Police Commisioner has promised safety on the 
	streets of Chinatown, Christ it's been on freakin 
	Nightline. So if putting a white cop in the Asian 
	Gang Unit makes them feel better and gets them off 
	my ass fine and dandy. So why don't you get out of 
	here and do something about these whores 
	turning up in dumpsters. It's embarrassing.

Klein sniffs the air, then peeks out from under his 
wash cloth.

	              KLEIN
	              
	You still here?

INT: AGU OFFICES - day

Wallace is tacking a photo layout of the Hip Sing Triad to 
the wall as Chen re-enters.

	              UNG
	              
	Junior brought a scorecard.

Chen takes out a thick magic marker, starts crossing out 
photos.

	              CHEN
	              
	Dead, dead in prison. The rest usually stop by for a 
	visit. It's not healthy to let them know what we 
	know....Why does a white cop request Asian Gangs?

	              WALLACE
	              
	Detective Shield, an extra eight grand a year in my 
	pocket...and a chance to work with you.

	              UNG
	              
	Uh oh. Yellow fever. You got a hard on for all things 
	Chinese, right? The food, customs, women. You got 
	a Chinese girlfriend, don't ya?

	              WALLACE
	              
	Actually, uh....no.

	              CHEN
	              
	But ya did?

	              WALLACE
	              
	Are we all gonna exchange sexual histories?

	              UNG
	              
	I knew it. Yellow fuckin fever. Junior's here to walk

5. THE GINZA RAID
-----------------

EXT: PANTY RAID BUILDING - DUSK

Except for the ten COPS moving quickly toward an 
unmarked door, the alley is empty. Out front is Chen. 
He orders a thick COP toward the door which is 
quickly opened with a crowbar.

INT: PANTY RAID BUILDING, STAIRCASE - NIGHT
Chen calmly lays his dark hankerchief over the tiny 
survellience camera, then leads the group up the 
stairs.

	              UNG
	              
	(whispers to Wallace) You never know how a guy 
	gettin his dick rubbed is gonna react when you 
	charge into the room, so keep your eyes sharp and 
	your Glock cocked. And don't be trying to feel any 
	Chinese titties you little pervert.

Snickers from the men.

	              CHEN
	              
	Wallace stays out here.

Wallace doesn't like it, but doesn't argue it. Chen pulls 
his .45 and nods to the thick Cop, who thrusts his 
crowbar into the lock jam and snaps it off. They hit 
the hallway like a tornado. Bright lights strobe the 
length of the place thrusting us several minutes into 
the future.

INT: GINZA MASSAGE HALLWAY - A SHORT TIME LATER

The cops are dragging about ten prostitutes and 
matching Johns into the hallway. 

Chen coordinates when he sees Deng leading May and 
three other dressed prostitues from the front 
towards the back hallway. May looks at Chen and he 
knows why Lee smiled when he gave him the Ginza.

	              CHEN
	              
	Deng. See if you can find any files back there.
	He turns to a uniform.

	              CHEN 
	              
	(referring to the prostitutes)
	Joe, take Ôem down, Wallace'll help ya write 
	Ôem up.

Deng heads back down the hall while the uniform 
corrals the girls down the stairs the cops came up. 
Chen grabs May as she passes and pulls her into one 
of the bedrooms.  

INT: 1ST GINZA BEDROOM

Chen reaches into May's pocket, finding a packet of 
white powder. She tries to kiss him. He pulls away 
and pockets the heroin, pissing her off. He quiets her 
with three hundreds.

	              CHEN
	              
	(Cantonese)
	Get outta here.

He gently nudges her out to the hallway and towards 
the backstairs where Wallace is just coming up with a 
handfull of paperwork.

	              WALLACE
	              
	You want me to take her?

Chen shakes his head as he lets May head towards 
the exit. He turns back to Wallace who stands talking 
to a uniform who is handing him some paperwork.

	              CHEN
	              
	(sotto to Wallace)
	Always throw back the smallest of the day's 
	catch.

Suddenly a torrent of automatic gunfire explodes at 
the opposite end of the hallway taking out the glass 
door and the uniform who stood in front of it 
revealing a Fukiense shooter behind the shatterered 
door. One cop down. Chen's instinct are immediate.The 
Fuke killer is toast. The uniform who was talking to 
Wallace turns towards the action and is met with a 
pile of lead exploding his heart, blowing out his back 
and spraying Wallace with blood. Wallace freezes- a 
deer in the headlight. Chen sees this, jumps across 
the hall and pushes Wallace out of the line of fire and 
into one of the bedrooms. The doorway where Wallace 
stood explodes into a million pieces of shrapnel. He 
would have been chopmeat. Just at that moment, Ung 
crosses the hall in the opposite direction, shielding a 
prostitute as he takes out the shooter who took out 
the uniform and almost Wallace.

Chen leans out of what remains of the doorway, while 
yelling back to the still shell-shocked Wallace.

	              CHEN
	              
	Fire your weapon!

	              UNG
	              
	They're Fukes!

The entire compliment is pinned down in either the 
rooms or the hallway facing down three furious 
Fukes. Chen pumps his final ammo clip into his gun, 
pulls a second gun from an ankle holster and fires 
away. Suddenly, another Fuke with an automatic 
weapon comes out of nowhere and advances 
kamakazi style to one of the bedrooms- the P.D.'s 
gunfire no match for his Uzi. He's got Chen, Ung, Deng, 
Wallace and the five remaining uniforms pinned down. 
Chen thinks fast, retreats into the bedroom- 

INT: 1ST GINZA BEDROOM

Chen quickly feels the solidity of the walls- finds the 
weak spot of the plasterboard and starts kicking 
through to the next room while the firefight 
continues in the hallway.

INT: 2ND GINZA BEDROOM

The uniforms fighting at the doorway turn to see Chen 
come crashing into their room and continue on right 
to the next wall, battling his way up the hallway 
towards the Fukes position the only way he can.

INT: HALLWAY

The firefight continues but it's totally one sided as 
the cops pistols can't compete against the Uzi. 
Windows to the bedrooms are exploding like 
firecrackers, whores and johns caught out in the 
hallway shiver in terror behind whatever cover they 
can find. A huge glass display in the hallway implodes 
drenching the place in flying glass. 

Wallace does the best he can, firing uselessly at the 
kamikazi, only visible from the neck up as he keeps 
the entire force at bay. Suddenly we see a glock come 
up to the back of the shooter's head which blows his 
brains out into the hallway, finally silencing the 
automatic. Chen steps out, the arm behind the hit. 
There's only three fukes left now, including Jack, 
armed only with semi-automatics.

	              CHEN
	              
	I'm out on three! One, two, 
	three!

Every cop steps out and bombards the end of the hall 
with all the firepower they've got. They pin back the 
shooters as Chen storms into the hall and races, guns 
blazing toward the gunmen. All three of them flee, 
one down the stairs, Jack and the other up towards 
the roof. Chen decides to go up, negotiating each 
corner with whatever he's got left. He gets to the 
second flight just in time to see Jack desperately kick 
out a window and make a run across a rooftop. Chen 
continues the last flight up where he finds the lone 
Fuke out of amo and desperately trying to tear open 
the roof acess door which is bolted shut. 

	              CHEN (cont'd)
	              
	Weapon down, hands in 
	the air, up against the 
	wall. 

The Fuke cooperates, backing up onto the landing as 
Chen ascends.

	              CHEN (cont'd)
	              
	Turn around!

The kid does, but as he moves he suddenly produces a 
knife the size of a baby's arm that cuts across Chen, 
slicing his stomach. Chen reacts with amazing speed, 
smashing his gun across the gangster's head almost 
decaptating him. Simultaneously, the last Fuke comes 
charging up the stairs, Chen picks up the guy next to 
him and hurls him over the staircase knocking the 
charging Fuke down to the next landing. His gun goes 
flying right towards Wallace's feet who together with 
a backup of unifroms, comes bounding around the 
corner, grabs the weapon and covers the two punks.
Chen looks down from top landing

	              CHEN
	              
	You're late.

INT: KUNG PHO RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Ung and Chen storm into the twelve-table restaurant 
filled mostly with teenage Fukienese. They move 
toward the rear of the restaurant passing Jack, 
huddled with two of his friends.

Some of the gangsters stand to run interference, but 
the two cops push through them to a back table 
where Bobby Vu works a cell phone. Without a word 
Chen punches him out of his chair. He hits him again 
and again, knocking the gangster into the kitchen.

INT: KUNG PHO RESTAURANT KITCHEN - NIGHT

Ung pulls his gun, holding the other gangsters at bay 
as Chen grabs a sauce pan from the overhead rack 
and slams it into Bobby Vu's head, knocking him to the 
floor. He then throws it at the group of Dragons 
closing in around them.

	              CHEN
	              
	Want some?

No one does. He stares down the gangsters with 
disgust.

	              CHEN
	              
	Fukienese Dragons.

He spits on the floor then walks out the rear door 
with Ung.

6. A BUST FOR WALLACE
---------------------

EXT: DAVIS STREET-DAY

A hazy sun slices through thick clouds as Chen, 
carrying a take-out bag, exits a small storefront and 
gets into a brown Chevy.

INT: BROWN CHEVY - DAY

Wallace drives as Chen pulls a container from the bag.

	              CHEN
	              
	Fishball Gongee. Wanna be Chinese you've gotta eat 
	the nasty stuff. 

Wallace takes the food, looks over at Chen.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Last night...You saved my life.

	              CHEN
	              
	Part of the job.
	
	              WALLACE
	              
	Maybe...I still want to say thanks.

Chen nods as he eats. Wallace turns up Delancey.

	              WALLACE
	              
	That said...I heard you paid a visit to Bobby Vu last 
	night.

Wallace looks at Chen.

	              WALLACE (cont'd)
	              
	I tightened up last night, but I didn't find this 
	badge in the bottom of a Cracker Jack box. I 
	earned it.

	              CHEN
	              
	You study Chinese so you know what it means that I 
	saved your life?

	              WALLACE
	              
	It means my life is yours, to do with as you wish

	              CHEN
	              
	That's right. So here's my advice. Quit. Before you 
	end up dead.

They drive past a crumbling building where a TRIAD 
SOLDIER openly does a healthy drug trade. 

	              WALLACE
	              
	I know the risks.

	              CHEN
	              
	So did the cops I didn't save last night. And all it 
	got them was dead. This isn't fun and games. 
	Especially for a kid heading to Law School 
	with his head up his ass if he thinks this is the way 
	to raise tuition.

Wallace's a bit surprised Chen knows this.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Just cause I'm not putting in twenty doesn't mean I 
	can't do the job.

	              CHEN
	              
	Yes it does.

	              WALLACE
	              
	You don't want to work with me, fine. Let me do 
	my own investigations. But don't try and keep me 
	from my work. Cause like it or not, I'm a cop.

	              CHEN
	              
	You're playing cop and that's gonna get one of us 
	killed.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Playin'? Who's playin'? Playin's driving by shit and 
	pretending you didn't see it.

Chen turns to Wallace.

	              CHEN
	              
	You got something to say, say it.

	              WALLACE
	              
	How 'bout I show you?

Wallace slams on the brakes, sending the take-out 
flying onto the dash. He then drops it in reverse and 
floors the gas. The Chevy roars backwards up onto 
the sidewalk in front of a crumbling building.

EXT: CRUMBLING BUILDING - DAY

Wallace jumps from the car, catches one of the two 
well dressed triad DRUG DEALERS hanging out front, 
pushes him through the door and into the building.

INT: CRUMBLING BUILDING - DAY

A dark, piss stenched room called home by fourteen 
rats and a dozen ADDICTS sharing needles and 
mindless nods. The Dopers can't move but three more 
DEALERS can and take off running.

	              WALLACE
	              
		FREEZE!

Wallace fires over their heads, stopping them in their 
tracks as Chen races into the room. Wallace frisks the 
Dealer he pushed inside as Chen looks over the 
others.

	              WALLACE
	              
	What do we have here?

Wallace pulls a thick packet of heroin from the kid's 
pocket. Impressed with himself, he holds it up and 
tosses it at Chen, looking at him through steel grey 
eyes.

INT: FIFTEENTH PRECINCT, BOOKING ROOM-LATER (DAY)

The four Dealers stand handcuffed to a steel beam 
riveted to the wall as Wallace files his first arrest 
with the DESK SERGEANT. Chen casually sips coffee 
when a pissed off six footer in a blue suit rushes into 
the room.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	Get each one of these guys 
	in different rooms...NOW!

PETE SCHABACKER holds up an FBI badge which gets 
everybody moving. Two UNIFORMS unclasp the perps 
and take them away. Schabacker looks at Chen and 
gestures towards the AGU.

INT: AGU OFFICE

Schabacker hardly looks at Ung and Deng who pour 
over paperwork as Chen and Wallace follow him into 
the room.

	              CHEN
	              
	Something bothering you, Pete?

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	Only that you assholes just arrested a federal agent 
	working undercover with the  Triad.

Wallace pales as Ung smiles to himself.

	              UNG
	              
	Nice work, Junior.

	              WALLACE
	              
	I made the arrest.

Wallace looks over at Chen who's offering no help

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	Well goody for you, Einstein. So tell me, what 
	am I supposed to do now? Put a Federal Agent in jail 
	to maintain his cover. What? Let him go? We put 
	him back on the street everybody in Chinatown 
	will think he cut a deal with you and he'll be dead 
	inside an hour. So what should I do?

Wallace looks over at Chen, who's offering no help.

	              WALLACE
	              
	You should do a better job of keeping us informed.

	              UNG
	              
	Here here.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	Confidential undercover assignment. Key word 
	being confidential. Which nothing in the fifteenth 
	precinct is.

	              CHEN
	              
	Relax, Pete.We lost the bag. No evidence. They can 
	all go.

Wallace looks over at Chen, but he doesn't dispute him.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	Keep 'em three hours, slap the shit out of 'em and let 
	'em go. I want everything on the Ginza raid by the 
	end of the day. And keep that dipshit on a leash.

	              CHEN
	              
	You take care of your people, I'll take care of mine.

Wallace appreciates Chen's back up. Schabacker 
heads out the door.

	              CHEN
	              
	Which one's the Fed?

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	The Chinese one.

	              CHEN
	              
	Up yours too.

Ung takes the paperwork from the Desk and holds it 
out to Wallace.

	              UNG
	              
	You wanna eat this with soy sauce?

Wallace takes it from Ung's hand and tears it in half.

INT: JIMMY LOO'S COCKTAIL LOUNGE-NIGHT

No tourists, this watering hole's for the locals. 
Getting another round of Tsiang Taos from the 
WAITRESS is Chen, Wallace and Ung.

	              UNG
	              
	Cough up the cash, Junior. Knuckleheads 
	buy all rounds.

Wallace pays off the waitress as he snaps at Ung.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Eat me.

	              UNG
	              
	That's it, show a little piss and vinegar. So 
	your first bust was a Federal Agent and a 
	senior Fed bit off a giant piece of your ass.

Chen laughs with Ung as Wallace takes a drink.
	
	              UNG
	              
	Hey Junior, I dunno if you noticed, but 
	there're Chinese girls here.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Sounds like you're the one with yellow 
	fever.

	              UNG
	              
	Yellow fever, black plague, brown sugar, 
	white bread, I got it all.

Wallace can't help but smile.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Why does the FBI want the info on the 
	Ginza raid?

	              CHEN
	              
	It was their raid. They use us so the locals 
	don't smell feds. Mostly they use us 
	cause they're lazy shits.

	              UNG
	              
	Last summer we grabbed a Viet Namese gang bringing 
	in Heroin by the boatload. Who swoops in last minute 
	for the credit? Your friend Shabacker of the FBI.

	              WALLACE
	              
	We had the same problem in the one six, there's 
	nothing you can do.

	              UNG
	              
	A guy pisses in the street that's one thing. A guy 
	pisses in your house you deal with him or live with 
	the stench.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Very poetic. Unfortunately I don't know what the hell 
	you're talking about.

	              CHEN
	              
	The Feds lost a snitch. Now they have an agent 
	working undercover in the triad. We find the agent, 
	see what he's got going, and when the eleventh 
	hour hits we swoop in, make the bust and pull the 
	case right out from under them.

Appearing quietly as if from some unseen back 
entrance, Henry Lee appears through the crowd.

	              LEE
	              
	(to Chen in Cantonese)
	I don't believe I know your friend. A new soldier 
	in the fight against crime?

	              CHEN
	              
	(Cantonese)
	He won't be here long enough to get to know.

	              WALLACE
	              
	(Cantonese)
	I hope to be here long enough to make a 
	difference. Chen, Ung and Lee all look astonished 
	at Wallace's heretofor unknown language skills.

	              UNG
	              
	You speak Chinese!?

	              WALLACE
	              
	(Cantonese)
	I'm not a total knucklehead.

	              UNG
	              
	Whoa, in case you haven't noticed, I'm bronx born 
	and bred. The only Chinese I know is the Miranda 
	rights and what's on the menu.

	              CHEN
	              
	Danny Wallace, Henry Lee.

	              LEE
	              
	You gentlemen are partners?

	              WALLACE
	              
	(to Chen)
	Are we?

	              CHEN
	              
	Cagney and Lacey.

	              LEE
	              
	Chinatown needs more police. I hope you find a 
	home here. I think you'll discover the Chinese 
	people are warm and generous.

	              WALLACE
	              
	(Cantonese)
	I've already discovered that.

	              UNG
	              
	Speak English, already.

	              LEE
	              
	Never mind them. Reach out to our community,  it 
	will reach out to you. Isn't that right, Detective?

Chen holds up his glass in a mock toast...The Waitress 
brings over a bottle of Cristal and three glasses.

	              LEE
	              
	I hope to see much of you over the coming weeks.

Lee then disappears into the back as the Waitress 
pours.

	              WALLACE
	              
	(quietly)
	He's Triad.

	              UNG
	              
	That's why it's Cristal and not Asti fuckin' Spumanti.

Chen and Ung clink glasses and down some bubbly.

EXT: BENEVOLENT ASSOCIATION- DAY

Establishing. Tucked between a pair of banks sits the 
sand colored building highlighted with artifacts from 
ancient Chinese culture.

INT: BENEVOLENT ASSOCIATION- DAY

A small group of Elderly Men sit at game tables 
playing Mahjong. Sitting in the rear of such a table, 
playing a round is Benny Wong and Henry Lee.

	              BENNY WONG
	              
	(Cantonese)
	It's very dangerous to approach a white cop. We 
	can't risk exposing our other ties in the 
	Department.

	              LEE
	              
	(Cantonese)
	That's why we must approach Wallace. He could 
	compromise Chen at a time when he is our best 
	weapon against the Fukes. We need him with us 
	to safeguard Chen's position. Besides, to the NYPD
	Chen is Chinese first and a cop second.

	              WONG
	              
	(Cantonese)
	Chen can take care of himself. And he knows 
	what we need him to know.

	              LEE
	              
	(Cantonese)
	He knows what he hears in the Fifteenth. A white 
	officer would have ears outside the precinct. We 
	can let Chen test the waters.

Benny nods his acceptance and continues to Play.

INT: BLUE EMPRESS CAFE - DAY

In between lunch and dinner. Lee is emptying the bar 
of cash while waiters change the table linen. Chen 
enters, moves directly to Lee

	              CHEN
	              
	What do you want?

	              LEE
	              
	I like your partner.

Chen looks at Lee who turns from the bar and begins 
walking the length of the restaurant towards the 
kitchen straightening napkins and silverware as he 
goes.

	              LEE
	              
	I think he could help us.

	              CHEN
	              
	He could hurt us more.

	              LEE
	              
	Afraid of competition?

	              CHEN
	              
	Afraid of piquing the kid's interest...

	              LEE
	              
	...in who else is a dirty cop?

Chen pretends to ignore him.

	              LEE
	              
	Uncle Benny feels he might poke his nose in places a 
	Chinese cop wouldn't.

	              CHEN
	              
	I can handle him.

	              LEE
	              
	He also feels he could be an asset against the Fukes 
	since you don't seem to be doing much.

	              CHEN
	              
	I'll take care of the Fukes. The kid's a short timer. 
	Leave him alone.

	              LEE
	              
	I didn't realize you had such maternal 
	instincts...Uncle Benny wants you to speak with 
	him.

	              CHEN
	              
	No.

Lee and Chen reach the kitchen, where amongst the 
chickens, ducks and steaming dumplings, Triad 
underlings are moving boxes of tourist trinkets that 
fell off of some truck somewhere. Lee reaches into 
one and pulls out a fake Rolex.

	              LEE
	              
	This cost one dollar to make. And some fool will 
	pay hundreds for it. It's amazing how easy it is for 
	some people to over estimate worth. Don't 
	overestimate yours. Talk to him.

INT: FIFTEENTH PRECINCT - DAY

Chen, lost in thought, enters the station house when 
Wallace comes out of the A.G.U. office.

	              WALLACE
	              
	There's a homicide on Worth.
	
8. ANOTHER VICTIM
-----------------

EXT: REAR ENTRANCE OF A RESTAURANT-DAY

UNIFORMS from the Fifteenth have the area around 
the dumpster taped off as Wallace and Chen pull up 
and cross toward Deng and Ung.

	              CHEN
	              
	Who's in the bin?

	              DENG
	              
	The invisible woman. No I.D., no print record, no 
	nothing.

Wallace looks into the dumpster where a young 
female, is tangled with yesterday's shellfish. He 
instantly begins dry heaving.

	              UNG
	              
	I thought you liked Chinese food, Junior?

	              CHEN
	              
	Leave him alone...Let's go, I need about fifty 
	coffees.

	              WALLACE
	              
	We're not gonna investigate this?

	              CHEN
	              
	We just did.

	              WALLACE
	              
	What're you talking about? 

	              CHEN
	              
	Tell our partner what we learned.

Ung puts on his Academy Instructor persona.

	              UNG
	              
	Deceased is an illegal straight off the boat, 
	probably less than a week cause there's two 
	bills Chinese under the oysters, by her spleen.

	              DENG
	              
	She finds her passage over was twice what she 
	thought. She can't pay and doesn't like working 
	as a prostitute. So she ends up here. No family, 
	no friends, no witnesses.

	              UNG
	              
	No sense wastin taxpayers' money.

Wallace looks painfully at the young woman being 
pulled from the bin and stuffed unceremoniously into 
a body bag.

	              WALLACE
	              
	So what? Case closed?

	              UNG
	              
	He's so young.

Chen looks at Wallace. Remembers when he was that 
young.

	              CHEN
	              
	Take a walk around with Deng. See if anybody 
	knows anything.

Chen motions for Ung to come with him and the two 
cops move off.

EXT: EAST BROADWAY ARCADE-DAY

Jack and his girlfriend step from the arcade. He kisses 
her goodbye and watches her as she heads north up 
East Broadway.

He turns and heads south. He moves slowly down the 
empty street as someone or something moves up 
behind him. Quickly. He feels the presence and turns 
as Chen and Ung grab hold of him and pull him into a 
deserted alley.

EXT: ALLEYWAY-DAY

Jack tries to get away but Ung slams the small boy 
into the wall.

	              UNG
	              
	Easy Jackarroo.

Jack looks at the two men as they close in on him.

	              UNG
	              
	Detective Chen is now able to I.D. the shooter 
	who got away from the lamp store.

	              CHEN
	              
	Unless he can do something for me...I want 
	Bobby Vu.

A bead of cold sweat tumbles down the back of Jack's 
neck.

	              JACK
	              
	He'll kill me.

	              UNG
	              
	The alternative to helping us is ten to twenty at 
	Sing Sing. And that's gotta hurt. Especially for 
	somebody five foot nothin.

Jack stands with a million things racing through his 
mind.

	              JACK
	              
	No court? No wire?

	              CHEN
	              
	No promises. Think about it. You've got ten 
	seconds to make up your mind.

Jack thinks....

	              JACK
	              
	Fuck you.

Jack runs but Ung slams his fist into his face knocking 
him cold.

	              UNG
	              
	Kid's loyal.

Ung kneels and cuffs the unconscious Fukienese 
soldier.

	              CHEN
	              
	See how loyal he is after two weeks in lock up.

EXT: WORTH STREET - DAY

Deng and a very frustrated Wallace, stand outside a 
junk shop where a frightened CHINESE WOMAN, shakes 
her head.

	              WALLACE
	              
	(Cantonese)
	We're trying to help you.

Deng holds out a business card but the woman slams 
the door.

	              WALLACE
	              
	What's wrong with these people?

	              DENG
	              
	They don't like me, don't trust you and 
	know we can't protect them.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Then what's the point? Why bother?

The two cops walk south on Worth Street as they 
continue to talk.

	              DENG
	              
	Every cop starts out planning to save the 
	universe. When you realize you can't you've got 
	two choices. Do your best and the second the 
	shift's over go home to a life. Or let the stink 
	of the street get on you so you end up like ninety 
	percent of the cops in this city. An alcoholic 
	with more vices then half the people you arrest.

	              WALLACE
	              
	You're talkin about Chen?

	              DENG
	              
	I'm talking about you.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Well how does he close so many cases?

The inquiry makes her uncomfortable.

	              DENG
	              
	He works the cases he can solve. And he's not 
	American born, he's Hong Kong, immigrant like 
	them.

	              WALLACE
	              
	How does a guy from Hong Kong get in the NYPD?

	              DENG
	              
	They wanted a Chinese to speak to the Chinese. And 
	his father was a cop in Hong Kong. Pretty big 
	wheel before they booted him, he knew people in 
	Chinatown who could vouch for his son.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Why'd they boot him, was he dirty?

	              DENG
	              
	Because he wasn't. Shift's over, go home.

Deng turns up Elizabeth street and Wallace heads off 
toward Doyers.

9. FAMILY BUSINESS
------------------

EXT: WALLACE'S APT - DAY

Wallace cuts across a city baseball diamond in the 
shadow of the Manhattan Bridge and makes his way 
to his front door.

INT: WALLACE'S APARTMENT-DAY

He enters the one bedroom brick box and hits a light 
switch. It's clear he's just moved in because most of 
his things are still in boxes. What furnishings he has 
are accented with Chinese artifacts and books on 
Chinese culture. He heads into the dingy kitchen.

INT: WALLACE'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN-DAY

He gets a water and drops in some Alka Seltzer. He 
sits at the window and holds the cold glass to his 
forehead while the tablets fizz. 

EXT: WALLACE'S APT - DAY

What he doesn't see, is Bobby Vu's Lieutenant, BLACK 
EYES, watching him from the empty market across the 
street.

INT: WALLACE'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN -DAY

He downs the drink as a SHADOW creeps toward him. 
He hears a creak in the floor. In a flash he bolts to his 
feet, pulls his gun and spins to face a large MAN, 
maybe sixty, wearing beat up threads.

	              WALLACE
	              
	I coulda killed you.

	              SEAN WALLACE
	              
	I coulda killed you first.

	              WALLACE
	              
	What're you doing here?

	              SEAN WALLACE
	              
	Father can't visit his son? 
	Got something to drink? 
	I'm dry as a ninety year 
	old tit.

	              WALLACE
	              
	How'd you get in?

Sean pulls a flask from his jacket.

	              SEAN WALLACE
	              
	I brought somethin anyway. Join me?

Sean extends the offer but his son doesn't flinch.

	              SEAN WALLACE
	              
	Twenty years robbery homicide outta the two 
	five, greenhorn, that's how I got in. I been 
	hrough more doors and windows...

	              WALLACE
	              
	I don't have any money.

Sean takes a pull from the flask.

	              SEAN WALLACE
	              
	I'm in for twelve grand. Those fuckin dagos down 
	on Mulberry. Wallace knows this is serious but 
	doesn't show anything to his father.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Good luck.

	              SEAN WALLACE
	              
	I'm not asking for the twelve...God forbid you'd 
	bail me out with your lawyer money. Wouldn't 
	want you to miss becoming a leech asshole.

	              WALLACE
	              
	And here I thought you'd want me to be a chip off 
	the 'ol block.

	              SEAN WALLACE
	              
	All I'm askin for is a little stake money to help me 
	get even.

	              WALLACE
	              
	ouldn't work, you're too much a loser.

	              SEAN WALLACE
	              
	Then we'll go partners. You're a lucky son of a 
	bitch ain't ya?

Wallace doesn't say anything.

	              SEAN WALLACE
	              
	I wouldn't be here if it wasn't serious.

It takes a while but Wallace finally makes a move. He 
opens the fridge, slides open the crisper and pulls out 
an envelope. He hands it to his father who smiles at 
the money.

	              SEAN WALLACE
	              
	Cold hard cash. You slay me.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Little over five hundred and we ain't partners. 
	This is buying you off. Next time someone sneaks 
	up on me...

	              SEAN WALLACE
	              
	Yeah, yeah, yeah. You'll kill me.

Sean turns and starts for the door. Then stops.

	              SEAN WALLACE
	              
	By the way. You got a chink watchin you from 
	across the street, Sherlock.

Wallace turns to the window and sees Bobby Vu's boy, 
Black Eyes standing in the shadows across the street 
as his father slips out the door with a slight chuckle.

	              SEAN WALLACE (cont'd)
	              
	Goodnight officer.

10. AN EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION
------------------------------

INT: UNDERGROUND SPA-NIGHT

Through the steam, we see Henry Lee sitting in a tub 
filled with hot water. Standing near the doorway in 
street clothes is Chen.

	              CHEN
	              
	I've got something for you.

	              LEE
	              
	I love gifts.

A female arm runs a wet sponge down Lee's back.

	              CHEN
	              
	This isn't free ... Forget the kid.

	              LEE
	              
	That's an expensive request.

	              CHEN
	              
	This is an expensive item. 

Lee pulls the female arm into him. It's connected to 
May. Chen spots her, and it bothers him more than he 
lets on.

	              LEE
	              
	Let's hear it.

	              CHEN
	              
	The F.B.I. have another informant inside the Triad. 
	This time, it's one of their own- it's an agent.

Lee strokes the May's hair as she slides her nude 
body against his. He enjoys the fact that Chen's not 
enjoying it.

	              LEE
	              
	Who is it?

	              CHEN
	              
	Don't know. We picked up four of your guys and one 
	was a Fed. Won't take long to find out which one. Then 
	all you've got to do is blow his cover and they'll pull 
	him. No violence, no mess.

	              LEE
	              
	My thanks.

	              CHEN
	              
	The kid's out.

	              LEE
	              
	As you wish.

	Lee turns May toward Chen and rubs her breasts.

	              LEE
	              
	Would you like a turn?

Chen, looks at the young girl then turns and exits the 
room. Lee laughs as a figure moves out of a steam 
room behind him.

	              LEE
	              
	We've got a Federal Agent sniffing around. We'll have 
	to postpone delivery.

	Lee glances toward Fukienese leader, Bobby Vu.

	              BOBBY VU
	              
	We can't. The boat's coming into port next week.

	              LEE
	              
	Then it'll wait at the port.

	              BOBBY VU
	              
	I'm not afraid of the F.B.I.

Lee pushes May under the water toward his crotch.

	              LEE
	              
	Everything we've done has been to keep the Feds 
	focused on Uncle Benny. When he's gone, and I lead 
	the triad, you and your Fukienese brothers will 
	make all the money you want.

	              BOBBY VU
	              
	Then let's kill him now.

	              LEE
	              
	When Uncle Benny's indicted, he'll be 
	dangerous to our partners in Hong Kong. And 
	killing him, will come with thanks 
	instead of retribution.

	              BOBBY VU
	              
	And Chen too.

	              LEE
	              
	All in time.

EXT: GOLDFLOWER RESTAURANT, DOYERS STREET, MORNING

Through the glass we see Wallace pay the tab on his 
morning's breakfast. He picks up a toothpick and a 
mint and exits the building. He starts to move east 
when a man steps beside him.

	              LEE
	              
	Do you remember me?

Wallace looks closer...and sees Henry Lee who stays 
in step with Wallace as he walks up Bowery.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Yeah.

	              LEE
	              
	I have information about the girl you found in the 
	garbage dumpster.

	              WALLACE
	              
	How'd you find me?

	              LEE
	              
	You're conspicuous in Chinatown...Two brothers 
	on Chrystie Street bring in illegals. The woman, 
	worked in their brothel, then tried to run. They left 
	her as a message to the others.

	              WALLACE
	              
	How do you know?

	              LEE
	              
	Everyone knows. But no one's going to speak of it. 
	Especially to the police.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Why are you?

	              LEE
	              
	I knew her.

Lee looks at Wallace, and for a moment he seems 
almost sad.

	              WALLACE
	              
	What are their names?

	              LEE
	              
	You can't tell anyone how you found out. Not even 
	Chen.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Forget it.

	              LEE
	              
	For every person who knows, the chances of me, 
	or one of my children being killed in reprisal 
	increases a hundred fold.

	              WALLACE
	              
	I can't.

	              LEE
	              
	That girl was fifteen...And there are more to come if 
	you don't help us. Wallace thinks, remembering 
	the girl as she was stuffed into the body bag....He 
	knows he shouldn't, but he nods his head and Lee 
	hands him a piece of paper.

	              LEE
	              
	Check the basement of a place called TONY'S. Don't 
	worry. This is how things get done in Chinatown. 

INT: FIFTEENTH PRECINCT, AGU OFFICE-DAY

Chen enters the room where Deng is filling out 
paperwork.

	              CHEN
	              
	Wallace come in yet?

	              DENG
	              
	I don't think so.

The concern is easily read on Chen's face.

EXT: 142 CHRYSTIE STREET-DAY

Wallace anxiously watches the apartment building. He 
steadies his nerves, then crosses the street and 
enters through the front door.

INT: 142 CHRYSTIE HALLWAY - DAY

It's damp and poorly lit. Wallace moves down the 
narrow hall and stops by the door next to the 
incinerator. He jimmies the lock.

INT: 142 CHRYSTIE BASEMENT, STAIRS - DAY

He descends the stairs into the darkness. His mouth 
dries as he pulls his gun. He moves down a narrow 
corridor, passing a wooden door, when he hears 
something from inside. Faint breathing. He reaches 
for the doorknob. It's locked. He takes the slim jim 
from his jacket pocket and easily opens the door.

INT: 142 CHRYSTIE BASEMENT ROOMS - DAY

It's dark. Wallace takes his mag-light and scopes the 
room. He steps back, startled, when he sees thirty 
FEMALE FACES, gaunt, eyes glazed, huddled in the 
room like prisoners of war. None look older than 
fifteen. Wallace stands looking at the young women 
when he hears noise further down the hall. Slowly, he 
steps back

INT: 142 CHRYSTIE BASEMENT, CORRIDOR-DAY

and creeps toward a second door framed with the 
bright light from within. It sounds like a small motor 
mixed with whimpering. He looks through the 
keyhole. It takes a moment for his eye to adjust. 
When it does he jumps to his feet and kicks open the 
door.

INT: 142 CHRYSTIE BASEMENT ROOMS - DAY

	              WALLACE
	              
	POLICE!

The room is awash in bright light, almost blinding 
Wallace coming from the darkness. But there, on a 
bed, he sees the source of the cries. Three young 
WOMEN engaged in forced sex.
He turns toward the light which is set atop a video 
camera recording the scene. A MAN, mid forties, 
throws the camera at Wallace and races for the door. 
Wallace tackles him into the dark hallway...

INT: 142 CHRYSTIE BASEMENT, CORRIDOR-DAY

...and pummels him with his fist. A loud BANG and a 
flash of light from the end of the hall as someone 
fires a bullet at Wallace.
Instinctively, without thinking, he fires back, hitting 
the SHOOTER, who slumps to the ground. The impact of 
his first shooting washes over him. In that moment, 
the man beneath him pushes to his feet and begins 
running down the hall.

	              WALLACE
	              
	STOP!

The man grabs for the dead shooter's gun, turns and 
takes a bullet from Wallace's Glock before he can 
squeeze off a shot. Wallace stands frozen. The smoke 
from his gun fills the tiny hallway. He tastes blood 
and realizes he bit through his lip.

INT: 142 CHRYSTIE BASEMENT ROOMS - LATER (DAY)

The place is now brightly lit as COPS and FORENSICS 
scour the area. Chen enters from the far end and pulls 
Wallace aside.

	              CHEN
	              
	What were you doing in here?

	              WALLACE
	              
	I came out of the diner on Pell Street and saw 
	some guy snatch a purse. I chased him into the 
	building, but I lost him inside. Then I heard 
	screaming from down here. I just stumbled into 
	it.

Chen stares at him as Ung and Deng approach from 
upstairs.

	              UNG
	              
	There's close to forty women here, all illegals. 
	And we found a storeroom with about a hundred 
	tapes.

	              DENG
	              
	And the landlord remembers the four Jane 
	Does we pulled outta the dumpsters as part of 
	the stable.

Ung extends his hand to Wallace.

	              UNG
	              
	Good job, Detective.

Chen eyes Wallace who takes Ung's hand.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Thanks, Junior.

Soon other COPS come over to give congratulations. 
The good wishes turn into applause as we

INT: POLICE HEADQUARTERS-DAY

The Mayor's LACKEY pins a commendation on Wallace 
in front of a room filled with POLICE and PRESS. 
Somewhere in the back, feeling a little bit proud, in 
spite of his suspicions, is Chen.

INT: JIMMY LOO'S -NIGHT
A good-sized crowd, including Ung and Wallace. Ung's 
gassed.

	              UNG
	              
	It's dick size.

	              CHEN
	              
	You think everything is dick size.

	              UNG
	              
	It is. White people believe all Asians got little 
	dicks. So you think that when an Asian chick 
	sees your pecker, she's going to think it's Mount 
	Saint Helens.

Chen and Wallace laugh.

	              UNG
	              
	It's true. And then you look at the tiny hands on 
	most Asian chicks and figure your weenie's 
	gonna look like a sewer pipe in her fist.

	              WALLACE
	              
	He's discovered our secret.

	              UNG
	              
	Well the joke's on you, cause this Chinaman's 
	hung like a...

	              CHEN
	              
	A gnat.

Chen and Wallace laugh at Ung.

	              UNG
	              
	You wanna see?!

Ung struggles to his feet.

	              CHEN &amp; WALLACE
	              
	No!

Wallace pulls Ung back into his seat.

	              WALLACE
	              
	On that note, it's time to head home. I'll see you 
	tomorrow.

	              CHEN
	              
	Eight sharp. We're going to pick up surveillance 
	on those guys you busted, find out which one's 
	the fed.

He nods and crosses to the door. Chen gets up and 
follows him to the door.

	              CHEN 
	                  
	Wallace.

The young cop stops. Chen stands before him.

	              CHEN
	              
	You did a lot for those women down there...You 
	did good work.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Thanks.

	              CHEN
	              
	But it was an accident. You're lucky you're not 
	dead. So don't you ever go off alone again.

Chen stares a hole in Wallace's head. The young cop 
nods and slips out the door.

11. A GIFT FOR WALLACE
----------------------

EXT: JIMMY LOO'S-CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

Wallace steps from the bar and begins walking north 
on Centre. He sees the subway entrance and steps 
from the curb when a green Mercedes pulls to a stop. 
Inside is Henry Lee.

	              LEE
	              
	Congratulations, Detective.

Uncomfortable, Wallace glances back at the bar.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Thanks. I've gotta...

	              LEE
	              
	You must allow me to buy you a drink.

	              WALLACE
	              
	I really... 

	              LEE
	              
	You did a great thing for the people of this 
	community...Let me thank you, as a show of 
	respect...please.

Lee unlocks the door as Wallace hears some cops 
exiting the bar. Rather than be seen he quickly ducks 
into the car.

INT: STAIRWELL-NIGHT

Chen climbs a rotted stairwell of the Ginza massage 
and approaches an unmarked door. He hesitates, then 
decides to knock. He sees an eye in the peephole. An 
old WOMAN, seventy plus, opens the door and he steps 
inside.

INT: GINZA MASSAGE - NIGHT

All is back to normal just days later. The welcome 
room is filled with young girls smoking. One of the 
girls is May.

The old Woman calls her over and Chen sees her eye is 
bruised. May leads him toward the back but halfway 
down the hall he stops. Chen turns to the old woman 
and says something in Cantonese. She nods and Chen 
hands her three hundred dollar bills. He then takes 
May gently by the arm and escorts her out of the 
apartment.

INT: UNDERGROUND SPA/MASSAGE ROOM - NIGHT

Lee and Wallace, wrapped in towels, sip champagne 
as they step from a steam room thick with humidity.

	              WALLACE
	              
	There's more of Chinatown below sea level than 
	above.

	              LEE
	              
	There's always more under the surface.

The two men are greeted by a pair of beautiful 
MASSEUSES. One guides Wallace to a massage table, 
the other takes Lee outside.

	              LEE
	              
	Enjoy.

Lee exits as Wallace's Masseuse motions for him to 
lie face down on the table. He hesitates, but 
eventually lies down.

	              WALLACE
	              
	(Cantonese)
	What's your name?

She "Shhh's" him...then removes Wallace's towel. He 
glances back, feeling awkward as she begins covering 
his naked body with oil.

Expertly, she glides her hands over his skin, 
massaging his muscles. He wants to stop her, but he 
doesn't. The Masseuse moves around, working his 
arms, legs, back and buttocks.

She then climbs on top of him, and using her weight, 
digs deeper into his muscles. Slight moans begin 
escaping from his lips. After a moment, she reaches 
over and dims the lights.

She removes her robe, covers her body with oil and 
glides herself slowly over Wallace's skin. His eyes 
move about, showing both his discomfort and 
enjoyment. She rubs her lips gently across his back to 
the base of his neck. She kisses his ear as her mouth 
moves  across his face. She turns him onto his back. 
He looks up into her eyes, knowing he should stop. But 
he can't. Yellow fever.

INT: CHEN'S APARTMENT-NIGHT

Chen leads May into the apartment. She stands 
awkwardly in the center of the room. He turns on the 
lamp he picked up at Phan's. When he turns she tries 
to kiss him...but he holds her back.

	              CHEN
	              
	No.

She looks at him, not sure why she's there. Neither is 
he. They stand awkwardly. After a moment, he 
crosses to the kitchen. He opens the fridge and 
removes a cellophane bag filled with fruit.
He takes a knife from a butcher block and expertly 
slices a blood orange, separating the rind, removing 
the seeds. He hands May a sculpted piece of the dark 
red fruit.

	              CHEN
	              
	(Cantonese)
	From home.

She takes it from him. Her eyes close as she tastes 
the fruit. For a short moment she is across the sea, 
sitting with her family.

Chen smiles, and digs more produce from the fridge. 
He then hands May another slice of blood orange and 
begins chopping the vegetables in perfect, even 
slices. He glances at May and sees a tear sliding down 
her cheek.

EXT: WALLACE'S BUILDING-SUNRISE
The sun barely peeks over the horizon as Wallace 
enters the apartment.

INT: WALLACE'S APARTMENT - SUNRISE
He moves slowly, wearing the all nighter across his 
face. He cuts across the living room, steps into the 
bathroom.

INT: WALLACE'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY
He stops in his tracks. Lying on the floor is his father, 
beaten to a pulp. For a moment we see genuine 
concern on Wallace's face.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Shit.

	              SEAN WALLACE
	              
	Tried to...Never made it.

His concern fades as he realizes his father's 
conscious. But he still kneels beside him and checks 
his injuries.

	              WALLACE
	              
	You gotta go to the hospital.

	              SEAN WALLACE
	              
	No time.

He starts coughing and a pile of blood seeps from his 
mouth.

	              WALLACE
	              
	You're bleeding inside.

	              SEAN WALLACE
	              
	Wouldn't be surprised...I need the money.

	              WALLACE
	              
	I don't have it. Not that kind.

	              SEAN WALLACE
	              
	How much?

	              WALLACE
	              
	A grand, maybe.

Wallace helps the big man up to his feet...but both 
collapse under the weight. They hit the floor heavy.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Shit....Come on, again.

Wallace starts to lift but Sean shakes him off.

	              SEAN WALLACE
	              
	Would you give it to me if you had it?

Wallace looks at his father.

	              WALLACE
	              
	I don't think so.

	              SEAN WALLACE
	              
	Fuckin honest, like your mother...Screw it then. 
	Might as well call the hospital.

Sean passes out. Wallace looks at his old man, then 
dials 911.

12. HEAVY TRAFFIC
-----------------

INT: APARTMENT BUILDING BAXTER, HALLWAY-DAY

Deng and Ung are coming out of apartment 5C as 
Wallace reaches the landing from the stairwell.

	              WALLACE
	              
	The Fed tip his hand yet?

	              UNG
	              
	If he has I haven't seen it.

	              DENG
	              
	Better get in there, he's startin to get pissed at 
	you.

	              WALLACE
	              
	What's new.

Deng and Ung move down the stairs as Wallace enters 
the room.

INT: APARTMENT 5C  - BAXTER STREET - DAY

The room's filled with surveillance equipment. Chen's 
at the window photographing the comings and goings 
across the street where Wallace busted the fed days 
before.

	              CHEN
	              
	You're late.

	              WALLACE
	              
	My father had a fall last night..I had to get him to 
	the hospital.

	              CHEN
	              
	Took all night to get him there?

	              WALLACE
	              
	He fell last night, I found him this morning in the 
	bathroom.

Chen looks at him suspiciously, then hands him the 
camera and touches Wallace's neck.

	              CHEN
	              
	Looks like he scratched you.

Wallace pulls away and positions himself at the 
window.

	              WALLACE
	              
	When I was carrying him.

	              CHEN
	              
	He alright?

	              WALLACE
	              
	Yeah.

Chen sits at a table and deals himself a hand of 
solitaire.

	              CHEN
	              
	He was a cop, right?

	              WALLACE
	              
	The two five.

	              CHEN
	              
	Tough beat. Is that why you're here? Prove 
	something to the old man?

	              WALLACE
	              
	Is that why you're here?

	              CHEN
	              
	My old man's dead. I don't have to prove anything  
	to anybody. How 'bout you?

	              WALLACE
	              
	Just to you I guess.

	              CHEN
	              
	That's for sure.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Why do you have to constantly bust my balls?

	              CHEN
	              
	I'm educating you while there's time.

Chen lights the smoke as Wallace feigns 
embarrassment.

	              WALLACE
	              
	You mean you care about me?...I don't know 
	what to say.

	              CHEN
	              
	Try nothing.

	              WALLACE
	              
	But I'm overwhelmed. This showing of emotion. 
	This outpouring of human kindness. The caring, 
	the warmth. Don't look at me, I think I'm crying.

Chen smiles in spite of himself as Wallace turns 
toward the window and spots two ASIANS stepping 
from a Lincoln, which drives away.

	              WALLACE
	              
	These two don't look like junkies.

He picks up the camera and starts snapping away. 
Chen crosses to the window, watches through a pair 
of binoculars.

	              CHEN
	              
	No, they don't. 

They watch the two youths enter the brownstone.

EXT: CRUMBLING BUILDING -DAY

...the two YOUTHS enter the brownstone.

INT: VACANT APARTMENT- BAXTER STREET - DAY

Chen puts down his binoculars.

	              CHEN (cont'd)
	              
	You get pictures?

	              WALLACE
	              
	Yeah.

Then suddenly, the unmistakable sound of 
automatic gunfire rings out from the building 
across the street. Wallace's camera freezes 
as the gun shots echo across the street.

	              CHEN
	              
	Shit.

Both men have guns drawn by the time they hit the 
door.

EXT: BAXTER STREET APARTMENT BUILDING-CONTINUOUS-
DAY

Chen and Wallace hit the pavement at the same 
moment the two Asian gangsters climb into the 
big Lincoln which immediately starts backing out 
of the alley.

	              CHEN
	              
	Police!

Asian gangster's #2's answer is a barrage of 
automatic gunfire. Chen responds with one neat 
shot through the windshield and into the driver's 
head.  Gangster#1 wastes no time pushing the 
dead driver out from behind the wheel before 
Chen and Wallace can reach the car and 
continues their getaway at warp speed.  Chen 
unloads his weapon at the fleeing car before 
turning and heading towards the Chevy while 
Wallace charges up a narrow passageway to cut 
the gangsters off. 

EXT: NARROW CHINATOWN  STREET (N.Y.) - DAY

Wallace comes flying out of the alley and into 
the street just in time to get off a few shots at 
the oncoming Lincoln which barrels right at him 
forcing him to jump onto a parked car at the 
last minute.  Chen races from the opposite 
direction hoping to block the Lincoln's path. 
Without hesitating, the gang car plows onto the 
sidewalk and escapes past the terrified 
pedestrians. Chen pulls a 180, Wallace hops in 
the passenger seat and the chase is on.

EXT: SECRET STREET (TOR) - DAY

Wallace and Chen in hot pursuit.

	              WALLACE
	              
	(in the radio)
	This is car seven in green sector, we're in 
	pursuit of a blue Lincoln Continental, Jersey 
	plates five, niner, five, alpha, alpha, zulu 
	travelling south on Park Row, subjects armed 
	and dangerous. Request road block units on 
	all lanes.

With Chen and Wallace closing in, Gangster #2 
unloads another burst of gunfire. One of the 
bullets punctures the windshield, grazes 
Wallace's ear, exploding the headrest behind 
him. Chen continues to catch up as the Lincoln 
makes a sharp left slipping through the cross 
traffic. The Chevy's not as lucky, as it gets 
clipped in the rear causing it to spin 90 degrees 
and slowing their pursuit.

EXT: PELL STREET (N.Y.) - DAY

The Lincoln moves fast down Pell  and  hangs a 
sharp right careening onto Bowery heading 
downtown.  Chen and Wallace struggle to keep 
up with pedestrians scattering in all directions.  
Just as the gangsters reach the first stoplight it 
turns green. They pull out into the oncoming lane 
cutting in front of the waiting traffic which is 
just starting to move. In order to stop them and 
pin the Chevy in, gangster#2 lets loose a 
barrage of gunfire which mows down the 
drivers of the first row of car, pinning the Chevy 
behind the bloody roadblock. The Lincoln takes 
off to the right. Chen backs  up, sees an opening 
to an alley parallel to the street and takes off 
down it  hoping to cut them off.

EXT: SPADINA ALLEY (TOR) - DAY

Chen and Wallace speed through the narrow 
pasageway checking through the periodic 
openings to Temperance Street trying to track 
the Lincoln.

	              WALLACE
	              
	There!

Chen floors it- comes flying out the end of the 
alley on to...

EXT: NARROW DOWNTOWN STREET (TOR) - DAY

Cars parked on both sides of the street.
Chen comes right up beside the Lincoln and tries 
to force it to a stop by pushing it up against the 
parked cars but the Lincoln just keeps charging, 
banging an opening through the cars and 
jumping onto the sidewalk knocking down a 
half-dozen pedestrians who can't get out of the 
way fast enough. Chen tracks alongside- 
gangster#2 spraying automatic fire at them, 
smashing out the windows of the parked cars. 
Chen and Wallace do their best to return fire. A 
delivery truck straddles the sidewalk in front of 
the Lincoln,  instead of slowing, they speed up 
and at the last moment crash through parked 
cars, forcing an opening for them to come back 
onto the street. The parked car they punched 
through now blocks the Chevy.  Rather than 
stop, Chen blasts onto the opposite sidewalk, 
pulls up next to the Lincoln while he and Wallace 
try to blow it out. Suddenly there's an elderly 
woman pulling her shopping basket in front of 
them who can't possibly get out of the way.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Yo,  Civilian!!

Chen jams on the brakes, slides through an 
opening of parked cars and follows the Lincoln 
around the corner to the left.

EXT: POST OFFICE ALLEY - DAY

Gangster #2 seeing the Chevy gaining on them, 
leans far out his passenger side window and 
sprays the Lincoln's tires just before a truck 
pulls out from a loading dock and sends the 
gangster's body flying through the air like a 
puppet. The Lincoln doesn't even slow. The Chevy 
spins uncontrollably, the front end smashing 
into the elevated lift of a meat truck, which cuts 
right through the windshield pinning Chen 
behind a collapsed steering column.
Both men, shaken, watch as the Lincoln heads 
for the end of the street, then suddenly pulls a 
smoky 180 and heads right back towards them.

	              WALLACE
	              
	What the hell is he doing?

The Lincoln drives straight at them with the now 
visible BLUE and WHITES tailing it in close pursuit.

	              CHEN
	              
	Shit.

Chen and Wallace try and climb from the Chevy. 
Wallace can. Chen can't.  He's trapped behind the 
wheel.

Chen looks at Wallace who stands beside the 
car.

	              CHEN
	              
	Go!

Chen begins firing at the Lincoln. Wallace looking 
between Chen and the fast approaching car,  
fires also. Chen's gun empties. Because of the 
chaos of the delivery trucks, the Lincoln has 
only one way out, and that is to crash straight 
through the disabled Chevy.

	              CHEN
	              
	I said go!

Chen empties his gun. Wallace refuses to leave 
him. The Lincoln is forty yards, thirty yards. It's 
engine is deafening.

	              CHEN
	               
	GO!!!

Wallace stays, firing everything he's got. Out of 
ammo, he quickly turns, dives back in the ca and 
grabs the shotgun from the back seat. Twenty yards, 
ten yards, he sees the face of the DRIVER when he 
gets lucky and a shotgun blast hits the gangster in 
the chest. The Lincoln spins out of control, twirling 
like crazy before it hits one of the trucks and 
explodes in flames. Wallace pulls Chen down as the 
fireball rolls just over their heads. Chen looks at 
Wallace as they sit up.


13. ENTER THE FEDS
------------------

INT: INTERROGATION ROOM TWO - DAY

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	Federal agent Ronald Ming is dead. Shot seven times 
	in the back and I'm thinking some scumbag in 
	the Fifteenth is responsible.

Chen insides are twisted in knots. Half of him wants 
to come clean, but the self preservation half knows 
to play it cool.

	              CHEN
	              
	Maybe some scumbag in the Bureau is responsible.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	And maybe I'm gonna grow a tree out of my dick.

	              CHEN
	              
	If anybody could.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	And you can bet your ass it'd be an Oak.

Schabacker stares at Chen looking for the slightest 
flinch.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	We I.D'd the shooters...They're Fukienese.

Chen breathes a touch easier. Maybe it wasn't Lee. 
Maybe it was part of the turf war.

	              CHEN
	              
	Fuke's have been makin a move on the triads for 
	months.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	That's the only thing keepin me from ripping 
	this fuckin precinct to the ground. That...and this.

Schabacker puts a small tape on the desk. Chen looks 
at tape, wondering if he's on it.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	The assholes were in such a hurry to get moving  
	they didn't check the bodies for wires.

	              CHEN
	              
	Who's on it?

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	Benny Wong. Some others. Three weeks worth of 
	undercover work.

	              CHEN
	              
	A court'll never admit it without the agent backin 
	it up.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	They will once you tell 'em you've been working with 
	us on this investigation. That after the shooting 
	and before the chase, you entered the building, 
	approached our agent who, with his last breath, 
	told you he got this tape and corroborated what's 
	on it.

	              CHEN
	              
	That's perjury. Why would I do that?

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	To keep me from bringing charges against you for 
	obstructing a federal investigation. Wallace told 
	us how you engaged in the unauthorized surveillance 
	of a federal agent, which possibly blew his cover, 
	resulting in his assassination.

Chen looks at Schabacker.

	              CHEN
	              
	That speech may have shivered a rookie, but 
	you'll need better for me.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	Then I'll tell you what. You better watch your back 
	cause my gut's still tellin me somebody in the 
	Fifteenth gave my guy up and if I can't have Uncle 
	Benny, I'm gonna have him.

Chen looks into Schabacker's face.

INT: WALLACE'S APARTMENT-LATER

Wallace, dressed only in pants, cracks open the front 
door and sees Chen standing in the doorway. The visit 
catches Wallace off guard.

	              CHEN
	              
	You alone?

	              WALLACE
	              
	Yeah.

	              CHEN
	              
	Then invite me in.

Wallace opens the door wider and Chen steps inside. 
He looks around the small apartment filled with boxes 
and Chinese artifacts with cops eyes. The kind that 
make you nervous even if you've done nothing wrong.

	              CHEN 
	              
	You got something to drink?

	              WALLACE
	              
	(putting on his shirt)
	No.

	              CHEN
	              
	About yesterday. You saved my life out there.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Part of the job.

	              CHEN
	              
	Maybe. I still want to say thank you.

	              WALLACE
	              
	You know what it means I saved your life.

Chen smiles as he causually but carefully looks 
through the papers on Wallace's coffee table.

	              CHEN
	              
	This is America, it doesn't mean anything. 
	That said...Feds got you nervous?

	              WALLACE
	              
	No.

	              CHEN
	              
	Good. Cause whether it's the Feds, Internal 
	Affairs, whoever, the inside of a cop car is 
	sacred. You don't tell them what we do 
	unless you discuss it with me first.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Why the sudden paranoia?

	              CHEN
	              
	I'm just sayin'. Anybody asks you a question. 
	You ask me first.

Chen crosses to Wallace and stands face to face with 
him, making his point clear.

	              CHEN (cont'd)
	              
	No more talking with the Feds until we're 
	working off the same page. 
	Understood?

	              WALLACE
	              
	Yeah...sure.

	              CHEN
	              
	Good.

Chen turns and walks out the door. Wallace lets out a 
breath.

EXT: THE TOMBS-DAY

New York's city prison and holding facility. Like any 
toilet, it's filled with shit.

INT: THE TOMBS - INTERROGATION ROOM 
Sitting behind a desk is Chen. The Guards put Jack in a 
chair then step back into the hall. Chen eyes the kid 
who looks even smaller in his prison rags. He waits a 
moment, then puts a surveillance photo of Jack's 
girlfriend Amy San on the table between them.

	              CHEN
	              
	Nice looking girl. Did you know she's in the country 
	illegally?

Jack looks from the picture to Chen.

	              CHEN
	              
	Gonna have to send her back...after a little 
	jail time of course. Shame you two'll never 
	see each other again.

Jack's toughness is gone.

	              JACK
	              
	You can't send her, she's in trouble there. 
	She'll be...

	              CHEN
	              
	Too bad. I can't help you. That's what you told me 
	isn't it?

Jack feels the noose closing around his neck. He 
doesn't have much choice. He speaks quietly, already 
afraid of what he has to do.

	              JACK
	              
	I help you, when they move me, she come too, 
	with papers?

Chen nods, then places a small tape recorder on the 
table. Jack looks at it like it was poison. Chen then 
puts a business card beside it.

	              CHEN
	              
	My pager number. Punch one one after your number 
	so I know it's you.

Jack reaches for the card and recorder. When he 
does, Chen grabs his wrist and pulls him closer.

	              CHEN (cont'd)
	              
	I get you out, you better not run on me.

Jack looks at Chen and knows he's serious.

	              CHEN (cont'd)
	              
	I want to know who shot that undercover Fed. 
	And I want to know if whoever it was talks to 
	Henry Lee

Chen lets go of Jack and motions to the Guards. They 
reenter the room, pick up Jack and take him back to 
his cell. Chen watches him go and it's clear he doesn't 
feel good about what he just did.

EXT: CHEN'S APARTMENT, MOTT STREET - DAY

A truck filled with dead pigs hanging on hooks, stands 
on the corner. MEN carry said swine to small vans 
parked at the curb.

Chen, carrying groceries, walks past the workmen 
and up to his door. He glances toward the vans as he 
slides in his key.

INT: CHEN'S APARTMENT, MOTT STREET - DAY

Chen, still struggling with the death of the 
undercover agent, plops the package on the table, 
takes out a bottle of Bacardi and cracks the seal. He 
pours a portion of it into a half empty liter of Coke 
and hits it as he crosses to the window.

EXT: CHEN'S APARTMENT - POV MEAT VANS - DAY

He looks at the meat vans.

INT: CHEN'S APARTMENT, MOTT STREET - DAY

He picks up the phone and punches in a number.

	              VOICE (PHONE)
	              
	New York Times.

	              CHEN
	              
	I just called to tell you that Pete Schabacker of 
	the F.B.I. is a hemorrhoid-licking asshole.

	              VOICE (PHONE)
	              
	Excuse me?

Chen hangs up, sips his muscled Big Gulp and finally 
has something to laugh about.

INT: MEAT VAN, MOTT STREET-DAY

Tucked inside one of the meat vans, is a reel-to-reel 
recorder, Pete Schabacker and two hysterical AGENTS.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	Shut the fuck up.

14. HENRY'S DEAL
----------------

INT: HOSPITAL, SEAN WALLACE'S ROOM-DAY

Wallace moves past the other patients to his father's 
bed where the big Irishman lies with his eyes closed. 
Wallace looks down at him, then starts to leave.

	              SEAN WALLACE (O.S.)
	              
	Hey.

Wallace turns back to the bed. His father smiles at 
him.

	              SEAN WALLACE
	              
	Thank you.

Wallace isn't sure what he's talking about.

	              SEAN WALLACE
	              
	For the money. They sent a guy, he told me you 
	settled up. I'm not gonna forget it.

INT: LEE'S OFFICE-NIGHT
Lee sits behind his desk when Wallace storms into the 
room.

	Did you cover my father?

	              LEE
	              
	I'm helping you because I want you to help me.

	              WALLACE
	              
	No way.

	              LEE
	              
	My business is victimless. I supply services people 
	want and are forbidden to them by politicians. 
	However, you've seen there're those whose 
	business is not victimless. Whose tactic is violence. 
	I can help you rid Chinatown of those elements, and 
	help keep your father alive. All I ask, is that you 
	look out for my interests in return.

	              WALLACE
	              
	You're asking for more than that.

	              LEE
	              
	Long after you and I are gone there will be 
	gambling in Chinatown. There will be men willing 
	to pay a woman for her favors. And the police will 
	always be the last to know. That's a fact...Now 
	you can chase your tail in the dark and accomplish 
	nothing, or you can really do some good. For the 
	people of Chinatown, for your career and for your 
	father.

Lee circles his table and approaches Wallace.

	              LEE
	              
	Think of how many more young girls would have 
	ended up in dumpsters if not for your acceptance  
	of my help.

Wallace does think about it. Knowing that they did 
save lives. He looks out the window at a bustling 
Chinatown.

	              LEE
	              
	This isn't America, Danny. It's Chinatown.

	              LEE
	              
	Do we agree?...Or do you want me to call the 
	Italians and rescind my offer? Let them deal 
	with your father. 

The moment of choice. Its consequences are not lost 
on Wallace. The decision is not easy...but slowly, he 
shakes his head.

	              LEE
	              
	Good. There's something I'd like you to do for me 
	tomorrow.

Lee doesn't speak right away. He makes Wallace wait.

	              LEE
	              
	There's a tin shop on Hogan.

EXT: TIN SHOP - HOGAN STREET - MORNING(DAY)

Wallace steps from the subway, crosses to a 
newsstand, buys a paper and checks the timepiece 
hanging over the porn mags. 5:58AM.

	              LEE (V.O.)
	              
	A Malaysian runs it. Tomorrow at six AM, he'll 
	be receiving two bricks of heroin from a Colombian.
	He clocks the tin shop. He can make out the 
	MALAYSIAN guy behind the counter and a MALE 
	CUSTOMER, Chinese, checking the racks.

	              LEE (V.O.)
	              
	These men are scum, they deal to children. I'd like 
	you to stop them. He takes position at the bus stop 
	on the corner and waits. He sees an HISPANIC MALE, 
	40's, enter the store. The Malaysian locks the front 
	door and leads the Hispanic to the rear of the shop.

He moves quickly across Hogan. He reaches the front 
door, slides the slim jim from his jacket, and easily 
opens the lock.

INT: TIN SHOP - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Wallace pulls the Glock from his holster. He hears 
voices from behind the rear door. Cold sweat runs 
down his neck as he takes position. He steadies 
himself, then kicks open the door.

INT: TIN SHOP, OFFICE - DAY

	              WALLACE
	              
	POLICE! NOBODY MOVE!

He aims his gun and nearly fires when he hears 
YELLING from one of the men and sees the barrel of a 
.45 pointed at his face.

But he doesn't shoot because the gun belongs to 
Chen, in the middle of busting the two drug dealers.
Eyes wild and still YELLING, Chen nearly squeezes the 
trigger himself, but his brain registers Wallace faster 
than his finger.

The two cops, breathing hard, stare at each other 
knowing exactly how the other got there. After a 
moment, Chen cuffs the two prisoners to the radiator 
and pushes Wallace back into the store.

INT: TIN SHOP - DAY

	              CHEN
	              
	You son of a bitch. When did Lee approach you?! 
	The bust on Chrystie, right? The porn operation?

	              WALLACE
	              
	Yeah.

	              CHEN
	              
	I knew it. I knew your story was full of shit.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Well here you are. When did he approach you? I bet 
	quite a while before that. When was it, two years 
	ago, five years? How long have you been working 
	for him? Or can't you even remember?!

Chen grabs Wallace by the neck.

	              CHEN
	              
	You're dead. Your life is over. I thought you were 
	smart. You're not, you're as dumb as they come.

Chen lets go of Wallace. It takes a moment and then 
it hits him.

	              WALLACE
	              
	You gave him the Fed didn't you?

Chen looks back at Wallace.

	              WALLACE
	              
	That's why we were watching them. That's why 
	you pressed that kid so hard to wear a wire. Yeah 
	I heard about that. You want to see if it was the 
	Fukes who killed the agent or if it was Lee.

They hear something behind them and turn with guns 
pointed at a seventy year old Woman stepping 
through the door.

15. PLUMS AND PEACHES
---------------------

INT: GAMBLING PARLOR-DAY

Chen moves purposefully through the crowded room 
but he doesn't stop to play. Instead he strides up to 
Henry Lee, grabs him and forcefully pushes him down 
the hall and out into the back alley.

INT: GAMBLING PARLOR, STAIRWAY - DAY

He punches Lee to the floor. Lee's Sumo and two other 
triad SOLDIERS race into the room, guns drawn, but 
hold back from firing because Chen's gun is pointed at 
Lee's head.

	              CHEN
	              
	We had a deal.

	              LEE
	              
	You brought him in, not me. I couldn't risk it.

	              CHEN
	              
	I had him under control.

	              LEE
	              
	Says you.

	              CHEN
	              
	Let him go.

	              LEE
	              
	What's done is done. You know that better than 
	anyone. You want to help him? Smarten him up. 
	Make sure he doesn't trip over his toes and fuck 
	both of you. I hear dirty cops have an extra rough 
	time of it in prison.

Chen looks right into Lee's eyes.

	              CHEN
	              
	I find out you killed that Fed, I'll kill you.

Chen strides from the room, keeping his gun pointed 
on target.

EXT: SECOND STREET- DAY

Chen and Wallace move across the street. The mood is 
solemn. 

	              CHEN
	              
	Wires. You never know who's wearin one so 
	assume everyone is.

Chen stops at an outdoor fruit stand and samples the goods.

	              CHEN (cont'd)
	              
	Another thing. If you hear something in the precinct 
	you think we should pass along, always double 
	check. It could be a bogus tip they wanted you to 
	hear to see if it got passed along. Black or red plum?

	              WALLACE
	              
	I don't like plums.

	              CHEN
	              
	You don't like plums?

	              WALLACE
	              
	I like peaches.

	              CHEN
	              
	Peaches are shit. Didn't you ever hear that song 
	Sinatra sang, "Out of the tree of life I just picked 
	me a plum?"

	              WALLACE
	              
	I don't care if he picked a raisin out of Sammy Davis' 
	eye socket. I like peaches.

	              CHEN
	              
	Then I'm not paying for it. Chen pays for his plum and 		
	Wallace pays for his peach. Chen stops to watch a bunch 
	of KIDS playing soccer in the park.

	              WALLACE
	              
	How'd they get to you?

	              CHEN
	              
	I was the first Chinese cop in the Fifteenth. 
	Thought I was gonna clean up Chinatown. But 
	white cops wouldn't work with me and the 
	people wouldn't talk to a cop, Chinese or not. Only 
	Uncle Benny paid me any attention. He became my 
	godfather,  took care of my debts. Henry Lee was 
	his lieutenant. He fed me a few busts, made me 
	look good and I liked it. Then one night my father 
	walks into a gambling house and ends up dead. 
	Turns out Lee knew there was a contract on him. 
	Made it clear he could've told me, I could've 
	stopped it...Got me thinking I was better at 
	my job with him, than without him.

The soccer ball rolls over and Chen kicks it back into 
the game.

	              CHEN (cont'd)
	              
	And he was right.

Chen takes a bite from his plum as the sound of a 
shutter on a 35mm camera clicking stops the action in 
beautiful black and white. Suddenly, a hand reaches in 
and pulls the photo off the wall.

16. BENNY WONG CUTS A DEAL
--------------------------

INT: FBI HEADQUARTERS HALLWAY -DAY.

Schacker walks briskly through the hallway carrying 
the picture and talking on a cordless mouthpiece.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	It's Schabacker. I want everything you have on a 
	Detective in the Fifteenth Precinct. His name is Daniel 
	Wallace...Yeah his old man worked crooked outta the 
	two five, check on him too.

He rounds a corner and approaches his office where 
Benny Wong his lawyer and two Fed minions sit 
waiting for him.

INT: SCHABACKER'S OFFICE

He enters, closing the door behind him.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	Mr. Wong, we're running a one day sale. Chance of 
	a lifetime. The opportunity to buy your freedom.

Schabacker pulls an audio tape from his desk drawer.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	This tape was obtained by an agent working 
	undercover inside the Triad.

It's Cantonese but the look on Wong's face tells us it 
isn't good.

	              LAWYER
	              
	The tape is garbage. If it weren't, you would have 
	arrested my client by now.

Schabacker lays an arrest warrant on the table and 
speaks to Wong.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	Lawyers are always gutsy when it's someone else 
	looking at life. But I don't want you. I want whoever 
	killed my agent. I want the cops in the Fifteenth on 
	your payroll. And I'm willing to pay for it.

INT: FUKIENESE CRASH PAD, BEDROOM - NIGHT

The phone rings as Bobby Vu makes out with a good 
looking girl.

	              BOBBY VU
	              
	Hello.

INT: GREEN MERCEDES-SAME NIGHT

Lee rides in back, speaking into his cell-phone.

	              LEE
	              
	Our patience has paid off. Uncle Benny paid a visit to 
	the F.B.I. His time is over.

INT: FUKIENESE CRASH PAD, LIVING ROOM-SAME NIGHT

The room looks like home to seven teenagers who 
drink, do drugs, fight and play with guns all day. Four 
of them, including Jack, are on the couch, watching 
porno. The bedroom door opens and Bobby Vu enters, 
kicking everybody off the couches.

	              BOBBY VU
	              
	(Fukienese)
	Get dressed, we have a job.

	              JACK
	              
	(Fukienese)
	What is it?

	              BOBBY VU
	              
	(Fukienese)
	We take care of Benny Wong tonight.

EXT: CHEN'S APARTMENT, MOTT STREET-NIGHT

Wallace drives to the curb as Chen looks at the Phone 
Company truck parked across the street.

	              CHEN
	              
	My friends are waiting for me.

Wallace glances at the truck.

	              WALLACE
	              
	How long you think the Feds'll be watching us.

	              CHEN
	              
	Month, maybe two.

Chen can see that fact rattles Wallace.

	              CHEN
	              
	I didn't want Lee involving you.

	              WALLACE
	              
	It's not your fault.

	              CHEN
	              
	I didn't say it was. What I'm saying is you're 
	alone now. You can't trust anybody in the 
	department. Not the guys in the Fifteenth, not 
	the guys in the AGU. And you sure as hell can't 
	trust Henry Lee. So if anything gets sticky, you 
	come to me.

	              WALLACE
	              
	How do I know I can trust you?

	              CHEN
	              
	You don't.

Chen opens the car door.

	              WALLACE
	              
	I'm glad it's not just me...Nuts huh?

Half of him feels the same way...But the smarter half, 
the self preservation half, doesn't.

	              CHEN
	              
	No.

	              WALLACE
	              
	You wanna eat? I'll buy you a plum.

Chen smiles. He wants to, but he closes the door.

	              CHEN
	              
	I got plans.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Some other time.

Wallace drives off as Chen turns and pushes into his 
building. 

INT: CHEN'S BUILDING, HALLWAY OUTSIDE HIS 
APARTMENT-NIGHT

Lying against the door, cold and pasty white, is May. 
Chen quickly  checks her vitals, then lifts her in his 
arms and carries her back outside.

EXT: GAS STATION, QUEENS-NIGHT

The Fukienese crew sit packed into a stolen Buick 
Regal as one of the boys pumps unleaded into the 
tank. Jack in the middle of the back seat fidgets like 
an inmate on death row.

	              JACK
	              
	(Fukienese)
	I gotta take a leak.

Bobby Vu looks at him with the impatience of a killer.

	              BOBBY VU
	              
	(Fukienese)
	Hurry up.

Jack climbs out the door. He crosses the forty yards 
of asphalt and moves behind the filling station to the 
side of the building.

EXT: GAS STATION PAYPHONE - NIGHT

He stops at a payphone nestled between the men's 
and lady's rooms. His hands tremble as he slides in 
the quarter and dials the number off Chen's card. He 
checks the number of the phone, punches it in along 
with his code. He hits the pound key, hangs up and 
waits.

INT: HUDSON ST CLINIC: HOSPITAL ROOM -NIGHT

The population, STAFF and CLIENTELE, is mostly Asian, 
Spanish, and poor. The pace is fast and the care 
minimal by necessity.

Behind a curtain, May lies sleeping, I.V. tubing 
supplying nutrition, an oxygen mask supplying life. 
Chen watches her when his pager goes off. He checks 
the number, recognizing the pager code he gave Jack 
as a young DOCTOR enters the area.

	              DOCTOR
	              
	She's lucky you found her.

	              CHEN
	              
	I want you to write her up as deceased.

	              DOCTOR
	              
	Nick.

	              CHEN
	              
	She recovers, she goes to work. Two weeks 
	she's back here, maybe not so lucky.

	              DOCTOR
	              
	You're asking a lot.

Chen reaches into his pocket and pulls out ten 
hundred dollar bills. The Doctor thinks, then takes the 
money.

	              CHEN
	              
	Let her stay a few days, till she's stronger. 
	Then I'll come get her.

Chen looks at May then slips outside.

EXT: GAS STATION, PAYPHONE- NIGHT

	              BOBBY VU (O.S.)
	              
	(Fukienese)
	What the fuck are you doing?

Jack spins and calls on every ounce of strength he 
has to keep from turning white.

	              JACK
	              
	(Fukienese)
	I'm sick. I wasn't sure if I had to go back inside 
	or not.

Bobby Vu starts to smile...until the phone rings. Then 
he just stares at Jack, who ignores the ringing phone.

	              JACK
	              
	I'm alright. Let's go.

Bobby stops him...and picks up the phone. He puts the 
receiver to his ear, but doesn't say a word.

INT: HUDSON STREET CLINIC-SAME (NIGHT)

Chen stands at a payphone and almost speaks, but 
the silence on the other end of the line stops him.

EXT: GAS STATION, PAYPHONE-NIGHT

Jack's legs nearly buckle as Bobby Vu keeps the 
phone to his ear. The wait is agony, but gets 
interrupted when Black Eyes walks up.

	              GANGSTER
	              
	What're you doing?

INT: HUDSON STREET CLINIC-NIGHT

Chen hears the voices through the phone line and 
realizes something's not right.

	              CHEN
	              
	Is this Domino's Pizza?

EXT: GAS STATION, PAYPHONE-NIGHT

Jack continues to watch Bobby Vu, who hangs up 
without saying a word. Slowly, a smile curls his lips.

	              BOBBY VU
	              
	(Fukienese)
	Jack thought he was gonna shit his pants.

He puts an arm around his soldier and leads him to 
the Buick.

INT: HUDSON STREET CLINIC-NIGHT

Chen hangs up the phone. He stands a moment, then 
takes a pen from his pocket and writes down the 
number on the pager.

EXT: BENNY WONG'S HOUSE, FLUSHING QUEENS-NIGHT

Chinatown Two and definitely the nicest. An upper 
income, suburban neighborhood populated by 
American-born Chinese.

Out front of the gated corner house is the Bobby Vu's 
car. The Fukeniese fan out around the walls 
surrounding the property.

INT: BENNY WONG'S BEDROOM-NIGHT

Benny Wong sits in a club chair watching an episode 
of Sinbad when he hears the KRAK KRAK KRAK of 
gunfire coming from inside his house. 

He quickly searches his desk drawer finding a .38 
caliber pistol. He turns toward the door and freezes 
as he looks into the eyes of Bobby Vu and the other 
three Fukienese who point submachine guns at his 
chest. Bobby Vu smiles....Benny Wong stares at him.

	              BENNY WONG
	              
	You're not man enough to kill me.

In a flash, Benny brings the revolver to his temple 
and shoots himself. Bobby Vu looks at the old man 
lying dead.

	              BOBBY VU
	              
	We kill you anyway.

The four youths open up, turning Benny Wong into 
hamburger.

INT: BENNY WONG'S BATHROOM-NIGHT

The door opens and Bobby Vu enters. He lifts the lid 
and begins to pee unaware of MRS. WONG who lies 
paralyzed with fear in the bathtub. 

She tries to lie quietly as he unzips his pants. The 
sound of liquid hitting liquid mixes with the faint cry 
of police sirens in the distance.

He finishes, takes one step toward the exit then turns 
and begins firing into the glass shower door. He stops. 
Walks through the smoke filled room and stands over 
Mrs. Wong, alive, but cut to pieces in the bottom of 
the tub. He looks down at her and nonchalantly points 
his gun at her chest. She begins to cry as he pulls the 
trigger.

17. A LITTLE HELP FROM NICK
---------------------------

EXT: WORTH STREET-DAY

HENRY LEE stands outside his restaurant greeting 
people who pay respects to him as though it were a 
coronation.

Ung, Wallace and Chen buy frozen ices from a street 
cart trying to make a buck in the ninety degree heat.

	              WALLACE
	              
	You been able to reach Jack yet?

Chen shakes his head.

	              CHEN
	              
	Paged him fifty times and nothing. He's hidin.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Think he was calling about the hit?

	              CHEN
	              
	He was on it.

Wallace looks at all the people greeting Lee.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Nobody seems too upset.

	              CHEN
	              
	Except them.

Across the way, they see an FBI surveillance VAN.

	              UNG
	              
	Fuckin Feds...Dumb shit brings Benny Wong into 
	the federal building, should've just taken an ad 
	out in the papers.

They suck on their freeze bars when Chen notices 
three little CHINESE kids looking at the ice cream. 
Chen looks at the kids.

	              CHEN
	              
	You stay in school?

The kids nod. Chen hands the vendor a ten.

	              CHEN
	              
	Set 'em up.

The youngsters clamor for the ices.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Whatdaya think Lee's gonna do about the Fuke's 
	now that he's top dog?

	              CHEN
	              
	He's made his deal with the Fukes.

	              WALLACE
	              
	What are we going to do?

	              CHEN
	              
	I know what I want to do.

Chen stares at Lee with complete hate.

INT: FIFTEENTH PRECINCT, OUTSIDE THE AGU OFFICES-DAY

Through the glass door we see Wallace and Ung catch 
up on paperwork as Detective Deng comes through it, 
into the hall where the coffee machine sits. She pours 
black coffee into a thirty-ounce cup, then hits it with 
a half dozen sugars. Chen walks up.

	              CHEN
	              
	Planning on staying up for a month?
	
	              DENG 
	              
	Wait till you have a baby...Did you hear?

	              CHEN
	              
	Hear what?

	              DENG
	              
	I've heard the FEDS have a case against someone in 
	the Fifteenth.

This gets Chen's attention, but he tries to dismiss it.

	              CHEN
	              
	I've heard that every month for ten years.

Deng presses, like she's trying to tell Chen something 
more.

	              DENG
	              
	So have I, but this time I hear they have tapes, 
	photos, the whole nine yards. They're pissed off 
	about their agent and Benny Wong getting killed 
	and they want to hang somebody for it. 

Chen nods to his partner as she heads back to her 
desk. Chen thinks for a moment, then looks through 
the glass at Wallace working away.

INT: GAMBLING PARLOR-DAY

Chen enters the underground parlor. But today it's 
empty, except for Henry Lee, the Sumo, two other 
triad soldiers and the dealer from last nights 
gambling. Lee is here to collect his cut. His  minions 
immediately frisk Chen and take his guns from him.

	              CHEN
	              
	Think I have a reason to use them?

	              LEE
	              
	I'm not sure. Lately you've forgotten that what 
	happens to me, happens to you.

Lee makes sure Chen gets the message.

	              CHEN
	              
	The Feds are making a case against Wallace. We need 
	to cut him loose.

	              LEE
	              
	You're nervous. You're getting soft in your old age.

	              CHEN
	              
	The only thing going soft is your brain.

The Sumo smashes Chen into the wall and down to the 
ground.

	              LEE
	              
	Personal attacks are going to get us nowhere, 
	Detective.

Chen can barely breathe, let alone get to his feet.

	              LEE
	              
	But I'll tell you what. I'll take your advice to a 
	point. I'll sever any traceable ties between 
	us...and give Wallace a few arrests to knock the 
	shoo- flies off his heels.

Lee and his men start for the door, then stop.

	              LEE
	              
	I almost forgot in all this hub-bub.

He peels several bills from his takings and drops it on 
the floor.

	              LEE
	              
	Today's payday for dirty cops. Make sure you give 
	Wallace his cut.

He smiles and walks out the door. Chen, still on the 
ground, watches him go...then picks up the money.

EXT: FIFTEENTH PRECINCT-DAY

Chen walks up Elizabeth Street toward the station 
entrance when he sees Wallace hurrying out of the 
building.

	              CHEN
	Wallace.

The young cop either ignores the sound or didn't hear 
it, cause he heads straight for a patrol car parked at 
the back of the police lot. Chen yells after him.

	              CHEN
	              
	Where're you going?

Wallace stops, lets Chen catch up.

	              WALLACE
	              
	(making sure he's not overheard)
	Lee's not covering my old man with the 
	Italians. I gotta move him.

He starts towards his car.

	              CHEN
	              
	I told him to.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Why the hell'd you do that?

	              CHEN
	              
	Because the Feds are building a case against 
	you.

The words hit Wallace like a jack hammer.

	              WALLACE
	              
	How do you know?

	              CHEN
	              
	I know. And if they nab you it'll take three 
	seconds for you to give them me.

	              WALLACE
	              
	I wouldn't...

	              CHEN
	              
	Yes you would...And so would I.

Wallace turns away. Watches some cops heading off 
duty.

	              CHEN
	              
	I'm not saying it's fatal. Point now is to cover 
	tracks and keep everything clean on the 
	surface. And when they call you in, keep your 
	mouth shut.

	              WALLACE
	              
	I wish I never got into this.

Chen can't help feeling sorry for him.

	              CHEN
	              
	You and me both.

Chen reaches into his pocket and takes out the money 
he got from Lee, careful that no one sees him. He 
peels off several bills.

	              CHEN
	              
           This is your cut from Lee. 
           Three grand.

Wallace looks at Chen. He doesn't want to touch the 
money...but he needs it. So he slips it into his jacket.

	              WALLACE
	              
	I gotta get to the hospital.

	              CHEN
	              
	Where're you gonna move him?

	              WALLACE
	              
	I don't know.

Chen looks at him, then holds out the rest of the 
money.

	              CHEN
	              
	This'll cover your old man.

	              WALLACE
	              
	I can't.

	              CHEN
	              
	Just take it.

Wallace hesitates, but takes the money.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Thanks.

	              CHEN
	              
	Remember. Don't say anything. Let me deal with 
	the Feds. Alright? 

Wallace nods and heads for his car.

INT: AMY SAN'S BEDROOM, BROOKLYN-DAY

Jack and Amy watch TV when Chen breaks in the 
window beside them. Jack grabs for his gun but Chen 
pins his arm to the wall.

	              CHEN
	              
           Hard to find, Jack.

Chen grabs Jack's gun and slides it into his own belt.

	              CHEN
	              
	Tell her to take in a movie. 

Jack utters a few words in Fukienese and the young 
girl grabs her clothes and hurries out of the room.

	              JACK
	              
	I wanted to call. I couldn't.

	              CHEN
	              
	Now I'm here. So what did you want to tell me about 
	Benny Wong?

EXT: JACOBI HOSPITAL, BRONX-LATER (DAY)

Wallace stops in the no parking section in front of the 
clinic. He pops the "police tag" on the dash, gets out 
and heads inside.

EXT: JACOBI HOSPITAL STREET - DAY

Across the street, two FEDS snap photos of Wallace 
from a van.

INT: JACOBI HOSPITAL, BRONX- DAY

Wallace approaches the front desk when someone 
calls his name.

	              VOICE (O.S.)
	              
	Daniel Wallace.
	Wallace turns and sees the two Feds moving toward 
	him. He quickly hands the envelope to the RECEPTIONIST.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Would you pass this letter to my father in room 409? 
	Sean Wallace.

Before she can answer, the Feds are on him flashing 
badges as the larger Agent reaches for Wallace's gun.

	              WALLACE (cont'd)
	              
	Back off.

	              LARGE AGENT
	              
	Don't be an asshole.

He again reaches for Wallace's gun but Wallace 
pushes him off.

	              WALLACE
	              
	You don't touch my gun or my badge dipshit. I work 
	in the Fifteenth.

Wallace stares at the two agents.

	              SMALLER AGENT
	              
	Fine. Let's just get out of here quietly. There's a 
	couple questions we'd like to ask you.

Wallace continues to stare, then...

	              WALLACE
	              
	My father.

	              AGENT
	              
	We'll have someone on his door.

After a moment, Wallace turns to the flustered 
Receptionist holding the envelope.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Thank you.

He then walks toward the door with the two Feds 
behind him.

INT: AMY SAN'S BEDROOM, BROOKLYN-SAME (DAY)

Chen leans against the wall as Jack puts on his 
clothes.

	              CHEN
	              
	Then everybody split up?

	              JACK
	              
	Yeah.

	              CHEN
	              
	Good. You're under arrest.

	              JACK
	              
	What?!

Chen slaps on the cuffs and turns the kid around.

	              CHEN
	              
	You're gonna tell the Feds you've been working with 
	Wallace and me. That the hit on Benny Wong was 
	Fukienese and you're eager to testify against 
	Bobby Vu. Do it right and I'll back you on trying to 
	tip me before the hit. Do it wrong, I'll go out of my 
	way to bury you.

Chen hustles the kid out the door.

18. WALLACE'S SECRET
--------------------

INT: SCHABACKER'S OFFICE, FEDERAL BUILDING-DAY

Wallace sits alone in the office looking at the stack of 
photos depicting his actions over the past few days. 
He also sees photos of Chen with May. He looks at the 
young girl and recognizes her from the raid on the 
Ginza Massage.

He looks up as a pissed off Schabacker and  NYPD 
Internal Affairs Inspector Vince Kirpatrick enter the 
tiny room.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	Why the fuck didn't you tell me you were Internal 
	Affairs?

	              WALLACE
	              
	Confidential undercover assignment. The key word 
	being confidential. Which nothing in the Bureau is.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	Fuck you.

	              KIRPATRICK
	              
	Nobody knows except a few of us in IA. Not even 
	the commanding officer in the Fifteenth knows.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	Well now I know. 

Schabacker looks at Wallace.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	A bagman's kid, Internal Affairs. You're old man 
	must think you're a real scumbag.

	              WALLACE
	              
	I know what he thinks of Feds.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	Yeah, yeah. So what have you got on Chen?

	              WALLACE
	              
	This isn't a federal case. So there's no reason to 
	tell you anything.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	Yes, there is. Cause from where I'm sitting it looks 
	to me like a young, I.A. rat went under to build a case 
	against Nick Chen and ended up working for him.

	              KIRPATRICK
	              
	You're reaching.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	Enjoying for himself the Chinatown whores and a 
	little financial assistance to help with a family 
	gambling problem.

	              KIRPATRICK
	              
	Don't even start with that.

One of the arresting Agents enters the room.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	I'll start and finish with it unless somebody hands 
	me Chen.

	              AGENT
	              
	He's here.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	Who's here?

	              AGENT
	              
	Chen.

INT: CONFERENCE ROOM, FEDERAL BUILDING-CONTINUOUS (DAY)

Chen and Jack sit as Schabacker enters the room.

	              CHEN
	              
	Hello, Pete.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	Hello, Nick...Who's your friend?

	              CHEN
	              
	A snitch of Wallace's and mine. He's an eye witness 
	to the Benny Wong murder.

Schabacker sits back into his chair and offers Chen 
some nuts.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	Cashews?

They both sit, munching their nuts.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	Eye witness...And you brought him here to me? 
	Why?

	              CHEN
	              
	You know why.

The two cops sit looking at one another.

INT: SCHABACKER'S OFFICE, FEDERAL BUILDING-LATER (DAY)

The same crew as before sit when Schabacker re-enters.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	My compliments, Wallace. You must've sunk your 
	hooks into Chen pretty good.

	              WALLACE
	              
	What'd he want?

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	To trade for you.

	              KIRPATRICK
	              
	He said that?

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	Not in so many words. He brought that Fuke snitch 
	of yours who rode shotgun on the Benny Wong killing. 
	He gives me the eye witness, I call off the FBI 
	investigation on Wallace. Wallace feels more like a 
	shit as Schabacker talks.

	              KIRPATRICK
	              
	What'd you tell him?

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	I told him fine. We're puttin the kid on the 
	street to get the rest of the Fukes on tape talking 
	about the hit on Benny Wong. And in return, I'm 
	not going to press charges against young Wallace 
	here.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Is he still here?

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	He took off.

Schabacker leans back in his chair and smiles at 
Wallace.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	You gotta promise me I can be there when you 
	break the bad news to Chen. That's gonna be 
	priceless.

Wallace feels a heavy weight lay across his shoulders.

EXT: SOUTHERN MANHATTAN-NIGHT

Establishing. Clouds drift over the city making the 
familiar landmarks almost unrecognizable.

INT: WALLACE APARTMENT, BEDROOM-NIGHT

Wallace opens a safe box he has on the bed. Inside 
are audio tapes. Dates and names written across the 
labels. Chen's on most. Lee on others. He grabs a 
blank tape and pops it into a recorder.

He crosses to a mirror, opens his belt hides the 
recorder in his underpants. He buckles up and runs a 
wire up his chest. He gently tapes it to the inside of 
his shirt, then buttons up.

He tucks in the shirt tails and repositions the 
recorder. Finished, he stares at himself. Not liking 
what he sees.

	              SEAN WALLACE
	              
	Your wire's showin. 

Wallace turns and sees his father leaning against the 
doorway. Sean walks over and roughly fixes his son's 
shirt. Wallace pulls away and fixes it himself.

	              SEAN WALLACE
	              
	How long you been I.A.?

	              WALLACE
	              
	First assignment.

	              SEAN WALLACE
	              
	Quickest way to a gold shield.

Wallace doesn't say a word.

	              SEAN WALLACE
	              
	And all you've got to do is bury your partner. The guy 
	who shoved ten grand in your fist to back your play. 

Wallace looks at his father, wonders how he knows.

	              SEAN WALLACE (cont'd)
	              
	I figure you ain't worth much to the chinks yet, 
	so this must be Chen's money.

Wallace's lack of a response tells his father he's right.

	              SEAN WALLACE (cont'd)
	              
	And you're gonna bury him. And for what? Turning his 
	head and makin a few dollars.

	              WALLACE
	              
	I know that wouldn't mean much to you. Lyin and 
	cheatin are what you're made of.

	              SEAN WALLACE
	              
	And it's a hell of a lot better than what you're 
	made of.

	              WALLACE
	              
	You don't know what I'm made of. It's the one thing 
	I should thank you for, your lack of interest.

	              SEAN WALLACE
	              
	Yeah you've been real honest with your partner.

Wallace looks away from his father.

	              WALLACE
	              
	End justifies the means.

	              SEAN WALLACE
	              
	The end is bullshit. The means are what you live 
	with.

Sean reaches into his jacket, holds out Chen's money 
and tosses it on the floor.

	              SEAN WALLACE
	              
	Keep it. I don't want anything from you.

Sean Wallace turns out of the room. His son looks 
back in the mirror and does a last adjustment on his 
wire. 

He then reaches for the cologne on the dresser, 
splashes some into his palm and hurls the bottle 
against the wall.

INT: GAMBLING PARLOR - LATER (NIGHT)

The joint is packed. At a center table Chen is teaching 
Wallace and two beauties named KIM and TAI, the 
finer points of Pai Gou. One of the girl's got a hot hand 
and can't seem to make a wrong move.

	              CHEN
	              
	Unbelievable.

	              WALLACE
	              
	What are we doing here?

	              CHEN
	              
	Celebrating. You just got off death row.

INT: HOTEL SUITE - LATER (NIGHT)

The foursome slide into the dimly lit room with 
bottles of champagne in tow. Chen and Kim are 
already halfway to one of the bedrooms before 
Wallace has the door locked.

He turns and Tai has herself draped over him with her 
hands headed for his crotch. He holds her off, 
conscious of the recorder.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Wait, wait, wait.

She looks at him confused.

	              TAI
	              
	You don't like me?

Wallace looks at the beauty and kisses her full on the 
mouth.

	              WALLACE
	              
	I got to go to the bathroom first.

INT: HOTEL BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)

Wallace, drunk, locks the door behind him. He splashes 
water on his face, then glances up at himself in the 
mirror.

	              WALLACE
	              
	What the fuck're you doin?

He then takes off the wire and removes the recorder 
from his shorts. He takes off his jacket, puts the 
device in the inside pocket and rolls it up. 

INT: HOTEL LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

He heads back into the living room but Tai isn't there. 
He walks toward the bedroom and peeks inside.

INT: HOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT

Lying on the bed is Tai and Kim.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Where's Nick?

	              KIM
	              
	He left. He said he wanted you to be very happy.

She dims the lights. Wallace hesitates, then drops his 
jacket and walks toward the bed. He climbs between 
the women and closes his eyes.

19. THE SNARE IS SET
--------------------

EXT: PEARL STREET-NIGHT

Henry Lee and the Sumo move across the street and 
descend through a loading door in the sidewalk.

INT: BASEMENT-CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)

Lee and the Sumo reach a door and the Sumo knocks. 
Jack answers and lets them inside.

INT: FUKIENESE CRASH PAD - PEARL STREET - NIGHT

A dozen Fukienese are there, from Bobby Vu to the 
newest groupie.

	              LEE
	              
	The police are running in circles on the unfortunate 
	death of Uncle Benny. 

Jack tries to slowly position himself near Lee and 
Bobby Vu.

	              BOBBY VU
	              
	We want money. We didn't kill him for nothing.

	              LEE
	              
	It's time to bring the cargo ship to port and unload our 
	freight. One hundred eighty-six, at forty thousand a 
	piece. I'd say that's a nice start to our relationship, 
	wouldn't you?

INT: HOTEL, BEDROOM - MORNING (DAY)

Clock reads five AM. Wallace lies unconscious on the 
bed. Near the door, Kim takes the money from his 
wallet as Tai pulls the crumpled bills from his pants.
She grabs his jacket, unrolls it and checks every 
pocket. She stops when she hits the recorder.
They whisper intently to each other, then quickly 
return the recorder and the money to where they 
found them. Within seconds they're gone.

INT: CHEN'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - MORNING (DAY)

Chen carries a tray with soup and tea toward the bed 
where May rests.

	              CHEN
	              
	(Cantonese)
	How you feeling?

	              MAY
	              
	(Cantonese)
	Good.

Chen pours the tea and she reaches out to touch his 
hand.

	              MAY
	              
	(Cantonese)
	Thank you.

Chen looks at her, then hands her the cup. He watches 
her drink...then finally speaks.

	              CHEN
	              
	(Cantonese)
	You have family here, friends?

	              MAY
	              
	(Cantonese)
	No one. Everybody home...everybody.

Chen watches the tears fall from May's eyes as she 
drinks and thinks of home. 

INT: BENEVOLENT ASSOCIATION, LARGE OFFICE - MORNING 
(DAY)

Lee sits behind a large desk when Chen sits across 
from him.

	              CHEN
	              
	Only time I was ever in here I was talking to 
	Benny Wong.

	              LEE
	              
	He was a great man.

	              CHEN
	              
	You'd know better than anyone.

	              LEE
	              
	But even a great man can out last his time.

Chen studies Lee and lights a smoke.

	              LEE
	              
	I've got something for you. Should quiet any 
	doubts as to Wallace's character...The Fukes are 
	bringing in a highly valuable cargo by ship.

	              CHEN
	              
	That was a short partnership.

	              LEE
	              
	Bobby Vu will be on-site supervising the unloading. 
	Take the Fukes and half the shipment. I'll keep the 
	other half.

	              CHEN
	              
	You're getting greedy.

	              LEE
	              
	I'm an American.

INT: HOTEL BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

Clock reads 1pm. Wallace is still sleeping in the dark 
when sunlight explodes throughout the room with a 
WHOOSH!

	              CHEN
	              
	Let's go. We got to pick up Jack and deliver him to the 
	Feds.

	              WALLACE
	              
	What time is it?

	              CHEN
	              
	Time for a shower. You stink.

Chen lifts the mattress, spilling Wallace out of the 
bed. He then pops a cig into his mouth and checks his 
pants for a match...None.

	              CHEN
	              
	You got a match?

Chen picks up Wallace's jacket and reaches into one 
of the pockets. Wallace's eyes snap to attention as he 
quickly grabs a book of matches from the ashtray on 
the night stand.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Here.

He tosses the pack and Chen catches it. Wallace 
watches him drop the jacket to the floor. His heart 
skips when he hears a tink as the recorder hits the 
tile...Chen doesn't notice.

	              CHEN
	              
	You know you were right.

	              WALLACE
	              
	About what?

Wallace crosses over, picks up his clothes.

	              CHEN
	              
	I wish it was neither of us. But truth is, I'm glad it's 
	not just me.

Wallace looks at Chen, then heads for the bathroom.

INT: BLUE EMPRESS CAFE - AFTERNOON

Tai and Kim talk to the Sumo who's sullen expression 
grows darker. He hands each girl a c-note and 
disappears into the cafe.

INT: FEDERAL BUILDING, CONFERENCE ROOM-LATE 
AFTERNOON

Wallace, Chen and Jack sit waiting.

	              CHEN
	              
	You sure it was Henry Lee?

	              JACK
	              
	It was him.

Chen looks at Wallace as Schabacker and a middle-
aged WOMAN with short red hair enter the room.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	Everybody knows U.S. Attorney Margaret Wheeler?

	              MARGARET
	              
	The tape is good. Probably enough for convictions on 
	Bobby Vu and the rest. But I think we hold off until 
	they make their move to bring in the illegal 
	shipment. We bust 'em on the ship. Then we go for 
	the murder charge, the smuggling rap and with 
	Jack here connecting the dots to an ongoing criminal 
	enterprise, we meet our racketeering requirements 
	and get life sentences.

	              CHEN
	              
	What about Henry Lee?

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	What about him, Nick?

Wallace watches Schabacker play with Chen. He 
doesn't like it.

	              CHEN
	              
	Do we have a case, Pete?

	              MARGARET
	              
	There's enough to drag him before a grand jury, 
	but it's gonna be his word against their word 
	and he'll win. We wait till after the shipment 
	comes in, then the tape's got merit.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	What do you think, Danny?

Wallace looks at Schabacker, who's smiling through it 
all.

	              WALLACE
	              
	It's Margaret's call.

	              MARGARET
	              
	Then we wait. Everybody's on around the clock. 
	As soon as Jack finds out when delivery is set, 
	we'll reconvene and organize the arrest. Margaret 
	is first out of her seat.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	Nick...after we bust the Fukes, you, Danny and me 
	should get together... Bury the hatchet. What do you 
	think?

	              CHEN
	              
	I can't wait.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	Me neither. How 'bout you, Dan? You up for it?

Schabacker smiles at Wallace.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Sure.

Wallace pushes past Schabacker and strides out of 
the room.

20. NICK LEARNS THE TRUTH
-------------------------

INT: CROWN VICTORIA-DAY

Chen and Wallace cruise Chinatown in the big blue 
Ford. Both men drive without saying a word.

	              CHEN
	              
	What do you think about Lee?

	              WALLACE
	              
	I think if Jack's tape buries him it's his fault for 
	trying to be too smart for his own good.

	              CHEN
	              
	And how long you think it'll take him to trade for us?

	              WALLACE
	              
	You thirsty? I'm thirsty.

Wallace pulls the car in front of a fire hydrant and 
tosses the police tag on the dash.

INT: JIMMY LOO'S - CONTINUOUS DAY

Wallace and Chen pull up stools as the BARTENDER 
crosses over.

	              CHEN
	              
	Bacardi and Coke.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Bud. I'm buying.

Wallace puts his money on the bar. Both men seem to 
have something on their minds.

	              CHEN
	              
	I gave that Fed to Lee.

Wallace looks at Chen.

	              WALLACE
	              
	I know.

The bartender brings the drinks. Both wait for the 
man to move on.

	              CHEN
	              
	I'm gonna have to answer for him some day.

	              WALLACE
	              
	We all have something to answer for.

	              CHEN
	              
	Yeah.

They sit quietly...until Chen's pager goes off. He 
checks the number.

	              CHEN
	              
	Speak of the devil.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Lee?

	              CHEN
	              
	Yeah. Order me another.

Chen picks up his drink and crosses to the phone. He 
pumps in a quarter, dials and waits.

	              CHEN
	              
	It's Chen, get me Lee.

Chen finishes the drink as he waits.

	              LEE (PHONE)
	              
	Where've you been. I've been paging you all 
	morning.

	              CHEN
	              
	What do you want?

	              LEE (PHONE)
	              
	Wallace is Internal Affairs.

Chen feels his stomach tighten, but he's not sure he 
got it right.

	              CHEN
	              
	What?

	              LEE (PHONE)
	              
	You heard me.

	              CHEN
	              
	I don't believe it.

	              LEE (PHONE)
	              
	Your girlfriends found a wire on him last night. I 
	checked it out and the fuck is making a case 
	against you.

The words hit Chen like a freight train. He stands 
speechless. His insides reeling as he looks over at his 
partner.

	              LEE (PHONE)
	              
	You there?

	              CHEN
	              
	Yeah.

	              LEE (PHONE)
	              
	Who knows how long he was wired...He's got to go.
	Chen's breath grows heavy as his eyes stare vacantly 
	at Wallace, who's working a beer.

	              LEE (PHONE)
	              
	You kill him tonight.

Chen can't answer either way, he's not even sure if 
it's real or a dream.

	              LEE (PHONE)
	              
	The Fukes are taking delivery in one hour. Pier 
	25 at Port Imperial in Jersey, a ship called the 
	DORIAN. Take him along and make sure he doesn't 
	leave the boat...you understand me? I don't 
	give a shit about the cargo, the Fukes, nothing. 
	Just make sure Wallace is dead. Are we clear?
	Chen doesn't answer, he just keeps looking at 
	Wallace, who's looking back at him now.

	              LEE (PHONE)
	              
	He'll hang us both.

	              CHEN
	              
	Yeah. I understand.

	              LEE
	              
	Kill him.

Chen hangs up. He looks at Wallace, then pushes 
into...

INT: JIMMY LOO'S BATHROOM - DAY
He stands in the tiny room, half looking in the mirror, 
half looking nowhere. Eyes darting, mind racing.  He 
turns on the water and runs it across his face, but it 
doesn't really help.

He reaches for a hand towel but it's stuck in the 
dispenser. He rips down on the towel with all the 
rage, frustration and anger inside him, tearing the 
metal dispenser from the wall and slamming it into 
the sink, the wall and finally to the ground. He then 
tries to steady himself, but he's too upset. But then 
his pager goes off. He calms himself, checks the 
number...then dials. A voice answers.

	              CHEN
	              
	Jack...slow down...tonight, Pier 25, the Dorian. You did 
	good, Jack. Where are you?...No, I'll contact the 
	F.B.I. I want you to stay at your girlfriend's, don't talk 
	with anyone. After we pick up the others, I'll come for 
	you.

Chen hangs up. He takes a breath and looks at himself 
in the mirror. He runs his hands through his hair and 
slowly exits back into the bar.

INT: JIMMY LOO'S -DAY

His eyes stay on Wallace as he crosses the room. Only 
now they look like he wants to kill him right there. He 
sits beside his partner.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Get a hold of him?

Chen takes a healthy gulp from his new drink.

	              CHEN
	              
	Yeah.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Did you tell him about the tape?

	              CHEN
	              
	No.

	              WALLACE
	              
	What'd he want?

Chen looks directly into Wallace's eyes. It takes him a 
moment to get the words out of his throat.

	              CHEN
	              
	He wanted to tell me that the Fuke's are picking up 
	their shipment in an hour, in Jersey.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Shit, we gotta move. Did you call the Feds?

	              CHEN
	              
	Yeah. They're going to meet us there.

Chen finishes his drink and the two cops cross for the 
door.

21. THE SHIPYARD
----------------

EXT: PORT IMPERIAL, DOCK 25-DUSK

A huge container ship sits silently at dock. We 
focus closer on the Wheelhouse.

EXT: DOCK - NIGHT

Through night vision goggles we see the 
adjacent parking lot. All seems calm at the 
moment.

INT: WHEELHOUSE - NIGHT

Chen stands quietly in the darkness looking 
through the night vision goggles.

	              CHEN
	              
	No sign of anybody.

He turns and hands the goggles to Wallace.

	              CHEN (cont'd)
	              
	Have a look.

Wallace takes up the post as Chen steps back into the 
shadows.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Lee said an hour, right?

	              CHEN
	              
	Yeah...still nothin'?

	              WALLACE
	              
	Nope.

	              CHEN
	              
	You sure?

	              WALLACE
	              
	Yup...all clear.

There's a long pause. We watch Chen's face turn to 
stone.

	              CHEN
	              
	How about Internal Affairs?

Wallace flinches but covers.

	              WALLACE
	              
	What?

	              CHEN
	              
	I forgot to mention it. Lee thinks they're making a 
	case against someone in the fifteenth.

	              WALLACE
	              
	(while continuing looking through the goggles)
	Who?!

	              CHEN
	              
	He didn't know. Maybe it's just a rumour.  You hear 
	anything?
	
Wallace is about to answer when he sees a 
tractor trailer pull into the lot.

	              WALLACE
	              
	They're here. Take a look.

He turns to give the goggles to Chen.

	              CHEN
	              
	No- you keep watching. We've got to let 'em lead 
	us to the cargo.

EXT: CONTAINER SHIP - NIGHT

Through the goggles we Bobby Vu and the others 
be met by a shipman and led to the far end of 
the boat. 

	              WALLACE
	              
	They're heading away from us.

INT: WHEELHOUSE - NIGHT

Chen quietly cocks his gun and points it at the back of 
Wallace's head.

	              CHEN
	              
	What would you do if you knew I.A. had a case 
	against you? Would you run?

	              WALLACE 
	              
	(increasingly uncomfortable)
	I don't know what I'd do. What would you do?

Wallace is unaware of Chen standing directly 
behind him, sweat building on his face- ready to 
pull the trigger.

	              CHEN
	              
	You mean after I killed whoever ratted on me?

Wallace's blood turns to ice. He lowers the goggles, 
turns slowly and comes face to face with the barrel 
of Chen's gun. It's instantly clear Chen knows all.

	              CHEN
	              
	You should have let me die in the car that day. At 
	least then I die a cop.

	              WALLACE
	              
	You are a cop- a good cop. And I'll tell anyone who 
	asks.

Chen hesitates. Not sure what to believe.

	              CHEN
	              
	And you?

	              WALLACE
	              
	I don't know what I am. All I know is you saved me 
	and you saved my father. My life is really yours to 
	do with as you wish. 

His words hang heavy in the air...and then Chen fires. But 
not at Wallace. He fires past his head, through the glass 
of the wheel house and hits the FUKENESE gangster who 
was about to blow them away with an assault rifle. A 
beat, and automatic fire comes from another window, 
spraying the wheelhouse with hot metal. 

Wallace takes out the shooter as Chen flies out the door. 

Momentarily dazed, Wallace recovers, scrambles 
to his feet- looks around, but Chen has disappeared. 

INT/EXT: FUNNEL CHAMBER - NIGHT

Wallace enters slowly and traverses the three 
storey high metal grate walkways. WE HEAR only 
the clank of his feet as he descends deep into 
the ship.

INT: ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT

Chen moves stealthily passed the huge humming 
generators, slowly approaching each blind 
curve. HE HEARS what sounds like the distant cry 
of an infant. He keeps moving

VIDEO SURVEILLANCE P.O.V. - NIGHT

We see Chen move through the room towards 
the exit. An arm carrying an UZI passes in front 
of the camera.

INT: ANCHOR ROOM - NIGHT

Wallace cocks his ear to the same sound as he 
moves through the room dominated by the giant 
chains that connect to the lowered anchors. Just 
at that moment a Fuke moves out from behind 
the casing and gets off a shot that cuts right 
through Wallace's left hand. He yelps in pain as 
he takes cover, rips the sleeve of his shirt to 
stem the bleeding, then waits for the Fuke to 
make his move. He does- Wallace stands right up 
at him and takes him out in a fierce exchange.

INT: ENGINE ROOM FIRST FLOOR - NIGHT

The cavernous energy center of the ship. Four 
storey's high. A cacophony of the brute force of 
the engines and the steel walkways that 
encircle them.

Chen comes out on the bottom level. All seems 
quiet, except for what seems like the distant 
hum of human whispering. He moves slowly out 
into the open. The place seems empty until 
suddenly a shape appears on the metal catwalk 
two storey's above. He turns with lightening 
speed- points, ready to shoot at...Wallace.

There's a tense standoff. Neither wants to lower 
their weapon first. The sound of distant 
murmuring grows louder until suddenly the 
standoff is ended by a common enemy. Wallace 
whips around and sends a fuke who was about 
to shoot him flying back against a wall. Chen 
suddenly finds a Fuke charging down metal 
stairs towards him. He blasts him before he can 
get a shot off- the Fukes lifeless body 
toboganning down to land at Chen's feet. 

One holdout, BLACK EYES, equipped with an AK47 
on the top floor will not be taken out. Like some 
madman on crack he sprays crazily in every 
direction until finally Chen just goes for it 
stepping out into the open and pummeling BLACK 
EYES with bullets. A pipe behind the Fuke 
explodes with steam, enveloping Black eyes who 
falls limply onto a vertical crane. Chen and 
Wallace relax a beat and then BANG! Black Eyes 
is up and charging Wallace. Chen is faster, 
spraying him with everything left in his weapon, 
hitting and igniting a fuel pipe which spills out 
it's fiery liquid setting BLACK EYES aflame. The 
dying Fuke grabs onto some hanging rope and in 
a last defiant act, swings down the three 
storeys all the time firing and coming almost 
face to face with Chen before being finally 
silenced- his incinerated corpse landing at 
Chen's feet.

Wallace scans the area while he descends the 
stairs towards Chen. There are no Fukes in sight. 
The human murmuring grows louder. Without 
speaking, Chen and Wallace move towards the 
source of the sounds.

INT: PASSAGEWAY ANTEROOM - NIGHT

Chen and Wallace move slowly down the few 
steps to a heavy steel door beyond which the 
sounds seems to emanate. With silent gestures 
they work like the partners they've become. 
Wallace opening the door and stepping back, 
covering Chen as he makes his move.

INT: PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

Nothing could have prepared them for what they 
find on the other side of the door. There, as far 
as the eye can see, running the entire length of 
the ship, is the cargo Lee awarded the Fuke's. 
Several hundred illegal Chinese immigrants 
huddled together in unspeakable conditions, 
stuffed into a tiny opening that resemble's an 
endless train compartment. Their dark vacant 
eyes stare back at the shocked cops who move 
cautiously through the passageway. It doesn't 
take long for the remaining Fuke's to make their 
presence known with a bullet destined for Chen, 
and intercepted by the back of an innocent 
young male immigrant.

Chen, Wallace and the desperate group of 
illegals flatten themselves against the sides of 
the corridor. SILENCE

Chen steps out quickly as if to take a shot, but 
it's a sucker punch as he immediately tucks 
himself back in then out again just in time to 
duck the bullet from a Fuke and plant his own 
squarely in the gangster's chest.

Chen ducks back behind the steel separators 
that occur about every twenty feet in the 
passageway. Wallace is one "compartment" 
back. A young boy, no more than six years old, 
drifts out into harm's way. Wallace reaches out 
quickly and pulls him to his side. While Wallace 
keeps quard, the kid holds onto his hand and 
begins to sympathetically rub his bandage- his 
eyes pleading for salvation of any kind. Chen 
looks back sees this and Wallace's empathic 
reaction to pat the young kid on the head. Chen 
hesitates a second, then...

	              CHEN
	              
	(whisper)
	Wallace...

Wallace snaps to. Chen indicates for him to 
follow as he sprints out and moves quickly down 
the narrow tunnel past the endless collection of 
immigrant pawns. We see their desperation not 
only in their faces, but in their pathetic little 
bundles that contain all their worldly 
belongings. They mutter Cantonese pleas.

	              CHEN AND WALLACE
	              
	(Cantonese)
	Quiet...quiet.

They come to a stop. Listen a moment to the 
silence.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Maybe that's all of them.

	              CHEN
	              
	Bobby Vu's here, and he'll never leave without us.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Without you.

Wallace moves out quickly out into the 
passageway as if taunting Vu to make his move. 
He stops two compartments down. Chen is one 
compartment behind. They exchange looks. Chen 
indicates to "stay put".

Wallace peaks out from behind the steel. One of 
the oldest women in the hold, a grandmotherly 
face of China, motions for 
Wallace to come closer.

	              GRANDMOTHERLY TYPE
	              
	(Cantonese)
	Come here, boy. Come to me.

	              WALLACE
	              
	(Cantonese)
	What?

	              GRANDMOTHERLY TYPE
	              
	(Cantonese)
	I know where they are.
	
	              WALLACE
	              
	Where?

	              GRANDMOTHERLY TYPE
	              
	Come here.

Chen watches as Wallace moves out and 
approaches the woman. Suddenly the image 
goes into hyper slo-mo. We see the woman 
mouthing the Cantonese words for "come here". 
Back on Chen, there suddenly something wrong. 
He looks closely at the old woman, and then, 
operating purely on instinct, he races forward.

	              CHEN
	              
	NO!!!!!

Just as Wallace steps up to the woman, CHEN 
pushes Wallace aside and takes the automatic 
fire that Bobby Vu shoots from behind an 
innocent skirt. Wallace immediately raises his 
gun and fires two in the chest and one in the 
head. Just like Chen taught him. Bobby Vu's body 
hits the floor with a thud. Dead.

Wallace looks down at Chen as the blood begins 
spreading out around him. Quickly, he kneels 
beside his partner, gathers him in his arm and 
tries to control the bleeding, but the wound is 
deep. He turns toward a commotion at the 
entrance to the tunnel and sees a bunch of Feds 
and uniforms heading towards him.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Bring a stretcher!! (to Chen) Come on, hang on.

	              CHEN
	              
	Shit.

Chen tries to catch his breath, but he can't seem to.

	              WALLACE
	              
	You're alright. You're OK.

Chen's body spasms from the pain.

	              WALLACE
	              
	I'm sorry.

Chen grabs hold of Wallace's hand.

	              CHEN
	              
	Who sends a white cop undercover in Chinatown?

Wallace looks into Chen's eyes. He's fading in and out.

	              WALLACE
	              
	(leaning close)
	Nick...can ya hear me?

	              CHEN
	              
	(barely conscious)
	Mmmm...

	              WALLACE
	              
	Nick...it's just you and me...I'm your partner.

A tiny smile escapes from Chen just before he loses 
consciousness and is surrounded by an EMS team.

22. FINAL HONOR
---------------

INT: HOSPITAL CORRIDOR-DAY

Kirpatrick, a manila envelope in his hand, rushes down the hallway 
with Schabacker.

They hurry to the Intensive Care ward stopping outside a room where 
a uniformed OFFICER stands guard. Through the window in the door 
they can see Wallace leaning close to Chen who lies motionless in the 
bed.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	(to the OFFICER)
	Get Wallace out here.

The Officer doesn't move so Schabacker pulls out his FBI badge and 
shoves it close to the cops face.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	Now.

The Officer gets up slowly from his chair as the door swings open and 
Wallace exits from the room. He looks at the two men then starts 
down the hall when Kirpatrick slaps him across the chest with the 
manila envelope.

	              KIRPATRICK
	              
	What's this bullshit?

	              WALLACE
	              
	Exactly what it says. That after a month 
	long investigation, there's no evidence to 
	support any charges against Lt. Nicholas 
	Chen.

	              SCHABACKER
	              
	You think you can get away with this 
	forget it. He's responsible for the death of 
	a Federal Agent.

An ICU team races down the hall and charges into Chen's room.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Chen's dead.

Schabacker and Kirpatrick don't say a word.

	              WALLACE
	              
	And no matter what you believe, the 
	officer in that room died a good cop.

Wallace looks them in the eye, then pushes past them and continues 
down the hall.

INT: AMY SAN'S APARTMENT, BROOKLYN-DAY

Jack opens the door and sees Wallace standing in the doorway.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Time to take care of Henry Lee.

INT: BLUE EMPRESS CAFE-DAY

Lee sits at a table with a white, middle aged MAN in a pin striped suit. 
Wallace, Ung and Deng enter the restaurant.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Henry Lee, you're under arrest.

	              LEE
	              
	I'd like to introduce you to my attorney, Mr. Cotten.

	              UNG
	              
	I'd like to introduce you to the inmates at Riker's 
	Island, but that'll take a few weeks.

	              LEE
	              
	Your optimism is refreshing.

Lee gets up, along with his attorney. He turns to Wallace.

	              LEE
	              
	I was very saddened to hear about your friend, Lt. 
	Chen...Oh, I'm sorry, he wasn't your friend after all, 
	was he? Lee puts on his coat and leans close to 
	Wallace.

	              LEE
	              
	And I'd like to thank you for killing all the witnesses 
	against me.

He smiles.

	              WALLACE
	              
	Not all. Not the one who recorded this tape.

Wallace plays a short sample of Jack's tape and the smile fades from 
Lee's face...which makes Wallace smile as Deng and Ung lead Lee out 
in cuffs.

INT: CHEN'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - DAY

Wallace sits across from May. He slides an envelope in front of her.

	              WALLACE
	              
	(Cantonese)
	He wanted you to have this.

She opens the envelope. Inside is a "green card" clearly indicating 
"OFFICIAL U.S. RESIDENCY STATUS."

	              WALLACE
	              
	(Cantonese)
	And this.

Wallace takes out the envelope of money his father tossed on the 
floor and gives it to May who's eyes well with tears.

	              WALLACE
	              
	(Cantonese)
	You gonna be alright?

	              MAY
	              
	Yes...thank you.

She gets up and gives Wallace an appreciative kiss on the cheek.

EXT: ELIZABETH STREET-DAY

End credits roll as the NYPD honor and bury their own. In a funeral 
procession that draws on traditional Chinese culture as well as 
present day police decorum, the men and women who serve and 
protect parade down the small Chinatown street in full dress blues.
Banners depicting the face of Nick Chen wave out front as his coffin, 
draped in the American flag draws cheers from the people of 
Chinatown. And no one louder than Detective Daniel Wallace.
