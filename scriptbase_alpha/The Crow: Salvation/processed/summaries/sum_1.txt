18-year-old Alex Corvis is framed for the murder of his girlfriend Lauren Randall, who was stabbed 53 times.
Lauren was 18 years old.
Three years after the stabbing, 21-year-old Alex is executed in the electric chair for it.
Soon after the execution, Alex is resurrected by a legendary crow, so Alex can clear his name and get revenge.
Alex follows the crow to the Salt Lake City police department's evidence room, where he discovers that Lauren was killed by a group of corrupt cops, and Alex believes that one of the killers had an unusual scar on his arm.
Alex finds the knife that was used on Lauren, and then Alex finds Lauren's grave.
Alex also meets with Lauren's sister Erin, who does not believe who he is, but he tells her that he'll prove it somehow, then he disappears.
Alex finds Tommy Leonard, the man who was paid to lie about Alex at the trial.
Tommy tells Alex which cops killed Lauren -- Madden, Martin Toomey, Vince Erlich, Stan Roberts, and Phillip Dutton, and Alex spares Tommy's life.
It was Dutton who handled the investigation of Lauren's death.
Alex proves himself to Erin, and with Erin's help, Alex sets out to take down the corrupt cops who framed him.
