Pearl Harbor is a classic tale of romance set during a war that complicates everything.
It all starts when childhood friends Rafe and Danny become Army Air Corps pilots and meet Evelyn, a Navy nurse.
Rafe falls head over heels and next thing you know Evelyn and Rafe are hooking up.
Then Rafe volunteers to go fight in Britain and Evelyn and Danny get transferred to Pearl Harbor.
While Rafe is off fighting everything gets completely whack and next thing you know everybody is in the middle of an air raid we now know as "Pearl Harbor."
