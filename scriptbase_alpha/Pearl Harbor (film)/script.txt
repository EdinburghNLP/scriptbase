                          EARLY DRAFT








     Out of BLACK we hear the sound of an airplane roaring by.

     EXT.  POV OF AN AIRPLANE

     Flying over American heartland.  We see the earth through the
     pilot's perspective as sky and ground swap positions, the
     plane swooping down and storming over the ground.

     THE PLANE

     is a biplane, racing over a field lush with young plants.  It
     releases a trail of crop spray, and climbs again...

     Up into a crystalline blue sky where sunshine pours like
     honey over family farms stretching to the horizon.  Maybe
     it's not heaven, maybe it's just Tennessee.  But as long as
     there's been an America, men have fought and died for this
     place -- as volunteers.

     Far off, but visible from the plane is

     A BARN - DAY

     The barn is unpainted except for hand lettering that says
     "McCawley Crop Dusting." Another plane noise, this one made
     by kids, brings us to TWO BOYS, sitting in the shell of an
     old plane propped on crates, scavenged of it's engine, seats,
     and wheels.

     The boys sit in it's cockpit, butts crowded onto the nail keg
     they've replaced the seat with.  They've even attached a 2x4
     as propeller, as if their imaginations needed any help.  They
     wear overalls and have bowl haircuts:  RAFE and DANNY, 10
     years old.

                         RAFE
               Bandits at 2 o'clock.

                         DANNY
               Power dive!

     They buzz their lips in a flying noise and work the controls,
     Rafe's bare feet on one pedal, Danny's on the other.

                         RAFE
               It's Germans!

                         DANNY
               Kill the bastards!

     Rafe looks at Danny in shock -- then they both laugh and go
     right back into their game, manufacturing their own machine
     gun and engine sounds.

                         RAFE
               Good shooting, Danny!

                         DANNY
               Good shooting, Rafe!

                         RAFE
               Land of the free...

                         DANNY
               Home of the brave!

                         RAFE
               There's another one!

     Their vocal motors roar again... But a man's hand grabs Danny
     by the straps of his overalls and jerks him from the cockpit.

     It's Danny's FATHER and he's a fearsome sight; drunk, his
     hair uncombed, his face unshaven, his teeth -- those still
     left -- are rotting.  He's also missing an arm; but the one
     that's left is potent, and he's shaking Danny with it.

                         DANNY'S FATHER
               You no count boy!  Johnson come lookin',
               said he'd pay a dime for you to shovel
               his pig shed, and I can't find you no
               place.

                         DANNY
               Daddy, I told you I was comin' here.

     His father slaps him off his feet.  Rafe is so horrified he
     can't get a sound out.  Danny isn't even surprised.  But when
     his father snatches him up again, twisting the overall straps
     so tight they choke him, he struggles.  It does no good; his
     father starts marching across the field, dragging and
     strangling Danny.

                         DANNY
               Da!... Dad...

     The father's drunken anger makes him oblivious -- until
     CRACK!  The 2x4 propeller slams him across the back, knocking
     him to the ground and making him drop Danny.

     The father rolls over to see 10-year-old Rafe, holding the
     2x4 like a bat.

                         RAFE
               Let him alone!

     The father's eyes bulge in rage; he struggles to his feet.

                         DANNY
               Rafe... Daddy... No!

     The man looks murderous, but Rafe draws back the board.

                         RAFE
               I'll bust you open, you...German!

     The words ring something deep in the man's booze-broken
     brain.  He begins to cough, convulsively; it brings a blossom
     of blood to his mouth.  He wipes it with his hand, but blood
     clings to his teeth.  He chokes out --

                         DANNY'S FATHER
               I fought the Germans.

     He looks at Danny in shame, with the realization of what he's
     just done.  He turns and staggers away.

     Danny looks at Rafe -- a communication between boys joined by
     something deeper than blood.  Then Danny runs off after his
     father.

                         DANNY
               Daddy!  Daddy!  Wait.

     Danny catches him, takes his father's hand, and walks away
     with him.

     The crop duster we saw in the air has just landed, behind
     Rafe.  The pilot, RAFE'S FATHER, shuts off the engine.

                         RAFE'S FATHER
               What's goin' on, son?

                         RAFE
               Nothing.  Danny's Dad just come to get
               him.

     Rafe turns back to the ramshackle plane and replaces the 2x4
     propeller.  His father looks toward Danny and his father,
     walking away, then looks at his own son.

                         RAFE'S FATHER
               Hey, boy -- you wanna go up?

     Rafe can't believe it; he runs to the plane and hops into his
     father's lap.  As his father cranks the engine and tucks him
     into the harness, Rafe says --

                         RAFE
               Daddy, sometime will you take Danny up
               too?

                         RAFE'S FATHER
               Sure will, son.

     The engine races to life...and we --

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT.  NEW JERSEY AIR BASE - DAY

     American P-40 fighters blast through the air, props screaming
     and wind singing by their wings.

     There are eight pilots in their individual seats, and we
     focus on two:  RAFE MCCAWLEY has grown lean and handsome.
     And DANNY WALKER is very much the same.

     Their planes start swapping positions in the formation; while
     the other guys are flying along in a tight line, Rafe and
     Danny are playing, one of them gunning his engine to go high,
     the other diving and coming back up in his place,
     leapfrogging.

     It scares the other guys, having their planes flashing in and
     out, so close.  The TRAINING CAPTAIN, watching through
     binoculars on the ground, talks into his RADIO --

                         TRAINING CAPTAIN
               McCawley!  Walker!  Cut that out!

                         RAFE
               I thought this was a training flight.
               I'm just trying to give Danny some
               training.

                         DANNY
               Not on your best day, boy!

     Rafe grins and guns his plane low, in the opposite direction
     he was moving before.  Danny reacts almost instantly...
     leapfrogging in the opposite direction, scaring the piss out
     of everybody else.

                         TRAINING CAPTAIN
               That's it, get into a wedge!

     The squadron responds, forming up into a tight V, Rafe and
     Danny just behind and on either side of the center.

                         RAFE
               Didn't you say test the limits?

                         DANNY
               Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better
               line up a couple dozen women on the
               GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the
               air!

     Rafe grins, loving the challenge.  Then he and Danny do the
     leapfrogging maneuver laterally, swapping sides in the V.

                         TRAINING CAPTAIN
               Everybody down!

     EXT.  NEW JERSEY AIRFIELD - DAY

     The planes land in tight order and taxi off the runway; shut
     down their props, slide back the canopies and hop down.  We
     see young pilots we'll get to know:  ANTHONY, BILLY, RED.

                         TRAINING CAPTAIN
               Where are McCawley and Walker?

     EXT.  RAFE AND DANNY - STILL IN THE AIR - DAY

     They've circled to opposite ends of the airfield and are now
     heading right at each other, like two bullets playing
     chicken.

                         TRAINING CAPTAIN
               Aw shit...

     INT.  THE COCKPITS

     From Rafe and Danny's POV, the rush is awesome.

     THE PILOTS ON THE GROUND watch in awe as the P-40's get so
     close they can't possibly get out of each other's way.
     Billy, the most boyish-faced of the pilots, yells to drown
     out the sound of the collision...

     At the last instant, both planes snap a quarter turn so that
     their wings are vertical, and they shoot past each other
     belly to belly.

     IN THE COCKPITS

     Rafe and Danny burst out laughing.

     THE PILOTS ON THE GROUND

     laugh and congratulate each other.

                         TRAINING CAPTAIN
               You know what they say... You can take the
               crop duster out of the country -- but
               don't put him in a P-40.

     Rafe banks to land, and Danny tucks in behind him.  Danny has
     Rafe's plane in his sights.

                         DANNY
               If I had guns I'd be chewing up your --

     Rafe feints left, banks right, and appears behind Danny.

                         RAFE
               If you had guns, you'd be pissin' on 'em.

     They're almost to the landing strip, Rafe behind Danny.  But
     as Danny's wheels are about to touch, he guns his engine and
     snaps the nose of his plane straight up.

     THE OTHER PILOTS stop laughing.

                         ANTHONY
               He's doing an inside loop!

                         TRAINING CAPTAIN
               Aw, shit...

     Danny pulls it off, just barely making a full circle to come
     in behind Rafe and bounce to a stop on the runway.

                         DANNY
               Yee-hawww!!!

     Danny taxis his plane over to join the others.  He's grinning
     as he slides back his cockpit cover; then --

                         DANNY
               Where's Rafe?

     Red, tall with flaming orange hair, tips his chin toward the
     air.  Seeing Rafe's plane still in the air, Danny starts to
     refasten his harness.

                         TRAINING CAPTAIN
               You're down, Walker!  That's an order!

                         DANNY
               What about him?

                         TRAINING CAPTAIN
               He's not taking my orders anymore.

     Danny's just about to ask what the hell that means, when he
     notices Rafe climbing in a deliberate spiral.

                         DANNY
               He's gonna do it.

                         BILLY
               Do what?

                         DANNY
               It.
                    (beat)
               Aw, shit.  Aw shit shit shit...

     RAFE'S PLANE reaches two thousand feet, just a speck above
     them, and seems to pause in the air.

                         DANNY
               I shouldn't'a done an inside loop.
               I shouldn't'a done an inside loop.

                         BILLY
               Why?

                         DANNY
               Cause now he's gonna do an outside loop.

                         TRAINING CAPTAIN
               Aw shit.  Aw shit shit shit...

     Anthony and Billy join in, like an involuntary chant --

                         ANTHONY & BILLY
               Aw shit shit shit...

     RAFE, IN HIS COCKPIT, is tightly controlled, yet serene.  He
     noses the plane into a power dive.

     The P-40 screams toward the ground, picking up speed, going
     so fast it begins to shudder.

     THE OTHER PILOTS are transfixed.  Red is so nervous he can't
     get the words out.

                         RED
               Aw sh- sh- sh- sh-

                         BILLY
               Shit.

                         RED
               Yeah.

                         DANNY
               You can do it, Rafe.  You can do it.

     The P-40, hurtling toward the ground at nauseating speed,
     snaps into a half roll, streaking upside down over the
     runway.  Rafe hangs inverted in his flight harness, the
     asphalt of the runway shooting past, ten feet beyond his
     head.

     He pushes the plane into a climb, his cockpit on the outside
     of the circle.  The plane reaches the top of its arc, and
     almost stalls; but Rafe noses it over again, toward the
     earth, only this time he has very little altitude.  The plane
     hurtles down, still with it belly on the inside of the
     curve...

     And makes it full circle.  Rafe's head now is barely a foot
     off the asphalt as the plane shoots past, still inverted.

     THE OTHER PILOTS burst into cheers.

     RAFE, IN HIS COCKPIT permits himself a smile.

     He lands, and the guys run out to meet him...all except for
     the Training Captain, who stands there shaking his head.

     Danny jumps on the wing, as Rafe stops and slides back his
     canopy.  Danny grabs him by the harness and shakes him.

                         DANNY
               You could've killed yourself, you stupid
               bastard!

     He dives into the cockpit, hugging Rafe.

                         DANNY
               That was the most beautiful thing I ever
               saw.

     INT.  COLONEL DOOLITTLE'S OFFICE - DAY

     COLONEL JIMMY DOOLITTLE, mid-forties, is commander of the
     base.  He's as tough as he is good in the air.  And right now
     he's frowning at Rafe McCawley, standing at attention before
     him.

                         DOOLITTLE
               There are some people who think the
               outside loop is reckless and
               irresponsible.

                         RAFE
               How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if
               you were the first man in the world to do
               it?

                         DOOLITTLE
               Don't get smart with me, son.

                         RAFE
               Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous
               only for the kind of pilot who wants to
               show off, rather than inspire the other
               pilots in his unit.  And all you've done
               for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I
               did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir.
               What the French call a "homage."

                         DOOLITTLE
               That's bullshit, son.  But it's really
               good bullshit.

                         RAFE
               Thank you, Sir.

     Doolittle stands, moves around his desk, and shakes Rafe's
     hand.

                         DOOLITTLE
               Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire
               your decision.

                         RAFE
               Thank you, Sir.

     INT.  NEW JERSEY AIRFIELD - BARRACKS - NIGHT

     The pilots are getting slicked up for a night on the town.
     Danny's at the mirrors with the others; he's putting on
     cologne, and looks terrific in his uniform.

     Anthony and Billy are combing their hair at the sinks.  Billy
     declares to his image in the mirror --

                         BILLY
               You good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you
               EVER die!

                         ANTHONY
               That's your line for tonight, ya know.

                         BILLY
               What, good-lookin' sumbitch?

                         ANTHONY
               No, numbnuts, die.  You get your nurse
               alone, you look her in the eye, and say,
               "Baby, they're training me for war, and I
               don't know what'll happen.  But if I die
               tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all
               we could tonight."  I've never known it
               to fail.

     Red finishes brushing his teeth at the sink beside them.

                         RED
               He's n-never known it to work, either.

     The guys head out laughing, running into Rafe coming in.

                         DANNY
               Doolittle didn't kill you?  Attaboy!

     Rafe catches Danny's arm.

                         RAFE
               Danny, there's something I gotta tell
               you...

     EXT.  NEW JERSEY BARRACKS - NIGHT

     Rafe and Danny are walking on the parade ground; the other
     guys are already on the bus that will take them into town.
     Danny's upset by what Rafe just told him.

                         DANNY
               How could you do this?

                         RAFE
               The Colonel helped me work it out.

                         DANNY
               I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork,
               I mean how the hell did you do it without
               letting me in on it?

                         RAFE
               I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only
               accepting the best pilots.

                         DANNY
               Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're
               talking about war, and I know what war
               does to people.

                         RAFE
               Danny, you know how many times I saw you
               come to school with a black eye or a
               busted nose, and couldn't do a thing
               about it -- for you, or for your mother...
               or your father, with his lungs scorched
               out with mustard gas, and more left of
               his lungs than there was of his spirit?
               You've made your sacrifice, Danny.  It's
               time I made mine.

                         BILLY
                    (from the bus)
               The nurses are waiting!

                         RAFE
               Let's go.

                         DANNY
               Nah, you go on.

                         RAFE
               I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you
               to meet her.

                         DANNY
               Some other time.  I don't feel like a
               party.

     Danny walks away.  The bus driver's ready to leave, and Red
     is honking the horn for Rafe to come.  Rafe reluctantly lets
     Danny go, and heads for the bus, where the pilots are
     chanting --

                         PILOTS VOICE
               Nurses!  Nurses!  Nurses!

     INT.  A MOVING TRAIN - DAY

     The trains of 1942 have their own beauty, with felt seats,
     shaded lamps, and paneled compartments even in the economy
     section.  But the glow of the train is outshone by EVELYN
     STEWART.  She's one of ten young women, Army nurses, gathered
     at one end of the car as it rattles along the track.

     The other nurses are pretty and ripe -- maybe a bit too
     ripe.  Their lips painted bright red, their faces powdered,
     their spirits high.

     Evelyn listens in amusement to BETTY, a cute blonde with
     unmissable boobs, and BARBARA, a burnette equally endowed.

                         BETTY
               Do you have trouble with your boobs in
               the uniform?

                         BARBARA
               You mean hiding them?

                         BETTY
               Hide them?  On a date with pilots?  I'm
               talking about how you make them show!

     SANDRA, another nurse, speaks up.

                         SANDRA
               Loan 'em to me, I'll make 'em show.

                         BETTY
               The boobs or the pilots?

     The girls laugh and shove each others' knees; it's a party
     wherever they go.  But Evelyn can't keep her mind on the
     frivolity.  She looks out the window and her thoughts drift
     away.

                         BARBARA
               We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!

                         BETTY
               Ooo, she's thinking of her date!  Come
               on, you've been dating a pilot.  We want
               to know what we can expect.

     Suddenly all the girlish faces are looking at Evelyn.

                         EVELYN
               I've been dating one pilot.  And only for
               a few weeks.  But I know he's different
               from all the others.

     Sandra throws up her arms and swoons onto her friends.

                         SANDRA
               True love!...

                         BETTY
               Morphine, give her morphine!

                         BARBARA
               Give her an enema.

                         EVELYN
               But I do have a warning for you.  There's
               one line you all need to know, and you're
               likely to hear it from any man in a
               uniform.  It goes like this:  "Honey,
               Baby... We never know what's gonna happen,
               and I may die tomorrow...so, let's live
               all we can tonight."

     A silence among the nurses.

                         BARBARA
               I tell you.  Any one of those arrogant,
               leather-jacketed, slick-lookin' flyboys
               tries that line on me...he's gonna get
               anything he wants.

     As the nurses laugh --

     EXT.  NEW YORK TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

     Our pilots -- indeed leather-jacketed and handsome -- are
     waiting on the platform.  Among then is Rafe, holding
     something behind his back, as the train pulls in and shudders
     to a stop, clouds of steam jetting onto the platform and
     giving the moment a dream-like haze.

     INT./ EXT.  TRAIN - NEW YORK TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

     The nurses start stepping out; both pilots and nurses pretend
     surprise to see each.  At the door of the train, Evelyn
     whispers to Betty --

                         EVELYN
               Stick with me, I'll find you somebody
               good.

     Betty spot's Rafe.

                         BETTY
               I'll take that one.

                         EVELYN
               He's taken.  But come on, I'll introduce
               you.

     They move to Rafe; he crosses the platform to meet them, his
     eyes holding Evelyn.

                         RAFE
               Hello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you.

                         EVELYN
               You too, Lieutenant.

     Betty clears her throat.

                         EVELYN
               Oh, this is Betty.

                         RAFE
               Nice to meet you, Betty.

     He draws his hand from behind his back; he's holding two
     roses.  He hands one to Evelyn and the second to Betty.

                         RAFE
               Danny would'a brought this.

     He escorts them along the platform.

                         EVELYN
               Danny's not coming?

                         RAFE
               No, he...got some news today.  He'll be
               okay, he just didn't feel like coming
               tonight.

                         EVELYN
               I was hoping to meet him.

                         BETTY
               I was hoping to meet him.

                         RAFE
               We'll just have to find a substitute,
               won't we?

     Betty stops, and faces Rafe.

                         BETTY
               I just want to tell you one thing.  If
               you're thinking this might be your last
               night on earth?... I'm prepared to make
               it meaningful.
                    (leaning close)
               Very meaningful.

                         EVELYN
               At ease, Betty!

     INT.  CITY NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

     It's a party in full swing; swing music, jitterbugging,
     beautiful young men and women in high spirits.

     Rafe and Evelyn are sitting at a big table with the other
     pilots and nurses.  Anthony's paired up with Sandra, Billy
     with Barbara, and Red, shyest of the group, finds himself
     next to Betty.  Betty's already found a companion in Red
     Strange.

                         RED
               He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.

                         BETTY
               Red...Strange?

                         RED
               You know the football player, Red G-
               Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red,
               cause you know, I'm red...and they
               thought I was strange, so, you know, Red
               G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.

                         BETTY
               But...they called you Strange?  Because
               of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red
               Grange strange?

                         RED
               How would I know.

     Beside her beer is an open ketchup bottle; he picks it up and
     swigs from that.  Rafe and Evelyn see this, and try to keep
     from laughing.

                         BETTY
               Do you always stutter?

                         RED
               Only when I'm n-n-n-

                         BETTY
               Nervous?

                         RED
               Yeah.  But if I have to get something
               out, I c-can always s-s-s-
                    (he sings)
               SIIING!

     She covers his hand with hers.

                         BETTY
               Don't be nervous.

     Red looks at Betty with love in his eyes.  Under the table,
     Rafe and Evelyn join hands too.

                         EVELYN
               There shipping us out.  Hawaii.  The
               Germans are overrunning Europe, and we're
               sent to paradise.  How about you?  Have
               you heard anything?

     He hesitates; then Evelyn is distracted by the conversation
     beside them, between Barbara and Billy.

                         BILLY
               You're a very special woman, and...well
               baby, they're training me for war, and we
               don't know what happens tomorrow.  So we
               gotta make tonight special.

     Barbara shoots a look at Evelyn, before she answers.

                         BARBARA
               I hope you can back that up, flyboy.
               Cause you're not ever gonna forget
               tonight.

     She takes him by the hand and pulls him to his feet... They
     start dancing, sexy movements that won't stop till they've
     been in bed.

     Rafe pulls Evelyn to her feet, and leads her through the
     dancers, outside.

     EXT.  THE NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

     They find a quiet place on a balcony that overlooks the
     river, and Manhattan beyond.  Evelyn takes in the view,
     breathes in the air; she still holds the rose.

                         EVELYN
               Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't
               good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard
               to say.

                         RAFE
               The only reason it's hard to say is that
               I keep thinking I don't have the right to
               say it.  But I've got to because it's
               true.  I love you.
                    (beat)
               That must surprise you.

                         EVELYN
               It surprises me that I'm not the only one
               on this balcony who feels that way.

     The power of hearing this from each other grips them both.

                         RAFE
               There's one thing I have to say.  I'm
               going away.

                         EVELYN
               We're all going away.

                         RAFE
               I'm going to the war.  The real war.
               Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are
               hanging on by their fingernails, and If
               they lose, there'll be more people killed
               than anybody can imagine.  And not just
               there, but here.

                         EVELYN
               But you're in the U.S. Army, how could
               you --

                         RAFE
               Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and
               put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need
               pilots, and we need experience.  I leave
               tomorrow.

                         EVELYN
               You waited til tonight to tell me?

                         RAFE
               I had to tell you in person.  Because
               there's something else I need to say.

     He studies her face, burning it into his memory.

                         RAFE
               Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make
               tonight memorable.  What I feel about you
               makes it impossible for me to say
               something like that.  If I don't come
               back, I don't want to saddle you with
               regret and sadness you'll carry the rest
               of your life.

                         EVELYN
               I don't know if you can choose that,
               Rafe.

                         RAFE
               Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I
               love you.  And I will come back.  I'll
               find a way.  And then we'll get a chance
               to know if what I felt the first moment I
               saw you, and every minute since then, is
               real.

                         EVELYN
               Do one thing for me, before you go.

     She takes his hand and leads him inside.

     INT.  NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

     She leads him onto the dance floor, and they dance, among the
     others, yet in a world apart from everyone else.  And then
     they stop while all the others move around them, and kiss the
     kind of kiss that lasts a lifetime.

     EXT.  HOTEL - NIGHT

     The nurses are entering the hotel.  Pilots are going in with
     them.  But Rafe and Evelyn stop on the street.

     A last kiss.  Their hands touch a final time, and then part.
     She moves inside the lobby, and looks out the glass doors as
     he walks away.

     EXT.  TRAIN STATION - DAWN

     Rafe and Danny stand on the platform.  Rafe's got his gear
     packed in a bag slung over his shoulder.

                         CONDUCTOR'S VOICE
               All aboard!

     Rafe glances once more toward the revolving doors from the
     station that lead onto the platform.

                         DANNY
               Didn't you say you told her not to come?

                         RAFE
               Yeah.

                         DANNY
               Then why are you looking for her?

                         RAFE
               It's a test.  If I asked her to come and
               she came, it wouldn't tell me anything.
               If I tell her not to come, and she
               comes...then I know she loves me.

                         VOICE
               ALL ABOARD!

                         DANNY
               You're still a kid, ya know that?  Take
               care of yourself.

                         RAFE
               You too.

     Rafe sticks his hand out to Danny.  Danny knocks it away, and
     hugs him.

     Rafe steps onto the train, and it pulls away.  Rafe waves.
     Danny waves back and smiles, but he whispers like a prayer...

                         DANNY
               Give 'em hell, Rafe.

     INT.  TRAIN - DAWN

     Rafe finds a seat and sits down.  He's the only one in the
     car, and he's deeply alone.

     EXT.  TRAIN STATION - DAWN

     Danny walks to one of the three revolving doors back into the
     station.  He takes the one on the far right.  As he passes
     through it, he doesn't see Evelyn rushing through the door on
     the left side.  She's told herself she wouldn't come, but
     couldn't help it, and now as she sees the last car of the
     train disappearing around the corner the pain of it all hits
     her.

     She stands on the empty platform, as lonely as Rafe.

     MONTAGE - THE JOURNEYS

     Rafe and Evelyn travel in opposite directions, toward
     opposite ends of the earth...

     EXT.  A GRAY, COLD, CANADIAN SEAPORT - DAY

     as Rafe boards a Canadian naval vessel headed into the North
     Atlantic.

     EXT.  TRAIN - TRAVELING THROUGH THE AMERICAN WEST - DAY

     Evelyn and her fellow nurses ride the train through the
     American southwest.  The scenery outside the window is
     beautiful, but her thoughts are far away...

     EXT.  NORTH ATLANTIC - DAY

     Rafe's ship is in a convoy through the rough gray waters.
     The deck is loaded with military supplies bound for Britain.
     Rafe stands among the drab crates and seems oblivious to the
     rain, his thoughts on Evelyn.

     He looks toward the eastern horizon, where his ship is
     heading.  A deep, dark storm is brewing before them...

     EXT.  PACIFIC - DAY

     Evelyn stands on the deck of a ship headed in the opposite
     direction, on another ocean, the sky is clear, the breeze is
     warm, the light of a glowing sunset bathes her face.  The
     MONTAGE ENDS, with them heading to different ends of the
     earth.

     EXT.  BASSINGBORNE AIRFIELD - BRITAIN - DUSK

     In the eternal dusk of England, everything is cold and gray.
     British fighter planes -- Spitfires and Hurricanes -- are
     surrounded by mechanics hurriedly ripping off bullet riddled
     fuselage panels and digging into overworked aircraft engines.
     Rafe walks across the tarmac, still carrying his duffel bag.
     He moves up behind a slim, pale BRITISH AIR COMMANDER who is
     surveying engine damage on one of the Spitfires.

                         RAFE
               Rafe McCawley, Sir.

     Rafe salutes as the Air Commander turns and then returns the
     salute, with his left arm -- his right arm is gone.  Rafe
     freezes at the sight, reminded of Danny's father.

                         BRITISH AIR COMMANDER
               On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?

                         RAFE
               That's me, Sir.

                         BRITISH AIR COMMANDER
               Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll
               get you situated in some quarters, and
               then introduce you to the equipment
               you'll be flying.

                         RAFE
               If you're patching up bullet holes right
               here on the runway, maybe we should skip
               the housekeeping and get right to the
               planes.

                         BRITISH AIR COMMANDER
               Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are
               to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?

                         RAFE
               Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to
               matter.

     EXT.  BASSINGBORNE AIRFIELD - BRITAIN - DAY

     A Spitfire sits on the runway, and it's badly mangled -- a
     string of bullet holes punched through at mid-fuselage; a
     shot-off chunk of wingtip; but most striking is the blood
     still splattered over the inside of the cockpit.

                         BRITISH AIR COMMANDER
               Good lad.  Didn't die till he'd landed
               and shut down his engine.  Welcome to the
               war.

     He walks away, leaving Rafe to stare at the bloody cockpit.

     EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - MILITARY BASE - DAY

     Evelyn and the nurses enter the base, riding in two jeeps.
     As they stop at the gate, the guards look at them, especially
     Evelyn in the lead jeep; one guard mumbles to the other --

                         GUARD
               I've died and gone to heaven.

     The guards lift the bar and smile at the nurses.  The jeeps
     drive through.  The nurses are loving this island paradise
     already.

                         BARBARA
               You know the ratio of men to women on
               this island?  Four-thousand...to one.

     Barbara slides on a new pair of sunglasses with plastic palm
     trees glued on the sides, and calls back to the guards as the
     jeeps pull away --

                         BARBARA
               See ya on the beach, boys!

     EXT.  MILITARY BASE - NURSES' QUARTERS - OAHU - DAY

     As the other nurses happily unpack, Evelyn leaves and crosses
     the grass in the drenching sunshine.  We follow her into --

     INT.  BASE HOSPITAL - DAY

     She finds a small, immaculately clean hospital, twenty beds
     with luminous white sheets, all empty.

     Then she notices the view.  It's of Pearl Harbor, with the
     entire American Pacific fleet riding at anchor.  Battleships
     all in a row.  Aircraft carriers too, in perfect stillness on
     the aqua blue water with a white sand bottom.  The view is
     expansive and beautiful.

     The sound of an approaching fighter plane with wing guns
     firing as we --

                                        CUT TO:

     EXT.  THE DARK SKIES OVER THE ENGLISH CHANNEL - DAY

     Rafe, in the middle of an aerial dogfight, throws his
     Spitfire into a tight turn, swinging around to fire again
     into a squadron of Messerschmidts; they outnumber the British
     planes, and they're tougher and faster.  Rafe darts through
     their line, machine guns blazing.

     One of the Spitfires in Rafe's squadron has taken hits in the
     engine compartment and is sputtering, losing power, its
     pilot, NIGEL, frantic as the German planes swarm into finish
     him.

                         BRITISH PILOT (NIGEL)
               I need help!  Someone get them off me!

     Rafe slams his control stick hard right and goes into a power
     dive at one of the Messerschmidts.  Rafe's bullets chew up
     its cockpit and the plane goes into a fast corkscrew spiral,
     down into the water.

     Rafe instantly climbs again.  Nigel, in the moment of safety
     Rafe has bought him, bails out, his chute blossoming and
     carrying him toward the water.  The OTHER BRITISH PILOTS are
     impressed.

                         OTHER BRITISH PILOT
                    (into radio)
               Nigel's out!  I'll call in the position!
                    (to himself)
               That Yank is bloody good.

     Rafe swings his plane right back at the Germans; he attacks
     them head on, just like he went at Danny, only this time he's
     firing his machine guns.

     And OVER THIS ferocious dogfight, we hear his letter to
     Evelyn...

                         RAFE'S VOICE (LETTER)
               Dear Evelyn... It is cold here.  So cold,
               in a way that goes deep into your bones.

     The Messerschmidt in Rafe's sights breaks apart with the
     stream of precise fire he pours into it, its prop flying into
     pieces, its disintegration accelerated by its airspeed.
     Before it completely comes apart, it explodes.

     Rafe goes into another tight turn, to get at them again.

                         RAFE'S VOICE (LETTER)
               It's not easy making friends.  Two nights
               ago I drank a beer with a couple of the
               R.A.F. pilots -- beer's the only thing
               here that isn't cold -- and yesterday both
               of them got killed...

     As Rafe starts another attack we see him in the cockpit, in
     the trance of battle, as other Spitfires around him are
     getting shot out of the sky...as we --

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT.  HOSPITAL - PEARL HARBOR - DAY

     Evelyn, receiving the letter at mail call.

     She sits on the grass under a palm tree, in paradise, reading
     his letter.

                         RAFE'S VOICE (LETTER)
               There is one place I can go to find
               warmth, and that is to think of you.

     EXT.  OUTDOOR RESTAURANT - OAHU - DAY

     Evelyn is off duty, and wears a light cotton dress.  She's
     let her hair down, and her skin has the sheen of light sweat
     in the tropical heat.

     The restaurant is barely more than a shelter of palm wood
     posts with a frond roof, and it looks out over the harbor.
     Evelyn sits alone.  She's brought writing paper.  As the
     Hawaiian waiter serves her an icy tropical ambrosia with
     chunks of pineapple and a fresh plumeria flower floating at
     the rim of the glass, she lifts her pen.

     But before she can start to write, three naval officers move
     over to her table from the bar.  They're out of uniform too,
     wearing garish tropical shirts.

                         NAVY GUY 1
               A woman beautiful as you shouldn't be
               sitting alone.  Buy you a drink?

                         EVELYN
               Thank you...Ensign.

     The guys look at each other, impressed that she could tell.

                         NAVY GUY 1
               Ensign!  Smart too!

                         NAVY GUY 2
               So how about that drink?  Or dinner?

                         EVELYN
               Thank you, but...I really want to be
               alone right now.

                         NAVY GUY 3
               Want to see something long and hard?

     He shows her the tattoo of an anchor on his forearm.  Evelyn
     looks away from them, toward the harbor.

                         EVELYN
               I'm sorry.  I've got a letter to write.

                         NAVY GUY 3
               Cold bitch.

     His friends start to pull him away, but Evelyn's eyes flare.

                         EVELYN
               What did you say?

                         NAVY GUY 3
               I said you're cold.

                         EVELYN
               Cold?  No, I'm just thinking about a war.
               And maybe you should be too.

     They leave, shaking their heads.  Evelyn picks up her pen,
     and writes.

                         EVELYN'S VOICE (LETTER)
               Dear Rafe... It's strange to be so far
               from you in body, and so close to you in
               spirit.  But if our spirits really give
               our bodies life, then you should know
               this:  Every night I look at the sunset,
               and try to draw the last ounce of heat
               from its long day...

     She looks toward the sunset now; then she writes again...

     EXT.  BASSINGBORNE AIRFIELD - BRITAIN - NIGHT

     Rafe brings his battered plane in for a landing...

     INT.  BRITISH AIRFIELD BARRACKS - NIGHT

     Rafe sits on his cot, reading her letter.

                         EVELYN'S VOICE (LETTER)
               ...and send it from my heart to yours.

     Rafe is startled as the Air Commander appears beside his
     bunk.

                         BRITISH AIR COMMANDER
               Air-Sea Rescue picked up Nigel.  He'll be
               back with us tomorrow.

     Rafe nods, glad to hear the news.  The Commander starts to
     walk away, then turns back.

                         BRITISH AIR COMMANDER
               Some of us look down on the Yanks for not
               yet joining this war.  I'd just like to
               say that if there are many more back home
               like you, God help anyone who goes to war
               with America.

     The Commander salutes, with his left hand.  And Rafe salutes
     too -- with his left hand.

     EXT.  ESTABLISHING THE WHITE HOUSE - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY

     The White House looks somehow whiter and purer in the glow of
     1941.

     INT.  PRESIDENTIAL CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

     GENERALS, ADMIRALS, and other advisors sit around the
     polished table -- all males, in suits and in uniforms.  The
     door opens, and the men all stand.

     PRESIDENT FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT appears, in a wheelchair, pushed
     by a huge black valet, GEORGE.  The President's legs are
     shriveled, braced with the iron supports that attach to his
     shoes and are apparent beneath the cloth of his pin-striped
     pants.  From the waist up Roosevelt is heavily muscled,
     powerful, and handsome even in his little spectacles.  The
     valet rolls him to the head of the table; he's speaking even
     before he settles in.

                         PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
               Please be seated, gentlemen.

     They sit, as one.

                         PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
               Churchill and Stalin are asking me what
               I'm asking you:  How long is America
               going to pretend the world is not at war?

                         GENERAL MARSHALL
               We've increased supply shipments to them,
               Mr. President, and we're losing merchant
               vessels every day.

                         PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
               Shift in every destroyer and anti-
               aircraft weapon you can find.

                         ADMIRAL
               Sir, our Pacific Fleet is already down
               to almost nothing.

                         PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
               Gentlemen, at this moment the nation of
               Hungry has a larger military then the
               United States.  We have no choice but to
               draw from whatever we can.

     EXT.  ESTABLISHING TOKYO - JAPAN - NIGHT

     INT.  JAPANESE HIGH COMMAND - NIGHT

     The Conference Room is similar to that of the White House.
     But this table is low and all the men sit on the floor.  And
     there are no civilians here; Japan is now a nation ruled by
     its warriors.

     The last man to enter the room and take his place is ADMIRAL
     YAMAMOTO.  Harvard educated, Yamamoto is an object of
     veneration and suspicion among the men of the war council.
     Yamamoto bows, sits, and looks across the table at his friend
     Genda, who can't hide his fear.  Yamamoto glances to the far
     end of the table where NISHIKURA, chief of the War Council,
     sits glowering.  (Their discussion is in Japanese, with
     subtitles.)

                         NISHIKURA
               So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us
               thought your education at an American
               university would make you too weak to
               fight the Americans.

                         YAMAMOTO
               If knowledge of opponents and careful
               calculation of danger is taken as
               weakness then I have misunderstood what
               it means to be Japanese.

                         NISHIKURA
               The time has come to strike!  Or to sit
               and let the Americans cut off our oil and
               our future.  I know what you whisper to
               the others, Yamamoto -- that the Americans
               are strong.  Yet look at their leader.

     He motions to OYAMA, an intelligence analyst, who opens a
     file and lays out pictures of Roosevelt.

                         OYAMA
               Franklin Roosevelt.  Born into great
               wealth.  Fifteen years ago, he was
               stricken with polio.  Now he cannot walk,
               or even stand without help.
               Photographers will not take pictures of
               him in his chair; Americans do not wish
               to know how weak their President is.

     Yamamoto makes a low grunt.

                         NISHIKURA
               You have something to say, Yamamoto?

                         YAMAMOTO
               The Council knows I have opposed fighting
               the Americans.  No matter how great our
               resolve, they have resources beyond ours.
               If we must go to war, there is only one
               way -- deal them a blow from which it will
               take them years to recover.  In that time
               we can conquer all of the Pacific, and
               they will have no choice but to ask for
               peace.

                         NISHIKURA
               You see us as capable of such a blow?

                         YAMAMOTO
               The Americans themselves have made it
               possible.  We will annihilate them in a
               single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.

     The members of the war council are so pleased with Yamamoto
     that they bow to him.  Only Genda keeps his eyes raised long
     enough to see the sadness in Yamamoto's face.

     EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - AIR BASE - BARRACKS - DAY

     Danny Walker and his pilot buddies have just arrived; they
     enter the barracks, talking happily.

                         RED
               If I ain't n-never on a b-boat again,
               it'll be too s-soon.

                         BILLY
               Where are the women on this --

     Danny has stopped before the others; now all of them see that
     the other pilots who inhabit this air base are still in their
     beds, sleeping off hangovers.  They wear Hawaiian shirts;
     they haven't shaved.

                         RED
               They're s-still asleep!

     Danny pauses for a moment, then shouts --

                         DANNY
               Drop your cocks and grab your socks,
               boys!  The terror of the skies are here!

     The sleeping pilots groan, and cover their heads with their
     pillows.

                         ANTHONY
               They're all drunk.

     One guy sits up in bed, his hair pointing every direction of
     the compass, his tongue working as if to wipe a terrible
     taste from his mouth.  As his feet dangle over the side of
     the bunk and one of them touches the floor, a sensation
     reaches his sotted brain; he raises that foot to look at its
     bottom, and finds a new tattoo, on the sole of his foot; he
     blinks as if trying to remember how it got there.

     Danny moves over to him, and dubs him with a name, COMA.

                         DANNY
               Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.

                         COMA
               Where's that lizard?

                         DANNY
               What lizard?

                         COMA
               The one that slept in my mouth last
               night.

                         DANNY
               What the hell happened to you guys?

     Coma is one of those drunks who speak as if he's always about
     to burp.

                         COMA
               Ever hear of mai-tai's?  Comes in a
               big...pot.  Like...like...

                         RED
               A m-missionary?

                         COMA
               No, like...

     Coma emits a pukey, toxic burp that has Danny and his buddies
     wincing back from the fumes.

                         DANNY
               This is an Air Base?  Where's your squad
               commander?

     The question soaks through to Coma's brain.  His right hand
     points...and his left hand points...in different directions.
     His hands float around in the air until finally both of them
     are indicating the same direction, behind his back.  In the
     bunk beyond Coma's is another drunk pilot in a Hawaiian
     shirt...and to judge by the shapely bronzed leg that
     protrudes from under his damp sheet, there's a woman with him
     too.

     Danny and his buddies are speechless -- except for Red
     Strange.

                         RED
               I th-think I'm gonna like it here.

                         COMA
               You guys are new?

                         DANNY
               Yeah.

                         COMA
               Mai-tai's.  I got this to tell ya, about
               mai-tai's.

     Coma's head drifts forward slowly; they think for a moment
     he's looking for something under the bed.  Then he pukes.
     Danny leaps back from the splatter, and marches out of the
     barracks; his friends follow.

     EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - AIRFIELD - DAY

     Danny and his buddies stride up to the airfield.  It's full
     of fighter planes -- and they're all bunched together in
     clusters on the field.  Danny grabs a MECHANIC.

                         DANNY
               Hey!  What is this, the planes all
               bunched up like that?

                         MECHANIC
               The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This
               makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier
               to service.

                         DANNY
               What about easier to hit in an air raid?

                         MECHANIC
               Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four
               thousand miles away.  So you guys just
               arrived, huh?

                         DANNY
               Yeah.

                         MECHANIC
               We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!

     The mechanic walks off.  Danny and the guys are left standing
     on the tarmac.

                         DANNY
               Well guys...I reckon there's just one
               thing to do...

     INT.  OAHU BAR - DAY

     Danny and the pilots are in Hawaiian shirts, their party in
     full swing.  A bucket-sized hollowed-out volcano sits in the
     middle of the table, with twelve straws emerging from the
     crater.  It's full of booze -- or was; Danny and the other
     guys are pulling heartily at the straws, and they gurgle as
     the last liquid is sucked dry.

                         RED
               More m-mai-tai's!

     Coma is sitting there with them, beside Red.

                         COMA
               Absolutely right.

     Everybody's having a ball, the new arrivals fitting right in
     with the others.  Danny's a bit off to himself, lost in his
     own thoughts.  Billy and Anthony are doing the hula to the
     Hawaiian music playing.

                         COMA
               No, you guys aren't doing it right.  It's
               in the hands.  They talk story.

     Coma stands and starts demonstrating, explaining the gestures
     of his hula.

                         COMA
               Fish swim in ocean... Happy in the Mother
               Sea... Girl, beautiful girl, with big
               jugs, walks into water...waves lapping at
               her thighs...

                         ANTHONY
               I never knew those dances were so
               sophisticated.

                         COMA
               ...Fish nibble at her breasts...

     Coma's really into his dance, his hands over enormous
     imaginary breasts; but as he turns toward the windows --

                         COMA
               A more beautiful girl walks by...

     The guys see Evelyn passing on the other side of the street,
     gorgeous in the sunshine.  Coma's hands start squeezing the
     imaginary breasts of his hula.

                         BILLY
               Hey, isn't that Evelyn?

     Danny moves up to look.

                         DANNY
               Rafe's girl, Evelyn?

                         COMA
               You guys know her?!  I gotta have an
               intro!  Man, I'd like to --

     Danny's hand is suddenly around Coma's larynx.

                         DANNY
               A friend of mine's in love with her.  So
               you don't even look -- not ever.

     Danny releases him and Coma staggers back to the table to
     nuzzle up to one of the straws of the mai-tai volcano.

     Danny looks out the window again and sees Evelyn's beautiful
     form disappear around the corner, on her way back to the base
     hospital.  Danny moves back to the table, and as two burly
     Hawaiian waiters set another full loaded mai-tai volcano onto
     the center of the table, he picks up a glass and dips it full
     of the potent liquid.  He shouts to the whole room --

                         DANNY
               I'm a better pilot than any son-of-a-
               bitch on this island!  So I'm the one to
               say this!  Here's to Rafe McCawley!  A
               better pilot...and a better man...than
               me.

     The other pilots drink up -- from glasses or from straws.

                         OTHER PILOTS
               To Rafe.

     Danny drains the whole glass at one chug, and slams it down
     onto the table.  Then he blinks, puts a hand on his stomach,
     and frowns.  Coma recognizes the look.

                         COMA
               Uh oh.  Volcanic eruption!

     Danny bends at the waist; his head obscured by the table.

                         COMA
               Shit, he's puking on my feet!

                         RED
               Well, you p-puked on his feet.

                         COMA
               Yeah, but he was wearing shoes!

     INT.  ADMIRAL KIMMEL'S OFFICE - OAHU - DAY

     ADMIRAL KIMMEL is Commander of the American Pacific Fleet.

     Two members of his staff are standing uncomfortably in front
     of him, having delivered a message from the Joint Chiefs of
     Staff.

                         ADMIRAL KIMMEL
               ...transfer twelve more destroyers to
               Atlantic Fleet, and all the available
               anti-aircraft weaponry?!  Washington has
               gone insane!

     Kimmel's STRATEGIC ANALYST speaks up.

                         STRATEGIC ANALYST
               We've done what you ordered, Admiral, and
               war gamed the likely outcome of a
               Japanese attack against each of our major
               bases in the Pacific.  Wake, Guam,
               Midway, the Philippines.  In each case,
               we lose.

                         ADMIRAL KIMMEL
               You left out Hawaii.

                         STRATEGIC ANALYST
               Pearl Harbor can't be attacked
               effectively from the air.  It's too
               shallow for an aerial torpedo attack.
               Pearl Harbor's safe.  It's everywhere
               else that we're vulnerable.

                         ADMIRAL KIMMEL
               Step up surveillance of Japanese
               communications.  They're gonna do
               something somewhere.  I can feel it.

     EXT.  THE SKIES ABOVE OAHU - DAY

     A seaplane takes tourists on an excursion above Pearl Harbor
     and around the island of Oahu.  One Japanese tourist shoots
     pictures rapidly...first of the ships as seen from overhead;
     then he leans to the other side of the plane and shoots
     pictures of the airfield below them.

     EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

     Another Japanese tourist hikes through the hills above Pearl
     Harbor.  He takes an excellent camera from his picnic basket,
     and shoots pictures.

     CLOSE - THE PICTURES, being carried down a hallway, into --

     INT.  JAPANESE PLANNERS OFFICE - DAY

     The courier places the pictures onto the table in front of
     Yamamoto, Genda, and the other JAPANESE OFFICERS.

                         GENDA
               Look at the ships -- all grouped.  Perfect
               targets!

                         JAPANESE OFFICER
               And the planes!  They are -- what is that
               American expression?  Sitting geese?

                         YAMAMOTO
               Sitting ducks.

                         JAPANESE OFFICER
               How can they be so foolish?

                         YAMAMOTO
               They think no one would be stupid enough
               to attack them at Pearl Harbor.

                         GENDA
               Or perhaps they think no one is capable.
               Look at this...

     He moves to a diagram displayed on the wall -- a simple
     display showing water depth and ship displacement.

                         GENDA
               Pearl Harbor's depth of only forty feet
               makes them feel safe.  A torpedo dropped
               from an airplane plunges to one hundred
               feet before it can level off.  That is a
               conventional torpedo.  But we have been
               experimenting.

     From a stand beside his diagram he takes a set of wooden
     fins, attached to a circular metallic band.

                         GENDA
               Wooden fins.  We are testing them
               tomorrow.

     EXT.  JAPANESE ISLAND - DAY

     Yamamoto and his planners have flown to a quiet Japanese
     island, sunlit and pleasant.  They are gathered on the shore
     of the island's natural harbor.  Wooden targets -- basically
     huge plank barriers -- are sunk into the water like ships at
     anchor.  A squadron of Japanese planes zooms overhead, taking
     up attack positions.

                         GENDA
               We have chosen this place because its
               depth is exactly the same as Pearl
               Harbor's.

     Genda speaks into a field radio.  A lone plane drops out of
     formation and goes into a low-level approach, speeding up and
     dropping its torpedo.

     BELOW THE SURFACE we see the torpedo as it plunges at two
     hundred miles an hour into the sunlit sea.  With the wooden
     fins the torpedo makes a sharp dip and levels off above the
     sea floor.

     ABOVE THE SURFACE the planners see the path of the torpedo;
     it hits the wooden barrier with a satisfying THUNK.  The
     planners are impressed -- but Yamamoto is not satisfied.

                         YAMAMOTO
               Uncharged torpedoes have different
               balance.

                         GENDA
               I have arranged a live fire drill -- with
               your permission.

     Yamamoto nods; Genda speaks again into his radio, and another
     plane swoops down and drops a torpedo.  Genda holds his hands
     to his ears, causing the others to do the same; even though
     they wonder at the need.

     The torpedo hits the barrier, and the explosion is deafening,
     and of shocking force; the entire barrier is blown to
     toothpicks.

                         GENDA
               Of course against a ship the explosion
               will not be dissipated, and will have
               more force.

     The planners, nearly blown off their feet, nod as if they
     knew that all the time.

     INT.  MILITARY BASE - PILOTS' BARRACKS - NIGHT

     The pilots are getting slicked up.

                         BILLY
               Are you sure they're here?

                         ANTHONY
               If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!

     Red moves up beside him to frown at the mirror.  His hair is
     plastered down and parted, his uniform's immaculate.

                         ANTHONY
               Looking good, Red.

                         RED
               Shut up.

     Red moves away, to polish his shoes.

                         ANTHONY
               What is it with Red?  I've never seen him
               this way.

                         BILLY
               He's been like that all day.  Hey Danny,
               you coming?

                         DANNY
               Nah, I'm gonna stay here.  Read.

     Anthony and Billy look at each other; Danny's in his bunk,
     and he's not reading, just staring at the ceiling.

     INT.  NURSES' BARRACKS - PEARL HARBOR - NIGHT

     The nurses are primping to go out; Evelyn is in her uniform
     getting ready to go back to work.

                         BARBARA
               Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I
               mean, you can put your hands on him if
               you want to, but then my hands will break
               yours.

                         BETTY
               He was that good?

                         BARBARA
               No, I was.

     EXT.  NURSES' QUARTERS - OAHU - NIGHT

     Creeping through the vegetation, Red leads Anthony and Billy
     to a spot outside the nurses' barracks; they can see the
     girls through the barracks window.

                         BILLY
               Red, Peeping Tom stuff can get us court-
               marshaled.

                         RED
               Shhh!

     Anthony and Billy are baffled, even more so when Red strides
     into the open, right outside the nurses' window.

     And then, Red begins to sing.

                         RED
                    (singing)
               Oh...Betty, Betty, Betty, you're the one
               for me, Betty, Betty, Betty, Betty, can't
               you see...

     Anthony and Billy look at each other, dumbfounded.  The
     nurses move to the open windows.  Red's singing is pretty
     good -- though not that good.  But he doesn't stutter when he
     sings.

                         RED
                    (singing)
               I'll be yours for eternity, Betty, Betty,
               Betty, Betty, Betty!

     Anthony and Billy are hysterical, trying to keep their
     laughter hidden.  But then they see the effect this is having
     on the women -- especially on Betty.  She's smitten.

     Red repeats the verse, really getting into it; when he
     finishes, Betty runs out and hugs him, as all the nurses
     applaud.  They move off into the darkness, arm and arm.

     The nurses go back to their primping.

     Anthony and Billy are changed men.  Anthony stands up;
     Billy's baffled.  Anthony moves out and starts singing.

                         ANTHONY
                    (singing)
               Oh Sandra...I like you...love you...

     He's terrible.  The nurses pelt him with hairbrushes,
     curlers, shoes...

     EXT.  BASSINGBORNE AIRFIELD - BRITAIN - DAY

     Coming out of the blustery skies at the end of another deadly
     day, a squadron of Spitfires chirps in for landings.  The
     planes are shot up and battered.

     Rafe is one of the pilots; the fuselage below his cockpit is
     marked with four swastikas, symbols of his victories.  He
     taxis to a stop, and is met by IAN, a Scottish mechanic, who
     is dismayed at the state of the plane.

                         IAN
               Leapin' Jesus!

                         RAFE
                    (climbing down)
               The struts are loose, the hydraulics are
               leaking, and the electrical system's
               shorting out in the cockpit.

                         IAN
               Well which of those three ya want fixed?

                         RAFE
               All of 'em.

     Rafe starts away, and Ian calls to his back --

                         IAN
               If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya
               should'a stayed in the bloody States!

                         RAFE
               And if you don't give me a plane that can
               handle combat, you better start learning
               to speak German.

                         IAN
               Fook ya!

                         RAFE
               Learn English, then!

                         IAN
               Fook ya dooble!

     Rafe moves to the barracks; Ian keeps the fueling hose going,
     and moves to help the armorers reload the guns.

     INT.  BRITISH AIRFIELD BARRACKS - NIGHT

     Rafe falls down onto his cot, exhausted.  The other pilots do
     the same, everybody spent from the day's combat.  Then they
     hear the SIREN.  Rafe's out of his bunk, with the others,
     everybody running.

                         BRITISH PILOT
               Bloody Krauts!  Night raid!

     EXT.  BASSINGBORNE AIRFIELD - BRITAIN - NIGHT

     They race across the runway.  Rafe reaches his Spitfire, just
     as Ian is removing the fueling hose.

                         IAN
               I have'na been able ta --

                         RAFE
               Crank her!

     Ian gives the prop a spin, and the engine roars to life.

                         IAN
               God speed ya, laddie.

     EXT.  SKIES OVER THE ENGLISH CHANNEL - NIGHT

     It's dark, but there are breaks in the clouds, giving way to
     patches of light from a full moon.  The squadron of Spitfires
     tightens up for battle.

     Rafe is positioned just right of the squad leader; he sees
     planes breaking out of the dark clouds ahead.

                         RAFE
               Here they come.

     The clouds break, revealing a huge attack formation.

                         BRITISH SQUAD LEADER
               Alpha group, on the bombers!  Beta group,
               take the fighters!

     They peel off, into action.

     EXT.  THE AIR BATTLE OVER THE CHANNEL - NIGHT

     We stay with Rafe as he and the Squad Leader rush side by
     side at the lead bomber, blasting away with their guns.

     INT.  GERMAN BOMBER - IN THE AIR - NIGHT

     The Spitfires' bullets rip into the pilot and also kill the
     nose gunner; the bomber dips as the copilot struggles to take
     control.

     INT.  RAFE, IN HIS SPITFIRE - NIGHT

     As he streaks past, Rafe sees the bomber wobble in the air.

                         RAFE
               We've got him hurt, stay on him!

     Rafe throws his plane into an ultra-tight, high speed turn,
     right between the tails of the leader German group and the
     noses of the second.  His turn is so tight that the plane
     flexes with the g-force.

     Rafe comes out of his turn ahead of the Squad Leader, and
     races back up through the formation of German bombers, moving
     above them where their weapons and armaments are the weakest.
     He stitches a trail of bullets from tail to nose of the
     wounded lead bomber; it begins to smoke.

     The second Spitfire, the Squad Leader's, takes fire from the
     other German bombers, and shears off, heading through the
     smoke of the plane Rafe has on the ropes.

                         RAFE
               We've got him going!

     Rafe does a half-loop and half-spin, to bring him around to
     face the bombers again.  This time the g-force of the turn
     pops an oil line inside Rafe's cockpit; hot, pressurized oil
     begins to spray everywhere -- all over Rafe, his controls,
     and worst of all, over the inside of his cockpit glass.

     He wipes at the oil with his hands and that just smears it
     and makes it worse.

     His wingman sees him veering away from the bombers...and sees
     the German fighters moving up to meet him.

                         SQUAD LEADER
               McCawley!  Get to the clouds!  Get into
               the clouds!

     RAFE, IN HIS PLANE, is flying blind.

                         RAFE
               I can't see the clouds!

     His problems are just beginning; the fluid is dripping down
     onto his cockpit's corroded electrical wiring; the fluid
     causes an arc...a spark...and suddenly a fire is spreading
     through Rafe's plane.

     He grabs his fire extinguisher and triggers a cloud that
     snuffs the fire but fills the entire cockpit with choking
     smoke; between that and the smeared fluid on his glass, he
     can't see a thing.

     And the Messerschmidts are swarming over him.

     Rafe's wingman dives in, raking the German planes as he
     passes.

     Rafe tries to open his cockpit cover to clear the smoke, but
     it's jammed; he pulls out his .45 pistol and BLAM!  BLAM!
     BLAM!  He blows out the glass; the smoke clears enough for
     him to take a breath and try to see.  He fights the stick,
     but the plane won't respond.

     The Messerschmidts rake him again, bullets riddling his
     engine.

                         SQUAD LEADER
               Get out of there, McCawley!  Get out of
               there!

     Rafe's plane descends, ever faster, passing through clouds,
     then clear air again.  The Squad Leader tries to chase and
     cover him, but Rafe's dropping fast, and still isn't out of
     the plane as the Germans dive on him again, firing.

     Rafe's Spitfire hits the broken fog over the water -- the
     Squad Leader loses sight of it for a moment -- and then the
     plane hits, splashing and exploding all at once.

     The Squad Leader winces, and ducks into the clouds as he
     reports on his radio...

                         SQUAD LEADER
               McCawley down.  No 'chute.

     EXT.  BATTLESHIP WEST VIRGINIA - PEARL HARBOR - DAY

     The sailors have assembled on deck for the ship's heavyweight
     championship fight, a contest made more interesting to the
     sailors because one of the combatants is white and the other
     is black.

     The battle is more toughness than technique.  The guys
     throwing haymakers and shoving each other around the roped
     area, as their shipmates cheer and make wild bets.  The white
     guy digs a punch deep into the black guy's ribs, and the
     black guy slams a double left hook into the white guy's
     belly, making him back up and say --

                         WHITE BOXER
               You hit hard -- for a cook.

     The black guy rushes the white guy, only to catch a right
     cross that wobbles his knees and makes him stagger, with a
     fresh cut over his right eye.  The white guy now rushes in,
     and the black guy (his name is DORIE MILLER) throws an upper
     cut that drops his opponent like a sack of rocks.

     The sailors cheer wildly.  Dorie steps back, and rubs his
     glove across his brow.  It's really bleeding now.

     EXT.  MILITARY BASE - DAY

     Evelyn is returning from church with six of her nurse
     friends.  It's very quiet on a Sunday morning, almost nobody
     at the base; they walk along the path.

                         BARBARA
               Let's get into civvies and find a bar.

                         MARTHA
               Right after church?

                         BARBARA
               You've gotta sin some, to get
               forgiveness.  Come with us, Evelyn.  You
               need some sin.

                         EVELYN
               I've got to write some requisitions.
               We're undersupplied with morphine.

                         BETTY
               Morphine?  We've been here a month and
               nobody's had worse than a sunburn.

     Evelyn smiles softly and walks toward the base hospital.

                         BETTY
               I wish she could forget him.

                         BARBARA
               You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.

     EXT.  HOSPITAL - PEARL HARBOR - DAY

     Evelyn approaches the hospital and finds the black boxer
     peering in the window.  He's in a T-shirt and navy pants.

                         EVELYN
               Can I help you, sailor?

     As Dorie turns, she sees the cut on his head, closed only
     with a band-aid; it's dripping blood down his T-shirt.

                         DORIE
               'Scuse me, 'Mam.  All the ship's doctors
               is golfing, and I couldn't find nobody to
               look at this.

                         EVELYN
               Our doctor's gone too.

                         DORIE
               Sorry to trouble you.

                         EVELYN
               Wait, let me look at that... You better
               come in here.

     INT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - DAY

     Miller is sitting on a stool; Evelyn bathes the wound.

                         EVELYN
               How'd you get this?

                         DORIE
               Boxin'.

                         EVELYN
               Win?

                         DORIE
               Yes'm.

     He says it without pride.  She puts down the basin.

                         EVELYN
               What's your name?

                         DORIE
               Dorie Miller, 'Mam.

                         EVELYN
               I'm Evelyn.  And I'm just a nurse.  But
               I'm not playing golf, and that cut needs
               sewing, or else it's gonna make a big
               lumpy scar.  Whatta ya say?

     INT.  HOSPITAL - PEARL HARBOR - LATER

     Evelyn clips the ends of her carefully applied stitches;
     Dorie's eyes are rolled up as if he could watch from inside
     his skull.

                         EVELYN
               How often you fight like this?

                         DORIE
               Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight
               champion of the West Virginia.

                         EVELYN
               What do you get for winning?

                         DORIE
               Respect.

     She hands him a mirror.  He studies her work.

                         DORIE
               No doctor would'a give me that good.

     She walks him to the door.

                         DORIE
               Thank you, 'Mam.

                         EVELYN
               Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big
               as you -- and smart too, you knew where
               to come when your ship couldn't help --
               do you still have to fight with your
               fists to get respect?

                         DORIE
               I left my Mama and joined the Navy to be
               a man.  They made me a cook -- and not
               even that, really -- I clean up after the
               other sailors eat.  I shine the officer's
               shoes.  In two years, they've never even
               let me fire a gun.

     Now Evelyn understands.

                         EVELYN
               You take care, Dorie.

                         DORIE
               You too, 'Mam.

     EXT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - SUNSET

     Dorie walks away, down the path between the palm trees.  She
     watches him go, and then is transfixed by someone else
     coming, silhouetted by the light of the setting sun.  She
     can't make out his face, but he's wearing a pilot's dress
     uniform, and coming to her right out of the warm orange
     sunset that she has stared at so many times.  Her heart slams
     against her ribs; she takes a few steps forward.

                         EVELYN
               ...Rafe...

     She moves toward him, and he draws near her, walking slowly.
     And then she sees his face...

     It's Danny.  His face as sad as death itself.

     And even before he tells her, she knows.

                         DANNY
               Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker.  I'm Rafe
               McCawley's best friend.

                         EVELYN
               Were.  Isn't that what you mean?  Were.
               Because he's dead, isn't he?  And that's
               why you've come.

     EXT.  A BENCH - OVERLOOKING PEARL HARBOR - SUNSET

     Evelyn and Danny sit on the bench, with a sweeping view of
     the harbor and the lights winking on all around it as the sun
     settles beyond the horizon.  Evelyn is stoic, numb; Danny is
     the one who is struggling.

                         DANNY
               Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the
               one to tell you, if it happened.

                         EVELYN
               He told me about you.  That he had no
               other friend like you.

                         DANNY
               Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business,
               owned their own planes.  Real straight,
               frugal.  My father was the town drunk.
               Went to sleep one night on the railroad
               tracks and was still there when the Dawn
               Express came along.  Rafe and I were the
               only ones at the funeral.  He took me
               back to his house, and I never left.

                         EVELYN
               You were more like brothers.

                         DANNY
               I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me
               how to fly.

                         EVELYN
               He said you're the only one he ever saw
               who was better in the air than him.

                         DANNY
               ...He said that?

     Evelyn nods, still staring away from Danny.  This pierces
     Danny; he looks away, struggling not to let the emotions pull
     him completely under.

                         DANNY
               Look, uh...Rafe's dad...he wrote me with
               the news, and it took me a couple of days
               to work up the guts to come here and tell
               you.  I'm not as brave as Rafe, or as
               noble.  But if there's anything I can
               ever do to help -- you let me know, okay?

     She stares into the distance.  He stands and puts his hand on
     top of hers, as much for his comfort as for hers.

                         DANNY
               I understand why Rafe loved you.  You're
               as strong as he was.

     Since she's still not looking at him, he starts to move away.
     When he reaches the turn in the path, he looks back, and sees
     her figure in the gathering darkness.  She's begun to break
     down; and as he watches, her whole body starts convulsing,
     and she doubles up in shattering grief.

     Danny can't just stand there; he moves back to her, and puts
     a hand on her shoulder.  He sits beside her again, and
     suddenly she turns to him and sobs upon him.  Danny wraps her
     gently in his arms, and then he breaks down, having found the
     first place he can truly grieve.

     EXT.  JAPANESE BOMBING PRACTICE - JAPANESE ISLAND - DAY

     The Japanese have constructed a replica of Pearl Harbor on
     their practice island; erecting new target barriers and
     silhouettes of the various ships anchored at Pearl.  Streams
     of Japanese planes skim overhead in practice bombing runs,
     dropping dummy torpedoes and bombs.  From a control platform
     erected on the beach, Yamamoto and Genda oversee it all.

                         YAMAMOTO
               Everything real except the fact that no
               one is shooting back at us.

                         GENDA
               If we achieve surprise, they will offer
               little resistance.

                         YAMAMOTO
               Set up teams of radio operators to send
               out messages the Americans will
               intercept, concerning every potential
               American target in the Pacific.  Include
               Hawaii -- the clutter will be more
               confusing that way.

                         GENDA
               Brilliant, Admiral.

                         YAMAMOTO
               A brilliant man would find a way not to
               fight a war.

     He looks out at the planes roaring into his practice harbor
     at top speed...

     INT.  PRESIDENTIAL BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Roosevelt's valet leans over him.

     Roosevelt wakes; beside the valet is a Presidential AIDE.

                         AIDE
               Mr. President, we've received a message
               from the Argentinian ambassador to Japan.
               His sources tell him the Japanese are
               assembling their fleet to attack us.

                         PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
               We're picking up warnings for every
               American base in the Pacific.  Does this
               ambassador know the target?

                         AIDE
               Not for sure.  But he thinks it's Pearl
               Harbor.

                         PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
               Tell the Pentagon.

     The Aide leaves quickly and Roosevelt starts to get out of
     bed; his valet comes to help him.

                         PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
               No, George, I need the practice, in case
               there's a fire.

     Roosevelt drags himself out of bed, crawling toward the
     bathroom, his powerful arms dragging his lifeless legs.

     INT.  PENTAGON - DAY

     ADMIRALS and other OFFICERS are gathered around a giant map
     of the Pacific.

                         ADMIRAL
               The attack seems inevitable.  The
               question is where?  The way to answer
               that question is to ask:  if we were the
               Japanese, how would we do it?

     He nods to a VICE ADMIRAL, who stands over the map.

                         VICE ADMIRAL
               Between America and the Far East are the
               sea lanes where the winds and the
               currents make the best route for
               shipping.  Far above is the northern
               route, between Canada and Russia.
               Between these two is something they call
               the Vacant Sea.  If I were the Japs, I'd
               send a task force there.  You could hide
               the entire land mass of Asia in the
               Vacant Sea, and nobody would know.

                         ADMIRAL
               So they pop out and attack where?

                         VICE ADMIRAL
               That's the problem, Admiral.  They could
               hit anywhere they want.

     Nobody has any solution.

     EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

     A huge Japanese fleet steams toward Hawaii.  It is an awesome
     sight.  Carriers, battleships, destroyers, and entire battle
     group, traveling under complete radio silence, their hulls
     power through the waves.  On the lower decks of the carriers
     are hundreds of planes -- fighters and bombers.

     EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

     The American ships are lined up at anchor, calm, placid.

     EXT.  BEACH - DAY

     The sailors and soldiers bask in the sun, play volleyball.

     The aircraft carrier Lexington steams past toward the harbor
     entrance.

                         VOLLEYBALL PLAYER 1
               Where's the Lexington going?

                         VOLLEYBALL PLAYER 2
               Out on maneuvers, like the Enterprise.

     EXT.  GOLF COURSES - OAHU - DAY

     Men in military haircuts -- officers -- stroll the golf
     courses, enjoying themselves.

     INT.  DENTIST'S OFFICE - DAY

     The DENTIST, an ethnic Japanese, is working on a patient with
     his mouth agape.  The DENTIST ASSISTANT intrudes.

                         DENTAL ASSISTANT
               Dr. Takanawa, you have a call from Tokyo.

                         DENTIST
               Please excuse me.  Just relax.

     Leaving his patient with a mouth full of instruments, the
     Dentist moves to his outer office, which looks directly out
     over Pearl Harbor.  He speaks in Japanese.

                         DENTIST
               Takanawa... Yes?...

     He seems confused by the call, but he responds by looking out
     over the harbor, then saying into the receiver --

                         DENTIST
               Yes, they are all...no wait, I see the
               big one moving.  The one that's flat on
               top, what do they call it?...

     INT.  SURVEILLANCE BASE - DAY

     Some tired Army Intelligence types -- A LISTENER, a TRACKER,
     and an INTELLIGENCE SUPERVISOR, are sitting at a bank of
     phones.  The LISTENER is a Japanese-American.

                         LISTENER
               Here's something, over the line from
               Tokyo.

     He switches on the recording equipment and looks to the
     TRACER, sitting at a battery of equipment.

                         TRACER
               It's connected to a local dentist.  His
               office is beside Pearl Harbor.

                         INTELLIGENCE SUPERVISOR
               This dentist, is he a spy?

                         LISTENER
               Sounds too innocent.  His accent is from
               the old country.  Somebody official-
               sounding calls, he thinks it's
               discourteous not to respond.

     INT.  BARBER SHOP - DAY

     Admiral Kimmel is settling into the barber chair when his
     AIDE enters and nods for the barber to move a few paces away,
     so that he can speak privately.

                         AIDE
               Sir, we just had an intelligence
               intercept.  Someone from Tokyo called a
               local dentist whose office looks over
               Pearl.  They wanted to know the exact
               location of the ships.

                         ADMIRAL KIMMEL
               Someone from Tokyo asks a dentist how the
               ships are sitting... What are we supposed
               to do about that?

                         AIDE
               I...don't know, Sir.  But it just seemed
               significant.

                         ADMIRAL KIMMEL
               Have intelligence keep monitoring him.

     The Admiral sinks back into the chair.

     EXT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - DAY

     A young amateur PHOTOGRAPHER, about 16, wearing a hat with
     "PICTURES OF PARADISE" printed on it's crown is ready to snap
     a shot of Evelyn and her nurse friends having a picnic lunch
     on the lawn outside the hospital.

                         PHOTOGRAPHER
               Closer, ladies!  Closer!  Now smile!...
               Great!  Next week I'll show you a print
               and you can order your Pictures of
               Paradise!

     He hustles off.  Betty hands out picnic baskets.

                         BETTY
               Barbara, here's yours...and Evelyn, here
               you are.

     Evelyn opens her basket, and finds a lei of Hawaiian flowers
     stuffed in the top.  Betty scoots over and puts the flowers
     around Evelyn's neck.

                         BETTY
               It's been a month and you haven't smiled.
               We just want you to know we love you.

     Evelyn's touched -- but before she can react two P-40's zoom
     out of the skies, wings clipping the tops of the palm trees
     as they blast over head.

     INT.  COCKPIT'S OF THE P-40'S - DAY

     Danny and Anthony are the pilots; as they pull up and away,
     they pass over some officers on the golf course, scaring the
     shit out of them as they putt.

     EXT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - DAY

     The nurses have sprawled to the ground; now even Evelyn is
     smiling.

                         BARBARA
               What is it with nurses and pilots?

     EXT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - PEARL HARBOR - EVENING

     Evelyn walks out of the hospital.  She's still wearing her
     lei.  The sun is going down in a spectacular sunset.

     She stares at the orange glow at the edge of the world.  She
     breathes in the sea air, and tries to breathe out the
     sadness.  The water of the harbor laps close to where she
     stands, the sunset polishing its surface.

     She takes the lei from her neck, plucks a single flower, and
     holds it like the rose Rafe once gave her.  Then she tosses
     the rest of the lei into the ocean and watches it float away,
     as the sun sinks behind the horizon.

     INT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

     Evelyn finds her purse, and tucks the flower into it.  She's
     alone in the hospital, everyone else has gone; she turns her
     mind toward work, something to lose herself in.

     EXT.  MILITARY BASE - NEAR THE PILOTS' BARRACKS - DAY

     Danny is walking toward the barracks when a COLONEL hopping
     mad, confronts him.

                         COLONEL
               You're Walker, right?

                         DANNY
               Yes Sir.

                         COLONEL
               That was a nice little stunt you pulled,
               buzzing the base.

                         DANNY
               You liked that?

                         COLONEL
               Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting
               you out of the squadron.

                         DANNY
               Sir?

                         COLONEL
               I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you
               and your buddies are gonna transfer your
               planes up to Haleiwa.

                         DANNY
               Hale-what?

                         COLONEL
               You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just
               lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.

                         DANNY
               Sir, I --

                         COLONEL
               Too late for apologies, Walker.

                         DANNY
               I wasn't gonna apologize, Sir.  I was
               just gonna say it was worth it to feel
               like a real pilot again, even if it was
               only for five seconds.

     The Colonel glares at him and stalks away.

     INT.  BASE CANTEEN - NIGHT

     Danny and Evelyn are having coffee at the base canteen.

                         DANNY
               How's everything?

                         EVELYN
               We got some soldiers in traction from a
               jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except
               for the occasional fighter plane buzzing
               us.

                         DANNY
               That might not have been such a good
               idea.  They're making us fly out of a
               half-paved airfield.  The real punishment
               is that I won't be back to the barracks
               till it's too late for dinner or coffee.
               So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.

                         EVELYN
               I was just thinking that war is a series
               of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why
               we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to
               Rafe?

                         DANNY
               I swore not to talk about him tonight,
               but there's all this stuff I think I
               ought to tell you, that he didn't get a
               chance to.  Rafe was...he was lonely.  He
               had such high expectations of himself
               that he always felt empty.  The week he
               met you he told me he felt his heart had
               always lived in winter, and for the first
               time in his life he has seen the spring.

     He's been lost in his own thoughts of Rafe; now he notices
     the tears welling up in her eyes.

                         DANNY
               Sorry.

                         EVELYN
               He told me he didn't want to leave me
               with regret.  Now that's all I have.

                         DANNY
               Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?

                         EVELYN
               Well...sure.

                         DANNY
               From the air?

     EXT.  HALEIWA AIR FIELD - NIGHT

     A P-40 takes off from the remote airfield, lit only by the
     full moon.

     INT.  P-40 - NIGHT

     Evelyn sits on Danny's lap, like Rafe sat in his Daddy's lap
     years before.  Danny flies easily, the cockpit open, his arms
     slipped under hers.

     The sky above them is startlingly clear; a billion stars
     dancing around a full moon.

                         EVELYN
               So beautiful!

                         DANNY
               Hang on.

     He spins the plane in an easy half turn, inverting their
     heads above Pearl Harbor, gorgeous in the moonlight, the
     battleships aglow, the moon reflected in the peaceful water,
     embraced by the island of Oahu.

     EXT.  HALEIWA AIR FIELD - NIGHT

     The P-40 soars easily in and settles to earth.  Danny shuts
     down the engine.  Danny carefully removes the harness around
     her.  She looks overhead.  The stars are still bright above
     them.

                         EVELYN
               I didn't realize until tonight that I've
               stopped wanting to live.

     She turns in his lap, and looks at him.  Their eyes connect.
     Tentatively, almost reluctantly, they kiss.

     EXT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

     The POV of someone moving through the gathering darkness
     approaches the hospital.

     The lights from within the hospital, and the pristine white
     beds beneath those lights, give the place a kind of glow,
     where Evelyn moves alone and beautiful, like a ballerina in a
     giant's jewel box.

     Now we see the shoulders of the figure, from behind, and can
     tell that it is a man in uniform, but at first we can't tell
     who.  He's standing dead still, transfixed in watching Evelyn
     through the windows.

     INT.  BASE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

     Evelyn moves to her desk, and sits down.  She looks at the
     calender turning back to October, where she wrote on the
     square of October 22, "Order supplies" -- she counts the
     weeks from then to today, December 6.

     EXT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

     We see the full figure of the man watching her.  And now we
     see his face.  It is Rafe.

     His left hand is bandaged, but he is very much alive --
     though seeing Evelyn has taken his breath, and even seems to
     have robbed him of the power to move.  His eyes pick up every
     detail of her -- her face...her hands.

     And as Rafe watches Evelyn, he has the SUDDEN JOLTS OF
     SUBLIMINAL FLASHBACKS...punctuated by fragments of the letter
     she wrote to him, and INTERCUT with Rafe in the present,
     watching Evelyn.

                         EVELYN'S VOICE
               Dearest Rafe --

     IN SUBLIMINAL FLASHBACK, RAFE'S SPITFIRE, crippled and
     trailing smoke, passing through a patch of cloud as Rafe
     hurls himself from the cockpit and jerks the ripcord of his
     chute.

     IN THE PRESENT...Rafe's face winces with the memory, and he
     rivets his eyes on Evelyn, as if to force himself to know
     that this moment is real.

     SUBLIMINAL FLASHBACK...RAFE LANDS IN THE WATER, and the shock
     of its coldness travels up his body faster than his body
     sinks into the water.  He's cloaked in the fog; his
     parachute, pushed by the wind, is pulling him along face
     down.  He fights with the straps, flips himself over, and
     pulls the release...

     But he's still in desperate trouble; in his flying clothes,
     his heavy leather jacket soaking with sea-water, he's going
     down; his body sinks beneath the surface...

                         EVELYN'S VOICE
               ...Every sunset...

     IN THE PRESENT, Rafe's chest trembles... Is it from the
     memory of the frozen water, from the emotion of seeing Evelyn
     again -- or both?

     SUBLIMINAL FLASHBACKS -- Below the surface of the North Sea,
     Rafe's body drifts, but he fights his way back up...he kicks
     off his shoes, sheds the jacket, strips off his pants and
     starts tying the cuffs into knots.

     Then, in a CUT, he is floating in the water, his pants turned
     into a makeshift life preserver, his body shaking
     convulsively from the cold.

     Then in another CUT we see him after he's been in the water
     for so long that his body no longer trembles; he's lost
     consciousness.  He has no strength, no will to live... His
     face settles into the water...his body slips from his
     preserver, and drifts beneath the surface...

                         EVELYN'S VOICE
               ...gather it's heat into my heart, and
               send it to you...

     IN FLASHBACK, Rafe beneath the surface... His eyes come open.
     From his POV beneath the water, he sees something above the
     surface.  It's only in his mind, but that makes it no less
     real...an orange glow, the warmth of the sunset, and her face
     above the surface... His limbs come to life, and he fights
     his way up, breaking the surface.  The whole sea around him
     is dark and empty, but he grabs his makeshift preserver and
     holds on for dear life...and for Evelyn.

     IN THE PRESENT Rafe stares through the window, at Evelyn, but
     he can't go in.  He backs away from the window.

     INT.  PILOT'S BARRACKS - NIGHT

     A Japanese-American MESSAGE BOY parks his motorbike outside
     and enters the barracks.

                         MESSAGE BOY
               Daniel Walker?...

     Danny rises from his bunk and accepts the telegram.  As the
     message boy leaves, Danny reads... The news he learns stuns
     him...

     EXT.  BENCH - OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

     Rafe is still lost in thought.  He hears steps running up --
     and sees Danny -- who spots him at the same moment.

                         DANNY
               Rafe!

     INT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

     Evelyn puts away the calender.

     EXT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

     Rafe is sitting at the bench, his head down.

     ANGLE - Evelyn on the path; she sees someone on the bench,
     his form hauntingly familiar.  He hears her, and looks up.
     It's Rafe.

     From Evelyn's POV, the whole world spins.  She faints.

     Rafe jumps to catch her before she slams to the ground.  He
     gathers her into his arms, and she looks up into his face.
     He's real, very real.

                         RAFE
               Evelyn.

     She's trembling, shaking.  He lifts her to her feet, and
     moves her to the bench.

                         RAFE
               I sent telegrams, I guess the military
               traffic held them up.

                         EVELYN
               Why were you sitting here, instead of...

                         RAFE
               I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just
               stood there wondering if you knew.  You
               looked...sad, and I had to sit down a
               minute.

                         EVELYN
               How did you?...

                         RAFE
               ...Survive?  I jumped in a patch of fog,
               and nobody could see me.  I hit the water
               hard.  And it was so...cold.

     He looks toward the horizon, when the last light of day fades
     to black.  There's something he thinks about saying, and
     doesn't.  Then...

                         RAFE
               I don't know how long I was in the water.
               A Norwegian freighter picked me up.  They
               were headed to Spain.  They docked in La
               Rota, right beside a German ship, and
               told me to stay hidden below.  I was
               afraid they'd turn me in, so I stole some
               clothes, jumped ship, and found a church,
               where the priest contacted the
               resistance, and got me on a freighter to
               New York.

     He looks at her, then looks down again.

                         RAFE
               I called my folks, then Colonel
               Doolittle.  The Colonel sent a man to
               pick me up.  They wanted to debrief me.
               I told the Colonel I needed to see
               somebody first, and he had a supply
               flight heading out in an hour.
                    (beat)
               I've done a lot of talking.  You haven't
               said anything.

                         EVELYN
               I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know
               that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't
               you?

                         RAFE
               Nothing that won't heal.  I guess.

     At these words, she looks at him for a long, long moment.

                         EVELYN
               It's been...so different, being so sure
               you were dead.

                         RAFE
               I'm so sorry for what you must've gone
               through, but I'm back.

     He sees the troubled look on her face.

                         RAFE
               Maybe I've assumed too much.  Has
               something changed?
                    (beat)
               I'm afraid to ask what.  And I'm afraid
               not to.
                    (beat)
               Have you fallen in love?

     She nods; she can't even say it.  Rafe's dying inside.

                         RAFE
               It's all right.  Danny always said I see
               things with my emotions instead of my
               eyes.

                         EVELYN
               It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I
               wrote you, they --

                         RAFE
               Don't worry about that.  Guys away from
               home, lonely, good-hearted women try to
               cheer them up.

                         EVELYN
               It's not that I didn't mean everything I
               wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you
               were dead.  And now --

     Danny runs up, through the darkness.

                         DANNY
               You're alive!

     Rafe and Danny stare at each other; Danny hesitates, looking
     from Rafe to Evelyn, wondering what they've said.  Then Rafe
     looks at Evelyn, and picks up the look on her face.  In that
     moment he puts it all together.

                         RAFE
               Aw, God.  Oh my God.

     Danny's speechless, and for a moment Evelyn is too.

                         EVELYN
               Rafe --

     He puts up a hand, to silence her, and walks away suddenly.
     Evelyn and Danny are left frozen.

     EXT.  SHORE OF PEARL HARBOR - NIGHT

     Rafe stares out at the harbor, seeing nothing.  As he stands
     there alone and shattered, he has one more

     SUBLIMINAL FLASHBACK

     Rafe is in the water of the North Sea; he seems dead, but his
     makeshift preserver is keeping his face above the surface.
     Something slides through the water and stops beside him; it's
     a dinghy, and behind it is a trawler.

     Hands grab Rafe and drag him onto the dinghy...

     In a QUICK CUT, Rafe's body is laid out on the deck of the
     trawler.  The crewmen think he's dead.  His body is stiff,
     his lips white; and they say so, in Norwegian...

     But one of the other crewmen notices a quiver in his eyelid,
     then quickly covers Rafe with his on wool peacoat and presses
     back an eyelid to see his pupils.  Rafe's white lips move.
     The crewmen realize he's trying to say something.

     And Rafe does utter something, barely audible; something the
     Norwegian crewmen don't understand.

                         RAFE
               Evelyn...

     IN THE PRESENT Rafe struggles to bury that memory so far that
     he'll never feel it again.

     EXT.  NURSES' QUARTERS - NIGHT

     Danny escorts Evelyn back to her quarters.

                         DANNY
               Don't worry.  I'll find him.

     He hugs her; their embrace earnest yet tingled with guilt,
     and Danny leave quickly.  Betty steps out of the nurses'
     quarters and hands Evelyn a telegram.

                         BETTY
               This came while you were gone.

     Evelyn knows it's the telegram from Rafe, to tell her he's
     alive.  Without opening it, she begins to cry, and hurries
     away from the barracks so the other nurses won't see.

     EXT.  HICKAM FIELD - NIGHT

     Danny crosses the tarmac toward the clustered P-40's.  He
     spots what he's looking for.  Sitting in the cockpit of one
     of the P-40's is Rafe.  Rafe won't look at him.  Danny climbs
     up on the wing, and sits down there.

                         DANNY
               You'd always go sit in a plane whenever
               you were upset.

                         RAFE
               Upset?  Why should I be upset?

                         DANNY
               Let's go get a drink.  Unless you're
               scared to talk about it.

     CLOSE - A Mai-Tai volcano clunks onto a table.

     INT.  FUNKY OAHU BAR - DAY

                         DANNY
               Drink up.  Then we'll talk.

     Rafe takes the challenge, and takes a long pull on one of the
     straws.  Red, Anthony, Billy, and several others enter the
     bar.

                         ANTHONY
               Rafe?!

     They rush the table...

     INT.  FUNKY OAHU BAR - LATER

     They're all drinking, and the whole bar is rocking.  Rafe
     uses glasses to show his buddies tactics.

                         RAFE
               They'll go under you because their planes
               are faster, then they run so you can't
               catch 'em.  But then they'll come around
               and take you from behind -- like some
               Americans will.

     The last words bring the group to silence.  The other guys
     drift away, to give them room.

                         RAFE
               Sorry.

                         DANNY
               Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's
               better to come out with it.

                         RAFE
               I didn't mean it.

                         DANNY
               Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you
               think.

                         RAFE
               Waitress!  Four beers!

                         DANNY
               You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.

                         RAFE
               If you can't keep up, don't drink yours.

     The waitress delivers four bottles to the table.  Rafe takes
     a slow sip, then stares at Danny.

                         RAFE
               We gotta face some facts here.

                         DANNY
               What facts are those?

                         RAFE
               I understand how it could happen.  I know
               why any guy would love her.  And I can't
               blame you that it happened.  You thought
               I was dead, she was grieving, you were
               trying to help her.

                         DANNY
               I was grieving too.

                         RAFE
               Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.

                         DANNY
               So what are you saying?

                         RAFE
               I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time
               for you to fuck off.

                         DANNY
               You left her.  How's that for a fact?

                         RAFE
               How's this for a fact?  I loved her
               first.

     Danny takes a long pull of beer, and Rafe does the same.

                         DANNY
               You know, you're a lousy drinker.
               Drinking's supposed to make men feel
               bigger.  It only makes you stupid.  And
               weak.

     Rafe nods thoughtfully, and sets down his beer.

                         RAFE
               How's this?

     BAM!  He knocks Danny out of the chair, flat on his ass.
     Danny backhands the blood from the corner of his mouth.

                         DANNY
               You want it, you got it.

     He kicks Rafe in the back of the knee, then mule kicks him in
     the chest as he goes down, and the fight is on.

     The bar's bouncer, a big Samoan, moves over to break them up
     -- but Anthony steps in his way.

                         ANTHONY
               Let 'em fight, they need it.

     The bouncer tosses Anthony aside, but before he can move in
     to interrupt the fight, Red breaks a lava volcano of Mai-Tai
     over the bouncer's skull.  The bartender picks up the phone
     to call the M.P.'s.

     Rafe and Danny are exchanging punches in the middle of the
     room.  Sailors sitting at the bar have swung around on their
     stools to watch the action.  The other pilots are wincing
     with the punches their friends exchange, and bobbing and
     weaving as if in the fight themselves.  A SAILOR tapes Billy.

                         SAILOR
               Is this a private fight or can anybody
               jump in?

     Billy hits him.  The whole bar erupts.

     Rafe and Danny are really having at it, fueled by so much
     emotion that nothing hurts.  They're on the floor now, trying
     to rip each other apart.  They struggle to their feet and
     Rafe manages to knee Danny in the balls.  Danny doubles over
     in pain.

                         RAFE
               That hurt?  I didn't think you had any
               balls.

     Without looking up, Danny lunges at Rafe, tackling him around
     the waist, driving him at the wall.

     But they don't hit the wall; they tumble through the back
     window of the bar -- not covered in glass, but fronds and
     wood -- and out into the back alley.

     They're lying there in the debris when they see the M.P.
     jeeps coming.  They drag each other to their feet, and run
     away.

     EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT

     The Japanese task force rumbles through the night, the bows
     of the great ships blasting through the crashing waves.

     INT.  AIRCRAFT CARRIER AKAGI - NIGHT

     Yamamoto's flagship.  The clock reaches midnight, and a
     sailor tears off it's calender.  It's December 7, 1941.

                         YAMAMOTO
               The submarines will be reaching the
               harbor soon.  I hope they don't set off
               the alarm too soon.

     EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - NEAR PEARL HARBOR - NIGHT

     An American destroyer, the SELFRIDGE, leads a squadron of
     destroyers on patrol, near the entrance of Pearl Harbor.
     LOOKOUTS on the bridge think they spot something.

     INT.  CONTROL ROOM - DESTROYER SELFRIDGE - NIGHT

     The WATCH OFFICER listens to a report on his headset and
     turns to the CAPTAIN.

                         WATCH OFFICER
               Captain, lookouts report a sighting, two
               points off the starboard beam.

     The sonar operator looks up and nods.

                         SELFRIDGE CAPTAIN
               How big?

                         SONAR OPERATOR
               ...I've lost it.

                         SELFRIDGE CAPTAIN
               Probably a blackfish.  I've seen them
               look like subs.

     EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - NEAR PEARL HARBOR - NIGHT

     Another destroyer, the RALPH TALBOT, cruises behind the
     Selfridge.  On it's bridge, the DUTY OFFICER speaks to the
     CAPTAIN.

                         DUTY OFFICER
               Sir, Selfridge reports a contact, then
               lost it.  Now our sonar reports the
               contact.

     The Captain looks toward the Selfridge, then trains his
     binoculars on the water were the Duty Officer points.  He
     sees something dark and black slipping along beneath the
     surface.  He gets onto his intercom.

                         CAPTAIN OF THE RALPH TALBOT
               Radio room!  Raise the Selfridge.  Tell
               the Squadron Commander we have spotted a
               sub and request permission to depth
               charge.

     He looks again at the black shape, passing a few hundred
     yards from them.

                         CAPTAIN OF THE RALPH TALBOT
               We're five miles from Pearl Harbor and
               it's moving in from the open sea.
               Prepare to move to attack speed.

     The INTERCOM comes alive.

                         INTERCOM
               Sir, the Squadron Commander on Selfridge
               denies permission.

                         CAPTAIN OF THE RALPH TALBOT
               What?

                         INTERCOM
               Denies, Sir.  He says it's a blackfish.

     The Captain chokes back his frustration and shuts down the
     intercom -- but then he says to the Duty Officer, as they
     watch the shape disappear toward Pearl Harbor...

                         CAPTAIN OF THE RALPH TALBOT
               If it's a blackfish, it has a motorboat
               up it's ass!

     EXT.  OAHU - ROAD - NIGHT

     Danny has pulled his Buick convertible off the road; Rafe is
     bent over, his head out of frame; he's throwing up.  Danny's
     banged up from the fight and still drunk himself; he waits
     beside Rafe, who chokes out between heaves --

                         RAFE
               How come you're not pukin'?

                         DANNY
               I guess I'm used to it.  I've felt like
               throwing up every minute since you got
               back.

     Rafe straightens up, but the waves of sickness come back over
     him and he bends over again.  Danny looks at his friend, and
     the pain is written on Danny's face.

                         DANNY
               Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like
               you're thinking.

                         RAFE
                    (between heaves)
               Fuck you.

                         DANNY
               She loves you.  I know that.  And part of
               what she loves in me is how much of you
               she sees in me.

     Rafe doesn't seem to be listening; but Danny knows he is.

                         DANNY
               We were both torn up.  I started dropping
               by to see her, because we understood what
               each other felt.  We'd have coffee and
               try not to talk about you, but we always
               would.

     Rafe stands to face Danny; this is hard for Danny to say.

                         DANNY
               She said I was so much like you.  I said,
               No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of
               you, but I'm not you, not as good as you.
               Everybody else saw me as a loser with a
               big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw
               the better part of me, the part of me
               that could be like you, and changed me.
               You made me who I am.

                         RAFE
               How sweet.  Is that when you put the move
               on her?

     Danny slams his fist into Rafe's sick gut.  Rafe doubles over
     again, coughing, nothing left in his belly to come up.

     Rafe stand slowly, nodding as if he knows the punch was what
     he deserved.  Danny's about to apologize when once more Rafe
     knees him in the balls.

     Danny folds up, drops to his knees, and starts to retch.

                         RAFE
               That's better.

     Rafe crawls into the back seat of the car and passes out,
     Danny still collapsed at the side of the road.

     EXT.  PACIFIC - NIGHT

     The Japanese task force storms on.

     INT.  JAPANESE AIRCRAFT CARRIERS - NIGHT

     IN THE PREP DECKS, the planes are being armed with bombs and
     torpedoes.

     IN THE PILOTS' QUARTERS, the pilots individually sit before
     personal shrines, saying private prayers, writing letters.

     EXT.  JAPANESE CARRIERS - FLIGHT DECKS - NIGHT

     The planes are brought up on the elevators; deck crewmen
     start rolling them into position.

     EXT.  UNDER THE SURFACE OF THE PACIFIC - NIGHT

     A Japanese submarine with a midget sub attached to its hull
     runs silently toward Pearl Harbor.

     EXT.  OCEAN SURFACE - NIGHT

     The periscope of the submarine breaks the surface.

     INT.  JAPANESE SUB - NIGHT

     The sub commander looks through the periscope and sees the
     lights of Oahu far in the distance.

                         SUB COMMANDER
               Prepare to launch midget sub.

     INT.  BUNK AREA OF SUB, BETWEEN TORPEDOES - NIGHT

     The sailor who will drive the midget sub completes his
     ceremonial sponge bath, and places a handwritten letter on
     his personal shrine.

                         SAILOR'S VOICE (LETTER)
               My revered father, I go now to fulfill my
               mission and my destiny.

     INT.  THE LAUNCH OF THE MIDGET SUB - NIGHT

     We see the sub surface, and the sailor exit the main hatch of
     the big sub, then force himself through the tiny hatch of the
     midget sub.

                         SAILOR'S VOICE (LETTER)
               I hope it is a destiny that will bring
               honor to our family, and if it requires
               my life I will sacrifice it gladly, if
               you can think of me and my hope to be a
               good servant of our nation, and a worthy
               son.  With love and devotion, Kazuyoshi.

     EXT.  FLIGHT DECK, JAPANESE CARRIER - NIGHT

     A single scout plane launches into the air.

     INT.  SCOUT PLANE - NIGHT

     The plane climbs to a high altitude, toward the dawn and
     Pearl Harbor.

     EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT

     The Japanese carriers turn into the wind and raise combat
     pennants.  A color guard raises the Japanese flag as the deck
     crew stand at attention, seeing the rising-sun flag snap
     potently in the wind.

     EXT.  JAPANESE AIRCRAFT CARRIERS - NIGHT

     The first wave of Japanese planes begins to launch.  It is a
     stirring sight for the Japanese; the pilots waiting in their
     cockpits, the officers watching from the bridge, the seamen
     on the flight deck.

     The first plane taxis along the flight deck and lifts into
     the sky.  The seamen cheer and wave their caps.

     EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - NEAR PEARL HARBOR - NIGHT

     The American destroyer WARD cuts through the water, moving
     back into port after a night patrol.  It's CAPTAIN is on the
     bridge, and its lookouts are still scanning the waters.

                         LOOKOUT
               Captain, do you see that, in our wake?

     The Captain raises his binoculars and looks out behind the
     ship.  He sees something small and black there.

                         CAPTAIN OF THE WARD
               That's a conning tower.

                         OFFICER
               Could it be one of ours?

                         CAPTAIN OF THE WARD
               He's trying to follow us through the sub
               nets, into the harbor.  Sink the son of a
               bitch.

     EXT.  DECK OF THE DESTROYER WARD - NIGHT

     The deck gun barks, aimed toward the conning tower of the
     Japanese sub in the distance.  The first shot sails directly
     over the tower, missing.

     INT.  THE SUB'S CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

     The Japanese sub commander sees, through his periscope, the
     flame erupt on the Ward's deck; he's being fired upon.  He
     snaps orders --

                         JAPANESE SUB CAPTAIN
               Dive!  Dive!

     EXT.  THE DECK OF THE WARD - NIGHT

     The gunners snap in another shell and fire again.  It's a
     direct hit, the sub is ripped apart, it rolls over.

     INT.  WARD'S BRIDGE - NIGHT

     The Captain watches the sub sinking and snaps an order.

                         CAPTAIN OF THE WARD
               Fleet command, from destroyer Ward.  Have
               fired upon and sunk enemy submarine
               seeking to enter Pearl Harbor.

     EXT.  ESTABLISHING - RADAR STATION - PEARL HARBOR - DAWN

     INT.  RADAR STATION - PEARL HARBOR - DAWN

     There are two guys left in the room, yawning over their new
     radar equipment.  The Officer, ELLIS, checks his watch; it's
     a few minutes after seven a.m.

                         ELLIS
               Time to shut her down.  That was a good
               first session.  You'll get the hang of
               this new radar soon.

                         PRIVATE
               Thank you, Sir.  Hey...what's this?

     His screen shows a huge cloud of blips, heading toward them.

                         ELLIS
               I've never seen anything like that
               before.

     He gets on the telephone.

     INT.  ARMY HEADQUARTERS - DAWN

     The phone rings and an officer answers.

                         OFFICER
               Watch command... Coming from which
               direction?... Hold on.

     He covers the phone and tells his commander --

                         OFFICER
               Radar station has picked up a cloud of
               blips, coming in from the northeast.

     He switches on the radio, and tunes it to KGMB; hearing the
     Hawaiian music reassures him something...

                         COMMANDER
               KGMB is on early.  That means we've got a
               flight of B-17's coming in from the
               mainland, they use the radio music for a
               homing beacon.

     INT.  RADAR STATION - PEARL HARBOR - DAWN

     Dismayed, Ellis listens to the response from the
     headquarters.

                         ELLIS
               All right, Sir.
                    (he hangs up)
               They say don't worry about it.

     He and the private look again at the cloud of blips --
     growing ever larger, and moving in fast.

     EXT.  THE SKIES ABOVE THE PACIFIC - DAY

     The Japanese formations are streaking through the sky.

     INT.  THE COCKPITS - DAY

     The Japanese bombers, with three-man crews, are listening to
     the Hawaiian music of the radio station, using it for their
     homing beacon.  They look out and see the sunrise -- it's
     beautiful, and resembles the Japanese flag.

     EXT.  SKIES ABOVE PEARL HARBOR - DAWN

     The Japanese scout plane is high in the air.  It radios --

                         SCOUT PLANE PILOT
               Harbor quiet.  Ships in place.  Carriers
               gone.

     INT.  BRIDGE OF YAMAMOTO'S CARRIER - DAY

     Yamamoto is handed this message.

                         YAMAMOTO
               We have achieved surprise, but their
               carriers are not in port.  I don't like
               this.

                         GENDA
               We have a fighter screen up, in case we
               are attacked, Admiral.

                         YAMAMOTO
               We must go ahead.  This is our moment.

     INT.  ADMIRAL KIMMEL'S HOME - DAY

     The Admiral, dressed in his golf clothes, is leaving his home
     when a naval LIEUTENANT appears at his door.

                         LIEUTENANT
               Admiral, one of our destroyers reports
               sinking a sub on its way into Pearl.

                         ADMIRAL KIMMEL
               Relay that to Washington...and cancel my
               golf game.

     INT.  ADMIRAL KIMMEL'S OFFICE - OAHU - DAY

     Kimmel enters his office, and is handed the latest
     dispatches.

                         ADMIRAL KIMMEL
               Any response from Washington?

                         KIMMEL'S AIDE
               Nothing, Sir.

     EXT.  WESTERN UNION OFFICE - PEARL HARBOR - DAY

     A telegram, addressed to Admiral Kimmel, lands in the
     regular, not urgent, dispatch box.  The messenger handles it
     promptly, hopping on his motorbike to deliver it.

     EXT.  SKIES ABOVE THE PACIFIC - DAY

     The Japanese planes increase throttle and nose down, diving
     toward the surface, hurtling into attack mode.

     EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

     The harbor lies quiet.  It's a sleepy Sunday morning.
     Children are playing, officers are stepping from their houses
     in their shorts to get the morning paper...

     EXT.  MOUNTAINSIDE - OAHU - DAY

     Hawaiian Boy Scouts are hiking on a side of one of the
     mountains overlooking Pearl.

     Suddenly booming over the mountain, barely ten feet above the
     summit, comes a stream of planes.

     The boys are awed.  What is this?

     EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

     QUICK INTERCUTS - Between the approach of the Japanese
     planes, and sleepy Pearl Harbor...

     -- The planes, in formation, their propellers spinning, their
        engines throbbing...

     -- Pearl Harbor, with the ships silent, their engines cold,
        their anchors steady on the harbor bottom.

     -- The Japanese submarines heading in.

     -- The American destroyers docking, instead of going out to
        search for them.

     -- Another formation of Japanese bombers climbing high, into
        attack position.

     -- The Japanese torpedo planes dropping down to the level of
        the ocean, their engines beginning to scream.

     -- The American planes bunched on the airfields.

     -- ON THE JAPANESE CARRIERS, Yamamoto and his staff huddle
        tensely, over their battle maps.

     ON THE JAPANESE CARRIER DECKS, the second wave of planes is
     being brought up and loaded with munitions...the Japanese
     flag snaps tautly in the wind...

     ON THE GOLD COURSE NEAR PEARL HARBOR, American officers are
     laughing on the putting green near the club house, where the
     American flag droops from the flag pole, limply at peace.

     -- The Japanese planes roaring down just over the wave tops
        of Pearl Harbor itself.

     -- Children playing in the early morning sun, looking up as
        they see the planes flash by.  The children look --
        they've never seen this many, flying this low...but they
        are not alarmed, only curious.

     The images come faster and faster, the collision of Japan's
     determination and American's innocence...

     EXT.  DECK OF OKLAHOMA - DAY

     Two sailors are standing on the deck, sharing a smoke,
     looking out over the quiet harbor.  One of them sees the
     first few planes streaking in.

                         SAILOR 1
               Look at that.

                         SAILOR 2
               It's the Army again, practicing on us.

     Something drops from the lead plane and splashes easily into
     the water; the plane banks away.

                         SAILOR 2
               Practice torpedoes.

     A white streak runs through the water at them.

                         SAILOR 2
               Now listen, you'll hear a little thud
               when it hits the side of the ship.

     They watch it rush at them...then, a MASSIVE EXPLOSION!  It
     throws up a fifty foot wall of water, hurling the sailors and
     everything else on the deck into the sea.

     EXT.  THE ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR - DAY

     -- The first wave of planes drop more torpedoes; they plunge
        BENEATH THE SURFACE, their wooden fins working perfectly,
        the torpedoes speeding to their targets...

     We see their AWESOME BLASTS against the anchored ships as the
     torpedoes hit home.

     -- The Japanese LOW ALTITUDE BOMBERS come in; some drop their
        bombs directly into the ships; some skip their bombs
        across the water, the bombs glancing off the surface and
        then slamming the sides of battleships with tremendous
        explosions.

     -- INSIDE THE SHIPS, sleeping sailors are thrown from their
        bunks; those already awakened run for their battle
        stations, and try to make it up to the deck; but there's
        no escape there, as...

     -- Zero fighter planes strafe the ships, raking the decks and
        killing sailors with MACHINE GUN FIRE.

     EXT.  ON THE AMERICAN SHIPS - DAY

     Fire and smoke are turning everything into chaos.  some
     sailors rush to man the guns, they find the ammo boxes
     locked.

     Under the bombing and strafing, they find a wrench and start
     pounding on the lock, trying to break open the ammo box.
     Then they break open the lock -- and find the ammo box empty.

                         SAILOR
               Shit!  I'll get some ammo!

     He runs for the ladders, and is shot down before he gets
     there.

     EXT.  SKIES OVER PEARL HARBOR - DAY

     The dive bombers scream in.

     EXT.  DECK OF THE WEST VIRGINIA - DAY

     Bombs are hitting the deck.  Sailors are blown into the air
     and out into the oily water.  Nearby ships are catching fire;
     the flames spread out onto the oily water itself.

     INT.  BELOW DECKS OF THE WEST VIRGINIA - DAY

     Dorie Miller, the boxing champion/kitchen helper, is working
     picking up the breakfast trays when he feels the ship
     shudder.  The intercom comes alive --

                         INTERCOM
               Battle stations!  Battle stations!  This
               is not a drill!

     Men run to the ladders, and the shaking of the ship from a
     bomb blast tosses them off; Dorie's at the foot of the ladder
     when men fall back on top of him.

     EXT.  BRIDGE OF WEST VIRGINIA - DAY

     The Captain of the ship has reached the command bridge, where
     most of his staff is lying wounded from a bomb blast.

                         CAPTAIN OF THE WEST VIRGINIA
               Stay calm!  Find your positions.  Medics,
               get the wounded to sick bay!  Load and --

     MORE TORPEDOES and BOMBS blast into the ship.  A big chunk of
     shrapnel tears into the Captain and rips his stomach open.
     The medics he was just directing to other men now run to him,
     as the men they were going to help have been blown apart.

     EXT.  DECK OF THE WEST VIRGINIA - DAY

     Sailors run up from below and are gunned down and blasted
     down before they can reach their weapons.

     Dorie Miller emerges from below decks and sees the carnage,
     the confusion.  A bloody OFFICER grabs him.

                         BLOODY OFFICER
               Boy!  We need stretcher bearers on the
               bridge!

     Dorie runs into the fire and smoke, toward the bridge.

     EXT.  BRIDGE OF THE WEST VIRGINIA - DAY

     Dorie arrives to see the medics crouched over the
     disemboweled Captain, who is still giving orders.

                         CAPTAIN OF THE WEST VIRGINIA
               Radio for air cover.  Organize the other
               medics.  Initiate fire control.

     Dorie helps the medic lift the Captain to take him below.

     INT.  BELOW DECKS OF THE WEST VIRGINIA - DAY

     Dorie carries the Captain down the ladder by himself, using
     one arm to climb and one to hold the Captain like a child's
     teddy bear.  When they reach the bottom the pain has grown
     too much for the Captain; he know's he's dying.

                         CAPTAIN OF THE WEST VIRGINIA
               Put me down here.

     Dorie puts him down; the medic jumps down the ladder and
     reaches the Captain, who tells him --

                         CAPTAIN OF THE WEST VIRGINIA
               Find my executive officer and tell him
               he's in command.  Tell him to fire the
               boilers and...

     He trembles in death throes...

                         CAPTAIN OF THE WEST VIRGINIA
               Make sure the gunners have enough
               ammuni --

     He's dead.  The Medic runs toward the ladder, reaches the
     hatch, and is blasted back to the bottom by an explosion
     overhead.

     Dorie runs for the ladder, and climbs out into hell.

     EXT.  DECK OF THE WEST VIRGINIA - DAY

     Dorie emerges into even greater carnage and confusion.  A
     sailor, his body on fire, runs past and leaps into the oily
     water -- but it is in flames too.

     Then Dorie sees it:  an unmanned anti-aircraft gun.  He runs
     to it, through the strafing.

     The gun already has a belt of ammo in it -- apparently loaded
     by the gunner who lies beside it with his chest shot open.
     Dorie swings the business end of the gun toward the Zeros
     coming in out of the smoke, and he begins to fire.

     The Zeros keep coming and he keeps firing; nothing on earth
     will knock him from that gun.

     INT.  NURSES' BARRACKS - DAY

     Evelyn is up, dressed; her roommates are just stirring.

     EXT.  NURSES' QUARTERS - OAHU - DAY

     Evelyn has stepped to the door when she hears a distant
     rumble and looks across the harbor to see smoke rising, ships
     taking hits.

                         EVELYN
               Oh my God... EVERYBODY TO THE HOSPITAL!

     As she runs, Japanese planes are coming toward the base.

     EXT.  THE MESS HALL AT HICKAM FIELD - DAY

     The men were sitting down to breakfast, but the machine gun
     bullets tearing up the outer walls have them clogging the
     doors, and it's so clogged they can't all get out.

     A steel bomb crashes through the roof and slams through the
     room, taking out tables and chairs before bouncing off the
     wall and coming to a stop.

     TWO SOLDIERS, trapped within the mess hall, see it stop
     without detonating.  They are bug-eyed, hearts stopped.

                         MESS HALL SOLDIER
               Dud.

     The bomb detonated, blowing everything to bloody dust.

     INT.  HOSPITAL - DAY

     Evelyn reaches the hospital first and runs to the cabinet,
     withdrawing supplies.

     Barbara and Sandra appear at the far door, both terrified.

                         EVELYN
               Get everything out!  Bandages, sutures --
               oh God, the men in traction... Come with
               me!

     She races into the hallway, the other two following.

     INT.  HOSPITAL - TRACTION WARD - DAY

     Four men from a jeep accident are lying in traction, their
     casted limbs roped in the air.  Evelyn runs in, grabbing a
     razor blade from the medical cabinet -- and telling Barbara
     and Sandra.

                         EVELYN
               Cut them down, and take cover!!  Hurry!

     Bombs are falling outside, on the airfield this wing of the
     hospital faces.  Evelyn slices the traction ropes of a man
     with both legs broken; ignoring his groans, she rolls him out
     of the bed and covers him with the mattress.  The other
     nurses follow her lead.  The bombs are coming toward the
     hospital ward; Evelyn finishes with the fourth man and covers
     him and herself with the mattress, just as a bomb craters
     outside the window.

     The nurses and patients look up after the explosions have
     passed; there's a chunk of smoking shrapnel lying on the
     springs of the bunk where the last man had been lying.

     EXT.  HICKAM FIELD - DAY

     The Japanese low-altitude bombers, with Zero escorts, zoom in
     over the field, blasting the clusters of American warplanes,
     whole squadrons taken out with one bomb.

     The mechanics and pilots, caught in the open, run from the
     strafing.  The Zeros rake them down with machine gun fire.
     It's carnage.

     EXT.  PHOTOGRAPHER'S HOUSE - DAY

     Sammy, the amateur photographer, is leaving his house for a
     morning of working his "Pictures of Paradise" business, when
     he sees the Japanese formations rumbling toward Pearl.  He
     races back inside.

     INT.  PHOTOGRAPHER'S HOUSE - DAY

     He fishes into his drawer for a film camera, and digs out
     cans of film, struggling to load it as he runs back out.

     INT.  HICKAM FIELD - BARRACKS - DAY

     The pilots of Danny's squadron have returned from their night
     of drinking and brawling and are crashed on their bunks.  Red
     stirs and staggers toward the head; he bumps into the wall,
     backs up like a wind-up toy and lurches blindly forward
     again, into --

     INT.  BARRACKS - THE HEAD - DAY

     Red sleepwalks to the urinals and unleashes a marathon piss
     stream, still in his sleep.  A rumble penetrates his brain,
     and his eyes come open a fraction.  Through the window slits
     above the urinals, he can see a cloud of Japanese planes
     rushing past.

     He squeezes his eyes shut, and looks again; the planes start
     bombing the distant hangers.

     Red pisses along the wall as he races to the barracks, trying
     to get his pecker back into his drawers.  He shouts to the
     sleeping guys --

                         RED
               Th-th-th-th-th-

     He slaps his face with both hands, and stomps his feet...

                         RED
               Th-th-th-th-Dammit!  Th-th-th-

     He still can't get it out, can't wake them; bursting with
     frustration, he suddenly blasts out singing --

                         RED
                    (singing)
               The Jaaaps!!  The Jaaaps!!

     He's belting it like a baritone in a bizarre opera.  His
     friends stir; what the hell?  Red points outside and tries to
     talk, but now he can't mutter a syllable.  The guys hear the
     explosions, and realize...

     EXT.  HICKAM FIELD - BARRACKS - DAY

     The pilots stagger out, half drunk, half dressed.  Seeing
     what's happening, they race toward the flight line, where the
     clustered American planes are blowing up in groups, and the
     pilots are knocked to the ground.

                         BILLY
               Goddamn Japs!

     Billy jumps to his feet and starts to run toward a cluster of
     fighters that hasn't gone up yet.

                         ANTHONY
               Billy!

     Anthony tries to grab him and drag him back to earth but he
     misses; Billy gets a few steps before the fire from a
     strafing Zero catches up to him; his friends watch in horror
     as Billy gets shorter as he runs; the Zero's machine gun fire
     is sawing his legs off from the feet up.

     Billy falls, legless but still alive; then a bomb falls
     almost on top of him, sending body parts over the pilots.

     Their innocence, like America's, is gone in that moment.

     EXT.  ROAD TO MAIN AIRFIELD - DAY

     Danny and Rafe are in Danny's Buick, hung over and asleep,
     Danny in front, Rafe in back, and they're a miserable sight
     -- their shirts ripped, blood dried in a leak trail from one
     side of Rafe's nose and the corner of Danny's mouth.

     The rumble of planes moving overhead makes them stir; the
     rumble grows huge, as the shadows of a massive formation
     makes the sunlight flicker.  Danny and Rafe squint up, their
     heads pounding, and realize what they're seeing.  Suddenly
     their headaches are gone, and Danny's gunning the Buick down
     the road, toward the base.

     EXT.  AIR BASE - DAY

     Danny blasts through the main gate; the guards are too busy
     taking cover and haven't even closed the barrier.

     He races to the tarmac, where some of the planes are still
     undamaged.  Rafe is out the door before the car stops
     rolling, and Danny's right behind him.

     They're running toward a cluster of fighters, when it goes up
     with a bomb blast.  Rafe and Danny dive at each other; their
     first instinct is to cover their best friend with their own
     bodies.

     They look at each other on the ground.  They see machine gun
     bullets thudding into the planes on the flight line, and
     ripping along the walls of the buildings.  It's as if the
     whole Japanese airforce is attacking this one base, and not
     leaving a single plane airworthy.

                         RAFE
               Get me into a plane!

                         DANNY
               Come on!

     Danny sprints; Rafe follows.  Danny reaches a phone booth,
     and digs a dime from his pants.

                         RAFE
               You're making a phone call?!

     Danny dials, as waves of bullets sweep the area, and more
     planes blow up on the flight line.  Rafe thinks he's lost his
     mind.

                         DANNY
                    (into phone)
               This is Walker!  We're under attack!  Get
               those planes fueled and armed RIGHT NOW!

     He runs back toward the car; Rafe, in the nonsense of battle,
     reaches in to hang up the receiver, before Danny grabs him
     and leads him on a sprint to the car, as the phone booth
     shatters behind them from the strafing.

     On the way to the car they dive back to the ground to avoid
     strafing -- and see their friends lying nearby, in shock.

                         ANTHONY
               They got Billy.

                         DANNY
               Come with us!

     He and Rafe jump up and run again.  Anthony, Red, and several
     other pilots reach the Buick and dive in.  Danny drives away,
     through the strafing.

                         RAFE
               Where are we going?

                         DANNY
               Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles
               north of here.

                         RAFE
               What's there?

                         DANNY
               Six P-40's.

     As the Zero pilots see the Buick moving, they go after it.
     Danny drives like a madman through the strafing, zigzagging
     and gunning the Buick's V-8.

     EXT.  THE OKLAHOMA - STILL AT ANCHOR - DAY

     The number of attacking planes seems endless -- and their
     strategy flawless.  Torpedoes hitting one ship lifts its hull
     with a blast, enabling the next wave of torpedoes to rush
     under and hit the next ship anchored behind.  The American
     battleships are bobbing like see-saws.

     The OKLAHOMA takes an entire barrage of torpedoes, blowing
     thirty foot holes along it's hull; the ship immediately
     begins to list.

     INT.  THE OKLAHOMA - DAY

     Doors are wedged shut by the deformation of the structure;
     vertical ladders are becoming horizontal, and water is
     pouring in.  Men fight their way up against the water.

     INT.  INNER COMPARTMENT OF THE OKLAHOMA - DAY

     Water is up to the trapped sailor's waists when they grab a
     wrench and start taking turns pounding S.O.S. in Morse code
     on the bulkhead.

     EXT.  DECK OF OKLAHOMA - DAY

     As the listing grows more severe, sailors start jumping from
     the deck into the water.  Still the Marines on deck are
     firing back at the planes; some Marines are even using
     handguns.  But courage does not save them...

     THE OKLAHOMA ROLLS OVER

     The men still on its deck try to run, but it's not just the
     fires and the water they can't escape; the gun turrets' 1400
     pound shells break loose with the capsizing of the ship and
     tumble through everything like massive wrecking balls.

     The sailors and marines, thrown into the water, struggle to
     get away from the suction as the giant battleship turns
     turtle.

     BELOW THE WATER men are sucked down with amazing force, every
     hair on their heads streaming behind them as they're snatched
     to the depths.

     INSIDE THE OKLAHOMA, everyone and everything is spilling
     upside down.  The ship's generators sputter out and the
     lights go out.  The flashlights of the few sailors who can
     find them cut raggedly through the darkness, and water spills
     in.  There is no escape.

     BELOW THE WATER, the Oklahoma's superstructure hits bottom;
     some men are crushed there.  For others it's salvation, as
     the BACKWASH blows them toward the surface.

     ON THE SURFACE the men are launched almost completely out of
     the water, before splashing back into the water and burning
     oil.  A few feet of the steel hull and a portion of the
     propeller protrude above the surface, but most of the
     Oklahoma is under water.

     Men in the water swim toward a medical launch carrying
     wounded away from the wreckage.  A bomb hits the launch and
     blows body parts everywhere.

     INT.  OKLAHOMA - REAR COMPARTMENT

     In one compartment there are a dozen trapped men.  They've
     survived the roll-over, and are in a chaotic world where the
     floor is now the ceiling.  The water is up their waists.
     Some of the SAILORS are panicking.

     One sailor has a flashlight and switches it on, flashing the
     light from face to face.

                         SAILOR WITH THE FLASHLIGHT
               Don't panic!  Don't panic!

                         PANICKED SAILOR
               The water's rising!  It's coming up,
               we're all gonna drown!

                         SAILOR WITH THE FLASHLIGHT
               The air pressure will equalize it!

     But the water keeps rising, along with their fears.  Several
     of the sailors are still screaming...

     The water's already to their bellies.  One of them grabs a
     wrench and starts slamming Morse code against the bulkhead.

     One sailor in the middle of the room is particularly
     panicked, not just yelling but crying and whimpering --

                         TERRIFIED SAILOR
               Get me out!  Get me out!

                         SAILOR WITH THE FLASHLIGHT
               Stop it!  Come on!  Save your air!

                         TERRIFIED SAILOR
               MY FOOT'S CAUGHT!

     He's at the lower end of the compartment, where the water is
     deeper -- the ship's nose is lower than her stern.  The
     water's up to the guy's neck.

     The man with the flashlight dives down, and finds the guys
     foot wedged together in the pipes of the ships ceiling -- now
     their floor.

     He pops up again.  The water's up to the trapped guy's mouth;
     he's already gagging.

                         SAILOR WITH THE FLASHLIGHT
               Is there a hacksaw in that locker?!

     They open it; tools spill out -- among them is a hacksaw.
     They hand it to him; the sailor dives down and cuts off the
     guy's foot.

     The trapped man is underwater, muffling his scream.  He comes
     free, and surfaces gasping.  His severed foot floats to the
     surface and then the horror really hits them.  The sailor
     with the flashlight pops up, in the blossoming of blood.  He
     and another sailor tie a tourniquet around the stump, to stop
     the bleeding.

     The drama of this has caused the other trapped men to stop
     their signaling.  Now they start banging, twice as loudly as
     before.

     EXT.  HALEIWA - AUXILIARY AIRFIELD - DAY

     Haleiwa is a tiny airfield, tucked among the green volcanic
     hills; its barely paved, and it's only permanent building is
     a quonset hut.  A mechanic named EARL, is out with the
     P-40's; and these are spread out, not bunched.

     EARL AND THE P-40'S

     The planes here have received loving care from Earl -- which
     means lots of cursing; as he's wrestling to load an ammo
     belt, he yells.

                         EARL
               Sum-bitch!

     The Buick, bullet holes punched through the truck, slides to
     a stop near the planes, and the pilots jump out.

                         DANNY
               They ready, Earl?

                         EARL
               They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...

     What stops him is the cloud of Zeros and dive bombers,
     shrieking in.

                         DANNY
               Cover!

     The guys scatter.  There are sandbags around the hut, and
     they run there, diving into it's shelter just before the
     first strafing pass, when a Zero strafes one of the P-40's
     and a dive bomber blasts another.  Earl stands up in shock
     and fury.

                         EARL
               You absolute mother-fuckin' son of a
               bitch!  You shot one of my planes!

     Danny pulls him down, as the Zeros roar overhead.

                         DANNY
               This ain't a little feud, Earl, it's
               World War Two!

                         RAFE
               They're coming around for another pass.
               You got extra weapons and ammo?

                         EARL
               Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun
               lockers!

                         DANNY
               You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come
               with me!

     Danny, Rafe and Earl run to the planes that got hit and strip
     out the 20mm cannons and ammo.

     INT.  QUONSET HUT - DAY

     The other pilots run in, throw open the gun locker, and start
     grabbing weapons -- aircraft machine guns, ammo belts, one
     even grabs a rifle.

     SANDBAGS BY THE SHED

     The two groups run back and start to set up.

                         RAFE
               Danny, over there!  We're in a canyon,
               they'll come straight down it, we'll get
               'em in a crossfire.

     Danny, Rafe and Earl run to a gully opposite the shed and set
     up there, as the other pilots brace the machine guns against
     the sandbags.

     The Japanese planes attacks again.  This time the lead plane
     hits a wall of steel fired from the combined guns; the
     bullets chew into the bomb it carries and the plane EXPLODES.
     The airborne debris makes the following planes shear off.

     Red's standing, firing; he yells at the Zeros --

                         RED
               D-don't like it when we fight back, do
               ya!

     Red runs out with his machine gun and keeps firing even when
     the planes have passed, trying to shoot them right up the
     ass.

                         DANNY
               Earl!  You said the planes were ready
               but -- but what?

                         EARL
               Of the four left, only one is full of
               fuel.

                         RAFE
               Will the others get into the air?

     Earl shoots a look to Rafe, then turns to Danny.

                         EARL
               Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.

                         DANNY
               Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma,
               you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come
               with us!  Earl, you get on the radio!
               We're gonna fight these fuckers.

     Two of the pilots, Joe and Theo, run to Danny.

                         JOE
               How do we do it?

                         DANNY
               Your call, Rafe.

                         RAFE
               Get rolling as fast as you can.  Stay
               low!  We'll use the topography to
               separate them and then we can take 'em
               one on one.

     They race toward the planes, and the Japanese attack again.
     Seeing the pilots running for the P-40's, the Zeros aim for
     them; Rafe and Danny race for the most distant of the planes;
     Joe and Theo run for the closer planes, through the dusty
     bullet hits.

     Theo makes his plane and is just strapping himself in when
     bullets stitch his fuselage, wounding him.  He still forces
     the plane forward.  He taxis twenty feet and his cockpit gets
     chopped up and the plane arches into a right turn and putters
     to a stop, Theo dead at the controls.

     Joe doesn't bother to strap in; he hits the throttle hard and
     heads down the runway...

     The Zeros are on him as he gets ten feet of air at 120 M.P.H.
     The Zero's bullets eat his canopy and plane skin; the plane
     breaks apart in mid air, spilling in gouts of flame as it
     smashes down on the tarmac.

     Rafe and Danny have reaches the more distant P-40's and are
     revving their engines as they see Joe and Theo's fate.  They
     throw on their radio headsets.

     Their way seems blocked:  they've got no runway behind them,
     the wreckage of four P-40's scattered ahead of them, and the
     Zeros screaming over the low hills to attack them.  Now Rafe
     and Danny talk through the radio.

                         DANNY
               It's tight.

                         RAFE
               Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season.
               Don't hit the barn.

     They gun their engines and roll through the grass on either
     side of the runway, dodging the burning planes; they lift
     off, clearing the quonset hut by a couple of inches.  They
     blow right through the strafing fire, and into the sky.

     Eight Zeros are all over them.

     Earl is in the hut, on the radio and watching through
     binoculars.

                         EARL
               I see six...seven...eight of the
               cocksuckers!  Don't let 'em hurt my
               planes.

     Danny's swiveling in his seat, looking left, right, back.

                         DANNY
               They're all over us!

                         RAFE
               Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.

     Danny understands immediately, following Rafe's tactic as he
     breaks into a sharp turn and uses the hut, palm trees, and
     low hills to shake the Japs.  They fly like crop dusters,
     skimming down a foot from the ground, then bobbing up,
     banking left and right.  The Zeros have divided into two
     groups to chase them, their wings clipping tree tops as they
     try to follow the Americans.

     It feels like a 200 M.P.H. car chase, 20 feet off the ground,
     Rafe and Danny skimming and bobbing over the terrain, but
     there are too many Japanese.

                         RAFE
               Danny!  Let's play some chicken!

     Danny banks in one direction, Rafe in another...

     EXT.  OVER THE LANDING STRIP - DAY

     The two P-40's are screaming, rushing at each other like they
     did at the training base back in the states, flying right
     into each other's propellers; the Japanese heading after them
     realize they're rushing headlong at the other group...

                         EARL
               Oh shit, oh shit...

     He can't even watch.

     At the last instant Rafe and Danny snap a quarter spin so the
     planes flash by belly to belly.

     Two of the Zeros collide in mid-air, exploding, as the other
     Zeros scatter.

     EXT.  SKIES ABOVE PEARL HARBOR - DAY

     Danny and Rafe rejoin each other in the open sky; they've
     lost the Zeros.  The P-40's are flying smoothly, side by
     side.  The two pilots look across at each other, going into
     battle together.  They speak through their radios.

                         RAFE
               You hear my okay?

                         DANNY
               Yeah.  So you can call me if you need
               help.

                         RAFE
               I got a half a tank.  You?

                         DANNY
               Little less.

     He fires a short burst to see if his guns work; they do.
     Rafe does the same.  Up ahead they see a formation of
     Japanese planes, headed toward Pearl.

                         RAFE
               They're in strafing formation, we'll blow
               right through their line.

     They look across at each other.

                         RAFE
               Land of the free.

                         DANNY
               Home of the brave.

     Side by side the P-40's scream in.

     EXT.  ABOVE OAHU - THE DOGFIGHT - DAY

     The Japanese planes are in tight, disciplined formation,
     their minds on the targets below them in the harbor.  But
     their day of shooting sitting ducks changes as the two P-40's
     blast in, wing guns blazing, chopping into Two Zeros.  Both
     Zeros falter and begin to lose altitude.  The P-40's make
     almost impossible tight turns, still side-by-side, and go
     after the two plane they crippled on the first pass.

     Rafe finishes one Zero, making it explode in a ball of flame
     in the air.  Danny finishes the other, shooting off its wing
     so that it spirals into the sea and crashes there.

     The P-40's swoop up again.

                         RAFE
               They're trying to hold formation.  We can
               chew 'em up!

     The P-40's dig in again, swooping down on the line of Zeros.
     Rafe hits first, machine gunning one plane, and Danny comes
     in behind it, finishing it off.

     The Japanese pilots are screaming at each other over their
     radios, but their SQUADRON COMMANDER sees Pearl Harbor ahead,
     and tells them --

                         JAPANESE SQUADRON COMMANDER
               Hold the line!

     The P-40's come through again, their guns spitting fire.

     EXT.  ANOTHER JAPANESE FORMATION OF BOMBERS - DAY

     These planes are different -- high altitude bombers with
     three-man crews, high above the harbor.  The bombardier looks
     through his sight and the bomb bays open.

     THROUGH THE BOMBARDIER'S SIGHT, the ships look like tops, far
     below.  The bombardier is ticking off the targets as they
     pass, the first two he mentions already burning.

                         JAPANESE BOMBARDIER
               West Virginia... Oklahoma... Ah, Arizona.

     He flips his bomb switch, and a HUGE STEEL BOMB falls away.

     EXT.  THE FLIGHT OF THE BOMB - DAY

     We stay with the bomb as it falls through the sky.  The small
     propeller on the bomb's nose spins in the air, running the
     arming mechanism into the bomb's explosive core.  The bomb
     wobbles a bit at first, but then as it gathers speed its fins
     stabilize it, and it falls faster and faster, at a dizzying
     rate, toward the Arizona.

     It slams through the teak wood deck, and breaks it like
     matchsticks.

     It's tremendous weight and speed carry it through the next
     deck, and the next, deep into the heart of the ship...toward
     the powder room, where two million pounds of black powder are
     waiting.

     The bomb hits there, and the explosion is almost beyond
     comprehension.  Over 1400 men die instantly.

     EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

     The battleship Arizona leaps into the air, the ship's spine
     is broken, it's guts ripped open in one explosive instant.
     Men on the deck are thrown into the burning oil already
     floating on the water from the other ruptured ships, but
     there are almost no survivors.

     The concussion of the explosion blows men off the repair ship
     Vestal, next to the Arizona, saving Vestal, as the explosion
     snuffs out the fires on Vestal; it also sends tons of debris
     down on her decks -- parts of the ship, legs, arms and heads
     of men, all sorts of bodies.

     Debris from the Arizona also cover the Tennessee and does
     more damage than the two Japanese bombs that hit her.

     INT.  HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

     Medics have already started bringing in the wounded.  Evelyn
     is like a frantic traffic cop.

                         EVELYN
               Put criticals in ward one, stables in
               two!  Barbara!  Fill every syringe you
               can find with stimulant and antibiotic --

                         MEDIC
               Where are the doctors?

                         EVELYN
               On the third tee.

                         SANDRA
               Evelyn!  Where's the morphine?

     THE FRONT WARD

     Evelyn runs in, snaps open the cabinet, grabs a bag of
     morphine sticks, and is about to run out again when she sees
     the Arizona go up.

     For a moment she's frozen, then she actually sees the shock
     wave traveling across the bay and through the trees like an
     invisible wall.  She's trying to cross her arms over her
     face, and dive to the floor, just as the windows blow out
     from the concussion, and glass flies over everything.

     INT.  JAPANESE BOMBER - DAY

     They see the results of their bomb, and are ecstatic.

     EXT.  AIR ABOVE OAHU - DAY

     The nose of Danny's plane is pointed right at the harbor and
     he sees the sudden devastation of the Arizona.  It is a sight
     so awesome it freezes him for a moment.

     A Zero comes up behind him, firing.  Danny jerks his stick to
     maneuver but he's caught...

     Rafe comes in behind the Zero, chopping it up, even as he
     yells at Danny over the radio --

                         RAFE
               Ain't no time for spectatin'!

     They turn back after the line of Zeros.  There are some
     Japanese planes coming after them now, but the P-40's head at
     their noses, firing, then duck past in a double maneuver, and
     turn right back into the Japanese formation.

     Rafe has a plane in his sights, but his guns fire only a
     short burst before stopping.

                         RAFE
               I'm out of ammo!

                         DANNY
               I'm out of fuel!

     They head back.  A single Zero is on their way.  Rafe charges
     it and draws its fire; Danny comes in behind the Zero and
     rakes its cockpit; the Japanese pilot backs off.

     The P-40's dive back toward Haleiwa.

     A handful of Zeros returning from Pearl see them and follow.

     EXT.  PACIFIC - JAPANESE CARRIERS - DAY

     INT.  WHITE HOUSE - OVAL ROOM - DAY

     President Roosevelt is having lunch in the Oval Room study
     with Harry Hopkins.  The phone RINGS and Hopkins answers.

                         HOPKINS
               Oval Room... Yes, he is.
                    (to Roosevelt)
               It's Knox, Mr. President.

                         ROOSEVELT
                    (taking phone)
               Yes?

     He listens, then puts the receiver down, shaken.

                         ROOSEVELT
               The Japanese have attacked Pearl Harbor.

                         HOPKINS
               My God.  Do we have damage estimates?

                         ROOSEVELT
               Our Pacific Fleet, at anchor, unprepared?
               It's terrible.  It has to be.  And it's
               not over.

     EXT.  HALEIWA - AUXILIARY AIRFIELD - DAY

     The two P-40's drop out of the sky and bounce to a landing;
     Anthony and Red have been pushing the wreckage off the field
     with the Buick.  Danny and Rafe pull the P-40's behind the
     burning quonset hut, and it's like a pit stop at a race
     track; Earl rushes up and starts fueling the planes, their
     engines still running.

                         DANNY
               We need ammo too!

     Earl shouts instructions to the pilots.

                         EARL
               Strip it from the wrecks!

     The other pilots race to the wrecked P-40's and start pulling
     out ammo belts.  Earl glares at the smoking engine of Danny's
     plane, and the bullet holes.

                         EARL
               Who the fuck taught you to fly?

                         DANNY
               He did.

     Earl looks at Rafe's plane, more shot-up and abused than
     Danny's.  Rafe grins and waves to him.  Earl mumbles a stream
     of guttural and unintelligible obscenities.

     The Zeros that followed them sweep down, strafing.  One
     mechanic, running across the field with a belt of ammo, goes
     down.  Coma, running behind him, picks up the fallen man's
     ammo and his own, bringing both to the planes behind the hut.
     He, Red, and Anthony reload the machine guns in Rafe and
     Danny's planes.

     Rafe and Danny gun their engines and head back into the air,
     the grounded pilots firing a covering barrage and Earl even
     coming up with a 12-gauge shotgun to fire at the Zeros as
     they rush past.

     EXT.  SKIES OVER PACIFIC - DAY

     The Second Wave of Japanese planes is in tight formation.

     INT.  LEAD PLANE OF SECOND WAVE - DAY

     Lt. Commander SHIMAZAKI, leader of the second attack wave,
     says calmly into his radio...

                         SHIMAZAKI
               Second wave, deploy over the military
               bases.  High level bombers to the air
               stations, dive bombers attack ships in
               harbor.  Fighters strafe and cover.

     He leads the second wave in on their attack run...

     EXT.  NAVAL AIR STATION - DAY

     The navy's planes, bunched up on the naval airfield, are
     destroyed without ever getting into the air.

     EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

     The harbor is already a mass of destruction and panic;
     screaming everywhere, men trying to fight fires, move the
     wounded; the second wave of planes hits, and tremendous
     explosions now rock the secondary ships like the destroyer
     SHAW, blasting it apart.

     But the Japanese pilots are now having trouble with the thick
     black smoke coming out of the damaged ships, and off the oil
     fires along the water.  One torpedo plane, its pilot flying
     blind, clips the superstructure of a battleship and spins to
     a crash.

     Still, even IN THE CHAOS ON THE SHIPS, the sailors struggle
     to survive, inventively.  Men trapped on one burning ship use
     the severed barrel of a five-inch naval gun as a bridge to
     cross to the less damaged ship anchored beside them.

     Others jump into the water and swim through the burning oil,
     towing buddies too wounded to swim themselves.

     EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

     Below decks, sailors have organized a line and are passing
     ammunition from the ammo lockers, hand to hand up to the guns
     on deck.  Blasts from bombs hit them and ignite the ammo
     they're holding, setting off a chain reaction of explosions.

     On the deck, the sailors are out of ammo.  An OFFICER grabs a
     SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD SAILOR.

                         OFFICER
               Grab a dinghy and get ammo from the base
               ammo storeroom.

     The young sailor jumps to a dinghy and launches it through
     the oily waters and thick black smoke.

     EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

     The sailors in the boat get strafed, the rounds cutting
     between them and blasting their boat in two.  They jump into
     the oily water and swim toward shore.

     Other sailors are in the water with them, struggling,
     swallowing the vile black liquid as they battle to swim.
     Errant bombs and shrapnel hit beside them, killing some;
     other lose strength and slide beneath the surface.

     The sailors from the ammo boat make it ashore; it's hot there
     too, with bullets and bombs all around.  One sailor has to
     stop and puke from the oil; his buddy grabs him and they run
     for cover; they find it in the dugout of the baseball
     diamond.

     EXT.  NAVAL STATION - DAY

     A MARINE GUNNERY SERGEANT leads men in a race through
     strafing fire to the bases ammo storeroom.

     INT.  AMMO STOREROOM - DAY

     The SUPPLY SERGEANT is at his post.

                         GUNNERY SERGEANT
               We need weapons and ammo!

                         SUPPLY SERGEANT
               You need authorization.

                         GUNNERY SERGEANT
               The fuck I do!

     He pushes the man out of the way and starts grabbing weapons.

     EXT.  NAVAL STATION - DAY

     The gunnery sergeant and his marines run with a water-cooled
     machine gun, across the open ground, under fire.

     BARRACKS

     The Marines set up in the windows of their already-strafed
     barracks, and start firing there, as the Zeros scream past.

     EXT.  NAVAL STATION - DAY

     Trucks are moving dependents -- women and children -- from
     the dependents' housing area.  The Japanese strafe the
     trucks, dependents diving for cover.

     NAVAL STATION

     A fire engine from the Honolulu Fire Department races up to
     the sight of buildings burning from the air attack.  As the
     firemen jump out, a Zero strafes them, gunning down the
     firemen.

     As the strafing Zero starts to bank away, two P-40's come in
     behind it, both of them gunning away.  The Zero comes apart
     under the barrage, and crashes in a ball of flame.

     It's Rafe and Danny, back in the air.

     INT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - DAY

     The once-pristine hospital with its glowing white beds is now
     a bloody chaos.  Every bed is already full; there are burned
     and broken people on the floor -- soldiers, sailors,
     civilians, firemen, all mixed in together.  People are dying
     everywhere, and screaming in pain, or moaning and begging for
     help.  At first we don't see Evelyn, and wonder if she
     survived the glass; then we see her, flecks of her own blood
     dotting her face and arms.  The blood of soldiers on her
     surgical apron.  A steel calm has replaced her earlier
     frenzy, even as the other nurses are breaking down.

                         SANDRA
               I can't tell who's gotten morphine and
               who hasn't!

                         EVELYN
               Take a grease pencil and mark an M on the
               forehead of everyone you stick.

     A young doctor is trying to give an intravenous injection to
     a man who's badly charred; the doctors hands are shaking.

                         EVELYN
               Don't look for a vein, just poke.

                         SANDRA
               My pen's dry!

                         EVELYN
               Use lipstick.  Use ammo belts for
               tourniquets, use your own nylons if you
               have to!  Barbara!  Grab anything that
               will hold a pint of blood and sterilize
               it.

     The doctors are amputating limbs right there in the hallway.
     A SENIOR DOCTOR calls --

                         SENIOR DOCTOR
               Evelyn!  You have to do the triage!
               They're bringing them in with trucks!

     Evelyn moves to the door.  Trucks are pulling up, loaded with
     the wounded, young terrified soldiers bringing them inside;
     Evelyn does quick triage as they pass.

                         EVELYN
               Critical -- front ward!... Give him
               morphine, he can't wait...

     The next body through is a pilot, wings on his uniform, his
     chest riddled with bullets -- and his face shot off.  For a
     moment Evelyn falters, then she forces herself to check the
     dog tags...

     It isn't Rafe or Danny.  Evelyn sags in guilty relief.

                         EVELYN
               Take him outside and cover him; he's
               dead.

     She steadies herself as the next body comes through, a woman
     on a stretcher, her stomach shot open, pale hands clutching
     at the open wound.  Evelyn feels for a pulse.

                         EVELYN
               She's gone too, take her --

     It's Betty.

     And though the bombs are blasting and guns booming
     everywhere, the world goes silent for Evelyn.

     One of the sailors outside the door is pointing to the
     harbor, the Nevada has begun to move.

     EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

     The battleship NEVADA is underway, plowing through the
     harbor, as the water erupts with bombs.

     INT.  THE NEVADA'S BRIDGE - DAY

     The Captain is struggling to save his ship.

                         CAPTAIN OF THE NEVADA
               We can save her if we make the open sea!

     EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - POV THE ATTACKING PLANES - DAY

     The lead pilot in the next squad of Japanese planes spots the
     moving battleship, and leads his squadron on it.

     They come whipping in over the waves, dropping torpedoes and
     bombs.

     INT.  THE NEVADA'S BRIDGE - DAY

     The Nevada's Captain feels the ship shudder as it takes hits
     amidships.

                         CAPTAIN OF THE NEVADA
               We're not gonna make it -- and if we go
               down here we block the channel... Beach
               her, there!

     His officers relay the order to the helm, and the ship's
     rudder turns as more blasts rip her hull.

     EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

     The Nevada swings off its course and runs aground.

     INT.  THE NEVADA'S DYNAMO ROOM - DAY

     The impact jolts the boilers, already bursting with the steam
     pressure; gouts of steam from rupturing pipes scalds and
     blinds the engine room crew.

     EXT.  THE NEVADA - DAY

     The Nevada, run aground at the shoreline, is now like a beast
     cut from the herd; the predators swarm after it with
     torpedoes and bombs.

     One torpedo, missing the Nevada, skims right up the beach
     itself and blasts a house on the shore to fragments.

     Bombs detonate along the Nevada, engulfing the entire upper
     deck in flames, ravaging the sailors.

     EXT.  HOSPITAL - DAY

     The Nevada is grounded near the hospital; from the doorway
     Evelyn can see the whole ship on fire, burning sailors
     leaping off the decks.  Her hearing, her presence of mind,
     returns; she lets Betty go, and grabs an ORDERLY.

                         EVELYN
               Go to the base hardware store and get
               some of those canister spray things they
               use for killing bugs.

                         ORDERLY
               Insecticide?...

                         EVELYN
               No, just the sprayers.  We'll fill them
               with tannic acid, it'll sterilize them
               and cool the burns!  GO!

     The orderly races away.  They can still hear the bombs
     falling outside.

     A sailor staggers toward the hospital from the Nevada.  He is
     completely gray.  Everyone stares at him, and then realizes
     he is nude, burned gray, his skin ash.

     Evelyn rushes to help him, shouting back over her shoulder to
     the other nurses --

                         EVELYN
               We're gonna need every bed.  If they can
               breathe, make 'em get up and move
               someplace else!

     EXT.  JAPANESE CARRIER - FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     The first wave of planes lands on the carrier.  The flight
     leader rushes to the bridge.

     INT.  JAPANESE CARRIER - BRIDGE - DAY

     Yamamoto's advisors are exultant.

                         GENDA
               We have achieved complete surprise!  The
               first wave is returning, the second is
               attacking now, and we have lost only a
               few planes.  We can launch a third wave,
               Admiral.

                         YAMAMOTO
               The second wave has not returned.  And we
               have no idea where their carriers are.
               What is the damage report?

                         COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
               We have Commander Fuchida on the radio
               now, Admiral.

     Yamamoto nods and Fuchida's voice comes over the intercom.

                         FUCHIDA'S VOICE
               I am over the harbor now...

     EXT.  SKIES ABOVE PEARL HARBOR - DAY

     Fuchida is in a scout plane, high over Pearl.  His vision is
     hampered by the thick black smoke, but he can tell there has
     been awesome devastation.  He uses a diagram of the ships at
     anchor to note the damage to each ship.

                         FUCHIDA
                    (into radio)
               We have a tremendous victory.  Many ships
               damaged, some totally destroyed.  But the
               Second Wave's attack is being hindered by
               the smoke.

     EXT.  JAPANESE CARRIER AKAGI - DAY

     The last planes touch down, and the lead carrier and the
     other ships in the Japanese assault fleet turn back toward
     home.

     EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - AFTERMATH - DAY

     The harbor is a place of shattered bodies and shattered
     ships.  Blood, body parts, debris everywhere, and all of it
     made more hellish by the oil fires on the water and the
     choking black smoke those fires produce.

     Every survivor has become an emergency fireman, stretcher
     bearer, medic, iron worker.  They fish men from the water,
     extract them from the tangled wreckage of the ships.
     Everyone is screaming and yelling -- the wounded for help,
     the helpers for more help.

     Local firemen and civilians battle heroically too; the water
     mains are ruptured, so they put pump water from the base
     swimming pool toward the burning ships.

     The PHOTOGRAPHER records this with his black-and-white film
     camera.  He is shaken, and yet he understands the magnitude
     of what he is recording -- the loss of America's innocence.

     EXT.  ARMY BASE - AFTERMATH - DAY

     In one place, outside a barracks, soldiers hit by the bombs
     are just becoming conscious.  One of them comes to.

                         CONSCIOUS SOLDIER
               Sarge?!  Where are you, Sarge?

     He's crawling around toward the bushes; his legs are
     shattered, but he's spotted a body.  He reaches it, turns it
     over -- and it's headless.

     He turns away in horror...and finds himself staring at the
     severed head.

     The medics appear.

                         MEDIC
               We've got two more over here!

     An aide hands Short the telegram.  He reads it --

                         SHORT
               From Washington.  "Intelligence reports

     EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - AFTERMATH - DAY

     Divers are going down, trying to save the trapped men.  But
     the tangle of the Arizona is horrific.  One diver gets
     trapped, and another tries to extricate him, and the steel
     shifts and falls on them both.

     ON THE DECK OF BOMB-SHATTERED BATTLESHIP, a naval CAPTAIN
     oversees rescue efforts.  The 17-year-old sailor he sent off
     for ammo now approaches him, with great concern.

                         SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD SAILOR
               Sir, I...I lost the dinghy.

     The captain looks out over the wreckage, great battleships
     devastated in every direction.

                         CAPTAIN
               Well, son, we won't worry about the
               dinghy today.

     EXT.  HOSPITAL - PEARL HARBOR - NIGHT

     Danny and Rafe arrive at the hospital.  Their fears of what
     they might find aren't helped when they see the stairs into
     the hospital covered in blood.

     INT.  HOSPITAL - PEARL HARBOR - NIGHT

     Rafe and Danny enter.  It's a scene from hell.  Doctors are
     doing amputations in the hallway.  The once-pristine hospital
     is now all red, with blood dripping through the mattresses,
     onto the floor...

     In the main ward, Evelyn and the other nurses are using the
     fly sprayers to spritz cooling antiseptic on the charred
     bodies.  Evelyn looks up and sees both Rafe and Danny.  Her
     eyes register relief, but they are the only part of her that
     can show emotion now; the rest of her is covered in blood.
     Rafe and Danny move to her.

                         RAFE
               How can we help?

     INT.  HOSPITAL - PEARL HARBOR - NIGHT

     Rafe and Danny sit quietly as Evelyn adjusts the tubes
     conducting blood from their arms into sterilized Coke bottles
     for transfusion.

                         RAFE
               What else can we do?

                         EVELYN
               There's nothing you can do here, they'll
               die or they won't, we just --

     She stops, afraid if she says more, she'll lose grip on her
     emotions.  She can see the wreckage out in the harbor.

                         EVELYN
               There was a sailor, a black man on the
               West Virginia, named Dorie Miller.  I'd
               like to know if he's alive.

     She goes back to her work.

     EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

     Rafe and Danny hop from the ambulance in which they've
     hitched a ride to the harbor.  They see the awful
     devastation.

     EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - NIGHT

     Rafe and Danny reach the West Virginia's pier, but in the
     darkness, they can't find anything.  They stop a NAVAL
     OFFICER.

                         DANNY
               Where is the West Virginia?

                         OFFICER
               There.

     He points; the battleship has sunk, its superstructure barely
     showing above the water.

     It looks hopeless to find a single sailor here; but then they
     see a powerful black sailor, pulling to the dock with a
     dinghy full of dead men retrieved from the water.  As workers
     unload the bodies, the black sailor sits down, exhausted
     physically and emotionally, his head in his hands.  Rafe and
     Danny approach him.

                         DANNY
               We're looking for Dorie Miller.

                         DORIE
               That's me, Sir.

                         RAFE
               A friend of ours wanted to be sure you're
               alive.  Evelyn.  A nurse.

                         DORIE
               How is she?

                         DANNY
               Like we all are.

     Miller nods, and looks out over the harbor, a hellish place
     where black smoke still hangs over everything, the shattered
     remains of men and ships still in the harbor.  It's total
     devastation.  And yet something about that scene stirs
     something else in Dorie Miller.

                         DORIE
               There's something out there I need to
               get.  Will you help me?

     EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - AFTERMATH - NIGHT

     Dorie pilots the dinghy through the floating debris.  Rafe
     and Danny sit with him.  He stops over a dangerous pile of
     superstructure wreckage.

                         DORIE
               The Arizona.  Hold the dinghy steady, so
               it doesn't bust open.

     Rafe and Danny brace the dinghy so it doesn't move; but they
     still don't see what Dorie is after as he fishes down in the
     water, for something barely at the surface; he works for a
     moment, then pulls it up.

     It's the oil-soaked flag of the Arizona.

     EXT.  HULL OF OKLAHOMA - NIGHT

     Men are working through the night to save the sailors trapped
     in the hull.

     INT.  OKLAHOMA - THE TRAPPED SAILORS

     are in total darkness.  From it we hear GASPING, then --

                         SAILOR
               What's that?

     The light comes on and sweeps around the faces.  The water is
     up to their chests, but it's stopped rising.

                         SAILOR FLASHLIGHT
               Just hand on.  They'll find us.

                         SAILOR
               How do you know?

                         SAILOR FLASHLIGHT
               Because we would find them.

     He switches the light off again.

     EXT.  HULL OF OKLAHOMA - NIGHT

     The welders are cutting away, the torches sending showers of
     sparks everywhere.

     INT.  OKLAHOMA - THE TRAPPED SAILORS

     They are gasping, running out of air.

                         SAILOR FLASHLIGHT
               Breathe easy.  Stay calm.

                         SAILOR
               You hear something?

     Something stirs in the ship; a noise...from where?  Then a
     point of light; sparks fly into the room; somebody's cutting
     through the wall.  And the sparks illuminate faces suddenly
     filled with hope.

     But as the cut enlarges, the trapped air, compressed by the
     water, starts rushing out -- and the water starts rising
     again.  The trapped sailors hope turns to terror.

                         SAILOR
               It's letting out air, and letting in
               water!

     The steel circle pops out, and they knock the welders down in
     their hurry to escape.

     Some of the sailors who were trapped are naked.  They fight
     their way toward the escape hole cut into the hull, assisted
     by rescue workers.

     EXT.  HULL OF OKLAHOMA - NIGHT

     The trapped sailors emerge, and they can barely take in the
     devastation.  Destroyed ships everywhere, the smoking
     wreckage... The rescued sailors gaze around them in shock.
     They are shivering, and other sailors put blankets around
     them.

     EXT.  WHITE HOUSE - DAY

     The entire Washington press corps is waiting, with fresh
     bulbs in the flash attachments of cameras that are already as
     big as a shoe box.  The President is wheeled out of the White
     House, and not a single photographer takes a picture...not
     yet.

     Aides help Roosevelt from the chair, and the press people all
     see the President struggle on legs that have no strength, to
     the podium.  His aides lock the steel clasps at the knees of
     his braces into place, and the President stands at the
     microphone.  And suddenly, from the front, Roosevelt looks
     powerful, even majestic.

     Now all the bulbs pop and flash.  He looks into the cameras.

                         ROOSEVELT
               Yesterday, December 7, 1941 -- a date
               which will live in infamy -- the United
               States of American was suddenly and
               deliberately attacked by naval and air
               forces of the Empire of Japan.

     OVER THIS, we see the bombing, the aftermath, the bodies
     being fished from the oil-soaked harbor.

                         ROOSEVELT
               The distance of Hawaii from Japan makes
               it obvious that the attacks was planned
               many days or even weeks ago.  During the
               intervening time the Japanese Government
               has deliberately sought to deceive the
               United States by false statements and
               expressions of hope for continued peace.

     EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

     The Japanese fleet steams back toward Japan.  The young
     officers are exultant...but Yamamoto is pensive.

                         ROOSEVELT
               ...I regret to tell you that many
               American lives have been lost.

     EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

     We see rows of bodies outside the hospital where Evelyn
     works.

     The mess hall has been converted to a silent morgue, with
     bodies on every table.

                         ROOSEVELT
               Yesterday the Japanese Government also
               launched an attack against Malaya.  Last
               night Japanese forces attacked Hong
               Kong... Guam...

     OVER THIS, EXT.  ISLANDS - NIGHT

     We see Japanese planes bombing islands, and soldiers
     attacking amphibious landings.

                         ROOSEVELT
               ...the Philippine Islands... Wake
               Island... And this morning the Japanese
               attacked Midway Island.

     EXT.  WHITE HOUSE - DAY

                         ROOSEVELT
               The facts speak for themselves.  With
               confidence in our armed forces -- with
               the unbounding determination of our
               people -- we will gain the inevitable
               triumph -- so help us God.  I ask that
               the Congress declare that since the
               unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan
               on Sunday, December 7, 1941, a state of
               war --

     The words echoes out across America --

                         ROOSEVELT'S VOICE
               War...war...war...

     It rings through the radios of farm houses, to country boys
     gathered round; in the pool halls of big cities; in the fire
     houses and high schools...

     THE LINES AT RECRUITING STATIONS all across America -- men
     line up faster than the recruiters can handle them.

     INT.  WHITE HOUSE - DAY

     Roosevelt meets with his advisors.

                         ROOSEVELT
               Gentlemen, the crisis we face is not the
               fact that our enemies believe they can
               defeat us -- it's the fact that our people
               believe it too.  I want a plan -- a
               workable plan -- to hit the heart of
               Japan, to bomb them the way they have
               bombed us.

                         ADMIRAL
               Mr. President, Pearl Harbor caught us
               because we didn't face facts.  This isn't
               a time for ignoring them again.  There
               are no planes in the entire American
               arsenal capable of covering the distance
               to Japan from any land base we control
               while carrying enough bombs to do any
               damage whatsoever.

                         GENERAL MARSHALL
               He's right, Mr. President.  The Army has
               long range bombers, but no place to
               launch them from.  Midway's too far,
               China is overrun by Japanese forces, and
               Russia refuses to go to war with Japan
               and won't allow us to launch a raid from
               there.

                         ADMIRAL
               The navy's planes are small, carry light
               loads, and have short range.  We would
               have to get them within a few hundred
               miles of Japan, and therefore risk our
               carriers.  And if we lose our carriers,
               we have no shield against invasion.

                         ROOSEVELT
               What if the Japanese did invade?

                         GENERAL MARSHALL
               We've done studies.  We're confident we
               would turn them back eventually...after
               they'd gotten as far as Chicago.

                         ADMIRAL
               Mr. President...with all respect...what
               you are asking can't be done.

     Roosevelt places his hands on the arms of his wheelchair, and
     struggles to lift himself.  Aides jump to help him, but he
     waves them off.  With inhuman physical effort, that has his
     neck veins bulging and sweat popping on his face, Roosevelt
     stands on his withered legs.

                         ROOSEVELT
               Do not tell me...it can't be done.

     EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - HICKAM BASE - DAY

     There is a mass memorial service going on, with caskets
     draped in flags.

     There are also coffins covered in Japanese flags, their
     drowned fliers being treated now with respect.

     Everyone is in their best uniforms.  The pilots -- Rafe,
     Danny, and the other guys -- are looking at Billy's coffin;
     Evelyn, next to Danny, on his appropriate side is looking at
     one that belongs to Betty.  So is Red; he's grieving.

                         MINISTER
               ...Where is God in this?  Our enemies
               believe a divine wind protects them.  We
               see our friends laid out before us, and
               find it hard to believe in anything at
               all.

     Rafe and Evelyn exchange a glance, past Danny.

                         MINISTER
               Though we cannot understand why our
               friends should die while we live, we can
               affirm our truest selves in our belief
               that any God worth divinity would choose
               both justice and mercy, and would take
               these fallen brothers and sisters into
               eternal peace.  Amen.

     As the mourners disperse, Evelyn puts a lei on Betty's
     casket; Red does the same, then breaks down beside Danny.  As
     Danny comforts him, Evelyn moves to Rafe.

                         EVELYN
               Rafe --

                         RAFE
               I need to tell you something.  I didn't
               know what it was to lose somebody, to see
               death and find how much it scares you.
               That you haven't lived and loved enough.
               I didn't understand.  Forgive me.

                         EVELYN
               Rafe... No.  You forgive me.

                         RAFE
               Of course I forgive you.  I know what you
               feel for Danny is real.  And your choice
               is your choice.

                         EVELYN
               That's what I have to tell you, Rafe.  It
               wasn't a choice.  It --

     An Army Corps MAJOR steps up and interrupts.

                         MAJOR
               Lieutenant Rafe McCawley?

                         RAFE
               Yes, Major.

                         MAJOR
               Lieutenant Daniel Walker here too?

     Danny sees him and moves up.

                         DANNY
               I'm Walker.

                         MAJOR
               You're going Stateside.  We fly out in
               half an hour.

     He hands them both orders.

                         RAFE
               What for, Sir?

                         MAJOR
               Ask Colonel Doolittle.  Those orders are
               from him.

     EXT.  HICKAM FIELD - DAY

     The wrecked planes have been pushed off the runway and lie in
     piles.  A transport plane is fueling, and Rafe and Danny wait
     in the shade of a shelter.

                         DANNY
               I told her not to come.

     The Major, watching the fueling, gets a wave from the ground
     crew and turns and motions to Rafe and Danny that they're
     ready.  They pick up their duffel bags -- and then Evelyn
     comes around the corner of the shelter.

     Rafe sees her first, but stops and looks away as Danny moves
     to her.  For a moment he studies her eyes, and she does not
     look away.

                         DANNY
               This hasn't been easy for any of us.  I
               feel awful for how it's happened.  But
               I've seen my first spring too.  Thanks
               for knowing that's true.

     He takes her into his arms, kisses her tenderly but briefly,
     a final time.  Evelyn's eyes find Rafe, but he can't look at
     her until the embrace is over.

     Rafe and Danny move to the plane and hurry up the steps.
     They turn before the door closes and wave to her.

     Evelyn's still standing there as the plane lifts away.

     INT.  U.S. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT

     The transport has landed and taxied right to the door of a
     low, dark bunker, mostly underground.  The Major leads Rafe
     and Danny inside.

     INT.  BUNKER

     Rafe and Danny follow the Major down a spartan corridor; the
     whole place reeks of secrecy.

     INT.  BUNKER - SECRECY ROOM - NIGHT

     The Major opens the door for Rafe and Danny, then leaves,
     closing it behind him.  Doolittle is alone at a desk.  Rafe
     and Danny walk in and salute.  Doolittle motions to the two
     chairs in front of the desk without looking up from the
     papers he's studying.

                         DOOLITTLE
               I heard what you did.

                         RAFE
               We can explain, Colonel.

                         DOOLITTLE
               Explain what?

                         DANNY
               Whatever is was you heard about us.

                         DOOLITTLE
               You mean the hula shirts you were flying
               in?... Or the six planes you shot down?
               You're both being awarded the Silver
               Star, and promoted to captain.

                         RAFE
               Is that the good new, Sir, or --

                         DOOLITTLE
               You're just about the only pilots in the
               Army with actual combat experience, so
               you're volunteering for a mission I've
               been ordered to put together.  Do you
               know what top secret is?

                         RAFE
               Well sure, Colonel --

                         DOOLITTLE
               Top secret means you help me pick the
               other pilots, train, and go -- without
               knowing where you're going until it's too
               late.

                         DANNY
               You can count on us.

                         DOOLITTLE
               There's only one other thing I can tell
               you.

     Doolittle looks up from his paperwork for the first time.
     His eyes are fierce.

                         DOOLITTLE
               You won't need any goddamn hula shirts.

     EXT.  ESTABLISHING EGLIN FIELD, FLORIDA - DAY

     Eglin Field is on the gulf coast of Florida.

     INT.  BRIEFING ROOM - EGLIN FIELD - DAY

     A room full of PILOTS are assembled, with and other CREWMEN.
     Danny and Rafe are there; Red and Anthony too.

                         VOICE
               Attention!

     Colonel Doolittle strides into the room as all the men snap
     to attention.

                         DOOLITTLE
               Be seated.  The mission you've
               volunteered for is dangerous.  How
               dangerous?  Look at the man beside you.
               It's a good bet that six weeks from now,
               either you or he will be dead.

     Danny and Rafe whisper to each other --

                         DANNY
               Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna
               make it.

                         RAFE
               What color flowers you want me to bring
               to your funeral?

                         DOOLITTLE
               In flight school you qualified in single
               and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be
               flying multi-engines here.

                         RAFE
                    (whispering)
               Bombers.

                         DOOLITTLE
               I want to introduce a couple of people.
               Doc White is a flight surgeon; he has
               volunteered for gunnery training so that
               he can go on the mission, because we
               can't spare the weight of an extra man.

                         DANNY
                    (whispering)
               A long range bomber mission.

                         DOOLITTLE
               ...And Ross Greening, who will oversee
               your equipment.  Any questions?

                         DANNY
               Who'll be the first one in, Colonel?  I'd
               like to volunt --

     Rafe elbows his ribs so hard it takes his breath away.

                         DOOLITTLE
               I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not
               just putting this mission together -- I'm
               leading it myself.

                         RAFE
               I take it back, about the flowers.  We're
               all gonna die.

     EXT.  EGLIN FIELD - RUNWAY - DAY

     CLOSE - A B-25 bomber, from different angles.

     The pilots look them over, liking what they see.

                         DOOLITTLE
               This is what we'll fly -- the B-25.
               There's one thing you have to be aware of
               from the very beginning.  You see that
               private?

     They look down the runway a few hundred feet.  A private
     waves, and starts painting a red line across the runway.
     Another private, close by, paints a green line.

                         DOOLITTLE
               Green means go.  Red means dead.

     MONTAGE - THE TRAINING - EGLIN FIELD - DAY

     The pilots practice takeoff's.  Red is Rafe's copilot;
     Anthony is Danny's.  Nobody can get airborne before the red
     line.

     INT.  EGLIN FIELD - LECTURE ROOM - DAY

     Doolittle is instructing the men.

                         DOOLITTLE
               You're having trouble getting airborne in
               the shorter space because you're not
               revving the engines enough.  You've got
               to push them to the limit before you ever
               start to move.

     Rafe is distracted; he's lost in though, looking at Danny --
     and looks away just before Danny realizes it.

     MONTAGE CONTINUES - EXT.  EGLIN FIELD RUNWAY - DAY

     Pilots practice hard, revving the engines, taking off
     hard...all of them crossing the red line, takeoff after
     takeoff.  Rafe pushes his engine hard and still crosses by
     twenty feet; Danny pushes even harder, and misses by ten
     feet.

     Doolittle watches with Greening from the edge of the runway.

                         DOOLITTLE
               We've got to get the weight down.

     INT.  HANGER - EGLIN FIELD - DAY

     Greening has removed the intensely complex Norden sight from
     a bomber and put in on a table for Doolittle.

                         GREENING
               Okay, forty pounds gone.  And in it's
               place, this.

     He shows Doolittle an aluminum strip on a swivel.

                         GREENING
               Weight, 3 ounces.  Cost, 20 cents.

                         DOOLITTLE
               Does it work?

     EXT.  EGLIN FIELD - DAY

     Doolittle pilots a B-25 at treetop level onto a practice
     bombing range.  Greening uses the makeshift sight, and drops
     a 500-lb sack of flour, right in the middle of the bull's-eye
     target chalked on the ground.

     EXT.  FLORIDA COAST - DAY

     The B-25's are practicing, flying at treetop level.  Red is
     Rafe's copilot, Anthony is Danny's.  Doolittle is flying the
     lead bomber.

                         DOOLITTLE
               Right down to the treetops.  Low as you
               can.

     Rafe brings his plane down, smoothly.  Then Danny's plane
     appears -- under him.  Rafe jerks his nose up quickly.
     Rafe's angry; Danny's laughing -- but he scares the shit out
     of his crew.

     EXT.  EGLIN FIELD - NIGHT

     Danny's outside, looking up at the moon.  Rafe appears and
     moves up beside him.

                         DANNY
               Fun today.  Like old times.

                         RAFE
               Danny, what the hell are you trying to do
               out there?

                         DANNY
               What do you mean?  I'm just doing what
               we've always done.

                         RAFE
               No.  You're trying to beat me.

                         DANNY
               We've always tried to beat each other.

                         RAFE
               Bullshit.  We've played with each other,
               pushed each other.  This is different.
               Like you want to prove that you're
               better than me.  Who's that for --
               Evelyn?

     Danny's anger flares for a moment -- but Rafe's hit home.

                         DANNY
               Maybe just trying to measure up.

                         RAFE
               What's between you and her is between you
               and her.  But here's what's between you
               and me.  Everybody has a hero, Danny.
               And you're mine.

     Danny's caught off-guard.

                         RAFE
               When we were growing up, I had
               everything.  You had nothing.  You
               climbed out of a hole I couldn't even see
               the bottom of.  I think maybe when I went
               off to England, I was trying to measure
               up to you.  Measuring up's over.  Let's
               just look out for each other.  Okay?

     They embrace, closer now than ever.

     MONTAGE - INTERCUT

     with the planes practicing their short takeoffs, we see
     Roosevelt in one of his fireside chats, his voice broadcast
     across America...

                         ROOSEVELT'S VOICE
               Good evening, America...

     Families all across America are gathered around radios,
     listening.

                         ROOSEVELT'S VOICE
               I'm told that 80% of American families
               are listening to these fireside chats of
               ours, and I'm happy we can come together,
               as one great American family.  I'd like
               each of you within the sound of my voice
               to find a map...

     The FAMILIES do, gathering around encyclopedias, school
     books, any reference they have, spread on kitchen tables,
     suburban living room rugs, or farmhouse hearths...

     And the B-25's, all sixteen of them, begin a journey in
     formation, flying at treetop level across America:
     Mississippi delta land, Texas plains, Arizona mesas...

                         ROOSEVELT'S VOICE
               Look at the Pacific Ocean.  It covers
               half the surface of the earth.  And look
               at the great Atlantic.  The oceans both
               divide and connect us to our enemies, and
               either they will come to us, or we will
               go to them...

     The formation of B-25's reaches San Francisco.

     EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO NAVAL AIR STATION - DAY

     Doolittle leads the bombers to a landing.  IN RAFE'S PLANE,
     everybody's wondering why they're here.

                         RED
               N-naval station?  What's g-going on?

                         RAFE
               Wish I knew, Red.

     EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO AIR FIELD - DAY

     The crews climb from their planes, and almost before they're
     out, teams of men use straps and cranes to hoist the bombers
     onto flatbed trucks.  Doolittle walks up to Rafe and Danny,
     watching the baffling operation.

                         DOOLITTLE
               Want to see where they're going?

     EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO HARBOR - EVENING

     Cranes lift the planes from the trucks and hoist them onto
     the flight decks of the carrier USS HORNET.  The pilots stand
     on the pier, watching.

                         ANTHONY
               I guess that settles it.  Somewhere in
               the Pacific.

                         RED
               With a s-short r-runway.

     They all gather around Doolittle as he moves up to them.

                         DOOLITTLE
               You have rooms at the Biltmore.  I
               suggest a nice meal and a good night's
               sleep.  We leave tomorrow.

     Doolittle walks to join a captain.

     INT./ EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL - NIGHT

     The pilots get off the bus and carry their duffels into the
     lobby.

                         ANTHONY
               San Francisco, here we are!

                         DANNY
                    (grinning)
               I don't reckon we can get hogbrains and
               grits, but I hear a man can eat good in
               this town.

                         RAFE
               I'm gonna turn in.  I hate being on the
               water.  I think this is the last sleep
               I'll get for awhile.

     INT.  LOBBY - NIGHT

     The other guys drop their duffels with the bell hops; Rafe
     moves to the reception desk.

                         RAFE
               McCawley.

     The manager hands him a key, and smiles curiously.

                         MANAGER
               Have fun.

     INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     Rafe enters his room and finds the light on...and Evelyn's
     there waiting.

                         RAFE
               What?...

                         EVELYN
               They were bringing back a ship full of
               wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I
               wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I
               needed to see you before you go.

                         RAFE
               It must of been a convincing letter.

                         EVELYN
               It was.  I couldn't have you go away,
               wherever it is...to war...without knowing
               something.  You think I made a choice, of
               Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have
               a choice.  I'm pregnant.

     The blood drains from Rafe's heart.  Yet he finds the
     strength to move to her.  She turns away, so she won't throw
     her arms around him.

                         RAFE
               Does Danny know?

     She shakes her head, refuses to cry.

                         EVELYN
               I wasn't sure, until the day you turned
               up alive.  I never had a chance to tell
               him.  Now I can't have him thinking about
               this when he needs to be thinking about
               his mission, and how to come back from
               it.

     She turns and faces him again.

                         EVELYN
               I want you thinking about that too.  Just
               come back.
                    (beat)
               Rafe, I see it in your face.  You're
               thinking you don't have anything to live
               for.  Don't you dare think that way.
               I'll never write a letter, or look at a
               sunset, without thinking of you.  I'll
               love you my whole life.  And I want you
               to live.

     She looks at him, her eyes bright with tears, but still she
     refuses to cry.  They both know they can't touch, or they'll
     never let go.  She walks past him, out of the room, closing
     the door softly behind her.

     EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO HARBOR - DAY

     The USS HORNET clears the Golden Gate Bridge, with cruisers
     and destroyers rounding out its battle group.

     Rafe and Danny stand on the flight deck, watching the city
     recede behind them.

     Evelyn is on a hilltop watching them go.  Danny can't see
     her, doesn't know she's there.  Rafe can't see her either --
     but he knows.

                         SHIP'S INTERCOM
               Army pilots to the briefing room.

     INT.  THE CARRIER HORNET - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

     The pilots are gathered expectantly in the carrier's
     conference room.  Doolittle strides in.

                         DOOLITTLE
               Gentlemen, I can now tell you that the
               target of this mission is Tokyo.

     The pilots love it.  The ones who have not seen battle are
     grinning and vocal.  Rafe, Danny, Anthony, and Red are
     quieter, savoring the prospect of revenge.

                         RED
               And where's the secret base, Sir?  The
               one we t-takeoff from.

                         DOOLITTLE
               The navy will get us to within 400 miles
               of the Japanese coast.  We'll launch off
               the carriers from there.

     Suddenly the pilots don't like the sound of this.

                         ANTHONY
               Sir, has this ever been done, launching
               an army bomber off a navy carrier?

                         DOOLITTLE
               No.  Any other questions?

                         RED
               C-Colonel, we been p-practicing
               takeoff's, but I ain't sure we can land
               on these carriers d-decks.

                         DOOLITTLE
               We won't have the fuel to get back to the
               carriers; they'll turn and run back to
               Hawaii the minute we're airborne.

                         RED
               Then wh-where do we land?

                         DOOLITTLE
               I have a phrase I want you all to
               memorize:  "Lushu hoo megwa fugi."  It
               means "I am an American."  In Chinese.

     Absolute silence among the pilots.

     EXT.  FLIGHT DECK OF THE HORNET - DAY

     The sailors who man the flight deck look at each other with
     bafflement as the worried pilots pace from one end of the
     deck to the other.  They're in a line like ducks, Rafe in the
     lead and the others following, counting steps, each man
     measuring the distance.  Shaking their heads, worrying.

     They stop at the end and look down at the sea far below them;
     it's dizzying.  Anthony shoves Red for fun before grabbing
     his shoulder to stop him from falling.

                         RED
               A-a-asshole!... Maybe it's l-longer
               going this way.

     He starts pacing back the other way, as if the ship's longer
     in that direction.  The other pilots watch him for a moment,
     then follow him, counting again.

     Rafe and Danny are left standing alone at the end of the
     flight deck.  Far over the surging sea.

                         DANNY
               It's shorter than our practice runway.

                         RAFE
               They'll turn the ship into the wind
               before we launch.  That'll help.

                         DANNY
               We'll be loaded with 2,000 pounds of
               bombs and 1,500 pounds of fuel.  I got
               another Chinese phrase for Doolittle.
               "Mug wump rickshaw mushu pork."  It
               means "Who the fuck thought up this
               shit?"

     Doolittle appears right beside them.

                         DOOLITTLE
               He was a navy man.

     Doolittle walks away.

                         RAFE
               Maybe we'll be lucky with the weather.

                                        SMASH TO:

     EXT.  PACIFIC - A FEROCIOUS STORM - NIGHT

     The Hornet tosses, bashed by a vicious storm.

     INT.  CARRIER HORNET - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

     The ships is rolling; most of the fliers are green.
     Doolittle stands at the podium.

                         DOOLITTLE
               Since we'll be on our own once we're in
               the air, I thought I had a good idea
               letting each crew select it's own target.

     He looks at a pile of paper slips in front of him.

                         DOOLITTLE
               Now we have fifteen requests for the
               Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo
               baseball stadium.

                         RED
               I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed
               to p-play baseball.

                         DOOLITTLE
               I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But
               I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The
               idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge.
               We're here to prove to them that they're
               neither invincible nor superior.  So
               let's try this again.  Military targets
               only.

                         RED
               Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy.
               To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And
               to practice it, ya gotta play --

                         DOOLITTLE
               No baseball diamonds, Red.

                         RED
               Y-Yes Sir.

     EXT.  PACIFIC - DAY

     The storm is subsiding, but it's still raining.  From the
     bridge of the Hornet, they spot the ENTERPRISE.

                         ADMIRAL
               The Enterprise will ride shotgun when we
               launch the bombers.  They wanted our
               carriers at Pearl, and now we've come to
               them.  If the Japanese get us, they'll be
               having dinner in San Francisco next
               month.

     EXT.  FLIGHT DECK - THE HORNET - DAY

     The preparations begin.  Deck crews move the B-25's to the
     rear of the flight deck.  Fueling teams top off the bomber's
     gas tanks.  Ordnance men hoist four bombs into each aircraft,
     and the army gunners load ammunition for the machine guns.
     Greening checks the planes' mechanical and hydraulic systems.

     And once again the pilots are out pacing the deck distance.
     It's turned into a game for them, walking off nerves.  As
     Rafe and Danny pass.

                         RAFE
               It's not getting any longer.

                         DANNY
               Longer?  It's getting shorter.

     INT.  HORNET - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

     Doolittle is laying out the plan for all the pilots.

                         DOOLITTLE
               We'll take off late this afternoon.  I'll
               hit Tokyo at dusk, and drop incendiary
               bombs.  You'll come after me at night,
               guided by the fires.  Then it's on to
               China, where you'll arrive at dawn,
               guided to their airfields by the homing
               beacons the Chinese are going to switch
               on for us.  That's if everything is
               perfect -- like every other military
               mission I've ever been involved with.

     Doolittle looks around the room.  No one's smiling.

                         DOOLITTLE
               Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane --
               then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you.
               I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't
               make it, you don't go.

                         RAFE
               Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you
               make it or not.

                         DOOLITTLE
               I know.

     EXT.  BRIDGE OF THE CRUISER NASHVILLE - DAY

     The cruiser Nashville is at the perimeter of the task force.
     It's lookouts spot Japanese patrol boats ahead.

     INT.  BRIDGE OF THE ENTERPRISE - DAY

     The message is handed to Admiral Halsey.

                         OFFICER
               Sir, lookouts on the cruisers report
               patrol boats, ten miles away!

                         HALSEY
               The Japs have set up a picket line!
               Order the cruisers to open fire!  We've
               got to sink them before they get a
               message away.

     EXT.  PACIFIC - DAY

     The cruiser NASHVILLE begins firing rounds at the Japanese
     patrol boat; round after round misses.

     INT.  HORNET'S RADIO ROOM - DAY

     The operators hear the excited voices of Japanese radio
     traffic.

                         RADIO OPERATOR
               They've reported our position!  Tell the
               Admiral.

     EXT.  HORNET - DAY

     Doolittle hurries up to the command bridge, with the naval
     officers sent by the Admiral to fetch him.  Doolittle sees
     the cruisers next to the carrier firing its guns -- at
     Japanese boats in the distance.

     INT.  BRIDGE OF THE HORNET - DAY

     Doolittle finds the Admiral gathered with his staff, their
     mood is grim.

                         DOOLITTLE
               How far are we from Tokyo?

                         ADMIRAL
               Seven hundred miles.

     INT.  PILOT'S WARD ROOMS - SERIES OF DISSOLVES

     Rafe, Danny, and the other pilots are alone at their bunks,
     taking advantage of the lull before the mission.

     Rafe has paper and pen to write a letter, but he can't think
     of anything to write.

     Danny holds the "Picture of Paradise" that Sammy took, of
     Evelyn and the nurses in the sun.  He tucks it inside his
     shirt, when he hears --

                         LOUDSPEAKER
               Army pilots, man your planes!

     EXT.  FLIGHT DECK - THE HORNET - DAY

     The pilots run onto deck.  The cruiser next to the Hornet is
     still firing away at the Japanese patrol boat.

     Doolittle runs onto deck, shouting orders.

                         DOOLITTLE
               Load in every bit of extra gas you can
               carry!  And strip everything you don't
               need out of the planes.  I mean
               EVERYTHING!

     EXT.  HORNET - FLIGHT DECK - STRIPPING THE PLANES - DAY

     It's starting to rain but the guys don't notice at all.
     They're stripping seats out of the planes, tossing out their
     own gear.

     Greening pulls the machine guns out of the rear of the planes
     and puts in broomsticks painted black.

     Off in the distance the Japanese patrol boat takes a hit and
     explodes.  Rafe and Danny meet between their bombers.

                         DANNY
               Broomsticks instead of tail guns.

                         RAFE
               We'll get separated over the target, but
               you and I will rendezvous for the run to
               China.  I'm on your wing.

                         DANNY
               And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.

                         RAFE
               Home of the Brave.

     They climb into their bombers.

     EXT.  HORNET - FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     The engines are revving.  The tachs are showing redline.  The
     crews are in their planes.  Doolittle is first, just ahead of
     Rafe and Danny's B-25's.

     The battle pennants whip, the props blur, the wheels strain
     against the brakes; from the cockpits the flight deck looks
     impossibly short...and the American flag cracks in the wind.

     And now every pilot looks at Doolittle's plane...

     Doolittle starts the run down the flight deck...faster...the
     end looming.  He turns the plane almost vertical, standing it
     on its props...and lifts away smoothly.

     The sailors on deck cheer, like the Japanese did before Pearl
     Harbor.

     Rafe, Danny, and the others take off too.

     EXT.  SKIMMING OVER THE WAVES - DAY

     The B-25's head toward Japan.

     EXT.  PACIFIC - THE AMERICAN TASK FORCE - DAY

     Admiral Halsey, on the deck of the ENTERPRISE, watches as the
     last plane takes off.  The planes recede in the distance,
     racing just a few feet over the water, toward Japan.

                         HALSEY
               Of all the other things this mission is
               doing that have never been done before...
               I've never sent out planes that I wasn't
               going to see safely home.  Let's get out
               of here.

     The task force runs for home.

     EXT.  SKIMMING OVER THE WAVES - DAY

     At first the planes are together; Rafe and Danny can see each
     other off each other's wing, and Doolittle's plane is ahead.
     The others are grouped after them.  They maintain strict
     radio silence, and can communicate only with gestures, hand
     signals, or a flasher for Morse code.  When Rafe speaks to
     the crew of his own plane, it's by pressing an intercom
     sender to his throat.

                         RAFE
               What's our ETA for Tokyo?

     The bombardier/navigator is already working out the numbers
     at his plotting table in the center of the plane.

                         NAVIGATOR
               Almost exactly at 12 noon.

                         RED
               High n-noon.  I k-kinda like that.

     Rafe looks over to Danny and gives him a thumbs up.

     INT.  DANNY'S PLANE - DAY

     Danny calls back to his GUNNER, who is watching the fuel
     supply.

                         DANNY
               We got a 25-mile-an-hour head wind.  How
               we doing with fuel?

                         GUNNER
               How do you think?

     The gunner is already pouring gas into the tanks from the
     extra cans.

     Anthony stands and moves back to the rear of the plane, pulls
     a piece of chalk from his pocket and writes on the nose of
     the bombs -- "For America,"  "For Pearl Harbor,"  "For the
     Arizona,"  "For Billy."

     -- Rafe flies, lost in thought...

     -- Evelyn is back at Pearl, struggling to keep her mind on
        her work.

     -- Danny is looking at his gauges, then at the picture in
        his shirt.

     EXT.  TOKYO - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

     It's a pleasant day, and the people of Tokyo are in a
     confident, happy mood.  They're shopping, smiling, enjoying
     beautiful spring weather.  The Emperor is on the garden of
     his palace having lunch.

     EXT.  SKIMMING OVER THE WAVES - DAY

     The American planes are coming.

     INT.  DOOLITTLE'S PLANE - DAY

     He and his navigator confer.

                         DOOLITTLE'S NAVIGATOR
               Time for the others to break off.

     His copilot uses the flashes to signal the other planes.
     They break off for their individual targets, every plane now
     on it's own.

     INT.  JAPANESE AIR DEFENSE STATION - DAY

     This is the nerve center of Tokyo's defense.  An OFFICER
     receives a message and reports to his supervisor.

                         JAPANESE DEFENSE OFFICER
               Coastal stations report a low flying
               plane coming in off the sea.

                         SUPERVISOR
               From the sea?... That couldn't be right,
               it must be part of the air raid practice
               this morning.

     EXT.  SKIMMING OVER THE WAVES - DAY

     The planes reach the Japanese coastline, and start skimming
     over treetop level.

     EXT.  TOKYO - DAY

     The office of an anti-aircraft battery blows its whistle; his
     crew mount their guns and swerves them around.  The officer
     whistle's again and checks his watch.

                         ANTI-AIRCRAFT OFFICER
               Not bad.

     The crew dismount their guns; just a drill.

     EXT.  TOKYO - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

     The Japanese people are unaware of the drill.  People are
     browsing through open-air shops, where new radios are turned
     on, playing music.  And Tokyo Rose is talking -- in English
     and Japanese.

                         TOKYO ROSE (ON THE RADIO)
               It is another beautiful day in Tokyo, as
               all of Japan basks in a new day of
               victory.

     INT.  THE PLANES - DAY

     Coma, Danny's navigator, picks this up.

                         COMA
               Listen to this -- it's Tokyo Rose.

                         TOKYO ROSE (ON THE RADIO)
               Our brave sailors and soldiers, inspired
               by our divine Emperor, have pushed the
               Americans from the Pacific.

     These words go through the plane; and in the other planes
     they hear it too.

                         TOKYO ROSE (ON THE RADIO)
               But hiding at home will not save them.
               Each time the Americans have tasted the
               samurai spirit, they have learned the
               bitter taste of defeat, while Japan is
               embraced by the divine wind that has
               protected our island for seven centuries.

     EXT.  TOKYO - DAY

     The planes reach Tokyo, and flash across the rooftops.

     INT.  DANNY'S PLANE - DAY

                         ANTHONY
               We'll give that bitch something to
               announce.

     Danny and Rafe give each other a wave, and divert toward
     their separate targets.  Each plane is on its own now.

     EXT.  TOKYO - DAY

     Doolittle's plane flashes right over the Emperor's palace.
     The Emperor sits in the garden, meditating.

     EXT.  TOKYO - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

     Mothers walking their children see the planes flash by
     overhead, and like the people at Pearl, they think they are
     friendlies.  A toddler points up and smiles.  His mother
     picks him up and hugs him happily.

                         JAPANESE MOTHER
               Yes!  So beautiful!

     INT.  THE PLANES - DAY

     Rafe's bombardier works his 20-cent bombsight, as Rafe holds
     the plane steady, bringing it up to 200 feet.

     They scan for fighter or anti-aircraft fire.  There isn't
     any.

                         RAFE
               Open bomb bay doors.

     DANNY'S PLANE runs toward its target...

     DOOLITTLE'S PLANE races over Tokyo...

                         GUNNER
               Bomb bay doors open, sir.

                         RAFE
               It's all yours.

     The bombardier hits the first switch.  The bomb falls toward
     a factory.

     It strikes home, right on target.  The blast is shocking --
     it blows debris higher than the plane.

     EXT.  TOKYO - THE BOMBING - VARIOUS SHOTS

     The individual planes drop their bombs, four per plane, on
     shipyards, factories, oil supplies, weapons facilities.
     Their bombing is highly accurate.

     On the ground, at the open-air market, for a brief moment
     Radio Tokyo goes silent; then --

                         TOKYO ROSE (ON THE RADIO)
               We interrupt this broadcast... Tokyo is
               being bombed!

     EXT.  THE EMPEROR'S PALACE - DAY

     The Emperor looks up at the sound of air raid sirens and
     distant explosions.

                         EMPEROR'S ATTENDANT
               Surely just a drill, Divine One.

     INT.  RAFE'S PLANE - DAY

                         NAVIGATOR
               Last bomb away.

     It slams into a factory, blowing debris everywhere and
     turning the factory into an inferno.

     Rafe's tail gunner sees Zeros swarming in with vengeance.

                         GUNNER
               We got Zeros!  And they're pissed off!

     Rafe changes course quickly.

     INT.  DANNY'S PLANE - DAY

     Anti-aircraft FLAK bursts in the sky in front of them; Danny
     takes evasive action.

     INT.  RAFE'S PLANE - ABOVE TOKYO - DAY

     Rafe pushes the engines to top speed and changes course
     again; but the B-25's can't outrun the Zeros.  Their fire
     chews into the bomber's tail, hitting the gunner.  Red
     scrambles back to find the gunner dead.

                         RAFE
               Can you get 'em off us?

     Red reacting to bullets coming through the rear of the
     fuselage, looks at the brooms protruding from the rear of the
     plane.

                         RED
               Whatta ya want me to do, sweep 'em!

     As the bombardier, navigator, and Red jump onto the other
     machine guns, Rafe looks for a way out.  He dives down toward
     the city.  The Zeros follow.

     EXT.  SKIES OVER TOKYO - DAY

     Rafe takes the B-25 right down among the buildings, sometimes
     even having to spin the wings to get through.  The Zeros
     can't keep up with this...

     But Rafe can't keep it up long, either; they break out into
     open ground rail yards, where there's no place for him to
     hide...

     The Zeros come in to chew him up...

     But they take fire from another B-25 -- Danny's -- coming in
     to save Rafe's plane.  Rafe now uses the radio.

                         RAFE
               Danny, get the hell out of here!

     But Danny stays, mixing it up with the Zeros; with both
     B-25's together, their machine guns down one Zero and damage
     another.  But there are too many.

     Rafe sees clouds coming in, and fog.

                         RAFE
               Danny, run for the clouds!

     The bombers race toward the clouds, and make it; the Zeros
     lose them.

     EXT.  SKIES - BROKEN CLOUDS - DAY

     Rafe and Danny keep broken contact through the clouds, and
     settle in for the long run to China.

     INT.  RAFE'S COCKPIT - DAY

                         RAFE
               We burned a lot of fuel back there.
               Flash them and ask about their supply.

     INT.  DANNY'S PLANE - DAY

     Anthony reads the Morse code.

                         ANTHONY
               "How's your fuel?"

     Danny looks across to Rafe and shakes his head.

     INT.  ROOSEVELT'S RESIDENCE - HYDE PARK, NY - DAY

     Roosevelt is at his desk when General Marshall enters.

                         GENERAL MARSHALL
               We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President.
               Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own
               broadcast to make the announcement.

                         ROOSEVELT
               Have the planes made it to China?

                         GENERAL MARSHALL
               There've been some complications, Sir.
               The Chinese didn't receive our request
               for homing beacons until is was too late
               to get them set.  And the planes had to
               take off so early they may lack fuel to
               make the mainland anyway.

                         ROOSEVELT
               So those brave men are flying blind and
               running out of fuel.

                         GENERAL MARSHALL
               The Chinese are sending out search
               parties to try to find the crews before
               the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes
               make it.

                         ROOSEVELT
               God help them.

     EXT.  SEA OF JAPAN - DUSK

     They've climbed above the clouds; the fliers are exhausted.

     The sun is beginning to set.  Rafe stares at it...

     INT.  HOSPITAL - PEARL HARBOR - DUSK

     The place is white again -- the white of bandages and casts.
     Everyone is busy, and even the wounded are looking out for
     each other; a man with his arms in an airplane splint holds a
     spoon and feeds a badly burned buddy.  Evelyn and her
     overworked nurses are looking after the critical cases.  But
     as she covers the windows with blackout curtains, she stops
     for just a moment to stare at the sun's last rays.

     EXT.  SKIES OVER PACIFIC - NIGHT

     Colonel Doolittle can make out mountains below them.

                         DOOLITTLE
               We'll fly till we run out of fuel, then
               bail out.

     Just then his engines start to sputter.

                         DOOLITTLE
               Chute!

     He puts the plane on auto-pilot and the men move to the
     hatches.  Three guys go out; it's just Doolittle and his
     copilot left.

                         DOOLITTLE
               Nobody else is gonna make it either.  If
               I live through this, they're gonna put me
               in Leavenworth Prison.

     They jump.

     INT.  DANNY'S PLANE - NIGHT

     Coma moves up to Danny.

                         COMA
               We're running out of fuel.  And I can't
               find the beacon.

     Danny gestures across to Rafe that he hears nothing in his
     radio phones.  Rafe gestures the same thing back.

     They look down and the entire ground is covered with clouds.

                         RAFE
               I don't know if we're over sea or land.
               Drop flares and try to spot something.

     EXT.  SKIES OVER PACIFIC - NIGHT

     They drop flares; they disappear into the cloud cover and
     tell them nothing.

     EXT.  SKIES - RAFE AND DANNY'S PLANE - NIGHT

     Danny's engines are sputtering; his gunner pours the last
     drops of gas into the tanks.

                         DANNY
               Flash Rafe.  We're gonna bail.

     Red sees Anthony signal.

                         RED
               They've gotta jump.

                         RAFE
               Not unless we know he's over land!

     Rafe yells at Danny, as if he could hear --

                         RAFE
               You are not bailing out into water!

                         RAFE'S NAVIGATOR
               Coastline below!

     Through a break in the clouds they spot a rocky shoreline.

                         RAFE
               We've got coast!  Signal him to climb and
               jump.

     Red signals; Danny's plane signals back.

                         RED
               They don't have fuel to make altitude.
               He's gonna set it down in the water.

     Rafe looks over at Danny, who is gesturing; he gives up on
     the hand signals and grabs the flasher; Red reads the Morse
     code...

                         RED
               Y-O-U... G-O.  You go on.

     Rafe grabs the flasher and angrily flashes back two letters.

                         RAFE
               N-O!  We stay together!  I'll go in
               first.

     Rafe turns his bomber and Danny follows, their planes arcing
     down toward the rocky coast; it's hairy, the clouds masking
     their view, as the altimeter winds down... At the last moment
     they see rocks looming out of the surf.

     INT.  RAFE'S PLANE - NIGHT

     He's shouting to his crew --

                         RAFE
               Hang on tight!  I'll put her in the
               smooth water and we'll swim in!

     INT.  DANNY'S PLANE - NIGHT

     His engines are sputtering, catching, sputtering; he fights
     to stay in control.

     EXT.  CHINA COAST - NIGHT

     Rafe's plane settles down toward the water; he guns the
     engine to level out, and the plane skims across the surface;
     then the propellers catch and the plane stops like it hit a
     wall, flipping over it's nose.

     DANNY'S PLANE is struggling; when he tries to add throttle,
     the engines sputter out.  The plane drops, skips once on the
     surface, then hits a shoreline rock belly first.

     Danny and Anthony are ejected through the top of the
     fuselage; Coma is hurled forward right through the glass nose
     of the plane.

     INT.  RAFE'S PLANE - NIGHT

     Rafe and Red come to in the plane inverted and sinking.  They
     react, unbuckling, grabbing for their crewmates as the plane
     is quickly filling.  The navigator and gunner are
     unconscious; the bombardier is dead.  Red struggles with the
     hatch and can't make it budge.

                         RAFE
               It won't open til the plane fills!

     They struggle to breath as the water envelops them.  But as
     the water reaches the top, Rafe takes a last breath and dives
     to the hatch; it comes open, and they swim up, dragging the
     rest of the crew.

     EXT.  CHINA COAST - NIGHT

     They break the surface, and struggle to shore with the
     unconscious navigator and gunner.

     Rafe's looking everywhere; he sees Danny's plane crashed
     against the rock.  He fights his way through the surf to
     Danny's plane, Red following.

     Rafe finds Danny face up in the water.

     Red finds Anthony on the rock.  He's face up, but as Red
     lifts him he finds the back of Anthony's head is gone.

     The rest of Danny's crew are floating in the surf, dead.
     Rafe and Red pull Danny to shore.

                         RAFE
               Danny!  DANNY!

     Danny's eyes flutter open; he sees Rafe and mumbles --

                         DANNY
               I've made better landings.

     Danny's hand gropes to his throat; Rafe finds a V shaped
     shard of the fuselage hooked into his neck.

     Rafe grabs it, trying to bend it open; the sharp metal cuts
     his hands, but he keeps straining.  It won't work, He pulls
     his .45 from his jacket and tries to pry the metal.  It works
     a bit; he tosses the pistol aside and grabs the shard again,
     and opens it.

                         RAFE
               You hang on, Danny!  You hang on!  You're
               gonna make it!

     Rafe's head snaps forward, crunched with the butt of a rifle;
     a Japanese patrol, four men, have arrived.  They're angry,
     scared, hyped.  They knock Red down too, yelling and
     brandishing their rifles at the fliers on the beach, living
     and dead.

     The Japanese officer is barking orders.  They find the
     Captain's insignia on Danny's jacket, and begin binding him
     to a yoke, his wrists tied to the wood like a crucifixion, a
     wire around his neck.  They find the navigator unconscious,
     but alive.  The officer snaps a single word and a soldier
     shoots the navigator.

     The others wire Rafe's ankles together... Rafe is
     emotionless.

     RAFE'S CONSCIOUSNESS fades in and out.  He hears Danny
     choking, and his mind sees Danny as a boy those long years
     ago, being carried by the neck across the field by his
     father...

     Then Rafe sees THE PRESENT:  Danny being half-carried, half-
     dragged by the neck by two Japanese.  The officer is pulling
     Red along, hands bound behind him.  And Rafe starts moving,
     being dragged on his back, pulled by his feet along the rocky
     sand.

     His hand slides by the pistol he tossed behind the rock.

     The whole world slows down.

     He clutches it, shoots one of the men towing Danny.  And as
     the man dragging Rafe turns around, Rafe shoots him in the
     face.

     The officer spins, raising his rifle; the soldier pulling
     Red, shoves him onto his face in the sand and aims his rifle
     too.  The officer is pulling the trigger to kill Rafe when
     Danny slams him down from behind.

     The fourth soldier shoots Danny in the gut, then takes aim
     for Rafe's heart -- and is shot through the chest from
     behind.

     The Japanese officers rises in surprise and is cut down by
     scythes carried by the Chinese peasant soldiers who are just
     arriving.

     Rafe struggles to Danny, moving the Chinese aside.  Danny
     lies on his back, clutching his wound as if to hold onto his
     life.

                         RAFE
               Danny...

                         DANNY
               I can't make it.

                         RAFE
               Yes you can.

     But Danny is silent, his eyes drifting shut, and in that
     moment Rafe thinks he is gone already.  Then Danny's eyes
     drift open, finding him.

                         DANNY
               Take care of Evelyn.

     The words almost kill Rafe, filling him with grief.  From
     somewhere he finds the strength to say --

                         RAFE
               I will.  And your baby.
                    (beat)
               You're gonna be a father.

     Did Danny hear?  His eyes are closed again.  But his head
     comes up; Rafe takes it, and Danny pulls him closer to
     whisper --

                         DANNY
               No.  You are.

     Rafe cradles Danny in his arms.  Danny's eyes are open, but
     Rafe sees no light there.

                         RAFE
               Danny... Land of the free... Land of the
               free...

     But Danny will never answer him again.  Rafe hugs Danny
     tight, and weeps.

     EXT.  VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

     The news of the raid hits Washington...and the rest of
     America.  If it isn't wild celebration; when people see the
     headline:  AIR RAID ON TOKYO, and DOOLITTLE DOES MUCH; their
     faces change, as if finally told what they already knew --
     that America would prevail.

                         VOICE OVER
               The Doolittle Raid was the pivotal moment
               of America's war with Japan.  Before it,
               America knew nothing but defeat; after
               it, nothing but victory.
                    (beat)
               One crew of Doolittle's raiders made it to
               Vladivostok, Russia, where they were
               interred for much of the war.  Thirteen
               planes crash landed in China, where the
               Chinese people helped the Americans
               escape, and had their villages destroyed
               and citizens executed by the Japanese
               forces of occupation.  Two crews were
               captured by the Japanese and three fliers
               were executed without trial, called "war
               criminals" by the Japanese.  Jimmy
               Doolittle was promoted to General, and
               given the medal of honor.

     We see the ceremony at the White House, as Roosevelt presents
     Doolittle with the metal.

     EXT.  TENNESSEE - DAY

     Out by the crop dusting landing field is a memorial to Danny
     Walker, with an American flag flying high above it.  Standing
     at the memorial are Rafe and Evelyn.  Rafe holds a child in
     his arms, a boy, named Danny.

                                        FADE OUT.

                         THE END
