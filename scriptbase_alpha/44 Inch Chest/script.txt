   PROLOGUE

   Stagnant black water ... Greasy. Pitch. Thick. Oily.
   Dense. Heavy... Lapping... Slow.... A desolate canal... Night.

   Onto dark stones... rain-slicked... darkest slate-grey cobbles...

   And on through streets... Narrow.        Grimy.     Sooty.   Rank...
   Deserted...

   Pastal-disused Victorian broken-windowed, derelict
   buildings and wharf side warehouses with rotten oaky loading
   beams and rusted iron chains... Mossy, mildewed walls... Dripping
   fetid water from corroded dilapidated ancient ruined
   guttering...

   Moving... Turning... Into a pinched, arched, alleyway -- If
   anything darker, blacker... Foreboding... Forsaken...

   And if we listen -- If we strain our ears -- listen -- we can
   hear music -- faint. Ghostly. Haunting ... "Take Me Back To
   Dear Ol' Blighty " as if sung by a jolly girl in a long gone
   bar surrounded by drunken men...

   We keep moving... The music growing... In the distance a faint
   glow.... Dirty-yellow, diffused, misty light... We move towards
   it... Towards the piss-coloured light...

   We stop... In the middle of nowhere... Dark nowhere... and the
   music fades... Fades away... Vanished... Extreme silence... All we
   have is all we can see...

   The gable end of an old house.... Limey-light bleeding weakly
   from a broken, filthy window... All is still -- suddenly it
   comes crashing down -- the end wall comes crashing down - a
   flurry of bricks and mortar... Crashing down... The tumble of
   masonry... And through clouds of brick-dust and rubble we see
   figures inside... Through a smokey powdered fog we can see a
   group of men in the downstairs room of the derelict house...

   On the walls faded 40's wallpaper, peeling in parts to reveal
   older dim patterns... damp patches... A window crudely boarded
   up... A few unmatched armchairs in various states of disrepair
   -- a 60's black vinyl, a deco-patterned smoker, a 70's cream
   plastic, a brown wooden kitchen chair etc... The colours in
   the room are browns, greys, caramels, darks, muted...

   In the middle of the room, standing on dusty, bare wooden
   floorboards, his fist clenched aggressively by his sides, is
   OLD MAN PEANUT, aged 80... Skinny... Wearing a dark three piece
   suit... Gold watch chain... Black Homburg... He is squaring up to
   us... Staring...




                                                                  
                                                                    3.

   Slightly behind, to his left, sitting nonchalantly cross-
   legged in a battered brown leather wingback armchair and
   casually smoking a Davidoff cigarette, is MEREDITH, late
   40's... Suave... Immaculate... Wearing black handmade boots, black
   Saville Row suit, black cashmere roll neck sweater, herring
   bone overcoat with a black velvet collar, brown leather
   gloves, his jet-black hair is heavily brilliantined.... Behind
   him an old wardrobe...

   Standing with his back three quarters to us, and leaning on a
   broken, chipped, mantelpiece over a smashed tiled fireplace
   is ARCHIE, aged 52... Big... Avuncular... Wearing a car coat and
   casual nondescript clothes... he is pouring himself a Captain
   Morgan's rum from a bottle into a polystyrene cup... He sort
   of sees us -- is not fussed -- drinks...

   Standing at the back of the room, in front of a door which             *
   has at some time been on fire, (it's yellowing, tobacco-ey
   paint charred and blistered), is MAL, aged mid-40's... Wearing
   a silver-grey suit, white shirt, duck-egg blue silk tie...

   There is another man in the room but we do not see his face --
   for he s its slu mpe d, h ead in his han ds in o ne of t he
   armchairs - a picture of despair. He wears an olive green
   shirt, brown trousers, maroon braces... This is COLIN, aged
   late 40's...

   Blackness and silence...

   In the silent black an outsize boot appears - scuffed and
   tatty... Attached to skinny legs in black tights... The legs
   gangle and flip pulling into view a bony, pasty, bare torso
   which is undulating oddly -- and here comes the head! - Long,
   lank, shoulder length hair... Dripping from a white domed pate
   - The face poker straight in contrast to the comedic body-
   antics -- A grave-grey face -- Fleshy, bulbous, rubbery...
   Ladies and Gentlemen -- MAX WALL!

   He goon-walks about for a bit in the black space... Baboon-
   bottomed... As if knees tied together... Aflickin' and akickin'
   his clown boots... His unhappy face... Like death... Prancing...
   Ridiculous dancing... Absurd...

   Giant C/U on his morose contorted phizzog...

    MUSIC... `WITHOUT YOU' by NILSSON...

    We are out of focus on purple... white... scattered sparkling
    "jewels"? begin to come into focus and we see that they are
    in fact pieces of broken glass... Thousands of splinters and
    shards strewn across a purple Wilton carpet... the white fur
    of a luxurious sheepskin rug in bits... Ripped to shreds... In
    extreme C/U we begin to move along the floor slowly taking in
    mor e de bri s of d est ru ct io n... Sm as he d c ha ir s... Sm as he d
    photographs... Broken records... Ripped, shredded record
    sleeves -- `THE POWER OF LOVE' by JENNIFER RUSH -- `HOPELESSLY
    DEVOTED TO YOU' by OLIVIA NEWTON JOHN -- `I WILL ALWAYS LOVE
    YOU' by WHITNEY HOUSTON etc.

    The TV remote smashed to smithereens... The television --
    widescreen -- TOTALLED!... We move along the plush `World of
    Leather' leather sofa... See that a chunk has been bitten out
    of it... See teeth marks -- like a bite out of cheese!... Moving
    on past an area of slashed carpet and underfelt... Approaching
    the legs of a si deboard and see ing into the bla ckness
    underneath... We can just make out the quizzical, frightened
    eyes of a white poodle... We move on... Past twisted, wrecked
    lampshades... Broken plates, ornaments... An up-ended vase of
    half-eaten flowers... NILSSON continues his self-pitying
    overwrought ballad and as he hits the massive, masochistic
    chorus/crescendo we come across COLIN lying rigid on his back
    in the corner of the devastated room... His shocked eyes
    staring wildly... His body petrified. Paralysed... As if frozen
    at the height of an epileptic fit -- Like something from
    Pompeii -- Like Max Schrek as Nosferatu hit by light... We stay
    on COLIN... His uncomprehending terror-filled eyes... His sheer
    rigor mortis-like horror... We move in on him... Into the black
    of his eyes... The tragic, agonised black..

    We are outside, square on to an upstairs window of a detached
    suburban villa... We hear muffled sounds from inside the house...
    Yells... Screaming... Cries... Commotion... And suddenly the glass
    window explodes towards us as a desperate terrified woman
    comes crashing through... Having run full pelt to escape from
    something... This is LIZ, aged 44...

    Music `WITHOUT YOU' by NILSSON...

    COLIN, as before, lying in the wrecked room... The music ends...
    Suddenly we hear ARCHIE'S voice ...

                               ARCHIE'S VOICE
                       (Gently)
                 ... Col... Col... C'mon mate this is no good...
                 Colin...

    We now see ARCHIE sitting in a nearby armchair, smoking,
    patient...

                             ARCHIE
                 ... C'mon mate, you can't lie `ere forever!

    The rigid COLIN, ignoring him, has suddenly, belatedly,
    realised that the music has stopped... Desperately needing his
    friend, NILSSON -- like a man in excruciating pain reaching
    for a gallon of morphine, he frantically, urgently twists his
    body on the floor and reaching behind, hammers the play
    button on the nearby ghetto blaster... And slowly, gently,
    kindly, the piano intro of NILSSON'S gorgeous wallow re-
    commences... Colin, somewhat soothed, eases back into his
    former rigid, mortified position.

     ARCHIE is walking away... BIGGY and ROSEMARY in the other
     direction... Suddenly BIGGY stop's... turns... stares darkly
     at the departing figure of ARCHIE who ambles off unaware...
     BIGGY is staring with such hatred... we move in on his
     face... His hating face... we are close up... he stares just
     off camera... seems he is growling... low... primal growls...
     and now his hand, claw-like, comes into frame... he is
     reaching towards us... threatening-ly ... and slowly his
     hating eyes follow... and he is staring right at us...

12   INT ROOM IN DERELICT HOUSE   NIGHT                            12

     The room is as described in the prologue albeit with gable
     wall intact... MAL stands by the crumbling mantelpiece his
     back to the room... Touches the back of his head as if
     something has brushed against him... Over this we hear...

               ...Bells, aintcha?

     MAL glances over his shoulder... ARCHIE is crouching over and
     sorting through a card-board box containing various bottles
     of spirits...

     the armchairs... Opens the bottle...

     Slowly COLIN goes towards the figure... Stands in front of

     Suddenly his hands grab at the black plastic- he roughly
     tears it open eventually revealing the bloody vest and pant-
     ed body ... Now he slowly lifts the crumpled Tesco bag from
     the head and we see the bowed, beaten face of LOVERBOY, early
     30's ... Eventually...

                            COLIN (CONT) (CONT'D)
                  You know-you're not a bad looking boy!..
                  Yeah, I can see the attraction!... Young
                  ... fit ... well built ... sexy ... but
                  if you don't mind my sayin' so - isn't it
                  all a bit obvious? Bit of a cliché? ...
                  (PAUSE) What was she doing? ... Silly cow
                  ... What a stupid woman!...

     COLIN slowly returns to his seat ... Uncaps the brandy ...
     Pours some into the cap and drinks it...

     His face is blank. Heartless. Matter of fact. Grizzled.
     Cold. His eyes dull. Black. Stony ... He is thick set... Bear-
     like... He wears a scruffy tweed coat ... A flat working man's
     cap a thick, battered gypsy belt-and he is busy bundling a
     live cockerel into the Hessian sack before him ... In with
     the snake ... In with the dog ... In with the man - the
     beaten, terrified, whimpering man in the sack...the four
     creatures in there together ... Pandemonium in the sack as he
     ties it off ... Brutishly dragging the hellish parcel to the
     edge of the pier-and lazily booting it into the dark sea
     below .. . He tur ns now . .. His task com pleted . .. And
     couldn't give a monkeys as he looks with zero compassion down

                here - like his head's by my chin ... So
                I've eased him back a tad and I says, 'ow
                much were these again? ... and he's told
                me ... repeated it ... Four 'undred and

     He turns...and we now see the others back in the room ...
     But... LIZ's head is on MEREDITH'S body she smokes ...
     MEREDITH'S head is on ARCHIE'S body he leans on the
     mantelpiece ... ARCHIE'S head is on MAL's body standing ...
     MAL's head is OLD MAN PEANUT's body sitting...

     C/U on COLIN'S face ... He can't believe it ... Addresses
     the MEREDITH/LIZ person

               What's 'appenin', Meredith?

     But this figure does not reply ... The response comes from
     the LIZ/MEREDITH combo...

                    voice)
               Oh, gawd! !

     COLIN confused ... Fascinated ... Scared ... Especially by
     the relaxed, cross legged, smoking, sexy-bodied, feminine
     form disturbingly topped with the nasty old head of OLD MAN
     PEANUT ... it speaks...

                  uniform... but I'll be damned if I'm
                  gonna look at her... I know she's

     descending ... and now OLD MAN PEANUT appears ... carrying
     a battered old suitcase ... he opens the heavy, wooden,
     studded, creaking, dungeon door and enters ... we see a
     figure, trussed up in bin bags and with an old Tesco bag on
     its head hanging from a meat-hook ... it struggles...OLD
     MAN PEANUT slams down the case ... opens it ... inside a
     jumbled variety of rusty tools /gadgets/ implements....
     from the tangled hardware he manages to extract a thick,
     rusty file ... an ancient heavy plane...a mallet-and a six
     inch nail ... uttering to himself...

                I was a bit nervous at first... fear of
                the unknown I s'pose... well you get set

     A vignette of his MUM and HAZEL (50) sitting on an old
     sofa, drinking tea and chatting happily... Behind them on a
     floral wallpapered wall is a painting -- Spanish/Woolworth's
     style... Carmenesque... A wounded 18th Century soldier is
     slumped in a chair being tended to by a wild, exotic,
     gypsy, flamenco-type woman... Nearby, standing alarmed,
     humiliated and cuckolded wearing a white frilly, puffy-
     sleeved shirt, red breeches with a gold stripe, black
     boots, is the shocked faced husband... These three
     characters bearing an uncanny resemblance to guess who?...
     C/U on ARCHIE as he turns back to look at us... (the vignette
     has gone)...

                  (raises his eyebrows. Intimate with
                  us). Say a prayer for me!

     We can just see part of MAL... His face half in shadow... He
     is looking at us... Edgy... Defensive... Dodgy... He slips into the
     shadows... Is gone...

     COLIN emerges onto the street... Closes the door behind
     him... We move in on his brave/sad face as he gazes up at
     the old, bluey, London sky, and says to Liz's spirit...

                       quiet)
                  Be lucky, Liz.

     Slowly he begins to walk the wet street... Away from us...
     Towards his new life...


     THE END
