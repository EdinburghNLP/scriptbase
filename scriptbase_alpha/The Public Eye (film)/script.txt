               FADE IN: BEGIN TITLES

               In murky light, a piece of paper sinks in a shallow tin tub. 
               By degrees, faces and forms appear on the page: a swooning 
               woman, (circa 1940) a cop who tries to catch her, a crowd of 
               onlookers standing in the shadows of a tenement house in the 
               aftermath of a murder. Before the photograph has completely 
               developed, it seems to fade in a dreamy

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               Another submerged page. A new images begins to appear: a 
               thick-ankled stripper (again, 1940) sleeping between shows 
               in her dingy dressing room. Before it has fully developed, 
               this photo also

                                                              DISSOLVES TO:

               A new page on which appears a billboard attached to a burning 
               building. It advertises a 1930's sunburn medication: "Put 
               out the flames with SunzoCaine!" Painted flames rises from a 
               sunbather's burnt back, mixing with the real ones.

               We continue sensuously to DISSOLVE THROUGH black and white, 
               high-contrast photos as they come hauntingly to life (all of 
               them depicting New York, at night, in the late 30's or early 
               40's) till we END TITLES.

               We PAN TO the dim red darkroom bulb, under which we begin to 
               hear a faint siren and

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               ...another red bulb, this one atop a patrol car.

               EXT./INT. POLICE CAR [APRIL, 1942] - NIGHT

               We hear a Dispatcher's monotonous voice over a hissing police 
               radio.

                                     DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                         Signal 30. Two-three-six Thompson 
                         Street.

               Inside the car, the Young Cop who's driving angles forward 
               in his seat, pressing heavily on the gas.

               His older partner stares forward, blankly.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. 236 THOMPSON STREET - SAME

               A respectable working-class block. Neighbors are clustered 
               by the stoop in robes, pajamas, undershirts. A woman with 
               young children holds them to her nightgown. All watch as The 
               Cops pull up by the curb and rush from their squadcar. They 
               push their way through the crowd.

                                     TEENAGER
                              (in an undershirt, 
                              grinning)
                         Third floor.

               The Cops continue into the building.

               INT. STAIRWELL - 236 THOMPSON

               The Cops move stealthfully up the dim stairwell, guns drawn.

               On the third-floor landing, a door is ajar. Light spills out 
               onto the floorboards.

               As they ascend, the Cops can see the corpse of a smartly 
               dressed young man inside:

               It lies face down, its features rudely pressed and bloody 
               against the floor. A freshly-blocked hat lies a few feet 
               from the dead man; he was shot as he came home.

               On the landing, the Cops move carefully to the door, hugging 
               the wall.

               They hear someone moving inside the apartment. They freeze, 
               barely breathing.

               The older Cop cocks his gun, crosses himself, wraps his hand 
               around the doorframe. He jumps into

               THE APARTMENT

               crouching, gun drawn. A crackling, blistering sound is heard 
               as a flash of light fills the room, blinding him.

                                     COP
                              (blinking as he stands)
                         Jesus.

               REVERSE:

               A flashbulb hits the floor hollowly.

               BERNZY (whose real name is Leon Bernstein and whose 
               professional name is "The Great Bernzini") inserts a new 
               bulb in the giant chrome flash attachment of his Speed Graphic 
               press camera. A cigar is planted in the corner of his mouth.

               Bernzy cuts a curious figure: He wears an oddly oversized 
               suit that has capacious pockets to accommodate camera lenses, 
               film plates and flashbulbs. His thick-soled shoes are sensible 
               to a fault. He wears a hat but no tie.

               His face is alert and ironic, his movements rapid and 
               purposeful.

                                     BERNZY
                              (to the Cop, deadpan)
                         You scared me.

               He reaches into his jacket to extract a new 4 x 5 glass film 
               plate (from a bag of plates hung over his shoulder) with a 
               well-practised, unhurried speed.

               The older cop, O'BRIEN, is annoyed; his comment sounds like 
               an accusation.

                                     O'BRIEN
                         We weren't six blocks from here when 
                         it come over the radio.

               Bernzy is lining up another shot; he speaks from behind both 
               cigar and camera.

                                     BERNZY
                         I killed him. To get the pictures.

               The Young Cop has entered. Bernzy waves him back.

                                     BERNZY
                         You're casting a shadow.

               He backs up, obligingly. Bernzy takes his shot.

               The Young Cop kneels by the corpse. He finds a gun in the 
               waist-band of its suit trousers.

                                     YOUNG COP
                              (to O'Brien)
                         Second one this week.

                                     O'BRIEN
                              (to Bernzy)
                         Who'd this guy work for, Bernzy?

               But Bernzy hears a car pulling up outside, a car door 
               slamming. He peers down into the street through the window. 

               BERNZY'S POV:

               Another Photographer is arriving. He crosses the street, 
               lugging a press camera.

                                     O'BRIEN
                         Bernzy!

                                     BERNZY
                         I think Farinelli. But he's not 
                         lookin' his best tonight... Could 
                         you move his hat closer?

                                     O'BRIEN
                         What?

                                     BERNZY
                         His hat. The hat. People like to see 
                         a dead guy's hat.

               O'Brien grudgingly picks up the hat, drops it closer to the 
               corpse.

               The flashbulb fires.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

               Bernzy, in the alley alongside the building, is hunched over 
               the open trunk of his sedan on a camp stool.

               The car trunk has been turned into a darkroom. The truck 
               lamp has been replaced with a darkroom bulb. A drying line 
               is suspended over a shallow tub. (Also in the trunk are two 
               dozen boxes of Wabash super-flash photo lamps, an open box 
               of cigars, a pot of glue, various cameras and lenses, and a 
               tiny, battered typewriter.)

               Bernzy looks up into the apartment window as the explosion 
               of a flashbulb-fills the window.

               Bernzy unpins four nearly dry photos on the line, fans them 
               in the air, lays them face down on the trunk floor, and stamps 
               their backs with his identifying imprint:

               Deco lettering is surround by the stamped outline of an eye, 
               like something on an optometrist's sign. Around the upper 
               and lower lids of the eye it says "CREDIT PHOTO TO - THE 
               GREAT BERNZINI". In the center of the eye it says "THE PUBLIC 
               EYE"

               He slams the trunk shut.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DAILY NEWS BUILDING - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON a Daily News check, made out to Leon Bernstein. On 
               a stub, the check is carefully accounted for.

                    1 Corpse (2 bullets @ $1.50 each)............$3.00

               Bernzy, riding down in an elevator, folds the check into his 
               pocket.

               INT. DAILY NEWS LOBBY

               The elevator doors open, Bernzy steps out.

               The Photographer we saw leaving Thompson St. steps into the 
               lobby.

               He only has to see Bernzy to know he's too late.

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
                         Shit.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT./EXT. BERNZY'S SEDAN/STREET - NIGHT

               Bernzy drives, his eyes intently scanning the nighttime 
               street.

               A steady, low hiss is emitted from a police radio, that is 
               gerry-rigged under his dusty dashboard, swaying on its wires. 
               A metal plate on the radio says FOR POLICE VEHICLES ONLY.

               Bernzy's Speed Graphic, with flash, sits on the seat next to 
               him.

               As Bernzy reads every shadow and doorway for potential 
               pictures,

               We see what he sees out the window (buildings and people) in 
               black and white, slightly overcranked: the POV of Bernzy's 
               trained eye.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

               On the landing of the stairwell, a young Puerto Rican Woman 
               wails hysterically as two Cops try to calm her down. She's 
               in her nightgown. A flashbulb fires over her.

               The narrow stairway is packed with Policemen and Puerto Rican 
               neighbors in their T-shirts, pajamas and robes.

               A COP leads two Ambulance Attendants, with a stretcher, up 
               the stairs shouting as he goes.

                                     COP
                         Clear the way, get back, c'mon, c'mon, 
                         c'mon --

               Now he passes Bernzy, near the top of the stairs --

                                     COP
                         Bernzy, clear outta here.

               Bernzy is taken aback --

                                     BERNZY
                         But I hear this guy's walkin' around 
                         with a meat cleaver in his head -- !

               -- as if it's every man's God-given right to photograph such 
               a rare sight.

                                     COP
                         Get the Hell out.

               As the Cop heads into the Woman's apartment, he speaks to 
               the ambulance Attendants, but looks at Bernzy as he does so.

                                     COP
                         Throw a sheet over him.

               The Cop is suspiciously keen to thwart Bernzy: Bernzy smells 
               something.

               He turns to a Puerto Rican MAN, the next door neighbor, who 
               watches in his T-shirt and boxers.

                                     BERNZY
                         Who is this guy, anyway?

                                     MAN
                              (Puerto Rican accent)
                         Working for the Mayor. Visits at 
                         night.

               Bernzy sizes up the elements of the tragedy as the Orderlies 
               bring the victim out of the apartment. He looks at the 
               hysterical mistress and then at her victim/paramour, who is 
               covered with a sheet, but moving (with a comically high 
               protrusion where the meat cleaver is lodged).

               Bernzy -- his eyes as keen as a fox's -- takes a last look 
               at the covered stretcher -- not a good picture -- then heads 
               quickly down the stairs.

               EXT. TENEMENT HOUSE - NIGHT

               Bernzy opens the cavernous trunk of his car. He sorts through 
               a cigar box containing various tools of the photographer's 
               trade, including a scissors he uses to crop prints. He picks 
               up the scissors.

               He strips off his coat.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TENEMENT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

               The Attendants load the stretcher into the back of the waiting 
               limousine. People watch, Bernzy not among them.

               One of the Attendants climbs in back, the other gets in the 
               front, next to the Driver.

               The ambulance pulls out. Siren.

               INT. AMBULANCE - SAME

               Bernzy sits in the back of the ambulance. He has cut a square 
               in the back of his jacket collar, then put the jacket on 
               backwards, to simulate a clerical collar.

                                     BERNZY
                              (to the Attendant)
                         Better uncover him, son.

               The Attendant complies. We don't see the corpse, but the 
               handle of the meat cleaver juts up ludicrously into the frame 
               and it moves back and forth as the victim moans. Even Bernzy 
               is taken aback.

                                     BERNZY
                         Jesus.

               Not the thing a priest would say; he crosses himself to cover.

               Bernzy begins to mutter piously, indecipherably, over the 
               ailing man. He waves something over the man, like a bottle 
               of Holy Water when the last rites are administered.

               We see what he's waving: a light meter. Still muttering, 
               Bernzy reads the meter.

               The Attendant looks perplexed -- a dawning realization.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         ...Wait a second.

               From his oversized pocket, Bernzy withdraws a 35 mm camera. 
               He gets his shot fast, before the Attendant can react.

                                                              SHOCK CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               A Man in a hat watches as the ambulance comes to an abrupt 
               halt. The Man watches as The back doors open and a "priest" 
               spills out -- half leaping, half pushed. The "priest" lands 
               on his ass in the street (careful to protect his camera) as 
               the Attendant slams the ambulance doors.

               The ambulance takes off again.

               The "priest," unfazed, dusts himself off as he hails a cab 
               with a cheerful serious determination.

                                     BERNZY
                         Taxi!

               As the cab squeals away with the "priest", the Man in the 
               hat wonders what he just saw.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PHOTO DESK - DAILY MIRROR - NIGHT

               A photo editor, EDDY, studies the picture of the meat-cleaver 
               victim (we don't see it).

                                     EDDY
                         This is a new low, even for you, 
                         Bernzy.

                                     BERNZY
                         Flatter me all you want. It's still 
                         twenty dollars.

                                     EDDY
                         You got a release on this guy?

                                     BERNZY
                         You got a spirit medium on staff?

                                     EDDY
                         You checked with the hospital?

               Bernzy nods.

               Eddie opens the big ledger-style checkbook, starts to write 
               the check.

                                     BERNZY
                         Didn't even make it to Bellvue, poor 
                         bastard. Thank God I was able to 
                         administer his last rites.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ALL-NIGHT DRUGSTORE - NIGHT

               In black and white, overcranked, we watch a Sailor and his 
               Girl necking in the rear-booth of a drugstore.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         That's not very polite.

               At normal speed, in color, we see Bernzy, sitting at a booth 
               near the counter of the drugstore, staring at the young 
               couple. He has a cup of coffee, a plate of eggs and his camera 
               on the table.

               Bernzy, caught staring, looks up at the WOMAN.

                                     WOMAN
                         I know what it's like. I work nights 
                         myself.

               She takes a seat across from Bernzy.

               She has plain, well-scrubbed features, and wears a raincoat. 
               A Nurse and a Doctor are at the next booth.

                                     BERNZY
                         Professional interest...
                              (he puts the camera 
                              to his eye)
                         See?

                                     WOMAN
                              (ignoring this)
                         Break-time comes, there's nobody to 
                         talk to, you feel lonely, right?
                              (a beat)
                         How much you got on you?

               Bernzy looks at her a beat before picking up the camera again. 
               He shoots the Girl and the Sailor, rather than answer her.

                                     BERNZY
                         'Tomorrow He Sails' -- That's the 
                         caption.

                                     WOMAN
                         C'mon, how much? There's no harm in 
                         it.

                                     BERNZY
                         My wife wouldn't like it.

               Bernzy throws a dollar on the table, collects his camera: 
               he's in a hurry to get away. Meantime:

                                     WOMAN
                         Honey, you're not married and you 
                         don't have a girl: I saw how you 
                         were looking at those two.

               Bernzy gets up to go.

                                     WOMAN
                         Your socks don't even match.

               He pretends not to hear her, as he heads for the door. She 
               Calls after him, with a plaintive sweetness.

                                     WOMAN
                         Oh, c'mon -- come back!... It's lonely 
                         out there!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT./EXT. BERNZY'S SEDAN/STREET - NIGHT

               Bernzy drives, his gaze unflagging. The Dispatcher 
               monotonously intones a series of drab numbers on the hissing 
               radio.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BERNZY'S APARTMENT - DAY

               The police radio continues to hiss, O.S., without 
               interruption, as we pan Bernzy, asleep on top of his bed. 
               He's curled up in his clothes.

               Still panning, we see the apartment. It's exceedingly 
               cluttered -- as unkempt and eccentric as its occupant. The 
               shades are drawn against daylight.

               On the crowded table Bernzy uses for a desk, there is a 
               payroll check from Time, Inc.:

                               TWO MURDERS. . . . . .$35.00

               Pinned to the bulletin board over the desk, there are covers 
               from the New York Daily News, Mirror, World-Telegram, Post, 
               Sun and Journal-American, all featuring Bernzy's photos of 
               classic tabloid subjects: fires, corpses, handcuffed hoods.

               Piled against a wall are two four-foot-tall stacks of cigar 
               boxes with masking tape labels across their front flaps. 
               These are marked with laundry pencil: "Vagrants," "Drunks," 
               "Strippers," "Rich & Poor," "Coney Island," "Gangsters - 
               Dead," "Miscellaneous Crowds," "Bowery - Night," "Gangsters - 
               Live."

               Still panning, we see a series of photos clothes-pinned to a 
               laundry line. They show the Bum, sleeping in the box: he 
               seems isolated and diminished in the high contrast of the 
               Speed Graphic photo -- a bright island in a sea of blackness.

               Pulling back from the photo we see the photos of the curled 
               up bum in the foreground and Bernzy curled up on his bed in 
               the near distance, the police radio on his nightstand.

               We begin to hear Big Band music over the hissing as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CAFE SOCIETY - NIGHT

               We hear the Big Band music as we see a red awning lettered 
               LOU LEVITZ'S CAFE SOCIETY. It shows the club's trademark 
               since the 30's: a squat coffee cup (a remnant of Prohibition, 
               when gin was served in the guise of legal beverages).

               On the sidewalk outside the polished revolving doors, there 
               is a crush of out-of-towners who wait to enter, dressed in 
               their best. But they'll never be let in.

               A few Tabloid Photographers, behind a velvet rope, grip their 
               big cameras, waiting for celebrities to come or go. One of 
               them spots Bernzy as he threads his way through the crowd.

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
                         Hey, Bernzy, y'just missed Eleanor 
                         Roosevelt French-kissin' the Aga 
                         Kahn.

                                     BERNZY
                              (still moving)
                         I'll catch 'em inside.

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
                         That'll be the day.

               Bernzy approaches the beefy Irish doorman, in red livery, 
               who mans the ropes.

                                     DOORMAN
                         Behind the ropes, Bernstein.

               Bernzy parks his cigar in his mouth and extracts a piece of 
               paper from the inside pocket of his ill-fitting suit.

               The Doorman reads a handwritten note on Lou Levitz's personal 
               stationery. In a woman's hand: "Danny, Please direct Mr. 
               Bernstein to my office, Mrs. Levitz."

               As the Doorman reads, a patrician-looking Couple in evening 
               clothes push their way to the front.

                                     DOORMAN
                         Evening, Mister-missus Armstrong.

               The Doorman lifts the rope. Mr. Armstrong slips him a bill 
               as they pass through. Bernzy starts to follow, but the Doorman 
               hooks the rope before he can pass.

               He looks over at the other Photographers, as he hands Bernzy 
               back the note.

                                     DOORMAN
                         Kitchen door. Check the camera.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAFE SOCIETY - NIGHT

               The band music swells, O.S., as the kitchen door swings open 
               and a Waiter exits, tray in hand. It stays open as a Chinese 
               Bus Boy points Bernzy in the direction of the hat check, 
               across the front of the club.

               CAFE SOCIETY - HAT CHECK

               Bernzy, all eyes in this New York Mecca, takes up the claim 
               ticket for his camera, steps down into

               CAFE SOCIETY - MAIN ROOM

               The big band plays on a bandstand, raised and set back from 
               the tables. A black SINGER is performing, whose double 
               entendres and risque stage manner lend a cultivated air of 
               the illicit to things.

               In Cafe Society, as in The Stork Club or El Morocco, the 
               seating arrangements clearly denote the "importance" of 
               guests:

               The dreaded Outer Circle belongs to rich but garrulous 
               businessmen with flashy dates or wives in furs. The Middle 
               Circle is for show biz types, pretty women, professionals, 
               the up-and-coming. The coveted Inner Circles comprises the 
               well-born and the famous, e.g., Social Register types, stars 
               of Broadway, prize-fighters and movie stars.

               Every table has a white cloth, a red rose and a ceramic 
               ashtray that says LOU LEVITZ'S CAFE SOCIETY. Those who eat 
               eat steaks or chops. Everyone drinks champagne or Scotch. 
               Everyone smokes.

               Bernzy's eyes drink in the rich atmosphere. They seem to be 
               taking photographs without benefit of a camera: DOYENNE WITH 
               GIGOLO, FAT MAN OGLING CIGARETTE GIRL, ACTRESS IN SUNGLASSES, 
               etc., again through the black and white of Bernzy's trained 
               eye, overcranked.

               The MAITRE D' approaches Bernzy, intending to evict him; his 
               eyes scornfully size up Bernzy's clothes, his overall 
               demeanour. He has an Italian accent.

                                     MAITRE D'
                         You have reservations, sir?

                                     BERNZY
                         I can see you got some.

               The Italian looks at him, utterly perplexed by the idiom.

                                     BERNZY
                         Forget it.

               Bernzy shows him the note from Kay. Recovering from his gaffe, 
               the Maitre d' bows his head graciously. He crosses to a 
               section at the back of the room where The club's Hostess -- 
               a beauty -- is pointing out salient features of the room to 
               a delegation of men in business suits (not evening clothes.)

               She charms them all with some witty remark. As they laugh, 
               the Maitre d' points out Bernzy.

               She excuses herself, crosses to Bernzy. She looks impossibly 
               elegant next to him, or he looks impossibly unkempt next to 
               her.

                                     KAY
                         Thanks for coming, Mr. Bernstein.

                                     BERNZY
                         Bernzy.

               KAY (Mrs. Lou) LEVITZ is in her early 30's, a dancer/actress 
               plucked from some show or chorus by her husband years ago, 
               now groomed like a rich lady.

               Bernzy follows her toward a set of stairs at the back of the 
               club. As they move, she looks across at the men in suits.

                                     KAY

                         newsreel in here for War Bonds.

               INT. NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - SAME

               They enter. She closes the door behind them. The music is 
               still audible from downstairs, but muted.

               A professional Hostess, in full control of her charm, she 
               immediately crosses to a drinks caddy and pours him a Scotch.

                                     KAY
                         There's never been a camera inside. 
                         Lou always said "It's like Heaven, 
                         that way: they're dyin' to see it."

               Bernzy smiles, but he looks ill-at-ease, holding his hat.

               The back wall of the office has a big curtained window that 
               looks down on the nightclub. Memorabilia lines the other 
               walls.

               Bernzy is studying a photo-portrait of Kay -- a professional 
               glamour shot from her show business days. He looks at a framed 
               photo of Kay with the late Lou Levitz -- squat, bald, nattily 
               dressed.

               She hands him the Scotch and indicates the short couch.

                                     KAY
                         Please.

               He sits at one end. She sits at the other. The shabbiness of 
               his clothes is especially apparent in these sleek 
               surroundings. He's still uncomfortable. It shows.

                         Yeah, yeah: everybody already guessed 
                         what comes next.

                                     HAYWARD
                         The local police won't let anybody 
                         near 'em: no pictures, no interviews.

                                     BERNZY
                         I don't leave New York.

               They approach Bernzy's parking garage. A long line of cars 
               extends out into the street, waiting to enter. But Bernzy 
               and Hayward take no notice of it; it's business as usual.

               INT. GARAGE - SAME

               Now we see that the cars are queuing for gasoline. In the 
               filling station of the garage's ground floor, a posted sign 
               reads:

                            HAVE YOUR GAS RATION COUPONS READY

                                   (No Coupons, No Gas)

                                     HAYWARD
                         It's half an hour, over the bridge.
                              (hurrying to keep up)
                         There's gotta be 30 bucks in this 
                         for each of us if the wires pick it 
                         up. You telling me this thing's paid 
                         for already?

               He drags a finger through the dust atop Bernzy's sedan.

               As Bernzy thinks about it, Hayward pulls a silver whisky 
               flask from his jacket, unstops it, drinks.

                                     BERNZY
                         Alright. Call Greenport. Find out 
                         when the D.A.'s in court. Find out 
                         when the arresting officer's in the 
                         station house. In a two-bit town 
                         like this, he might even work the 
                         desk. When the cop's in and the D.A.'s 
                         out, gimme a call.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Thanks, Bernzy.

               Bernzy gets into the car.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Tell me where you're going dressed 
                         like that.

               Bernzy pulls the door shut without answering.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EASTSIDE OFFICE BLDG. - UPPER FLOOR CORRIDOR - DAY

               In a panelled hallway, Bernzy reads the name on an oak door 
               as he adjusts his tie. He goes in; we read the name on the 
               door:

                             H.R. RINEMAN & SONS, PUBLISHERS

               INT. ANTEROOM - RINEMAN PUBLISHING - SAME

               Bernzy gives his name to a RECEPTIONIST.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         Is it a pick-up or a delivery?

                                     BERNZY
                              (put out)
                         I have an appointment.

               The door to the inner offices and a sympathetic bespectacled 
               young man of 24, RICHARD RINEMAN, comes out, pulling into a 
               coat.

               Bernzy approaches him, smiling.

                                     YOUNG RINEMAN
                              (flustered)
                         Mr. Bernstein. How are you. It's my 
                         father who'll see you today. I've a 
                         doctor's appointment, I'm afraid.

               Bernzy already suspects something is amiss, but hides it.

                                     BERNZY
                         Sure, that's all right.

                                     YOUNG RINEMAN
                              (smiling awkwardly)
                         Well, then -- goodbye.

               He goes out. Bernzy seems to know the same door is going to 
               open again.

               It does. H.R. RINEMAN appears, an athletically vigorous 60 
               year old.

                                     RINEMAN
                         Mr. Bernstein?

               INT. RINEMAN'S OFFICE - LATER

               Rineman leads Bernzy into his book-lined office: all dark 
               wood and rich leather.

                                     RINEMAN
                         Now does one call you Mr. Bernstein 
                         or Mr. Bernzini? Or is it just 
                         Bernzini?

                                     BERNZY
                         I was born Leon Bernstein. But I got 
                         the name 'The Great Bernzini' from 
                         the gals at World-wide, the big photo 
                         agency? They said I had t'be a 
                         magician to get to so many disasters 
                         so fast.

                                     RINEMAN
                         That's marvelous.

               He shows Bernzy to a chair in front of his desk, speaking as 
               he takes his own seat, behind it.

                                     RINEMAN
                         I know my son spoke to you 
                         optimistically about publishing your 
                         book. That's why he wanted me -- why 
                         I wanted to speak to you rather than 
                         tossing it back into the mail.

               Bernzy's eyes narrow almost imperceptibly but with a kind of 
               anger: he's suffered this particular humiliation before.

               Bernzy's book is on Rineman's desk. It's a "dummy book" -- a 
               manuscript made up of stiff pieces of paper onto which 
               photographs, printed on good paper, have been glued, along 
               with captions.

               The book lies open to a photograph of a black man with an 
               agonized expression, a fire-truck behind him, his face lighted 
               by the unseen flames of his tenement afire.

                                     RINEMAN
                         Of course, from a technical point of 
                         view, this is fine work, fine work. 
                         It's simply that we don't publish 
                         books of this type.

                                     BERNZY
                         Listen, Mr. Rineman, please don't 
                         hand me that -- please -- 'cause 
                         everybody knows Rineman & Sons 
                         publishes more photograph books than 
                         anybody else.

                                     RINEMAN
                              (ever gracious)
                         Well, sir, we publish books of 
                         photography. And to my mind, this is 
                         instead a most admirable picture 
                         book about New York. Not an inferior 
                         genre, just different.

                                     BERNZY
                         No. You're wrong. This is a book of 
                         photography.

                                     RINEMAN
                         If I may explain --

                                     BERNZY
                         I know what you mean. Still lifes, 
                         naked women gettin' out of bath-tubs, 
                         fruit on a plate -- it's a photo, 
                         but let's pretend it's a painting.

               We now see a row of tasteful framed photos on the wall behind 
               Rineman, in precisely the style Bernzy describes. They include 
               a woman getting out of her bath and fruit on a plate.

                                     BERNZY
                         I know how to do that, too. I really 
                         do. But let's face it, you publish 
                         enough of them books already. 
                         Everybody does. C'mon, Mr. Rineman: 
                         show those other guys. This is the 
                         book.

               Bernzy winks.

               Rineman is appalled by Bernzy's boastfulness, but hides it.

                                     RINEMAN
                         May I say you're not being fair to 
                         the photographers we do publish -- 
                         Dick Arlen, Harold Briley, Val 
                         Armbruster.

                                     BERNZY
                         I'm sure they're nice guys, but those 
                         arty-farty shots are easy to get 
                         compared to something like this
                              (he leans over, points 
                              to the open book, 
                              feature by feature)
                         -- where you got a big shiny fire 
                         truck in front of you, and a whole 
                         building on fire behind you, so the 
                         light's every which way, and mean-
                         time, this poor son-of-a-bitch is 
                         watching his life go up --

                                     RINEMAN
                         Really, I don't doubt the difficulties 
                         you must've faced... You're 
                         technically superb.

                                     BERNZY
                         Right.

                                     RINEMAN
                              (hiding his distaste 
                              again)
                         But what I see here is a batch of 
                         pictures that's too -- sensational 
                         and too -- vulgar to justify printing 
                         a fine book of photography, which is 
                         an expensive thing to do.

                                     BERNZY
                         What's vulgar, exactly? This guy? or 
                         the fire?

                                     RINEMAN
                         Since you obviously have great talent, 
                         I'd like to suggest that you apply 
                         it to a subject matter that --

                                     BERNZY
                         No -- huh-nh, no.

                                     RINEMAN
                              (finally letting his 
                              impatience show)
                         Please listen, Mr. Bernstein -- !

                                     BERNZY
                         Don't you think I heard this advice 
                         before? I just happen to be right 
                         about all this, see? Don't you think 
                         I'd rather be shooting flowers or 
                         beautiful dames than campin' out 
                         with corpses?

                                     RINEMAN
                         Maybe you should ask yourself. 
                         Sensationalism has its allure. It's 
                         potent. It can desensitize a man to 
                         the beauty of flowers -- or women.

                                     BERNZY
                         What're you, a shrink?

                                     RINEMAN
                         Hardly. But the men who do what you 
                         do don't usually feel the need to 
                         rationalize it like you -- much less 
                         be celebrated for it.

                                     BERNZY
                         Nobody does what I do.

               Bernzy takes up the book as Rineman watches.

               He moves to the door, seizes the knob, but pauses.

                                     BERNZY
                         I figure your boy really did wanna 
                         publish my book. Tell him I won't 
                         hold this against him when I have my 
                         big retrospective over at the modern 
                         art museum.

                                     RINEMAN
                              (his interest piqued, 
                              now)
                         You're having a show at the Museum 
                         of Modern Art?

                                     BERNZY
                         Someday.

                                     RINEMAN
                              (a thin smile)
                         Oh...
                              (his certitude restored)
                         If you really disdain the publishing 
                         establishment so, why do you crave 
                         its acceptance?

                                     BERNZY
                         Who the hell else is gonna publish a 
                         book?

               He slams the door behind him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

               A door opens and a dozen flashbulbs blaze as a young HOOD, 
               handcuffed to a Cop, enters the room.

               However, the Hood is covering his face with his unchained 
               hand, so nobody gets a shot. Several Photographers, Bernzy 
               not among them, are clustered at the door.

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER 1
                         Give us a shot, son!

                                     COP
                         Clear the way!

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER 2
                         C'mon, one picture!

               The Hood, his face still shielded, kicks blindly in front of 
               him, clearing the way. He is led toward the booking post.

               BERNZY, meantime, is perched on a Sergeant's desk, as the 
               Sergeant reads over a file. Bernzy watches the commotion 
               with the young Hood with interest but no urgency.

                                     SERGEANT
                         There's two guys called Portifino 
                         with records. But nobody that age or 
                         description.

                                     BERNZY
                         No record.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Not in New York, anyway.

                                     BERNZY
                              (baffled)
                         Hm. Maybe he is Society League.

               As Bernzy gets up, he gives a few cigars to the Sergeant.

                                     BERNZY
                         I gotta go take this kid's picture.

               The Sergeant scoops the cigars into his desk drawer. He looks 
               over at the snarling, defiant Hood.

                                     SERGEANT
                         I don't think he wants it took.

                                     BERNZY
                              (taking up his camera)
                         Everybody likes to have his picture 
                         took.

               Bernzy approaches the Hood, whose handcuffs have been removed 
               so that he may be fingerprinted. He still covers his face.

                                     BERNZY
                         Listen, kid.

                                     HOOD
                         Fuck off.

                                     COP
                              (to the Hood)
                         Can you write?

               The Hood nods.

                                     COP
                         Sign this.

               The Hood takes the pen and signs the form, still careful to 
               keep his face concealed.

                                     BERNZY
                         You ever heard of The Great Bernzini? 
                         I shot Dutch Schultz, Legs Diamond -- 
                         these guys never covered their face 
                         from me.

                                     HOOD
                         I said fuck off.

                                     BERNZY
                         I get everybody's picture, while 
                         he's alive or after... I ain't met 
                         the guy yet looks better after.

                                     HOOD
                              (after a beat)
                         You that freak, drives around in a 
                         sedan all night?

                                     BERNZY
                         That's me.

                                     HOOD
                         I heard about you.

                                     BERNZY
                         In your line of work, I'm the 
                         photographer to the stars.

                                     HOOD
                         Yeah, yeah, I heard of you. Them 
                         other creeps around?

               Bernzy looks over to make sure the other Photographers have 
               given up.

                                     BERNZY
                         They're over there, smoking.

               The Hood uncovers his face. The police have worked him over. 
               He has a mean cut under one eye. He gives Bernzy his fiercest, 
               most defiant post.

               Bernzy squeezes the shutter.

               When the flash fires, all the other Photographers look over 
               quickly.

               But the Hood has covered his face, again.

                                     BERNZY
                         Thanks.

                                     HOOD
                         Fuck off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. EAST SIDE - NIGHT

               In his parked car, Bernzy reads Portifino's gilt business 
               card under the dashboard light, then looks out at Portifino's 
               residence:

               A high-priced building with a Moderne facade and a Doorman.

               Bernzy gets out, tosses his cigar away, stows his camera in 
               the trunk, crosses and enters.

               INT. BUILDING LOBBY - SAME

               We watch from outside the glass as Bernzy speaks to the 
               Doorman, bribes him, is directed to the elevator.

               INT. HALLWAY - SAME

               Bernzy comes off the elevator, heads down the hallway to APT 
               7G. The door is barely ajar; a sliver of light falls through 
               the crack, onto the hallway carpet.

               Bernzy rings the bell. No response. He rings again. Waiting 
               he glances downward casually --

                                     BERNZY
                         Whoops.

               A shimmering dark ribbon of blood seeps under the doorway.

               Bernzy pushes the door open a few inches before it hits 
               something solid. He forces the door another few inches, and 
               pulls himself through the opening.

               INT. PORTIFINO'S APT. - SAME

               The luxury apartment has a few pieces of furniture and some 
               unopened boxes in it; Portifino has just moved in.

               But it is Porfitino who lies dead by the door.

               He is tangled in piano wire. The wire was rigged around the 
               still-living Portifino so that any movement caused it to dig 
               more deeply into him. He killed himself by dragging himself 
               to the door to seek help.

               Bernzy goes to the telephone, dials a number.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Precinct.

                                     BERNZY
                         Homicide, please.

               beat. Then a voice:

                                     CONKLIN (O.S.)
                         Homicide. Conklin.

                                     BERNZY
                         Hey, Conklin, it's Bernzy.

                                     CONKLIN (O.S.)
                         What's up, Bernzy?

                                     BERNZY
                         I was paying kind of a social call 
                         on a guy called Emilio Portifino.

               There is an odd silence on Conklin's end -- and then an edge 
               to his voice.

                                     CONKLIN (O.S.)
                         Yes?

                                     BERNZY
                         The guy's been murdered. I'm standin' 
                         here in his apartment now.
                              (he glances at the 
                              corpse)
                         Professional job. I never saw anything 
                         like it.

                                     CONKLIN (O.S.)
                         Alright, stay where you are.

                                     BERNZY
                         I gotta leave for a few minutes.

                                     CONKLIN (O.S.)
                         What?

                                     BERNZY
                         Just downstairs, to get my camera.
                              (he looks at the corpse)
                         This is somethin' you don't see alot.

                                     CONKLIN (O.S.)
                         No. Stay put! We'll be there in five 
                         minutes.

                                     BERNZY
                         Alright. The address is one-fifteen --

               But the phone clicks off. Bernzy sets down the receiver. He 
               looks at the corpse.

                                     BERNZY
                         He knew your address already.

               He picks up the phone, dials another number.

                                     BERNZY
                         Kay Levitz, please...

                                     PHONE VOICE (O.S.)
                         Who's calling?

                                     BERNZY
                         Leon Bernstein -- Bernzy.

                                                               INTERCUT TO:

               INT. CAFE SOCIETY - NIGHT

               A Waiter plugs in a telephone by a table where Kay chats and 
               laughs with some Society Types. He hands her the telephone.

                                                               INTERCUT TO:

               INT. PORTIFINO'S APT.

               Bernzy looks at the corpse as he speaks on the phone.

                                     BERNZY
                         You're not gonna have no more trouble 
                         with Portifino in the good seats.

               INT. CAFE SOCIETY

               Kay is stunned as the other people at the table laugh gayly, 
               obliviously, around her.

                                     KAY
                         He's was what?... My God.

               Hearing her, one of the Men at the table looks at her. She 
               forces a smile.

               INT. PORTIFINO'S APT.

               Bernzy looks at his watch.

                                     BERNZY
                         Anything you better tell me? Anything 
                         I better know before the cops get 
                         here?

               INT. CAFE SOCIETY

               At the table, the Man smiles at Kay, again. She smiles back 
               only fleetingly, before shifting in her seat, so she can 
               speak more privately into the phone.

                                     KAY
                         Bernzy, all I know about him is what 
                         I told you. If you're asking what I 
                         think you are --

                                     BERNZY (O.S.)
                         I'm not askin' that...

               INT. PORTIFINO'S APT.

                                     BERNZY
                         The Mob did this guy in, it's obvious.

               INT. CAFE SOCIETY

                                     KAY
                              (weak, as if from a 
                              blow)
                         The Mob.

               INT. PORTIFINO'S APARTMENT

               Bernzy can hear how upset she is. He wants to say something 
               comforting, but he wants to get his picture. He looks at 
               Portifino.

                                     BERNZY
                         Yeah. Alright, look, I -- I'll be in 
                         touch. I gotta go.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PORTIFINO'S BLDG. - 7TH FLR HALLWAY - LATER

               CONKLIN, in a suit, comes swiftly off the elevator, with two 
               Uniformed Cops and a Man in a gray suit and hat behind him.

               INT. PORTIFINO'S APT. - SAME

               Bernzy, having ignored Conklin's request, stands over the 
               corpse, taking a picture. He smokes a cigar.

               Conklin and the others burst in. Conklin leads the man in 
               the suit to Bernzy as the others set to work, dusting for 
               finger-prints, etc.

                                     BERNZY
                              (taking another picture)
                         Conklin.

                              (to the man in the 
                              suit)
                         Mr. Chadwick, this is Leon Bernstein, 
                         commonly known as The Great Bernzini. 
                         Bernzy, this is Inspector Chadwick 
                         of the Federal Bureau of 
                         Investigation.

               Surprised, Bernzy looks over from his viewfinder.

                                     BERNZY
                         Pleased to meet you.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FEDERAL BLDG. (CHURCH ST.) - NIGHT

               Low angle: Tires squeal as an unmarked sedan pulls up to the 
               curb.

               Bernzy is quickly and closely escorted from the car, up the 
               stairs, like a star witness or a criminal in custody. He 
               raises his eyebrows wryly, wonders what the hell is going 
               on...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FBI - CHADWICK'S OFFICE - LATER

               Bernzy is in front of the desk in Chadwick's clean, non-
               descript office. One one side of him, a Young Agent takes 
               notes; on the other side of him an Older Agent (gray-haired) 
               says nothing, merely observes.

               Chadwick stands behind his desk, in front of two steel filing 
               cabinets. He interrogates Bernzy in the humorless G-Man style.

                                     CHADWICK
                         What was your business with Portifino?

                                     BERNZY
                         I told you. I was just calling on 
                         him as a favor to a friend.

                                     CHADWICK
                         Right. What did you say your friend's 
                         name was?

                                     BERNZY
                         I didn't say.

               Chadwick waits a beat: Bernzy offers nothing.

                                     BERNZY
                         What're you investigating here, 
                         anyway? I mean, what was this guy --

                                     CHADWICK
                         Did your friend have business dealings 
                         with Portifino.

                                     BERNZY
                         No.

                                     CHADWICK
                         Detective Conklin tells us you know 
                         many members of the mob in New York.

                                     BERNZY
                         I also know a lot of cops and wash-
                         room attendants. It's the only way a 
                         photographer stays in business. I 
                         mean a tabloid photographer, not a 
                         Steiglitz or a Steichen.

                                     YOUNG AGENT
                              (for his notes)
                         Excuse me. Steigle or -- ?

                                     BERNZY
                         The second and third best 
                         photographers in the country.

               Nobody asks who's first.

                                     CHADWICK
                         Don't mobsters sometimes say they 
                         won't let anybody but you take their 
                         picture?

                                     BERNZY
                         That's right. I'm sure you get t'know 
                         a lot of criminals in your line of 
                         work, too.

               Chadwick, impervious to humor, stares.

                                     BERNZY
                         Maybe not.

                                     CHADWICK
                         Was Portifino with the mob?

                                     BERNZY
                         I dunno... Was he?

                                     CHADWICK
                         I ask the questions here... How did 
                         he do it? How did he come to town 
                         and set himself up so fast?

                                     BERNZY
                         Look, you know more about this guy 
                         than I do, that's obvious. I call 
                         Conklin, right away you guys know 
                         the address, now you're tellin' me 
                         he's in business --

               Chadwick brings his fists down hard onto the desk, rattling 
               the lamps, ashtray and desk-set.

                                     CHADWICK
                         Tell us how Portifino made his money!

                                     BERNZY
                         I don't know anything. I see the guy 
                         once for five seconds, next time I 
                         see him he's dead.
                              (he looks around)
                         I have to get to work now.

                                     CHADWICK
                         Oh? You have a job?

                                     BERNZY
                              (wearily, patiently)
                         I'm a free-lance photographer. If 
                         I'm not on the street at midnight, 
                         the world passes me by.

                                     CHADWICK
                         Tough way to make a living... You 
                         were hoping to get money from 
                         Portifino, is that right?

                                     BERNZY
                         What?

                                     CHADWICK
                         You intended to blackmail him.

                                     BERNZY
                         This is a joke.
                              (he looks to the others)
                         It's a gag, right?

                                     CHADWICK
                         Mr. Bernstein, you came to this 
                         country from Russia when you were 
                         six years old.

                                     BERNZY
                              (getting up, putting 
                              on his hat)
                         Alright, that's it. I got my cell 
                         meeting in half an hour.

               He reaches for his exposed film plates on the desk. But 
               Chadwick traps his hand there.

                                     CHADWICK
                         Where you going? How d'you know you're 
                         not a suspect in the murder of Emilio 
                         Portifino?

                                     BERNZY
                         This is the stupidest interrogation 
                         I've ever seen. You're telling me 
                         more than I'm telling you. Already I 
                         know this guy got rich quick doing 
                         something the Feds don't like. Already 
                         I can see you're tryin' to keep it 
                         quiet, and when you bring up Russia, 
                         I figure it's something treasonous.

               Chadwick begins to speak, but the Older Agent -- alarmed by 
               Bernzy's perspicacity -- takes over.

                                     OLDER AGENT
                         Mr. Bernstein, thanks for your 
                         cooperation. We're sorry if we've 
                         taken you away from your work. This 
                         is a time of war, and we hope you'll 
                         keep your conjectures about Mr. 
                         Portifino to yourself. Fact is, we 
                         know nothing about the man, and hoped 
                         perhaps you did.

               Bernzy doesn't believe the last part, but keeps it to himself.

                                     BERNZY
                         Yeah, okay. So if I could just get 
                         my film plates back...

                                     OLDER AGENT
                         We can't give them to you. Not for a 
                         few days.

                                     BERNZY
                         He's news tonight. I won't be able 
                         to sell 'em in a few days.

                                     OLDER AGENT
                         Stop back here at Inspector Chadwick's 
                         office in the morning. He'll give 
                         you the proper forms to fill in.

               Bernzy looks from face to face, seeing he has no choice in 
               the matter.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FEDERAL BUILDING - NIGHT

               Bernzy comes down the stairs of the F.B.I. building and begins 
               walking, camera in hand.

               Across the street, a car starts up as Bernzy heads up the 
               block. It begins to follow him, keeping a discreet distance.

               Bernzy turns off the avenue, onto the sidestreet. The car 
               makes the turn too.

               EXT. SIDESTREET

               As Bernzy moves along the dark sidewalk, he realizes the car 
               is following him. He picks up his pace, but the car follows 
               suit. Almost reflexively he begins to load a film plate into 
               his camera, but the car accelerates, and overtakes him on 
               the sidewalk. Two MEN get out -- thick-featured and thuggish -- 
               while a third Man stays behind the wheel.

               The Men close in around Bernzy. Each takes one of his arms. 
               The camera falls to the ground; the lens shatters. They drag 
               Bernzy gruffly into the car.

                                     BERNZY
                         You boys work for Farinelli, right?
                              (recognizing one of 
                              them)
                         It's Tonio, right?

               Bernzy's attempt at affability is futile: grimly serious, 
               they push him into the car.

                                     BERNZY
                              (as he's stuffed into 
                              the seat)
                         At least pick up the damn camera!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               The same car pulls up and parks.

               As one of the Thugs pulls Bernzy out, Bernzy reaches back to 
               pick up his smashed camera.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FARINELLI'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               The panelled office might belong to a well-off insurance 
               agent with a weakness for ugly nick-nacks.

               Farinelli rises to his feet as Bernzy is pushed into the 
               room. He is an overweight, mid-level capo of 55. Two of his 
               lieutenants are sitting on a couch.

                                     FARINELLI
                              (to his goons)
                         What're you pushin' him around for? 
                         We know this guy.
                              (he shakes his head)
                         Have a seat, Bernzy. Want a drink?

                                     BERNZY
                         You got coffee?

               He gestures to one of the Hoods to fetch coffee.

                                     FARINELLI
                         You know Mikey and Sal?

               The two lieutenants nod from the couch. SAL is lean, with a 
               particularly arresting face (we will see him again).

                                     LIEUTENANTS
                         Hiya, Bernzy/Bernzy.

                                     FARINELLI
                         Bernzy, you found the body of this 
                         punk Portifino, right?

               Bernzy nods.

                                     FARINELLI
                         So what d'you know about him?

                                     BERNZY
                         Nothing, really.

                                     FARINELLI
                         'Nothin.' Then why'd you call the 
                         Feds?

                                     BERNZY
                         I didn't.

                                     FARINELLI
                         You didn't.

                                     BERNZY
                         I found the body. Not the first I 
                         ever found. I called the cops, like 
                         I always do. They called the F.B.I.

               Annoyed, Farinelli turns to his lieutenants, speaks in 
               Italian. After a brief tirade, he turns back to Bernzy.

                                     FARINELLI
                         Okay, so you didn't call the Feds, 
                         we was misinformed by a police stooge. 
                         I'd still like to know how you knew 
                         Portifino.

                                     BERNZY
                         I didn't. Not really.

               The Hood returns with coffee from someplace outside. But 
               Farinelli, annoyed by now, directs him to put it on a side 
               table (instead of giving it to Bernzy).

                                     FARINELLI
                         You didn't, not really... Then what 
                         were you doin' in his apartment, if 
                         I may ask?

               Bernzy studies Farinelli a beat before answering. He can see 
               how agitated Farinelli is about all of this.

                                     BERNZY
                         I met him the other night. At Cafe 
                         Society. He said he needed somebody 
                         to take his picture. He offered good 
                         money.

                                     FARINELLI
                         You don't do commissions. I offered 
                         you plenty when my sister's boy took 
                         communion two years ago.

               Close on Bernzy, caught in a lie.

                                     BERNZY
                         That's right, I don't. Do commissions. 
                         But I got a nose for news. Talkin' 
                         to this kid, it smelled like there 
                         might be somethin' in it.

                                     FARINELLI
                              (getting up)
                         Oh! So that's all there is to it?

               Bernzy nods; he watches as Farinelli moves next to his seat, 
               looms over him, smiling. But his face turns fierce as 
               Farinelli kicks the chair out from under Bernzy, who flops 
               onto his back and hits his head on the tiles.

               Bernzy lies on the floor, more stunned and humiliated than 
               hurt, and looks up at the half-circle formed around him by 
               Farinelli and his thugs.

               Bernzy stares up at Farinelli. He raises his right hand to 
               God.

               After a long beat, Farinelli extends his hand, to help him 
               up.

                                     FARINELLI
                         Okay, Bernzy. As it is, I gotta trust 
                         you. You never crossed nobody, got 
                         no interest in dough, do nothin' but 
                         take pictures, noon and night.

               He circles his arm around Bernzy, and walks him to the door.

                                     FARINELLI
                         What is it with you, anyway? Dope 
                         fiends live better than you do. You're 
                         a fuckin' freak, you know that?

                                     BERNZY
                         Yeah, well, like the guy who shoveled 
                         the elephant shit said to the circus 
                         owner, 'What? And give up Show 
                         Business?'.

               Farinelli laughs but grips Bernzy a little too tightly.

                                     FARINELLI
                         Don't go around talkin' about this 
                         dead little fuck, awright?

               We begin to hear lively music play, anticipating the

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CAFE SOCIETY - NIGHT

               The usual crowd is gathered by the ropes. The other 
               Photographers watch sullenly as the rope is raised for Bernzy.

               INT. CAFE SOCIETY - SAME

               Bernzy is looking upward, toward the windowed office as he 
               crosses the club. He is therefore taken unawares when a Man 
               at a good table catches him by the sleeve --

                                     MAN
                         Surprised they let you in here, 
                         Bernstein. I'll complain to the 
                         management.

               Bernzy sees ARTHUR NABLER, a likable man, 57-years-old, 
               overweight, seemingly unaccustomed to the dinner clothes 
               he's wearing. At the moment, he's drunk.

               A Woman is with him at the table, much younger than he is, 
               attractive in flashy way.

                                     NABLER
                         Siddown, c'mon, sit!

               Bernzy glances up at the office again --

                                     BERNZY
                         Half a minute.

                                     NABLER
                         Don't be a pill! How else you ever 
                         gonna sit right here... 'Hack makes 
                         good,' eh Bernzy? Meet Vera Hixon. 
                         Vera, this guy's the best shutterbug 
                         in New York.
                              (to Bernzy)
                         You seen my show?

                                     BERNZY
                         It's on my calendar. 'Brooklyn 
                         Rhapsody,' Winter Garden Theatre. 
                         But I work nights.

                                     VERA
                         It's a beautiful show.

               She squeezes Nabler's arm in her hands and rubs her cheek 
               against his shoulder.

                                     NABLER
                         I know what you think: why should I 
                         go see a bunch of Arty's old columns 
                         dramatized when I already read 'em.

               Nabler drains his Scotch.

                                     BERNZY
                         Untrue... I never read 'em.

               But Nabler's mood is turning sour as his high winds down. He 
               can't seem to find a Waiter to bring him a new Scotch.

                                     NABLER
                         Waiter!
                              (getting no response)
                         I'm dyin' here... I'm 57 years old. 
                         You think she'd've looked at me six 
                         months ago?

                                     BERNZY
                         C'mon, Nabler.

                                     NABLER
                         Best shutterbug in New York. You 
                         know what that means? It means his 
                         pictures are catching birdshit at 
                         the bottom of the cage six hours 
                         after the papers come out. Just like 
                         my columns used to do.

               Nabler tries to attract the Waiter, again, but seeing what's 
               happening, Vera tries to ease the glass out of his hand.

                                     VERA
                         Arty -- ?

               He pulls the glass away from her.

                                     NABLER
                         At least if you write books or paint 
                         pictures they say, Alright, he had 
                         no money, no life, not even a steady 
                         girl, but look what he painted, look 
                         what he wrote. (he answers his own 
                         question) She wouldn't of pissed on 
                         me, six months ago.

                                     VERA
                              (rising, upset)
                         Excuse me --

                                     BERNZY
                              (half rising, politely)
                         Miss Hixon.
                              (to Nabler, when she's 
                              gone)
                         Arthur, I think you better apologize 
                         to the lady.

               Bernzy gets up, but Nabler grabs his hand.

                                     NABLER
                         You're giving me advice about my 
                         love life?!

               Eager to escape, Bernzy tries to wrest his hand away. But 
               Nabler clings to it: he's as deadly earnest as a dying man.

                                     NABLER
                         Listen to me, Bernzy, listen to one 
                         who knows: Nobody could love you. No 
                         woman could ever love a shabby little 
                         guy who sleeps in his clothes and 
                         eats outta cans and cozies up to 
                         corpses so much he starts to stink 
                         like one.

               Bernzy, sucker-punched, attempts to remove his hand.

                                     BERNZY
                         Arty, you better get a refund from 
                         that charm school --

                                     NABLER
                              (he won't relinquish 
                              Bernzy's hand)
                         And for what? Drunks and stiffs --

                                     BERNZY
                         Y'mind? -- I got a bird in the oven --

               Bernzy pulls his hand away, but Nabler is not in control, 
               blubbering and shouting, melancholy and drunk.

                                     NABLER
                         -- thugs and bums and whores and 
                         creeps --

               He draws attention: it sounds like he's shouting epithets.

               We move with Bernzy, who is stoical and swift, past the 
               glittering crowd. Nabler is blubbering and shouting under 
               the music but Bernzy isn't hearing him.

               We see what he sees, but this time it's in color -- it's 
               life, untransmogrified:

               Men and women laughing, drinking champagne, eating steaks, 
               hands held across tables, words whispered into lovers' ears, 
               the music smooth and gay. The music rises.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KAY'S OFFICE - LATER

               It's suddenly quiet. The band is on its break.

               Bernzy staring out the window, sees into the club where Nabler 
               is trying to get Vera to sit down with him again, but she 
               pulls away, stalks out.

                         called the police -- two hours ago.

               He looks at her -- annoyed.

                                     BERNZY
                         What'd y'do that for?

               Obviously, she meant well. He softens.

                         people, I can't. Y'see what happens?

                         you give me a drink, it's beautiful 
                         up here, I'm feelin' good about myself --

                         on some gangster's floor.

               They look at each other.

               She goes to get a cigarette by the desk. He looks down into 
               the club, sees Nabler, then asks --

                         -- A little parasite, preyin' on 
                         people's misery. You're not the only 
                         one knows what people say about you...

                                     KAY
                         It doesn't matter what they say about 
                         you, Bernzy. Not unless you believe 
                         'em.

               He looks at her. Her words seem to get to him, or maybe just 
               she does.

               He looks away, down into the club again. He watches NABLER, 
               as struggles to his feet, throws money on the table, and 
               staggers away.

                                     BERNZY
                         It's not over because Portifino's 
                         dead. Somebody else is gonna come in 
                         and tell you he's Lou's partner.

               By the desk, holding a cigarette, she speaks quietly.

                                     KAY
                         I figured.

               She takes a seat on the desk, as if for support.

                                     BERNZY
                         I think Lou was involved in somethin' 
                         bad... Evil.

               She nods, determined to be strong, determined not to be 
               emotional, although she knows she's in trouble.

               He looks back into the window.

                                     BERNZY
                         I could prob'ly find out what it is. 
                         I could do that.

               He sees her reflection in the window. She stares off 
               somewhere, trying not to cry.

                                     KAY
                              (quietly)
                         You don't have to.

               Bernzy is staring at her reflection. He sees himself, too: 
               the ill-fitting suit, the ludicrous pockets.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               In black and white, we see a stretch of walkway by the East 
               River, thick with couples who stroll and kiss.

               Bernzy drives by slowly, watches keenly, afflicted by the 
               strong feelings Kay has stirred up in him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FEDERAL BLDG. - CHURCH STREET - DAWN

               The building to which Bernzy was brought for interrogation.

               INT. FEDERAL BLDG. - LOBBY - SAME

               In the overscaled marble lobby, Bernzy pleads his case to a 
               uniformed Watchman.

                                     BERNZY
                         He's gone? He promised he'd give me 
                         back my plates this morning.

                                     WATCHMAN
                         Then why don't you come back when it 
                         really is morning?

                                     BERNZY
                         It's morning at the Daily Mirror. 
                         It's morning at the Post. I gotta 
                         make a living, just like you.

                                     WATCHMAN
                         Sit over there while I phone somebody.

               The Watchman gestures to a marble bench by the elevator 
               alcove.

               He himself goes to the marble reception desk, to make the 
               call.

               As the guard dials, Bernzy walks straight past the bench, 
               into the elevator. The doors close behind him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. 4TH FLOOR HALLWAY (FBI) - SAME

               Bernzy comes off the elevator, onto a long hall with offices 
               on either side. Some doors are open; we can hear the vacuum 
               cleaner of a janitor.

               Bernzy comes quickly down to the hallway, to the office at 
               the head of it -- Chadwick's. A pail and mop stand outside, 
               but when Bernzy peeks into the open door, the office is empty. 
               He enters.

               INT. CHADWICK'S OFFICE

               Bernzy hurries behind the desk, to a steel filing cabinet, 
               one of two. It is locked. He studies the lock. His only light 
               comes from the hallway, through the frosted glass. He jiggles 
               the lock. It won't budge. He searches for the key in the 
               desk drawers. Can't find it.

               He looks at the other filing cabinet. It has no lock, but is 
               marked "UNCLASSIFIED MATERIAL." This seems less than promising 
               but Bernzy unrolls the top drawer, anyway.

               He takes out his cigarette lighter, strikes the flame. It 
               throws a wavering flame over the file tabs. He finds the one 
               he WANTS: "PORTIFINO, EMILIO."

                                                               INTERCUT TO:

               INT. FEDERAL BUILDING - LOBBY - SAME

               Chadwick charges in.

                                     CHADWICK
                         Where is he?

               The Watchman, who by now has two other Uniformed Guards with 
               him, points to the clock-style indicator on one of the 
               elevators: 4TH FLOOR.

               They all get into the available elevator.

                                                               INTERCUT TO:

               INT. CHADWICK'S OFFICE

               Bernzy opens the file. We read it with him. The pages are 
               attached to a manila folder from the top, like a medical 
               file:

                                    PORTIFINO, EMILIO

                                     Deceased 6/3/42

               ALL FILES EXPUNGED, TRANSFERRED TO WASHINGTON, D.C. 6/3/42.

                                     BERNZY
                         Damn.

               In frustration, he turns the page, to see if there's more. 
               There is a second page, on which all the print is blacked 
               out. A third page is likewise obliterated.

               INT. 4TH FLOOR HALLWAY

               Chadwick and the three Guards come hurriedly off the elevator.

               INT. CHADWICK'S OFFICE

               As the footsteps of Chadwick et. al. echo down the hallway, 
               Bernzy pages past several more blacked-out pages, before 
               coming to the last page, on which a single sentence remains:

                    SEE ALSO "CL(assified) FILE #42784 -- "BLACK GAS"

               The waving lighter flame excites a sense of evil as we come 
               close to these sinister sounding words -- "BLACK GAS."

               Bernzy knits his brow -- but has no time to wonder: the 
               silhouettes of Chadwick et. al. are on the frosted glass.

               As he digs into the file cabinet to re-insert the goods, we 
               watch the silhouettes growing nearer and nearer on the glass.

               Bernzy rolls shut the drawer just as the door swings open, 
               plops himself into Chadwick's chair, puts his feet on the 
               desk (a more insolent, but less incriminating pose).

                                     CHADWICK
                         What is this?

                                     BERNZY
                         I'm not leaving till I get back my 
                         plates.

               Chadwick looks at Bernzy suspiciously. He plunges his hand 
               into his pants pocket, extracts a ring of keys, moves swiftly 
               to the locked file cabinet, opens it.

               He pulls out Bernzy's plates (in a pouch), spreads them on 
               the desk, counts them. Then he puts them back in the pouch, 
               back in the file, and locks it.

               He turns back to Bernzy, seething.

                                     WATCHMAN
                         Should I call the cops, Inspector?

               Chadwick is thinking about it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PARKING GARAGE - DAWN

               OPEN CLOSE on a poster which shows G.I. Joe -- his weary 
               face smudged black with battle. The enemy advances from a 
               distant hill. Joe stands beside his jeep with a gas can -- 
               but only a last drop of fuel is left.

               "DO YOUR PART! SAVE A GALLON FOR G.I. JOE!" proclaims the 
               poster's bold slogan. Then, in lesser letters: "Rationing 
               Saves American Lives."

               Bernzy stands in his underground parking garage, studying 
               the poster, his brow knitted.

               By the concrete wall beyond the pumps, a teenage grease-monkey 
               reads a "Shadow" pulp on a folding chair.

                                     BERNZY
                         You got any Black Gas, Freddy?

                              (guessing)
                         Black -- I dunno -- black market 
                         gas.

                                     BERNZY
                         Oh yeah?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STAIRWELL - BERNZY'S APT. - SAME

               As Bernzy comes up the stairs he sees a man in a tweed sports-
               coat with leather arm patches hunched against his front door, 
               reading the New York Times. He looks up from his paper when 
               he hears Bernzy, comes to his feet, smiles pleasantly.

                                     BERNZY
                         What're you doin' up at this hour? 
                         Like I don't know the answer.

               Bernzy is unlocking his door. AARON is his younger brother.

               INT. BERNZY'S APT - SAME

               Aaron is unfazed by the disarray of the apartment.

                                     BERNZY
                         I'm not comin' with you. Coffee?

               Aaron has the same New York accent as his brother but uses 
               the grammar of an educated man.

                                     AARON
                         It's inconceivable to you I just 
                         came over for a little visit?

               Aaron examines the photographs on Bernzy's desk as Bernzy 
               fixes coffee in the bathroom: he pours coffee grinds into a 
               saucepan.

                                     BERNZY
                         Yeah it is.

                                     AARON
                              (he joins Bernzy)
                         Just come sit with him for half an 
                         hour.

               Bernzy imitates the voice of an aged, immigrant Jew from the 
               Lower East Side, via Russia, i.e., his father.

                                     BERNZY
                         'Such a vaste, Leon. Vit' your 
                         beckground, it's a tregedy. Your

                         breaks en old men's heart.'

               He goes back to the coffee, uselessly stirring the grounds.

                                     AARON
                         I don't know what to say. I spend my 
                         life defending you. But when it comes 
                         down to it, I don't know what the 
                         hell you're doing down here --

                                     BERNZY
                         See for yourself; it's no big secret.

                                     AARON
                         Believe me, you look around this 
                         place it leaves you with a few 
                         questions.

                                     BERNZY
                         What's that s'posed to mean?

                                     AARON
                         Forget it... He's a professional 
                         immigrant. He's the ultimate outsider. 
                         But he's an amateur, compared to 
                         you.

                                     BERNZY
                         Yeah? I wonder if you'd say that if 
                         you'd seen me at Cafe Society last 
                         night. I mean inside.

               Bernzy strains the coffee, and pours it.

                                     AARON
                         Yeah? So who invited you? Lou Levitz?

                                     BERNZY
                         He's dead, Professor... How would 
                         you know him, anyway. I thought guys 
                         like you didn't read the tabloids.

               He moves into the main room. Aaron follows.

                         I read the tabloids, Leon. I take an 
                         interest in my brother. I'm glad 
                         you're an insider now. What's that 
                         got to do with Pa, rotting on his 
                         ass down on Delancey Street?

                                     BERNZY
                         Other people're startin' to take an 
                         interest in me, too, alright? When 
                         the time comes, when I get my book 
                         published, I'll go see Pa.

                                     AARON
                         D'you really think your own father's 
                         opinion of you needs to be validated 
                         by a publishing house?

                                     BERNZY
                         No less than anybody else's.

               They look at each other, as Bernzy hands him a mug of coffee.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BERNZY'S APARTMENT - DAY

               The shades are drawn against the daylight. The police radio 
               hisses at low volume. We find Bernzy, slumped asleep in his 
               clothes, in a chair. On the armrest is one of his cigar box 
               files marked "Prizefights." Around Bernzy there is a litter 
               of photos of Kay with her husband, ringside.

               Bernzy holds a picture of Kay in his hand. He fell asleep 
               holding it.

               The telephone rings, shrilly. Bernzy answers it, groggily.

                                     BERNZY
                         'Lo?
                              (he listens)
                         Oh yeah? Right.

               He hangs up the phone. He looks at the picture in his hands -- 
               then at the squalor around him -- then at Kay, again.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Bernzy rides in the passenger seat of Hayward's sportster on 
               the Palisades Parkway. Hayward drinks from his flask.

               EXT. GREENPORT, NEW JERSEY POLICE STATION - DAY

               Bernzy and Hayward climb the steps of the almost rustic police 
               station. Bernzy has his camera.

                                     HAYWARD
                         How you gonna do this?

                                     BERNZY
                         Don't worry about it. Everybody likes 
                         to have his picture took.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GREENPORT POLICE STATION - SAME

               Bernzy is talking to the earnest, red-haired SERGEANT POINTER. 
               Hayward stands in the background, watching.

                                     HAYWARD
                         We had a whole crowd of boys in from 
                         New York last week. Nobody gets to 
                         see those kids.

                                     BERNZY
                         I don't see how the kids matter, 
                         Sgt. Pointer. Do you?

                                     POINTER
                         What're you talkin' about?

                         I don't see that it takes a whole 
                         lot of courage to hit an old lady 
                         with an ax.

                         It's sick, is what it is.

                                     BERNZY
                         That's what I'm sayin'. It's sick. 
                         But to walk into a house with some 
                         sick kid runnin' around with an ax -- 
                         that's courage.

                         those kids.

                              ("surprised")
                         It was you? Then it's your picture I 
                         wanna take. My colleague, Mr. Hayward, 
                         would like to take down your words. 
                         What it was like. You've prob'ly 
                         seen our series in the Saturday 
                         Evening Post. 'Brave me in blue'?

                                     POINTER
                         Yeah. Oh yeah.

               INT. SERGEANTS' OFFICE - LATER

               In an office with three desks, Bernzy has just taken a picture 
               of Pointer in uniform. He is lining up another one. Pointer 
               smiles -- pleased by the attention -- and swells his chest.

               Suddenly Bernzy breaks off in seeming exasperation.

                                     BERNZY
                         No. No, this upsets me. This really 
                         upsets me.

                                     POINTER
                         What's wrong? I do somethin' wrong?

                                     BERNZY
                         You? No. You should be on the $50 
                         bill. It's just not gonna work.

               Bernzy smiles sadly, starts to pack up his camera; Pointer 
               watches forlornly.

                                     POINTER
                         Mr. Bernzini, I think you owe me an 
                         explanation.

                                     BERNZY
                              (reluctantly)
                         ...Who said no pictures of those 
                         kids? It was the D.A., right?

                                     POINTER
                         All of us agreed.

                                     BERNZY
                         But it was the D.A. said it first.

               Pointer doesn't deny it.

                                     BERNZY
                         You see what I'm saying? You ever 
                         caught a fish on vacation?

               Pointer nods.

                                     BERNZY
                         You get a pictue of yourself after 
                         you caught him?

                         Sure.

                         With the fish, or without him.

                                     POINTER
                         No pictures of those kids. That's 
                         final.

                                     BERNZY
                         And I'll tell you why, Sgt. Pointer. 
                         There'll be plenty of pictures of 
                         those kids when the D.A. gets his 
                         conviction. You caught the fish only 
                         he's in the picture.
                              (turning to Hayward)
                         Ready, Hayward.

               Pointer watches as they go out the door.

               Pointer stands alongside the two 17-year-old prisoners. The 
               girl is a pretty redhead; her Boyfriend a good-looking 
               athlete. All three are posing: the Girl pouts like a starlet; 
               the Boy sneers; Pointer is corn-ball stern.

                                     BERNZY
                         This is beautiful. Just like I 
                         pictured it.

                         He wasn't even in the shot?

                                     BERNZY
                         They'd just crop him, anyway. I got 
                         one of him, too. I'll send it to his 
                         mother. 'Case I ever gotta drive 
                         through Greenport.

               Chuckling, Hayward sees a roadside filling station.

                         I gotta stop in here.

               EXT. HAYWARD'S CAR/FILLING STATION - LATER

               An Attendant is filling the tank.

               Hayward takes a large sheet of gas rationing coupons from 
               his billfold.

               Bernzy's eyes narrow. He knows the coupons are significant, 
               but plays it cool.

                                     BERNZY
                         How'd you get so many stamps?

                                     HAYWARD
                         Guy at my garage sold me some extra.

               As Hayward pays the Station Attendant, Bernzy takes the 
               stamps, examines them.

                                     BERNZY
                         Extra? Where's he get extra?

               Bernzy continues to study the stamps as Hayward starts the 
               car, moves toward the highway.

                         stamps?

                         Let's go.

               As Hayward pulls out onto the highway, we hear a car horn 
               scream as we

                                                              SHOCK CUT TO:

               EXT. LOWER WEST SIDE - NIGHT

               The horn comes not from an oncoming car, but from a parked 
               one: the head of a Man murdered while driving is pressed up 
               against the steering wheel, causing the horn to blow 
               ceaselessly. The front end of the car is wrapped around a 
               pole.

               O'Brien, the cop we saw in the first scene leans into the 
               car (parked in a deserted quarter, near the docks) and guides 
               the dead man's head back onto the seat (his hat falls off). 
               The horn stops.

               Beside O'Brien stands his partner, the Young Cop. There are 
               bullet holes piercing the driver's door. The windshield is 
               shattered.

               O'Brien swings around when he hears someone coming up behind 
               him.

                                     O'BRIEN
                         Jesus.

               It's Bernzy. He takes up his camera to get a wide shot -- 
               the car in all it's devastation.

                                     BERNZY
                         His hat fell off.

                                     O'BRIEN
                         Huh?

                                     BERNZY
                         Could you put it back on, please? 
                         People really like to see a dead 
                         guy's hat.

               O'Brien replaces the hat, begrudgingly, again.

                                     O'BRIEN
                         Maybe I should pull his dick out. 
                         Maybe they'd like to see a dead guy's 
                         dick.

                                     BERNZY
                         The News'd prob'ly buy it.

                         Spoleto.

                         dogs fightin' over some stinkin' 
                         bone.

               Bernzy says nothing, keeps his eye to the viewfinder.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE - EARLY MORNING

               Bernzy is sitting on the stoop of a magnificent Beaux-Arts 
               townhouse. He consults his watch.

               A long black sedan pulls up to the cub, on the opposite side 
               of the street.

               Kay gets out, followed by a middle-aged Italian Man in a 
               suit and hat.

               Bernzy sits up, watches keenly as they talk, with evident 
               agitation.

               Now the Man catches sight of Bernzy, takes Kay's arm rather 
               gruffly, and walks her across the street to him.

                                     MAN
                         Bernzy, I want you to tell Kay who I 
                         am.

                                     BERNZY
                         Kay Levitz, Marc-Antony Spoleto.

               Spoleto's Lieutenant gets out of the car, stands in the 
               street.

                                     SPOLETO
                         No -- you to tell her who I am.

                                     BERNZY
                         Mr. Spoleto has the East Side of 
                         Manhattan all to himself.

                         Lucky for us we're on the West Side.

                                     SPOLETO
                         That's no way to talk to your new 
                         partner, Kay.
                              (to Bernzy)
                         You tell her, Bernzy.

               He walks off. He joins his Lieutenant, who walks him back to 
               the car.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         Bernzy gonna set her straight?

                                     SPOLETO
                         If he's thinkin' straight.

                                     LIEUTENANT

                              the car)
                         Why wouldn't he be?

                                     SPOLETO
                         Look at him, over there: it's like 
                         that movie with the Hunchback and 
                         Sasperilla.

               Bernzy, in his rumpled clothes, stands with Kay, in her 
               nightclub finery.

                                     LIEUTENANT

                              (he signals the Driver)
                         Whatever.

               They pull out.

               INT. KAY'S TOWNHOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER (MORNING)

               Bernzy and Kay sit at the kitchen table. A black Maid is at 
               the other end of the enormous room, working; Bernzy speaks 
               softly.

                                     BERNZY
                         If somebody could get his hands on 
                         the gas coupons, if somebody could 
                         control 'em, there'd be a lot of 
                         money in it. Like if this was 
                         Prohibition, and there was only one 
                         source of liquor.

                         know it's that most people ain't 
                         human when there's enough money 
                         involved... I got pictures of guys 
                         killed over 50 cents. For somebody, 
                         that was enough.

                         out.

               He gets up. He moves as he talks.

                                     BERNZY
                         This thing -- this Black Gas -- it's 
                         big: the Feds are up in arms, there's

                         War? What's uglier than somebody 
                         stealing from the fighting boys to 
                         feather his nest? If I can get just 
                         one incriminating photo there's a 
                         front-page uproar, not just tabloids:

               Bernzy nods. She thinks, and then she looks straight at him.

               across from Kay again.

                         books, and when I refused he said

               INT/EXT. BERNZY'S CAR/SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

               The bag of film from the camera store lies on the seat, torn 
               open. Bernzy is already gone from the car.

               EXT. SUBURBAN STREET

               Bernzy walks in shadow, on a self-important Long Island street 
               of mock-Tudor houses and stone villas behind low walls.

               EXT. STREET

               Bernzy climbs a six-foot wall, legs waving maladroitly. At 
               the top, he peers over, manges to pull himself flat onto the 
               wall, then swiftly drops down into

               THE GARDEN

               where he almost breaks his neck: the property drops off 
               steeply inside the wall, where a storm drain is covered in 
               old ivy. Bernzy squats among the shrubs which are set two 
               feet inside the wall. He looks:

               The stone house is guarded by a few men in suits.

               In the bushes, Bernzy extracts a camera from one of his pants 
               pockets and a long lens from the other. He begins to screw 
               the lens onto the camera body, but freezes when he hears a 
               Guard's footsteps crunching on the gravel.

               Bernzy's POV: the Guard swings a flashlight back and forth 
               over the path, onto the shrubs, up along the wall.

               When the Guard has passed, Bernzy screws on the lens. He 
               aims the camera at the house.

               VIEWFINDER POV: The silhouettes of two men are visible behind 
               curtains in a front room, but the laughter of many men can 
               be heard. Panning, we see the stone arched entranceway to 
               the house.

               A Guard sits on a stone bench on the front porch. He sits 
               beneath a tile plaque that says VILLA SPOLETO, illuminated 
               by a tiny bulb. This is the only illumination on the porch; 
               the rest of it is in near-darkness.

               The front door opens, the Guard stands. It's too dark to see 
               the faces of the two men who exit, but Bernzy takes a shot 
               anyway -- "blind." The Men then veer camera left to the 
               driveway, crossing an area of total darkness.

               He looks at his watch: 11:28.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. GARDEN - LATER

               Bernzy consults his watch, again. 2:12. He hears noises from 
               the house, seizes the camera.

               VIEWFINDER POV: The door opens. This time, several men exit, 
               alone or in groups of two or three: the meeting is breaking 
               up. Bernzy can see no faces, shoots blind.

               They all veer off into the darkness of the driveway.

               He clicks the camera, advances the film -- click, click, 
               click.

               ON THE PATH

               two Guards on their rounds hear the soft clicking in the 
               shrubs. They move nearer, carefully. The 1st Guard takes the 
               gun from his holster, cocks it.

               IN THE BUSH

               Bernzy hears their footfalls, freezes.

               ON THE PATH

               the Guards hear a soft rustling in the bush. The 1st Guard 
               takes the gun from his shoulder holster. The two Guards 
               advance slowly, shining their lights.

               The 2nd Guard moves to the bush where Bernzy is hiding while 
               his partner covers him, gun cocked and aimed. In a swift, 
               decisive move, he parts leaves and branches of the bush, 
               exposing the ground behind it. REVERSE:

               Bernzy is not to be seen.

               The 2nd Guard shines his beam into the bush, then up along 
               the wall.

               Shooting low from the other side of the bushes, we see the 
               dirty, ivy-covered storm drain cut into the drop-off at the 
               edge of the property. Only Bernzy's white-knuckled hands can 
               be seen as he holds on from inside the drain.

               The 2nd Guard drops to his knees, shines his light along the 
               base of the wall, under the bushes: he is right over Bernzy.

               We see into the drain, where Bernzy is having a hard time 
               holding on. The Guard is painstakingly thorough in his 
               examination of the area behind the bushes. After an eternity:

                                     GUARD 2
                         Must be them squirrels.

               He releases the bush and he gets up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BERNZY'S APARTMENT - LATER

               Bernzy works feverishly in his darkroom. He coaxes a print 
               to life by agitating a tub. In fact, he has two tubs, and he 
               moves from one to the next in his zeal to see the pictures. 
               We see into one of the tubs:

               The lighter parts of the picture have appeared -- the stone 
               bench, the plaque which says VILLA SPOLETO... Now slowly the 
               faces of two men come into view, i.e., what was invisible to 
               the naked eye is visible to the infra-red.

               Bernzy grasps the print with tweezers, hangs it onto the 
               drying line.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. DARKROOM - LATER

               Now the drying line is filled with shots of men leaving 
               Spoleto's house.

               Bernzy is still over the chemical tub; he hasn't found the 
               face he seeks.

                                     BERNZY
                         C'mon -- come on!

               Now a face comes slowly into view, on the dark part of the 
               porch. It is SAL, the lean-faced lieutenant who was sitting 
               on the couch in Farinelli's office when Farinelli grilled 
               Bernzy. He is on Spoleto's arm in the picture.

                                     BERNZY
                         Sal, you beautiful jerk.

               He lifts the photo out of the tub, triumphantly. But then 
               his eye catches sight of the photo now coming to life in the 
               second tub:

               A Man in a conservative blue suit -- a WASPY gray eminence -- 
               is coming out of Spoleto's front door.

                                     BERNZY
                              (quietly)
                         Holy shit.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BERNZY'S APARTMENT - LATER (MORNING)

               Bernzy, at his desk, takes up a finished print of Sal. He 
               puts it in an envelope. He writes on it in grease-pencil: 
               FARINELLI.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAFE SOCIETY - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON the palm of the Italian Maitre d' as a Man slips a 
               bill into it.

               The MAN, in a dinner jacket, has a stern but florid face; 
               his Wife has a supercilious bearing. As they move:

                                     MAN
                         Table No. 7, Fredo.

                                     MAITRE 'D
                         I'm afraid Mrs. Levitz is at No. 7 
                         this evening, Mr. Brown.

               The Man looks across the room as they move. He sees Kay 
               sitting across from Bernzy; they speak intently.

                                     MAN
                              (not concealing his 
                              distaste)
                         Who's the gentleman?

                                     MAITRE D'
                         I believe he's a poet who recently 
                         escaped Mr. Hitler.

                                     MAN
                         That's still no excuse, is it.

                                     MAITRE D'
                         No, sir... Exactly.

               He pulls out a chair for the Wife with an old-world flourish.

               ON BERNZY and KAY. Bernzy slides the envelope marked Farinelli 
               across the table cloth.

                                     BERNZY
                         This is an incriminating picture of 
                         the informer, Sal Minetto.

               Kay takes the envelope. They sit in a banquette, the music 
               playing across the room.

                                     BERNZY
                         You got a safe or something? At home?

               She nods.

                                     BERNZY
                         If I wind up dead, you give the 
                         picture to Frank Farinelli; but I'm 
                         giving you the picture, which 
                         guarantees I ain't gonna wind up 
                         dead.

                                     KAY
                         I understand.

               She slides the letter into a beaded pocketbook, lying on the 
               table, next to an open bottle of expensive Scotch.

               Bernzy looks around him -- the beautiful nightclub, its well-
               dressed patrons, the polished musicians.

                                     BERNZY
                         My father's been in this country 27 
                         years, it's like he never left Russia. 
                         Sittin' here, I know just what he 
                         must feel like.

                                     KAY
                         Means you need another drink.
                              (she pours him one)
                         That's how they all get the impression 
                         they belong.

                                     BERNZY
                         That's all it takes, huh?

               She nods. They drink. A beat.

                                     KAY
                         You okay?

                                     BERNZY
                         It's startin' to work.

               She smiles. The music plays, something lush and evocative. 
               For a long, exquisite moment he really does believe he 
               belongs.

               But then a dapper Man in dinner clothes leans over Kay, drapes 
               his arm over her.

                                     MAN
                         Kay!

                                     KAY
                         Henry, how are you?
                              (she comes to her 
                              feet)
                         Please meet my friend Leon Bernstein. 
                         Bernzy, this is Henry Haddock, Jr.

                                     HADDOCK
                         Mr. Bernstein.
                              (turning instantly to 
                              Kay)
                         I've half the M.G.M. brass over there, 
                         dying to meet you.

                                     KAY
                         Of course.

               She turns back to Bernzy.

                                     BERNZY
                         G'ahead.

               She scoops up the bag with the letter, nods soberly to Bernzy 
               (i.E., she let's him know she won't let go of it) and walks 
               off with Haddock, who circles his arm around her. He whispers 
               in her ear and she laughs musically.

               We hold on Bernzy, alone at the table, watching Kay -- ever-
               charming, ever-beautiful, meeting half a dozen men in dinner 
               jackets. Bernzy is suffering.

               He gets up abruptly, heads for the door.

               We hold for a moment on the glittering club, as the music 
               swells and people laugh, and then abruptly we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. QUEENS APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT

               Bernzy stands in a dreary silent street in Queens. The club 
               could be a million miles away.

               He holds a page from the phone book. A name, address and 
               phone number are underlined -- those of SALVATORE MINETTO.

               INT. APARTMENT HOUSE HALLWAY - SAME

               A Woman holds the door partly ajar to speak to Bernzy.

                                     WOMAN
                         Hold on. I'll get him.

               Bernzy waits. We can hear a comedy program on somebody's 
               radio echoing down the hall. Now Sal comes to the door, in 
               an undershirt.

                                     BERNZY
                         I'm Bernzy. The photographer --

                                     SAL
                         I know who you are.

                                     BERNZY
                         I'd like to come in.

                                     SAL
                         What for?

                                     BERNZY
                         It has t'd do with Mr. Farinelli.
                              (quietly)
                         And Mr. Spoleto.

               Sal opens the door. Bernzy enters.

               INT. APARTMENT

               He follows Sal through a foyer, into a salon, with high dark 
               furniture and worn doilies.

               Sal's wife, listening to "Amos 'n' Andy" on the radio, watches 
               them pass.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Sal closes the door behind them, hooks the latch. Bernzy, 
               meantime, takes an envelope marked "SAL" from his pocket.

                                     SAL
                         You got your nerve comin' here, little 
                         man.

               Bernzy gives the envelope to Sal.

                                     BERNZY
                         Open it.

               Sal stares at Bernzy angrily for a beat. He takes up a steak 
               knife from the counter, lets it rest ominously in his palm. 
               But then he uses to knife to slice open the envelope.

               Seeing the picture of himself with Spoleto, he merely stares.

                                     BERNZY
                         There's three others just like it, 
                         in sealed envelopes marked 
                         'Farinelli.' I gave 'em to people I 
                         trust. Anything happens to me, they 
                         get sent to Farinelli.

               Sal continues to stare at the photo.

                                     SAL
                         I don't have no money.

                                     BERNZY
                         I don't want any.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KITCHEN - LATER

               Bernzy paces, listening keenly.

               Sal sits at the plain wood table, with a bottle of beer, 
               running through the story quickly, in the present tense.

                                     SAL

                         Yeah, right. But then he can't figure 
                         how to unload 'em. Knows nobody. The 
                         heads of the Five Families won't 
                         touch 'em on account of their gettin' 
                         amnesty from the Feds to work with 
                         the Italian mobs against Mussolini. 
                         Then he hears Lou Levitz on some 
                         radio show: Friend to the Stars, one-
                         time bootlegger, Mr. New York... He 
                         figures maybe an old-timer like Levitz 
                         knows how to unload hot coupons. 
                         Levitz is interested, alright: he's 
                         got a hot young wife to support --

               Bernzy looks up keenly --

                                     SAL
                         and he sees there's maybe millions 
                         in it. He don't have to lift a finger: 
                         he just turns the stamps over to 
                         Spoleto for a fat percentage. Would 
                         you siddown, please?!

                                     BERNZY
                              (he doesn't siddown)
                         Levitz' wife knew about it?

                                     SAL
                         I didn't say that.

                                     BERNZY
                         Did she?

                                     SAL
                         How should I know.

                                     BERNZY
                              (pacing again)
                         Go on.

                                     SAL
                         Then Levitz dies.
                              (sniggering)
                         I guess the old Jew was makin' so 
                         much he figured he was in Heaven 
                         already.

               Bernzy stops pacing; Sal realizes his "gaffe," which seems 
               intentional.

                                     SAL
                         Whoops... Anyway, Portifino's such a 
                         half-wit he figures with the middle-
                         man dead he's free to sell the stamps 
                         to somebody else. By this time, he's 
                         met Farinelli, so he goes to him. 
                         Never mentions Spoleto. The asshole. 
                         He signed his death warrant. End of 
                         story.

               He throws up his hands with finality, gets out of the chair.

                                     BERNZY
                         Wait a second. Didn't they lose the 
                         source? The inside man?

                                     SAL
                         They tortured him first, got the 
                         name of the source.

                                     BERNZY
                         Who's they? Who killed him?

                                     SAL
                         Who knows. Everybody was after this 
                         guy.

                                     BERNZY
                         Who killed him?

                                     SAL
                         Farinelli.

               Bernzy paces, cogitates.

                                     BERNZY
                         So Farinelli gets the name and kills 
                         him. Which means Spoleto doesn't 
                         know the name till you tell him.

               Sal goes to the ice-box. He blinks nervously.

                                     SAL
                         Yeah, I guess so.

                                     BERNZY
                         Gee, Sal: isn't Farinelli gonna be 
                         upset about that?

                                     SAL
                              (getting a bottle 
                              opener from the drawer)
                         Who knows?

               Bernzy reaches into his pocket, takes another print of Sal, 
               tosses it into the drawer.

                                     BERNZY
                         'Who knows'? You're not stupid. What's 
                         Spoleto gonna do to protect you?

               Sal snatches the picture from the drawer, stuffs it in his 
               pocket.

               Bernzy takes out another print, wedges it between the salt 
               and pepper shakers.

                                     BERNZY
                         What's Spoleto gonna do?

                                     SAL
                              (snatching up the 
                              photo)
                         Would you stop?! I told you what I 
                         know.

               Bernzy drops a print to the floor.

               Sal is about to retrieve it, but sees it's futile. Bernzy is 
               already holding another print.

                                     BERNZY
                         Is Spoleto gonna assassinate 
                         Farinelli? Is that it?

                                     SAL
                              (softly, resigned)
                         No. It's worse. Much worse.

                                     BERNZY
                         Tell me, Sal.

               Sal sinks back into the kitchen chair, drops his face into 
               his hands.

                                     BERNZY
                         Tell me.

               Bernzy flips another print; it flutters to the floor, lands 
               at Sal's feet, where he stares down, head in hands.

               Sal mutters two words into his hands. We don't hear them, 
               they're lost...

               But Bernzy seems to hear them. His face grows keen.

                                     BERNZY
                         What?

               Sal looks up angrily, filled with self-disgust.

                                     SAL
                         A massacre, you son of a bitch, a 
                         massacre! Spoleto's gonna wipe out 
                         Farinelli's whole gang -- all my 
                         paesan -- and I'm gonna tell him 
                         where and when.

               Bernzy stares at Sal with astonishment as he slowly takes a 
               seat across from him. He is silent. This is more than he 
               bargained for. Eventually he speaks, quietly.

                                     BERNZY
                         I need to know where and when too, 
                         Sal. You're gonna tell me where and 
                         when too, okay?

                                     SAL
                              (disbelieving)
                         Whaddo you wanna know for? If you're 
                         thinkin of goin' to the Feds, they 
                         just wanna cover this up.

               Bernzy is thinking. Sal shouts.

                                     SAL
                         Whadda you wanna know for?!

               Bernzy looks up. A beat. Then:

                                     BERNZY
                         I wanna take some pictures.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BERNZY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Bernzy is hunched over his portable typewriter, pecking away.

               He pulls the page out of the matchine -- a single-spaced 
               letter -- and reads it, mumbling and pacing.

               He sits back at the desk, signs the letter, takes up an 
               envelope (beneath which Kay's photo still lies on the desk), 
               puts the letter inside, and seals it. On the envelope he 
               writes: MR. ARTHUR NABLER, BEEKMAN APARTMENTS, then TO BE 
               OPENED IN THE --

               At which point the telephone rings.

                                     BERNZY
                         H'lo?
                              (he listens)
                         Awright, don't move: I'm coming.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Kay, in a bathrobe, visibly shaken, opens the door, and Bernzy 
               comes in. He takes her by the arms.

                                     BERNZY
                         What happened? What'd he do?

               He backs her deeper into the foyer, back toward the imposing 
               staircase.

                                     KAY
                         He was here with three men... thugs... 
                         and he kept asking --

               He eases her onto the stairs, where they sit --

                                     KAY
                         -- "Who's the source, Kay? Who's the 
                         inside man?"

                                     BERNZY
                         Did he hit you?

                                     KAY
                              (she shakes her head)
                         He says that comes next time.

                                     BERNZY
                         It's bullshit. He knows the name. 
                         Sal told him. He just wants to know 
                         if you know. You're trouble if you 
                         know... You don't know, right?

                                     KAY
                         No! I didn't even know what he was 
                         talking about!

                                     BERNZY
                              (penitent)
                         I know, I know, I didn't mean that... 
                         Lou had no right t'do this thing to 
                         you. He didn't deserve you. He didn't 
                         know what he had -- he didn't --

               Bernzy draws up short when he realizes what he's saying, 
               what boundary he's crossed. A beat. He clear his throat.

               He digs in his pocket and takes out the picture of the gray 
               eminence on Spoleto's porch.

                                     BERNZY
                         Know this guy?

                         He's a big lawyer in Washington.

                                     BERNZY
                         He was the Governor of Philadelphia. 
                         He had cabinet posts in two Republican 
                         administrations. He has an honorary 
                         post at the Office of Price 
                         Administration.

               When Bernzy says nothing -- merely puts the picture away -- 
               she realizes it's true, realizes how big this thing is.

                         Don't worry about it. They're finished 
                         when I get the pictures. They're all 
                         a bunch of bums when I get the 
                         pictures.

               INT. MOVIE HOUSE - NIGHT

               OPEN ON the screen, which shows a newsreel about the War 
               effort. It is strong stuff -- Nazis on the march, smudge-
               faced G.I.'s in foxholes, coffins of Americans, draped with 
               the flag.

               Bernzy sits alone in the giant movie house -- but he looks 
               anxiously up the aisle -- expecting somebody.

               The newsreel concludes with a fervent pitch for fuel 
               conservation: "Remember, every gallon you save could mean 
               the life of a boy Over There."

               As the cartoon comes on, Sal slinks into the theatre, takes 
               the seat next to Bernzy's.

                                     SAL
                         Farinelli takes all the boys to dinner

                         That's when he's hit.

                                     BERNZY
                         Where? What time?

                                     SAL
                         Dinner's at eight. I get up to take 
                         a leak at 8:15. Spoleto's men come 
                         in a minute later.

                                     BERNZY
                         Where?

                                     SAL
                         I don't know where, yet. We never 
                         do. He always calls us around 6:30, 
                         the day of the dinner.
                              (with bitter irony)
                         F'r safety... It's usually some little 
                         family place or other. In Little 
                         Italy.

                                     BERNZY
                              (wincing)
                         Fam'ly?

                                     SAL
                         Don't worry. He takes the whole place 
                         over f'r the night.

                                     BERNZY
                         Call me as soon as you hear on Friday. 
                         Even before you call Spoleto.

                                     SAL
                              (shaking his head)
                         Spoleto's lieutenant's gonna be with 
                         me when the call comes. But he'll 
                         leave right after. Then I call you.

                                     BERNZY
                         Don't fail me, Sal.

               We see the cartoon on the screen: some creature gets blown 
               up with dynamite, or has a safe fall on his head.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BERNZY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               We are on the door as Bernzy's key scratches in the lock. He 
               comes in, wearily, closes the door behind him. He is startled 
               when he hears a voice behind him.

                                     VOICE
                         H'lo, Bernzy.

               Bernzy swings around, startled.

               A figure sits in the darkness, at Bernzy's desk. He switches 
               on the light. It's Arthur Nabler.

                                     NABLER
                         I came to apologize for the other 
                         night.

               Bernzy looks at his desk: Nabler's hat sits over the spot 
               where the letter is (or was) lying.

                                     NABLER
                         The crazy thing is, I'm in love with 
                         Miss Hixon.

                                     BERNZY
                         Yeah. I kinda figured... You didn't 
                         by any chance --

               Nabler lifts his hat off the envelope: it's torn open, now.

                                     NABLER
                         It was addressed to me. It said "To 
                         be opened --"

                                     BERNZY
                         "In the event of my death." Only I 
                         got kinda busy. I didn't get that 
                         far.

                                     NABLER
                         I figured -- once I opened it... 
                         Why're you doing this, Bernzy?

                                     BERNZY
                         Why? It's what I do, ain't it?
                              (he gestures at the 
                              tabloid pictures 
                              pinned everywhere)
                         Murders, fires, drunks: Life, as it 
                         happens. My motto for 23 years.

                                     NABLER
                         This is death as it happens.

                                     BERNZY
                         That's the main thing about life, 
                         isn't it? Death? I mean, half the 
                         shots are get are somebody just Before 
                         or just After. For once I'll get 
                         During.

                                     NABLER
                         You could stop it. Go to the cops.

                                     BERNZY
                         Really? Think that'd stop it? You 
                         been spendin' too much time at Cafe 
                         Society. It's a war, Arty, these 
                         guys aren't gonna lay off. They're 
                         gonna do it fast or they're gonna do 
                         it slow, but they're gonna do it... 
                         Why don't you tell them photographers 
                         in Europe to stop the War?

                                     NABLER
                         It's not their war --

                                     BERNZY
                         This ain't mine.

                                     NABLER
                         Isn't it?

                                     BERNZY
                         What's that supposed to mean?

                                     NABLER
                         I thought you never took sides, 
                         Bernzy.

                                     BERNZY
                         What're you gettin' at?

                                     NABLER
                         You're doing it for her.

                                     BERNZY
                         You're nuts.

                                     NABLER
                         Am I?

               Bernzy looks at Nabler a beat -- incensed by his glib 
               certitude -- then grabs one of his cigar box files and empties 
               its contents onto the desk: the photos rain down in abundance, 
               covering the desk and spilling onto the floor. They all show 
               fires: buildings ablaze, people running from blazes, firemen 
               carrying children from blazes. As the camera plays over this 
               fantastic display, Bernzy goes to grab another file.

                                     BERNZY
                         Here it is, Arty: the whole history 
                         of New York here with me in this 
                         dump, and it ain't because I went 
                         around interferin' -- hosing down 
                         fires or tellin' people to behave 
                         nice --

               Bernzy unloads an equally plentiful load of dead gangsters 
               onto the desk and floor -- growing more and more passionate 
               in his own defense --

                                     BERNZY
                         They pay people to do that stuff -- 
                         cops, firemen... I'm an artist -- 
                         you're fuckin' right, I am -- and I 
                         let people do whatever the hell 
                         they're gonna do 'cause that's the 
                         only way I can do it right!

               Nabler grabs Bernzy's arm just as he's about to unload a 
               third file.

                                     NABLER
                         Stop it!... Jesus, Bernzy, I may be 
                         the only one in New York who thinks 
                         you are an artist instead of some 
                         kind of animal -- and even I'm not 
                         so sure about this thing. It has a 
                         stink to it...
                              (he shakes his head)
                         Still, if I thought you were doing 
                         it for some kind of crazy fame or 
                         glory, I wouldn't say a word. I know 
                         how much it hurts to be ignored -- 
                         not even reviled, just ignored. But 
                         if you're doing it for her, you're 
                         risking your life for nothing. For 
                         less than nothing.

                                     BERNZY
                         You're gettin' me and you mixed up.

                                     NABLER
                         I hope so. She's cold, Bernzy. She 
                         took old Lou Levitz for everything 
                         he was worth and everybody knows it.

                                     BERNZY
                              (dismissing this)
                         She's just like everybody else in 
                         New York, makin' the best of what 
                         she has.

                                     NABLER
                         No... Maybe I have been spending too 
                         much time at Cafe Society -- just 
                         like you've been on the street too 
                         long... You give your whole life to 
                         something nobody could love and you 
                         wind up a sitting duck. You know 
                         everything about everything, except 
                         what other people take for granted.

                                     BERNZY
                         That's enough, Arty.

                                     NABLER
                         A mansion on the West Side, a place 
                         on the South Shore -- she milked 
                         Levitz so dry he sold himself to a 
                         worm like Spoleto. I wouldn't be 
                         surprised if she was in this thing 
                         from the first.

               Bernzy, incensed, grabs Nabler by the collar --

                                     NABLER
                         You don't hit people, Bernzy. You 
                         can stare at things that'd make a 
                         brute squeamish. But you don't hit 
                         people. That's not what we do, people 
                         like us.

               Bernzy looks at Nabler. He knows he's right. He lets go of 
               him, walks to the door, opens it.

                                     BERNZY
                         G'night, Arty. Thanks for the apology.

               Nabler puts his hat on. He moves to the door. He speaks with 
               sincerity.

                                     NABLER
                         Do me a favor, Bernzy. Tell her what 
                         you're gonna do. Tell her you're 
                         gonna attend a shootout. If she has 
                         any feelings at all for you, she'll 
                         try and stop you.

               Nabler goes out the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAFE SOCIETY - NIGHT

               Bernzy stands near the entrance, holding his book of 
               photographs. He stares across the room to a far table where 
               KAY sits with a large group of well-dressed Men and Women. 
               They're drinking champagne and martinis. A Man is telling a 
               story. Everyone -- Kay included -- laughs riotously.

               Bernzy turns to the Italian Maitre d' at his side.

                                     BERNZY
                         Give this to Mrs. Levitz, wouldja? 
                         Tell her I'll pick it up Saturday.

                                     MAITRE D'
                         You don't wish to -- ?

                                     BERNZY
                         Changed my mind.

               Bernzy watches as everyone at the table laughs again.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOWERY BAR - NIGHT

               A toothless WOMAN sings the last line of a ribald bar song 
               in a filthy place with sawdust on the floor. Those drunks 
               who are still conscious (many lie with their heads on the 
               tables) applaud haphazardly.

               Bernzy takes a flash shot and the Woman raises her glass to 
               him. He finds his own glass and raises it to her. He's in 
               his element, here.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAFE SOCIETY - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON Bernzy's book. A female hand turns the pages. As we 
               see one vivid, ironic or profound vignette after another (a 
               cleaning woman mopping the floor in Grand Central, her human 
               scale diminished by the overspreading dome; Puerto Rican 
               teenagers sleeping on a fire escape; an old man carrying all 
               his possessions from his burning tenement) we begin to 
               understand the power of the book as a book: it's a complete 
               world.

               Some of the pictures have captions, e.g.: a picture of a 
               corpse -- THE STAR ATTRACTION -- alongside a picture of the 
               excited crowd which has gathered: FIRST NIGHTERS.

               They're cleaning up the club around Kay; chairs are overturned 
               on tables. She picks up the book, and heads for the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BERNZY'S APARTMENT - DAWN

               Bernzy is sleeping. The police radio hisses. He stirs.

               Kay stands over him, still in her evening clothes. She's 
               holding the book.

                                     KAY
                         Why're you giving this to me?

               Bernzy clears his throat as he pulls a pair of trousers from 
               a chair next to the bed, drags them on, gets out of the bed.

                                     BERNZY
                         You shouldn't be here, Kay. This is 
                         really no place f'r you t'be.

               Disconcerted by her presence here, he drags the cover over 
               the bed, makes a rushed and futile attempt to tidy the place 
               up. (The photos he dumped onto the desk and floor still lie 
               on the desk and floor.)

                                     BERNZY
                         Didn't -- didn't that maitre d' tell 
                         you? I just wanted you to hold onto 
                         this, that's all. Just till after --

               He trails off.

               He looks at her. Nabler's advice is ringing in his head.

                                     BERNZY
                         It's somethin' nobody ever got 
                         pictures of before. Nobody else ever 
                         will.

                         live volcano, say, that would be

               He takes a seat on the bed. He can't look at her.

               He watches her, watches keenly for her reaction. But it's 
               hard to read: she seems stunned, but keeps it to herself.

               INT. BERNZY'S APT. - DAY

               OPEN ON the day-date calendar on Bernzy's desk. It's torn to 
               FRIDAY. Panning, we find Bernzy's hands, rummaging on the 
               desk for something.

               Amid two or three open boxes of INFRA-RED film, and two roll-
               loading cameras, Bernzy finds a ball of string. He is holding 
               a doorstop (a graded piece of wood).

               With the string, he deftly ties the camera piggyback to the 
               doorstop, sets the timer, puts the camera on the floor. The 
               lens is angled up toward body level.

               The shutter kicks down toward zero, making a distinct sound, 
               ki-ki-ki-ki-ki. But it stuck around five seconds.

                         Dammit.

               He picks it up, finds an oil can, puts a drop of oil on the 
               timer, sets it again. Ki-ki-ki, etc. This time it ticks down 
               to zero, and the shutter clicks.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Bernzy, pacing, consults his watch. It's almost 6:30.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SPOLETO'S OFFICE - SAME

               Spoleto paces behind his desk, consults his watch. His office 
               is more richly furnished than Farinelli's.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SAL'S APARTMENT - EVENING

               Sal paces the hallway of his apartment, consults his watch.

               Spoleto's LIEUTENANT watches him. The phone, sitting on a 
               high table in the hallway, rings. Sal seizes it.

               He hangs up the phone, his artificial cheeriness gone.

                         You'll get over it.

               The Lieutenant pulls a gun, wrapped in a rag, from his coat.

               We hold on Sal's uncomprehending eyes as the gun fires twice. 
               Sal falls to the floor as the Lieutenant flees.

               Sal's wife comes into the hallway, begins shrieking.

               INT. BERNZY'S APARTMENT - EVENING

               Bernzy, muttering nervously, occupies himself by gathering 
               up the photos he spilled onto the desk, collecting them back 
               into their cigar box files...

               He consults his watch. 7:08.

               The alarm clock says 7:20.

               Bernzy paces. The files have been completely restored and 
               sit neatly on the desk.

               Bernzy moves briskly to a chair with a pair of trousers draped 
               over its back. He goes through the pockets, unfolding scraps 
               of paper and old flashbulbs, till he finds what he wants: 
               the page of the phone book with Sal's name, address and phone 
               number.

               He goes to the phone, dials.

                                     BERNZY
                              (into phone)

                         Oh. God. I'm sorry.

               Bernzy hangs up the phone. He sinks into his chair, stunned 
               and defeated. He knocks the newly re-filed boxes of pictures 
               off the desk; they go scattering in every direction.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The Lieutenant of Spoleto who killed Sal pulls up across 
               from Bernzy's apartment. He kills the engine, sets the 
               handbrake.

               INT. BERNZY'S APARTMENT - SAME

               Bernzy, still sunk into his seat, suddenly comes up, infused 
               with new vigor.

               He rummages through a disorganized bookshself, seized by 
               some sort of inspiration, mumbling to himself.

                         ...'he takes the place over'... 
                         'always takes the place over'...

               He finds a book, plonks it onto the desk, takes a seat.

               ON the PHONE BOOK: he pages through quickly till he finds a 
               page headed RESTAURANTS. The numbers are listed 
               geographically, i.e., EAST SIDE, WEST SIDE, CHINATOWN.

               Bernzy's finger finds the column titled LITTLE ITALY. He 
               starts from the top, dials a number. As it rings, he consults 
               his watch. Twenty of eight.

                              (Italian accent)
                         We all booked tonight.

                                     BERNZY
                         Already?

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                         Private party tonight.

                                     BERNZY
                              (sitting up keenly)
                         Oh yeah, sorry to hear that. Maybe 
                         tomorrow... You still at the same 
                         address?

               INT. HALLWAY - SAME

               The Lieutenant approaches Bernzy's door quietly.

               INT. BERNZY'S APARTMENT - SAME

               Bernzy tears the page from the phone book, grabs his hat, 
               his camera, the camera affixed to the piece of wood...

               Someone knocks on the door.

               He looks up.

               INT. HALLWAY - SAME

               The Lieutenant waits. He knocks again.

               INT. BERNZY'S APT - SAME

               Bernzy is frozen, as he sees the doorknob rotate, one way, 
               then the other.

               INT. HALLWAY - SAME

               The Lieutenant picks the cheap lock almost effortlessly.

               INT. APARTMENT

               He takes his gun out as he enters the darkened apartment. He 
               swings around when he hears a Voice.

               It's the police radio.

               He moves stealthfully past the darkroom -- sees the photos 
               hanging on the line...

               Then into the bathroom. Now he sees Bernzy's silhouette, 
               behind the shower curtain, cowering in the stall. He aims 
               his gun at it, then swiftly draws back the curtain.

               It isn't Bernzy: it's an old fashioned portrait camera, with 
               a hood, on a tripod.

               MAIN ROOM

               The Lieutenant returns, switches on the light. He sees the 
               curtain swaying in the breeze. He crosses to the window, 
               parts the curtains. HIS POV:

               Bernzy has descended the fire escape.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EXT/BERNZY'S CAR - NIGHT

               Bernzy watches in frustration as a Workman guides a truck 
               which is backing up into the street, blocking traffic in 
               both directions. Bernzy slams the wheel, curses his luck.

               He looks at his watch. Four minutes before eight.

               The moment the narrowest semblance of a lane is clear, he 
               passes two other cars and drives through the narrow gap, 
               passes it, and speeds away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BERNZY'S APARTMENT - SAME

               The Lieutenant is on the phone.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                              (into phone)
                         I looked. He ain't here.

                                                               INTERCUT TO:

               INT. SPOLETO'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Spoleto, on the other end of the line.

                                     SPOLETO
                              (he thinks; into phone)
                         No matter; we'll get him later.

               He hangs up the phone. He looks over to THATCHER WHITE, the 
               Republican gray eminence.

                                     SPOLETO
                         Bernstein got away.

               White glares, as if at an incompetent servant.

                                     SPOLETO
                         We'll go ahead with the hit, as 
                         planned.

                                     WHITE
                         Is that really wise, Mr. Spoleto?

                                     SPOLETO
                         He don't know where it's gonna happen. 
                         He don't know it's d'Angelo's. We're 
                         home free.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. D'ANGELO'S CAFE - NIGHT

               d'Angelo's is a simple storefront building with a plate glass 
               window, filmy curtains, a plainly-lettered sign. A neon clock 
               in the window says TIME TO EAT.

               Right now it's two minutes before eight.

               REVERSE:

               BERNZY stands across the street from d'Angelo's. He has his 
               camera around his neck, the time release camera in hand.

               Through the filmy curtains he can see that no one is eating 
               inside, i.e., no one from Farinelli's gang has arrived yet.

               One door down from d'Angelo's, he sees a gap between the 
               buildings which leads to a rear alley. He looks both ways 
               before crossing the street quickly.

               EXT. ALLEY BEHIND D'ANGELO'S

               Through the screen door, Bernzy can see a black Scullion in 
               an apron. He scrapes potato peelings into a metal can by the 
               door. Beyond him, we can see d'ANGELO and MRS. d'ANGELO, the 
               middle-aged couple who run the place. They are preparing 
               food at the stove.

               Bernzy gestures to the Scullion, trying to lure him out into 
               the alley with bills he waves in his hand.

               The Scullion looks at his boss, back at Bernzy. He picks up 
               the metal can, and walks it back into the alley.

                                     BERNZY
                         Listen, whaddo they pay you here?

               The Scullion empties the trash into the dumpster.

                                     BERNZY
                         Two-fifty? Three bucks a week?

               The Scullion just stares.

                                     BERNZY
                              (giving him three 
                              bills)
                         Here's two month's pay.
                              (and another one)
                         Here's three months, I got no time 
                         to haggle.

                                     SCULLION
                         What'you want?

               INT. KITCHEN

               The Scullion re-enters. He picks up a tray of water glasses 
               and looks to the Chef. The Chef nods. The Scullion carries 
               them toward the dining room, passing through a narrow

               HALLWAY

               that connects it to the kitchen.

               DINING ROOM

               Four square tables have been pushed together to create a 
               single rectangular table in the center of the restaurant. 
               The cafe's other tables have been pushed to the outside walls, 
               for tonight's private party.

               The Scullion sets the tray with water glasses on one of the 
               tables pushed to the side.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. D'ANGELO'S - SAME

               Bernzy stands pressed against the front door, looking at his 
               watch. It's 8 o'clock. He watches the street nervously as A 
               DARK SEDAN turns the corner onto the street, up the block.

                                     BERNZY
                         Fuck.

               The Scullion unlocks the door behind him and Bernzy ducks 
               in.

               INT. DINING ROOM

               The Scullion leads Bernzy through the dining room back toward 
               the hallway, cautioning Bernzy to wait while he makes sure 
               the coast is clear.

               EXT. STREET

               The car pulls up in front.

               INT. D'ANGELO'S HALLWAY

               Bernzy is moving one of the tables pushed to the side of the 
               restaurant closer to the hallway. Through the curtained 
               window, he sees FARINELLI getting out of his car.

               Bernzy ducks down beneath the level of the windows. He adjusts 
               the table cloth of the table he just moved, bringing it closer 
               to the floor on the dining room side.

               The Scullion opens the door of a closet in the hallway, and 
               beckons Bernzy to come.

               Bernzy looks behind him, to the door, as he scurries, low, 
               toward the closet door.

               THE CLOSET

               is ridiculously cramped -- filled with mops, brooms, buckets, 
               lightbulbs. Just as FARINELLI opens the cafe's front door 
               The Scullion lifts a broom in the closet and Bernzy ducks 
               under it.

               DINING ROOM

               Farinelli sees the Scullion replacing a broom in a closet, 
               and closing the closet door.

               The Chef hurries down the hallway, past the Scullion, to 
               greet Farinelli and his Men. There is a great deal of 
               obsequiousness and hand-kissing. Everyone speaks in Italian.

               EXT. STREET

               Another car pulls up, and four more of Farinelli's men get 
               out of it.

               INT. CLOSET

               Bernzy, impossibly cramped in the dim closet, gingerly lifts 
               a roll loaded camera on a strap out of his oversized jacket 
               pocket. He can hear the Italian voices. A bucket wobbles and 
               he has to freeze. He secures the bucket, and lifts the camera 
               strap over his head and onto his shoulders.

               INT. DINING ROOM

               Farinelli and his men are sitting down as three more gang 
               members enter.

               INT. CLOSET

               Bernzy looks at his watch. It's ten past eight. He's soaked 
               in sweat and very cramped. He can hear the muffled voices of 
               Farinelli and his men. We can feel the heat, the darkness, 
               the anxiety of this claustrophobic eternity.

               INT. DINING ROOM

               The Chef is serving wine around the table as Farinelli, at 
               its head, speaks in subtitled Italian.

                                     FARINELLI
                         I got some news just before I left 
                         the house... This time it's Sal.

               The Men take the news without evident emotion.

                                     FARINELLI
                              (to the Chef)
                         Leave us.

               The Chef nods, and heads up the hallway.

               INT. CLOSET

               Bernzy checks his watch. He gingerly shifts his position, in 
               order to remove the time-release camera, on its graded piece 
               of wood, from his other suit pocket. He can hear the muffled 
               Italian voices, outside: they're discussing how to avenge 
               Sal's death.

               EXT./INT. ALLEY BEHIND D'ANGELOS/CAR

               A long car idles in the alley.

               Inside are four of SPOLETO'S MEN, carrying automatic weapons, 
               and a Driver. The Lead Assassin studies his watch.

               INT. CLOSET

               Bernzy studies his watch, then sets the timer on the time-
               release camera.

               INT. KITCHEN

               The d'Angelos set the last few pieces onto an antipasto 
               platter.

               The screen door is yanked back: Spoleto's men run through 
               the back door. d'Angelo, Mrs. d'Angelo and the Scullion drop 
               their utensils and duck down behind the counter.

               Mrs. d'Angelo crosses herself.

               INT. CLOSET

               Bernzy hears the running footsteps of the Assassins. In one 
               hand he holds the time-release camera; the other grips the 
               knob of the closet door.

               DINING ROOM

               As Spoleto's Men come into the dining room, a few of 
               Farinelli's men see them and go for their guns. But Spoleto's 
               men already have their guns ready and aimed.

                                     LEAD ASSASSIN
                         Don't try it. On your feet.

               Behind him, we see the broom-closet door sway open slowly.

               INT. KITCHEN

               The d'Angelos and the Scullion crawl out by the screen door.

               INT. DINING ROOM

               Spoleto's men are arrayed (weapons aimed) on either side of 
               the table, i.e., looking across the table, not toward the 
               kitchen and not toward the street.

               As Farinelli's men stand, ostensibly obedient, some dive, 
               some upend furniture for cover, others go for their weapons. 
               One races for the front door.

               Spoleto's Men open fire, even as Bernzy rushes to the edge 
               of the dining room, already taking his first shot.

               [N.B.: The sudden, brutish violence of the scene has the 
               paradoxical effect of making it feel longer, in the 
               inexplicable way a car wreck seems prolonged for the drivers. 
               A series of inter-locking cuts -- hand on gun, shells on 
               floor, splattering of tablecloth, flare from gun, hand on 
               camera, etc. -- extenuates time like a slowed-down nightmare 
               in which the dreamer tries to flee something menacing.]

               Bernzy kneels behind the table set against the wall outside 
               next to the hallway -- the one he moved earlier.

               Bernzy kicks the time-release camera: it slides out toward 
               the side wall, aimed upward at the killers and ticking down.

               The scene is sensational, nearly surreal, with bright lights 
               flaring in every direction... spent shells bouncing off the 
               ground... food, wine and blood spattering onto the white 
               table-cloths.

               Bernzy stands for his second shot as The Assassin opens fire 
               on Farinelli's bodyguard, who has managed to pull his gun. 
               Then he spots Bernzy. Bernzy's camera is aimed at the Assassin 
               even as the Assassin turns to kill him. Brazenly, Bernzy 
               continues to shoot.

               Through Bernzy's viewfinder, we see what he's seeing: his 
               own murder.

               Just before the Assassin pulls the trigger, one of Farinelli's 
               Men, who has managed to pull his gun, shoots him.

               Bernzy, seemingly impervious (or possessed) is already 
               advancing the film.

               Bernzy is only partly hidden by the table and its overhanging 
               cloth: his feet show, he must stand half-erect every time he 
               takes a picture. We feel is protected not by the table as 
               much as by his single-mindedness: he is an appendage of the 
               camera.

               A bullet tears into the lip or leg of the table Bernzy uses 
               for cover. There is a violent shudder. He is not sure, and 
               we are not sure, if he has been hit by a bullet, or stung by 
               the table itself. He just keeps shooting pictures.

               By now there is a horrible litter of wood, cloth, food, blood 
               and corpses on the floor.

               ON the time-release camera, next to a corpse: it is stuck, 
               at five seconds, as it was at Bernzy's apartment.

               The Lead Assassin gives the signal. The shooting ends as 
               abruptly as it began. Farinelli and all his men are dead.

               They leave by the front door. But the last Gunman to leave 
               looks curiously over his shoulder, as if he thinks he saw 
               something. Then he hurries off, to catch up with the others.

               EXT. STREET

               The Assassins' car is parked in the street. The last Gunman 
               approaches it but still seems dissatisfied. Sirens are heard, 
               growing closer.

               INT. DINING ROOM

               Bernzy rises unsteadily to his feet. He winces, but whether 
               he is wounded, or merely reacting to the devastation around 
               him, we still don't know. He cocks his ear as he judges how 
               far off the sirens are, i.e., how much time does he have.

               He begins to take pictures of the massacre's aftermath.

               Hearing someone crunch over glass, he looks up.

               The curious Gunman has returned. As the sirens draw nearer, 
               the Gunman raises a pistol.

               A distinctive noise is heard from the side of the room: ki-
               ki-ki-ki-ki-click.

               The Gunman swings around, thinking it is one of Farinelli's 
               men, wounded but not dead. As he fires into a corpse --

               Bernzy makes a run for the back hallway.

               The Gunman whirls around again, to fire at Bernzy, but 
               Bernzy's gone.

               As the sirens draw very close now, the Gunman flees by the 
               front door.

               EXT. STREET

               A police car rounds the corner --

               EXT. STREET

               Low Angle, on the running board of the getaway car, as the 
               curious gunman jumps into the car, even as it squeals away.

               STREET

               The police car screeches to a stop in front of d'Angelo's.

               INT. DINING ROOM

               Bernzy has re-entered. He kneels down to get the time-release 
               camera. We see a GUN aimed at him, at the end of an arm.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Hold it!

               Bernzy looks up. It's O'Brien, the cop.

               O'Brien puts down the gun when he sees Bernzy's face.

                                     O'BRIEN
                         Jesus, Bernzy.
                              (he looks around the 
                              room; he's horrified)
                         What the hell is this?

               Bernzy snatches up his camera, starts to move toward the 
               back exit.

                                     O'BRIEN
                         Where you goin'? What the hell's 
                         goin' on here?

               Berzny keeps moving, then turns and runs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NABLER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Nabler, asleep by the radio (which plays an opera), is aroused 
               by somebody pressing his doorbuzzer, frantically.

               INT. HALLWAY

               Nabler opens the door.

                                     BERNZY
                         C'mon, Arty. Now.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ELEVATOR - NABLER'S BLDG.

               Bernzy and Nabler ride down. Nabler's pulling on his coat. 
               Bernzy is unloading the time-release camera, shielding it 
               from the light within the ample folds of his oversized jacket.

                                     NABLER
                         What if Spoleto finds you?

                                     BERNZY
                         He's finished the second you get 
                         these to the papers.

               He caps the film in a can and gives it to Nabler.

                                     BERNZY
                         I'll get arrested first, with any 
                         luck.

               Now Bernzy reachs into his pants pocket to get out a roll of 
               film already in a can. When he does so, his coat swings open.

                                     NABLER
                         Jesus, Bernzy: You're bleeding.

               Indeed, a spreading stain of blood soaks Bernzy's shirt on 
               the right side of his torso.

               Bernzy presses the roll of film on Nabler.

                                     BERNZY
                         Take those to the Mirror, The Post, 
                         The Telegraph, The News, Life Magazine --

                                     NABLER
                         I know the routine.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. NABLER'S BLDG. - NIGHT

               As Bernzy and Nabler come out of the building they see Two 
               police cars -- one astride and one nose-to-nose with Bernzy's 
               sedan. The Policemen are on the street.

               The eldest of them approaches Bernzy, gently pulls Bernzy's 
               hands behind his back, and cuffs him: like every other cop 
               in New York, he knows Bernzy.

                                     POLICEMAN
                         Sorry, Bernzy.

               He is led toward a police car.

                                     NABLER
                         F'r God's sakes, he's bleeding!

                                     BERNZY
                              (as he disappears 
                              into the squad car)
                         Go, Arty. Now!

               Nabler hails a cab.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FEDERAL BLDG. (CHURCH STREET) - NIGHT

               Bernzy is led up the steep stairs.

               INT. FBI CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

               Bernzy sits at a table in a large conference room. The table 
               is packed with law enforcement personnel, mostly in suits. 
               Some of them we recognize: Chadwick, the FBI agent; Chadwick's 
               superior, the Older Agent; Conklin, the homicide detective.

               Various men are smoking and various ashtrays are filled. 
               Somebody's yawning. Time has passed.

                                     CHADWICK
                              (to a D.A.)
                         Read him the statues about with-
                         holding evidence again.

               Bernzy is beginning to look weak.

                                     BERNZY
                         I told you, I had no evidence.

                                     CHADWICK
                         Then how'd you happen to be there?

                                     BERNZY
                         How am I anywhere? I'm psychic.

               One of the Cops smiles.

               The Older agent, seeing it, is incensed.

                                     OLDER AGENT
                         You're out of your league here, Mr. 
                         Bernstein. The police may take this 
                         lightly but I'll be goddamned if the 
                         Bureau's gonna let a picture peddler 
                         create a scandal in the O.P.A. that's 
                         gonna undermine morale and hurt the 
                         war effort.

               Bernzy removes a blood-soaked handkerchief from his side, 
               crumples it up.

                                     BERNZY
                              (groggy but annoyed)
                         I didn't create the damn scandal.

                                     CONKLIN
                              (tossing him a fresh 
                              handkerchief)
                         Just tell us where the pictures are, 
                         Bernzy. Nobody here's enjoying this.

                                     BERNZY
                              (looking at the Older 
                              Agent)
                         I'm not so sure.

                                     OLDER AGENT
                         Put him in jail.

                                     CONKLIN
                         Sir, he's bleeding.

                                     OLDER AGENT
                         Put him in jail!

               As two uniformed Cops go to Bernzy's chair, an officiously 
               swift WOMAN enters and whispers in the Older Agent's ear.

                                     OLDER AGENT
                         Hold it... The Chief of Police is 
                         coming in.

               The CHIEF OF POLICE enters, carrying a stack of newspapers. 
               A Young Cop in a suit follows him, carrying a larger stack 
               of newspapers.

               The Feds stay put, but the police personnel all rise in 
               recognition of his rank.

                                     CHIEF
                         Stay down.

               The Chief and his Assistant deal the newspapers onto the big 
               table.

               As they hit the table, and various people seize them eagerly, 
               we cut from tabloid cover to tabloid cover.

               All of them carry full size front page photos of the shooting. 
               The pictures are grainy, owing to the infra-red film, but 
               this gives them an even more nightmarish aspect.

               The rigidly set faces of the killers are plainly visible. 
               The bullets flaring from the gun barrels are seen like streaks 
               of light.

               One tabloid shows a mesmerizing shot of the murdered Assassin 
               staring straight at the camera, when he had a bead on Bernzy. 
               Others show the staggered, falling, or crumpled bodies of 
               the victims.

               At least two tabloid have the fortuitous shot (taken by the 
               late-functioning timer camera) of the Curious Gunman shooting 
               Bernzy: the Gunman is in the foreground, with his back to 
               us, his shooting arm extended, his hand and gun plainly 
               visible; Bernzy is in the background as he waits for the 
               trigger to be pulled.

               The double-bold headlines read as follows: GAS WAR!!!!! 
               SHUTTERBUG SHOOTS MOB SHOOTERS POISON GAS! PHOTOS SHOW: THEY 
               KILL THEIR OWN SHUTTERBUG SEZ: "I DID IT FOR G.I. JOE!" MOBFIA 
               AT WAR!

               The shot with Bernzy in it is headlined -- THE GREAT BERNZINI!

               Another tabloid splits the page between two photos -- Thatcher 
               White -- HE SOLD OUT G.I. JOE -- and Bernzy -- HE SAVED HIM!

               Finally, we see a copy of the New York Times, without a 
               photograph, and with a non-bold headline over a discreet 
               column below: PHOTOGRAPHER'S PICTURES SAID TO DEPICT BLACK 
               MARKET CONFLICT -- Ex-Governor White Implicated In Rationing 
               Scandal.

               Meantime, the Chief of Police speaks.

                                     CHIEF
                         According to the Times you're going 
                         to be lauded on the floor of the 
                         Senate tomorrow. Senator Watkins 
                         will officially thank you for saving 
                         the lives of American servicemen... 
                         How'd you manage to get the shot of 
                         yourself?

                                     BERNZY
                         Timer.

                                     CHIEF
                         Right... I have an advance copy of 
                         Walter Winchell's Sunday night 
                         broadcast, lead item.
                              (reading)
                         'Good Evening, Mr. & Mrs. America, 
                         etc. Tonight a tip of the hat to one 
                         Leon Bernstein, better known as The 
                         Great Bernzini. Many's the night 
                         your reporter has seen Bernzy, the 
                         s'posedly sorcerous shutterbug at 
                         Hanson's all-night drug-store -- one 
                         face among many of New York's silent 
                         army of dedicated newspapermen...'

               As they Chief reads, we pan the faces around the table. The 
               reactions range from amusement (among the cops) to 
               consternation (among the Feds) to outrage (the Older Agent).

                                     CHIEF
                         'But Friday night, Bernzy proved 
                         himself a great photographer, a great 
                         New Yorker, and a great American. 
                         His first ever photos of the Mobfia 
                         at war nips in the bud what was 
                         potentially one of the foulest 
                         scandals in American history. Two 
                         nights ago, only a select few knew 
                         the meaning of the phrase "Black 
                         Gas." Now, thanks to Bernzy, we all 
                         know, and we all cry out against 
                         this shameless profiteering. Thank 
                         you, Bernzy, for saving the lives of 
                         countless American's Over There. 
                         Thank you on behalf of this reporter, 
                         all Gotham, and all America.'

               The Chief looks up from the page, to Bernzy.

               Bernzy, clinging to the blood-soaked handkerchief, has passed 
               out.

                                     CHIEF
                         Get him to the hospital.

               As Bernzy, conscious but weak from his loss of blood, is led 
               down the stairs outside the Federal Building, propped up by 
               two cops, it is he who is now in the public eye.

               He is surrounded by a mob of reporters and photographers, 
               shouting questions and popping flashbulbs frenetically.

                                     REPORTERS/PHOTOGRAPHERS
                         How'd you know about it, Bernzy/ 
                         Bernzy, give us a shot!/Why'd you do 
                         it, Bernzy?/Bernzy, over here!/ Give 
                         us something, Bernzy!/Mr. 
                         Bernstein!/Bernzy!!

               Bernzy smiles as he is led down the stairs, a peculiar, 
               blissed out, half-delirious smile. He is half-delirious from 
               his blood loss, the frenzied atmosphere, the incessant flashes 
               of light.

               Bernzy's POV: The Reporters scream, the flashbulbs pop 
               blindingly, until there is such a frenetic burst of bulbs, 
               the screen is bleached white.

               The WHITE SCREEN holds for some seconds, and then we

               FADE IN:

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

               Bernzy, hat in hand, enters a hospital room with flowers in 
               it, and soft light. He approaches the bed, where Kay lies, 
               holding in her arms a new-born Infant.

               A rather stern Nurse in metal-framed glasses waits to take 
               the child back to the nursery.

                                     KAY
                         H'lo, Bernzy.

               Almost shyly, he approaches the bed, smiling at the child. 
               He sits on the edge of the bed, takes the child's hand.

                                     BERNZY
                         She looks just like you. Thank God.

               Kay smiles. But then she's crying. Bernzy nods to the nurse, 
               who takes away the child.

                                     BERNZY
                         What is it? What's wrong?

                                     KAY
                         I was so lost... so lost.

               He strokes her face.

                                     BERNZY
                         Forget about it. It's all over... 
                         Talk about lost. I used to think it 
                         was like a rule. Once you gave 
                         yourself over to something different, 
                         something other, somethin' normal 
                         people turned their backs on, you 
                         lost your chance to be normal. To be 
                         human. Just to be human.

               As we hold on him, staring into space, thinking, we hear 
               Kay, trying to get his attention, to break his reverie.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

               Bernzy's position and Kay's are reversed, i.e.: he's the one 
               in the hospital bed, she sits over him, trying to get his 
               attention.

               This hospital room -- the real one -- is harshly lit; there 
               are no flowers. Bernzy is hooked up to an I.V., attached, at 
               the other end, to a dripping bottle.

               The same stern Nurse stands over the bed.

               As Bernzy comes to he sees Kay, her face close to his, 
               speaking quietly. He seems utterly disoriented -- not ready 
               to leave his dream.

               Kay looks to the Nurse who nods and goes out.

                         you in, lousy bastards.

               Kay smiles sweetly, but Bernzy is cold and unresponsive.

               He stares at her face. She wonders what's wrong with him.

                         right picture. But this was different. 
                         It was different, Bernzy. You didn't

                         when you started to help me. And for

                         didn't want a better seat, or an 
                         introduction. You didn't know enough

                         judge me. The night we sat there and 
                         had a drink I knew they were all 
                         watching. I knew they were whispering. 
                         For once I didn't give a damn. You 
                         sat there in your lousy suit and you 
                         were the only one who wasn't a climber 
                         or a schemer or a snob, and for once 
                         I didn't feel like one, either...

               EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

               VERY CLOSE ON a Middle-Aged Woman who shouts almost 
               ecstatically, her mouth rimmed with too much red lipstick.

                                     WOMAN
                         It's him!

               Around her, a kind of pandemonium breaks loose.

               As Bernzy, with Nabler on one side of him and Hayward, the 
               Ivy League, alcoholic reporter on the other, comes out the 
               door, The crowd -- as big as a mob -- presses in. There are 
               dozens upon dozens of Reporters and Photographers. The 
               Reporters shout for Bernzy's attention and the Photographers 
               take a never-ending series of flash shots.

               Autograph seekers thrust tabloid covers and pens at Bernzy, 
               or autograph books, or copies of Life Magazine. Grinning 
               Teenagers and Mothers of G.I.'s just want to touch him.

               Bernzy, in his street clothes and ostensibly recovered, is 
               emotionally muted, without his usual quick eyes, purposeful 
               movements, rapid steps. He offers an occasional wave, or a 
               tepid smile, but he seems totally overwhelmed.

               As they descend the crowded stairs, a 60ish, well-dressed, 
               Man in the crowd is more or less pulled into their immediate 
               orbit by Nabler.

               Nabler shouts; he has to.

                                     POLICEMEN (B.G.)
                         Hiya, Bernzy!/Congratulations!

               Bernzy smiles at them as they pass -- but the smile is 
               fleeting.

                                     NABLER
                         With an Arthur Nabler introduction 
                         for 'Public Eye' he'll guarantee a 
                         double-sized first printing.
                              (to Gerard)
                         What was the advance you mentioned?

               Gerard quotes the figure as they pass through a particularly 
               loud section of the crowd, a particular dense thicket of 
               flash-bulbs.

                                     NABLER
                              (smiling, never missing 
                              a beat)
                         Smile everybody, Time Magazine.

               Bernzy moves along automatically, buffeted along by the crowd: 
               people extend their hands, poke their smiling faces in front 
               of him.

                                     NABLER
                         So -- can we agree to this deal in 
                         principle.

                                     GERARD
                         We have the greatest enthusiasm.

                                     BERNZY
                         Right.

                                     GERARD
                         Are you okay?

                                     BERNZY
                         Don't like to have my picture took.

                                     NABLER
                         Mr. Gerard's on the Board at the 
                         Modern Museum. He says there's real 
                         interest there, as well.

                                     GERARD
                         I have to keep mum on the matter -- 
                         conflict of interest -- but there's 
                         more than enough support already.

                                     BERNZY
                         Right.

                                     GERARD
                              (to Nabler)
                         Is he okay?

                                     NABLER
                         It's this crowd... We'll speak to 
                         you tomorrow, Albert.
                              (he steers Bernzy 
                              through the crowd)
                         Car's over there.

               As Bernzy continues to be photographed, and shouted at, to 
               have autograph books and tabloid covers thrust at him by 
               people with pens and pencils, he and Nabler and Hayward make 
               their way to the curb, where Bernzy's sedan is parked.

               Nabler gives Hayward the car keys.

               As they get in the car, the crowd presses in: they're 
               desperate to make contact with Bernzy.

                                     NABLER
                              (to Bernzy)
                         This'll blow over before your 
                         bandages're off.

               Bernzy and Nabler get in back; Hayward takes the wheel, turns 
               back to Bernzy.

                                     HAYWARD
                         You allowed to drink?

                                     NABLER
                         He can have a short one. I asked 
                         inside.

               When Hayward starts the car, the police radio crackles to 
               life.

                                     HAYWARD
                         It's your town, Bernzy: what'll it 
                         be? Cafe Society?

               Even in Bernzy's distracted state, this is like a slap in 
               the face.

                                     BERNZY
                         Huh?

               Nabler takes him by the shoulders and speaks to him, low and 
               intent.

                                     NABLER
                         Goddamit, Bernzy: let it go. This is 
                         what you've been waiting for your 
                         whole life. Whatever it took, it's 
                         worth it.

                                     BERNZY
                         Let it go?

               Somebody pounds on the window.

                                     NABLER
                         Let it go.

                                     BERNZY
                         How do you do that?

                                     NABLER
                         I don't know. Nobody does. Welcome 
                         to the real world. You're just like 
                         everybody else now. Only you're gonna 
                         get fawned over by a lot of jerks 
                         when our book gets published.

                                     BERNZY
                              (a beat)
                         It's my book. I'm writin' the 
                         introduction.

                                     NABLER
                              (secretly pleased)
                         Fine...
                              (turning to Hayward)
                         Let's go to the Stork Club.

               Hayward begins to ease the car away from the curb, but it's 
               hard with the mob outside.

               He points to the police radio, crackling, an added distraction 
               he doesn't need.

                                     HAYWARD
                         How d'you turn this damn thing off.

               He looks for the switch.

                                     BERNZY
                         You can't.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Huh?

                                     BERNZY
                         You can't turn it off.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Here's the switch, right here.

                                     BERNZY
                         I said you can't turn it off!

                                     HAYWARD
                         Like I say: it's your town, Bernzy.

               He puts the car in gear.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               When we cut outside it is to black and white. We don't hear 
               the mob: we hear the police short-wave hissing.

               As Photographers run alongside the car to poke their cameras 
               at the windows, as teenagers chase after the car, as the 
               grim-faced Policemen try to guide the car through the morass 
               of humanity, as an Older Woman begins to cry, it is a series 
               of Bernzy-like tableaux, the silent images filled in only 
               with the hiss of the radio.

               The car gets free of the crowd and continues up the street. 
               We crane up to watch it, as it disappears into the New York 
               night.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
