In the 1940s, Leon "Bernzy" Bernstein is a free-lance photographer for the New York City tabloids, dedicated to his vivid and realistic work and his ability to get shots nobody else can get.
He is very confident of his skills, declaring at one point, "Nobody does what I do.
Nobody."

With a police radio under the dashboard of his car and a makeshift darkroom in his trunk, he quickly races to the scene of horrific crimes and accidents in order to snap exclusive photographs.
He's so good at his job that he becomes known affectionately as the "Great Bernzini."

Bernzy meets the sultry widow Kay Levitz, who owns a nightclub.
It seems the mob is muscling in on her due to some arrangement with her late husband.
Kay asks if Bernzy could investigate an individual she considers troublesome.
Generally unsuccessful with women, Bernzy agrees to help.
In fact, he begins falling in love with Kay.

After talking to his contacts, including journalist friend Arthur Nabler, he tracks down Kay's man, only to find him dead.
But when he calls the police, he becomes a suspect.
The police and the FBI are also very interested in this case.
Bernstein makes a connection with gangster Sal, uncovering a conspiracy involving a mob turf war, gas rationing and the government.
His activities get Sal killed and place Bernzy's life in great danger as he waits in hiding at a restaurant where a mob hit is about to take place.
