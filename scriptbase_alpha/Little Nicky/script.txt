    "LITTLE NICKY" -- by Tim Herlihy, Adam Sandler & Steven Brill



     FADE IN:

     EXT. SUBURBIA - NIGHT

     A beautiful late summer night.  Crickets chirping, sprinklers
     sprinkling.

     We PAN across one particular lawn, up one particular tree,
     where we see THE PEEPER (Jon Lovitz) sitting on a limb.  He
     has a bottle of wine, some sandwiches, a Walkman.  Suddenly
     the lights turn on.

                    PEEPER
               (whispering)
          Showtime!

     We see a young mother walk into the room outside the Peeper's
     window.  She is wearing business attire.

                    PEEPER (CONT'D)
          Rough day at the office Mrs. Dunleavy?
               (takes bite of sandwich)
          Well you'll feel better once you slip
          off those work clothes and get into some
          sweats.

     The mother sits on the bed and pulls off her shoes, rubbing
     her feet.

                    PEEPER (CONT'D)
          Oh my G-D, yes!  I wish you would let me
          rub those feet.  Of course I wouldn't
          use my hands.  Heh heh heh heh...

     He sips some wine.

     The mother starts to unbutton her blouse.  She takes it off,
     revealing a nice bra.

                    PEEPER (CONT'D)
          Looks like Victoria just told me her
          secret.

     The peeper frantically writes in a dirty notebook.  Mouthing
     the words as he goes.

                    PEEPER (CONT'D)
          Thursday the ninth, eight-thirty p.m.,
          first brassiere sighting...
               (stops writing)
          I will pleasure myself to this image for
          months.  MONTHS I TELL YOU!

     The mother starts to unbutton her pants.  Her young son walks
     in wearing a scouts uniform.

                    PEEPER (CONT'D)
          Young Scottie Dunleavy.  What
          unfortunate timing.  You mother was just
          getting comfy.

     The son talks to his mother excitedly.

                    PEEPER (CONT'D)
          Yes, yes, I'm sure you tied many great
          knots today or whatever.  Now get out.

     The son, not going anywhere, sits in a chair.

                    PEEPER (CONT'D)
          Now what.  This simply won't do.

     The peeper takes out a cell phone and dials.  The son
     answers.

                    SCOTTIE
          Hello?

                    PEEPER
          Hello, Scottie.  Why don't you go
          downstairs like a good boy and let your
          mother freshen up.

                    SCOTTIE
          Who is this?

                    PEEPER
          Just a little birdie.  A birdie who
          wants to see if your mother's panties
          match her bra.

                    MOTHER
          Oh my G-D Scottie.  Is there a man up
          our tree?

     The peeper gets nervous.

                    PEEPER
          Tell her no.  Tell her it's just a big
          bird.

     The peeper starts flapping his arms and making bird noises.
     We SEE Scottie with his sling shot.  The mother nods yes.  He
     shoots it.  It hits the peeper square in the head.  He falls
     to the ground with a thud.

                    PEEPER (CONT'D)
          Mrs. Dunleavy, please come help me.  And
          wear your bikini.

     The peeper looks up.  He sees Scottie pushing a television
     out the window.  It lands on top of the peeper.  He's dead.

                            HARD CUT:

     INT. HOLE - DAY

     The peeper is zooming down a hole, walls of dirt racing by on
     all sides.

     The peeper is falling down, down, down.  The whole way
     screaming like a five-year old girl.

     PEEPER'S POV

     We see the tunnel turn into more of a slide now and the
     peeper races towards the opening which is lit by fire.  He
     SCREAMS.

     EXT. FIRE GATES OF HELL

     We see the GATE/WALL OF FLAMES.  We hear screaming.  Wham!
     We see the peeper come flying through the flames and land in
     a heap in a shallow pit of coals.

     Dazed, he stands and we see other people shooting through the
     fire wall at different levels.  (NOTE: All the arrivals
     clothes are now burned & shredded).

                    GATEKEEPER (O.S.)
          Welcome!

     The peeper looks left to see the GATEKEEPER standing at his
     station greeting the new SOULS with mock cheer.

                    PEEPER
          Am I in hell?

                    GATEKEEPER
          What do you think?

     A GIANT BIRD appears and bites the peeper's crotch area.  We
     leave the peeper in the pit and tilt up to...

     MATTE PAINTING HELL

     MUSIC UP: "RUNNING WITH THE DEVIL" BY VAN HALEN

     The VAST and insane kingdom of Hell.  A road leads toward it
     like the yellow brick road only with fire and coals.  We see
     the black castle in the distance.  The camera zooms into the
     castle, to one particular window.

     INT. NICKY'S ROOM - DAY

     Looks like an American teenager's room - models, a dresser,
     heavy metal posters (tons of OZZY stuff) everywhere (but no
     bed - Devils don't sleep).  Nicky is air guitaring to the
     song.  Over at the stereo, we see the cassette playing titled
     "NICKY'S MONSTER METAL MIX."

     The head demon, JIMMY THE DEMON, opens the door, scaring
     NICKY who falls backward into the table, breaking it.

                    NICKY
               (embarrassed)
          Hey...

                    JIMMY THE DEMON
          Your father wants to see you and your
          brothers in the throne room.

                    NICKY
          Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is
          rockin', don't forget the knockin'!

     INT. BLACK PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY

     ADRIAN and CASSIUS are playing darts.  They're aiming for
     people's faces that are coming through the wall.

                    CASSIUS
          I knew it.  He's finally retiring.

                    ADRIAN
          I've been waiting on this day for ten
          thousand years.

     He throws a dart that hits one of the heads in the forehead.

                    HUMAN DARTBOARD
          Aaaah!

                    CASSIUS
          If the old man picks me to take over
          Hell, I'll keep the torture going twenty
          four seven.  No breaks.

                    ADRIAN
          Well Dad says it's the breaks that make
          the torture.  You have to let people
          feel a sense of relief.

     Cassius whips a dart which hits one of the HUMAN DARTBOARDS
     in the eye.

                    HUMAN DARTBOARD
          Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

                    ADRIAN
          Then again, the beauty of Dad retiring
          is what he says doesn't matter anymore.

     Cassius pulls out the dart.  The eye comes with it.

                    CASSIUS
          I'll take that.

     Cassius throws the eye on the ground and stomps it.  THWACK!
     It splatters like a grape.

                    HUMAN DARTBOARD
          Was that really necessary?

     Nicky enters sheepishly.

                    CASSIUS
          Hey, how's Daddy's little girl doing
          today?

                    NICKY
          Good, thanks.

     Cassius snaps his fingers in Nicky's face.

                    CASSIUS
          Hey. Hey. Hey.  Wanna mind wrestle?

     Cassius' eyes start glowing red.

                    NICKY
          Actually, I'll take a rain check on0

     Nicky is slammed into a nearby desk as if by an invisible
     force.

                    CASSIUS
          Got ya!

                    NICKY
               (picking up his head)
          Yes, you got me...

     Nicky's head slams back down again.

                    CASSIUS
          Got ya, again!

                    NICKY
               (picking head up)
          Got me for sure, yes...

     He grabs a lamp off the desk and cracks himself over the
     head.

                    CASSIUS
          Got ya!  Now here's the big finish...

     Nicky frowns as he finds his own right hand heading for his
     own crotch.

                    NICKY
          Oh no.  Please Cassius...

     Nicky's hand is being possessed.  It gets closer and closer
     until it latches on to Nicky's crotch.

                    NICKY (CONT'D)
          Aaaaah.

     Cassius concentrates even harder, making Nicky twist his own
     hand.  Nicky screams even louder.  Adrian smiles.  They don't
     notice that DAD, wearing a sweatsuit (and with very small
     devil horns), enters behind them.

                    DAD
          What are you boys doing?

     Cassius releases Nicky's hand.

                    NICKY
          Nothing, Dad.  Just re-arranging the
          furniture.

                    DAD
          Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out
          of your brother's mind?

                    CASSIUS
          I forgot.

                    DAD
          Maybe this will help you remember.

     Dad's eyes flash red and Cassius punches himself hard in the
     nose, sending him back against the wall and down to the
     floor.

     Dad gives Nicky a wink.  Nicky smiles.  Dad has an air of
     confidence and power.

                    DAD (CONT'D)
          Now everybody sit down.

                    NICKY
          Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying
          down my monsters of metal compilation
          tape.  I really think it's a
          masterpiece.

                    DAD
          Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.

     He leads the boys to the throne area.  We see outside the
     window the peeper staring in sexily.  Dad looks, shakes his
     head.  Just then, THE BIRD appears and attacks him.  Dad
     closes the curtains.

     Nicky, Adrian and Cassius sit on little stools at the foot of
     his throne.  Dad lights a cigarette with his finger, the tip
     of which glows red like a cigarette lighter and looks down at
     his three sons.

                    DAD (CONT'D)
          My dad, your granddad, Lucifer, was
          thrown out of Heaven by G-d and rules
          here in hell for ten thousand years.
          And after this ten thousand years had
          passed, he decided to abdicate his
          throne...

     Confused, Nicky sheepishly raises his hand.

                    DAD (CONT'D)
          ...to step aside.
               (Nicky lowers his hand)
          ...and let me become the ruler of hell.
          This, as some of you might know, is my
          ten thousandth year as Prince of
          Darkness.  So I think the time has come
          to discuss who will succeed me.

     Jimmy the Demon walks in.

                    JIMMY THE DEMON
          Knock, knock.

                    DAD
          Yes, Jimmy.

     He whispers in Dad's ear.

                    DAD (CONT'D)
          No, no, that's not what I said.  He can
          keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta
          go.

                    JIMMY THE DEMON
               (turning to leave)
          Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a
          pineapple up Hitler's ass at four
          o'clock.

     Dad nods, and Jimmy shuffles out.  Dad turns his attention
     back to his sons.

                    DAD
          This was a very difficult decision,
          because I have three wonderful sons.  I
          mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless.
          And Cassius, so strong, so tough.  And
          Nicky, so...so...

                    NICKY
          Don't worry about coming up with
          anything.  It's cool.

                    DAD
          Such a sweet boy.  But after much
          thought and careful consideration, I've
          decided that the ruler for the next ten
          thousand years is going to have to
          be...me.

                    CASSIUS AND ADRIAN
               (dumbfounded)
          What!?

                    NICKY
          Hallelujah.

     They all look at Nicky.

                    NICKY (CONT'D)
          I mean...tough break.

                    DAD
          The important thing for the stability of
          our rule is to maintain the balance
          between good and evil.  And I don't
          think any of you are ready for that
          responsibility yet.  You need the wisdom
          that comes only with the passage of
          time.

                    CASSIUS
          Dad!  This is Hoyashit.

     Dad glares.  Cassius goes FLYING BACK.  One of the Human
     Dartboards laughs.  Cassius whips a dart and hits him in the
     tongue.  Jimmy enters and points at his watch.

                    DAD
          Right.  Right.  Send him in.
               (to the boys)
          I'm sorry, boys.  I've got to get back
          to work.

     Nicky, Cassius and Adrian start filing out.  Adrian stops.

                    ADRIAN
          You sure about this decision, Dad?

                    DAD
          I'm telling you, pal, it's the right
          thing to do.

     HITLER (in a French maid's outfit), is being brought in by
     Jimmy.  They head towards the closet.

     Inside the closet is a crate of pineapples.  Hitler picks out
     a relatively small one.  Dad shakes his head "no."  Dad walks
     over to the closet.  Hitler picks out a really big pineapple.
     Dad nods "yes."  Hitler sadly hands it to Dad.  Jimmy bends
     Hitler over and as Dad raises the fruit...

     CLOSE ON HITLER'S EYES

     As the pineapple's jammed up his ass.

                    HITLER
          Holy schnit!!

     EXT. HIGHWAY TO HELL - DAY

     Cassius and Adrian are standing by the road still flowing
     with souls.  Both are pissed.  There's a big, ugly, Bigfoot
     looking MONSTER hanging out with them, kind of nodding along.

                    CASSIUS
          You work your ass off for ten thousand
          years, hurting people, helping others
          hurt people, then you get a decision
          like that.

                    ADRIAN
          And he's dead serious.

                    CASSIUS
          It's just such a slap in the face.

     Adrian turns to the Monster.

                    ADRIAN
          Um, excuse me, we're having a private
          conversation here.

                    CASSIUS
          Yeah, get out of here!  Beat it!

     Cassius insanely snaps his fingers in the Monster's face.
     The Monster shrugs and walks off.

                    ADRIAN
          Twenty-thousand years ago, Grandpa
          Lucifer said, "It is better to rule in
          hell than serve in heaven."  Well, I'm
          getting tired of serving in Hell.  We
          need a place where we can rule.

     Cassius throws a rock at the Monster.  He yelps, then turns
     around, motioning like he's thinking about coming back.
     Cassius sees this and gets enraged.

                    CASSIUS
          Oh you wanna be a big man?  Bring it
          on!! Let's see what you got!

     The Monster, upon further reflection, throws his hands up in
     an "aw phooey" gesture and continues walking away.

                    CASSIUS (CONT'D)
          That's what I thought!

                    ADRIAN
               (to Cassius)
          Could you concentrate for five seconds?

                    CASSIUS
          I am concentrating.  Where can we rule?

                    ADRIAN
          What do you think about...Earth?

     Cassius seems to think this isn't a bad idea.

                    ADRIAN (CONT'D)
          We could create our own hell there.

                    CASSIUS
          You saying we go up there and kill
          everyone?

                    ADRIAN
          Eventually, Cassius.  But first we
          corrupt as many as we can so that when
          we do destroy them...

                    CASSIUS
          ...their damned souls will be ours.

                    ADRIAN
          It's our time, brother.

     The two look at each other.  They start running toward the
     fire wall.  Knocking souls out of their way.

                    GATEKEEPER
          Hey, what are you doing?!?

     They get closer to the fire.

                    GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
          You can't go through there.  The fire
          flows in, not out.

     They dive through the fire wall.  It FREEZES.

                    GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
          You know something?  You guys suck!  You
          really suck!

     Sirens go off.  Dogs start barking.  Lights flash.  And we
     hear the sound of DAMNED SOULS hitting the back of the
     firewall hard.

     INT. THRONE ROOM - SHORTLY AFTER

     Dad and Nicky are listening to one of Nicky's metal mix
     tapes.  We hear the end of Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb."
     Pause.  Dad exhales.

                    DAD
          Now that was an experience.  "You are
          only coming through in waves."  That
          line blows my mind every time.

                    NICKY
          Definitely.

                    DAD
          I don't care what kind of mood you're in
          at the start of that song.  When it's
          over, that mood has been altered.  Wow.
          Great shit.  What's next?

                    NICKY
          Well, I thought that after messing with
          your head, I'd give you a little kick in
          the keester.

     Hits the tape player.  "Enter Sandman" blasts.

                    DAD
          Who is this, Metal-lick-a?

                    NICKY
          Metallica, Dad.  Come on.

                    DAD
          I was just playing with you.

     Dad and Nicky dance to the song.

     INT. THRONE ROOM - LATER

     CLOSE ON DAD.

                    DAD
          I'm sorry.  After careful consideration,
          I regretfully have to decline.

     ON PERSON HE'S TALKING TO: DAN MARINO.

                    DAN
          C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one
          Superbowl ring.

                    DAD
          In exchange for eternal damnation of
          your soul?  You're too nice of a guy for
          me to want to do that to you, Mr.
          Marino.

                    DAN
          You did it for Namath.

                    DAD
          Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways.
          Just go back to Earth and enjoy your
          records and the Hall of Fame and the
          beautiful family and all that.

                    DAN
          This is bullshit, man.
               (gets up to leave)
          I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year,
          with or without you!

                    DAD
          Now you're talking.

     Dan exits.

                    NICKY
          You're a good devil, Dad.

                    DAD
          And I also happen to be a Jets fan.

     Nicky and Dad share a laugh which is interrupted by faint
     sirens.  The Gatekeeper enters in a hurry and falls to his
     knees.

                    GATEKEEPER
          Your highness, Cassius and Adrian have
          escaped from hell.  They went through
          the fire, and they broke it.  I think
          they took the New York tunnel.  I tried
          to stop them, but they overpowered me,
          sir.

                    DAD
          Oh, boy.  Oh boy.  Calm down.  Get off
          your knees.

     The Gatekeeper stands up.

                    GATEKEEPER
          Thanks for being so understanding, your
          worship.  You're the man.  You've always
          been the man.

     Dad's EYES GLOW RED as the Gatekeeper stands up.  Two huge
     boobs grow out of either side of the Gatekeeper's head.  We
     only see them from the front for a second.
     From behind the gatekeeper, we see the boobs but not the
     nipples as he talks to Nicky.

                    GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
               (to Nicky)
          I'm lucky to get away with just the head
          boobs, right?

                    NICKY
          Coulda been much worse.

                    GATEKEEPER
          That's what I'm thinkin'...

     Dad is staring off.  He looks shaken.

                    DAD
          This is bad, Nicky.

                    NICKY
          How bad?

                    DAD
          I'm gonna die, Nicky.  If the gates are
          broken, no new souls can get in, which
          means I'll start to deteriorate into
          nothing.

     GRANDPA LUCIFER enters.

                    LUCIFER
          What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?

                    DAD
          Everything's fine, pop.

                    LUCIFER
          Last time you said that the renaissance
          happened.

                    DAD
          Please, pop, just go back to your room.

                    LUCIFER
               (regarding gateskeeper)
          Can I take him with me and have sex with
          his head?

                    DAD
          Sure, pop.  Whatever you want.

     The gatekeeper walks towards Lucifer.

                    GATEKEEPER
          Oh, this is gonna be a whole new
          lifestyle for me, isn't it.

     EXT. GATES OF HELL - SHORTLY AFTER

     We see the coals are cooling down on the road and the DAMNED
     SOULS in hell are sneaking off.

     The DEMONS are baffled and don't quite know what to do.

     Dad, Jimmy and Nicky walk to the frozen fire.

                    DAMNED SOULS (O.S.)
          What's going on?  Where are we?

     We keep HEARING people hit behind the frozen fire with loud
     thuds.

                    JIMMY THE DEMON
          Nothing's getting through that.  The
          fire is solid as a rock.

                    NICKY
          We gotta get this bad boy burning again.
          Ideas?

                    DAD
          To do that Cassius and Adrian have to
          come back through the other way.

                    NICKY
          So go get 'em, Dad!

                    DAD
          I'm too weak.  The process has already
          begun.

     Dad holds up his hand.  His pink is hanging by a thread.  We
     see the bigfoot MONSTER grunt disgusted by the sight.

                    NICKY
          So go get 'em, Jimmy!

                    JIMMY THE DEMON
          I'm just a demon, Nicky.  I don't got
          devil blood in me.  I'd last two minutes
          up there with your brothers.

                    NICKY
          You're not saying it's up to me?

     The MONSTER puts his hands over his eyes shaking his head as
     if to say, "oh no."

                    NICKY (CONT'D)
          I've never been to Earth.  I've never
          even slept over at some other dude's
          house!

                    JIMMY THE DEMON
          You're the spawn of Satan.  You got it
          in you.

                    DAD
          Nicky, the worst thing that could happen
          on Earth is you get killed, in which
          case, boom, you end up back here.

                    NICKY
          Are you telling me I have to go to Earth
          and kill my brothers?

                    JIMMY THE DEMON
          Not go.  They left together at the exact
          same time.  They gotta come back
          together at the exact same time.

     Dad takes an ornate flask from his robe.

                    DAD
          Here.  Get them drunk from this.  One
          sip and they'll be trapped inside.  Once
          you've got both of them, you bring the
          flask back through the gate.

     Dad's pinky is hanging.  Jimmy pulls it off and examines it.
     The Monster gags.

                    JIMMY THE DEMON
          Your ol' man's got less than a week.

     Nicky looks petrified.

                    NICKY
          No.  This can't be happening.

                    DAD
          Son, just do your best.

     Nicky looks teary eyed.  The moment is broken by the Monster,
     who runs in and pushes Nicky through the fire.

     Nicky goes through the solid fire wall.  PAUSE.  The Monster
     taps his own wrist and looks at Dad as if to say, "gotta get
     a move on."

     INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAY

     A SIGN: 42ND ST. GRAND CENTRAL

     PAN DOWN to the darkened bowels of the old station, between
     two tracks, to a putrid puddle.  Nicky breaks through the
     surface, sputtering.  We hear a rumbling in the near
     distance.

                    NICKY
          Okay. Earth.  The Blue Marble.  This
          doesn't look too bad.

     Nicky sees a fast approaching light, furrows his brow and
     WHAMMM!

               EXT. GATES OF HELL - MOMENTS LATER

     Nicky comes shooting through the solid fire wall and lands in
     the coal pit.  His Dad limps back to him.

                    JIMMY THE DEMON
          You were gone ten seconds.  What
          happened?

                    NICKY
          I got hit by a big light that was
          attached to a lot of metal.

                    DAD
          That's a train, son.  Don't stand in
          front of them.

                    NICKY
          Well, I guess I'm going to have to take
          a mulligan on this one.

                    DAD
          Please, Nicky, get back up there.
               (his ear falls off)
          Try to hurry.

     Nicky climbs up and heads back toward the fire wall.

     INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAY

     Nicky makes it back through the hole.  Looks both ways and
     hops out of the hole.  He carefully crosses the tracks and is
     stopped by the sight of a bulldog, BEEFY, on the other side.
     In his mouth is one of those signs car service drivers use to
     identify their passengers at the airport.  On the sign is
     scrawled "NICKY."

     Nicky and Beefy stare at each other a beat.

                    NICKY
          I'm Nicky.

     Beefy drops the sign from his mouth.

                    BEEFY
               (voice of Sandy Wernick)
          Hey, terrific!!  Now get off the track
          and come with me, shitstains.

     INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - PAVILLION - DAY

     The throng of commuters making their way through the terminal
     are giving a wide berth to the filthy man who's looking
     around suspiciously, talking to the dog.

                    BEEFY
          My name's Beefy.  I'm an old friend of
          your father's.  He's asked me to help
          you out.

                    NICKY
          I just need to find my brothers and be
          on my way, Beefy.

                    BEEFY
          It's not gonna be easy.  Your brothers
          can possess people.  So they probably
          won't look like themselves.  You have to
          be suspicious of everyone.

     Nicky looks at Beefy warily for a beat.

                    NICKY
          Okay, "bro," this jig is up...
               (pulling out the flask)
          Just get in the bottle.  Just slide
          right on in there.

                    BEEFY
          It's not me, moron.

                    NICKY
          Oh.  Sorry.

     EXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY

     A BLIND PREACHER rants outside the entrance.  People put
     money in his pot.

                    PREACHER
          Oh how the Lord loves you.  All his
          children.
               (passerby puts in money)
          He thanks you for your kindness.
               (another woman puts in money)
          God bless, Ma'am.  The Lord loves you...
          The Lord loves you...

     We see Nicky and Beefy walk up from behind.  The PREACHER
     sniffs.

                    PREACHER (CONT'D)
          The Lord does not love you.  I
          sense...pure evil.
               (thrusts his cross in Nicky's
             face)
          You make the Lord very nervous.
               (feeling hot)
          I'm burning...ahhh.
               (running away)
          The Devil walks among us!

     He runs off screaming, wildly bumping into people.

                    PREACHER (CONT'D)
          Oh Lord, save us from Hell's beast!

     He gets off course and runs right into a subway entrance.  He
     disappears.  Beefy turns to Nicky.

                    BEEFY
          Makin' friends already.

                    NICKY
               (shivering a little)
          It's freezing up here, Beefy.

                    BEEFY
          You're on Earth now, kid.  Gonna have
          the same physical needs and limitations
          a human has.  We'll stop by K-mart.  Get
          you some warm clothes.

                    NICKY
          I also have this odd pain in my mid
          section.  Kind of a hollow feeling...

                    BEEFY
          That pain is hunger.

     EXT. BENCH - DAY

     K-mart bag is next to a bench.  PAN UP to see Nicky wearing
     an extra warm SKI OUTFIT.  Sitting next to him on the bench
     is Beefy.  Between them is a big bucket of POPEYE'S FRIED
     CHICKEN.  Nicky takes out a drumstick.

                    NICKY
          So far, so good.  Now what?

                    BEEFY
          Put it in your mouth.

     Nicky puts it in his mouth.  Holds it there.

                    BEEFY (CONT'D)
          Move your teeth up and down.

     Nicky does.  He chews for a long time.

                    BEEFY (CONT'D)
          Now you gotta swallow it.  Tilt your
          head back and let the meat slide down
          your throat-hole.

     Nicky does.  He gets a looks of complete joy on his face.

                    NICKY
          Hey...Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!

                    BEEFY
          It sure is.  Now eat it up.  You're
          gonna need your energy.

                    NICKY
          I got energy up the ying-ying.  Let's
          get cracking!

     NICKY stands with a drumstick and jogs off the curb right
     into the path of a moving bus.

     INT. GATES OF HELL - MOMENTS LATER

     The Monster is rubbing the gatekeeper's boobs.  The
     gatekeeper is wearing a modified bra.  He seems to be
     enjoying it.  We hear a THUD.  They look down to see Nicky on
     the ground.  (We didn't see him flying through this time.)

     The Monster and Gatekeeper immediately stop.  Kind of
     embarrassed.

                    GATEKEEPER
          Hey.

                    NICKY
          That's a pretty brassiere.

                    GATEKEEPER
          Thanks.

                    NICKY
          Could you maybe not tell anyone about
          this?

                    GATEKEEPER
          You got it.  Could you maybe not tell
          anyone about this?

                    NICKY
          You got it.

     Nicky turns and walks toward the firewall.  As soon as his
     back is turned, the monster pantomimes to the Gatekeeper, "I
     love your boobs."  The Gatekeeper gives a flirtatious laugh
     (we don't see him morph back through the wall here.).

     EXT. VILLAGE STREET - DAY

     Beefy is walking with him down the street.  Nicky is crazy
     cautious.

                    NICKY
          From now on.  I'm just going to avoid
          all moving metal objects.

                    BEEFY
          Great.  Now your father gave me some
          deposit money for a nice pad on the
          Upper East Side.  But I misplaced it.

                      FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT

     Beefy is sitting on a bench/booth at a strip club.  Champagne
     is on the table.  Bills in his mouth.  We see THREE DANCERS
     dancing for him.

                      FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. VILLAGE STREET

     Nicky and Beefy.

                    BEEFY
          So I found this other joint for you.
          But you're gonna have a roommate.

     INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

     A scruffy, thirtyish buy, TODD (Allen Covert), is on the
     phone in his small, bohemian apartment in the Village.

                    TODD
               (on phone)
          I know exactly how you feel... The night
          Reagan was elected, I said to my mother,
          "Is this man going to blow up the world,
          Mommy?"  Then we both cried for like an
          hour.
               (knock at the door)
          Somebody's here.  Call you later.

     Todd gets up and opens the door.  It's Nicky, with Beefy by
     his side.  Nicky is nervous, and his speech sounds practiced.

                    NICKY
          Hello, friend, my name is Nicky.  I
          understand you're seeking a roommate, as
          per your advertisement in the Village
          Voice.  Would it be possible for me to
          fill the slot?

                    TODD
          Uh, don't you want to know what the rent
          is?

     Nicky looks down at Beefy.  Beefy looks up at Nicky.  Both
     nod imperceptibly.

                    NICKY
          Yes.  What is rent?

                    TODD
          Eight-hundred, split down the middle.
          Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with
          my scene partner so the living room will
          be off limits.

                    NICKY
          Off limits.

                    TODD
          Right.  And as far as household items:
          we can share the soap, but we'll split
          the cost 60/40.
          Cause the person who physically goes out
          and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay
          as much as the other guy.
               (looks at Nicky)
          Aren't you boiling in that outfit?

                    NICKY
          No.

                    TODD
          It's like eighty degrees in this
          hallway.  You from the South?

                    NICKY
          Yeah.  The deep South.

     Nicky laughs a little too hard.

                    TODD
          Why is that funny?

                    NICKY
          I don't know.

                    TODD
          And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.

     Todd turns and goes into the apartment.

                    BEEFY
          You'll be alright.  Go on.  Big day
          tomorrow.  Don't forget to do that sleep
          thing I told you about.

                    NICKY
          Got ya.
               (to Todd)
          Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?

                    TODD
          Yeah, your bedroom is right over there.

     The door closes.  Beefy looks down at the welcome mat.  It
     reads: I "heart" METHOD ACTING.  Beefy raises his leg over
     it.

     INT. NICKY'S ROOM

     Nicky is sleeping on top of the hissing radiator, fully
     clothed.  When he inhales through his nose, we hear that
     familiar snoring/snorting sound.  But when he exhales, we
     hear disturbing "speaking-in-tongues", Exorcist-style voices.

     SLOW PAN across the room to the doorway where Todd stands,
     looking concerned.

     EXT. CATHEDRAL - MORNING

     We HEAR the bells toll.  We see the beautiful exterior of a
     large church.

     INT. CATHEDRAL

     CLOSE ON an ELDERLY, kind looking CARDINAL.  He ascends the
     steps to the pulpit and looks out on his large congregation.
     We see that TV cameras are covering the SUNDAY service.  He
     gins his homily.

                    CARDINAL
          In today's gospel, the Lord tells us who
          we are to live if we wish to attain the
          splendor of Heaven... or something like
          that.  Jesus sure says a lot of stuff in
          the Bible.  Moses this.  Moses that.
          Abraham hit me with a whiffle ball bat.

     The crowd stares dumbfounded.  We see that the Cardinal is
     standing on a steaming hot pizza which is still in the box
     with the top open.

                    CARDINAL (CONT'D)
          Yep, the Lord sure did say a bunch of
          hibbity-jibbity.  But has he ever really
          done anything for us?  Has he ever put a
          Jaguar XJR in my driveway?  Has he ever
          given any of my enemies the herpes?  No.
          He hasn't done a damn thing for any of
          us.

     A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN stands up.

                    MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
          The Lord gave my son the strength to get
          off drugs.

                    CARDINAL
          Ma'am, I know your son, and believe me,
          he was better off on drugs.  He's a
          bore.  At least when he was smoking
          hashish, he made me laugh occasionally.

     A YOUNG MAN and his PREGNANT WIFE stand up.

                    YOUNG MAN
          After we tried for many years, the Lord
          finally helped my wife conceive a baby.

                    CARDINAL
          No, your best friend Fitzie helped your
          wife conceive a baby.  He helped her
          conceive it all night long.

     Fitzie, who's sitting on the other side of the Wife, starts
     to "raise the roof."  Then thinks better of it.  The Cardinal
     points to a well-dressed man in the front pew.

                    CARDINAL (CONT'D)
          How about you, Mr. Mayor?  The Lord ever
          do anything for you?

     The Mayor has tinfoil on his feet.

                    MAYOR
               (standing)
          Well, I wish I could think of something,
          Cardinal, but to be honest with you, I
          can't.  Kind of makes you wonder if
          there even is a Lord.  If there is any
          ultimate punishment for our so-called
          "sins."  Maybe we should all just have
          fun and do whatever the hell we want.

     A hubbub is raised by the crowd.  Fitzie raises the roof
     again, this time energetically.

                    CARDINAL
          Amen to that.  Let the sin begin!

     The hubbub grows to a roar.  Several PEOPLE start fighting
     over the money in the collection plate.

     The Cardinal smiles knowingly at the Mayor.  We hear the
     Cardinal's thoughts - in Adrian's voice.

                    ADRIAN (O.S.)
          Oh, this is delicious.

     ON MAYOR

     He's smirking.  WE HEAR his telepathic response.

                    CASSIUS (O.S.)
               (laughing)
          "Let the sin begins" - that was a good
          one.

                    ADRIAN (O.S.)
          Well, we must get people sinning if we
          want to fill up our New Hell.  How are
          things going down at City Hall?

                    CASSIUS (O.S.)
          I lowered the drinking age to ten.

                    ADRIAN (O.S.)
          Brilliant.  This is so much fun.  I
          never want it to end.

                    CASSIUS (O.S.)
          Why should it end?  Who's gonna stop us?

     The Mayor/Cassius laughs.  As he does, his eyes slowly cross.

     EXT. STREET - DAY

     Beefy is taking a dump on the sidewalk.  PAN OVER TO:

     Nicky, his pants around his ankles.  He's trying to do the
     same.

                    NICKY
          This is intense!  And it happens every
          day?  Sometimes twice?  I gotta tip my
          hat to you people!

                    BEEFY
          Look, it's okay for me to shit the
          street.  But you gotta use a toilet.

                    NICKY
               (pulling up pants)
          Okay, just point me in the right
          direction next time.

                    BEEFY
          Come on, there's like ten million people
          in this city and the clock is ticking.

                    NICKY
          Well, let's rock and roll.

     Nicky looks at the next person walking by.  It's a CHINESE
     DELIVERY GUY on a bicycle.  Nicky clotheslines him, taking
     him off the bike in a sleeperhold/headlock.

                    NICKY (CONT'D)
          Get in the bottle.  Dad's falling apart.
          You froze the gate and you're killing
          him.  Drink!

     Nicky puts the flask to the Chinese Guy's lips.

                    CHINESE DELIVERY GUY
          I'm not thirsty!  I'm not thirsty!

                    NICKY
          just get in the flask!

     The Chinese Guy breaks loose, gives Nicky a roundhouse kick
     to the head and runs away.  Nicky gets up.

                    NICKY (CONT'D)
          Adrian and Cassius!  You think a kick to
          the head is gonna make me throw in the
          towel?  Well, in the immortal words of
          Judas Priest, "You got another thing
          comin'."

     Beefy shakes his dog head and sighs as we see Nicky hold the
     bottle up to a few more PEDESTRIANS.

     EXT. STREET - DAY

     Nicky approaches various people as they pass.  (To be shot
     long lense, real people, real reactions.)

     INT. POPEYE'S - DAY

     Nicky gets to the front of the line and tries to get the
     Cashier to drink.  The Cashier yanks his head away and gives
     Nicky a dirty look.  Nicky shrugs and points to the menu,
     ordering some chicken.

     EXT. STREET - DAY

     nicky walks up to a homeless man.  He thrusts the bottle in
     his face.  To Nicky's surprise, the homeless man gladly takes
     it and drinks.  Nothing happens.  Nicky is baffled.  He tries
     to take the flask back, but the man won't let go.  Finally he
     grabs it away from him.  The man starts throwing garbage at
     Nicky as he walks away.

     INT. CENTRAL PARK ZOO - DAY

     Beefy is looking around for Nicky.  He spots him - inside the
     polar bear cage.  Nicky approaches the bear holding the
     flask.

     INT. HELL - MOMENTS LATER

     Nicky shoots through the firewall, having been killed again.
     The Gatekeeper is wearing tassels on his boobs.

                    GATEKEEPER
          Bus?

                    NICKY
          Beast.

     The Monster laughs.

                    GATEKEEPER
               (to Monster)
          You like that?  You think that's funny?

     The Gatekeeper swirls his tassels.

                    GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
          How about that?  You like that?

     The Monster howls with delight.

     EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

     Nicky sits on the rocks, beaten and exhausted, eating a
     Popeye's drumstick.

                    NICKY
          All that running and chasing is making
          the sleep thing want to come early.

                    BEEFY
          I think we have to work on narrowing
          down our list of suspects.  Now I'm
          going to go check in with some of my
          contacts uptown.

     Beefy hears Nicky's strange terrible snores.  He's asleep.
     Beefy sighs.

                    BEEFY (CONT'D)
          Kid's got a lot of evil in him, just
          begging to come out...

     Beefy walks away.

     EXT. VARIOUS CENTRAL PARK LOCATIONS - DAY

     Nicky snores.  Masses of birds fly out of the trees.  Nicky
     snores.  Squirrels run out of trees.  Nicky snores.

     ON WORRIED PEOPLE

     Staring at Nicky who continues to snore.  Two HEAVY-METAL
     GUYS, JOHN AND PETER, are listening to Danzig and doing a
     goofy dance.  They hear something and turn the music down:
     it's the distant sound of Nicky's snore.

                    PETER
          Sounds like our devil dance actually
          worked this time.

                    JOHN
          'Bout time...

     Nicky snores.  It sounds like "I will eat your hearts."  The
     worried people run away.  Nicky snores.  Children on the
     Carousel, going real fast, upset.  Nicky snores.

     Peter and John walk over to a position near Nicky's bench.

                    JOHN (CONT'D)
          There's our man.

                    PETER
          Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties
          to the dark side.

     A sleazy STREET VENDOR shuffles over towards Nicky.  He eyes
     the flask which is half hanging out of Nicky's pocket.

                    JOHN
          What's with that guy?

                    PETER
          Gotta be one of his disciples or
          something.

     Suddenly, the Vendor grabs the flask (and Nicky's half-eaten
     drumstick) and runs off.

                    JOHN
          Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got
          ripped off.

                    PETER
          Should we wake him up?

                    JOHN
          Yeah.  You do it.

     Peter gets up and shakes Nicky who comes to with a loud
     SNORT.

                    PETER
          Rise and shine, devil guy.  Some dude
          just stole your shit.

     Nicky feels for the flask.  It's gone.

                    NICKY
          Oh nooooo....

     Fire shoots out of Nicky's mouth.

                    NICKY (CONT'D)
          Which way did he go?

                    JOHN
          That way.

     Nicky is about to run off.  Looks at John's shirt.

                    NICKY
          Iron Maiden live double disc is simply
          phenomenal.

     He runs off.

                    PETER
          Did you check out the dragon mouth?

                    JOHN
          The Dark Prince is here.

     EXT. SIDE STREET - DAY

     Nicky is searching the street for his flask.  He walks past
     several STREET VENDORS who have set up their wares on the
     sidewalk.  PAUSE.  Nicky comes walking back into frame as he
     sees his flask (and half-eaten drumstick) laying on the
     blanket of the VENDOR.

                    NICKY
          Hey...

                    STREET VENDOR
          See something you like, my man?

                    NICKY
          Yes.  I would like my flask back.

     The street vendor stands, very angry.

                    STREET VENDOR
          You callin' me a thief, my man?

                    NICKY
          No, I'm just calling you... a guy who
          has my flask.

                    STREET VENDOR
          And if that is your so-called "flask,"
          how would I have it unless I was, in
          fact, a thief?

                    NICKY
               (not sure what the answer is)
          I don't know?

     A YUPPIE JOGGER is checking out the flask.

                    MAN
          Yeah, how much for the silver flask
          there?

                    STREET VENDOR
          Well, that's a very special item.  The
          cap itself is one hundred percent
          plappium.  It's a value is over three
          thousand dollars.

                    MAN
          Really.  Where's it from?

                    NICKY
          It was handcrafted in hell by Satan
          himself and is only to be used for the
          capture and containment of my blood
          brothers so that the firefall of Hades
          will burn brightly once again.

                    MAN
          Really.  I think we'll let you keep it
          then.

     He walks away.

                    STREET VENDOR
          Okay, now you gone and done it.  You
          done messed with my business bitch!

                    NICKY
          Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise
          your voice.  It's making my muscles
          tighten.

     We see that Nicky's eyes are starting to glow red.

                    STREET VENDOR
          Oh, you gonna go all crazy eyes on me?
          I'll show you some crazy eyes.  Let's
          get busy.

     The vendor makes an even crazier face at Nicky and starts
     swinging his fists around.

     Nearby, VALERIE, an unsure, sweetly unstylish young woman, is
     selling clothes off a spread out blanket.  She notices what's
     going on.

     Nicky's eyes widen in panic.  Just then, Valerie steps in.

                    VALERIE
          Excuse me, does that flask belong to
          this man?

                    STREET VENDOR
               (frustrated)
          Now you callin' me a thief?  Damn.

                    VALERIE
          Look, I know you come out here and sell
          stolen stuff all the time.  But today,
          the guy you stole from just happened to
          walk by and bust you.  So why don't you
          admit today's not your day and give him
          his flask back?

                    STREET VENDOR
          Or what're you gonna do about it?  Ugly
          me to death?

                    VALERIE
          No, but maybe that cop over there might
          have something to say.

     Valerie points to a cop across the street.  The Street Vendor
     ponders this for a second, then...

                    STREET VENDOR
          Aw, take your dumb-ass canteen, goofy.
               (looking at Valerie)
          And you, take your raggedy-ass clothes
          and find a new corner.  Before I show
          you what real crazy is.

     The vendor does crazy eyes again.

                    VALERIE
          Fine.  I will.

     Nicky picks up the flask and the drumstick.

                    NICKY
          Hey, mister.  I'll be seeing you in a
          few years.

     Valerie gathers her blanket, starts walking away and Nicky
     follows her.

                    NICKY (CONT'D)
          That was amazing.  Thanks so much.  You
          didn't have to do that.

                    VALERIE
          That's okay.  I get messed with all the
          time and when I saw him doing that to
          you I just lost it.  I hate when people
          take advantage of tourists.  It ruins it
          for the rest of us.

                    NICKY
          You think I'm a tourist?

                    VALERIE
          I'm sorry.  I just assumed.  Your accent
          maybe.  Where are you from?

                    NICKY
          The South.

                    VALERIE
          Really?

                    NICKY
          Yeah.  Deep south.
               (laughs hard)

     She laughs along with him, not sure why.

                    VALERIE
          Why are you laughing?

                    NICKY
          I don't know, but I like it.  Say.  Your
          glasses are nice.  They make your eyes
          look sparkly and big.  It's fun to look
          at them.

                    VALERIE
          My dad's an optometrist.

                    NICKY
          My dad's in hell, and he's falling
          apart.

                    VALERIE
          I'm sorry.  It's really tough when your
          parents get older.

                    NICKY
          If I don't save him, I don't know what
          I'm gonna do.

                    VALERIE
          Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like
          you will figure something out.

     Nicky is experiencing new sensations as he looks at her.  He
     hands her the half-eaten drumstick.

                    NICKY
          Here, have a Popeye's.  This drumstick
          ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.

                    VALERIE
          That's alright.  I already ate lunch.  I
          actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.

                    NICKY
          Could I come with you to getting a
          Gelati?

                    VALERIE
          If you want to.

                    NICKY
          Want to?  A million angry octopus people
          couldn't hold me back!

                    VALERIE
          "Octopus people?"

                    NICKY
          Uh, it's a deep south expression.

     Nicky laughs.

     EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

     They exit the ice cream store, eating Gelati.

                    NICKY
          It's freezing my hands.

                    VALERIE
          It's not that cold.  Here, let me wrap
          it.

     Valerie takes a few napkins and wraps it for Nicky.  Just
     then the PREACHER walks by.  He quickly turns his head,
     sensing Nicky.

                    PREACHER
          Why do you taunt me with your darkness?!
          Your evil is stinking up our streets!
          We're all gonna die!

     He takes off running right into a lamp post.

                    VALERIE
          This town is really going to hell
          lately.
               (Nicky nods)
          So what part of the city do you live in?

                    NICKY
          I have an apartment.  I don't remember
          exactly where.  My dog knows, though.

                    VALERIE
               (laughs)
          You have a dog?  What kind?

                    NICKY
          I'm not sure.  I'd ask him, but he's
          uptown talking to his contacts.

     EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY

     Beefy is screwing a female dog from behind.

                    BEEFY
          Remember, it's not the size of the boat,
          it's the motion of the ocean.

                    GIRL DOG
          Just finish.

     EXT. STREET - VALERIE & NICKY CONTINUOUS - DAY

                    VALERIE
          I'd love to have a dog.  But I go to
          school full time.  It wouldn't be fair
          to the dog.

                    NICKY
          School?

                    VALERIE
          Parsons School of Design.  I knew
          growing up I wasn't much to look at, so
          I put my energy into making things that
          are pretty.

                    NICKY
          What's that pleasant smell coming from,
          your skin?

                    VALERIE
          My perfume?

     He takes her wrist to his nose.  He stares at it, licks it.

                    VALERIE (CONT'D)
               (laughs)
          It's called "Comptoir Sud Pacific."
          Which I think is the French word for
          coconuts.

     Nicky stops and looks at her.

                    NICKY
          Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch
          of butterflies flapping around in my
          stomach.  Is that normal?

                    VALERIE
          Sometimes, sure.

                    NICKY
          Good.  I was concerned.

     EXT. GATES OF HELL - DAY

     The Gatekeeper is near the frozen fall.  We hear loud
     wailing, moaning, etc., coming from the other side.

                    GATEKEEPER
          Doesn't sound very good behind there.  I
          hope Nicky's kicking some ass on Earth.

     The Monster is smoking a cigarette and wearing a leather
     biker's hat.  He nods along in agreement.

     PAN TO LUCIFER

     Who's sitting over by a rock fishing in a small pool of
     fire/pond.

                    LUCIFER
          You know, I was the one who created
          Hell.

                    GATEKEEPER
          I know, your wickedness.

                    LUCIFER
          I started slow, though.  For years, I
          was just giving people hot foots.
          Actually, you can give all the credit
          for Hell to my first wife; she was the
          inspiration.  She was an ugly one, too.
          One day, she asked me if I wanted super
          sex.  I said I'll take the soup.

     The Monster laughs really hard.

                    LUCIFER (CONT'D)
          Take it easy there, Chewbacca.  In fact,
          you look like her mother, except she had
          more hair.

     The Monster laughs even harder.

                    LUCIFER (CONT'D)
          You know what was in Hell when I came
          down here, Cassius?

                    GATEKEEPER
          It's Stanley, sir.

                    LUCIFER
          Nothing.  No mountains.  No castles.
          Looked like a giant parking lot.  It
          wasn't even called Hell.

                    GATEKEEPER
          What was it called, sir.

                    LUCIFER
          Boogerland!

                    GATEKEEPER
          That's nice, Grandpa.  Why don't you
          just enjoy the fishing?

                    LUCIFER
          I can't enjoy anything.  I go fishing.
          I catch nothing.  I go to orgies, I
          catch everything...

     We hear the Monster laughing again as we PAN DOWN Grandpa's
     fishing line to:

     EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

     We SEE a MINIATURE PEEPER squirming on the fish hook.  A
     giant fanged fish engulfs the Peeper's body.  Only his head
     is sticking out.

                    PEEPER
          I deserve this!

     EXT. BAR - DOWN THE STREET - DAY

     Several ELEVEN YEAR-OLDS stumble out, drunk.

                    KID
          I just stole twenty-five bucks off the
          bar.

                    KID #2
          How many beers did you have?

                    KID # 3
          Eight sips.

                    KID
          I had five!  I'm so wasted.

     They both high five, throw up and fall.  PAN over to ADRIAN
     sitting on top of a mailbox laughing as he sips from a bottle
     of PEPPERMINT SCHNAPPS.

                    ADRIAN
          When an adult goes to Hell, that's
          terrific.  But when a child goes...
          that's why I'm in this business.

     Adrian looks across the street and sees Nicky walking with
     Valerie.  He's shocked.

     Valerie is holding up a pair of drawstring pants from her
     collection.

                    NICKY
          So you're saying, make all pants with a
          drawstring, then heavier set gals don't
          have to feel humiliated by telling their
          waist size in front of the whole store?

                    VALERIE
          Basically, yeah.

                    NICKY
          Wow.  Maybe you should make drawstring
          socks for gals with fat ankles.

     Valerie laughs.

                    VALERIE
          You know what's nice about you?  You
          just seem happy being yourself.  You
          don't try to act cool.

                    NICKY
          Thanks much.  You know what's nice about
          you, Valerie?

                    VALERIE
          What?

     Up the street, Adrian's eyes redden.  NICKY looks like he's
     been stunned by something.

                    NICKY
          Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.

                    VALERIE
          What was that?

                    NICKY
               (shocked and confused)
          I...I don't know why I just said that.
          I meant to say that...

                          QUICK CUT TO:

     Adrian's eyes flashing.

                    NICKY (CONT'D)
          ...I've always wanted to have sex with a
          gross pig.  What do you say we go behind
          that dumpster, pull our pants down and
          see what happens?

     Valerie's very hurt.

                    VALERIE
          You're a jerk.

     She turns and walks away.  Nicky looks over and sees Adrian.
     His inner voice speaks to him.

                    NICKY (O.S.)
          ADRIAN!

                    ADRIAN (O.S.)
          You shouldn't have come here.

                    NICKY (O.S.)
          Please, get out of my mind!

     Adrian's eyes flash.

                    NICKY (CONT'D)
          Hey, Valerie!

     She stops and turns.  Nicky RAISES his fist to resist
     Adrian's force.  It's too much.  His middle finger comes up,
     giving her the "finger."

                    VALERIE
          What the hell's your problem?

     She runs away crying.  Nicky turns to Adrian who's still
     across the street.

                    NICKY (O.S.)
          Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell.
          Dad's sick.

                    ADRIAN (O.S.)
          He's sick?

                    NICKY (O.S.)
          Yeah, he needs souls to live.  When you
          guys left, you broke the gates.  We
          gotta get the gates burning again before
          he dies.

     Adrian processes this.

                    ADRIAN (O.S.)
          He should have thought of that before he
          denied me my birthright.

                    NICKY (O.S.)
          Well maybe you should go back and talk
          it over with him.

                    ADRIAN (O.S.)
          How about this?  I stay here enjoying my
          Schnapps and you go back.

     Nicky's body jerks around.

                    NICKY (O.S.)
          Adrian, please...

     Nicky, fighting control over his body, walks slowly and
     crazily into the middle of the street where he sees a large
     truck bearing down on him.

     JOHN and PETER get blood splattered on them.  Peter looks
     down to see the "666" forms in blood on their clothes.

                    PETER
          Check this out.  The number of the
          beast.

     They laugh and hi-five.

                    KATHY LEE
          Oh, that's terrible, Reege...

                    REGIS

          You followed him?

                    REGIS
          I followed him all the way downtown, and
          when he gets out of the car, I reach
          under my seat and pull out an aluminum
          bat.

                    KATHY LEE
          You keep a bat under your seat?

                    REGIS
          Recently, yes!  So I run up behind this
          guy, and start bashing his brains in
          with this bat, and it made me feel
          happy!  Did you ever see THE

     Beefy turns to Nicky.

                    BEEFY
          Your brothers are upsetting the balance
          of good and evil.

                    NICKY
          What can I do about it?

                    BEEFY
          You can't do jack shit... unless you
          learn your evil powers.

                    NICKY
          Nobody's as evil as my brothers.  Those
          dudes put the wick in wicked.

                    BEEFY
          Go get a soda out of the fridge.

                    NICKY
          But those are my roommate's sodas...

                    BEEFY
               (high-pitched mocking)
          "But those are my roommate's sodas..."
          Does that sound like a statement the son
          of the devil would make?

     Nicky, ashamed, gets a Coke out of the fridge and places it
     on the coffee table.  He and Beefy sit on the couch and stare
     at the Coke.

                    BEEFY (CONT'D)
          You have the power to change the cola in
          that can into any other liquid - engine
          oil, bat's blood, moose piss.  You just
          have to release the evil within you.

                    NICKY
          Release the evil?

                    BEEFY
          I'm just saying, there's wickedness in
          you... I can tell from your snores.

     Nicky stares at the can.

                    BEEFY (CONT'D)
          Release your evil...

     Nicky frowns and bites his lip.  The can rattles a little.

     INT. BASKETBALL ARENA - DAY

                    BILL WALTON
          What an odd game, folks.  The powerhouse
          85-0 Harlem Globetrotters, who normal
          run circles around the 0-85 Nationals,
          seem to be struggling to find their
          groove in front of their hometown fans.

     A Globetrotter makes a fancy pass to another player, who
     makes a fancy pass to CORNROWS who starts doing some VINTAGE
     GLOBETROTTERS FANCY DRIBBLING.  The REF blows the whistle and
     makes the travelling signal.

                    REF
          He's walking, get him a bus!

                    BILL WALTON
          Oh, another awful call.  There is no way
          that was travelling.

     Ref takes ball from Cornrows, who gets in the Ref's face.

                    CORNROWS
          What's with all these crazy calls?  You
          gotta watch that shit, we haven't lost a
          game in 53 years.

                    REF
          Technical foul!

     Ref snaps just like Cassius in the players' face.

          It looks like the work of a brother...

          A black guy?

          If it's Cassius, yes.

     Nicky races for the door.

     INT. BASKETBALL ARENA - DAY

     As the ref taunts the crowd, a fan wearing a Globetrotter's
     shirt yells out.

          Get your head out your ass, ref!  The
          kids came to see the Globetrotters win.

                    REF
          Oh, so you wanna lip off to me?
          Unsportsmanlike conduct on the big mouth
          in the Globetrotter's shirt.  Take ten
          points off for the Globetrotters.

          In all my years of basketball, I was
          never so happy to hear a halftime
          buzzer.  Folk, I'm afraid if the second
          half doesn't get any better, I expect a
          full scale riot.

     A spotlight points to an announcer at mid-court.

          halftime half-court heave throw, where
          one lucky fan will have a shot at ten
          thousand dollars!

     A brick lands at the announcer's feet.

                    COURT ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
          And if he makes it, everyone in
          attendance today will receive a free
          pizza.

     INT. ARENA TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

     MIGUEL, wearing a big basketball jersey, looks nervous.  He
     has a pass on.

                    MIGUEL
          I ain't goin' out there and taking the
          shot.  These people have gone crazy.

                    NICKY
          I'll take the shot.

     INT. BASKETBALL ARENA STANDS - CONTINUOUS

     As Nicky runs out on the court, Peter turns to John.

                    PETER
          Look who's back from the dead.

                    JOHN
          Six, six, six, pick up sticks.

     They high-five.  The only happy fans in their section.

     INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

     Todd's baffled, looking at his roommate on TV.  Beefy is
     watching from the fire escape.

                    TODD
          What's Nicky doing down there?

                    BEEFY
          Trying to capture his brother in a flask
          and preserve the balance of good and
          evil on Earth.

     Todd looks over, suspicious.

                    TODD
          Did you just talk?

                    BEEFY
          No.

     INT. BASKETBALL ARENA - CONTINUOUS

     The court announcer covers his mic and whispers to Nicky.

                    COURT ANNOUNCER
          You better win these people some free
          pizza.  Looks like they're about to
          start killing each other.

     STANDS

     A BUSINESSMAN pushes a very old SODA GUY down an aisle of
     stairs.

     COURTSIDE

     The court announcer hands Nicky the ball.  He looks at it.

                    NICKY
          Release the evil.

     His eyes get red.  Staring at the ball, it explodes.

                    NICKY (CONT'D)
          Okay, too much evil..

     Bill Walton's hair is on fire.

                    BILL WALTON
          I think that ball just blew up.  And
          yes, my hair is aflame.

                    NICKY
               (turning to sideline)
          Could I get another ball?

     The court announcer throws out another ball.  Nicky stares at
     it again with red eyes.

                    NICKY (CONT'D)
          I command you not to blow up and go into
          that metal circle.

     Nicky throws an underhand shot.  The ball arcs through the
     air and is about to go in when the ref comes out of nowhere
     and swats it away.

                    REF
          Get that crap outta here!

     The crowd BOOS!  Nicky and the ref stare at each other.

                    NICKY (O.S.)
          I know you're having fun, Cassius, but
          you gotta come back to Hell.

                    CASSIUS (O.S.)
          Look around you, Nicky.  We're in Hell.
          The New Hell.

     STANDS

     We see FITZIE, sitting between TWO PREGNANT WOMEN, raising
     the roof.

     COURTSIDE

     As the crowd BOOS, Nicky runs over and grabs the microphone.

                    NICKY
          Listen up, New York.  Your souls are in
          great danger...

     Nicky gets hit by a hot dog.

                    NICKY (CONT'D)
          Alright, how about this?  I get one more
          shot.  The ref will cover me.  I miss
          it, the Globetrotters forfeit the game.
          I make it, he doesn't ref the second
          half and we all start conducting
          ourselves like decent human beings
          again.

     The crowd is silent.

                    NICKY (CONT'D)
          And we get free pizza.

     The crowd roars.

     INT. ANNOUNCING BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

     Bill Walton's hair is now burnt looking.

                    BILL WALTON
          I think it's safe to say we're all
          rooting for this bizarre and hideous
          looking man.

     Bill Walton reaches over to an old lady sitting near him.  He
     takes off her wig, leaving behind her bald head, and puts her
     wig on his head in order to cover his burnt hair.

     The crowd starts YELLING.

                    CROWD
          Nicky!  Nicky!  Nicky!

     STANDS

     John and Peter are yelling the loudest.

     COURTSIDE

     The ref walks to half-court and hands Nicky the ball.

                    NICKY
          You know, Dad got very sick when you
          left.

                    REF
          I heard.  I'm glad he's dying.  It's my
          turn now.

     Nicky's eyes get red, he starts dribbling.

     INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

     Beefy is watching, transfixed.

                    BEEFY
          Take him to the hole, Nicky.
               (Todd stares)
          I mean, woof!  Woof!

     Todd looks at Beefy, terrified.

     INT. TUNNEL

     We see CORNROWS and some other Globetrotters are coming back
     from the locker room.  They stop to watch.

     INT. BASKETBALL COURT - MIDCOURT - CONTINUOUS

     Nicky pushes the ball up the court while the ref plays
     extremely tight defense.  Nicky fakes one way, then heads
     toward the basket.  The ref stays tight.  Nicky's eyes are
     redder than ever.  He fakes left, he fakes right.  He
     dribbles behind the back, dribbles between the legs, then
     takes his momentum up toward the basket.  He jumps from the
     foul line and flies through the air.  He emits a crazy, blood
     curdling, devil yell.

     CUT AWAY DURING DEVIL YELL TO:

     SHOT CLOCK

     It reads: 666.

     Popcorn and sodas EXPLODE.

     Cornrow's cornrows POP open into a GIANT AFRO.

     BACK ON NICKY

     Nicky's head starts turning and does a 360 (like the
     Exorcist).  He ends his flight by slamming down a thunderous
     dunk, cracking the backboard's glass into pieces.  He hits
     the ref on the way down.  The crowd CHEERS, finally happy
     again.

                    NICKY
          Never doubt my skills.

     INT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

                    CORNROWS
          Damn, I gotta learn how to do that.

     MID-COURT

     Nicky sees the ref is lying on the basketball arena floor,
     covered in glass.  He gets up slowly

                    REF
          That's nuts.  When'd you learn that
          shit?

                    NICKY
          Sorry, Cassius.  Maybe it was the super
          devil juice Dad gave me.  HE thought I
          might need it for just such an occasion.

                    REGIS
          Super devil juice?  Give it over.  Let's
          go best two out of three.

                    NICKY
               (pulls out the flask)
          No.  No way.  Dad said it was only for
          me.

     The ref rips the flask from Nicky and drinks.

     Cassius screams like bloody hell as he is sucked out of the
     ref's mouth and into the bottle.  WHOOSH!  The ref slumps to
     the floor.

     STANDS

     Still quiet until John and Peter rush to Nicky and bow.

     COURTSIDE

     Nicky peers into the flask.

                    CASSIUS (O.S.)
          Damn you, Nicky!  There ain't no super
          devil juice in here!

     Nicky caps the flask.  Nicky waves to the stunned, but
     appreciative crowd.

     INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     A homemade cake is laid out.  It reads: CONGRATULATIONS,
     NICKY.  JOHN, TODD, PETER AND BEEFY are there.

                    TODD
          So your father's the devil, you're a
          talking dog sent from Hell, and you guys
          are who?

                    PEEPER
          Just a couple of big fans of Nicky and
          the work his Dad does.

                    JOHN
          By the way, Nicky.  Check this out.

     He spins his Black Sabbath backwards.

                    JOHN (CONT'D)
          What's Ozzy trying to say there?

                    NICKY
          Absolutely nothing.  The Blizzard always
          came straight with his messages.  But
          wrap your minds around this one.

     Nicky gets up and we see his is sitting on a hibachi.  He pus
     on a James Taylor album and plays it backwards.

                    VOICE
          I command you in the name of the Lucifer
          to spread the blood of the innocent.

     John and Peter look at each other, shocked.

                    JOHN
          No wonder your uncle's so weird...

                    TODD
          I gotta say this cake tastes a little
          funny.

                    PETER
          Oh, I dumped a fat sack of reefer in the
          mix.  Tried to spice up the bash.

     Nicky takes a big bite of cake.

                    NICKY
          What's reefer?

                         DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. APARTMENT - LATER

     PAN UP from Popeye's laying everywhere.  Everyone's laughing
     hard.

                    JOHN
          Come on.  One more time.

                    NICKY
          Not again, fellas.  It kind of hurts.

                    PETER
          Please.  You got to.

                    NICKY
               (resigned)
          All right...

     Nicky loosens up his neck and makes his head go around 360
     degrees.  Everyone cracks up, high fives.  Even Todd LAUGHS.
     PAN OVER to Beefy, who has bloodshot eyes.

                    BEEFY
          I used to get baked like this with my
          first girlfriend, Heather.  We'd get so
          stoned she would forget I was a dog.

                    JOHN
          She was human?

                    BEEFY
          Actually, she was a sewer rat.  Man,
          that pissed my parents off.

                    JOHN
          I dated a Japanese girl once.  My
          parents disapproved.  Not cause she's
          Japanese, but cause she was only
          fifteen.

                    NICKY
          I'm only fifteen...thousand years old.

     Everyone cracks up.

                    TODD
          I was in love one time but she said I
          wasn't financially reliable enough.  And
          she needed that.

                    JOHN
          By she, do you mean he?

                    TODD
          No.

                    BEEFY
          Busted.
               (laughs)

                    PETER
          How you feelin' over there, Satan Abdul
          Jabar?

                    NICKY
          A little strange.  I can't stop thinking
          about this girl, Valerie.

                    TODD
          Why?  Did she hurt you?  Do you miss
          her?  Need a shoulder to cry on?

                    JOHN
          Easy, Liberace.

                    TODD
          Oh, would you grow up.

                    NICKY
          We had the greatest afternoon of my life
          until Adrian made me tell her she had a
          heart-shaped ass.

                    BEEFY
          Maybe you love her.  But what do I know?
          I'm baked out of my mind.

                    PETER
          Me, too.  We're gonna get going.

                    TODD
          You guys want to stay?  I have a futon
          in my bedroom.

                    JOHN
          That's a big pass, Elton John.

                    PETER
          We're going to see Ozzy play at the
          Meadowlands, right now.  Wanna come,
          Nicky?

                    NICKY
          No thanks.  I'm afraid I wouldn't be
          able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.

                    JOHN
          Whoa, that chick must be the real deal,
          then.  Later on.

                    NICKY
          See ya, fellas.

     They leave.

                    BEEFY (O.S.)
          You better snap out of it soon, kid.
          Cause we're going after Adrian tomorrow.
          Seven AM.  Nighty, night.

     He falls asleep and starts snoring.  We hear the SOUND of
     THREE LITTLE GIRLS singing "Ring Around The Rosie" as he
     exhales.

                    TODD
          That is the most frightening thing I
          have ever seen.

     Nicky stands and moves to the window.  He looks out longingly
     over the sleeping city... achingly.  RACK FOCUS behind him,
     we see Todd nodding encouragingly in the reflection.

                    NICKY
          Todd.  Which way to the Parson's School
          of Design?

     EXT. PARSON'S SCHOOL OF DESIGN - NIGHT

     Nicky walks around the corner.

     SIGN READS: "Parson's School -  Student Housing"

     Nicky is standing in front of the dorm rooms.  He looks up.
     Scanning the windows, he picks up a scent.

                    NICKY
               (he sniffs)
          Coconuts...

     Nicky goes to the fire escape and starts to climb.  His nose
     leads him.  He reaches the window, sniffing heavily.

     INT. DORM ROOM WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

     A STUDENT is standing in the window draped in silks, feeling
     his nipples with his legs crossed like the guy in "Silence of
     the Lambs."  The student is startled.

                    STUDENT
          Hello.

                    NICKY
          You smell like coconuts.

                    STUDENT
          It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific."  Makes me
          feel like a hula girl.  Which is kinda
          what I'm going for.  Wanna come in?

                    NICKY
          No thanks.  I'm looking for a girl named
          Valerie who also smells like coconuts.

                    STUDENT
          Valerie Doran?  Two floors up, one
          window over.

                    NICKY
          Thanks, much.  Good luck with the
          genital tucking.

                    STUDENT
          I don't need luck.  I'm good.

     Nicky floats away.  A few seconds later, he floats back,
     holding up the flask.

                    NICKY
          Adrian?

                    STUDENT
          Andrew.

     Nicky nods and floats off.

     EXT. VALERIE'S WINDOW - MOMENTS LATER

     Nicky crouches outside her window and peers in.

     INT. VALERIE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Cool music.  She is up late.  Working by candlelight on a
     fantastic design.  Something's not working.  She drapes a
     beautiful fabric over another.  She smiles at the
     combination.  She is happy being creative.  Nicky feels his
     heart swell as he watches her.

     ON NICKY

     He's so enraptured he leans forward trying to kiss her.  His
     head bumps the window.  She turns, startled.  She sees the
     beaming Nicky.

                    NICKY
          Hey.

                    VALERIE
          Nicky?  Oh my G-d.  Stay right there.

     Pause.  Valerie opens the window and sprays a can of mace
     right in Nicky's face.

                    NICKY
          Oh that stings!  My eyes are on fire!

     Nicky stands up and stumbles around.

                    VALERIE
          What were you thinking coming here?

                    NICKY
          I'm not sure, but it didn't involve
          getting blinded with poison.

     He bounces off the front rail, stumbles backward and goes
     flying over the back rail.

     EXT. VALERIE'S STREET - NIGHT

     We see Nicky hurtling toward the street.  Holding his eyes.

                    VALERIE
          Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry!

     Suddenly he stops.  Suspended above ground.  Valerie doesn't
     hear the expected thud.

                    VALERIE (CONT'D)
          Nicky?

     He floats up, but he can't see.

                    NICKY
          Valerie?

                    VALERIE
          Are you dead?

                    NICKY
          No.

                    VALERIE
          What are you doing?

                    NICKY
          I think I'm floating.

                    VALERIE
          Why would you be floating?

                    NICKY
          I don't know.  Maybe it's because of
          your sweet voice.

                    VALERIE
          Am I supposed to not be freaked out
          right now?  Because I am.

     He's floating up.  He slows down.

                    NICKY
          I can't see you but I can smell you.
          And you make me feel alive in a way I've
          never felt before.

     CUT TO REVEAL he's floating outside the student's window.
     The student's dripping candle wax on his belly.

                    STUDENT
          You got the wrong window again, man.

                    NICKY
          Oh.  Sorry, Andrew.  Valerie?

     Nicky resumes floating up.

                    VALERIE
          I'm over here, Nicky!  To the left.

     Nicky is parallel with her.  He hovers in front of her, eyes
     still watering.  She punches Nicky in the face, and he flies
     back ten feet.

                    VALERIE (CONT'D)
          Look, just because you're floating
          doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you
          giving me the finger.

                    NICKY
          That wasn't me.  I was being possessed
          by my brother, Adrian.  He's the one who
          call you a gross pig.

                    VALERIE
          What do you mean, "possessed?"

                    NICKY
          Remember when I told you my Dad was in
          Hell?

                    VALERIE
          Yes...

                    NICKY
          Well, that's because he's the Devil.
          And he wants to keep his throne for
          another ten-thousand years.  Which is
          fine with me, but not with my brothers,
          so they broke out of Hell, causing my
          dad...

                    VALERIE
          ... "The Devil?"...

                    NICKY
          ...to decompose.  And I love my  Dad
          very much.  So I came to Earth to save
          him but then crazy eyes stole my flask
          and I met you and...well, my dog tells
          me I just might be in love with you.

     His vision is clearing and he can start to see her.  She is
     totally in shock but still here.

                    VALERIE
          Okay, now I get that "deep south" joke.

     Nicky laughs.  Valerie joins in.

                    VALERIE (CONT'D)
          I don't know if I should believe you.

     Nicky starts to drop.

                    NICKY
          You gotta believe me.  You gotta believe
          in the butterflies.

                    VALERIE
          Okay, I do.  Get back up here.

     He floats up to her holding out his hand.  Nervously, she
     takes his hand and suddenly she is lifting off and they are
     flying.

     EXT. MANHATTAN - SKY - NIGHT

     They fly past the EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.

                    VALERIE
          This is amazing.

     They soar past some more buildings.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     The preacher sense something.  He looks to the sky, then
     holds the cross from around his neck as high as he can.

                    PREACHER
          The hellbeast is above us.  He's
          invading our skies!  We're all gonna
          die!  We're all gonna die!

     EXT. SKY - NIGHT

                    VALERIE
          He's kind of ruining the mood.

                    NICKY
          Let me take care of that.

     EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

     The preacher is still angrily shouting towards the sky.

                    PREACHER
          We're all gonna die!

     A fire hydrant cap turns and comes off.  A powerful blast of
     water shoots out and hits the preacher, KNOCKING him across
     the street into a plate glass window.

     EXT. NYC SKY - CONTINUOUS

                    VALERIE
          Can we go fly over Central Park?

                    NICKY
          Next time.  Tonight, I want to share the
          most beautiful thing I could possibly
          imagine.

     EXT. OVER THE HUDSON RIVER - NIGHT

     They fly over it, away from NYC.

                    VALERIE
          We're going to Jersey?

                    NICKY
          East Rutherford.

     EXT. MEADOWLANDS - NIGHT

     They float high above the Meadowlands.  There is an outdoor
     concert going on.  OZZFEST.
     We hear the Ozz on stage in his encore.  He is singing "Mr.
     Crowley."  Nicky turns to Valerie.

                    NICKY
          I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live
          until he was dead.
               (he looks at her)
          Please tell me you like metal.

                    VALERIE
               (sings along to song)
          "Mister Crowley, what's inside of your
          head..."

     Nicky's jaw drops as he stares at her.

                    NICKY
          My dog was right.  I'm in love with you.

     They slow dance tighter.  The music swells.  John and Peter
     look up from their seats far below.  Nicky sees them while
     he's holding her tight.  They give thumbs up.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. CITY STREET - MORNING

     Feeling great.  Spring in his step, we see Nicky walking down
     the street.

     He stops and smells some flowers at a Korean Tommet.  The
     KOREANS point and seem agitated by him.  Nicky gives them a
     friendly wave.

                    NICKY
               (in Korean)
          Moo ya san jie bay!

     The Koreans just glare.  Nicky's confused.

     MUSIC CUE:

     A dissonant, nervous score accompanies the rest of the
     sequence.

     EXT. STREET - DAY

     A NUT VENDOR leaves his cart and starts following.  Nicky
     looks back a little, unnerved.  A TAXI screeches in front of
     him.  The DRIVER gets out and goes after him.

     EXT. STREET - DAY

     A group of school girls in uniform break loose from their
     teacher and start chasing Nicky.

     EXT. BROWNSTONE STOOP - DAY

     A gigantically fat guy sees Nicky run by.  He thinks about
     going after him but decides not to and takes a big bite of a
     candy bar instead.

     EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY

     Ten guys playing wheelchair basketball see Nicky.  They point
     and start wheeling after him.

     EXT. HILLY STREET - DAY

     Nicky is putting some distance between him and the mob.

                    NICKY
          What's going on here?

     But when he heads downhill, the GUYS IN WHEELCHAIRS start to
     catch up.  They get closer and closer until... Nicky makes a
     last second right turn into an alley.  The wheelchairs can't
     slow down and crash into a double decker tourist BUS at the
     bottom of the street.  The TOURIST on the top level look over
     the edge to see the crash.

     EXT. ALLEY - DAY

     Nicky is panicking, out of breath.  A BUM (RADIOMAN) rises up
     out of his cardboard box.  The bum raises his bottle and
     thunks Nicky on the head.  It doesn't break.

                    NICKY
          Ow...what was that for?

                    BUM
          Fifty million dollars.

     The bum holds up a NEW YORK POST.  It reads "MONSTER WANTED!"
     And has a picture of Nicky.  Nicky is shocked.

     Nicky turns to run out of the alley, but the mob is there
     blocking the entrance.  He's trapped.  They start running
     right at him.  He closes his eyes.

                    NICKY
          Release the evil.

     Nicky's body splits into about five-hundred horrifying
     insects, all with a miniature NICKY HEAD.

     The Nickysects run right at the crowd, and the crows
     immediately starts running the other way, completely freaked
     out.

     INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Beefy and Todd are watching TV.  They look over to see the
     insects scurry under the front door and morph back into one
     exhausted Nicky.

                    NICKY
          I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.

                    BEEFY
          The shit has hit the fan, kid.  Take a
          look.

                    TODD
          Been breaking all morning.

     ON THE TV - DAY

     We see Dan Rather addressing the camera.

                    DAN RATHER
          At a news conference earlier today,
          Chief of Police Andy Shaifer gave this
          beleaguered city its latest dose of bad
          news.  He revealed that the man who
          caused a sensation at basketball arena
          last night is no hero... he is, in fact,
          a mass murderer.

     We see the chief of police behind a bunch of mics.  He's
     holding up a picture of Nicky taken at the Basketball arena.

     INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

     Nicky's outraged.

                    NICKY
          I didn't murder anybody

                    BEEFY
          Look.  You were really high.  Things
          happen.

                    NICKY
          I was with Valerie, I swear.  This is
          Adrian's work.  I've got to find him.

                    BEEFY
          I think you're looking at him.

     ON THE TV - DAY

     We reveal that the chief is standing on a grilled-cheese
     press to keep him warm.

                    CHIEF OF POLICE
               (on TV)
          This video shows what he did after he
          left the basketball arena yesterday...

     ON THE VIDEOTAPE - DAY

     Scarface shooting his AK-47.  Nicky's face has been crudely
     superimposed over his.

                    GUY
               (Adrian's voice)
          My name's Nicky, and I'm gonna kill all
          you suckers for no reason!

     CUT TO FOOTAGE on "SCARFACE"

     ON TV - DAY

     The Chief shakes his head.

                    CHIEF OF POLICE
          Difficult to watch, I know.  In response
          to this vicious crime, I am authorizing
          the largest reward in law enforcement
          history: fifty million dollars to the
          person or persons who bring this man to
          me.

     INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

     Nicky stands outraged.

                    NICKY
          This is baloney!

                    BEEFY
          He superimposed your head onto
          "Scarface."

                    TODD
          ...which is by far DePalma's best
          work...

     A LOUD KNOCKING AT THE DOOR

     The pounding increases.

                    NICKY
          I'm not Nicky.  I'm not home!  I don't
          live here!

                    PETER
          Dude, it's us.  Let us in.

     Nicky opens the door.  Peter and John stumble in.

                    JOHN
          There's like a total mob scene coming
          this way.

     We hear VOICES of an approaching crowd coming outside.

                    NICKY
          I thought for sure I gave 'em the slip.

     Todd i s looking out the window.

                    TODD
          Looks like they're following a giant
          trail of bug shit.

                    PETER
          What'll we do now, Beefy?

                    BEEFY
          I don't know, this is a little out of my
          league.

     VOICES GROW LOUDER.

                    VOICES (O.S.)
          Come on.  Let's get 'em.

                    JOHN
          What would your dad do, Nicky?

                    NICKY
          Good idea...kill me.

                    PETER
          Dude.  Seriously?

                    NICKY
          Yes.  I'll meet you at Grand Central at
          noon.  Okay.  Do me.  I command you.

                    JOHN AND PETER
               (psyched)
          Alright!

     John takes Nicky's head and slams it hard into the kitchen
     counter.  Nicky is dazed.

                    NICKY
          That just hurt a lot.

                    TODD
          I've always wanted to kill someone.  Can
          I do it?

                    JOHN
          Look at Queen Latifah steppin' up.

     INT. BATHROOM - DAY

     Nicky is in the bathtub being angrily drowned by Todd.  John
     and Peter watch happily.

                    TODD
          Die, Grandma, die!

     Nicky's arm comes out with a thumbs up.  Pause.  The hand
     drops back in.  He's dead.

     INT. THRONE ROOM - LATER

     Start on a CLOSE UP of Lucifer.  He's holding cards, looking
     at his hand.

                    LUCIFER
          Royal flush, you lose.  Off with the
          bra.

     The Demons and Gatekeeper are sitting around playing strip
     poker.  The Gatekeeper takes off his bra.  From behind, we
     see his breasts flop out.

                    LUCIFER (CONT'D)
          Last time I saw a pair of jugs that big,
          two hillbillies were blowing on them.

     The Gatekeeper throws his hand down and storms out.  The
     Monster laughs uproariously.  Nicky enters and moves to
     what's left of his dad.  Arms, torso, and a head (with one
     ear).

                    NICKY
          Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after
          me.  He's always a step ahead.  What am
          I gonna do?

                    DAD
          What are you gonna do?  Look at me,
          Nicky!  I got no legs, I got no hips, I
          got one ear...

     Dad's remaining ear falls out.

                    DAD (CONT'D)
          I got no ears!  I can't hear!

                    JIMMY THE DEMON
          Now he's got no ears!  You happy, Nicky?
          Your father's got no ears!

                    NICKY
          Uh, I'll do my best, Dad.  Do you have
          any advice at all for me?

                    DAD
          I can't hear you, Nicky.  I can't hear
          anything!

     Jimmy picks up the ear.  Jimmy speaks into it.

                    JIMMY THE DEMON
          Check one-two.  Check one-two.

                    DAD
          Put it back on my head.  I'm falling
          apart here.

                    JIMMY THE DEMON
          He's got 'til midnight tonight, Nicky.
               (putting ear back on Dad)
          You get your ass back up there.  You
          save your father!

     Nicky looks very upset.

     EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

     We see John and Peter enter frame.  Looking very nervous.

                    PETER
          You sure you're down with this?

                    JOHN
          Little nervous.  Wanna puke.

     They approach the cops guarding the door.

                    JOHN (CONT'D)
          Looking for the chief.

                    PETER
          We know where to find Nicky.

     COPS grab John & Peter and drag them inside.

     INT. CHIEF'S OFFICE - DAY

     Surrounded by prostitutes and criminals in a very hot room,
     the chief of police puts down his bottle of PEPPERMINT
     SCHNAPPS, stands up and looks at the two idiots.

                    CHIEF OF POLICE
          You have what I want?

                    JOHN
          Sure do.  You got what we want?

                    PETER
          Fifty million bones, bro.

     He nods to a DEPUTY who gives them a briefcase of money.

                    CHIEF OF POLICE
          That's half of it.  You get the rest
          when I get Nicky.

                    PETER
          Excellent.  But I gotta warn you, man.
          He's not human.

                    CHIEF OF POLICE
          Really?

                    JOHN
          We think he's the son of Satan.

     PAUSE.  The chief LAUGHS, then everyone else does.  He walks
     over and picks them up by their throats.

                    CHIEF OF POLICE
          Well, then I guess I'll have to be extra
          careful.  Now where is he?

     INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY

     We see the BIG CLOCK on the wall.  FIVE minutes til NOON.  We
     see JOHN and PETER (with the briefcase) walking into GRAND
     CENTRAL with the chief and twenty-five NYC cops.  The chief
     bumps into a filthy bag lady drinking out of paper sack.

                    BAG LADY
          Hey, watch it!  Who do you think you
          are?

                    CHIEF OF POLICE
               (never stopping)
          Emperor of the New Hell.

     They march through onto the platform for Track 33.

     INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAY

     We see Beefy and Todd waiting by the place where Nicky
     usually comes up.  It is hot down there.  Steam and smoke
     comes out of the tunnels.  Todd is nervous.

                    TODD
          Where is he?  He's late.

                    BEEFY
          He'll be here.  Just keep your cool,
          kid.

     They hear FOOTSTEPS.  They turn and see the chief of police
     backed up by the huge police force.

                    BEEFY (CONT'D)
          We've been ratted out.

     Beefy and Todd turn to see John and Peter looking sheepish.

                    TODD
          You guys.  That was so uncool.

                    PETER
          We thought the son of Satan would
          understand a move like this.

     Peter and John high-five.

                    CHIEF OF POLICE
          Okay, take these two outside.  I can
          handle this.

     The police grab Todd and put a leash on Beefy.  The cops lead
     their prisoners away down the tunnel, leaving John and Peter
     alone with the chief.

                    CHIEF OF POLICE (CONT'D)
          Wanna see something cool?

     The chief inserts a finger into his nostril.  Then he fits
     his hand up there.  Soon his whole arm is up his nostril as
     he searches for something.  John and Peter are impressed.
     The chief grabs something and starts to pull.  Then out of
     his nose comes Adrian, who fully forms as the shell of the
     chief's body slumps to the ground.

                    ADRIAN
          Ta-da.  So what time is my brother
          expected back?

                    JOHN
          Noon...

     They look at the clock.  It's noon.

                    JOHN (CONT'D)
          ...ish.

     Peter is sweating, kinda nervous.

                    PETER
          So even though you're not really the
          chief, we still get the rest of the
          cash, right bro?

                    ADRIAN
          You know what you'll get?  An
          indescribably horrific torture
          administered by demons for the rest of
          eternity.

                    JOHN
          But what about the cash?  Can we keep it
          or what?

                    ADRIAN
          Sure, why not?

     They high five.  Adrian smiles and waits.  It is real hot
     down there.  We hear a train coming in the distance.  A fan
     circles slowly.  They all wait for him.

                    LADY
               (mumbling to herself)
          Food stamps?
          They should call 'em "dude stamps."
          Cause ever time I get one, some dude
          takes it away...

     We see the HOMELESS LADY down the platform stumbling her way
     towards them, drunk.  Adrian scowls at her.

                    LADY (CONT'D)
          Hey, studs.  I'll let you make out with
          me for a dollar!

                    JOHN
          No thanks...but we'll take that bottle
          of booze.
               (grabs the bottle, laughs)

                    LADY
          Hey...that's mine.

     Peter pushes her away.

                    PETER
          Beat it, ya freak.

     John and Peter high five and John swigs from the bag.

                    JOHN
          Schnapps...

                    PETER
               (takes the bag, swigs)
          Peppermint...alright.

     Adrian raises his eyebrows.  We see that the homeless lady is
     actually VALERIE in disguise.  She looks back, tense.  John
     offers Adrian the flask.

                    JOHN
          Wanna hit?

     Hands it to him.  He takes it.

                    PETER
          Drink up.  Here's to fifty million
          clams.

                    ADRIAN
          To the defilement of Earth and the
          corruption of its people.

                    PETER
          Whatever.  Knock it back, grab Nicky and
          let's get outta this hell-hole.

     Adrian smiles at John, then raises the bag.  He stops just
     before it hits his lips.  He looks at John curiously.

                    ADRIAN
          It is awfully hot down here.  How do you
          manage to stay so cool?

                    JOHN
          Weed lowers the body temperature.
               (stuttering)
          I read that...in, uh...er, science
          magazine.

     Adrian stares at John.  He raises the bag again.

                    ADRIAN
          This liquid will probably quench my
          thirst.  Cool me off.

                    PETER
          Definitely.

                    JOHN
          And give you a good buzz.

                    ADRIAN
          Or maybe it will trap me inside for all
          eternity.

                    JOHN
          Uh.  No it won't?

     John starts to tremble a bit.

                    ADRIAN
          Oh, Nicky, I've missed you.  Come on out
          and say hello...

                    JOHN
          Urr...uggg...errr...

                    ADRIAN
               (eyes getting red)
          I'm calling you out, brother...

     Adrian is mentally pulling Nicky out of John.  Nicky/John
     wages an epic battle with himself as Adrian smiles.

                    JOHN/NICKY
          Urrr...uggh...
               (as Nicky)
          Oww.  Adrian, this is very painful.

     Nicky comes flying out.  John's body slumps to the floor next
     to the chief's.  Adrian looks in the "Schnapps bottle" to see
     the flask wrapped in paper.  He peeks inside.

                    ADRIAN
          Hello, Cassius.

                    CASSIUS (O.S.)
          All right.  Let me out.

                    ADRIAN
          You know, New Hell really only needs one
          new Satan.

                    CASSIUS (O.S.)
          You mother...

     Adrian hands Nicky the flask.

                    ADRIAN
          But Cassius could use some company for
          the rest of eternity.  So get in the
          flask.

     He puts the Flask in Nicky's hands.

     INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - PAVILLION - MOMENTS LATER

     The police are escorting Beefy and Todd through the terminal.
     Beefy starts whining and stops.  The cops look down.  Beefy
     raises his leg.

                    COP
          Oh, he's gotta pee.

     A thick, yellow smoke shoots out of Beefy, enveloping the
     group.  Beefy escapes and bolts back down stairs.

                    TODD
          Run, Beefy!  Run!

     INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS

     Adrian stares down Nicky.

                    NICKY
          I won't drink.  You can't make me.

     Adrian looks over at Valerie.  Suddenly she comes flying over
     to him.  He grabs her by the throat.

     We hear a train coming in the distance.

                    ADRIAN
          Of course I can.  Drink or she dies.
               (Nicky is scared)
          Unlike you, she won't come back from
          where she's going.

                    NICKY
          Let her go.

                    ADRIAN
          I hear a train coming.  Drink.

     The train sound is coming CLOSER.  Valerie looks at Nicky.
     Nicky raises the flash to drink.

                    VALERIE
          Don't do it.

                    NICKY
          I have to, Valerie.

     We see Beefy skid to a stop, raise his leg and a full size
     archery arrow shoots out of his penis and tracks right into
     ADRIAN'S LEG.

                    ADRIAN
          Ahhh!

                    BEEFY
          Now that hurt the both of us.

     Valerie is able to escape momentarily.  Adrian reaches for
     her, grabbing her.  They both spin and fall down onto the
     tracks.  Right into the oncoming train.

                    NICKY
          Valerie!!!

     Nicky leaps down onto the tracks, wrestles Valerie away from
     Adrian and tosses her off the tracks.  Adrian looks at Nicky.

                    ADRIAN
          See you in Hell!

     WHAMM!  The train comes by, hitting both Adrian and Nicky.

     INT. HELL GATES - CONTINUOUS

     Adrian comes flying through the solid firefall into Hell.  He
     looks around.  Confused, there's no Nicky.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. BEAUTIFUL FIELD - DAY

     Nicky is lying in a huge field of tall, very green grass.  He
     sits up, and feels his face to make sure it's all there.

     Nicky looks around, alarmed.  He seems to be in a mountain
     vale, maybe in the foothills of the Alps.  It's gorgeous.

     Off in the distance, floating in the air, is a giant birthday
     cake.  Nicky stands up and the cottage seems to be floating
     down to him.

     EXT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - DAY

     The cake lands softly in front of him, the door ajar.  After
     a moment's hesitation, Nicky goes in.

     INT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - CONTINUOUS

     Nicky enters the cake to find ANGEL and two friends: JENNA
     and CHRISTA.  They are doing arts and crafts sort of things
     on a glass table in front of them.  They stare at him.  Angel
     rises.

                    ANGEL
          Oh. My. G-d.  I can't believe you're
          here.  Welcome.  Can I just tell you, I
          am so excited right now.

                    CHRISTA
          So excited.

                    JENNA
          She really is.

                    NICKY
          That's terrific.  Now could you ladies
          point me to the Black Palace?  I should
          check in with my dad...

     Nicky trails off as he sees the Angels laughing at him.

                    ANGEL
          I'm sorry, you're just so cute.

                    JENNA
          Do you have any idea where you are right
          now?

                    NICKY
          The home of eternal damnation, house of
          Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...

                    ANGEL
          Maybe try the opposite of that.

     The Angel and two friends laugh and high-five.  Nicky's
     confused.

                    ANGEL (CONT'D)
          Okay, can I just ask you something?
          What do you know about your mom?

                    NICKY
          My brothers told me my mother was a
          mountain goat.  Which would explain my
          chronic halitosis.

                    ANGEL
               (annoyed)
          A mountain goat?  That's really sweet.

                    NICKY
          My mom wasn't a goat?

                    ANGEL
          Try an angel.

                    NICKY
          An angel?

                    ANGEL
          Unh-huh.  Which would make you half
          angel.

     Nicky is floored.

                    NICKY
          Wow.  What...what did she look like?

                    ANGEL
          Well, she was about six-three, only
          spoke Portuguese and had really long
          grey hair.

     The GIRLS start laughing.

                    ANGEL (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry, I'm totally busting on you.
          I'm your mom.

     Nicky is even more floored.  FLASH.  Jenna has taken a
     picture of Nicky.

                    JENNA
          I'm sorry, but you just had the sweetest
          look on your face.

                    CHRISTA
          You're gonna be so happy she did that.

                    NICKY
               (stunned)
          How come you're not older?

                    ANGEL
          Angels don't get any older, son.

                    JENNA
          I can't believe you just called him
          "son."

                    ANGEL
          Oh my G-d.  This is so wild.

     They laugh.  Nicky is quite baffled.

     INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY

     Dad is just a pair of lips, with ears on either side held up
     by two forearms with hands attached, lying on the throne.
     Gatekeeper, Lucifer, Jimmy and a few other demons stand
     around.

                    DAD
          I can't see shit.  You're all still
          here, right?

     Adrian enters.  They all cheer.

                    JIMMY THE DEMON
          Adrian's here.  You'll be back to normal
          in a jiffy, sir.

                    DAD LIPS
          Yea!  I can't believe little Nicky came
          through.

                    ADRIAN
          Where's Nicky?

                    JIMMY THE DEMON
          He came with you and Cassius, right?

                    ADRIAN
          I came through that gate alone.

                    JIMMY THE DEMON
          Sorry, sir, false alarm.

                    DAD
          Boooo.

                    ADRIAN
          Somebody explain what's going on.

     Puts the Gatekeeper in a headlock.

                    GATEKEEPER
          You'll get nothing out of me.

                    ADRIAN
          Perhaps a titty twister will loosen your
          lips.

     He twists a breast.  The Gatekeeper babbles out the
     information immediately.

                    GATEKEEPER
          The only way to save your dad is for you
          and your brothers to pass through the
          gates at the same time before he
          deteriorates completely.

                    ADRIAN
          How much time does Dad have before that
          happens?

     Adrian twists hard.

                    GATEKEEPER
          Thirty minutes.  And then whoever claims
          his throne will have unimaginable power.

     Adrian throws him down.

                    LUCIFER
          All boobs and no balls.

                    ADRIAN
          Thirty minutes.  Hmmm.  I hope you don't
          mind if I take a seat while I wait for
          you.

     He moves to the throne and throws the lips off.

                    DAD LIPS
          Ahhh!

     He pushes Lucifer out of the way.

                    LUCIFER
          I don't get no respect.

                    ADRIAN
          Ten thousand years.  And I never once
          got to sit here.

     He sits on the throne and it starts to shake a little.  He
     grins as two horns grow out of his forehead.

                    ADRIAN (CONT'D)
          Wow.  And this is just a little taste of
          my power.

                    DAD
          Hell's gonna bust wide open.  Demons,
          get him out of the chair!

     The demons approach.

                    ADRIAN
          Ah-ah.  Not so fast, demons.  There are
          a couple of million evil souls on Earth
          ready to be harvested.  Anyone
          interested?

     The demons stop.  Now loyal to Adrian.  All except Jimmy.

     INT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - DAY

     Everyone is sitting around drinking Diet Cokes.

                    NICKY
          Are you Adrian and Cassius' mom, too?

                    CHRISTA
          No, their mother's weren't angels.

                    ANGEL
          I think they were hookers or strippers
          or something really porno like...

     There's a knock on the door. It opens and in comes Carl
     Weathers dressed as Chubbs from Happy Gilmore.

                    CHUBBS
          Holly, Jenna, Christa. Time for your
          Mambo lesson.

                    ANGEL
          Oh, Chubbs.  I totally spaced.  I'm so
          sorry.  I have company.  It's my son,
          Nicky.  My son.  Can you believe it?

                    CHUBBS
          Wow, that's terrific.

                    ANGEL
          Nicky, this is Chubbs.  He used to be a
          golf pro, but up here he's the dopest
          dance instructor.

                    CHUBBS
          You mambo?

                    NICKY
          I don't think so.

                    CHUBBS
          Remember, it's all in the hips.  It's
          all in the hips.

     Chubbs dances as he leaves.

                    NICKY
          Where did you meet my father?

                    ANGEL
          It was a long time ago, at some Heaven
          and Hell mixer.

                    CHRISTA
          I remember that night, you had like four
          daiquiris.

                    ANGEL
          Try four and a half.  At first I totally
          didn't like him.

                    JENNA
          He was really conceited.

                    ANGEL
          But I don't know, he was funny, he made
          me laugh, and I hate to say it but he
          had a really nice body.

                    NICKY
          And that made you want to make a baby
          with him?

     The Angels laugh.

                    ANGEL
          Well, I really wasn't thinking about
          making a baby at the time!

     Her cell-phone rings.  She answers it.

                    ANGEL (CONT'D)
          Hello....yes, he's here with me now... I
          don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you
          perv!  I'll call you back...
               (laughs)
          Oh my G-d, I will call you back,
          goodbye.
               (hangs up)
          That was my friend, Michelle, she says
          "hi."

                    NICKY
          Well tell her I said "hi" back.

     Angel makes a motion towards the phone, then stops.

                    ANGEL
          I'll call her later.

                    CHRISTA
          You know, we saw you save your
          girlfriend's life.

                    JENNA
          That was so cool.

                    ANGEL
          That's why you came up to Heaven instead
          of Hell.  Self-sacrifice automatically
          gets you here.

                    NICKY
          How did you see me?

                    ANGEL
          We can see what's going on anywhere on
          Earth.  Look.

     Angel and the girls clear the junk from the glass table in
     front of them.  Angel touches the glass and it turns into a
     reflection of Earth below.

     EXT. TIME'S SQUARE - NIGHT

     People are rioting in the streets.  Looting appliance
     stores...

                    ANGEL (O.S.)
          All these good people have totally been
          led astray.

                    CHRISTA (O.S.)
          Show him Central Park.

     EXT. CENTRAL PARK LAWN - NIGHT

     People are drinking and smoking and burning things.  A large
     circle has formed around two old ladies who are fist
     fighting.  One old lady knocks the other to the ground, then
     jumps on her and starts wailing away.  The spectators
     exchange money.

                    ANGEL (O.S.)
          There's like a three day rave goin' on
          down there.  No on is going to work
          anymore.

     Then suddenly we see the ground start to break up and Adrian
     on his throne start to be thrust upwards.  Demons swarm
     around him.

                    ADRIAN
          Welcome to the party.  It's so nice to
          see all of you here.

                    NICKY (O.S.)
          Hey, that's Dad's throne!  How did
          Adrian get that?  Is Dad okay?

                    ANGEL (O.S.)
          Let's see...

                         RIPPLE DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     DAD LIPS are morosely talking to the Gatekeeper and Jimmy.

                    DAD LIPS
          I was a good Devil, wasn't I?

                    JIMMY THE DEMON
          You were the best Devil, boss, the best
          Devil!

                    GATEKEEPER
          Absolutely.

                    DAD LIPS
          I tried to do some interesting stuff...

                    JIMMY THE DEMON
          You did amazing stuff!

                    GATEKEEPER
          I don't know how you came up with some
          of it.

                    DAD LIPS
          Really?  That means a lot to me.

                    JENNA (O.S.)
          Oh my G-d.  He looks gross.

                    ANGEL (O.S.)
          I can't believe I did it with him.

     She touches the pool again and the reflection changes to:

     EXT. NEW HELL THRONE - NIGHT

     Adrian steps off his throne onto a small stage flanked by SIX
     HERO DEMONS.  He begins addressing the crowd.

                    ADRIAN
          I'm very proud of you.  You've taken to
          sin with minimal prompting.

     The crowd cheers.

                    ADRIAN (CONT'D)
          You're acting as if there is no Heaven
          or Hell.

     The crowd cheers.

     EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - NIGHT

     We see John, Peter, Beefy, Valerie and Todd hanging on
     flagpoles by their underwear.  Beefy is in a special fitted
     harness that looks like underwear.

                    ADRIAN
          Well, I have some news.

     Adrian morphs into the Cardinal from earlier.

                    CARDINAL
          There is most definitely a Hell!  And
          you're all going there when you die!
          Which will happen in about fifteen
          minutes.

     EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT

     The BAD PEOPLE realize they've been tricked into being bad
     and they get scared.
     The Preacher, who is now more battered from his fall through
     the plate glass window (ask Steve), yells out.

                    PREACHER
          We really are gonna die!

     This kicks off a frenzy of the Scared Bad People trying to
     run away.  But they are stopped and herded back by DEMONS.

     EXT. FLAGPOLES - CONTINUOUS

                    PETER
          This don't look good.

                    JOHN
          Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get
          us out of this?

                    TODD
          They castrated him.  He can't shoot
          arrows, he can't piss smoke.

                    BEEFY
          I can't screw.
               (whimpers)
          I can't screw.

     Valerie's crying.

     INT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS

     Nicky is shocked.

                    NICKY
          Valerie's crying!

                    ANGEL
          She's so nice.

                    CHRISTA
          She goes to Parson's, right?

                    ANGEL
          I would totally love to go there.  But I
          hear it's really hard to get in.

                    NICKY
          I gotta help her.  I gotta help Dad.  I
          gotta help everybody.

                    ANGEL
          Yeah, you do...

     INT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS

     Adrian is looking at a clock tower that reads 11:45.

                    ADRIAN (V.O.)
          At the stroke of midnight, my father
          will be completely deteriorated.  And
          all of your souls will be mine.

     EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - CONTINUOUS

                    ADRIAN
          Soon you will see things more horrible
          than you can even imagine.

     Adrian scans the crowd.  He sees...

     EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - CONTINUOUS

     The Parsons STUDENT in the kimono dancing sexily.  Adrian is
     thrown.

     EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - CONTINUOUS

                    ADRIAN
          Not that horrible, but still pretty bad.

     Adrian motions to some of his guards.  They nod.

                    ADRIAN (CONT'D)
          So while we wait, for your enjoyment, I
          bring you a dear sweet man and an
          international icon...Henry Winkler!

     A frightened HENRY WINKLER is lead onto the stage prodded by
     two DEMONS.

     EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - CONTINUOUS

     The scared bad people finally smile.

     EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - CONTINUOUS

                    ADRIAN
          Covered in bees!

     We see Henry Winkler is suddenly covered head to in a swarm
     of bees.

     EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - CONTINUOUS

     The crowd gasps.

     INT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS

     Nicky is starting to panic.

                    NICKY
          But how can I win?  Adrian is stronger
          and smarter than me.

                    ANGEL
          Stronger, yes.  Smarter, definitely.
          But you have something he doesn't have.

                    NICKY
          A speech impediment?

     The girls laugh.

                    ANGEL
          No, you have the inner light.  You can
          totally use it.  It's the best power of
          all.
               (he smiles)
          And in case you get in real bad trouble,
          G-d told me to give you this.

     She gives him an ornate, jewelled ball.

                    NICKY
          What is it?

                    ANGEL
          I'm not a hundred percent on that.  G-d
          said when the time comes, you'll know
          what to do.

                    CHRISTA
          G-d's so smart.

                    JENNA
          The smartest.

                    ANGEL
          Well, goodbye...for now.
               (looks at his face)
          Can I just do this?

     She licks her finger and wipes some dirt off his forehead.

                    ANGEL (CONT'D)
          That was such a Mom thing, wasn't it?

                    FRIEND
          Totally.

                    NICKY
          Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.
               (to Angel)
          Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?

                    ANGEL
          It would be so okay.

     Nicky hugs his Mom.

                    NICKY
          Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple
          cause I'm gonna rock that town like a
          hurricane.

                    ANGEL (O.S.)
          You're already there...

     EXT. CENTRAL PARK POND SHORE - NIGHT

     Nicky dissolves into walking.  He checks his pocket to see
     the ball.  He looks up to see fifteen Demons marching towards
     him, ready to attack.  Nicky closes his eyes and
     concentrates.

                    NICKY
          Release...the good.

     When he opens them, BEAUTIFUL BUTTERFLIES are floating around
     the head of five of the DEMONS.  They stop approaching.
     THEIR EYES TURN FROM WHITE BACK TO NORMAL.  And their facial
     expression changes to happiness.  They wave at the
     butterflies.

     ANGLE ON

     MORE DEMONS keep closing.

                    NICKY (CONT'D)
          Release the good...

     Five more are stopped by something.  They look down and see
     fluffy white BUNNY RABBITS at their feet.  They start petting
     them.

     The REMAINING DEMONS advance on Nicky.

                    NICKY (CONT'D)
          Release the awesome.

     ...then stop, their path blocked by a very large bucket of
     POPEYE'S FRIED CHICKEN.  The Demons consider the bucket of
     chicken.  One Demon takes out a piece.

                    NICKY (CONT'D)
          Put it in your mouth and let it slide
          down your throat-hole.

     The Demon bites into it.  He can't help but grin a little.

                    DEMON
          Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!

     The OTHER SOULS dig into the bucket.

     EXT. CLOCK TOWER - CONTINUOUS

     Only ten minutes left.

     EXT. FLAGPOLES - CONTINUOUS

     The dudes on the flagpoles are chatting nervously.

                    TODD
          One thing I really regret is never
          having experimented sexually.

                    PETER
          You mean, like, experiment with a Bunsen
          Burner?  What are you talking about?

                    JOHN
          He means getting it on with someone like
          that freak.

     ANGLE ON:

     The student dancing for a mesmerized Demon.

     BACK ON PETER, TODD and JOHN

                    TODD
          His name is Andrew.  I know that guy.

                    JOHN
          Of course you do, Tommy Tune.

     EXT. CENTRAL PARK PATH - NIGHT

     Nicky leads his small army of reformed Demons (followed by
     butterflies & bunnies and carrying the chicken bucket) down
     the path toward the rally.  We see they have a golden
     light/haze of good around them.

     EXT. FLAGPOLES - CONTINUOUS

     Adrian is underneath Valerie.

                    ADRIAN
          You know, from this angle, you're kind
          of cute.

                    VALERIE
          You think so?  Why don't you come a
          little closer and I'll show you a better
          angle.

     He moves a little closer, and she spits on him.  He smiles.
     Opens his mouth and catches her spit.  He swallows.

                    ADRIAN
          Yummy.

     Everyone is grossed out.

                    TODD
          Oh my G-d, he just opened his mouth and
          swallowed that spit.

                    BEEFY
          That turn you on there, RuPaul?

                    ADRIAN
          Keep it up and I just might make you my
          Queen for a night or two.

                    JOHN
          You want a queen?  Got one right here.

     John points at Todd.  They laugh.  Adrian gets closer to
     Valerie.  Just then a big butterfly appears on his shoulder.
     He looks down to see:

     Nicky standing there with his army.

                    ADRIAN (O.S.)
          Little Nicky.

                    NICKY
          Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the
          name of all that is good: release my
          friends and get in the flask.

                    ADRIAN
          Is this a joke?

                    NICKY
          No.  It's the inner light.  And with it
          we can defeat anything you've got.

                    REFORMED DEMON
               (eating Popeye's chicken)
          It's true!

     Adrian glares down at the REFORMED DEMON.  His eyes shoot out
     an evil ray.

     The Reformed Demon explodes into a million pieces.  His
     golden insides splatter on the crowd.

     The Army of Good is shaken.  Another Demon lowers his
     chicken.

                    ANOTHER REFORMED DEMON
          It's not true?

     The BUCKET OF CHICKEN sprouts legs and runs away.  Nicky
     steps forward bravely.

                    NICKY
          Okay, Adrian, you've left me with no
          choice.

     Nicky leaves frame and he flies up towards Adrian.

      EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - CONTINUOUS

     Nicky lands on both feet standing before Adrian.

                    NICKY
          Love lifts me up where I belong.

     ANGLE ON

     Crowd reacts.

     ON HELL STAGE

     Demons are ready to attack.  Adrian waves them off.

                    ADRIAN
          Not bad, little brother.  Let's see what
          you've got.

     Nicky thinks, holds out his hands.  A rainbow shoots out onto
     the stage between them.  PAUSE.  We see that a cute little
     chipmunk is standing on it's hindlegs eating a nut.

     ON CROWD

     The army of good and scared bad people applaud as they see
     this.

     BACK ON HELL STAGE

     Adrian nods, holds out his arms and a red stream shoots out.
     He has made a terrible PYTHON that comes over and eats the
     baffled chipmunk in one bite.

     Nicky raises his hand and: turns the snake into a row of
     flowers.

     Adrian raises his hand and a crazed MEXICAN GARDNER with a
     lawn mower comes by and mows them down.

     Nicky turns the Gardner and his lawn mower into a MOTHER
     pushing a NEW BORN BABY in a carriage.

     Adrian turns the baby in the carriage into an EVIL DWARF who
     leaps out and starts beating up on the mother.

     Nicky turns the Mother into a HOT GIRL DWARF.  The evil Dwarf
     stops beating her up and holds her hand.

                    ADRIAN (CONT'D)
          Enough.  I'm going to kill you with my
          bare hands.

     Adrian punches Nicky hard in the jaw.  He goes flying off the
     platform.

     Nicky's body falls towards the ground.  It's about to hit,
     when a soft bed of posts and fluffy pillows break his fall.

     INT. HEAVEN - CONTINUOUS

     We now see Angel, Jenna, Christa and SEVEN OTHER GIRLS
     watching the action on the table.

                    ANGEL
          I totally had to do that.

                    ALL THE GIRLS
          Yah you did.

     CHUBBS is there, too.

     EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT

     Nicky looks up to see Adrian flying down towards him.  Nicky
     rolls away at the last second.  Adrian hits the bed hard and
     bounces up.  Nicky grabs him mid-bounce and slams him back
     down into the golden/brass headboard of the bed.  Nicky holds
     out the flask.

                    NICKY
          Now I'm asking you nicely, get in the
          flas...

     Adrian grabs a pillow and hits Nicky hard in the face,
     sending him flying off the bed.

                    NICKY (CONT'D)
          Oh, you wanna a pillow fight, do you?!

     Nicky is an expert pillow fighter.  He lands a series of
     awesome, almost Matrix-like pillow moves.  Adrian is dazed.

     Nicky finishes him off by tossing the pillow high in the air
     to him.  Adrian looks up to catch it and just before it
     lands, Nicky steps up and pops him in the face.  Adrian goes
     down hard.  Nicky towers over him.

                    NICKY (CONT'D)
          Now will you get in the flask?

                    ADRIAN
          Absolutely not.

     Adrian turns to his demons.

                    ADRIAN (CONT'D)
          A little help over here.

     A bunch of Demons advance.

     ON FLAGPOLE

     We see Henry Winkler, swollen with bee stings, valiantly run
     over and lowers the five from the flagpoles.

     ON ADRIAN

     He looks up and glares at Henry.

                    ADRIAN (CONT'D)
          Henry!

     ON FLAGPOLE

     Henry's eyes widen.

                    HENRY WINKLER
          Oh no.

     He is covered in bees again.

     BACK ON ADRIAN

     He turns his attention back to Nicky who is grabbed by
     demons.  Adrian brings the flask to his lips, but he won't
     open his mouth.

     Adrian pinches Nicky's nose closed so he has to open his
     mouth.

                    ADRIAN
          Goodbye, Nicky.

     We hear CASSIUS banging against the walls.

                    CASSIUS (O.S.)
          Come on in, bro.

     Nicky can't hold his breath and opens his mouth.  Adrian jams
     the flask in his mouth and Nicky starts to get sucked in.
     Adrian smiles.  But just before Nicky is gone, he manages to
     grab Adrian's coat tail and yank him into the flask with him.

     As the flask hits the ground, we HEAR:

                    CASSIUS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Thank you, Nicky.  Cause now I'm gonna
          bust Adrian's head wide open.

                    ADRIAN (O.S.)
          I was going to let you out, eventually,
          Cassius.  I swear.

                    NICKY (O.S.)
          Sole ruler of Hell and Earth is what I
          heard him keep saying.

     We HEAR the sounds of a struggle.

     All the Demons and all the people of NEW YORK form a large
     circle around the flask.  Valerie and the gang make it down
     off the stage.

     We HEAR crazy sounds as the FLASK starts to jump.  The crowd
     REACTS.  A big dent pops out from the inside, followed by a
     horrible thud.

                    VALERIE
          Nicky!

                    NICKY (O.S.)
          That was Cassius!

     The FLASK starts rolling over and over on the road.  People
     get out of the way as if it were real people fighting in the
     street.  They root for their side.

                    DEMON
          Kill him, Adrian.

     John and Peter start beating up the Demon.

     INT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS

     The Angel and the Friend are praying.

     EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - CONTINUOUS

     We HEAR banging and beating and yelling from inside and then
     the flask stops bouncing.  SILENCE.  Everybody outside holds
     their breath.  Slowly out of the spout crawls NICKY.

     HOORAY.  Valerie, John, Todd and Beefy and all the living
     people CHEER.  The student, very happy, opens his kimono.
     The people and demons near him are grossed out.

     Valerie goes tot he very beaten up Nicky and hugs him.

                    VALERIE
          Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to
          fight like that?

                    NICKY
          From my dad's side of the family.

     She laughs and kisses him on the mouth.  The crowd CHEERS.
     But Nicky won't stop kissing her.  She starts to struggle for
     air.  Nicky presses harder and starts to laugh.

     The crowd stops CHEERING.  Valerie is waving her arms for
     help.  Nicky turns into Adrian during the kiss.  Adrian lets
     her go.  And we hear ADRIAN'S familiar laugh.

                    ADRIAN
          What?  No tongue?

     Adrian pulls his head back, his tongue is huge and he turns
     into a GIANT BAT.  He lets out a huge roar, then flies
     around, laughing, scaring people.

     Valerie runs over and picks up the flask.  She looks inside.

                    VALERIE
               (whispering)
          Nicky. Nicky.

     No response.

                    VALERIE (CONT'D)
          You gotta fly out...I know you can do
          it.
               (still no response)
          Do it for the butterflies.

     A long beat, then:

                    NICKY (O.S.)
          Butterflies...

     And Nicky shoots right out of the top of the flask and lands
     on his feet.  Adrian lands and stares down Nicky.  The clock
     is one minute from midnight.

     Adrian swoops down.  Nicky thinks quick and pulls out the
     BALL his Mom gave him and smashes it on the ground.  Out of
     it forms metal G-d: OZZY OSBORNE.

                    OZZY
          Hello, New York.

                    JOHN AND PETER
          Ozzy.

     They faint.

     The Bat's eyes go wide in fear.  Ozzy grabs the bat, his
     mouth grows big, and he bites the bat's head off.  Valerie
     hands Ozzy the flask.

                    VALERIE
          Put him in, Ozzy.

     Ozzy spits the bat head into the flask.

     EXT. CLOCK TOWER

     The clock reads: 00:23 seconds left.

     INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Dad is just a very thin pair of lips and one finger.  The
     FINGER is going up and down on the lips, making silly sounds.
     The Gatekeeper, the Monster, Jimmy the Demon and Lucifer are
     on their backs crying like babies.

     EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT

                    VALERIE
          Grand Central, Nicky.  Start running.

                    JOHN
          He'll never make it.

                    PETER
          You gotta kill yourself.

                    NICKY
          I'll just go to Heaven.

                    BEEFY
          No if you do something bad right before
          you die.

     PAUSE.  Everyone looks around.  Nicky spots Henry Winkler.

                    HENRY WINKLER
          Aw, man, not again.

                    NICKY
          Sorry, Henry.
               (focuses)
          Release the Evil.

     Henry is covered in bees once again.

     ON NICKY AND VALERIE

     Nicky picks up a big rock and hands it to Valerie.

                    NICKY (CONT'D)
          Do me.

                    VALERIE
          I love you.

                    NICKY
          I love you.

     Valerie smashes the rock on Nicky's head, killing him.

     ON CLOCK TOWER

     Six seconds left.

     INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     The lips and finger are slowing down.

     INT. GATES OF HELL - DAY

     Nicky triumphantly passes through the wall of fire and it
     starts burning again behind him.  And now all the BACKED UP
     SOULS fall out on top of Nicky.

     The Gatekeeper APPLAUDS.

     EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT

     The STAGE, the DEMONS and everything that raised from Hell
     now descends quickly into the ground.

     INT. THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

     Dad's lips form a body around it.  Dad FILLS IN.

     EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT

     The good people of New York cheer.  We see John, Peter, Todd,
     Valerie, Beefy and the Student, who of course is dancing
     seductively.

     EXT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS

     Angel is so proud.

                    ANGEL
          Okay, you just saw my son save the
          universe.  Right?!

     Everyone cheers.

     INT. THRONE ROOM - SHORTLY AFTER

     Dad and Nicky are hugging.

                    DAD
          You came through, Nicky.

                    NICKY
          I came through for you, Mom and the
          butterflies, Dad.

                    DAD
          You're back in Hell now, kid.  There's
          no butterflies here.  If you want
          butterflies, you need to be on Earth.

                    NICKY
          What about you and Grandpa and everyone
          in Hell?

                    DAD
          Nicky, I let my butterflies die once
          upon a time and it's never stopped
          hurting.
               (Dad looks up)
          That's right, you heard me, Holly.  I'm
          still in love with you.

     INT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - CONTINUOUS

     Angel is shocked.

                    ANGEL
          Oh my G-d.  He's totally talking about
          me.

     INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                    DAD
          And don't think I forgot about how crazy
          you get after a few daiquiris.

     INT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - CONTINUOUS

                    FRIEND
          That guy is still a horn dog.

     INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Dad turns to Nicky.

                    DAD
          Listen, I got down low.  Your mom's got
          up high.  You take care of the middle.

                    NICKY
          I will, Dad.  But in the words of Motley
          Crue, this will always be my...home
          sweet home...

     He pats him on the back.

                    JIMMY THE DEMON
          Sorry to interrupt guys, but it's time
          for Hitler's punishment.

                    LUCIFER
          Let me handle that.

     Lucifer walks over to the closet.

                    LUCIFER (CONT'D)
          And I'm not using a pineapple this time.

     He pulls out the flask.

                    ADRIAN (O.S.)
          No!

                    CASSIUS (O.S.)
          Don't do it!

     He shoves the flask up Hitler's ass.  Hitler's face tightens.

                    HITLER
          Holy Schnit!

     FREEZE FRAME, then:

                         DISSOLVE TO:

     ONE YEAR LATER

     Over the skyline of Manhattan.

     EXT. STREET - CENTRAL PARK WEST

     PAN UP from a moving baby stroller to reveal Nicky and
     Valerie both pushing it.  We see Beefy walking with them.
     Unbelievably happy.

     A nice OLD LADY bends down to the stroller.

                    LADY
          Oh...what an uncommonly beautiful baby.

                    VALERIE
          Thank yo.

                    LADY
          Such a little angel.

                    BEEFY
          Only a quarter, ma'am.

     She tickles the baby.  It giggles and a small stream of fire
     shoots out of his mouth and singes the Old Lady's eyebrows.

                    NICKY
          Zachariah, say you're sorry.

                    BABY ZACHARIAH
               (sounds like Nicky)
          Sorry.

     The Lady scurries away.  Nicky and Valerie laugh and continue
     walking in absolute bliss.  They pass the Preacher who runs
     towards us.

                    PREACHER
          He has spilled his seed!  He is
          multiplying!  Beware the progeny of the
          unholy union!  We're all gonna die!

     The Preacher runs straight into the camera.  BLACK.

                             THE END.
