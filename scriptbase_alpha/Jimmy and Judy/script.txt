                                                          CAMERA ON:
          
          I/E. BACKYARD - SUBURBAN HOUSE - JUDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          POV of a HOME VIDEO CAMERA shooting into the window of
          teenage girl's bedroom.
          
          The door inside opens. In walks JUDY OAKS-KELLEN (18), a
          blond haired, mousy girl, wearing only a T-shirt and panties.
          As she heads to the mirror we hear...
          
          Sound of skin smacking against skin and heavy breathing.
          Whoever operates the camera is definitely CHOAKIN' THE
          GOPHER.
          
          Judy combs her hair in the mirror, oblivious.
          
          The camera operator is in a whack off frenzy as he...
          
                                CAMERA OPERATOR (O.C.)
                    Oh, mmph.
          
          He's climaxed.
          
          The sounds have stopped, but the tape keeps rolling.    Judy
          stops combing her hair as...
          
          Camera shuts down.
          
                                                          CAMERA ON:
          
          EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - THE TRACK - DAY
          
          Camera shoots from inside a car hidden camera style as Judy
          runs laps during her gym class. Judy, again, has no idea
          that she is being filmed as camera zooms in tight.
          
          She's tired, sweating profusely, and looks completely
          miserable. She stops running, exhausted, as the other kids
          pass her.
          
          Suddenly, a very Butch looking female GYM TEACHER (40) walks
          over and begins BERATING Judy. The Gym Teacher's face turns
          red as she spews insults inches away from Judy's face.
          
          We can't hear what she's saying, but whatever it is, it's
          cruel, harsh, and very intense. Exhausted and humiliated,
          Judy holds back tears as...
          
          Camera shuts down.
          
                                                          CAMERA ON:
          
                                                                      2.
          
          
          
          I/E. JIMMY'S HOUSE - BACKYARD/KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - DUSK
          
          Late summer evening. Camera Operator wipes dirt from the
          lens with his shirt revealing his face for the first time as
          he looks at camera. This is the first time we get even a
          glimpse of JIMMY WRIGHT (21). His looks are striking, even a
          bit awkward, but not at all unappealing.
          
          He throws a mischievously evil look at the lens, then settles
          his face back to normal. He spins the camera away, pointing
          it at the back of his house.
          
          Through the kitchen window, Jimmy zooms in on his mother
          (JIMMY'S MOM) (40's) idyllic version of a mom in new
          millennium suburban housewife clothes. She's on the phone,
          preparing dinner.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Hey Mom, heard you and Dad doing
                    the nasty last night. Thanks for
                    that one. By the way, who the fuck
                    is Nancy?
          
          Camera whips over to JIMMY'S DAD in the LIVING ROOM, well
          dressed, rich looking and fat in his late 40's, watching
          baseball on TV, tired after a long day's work. He drinks
          from a tumbler of expensive scotch neat with an ice cube,
          munching on mixed nuts from a crystal bowl.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Hey Dad, Mom's on the phone telling
                    her friends that you're hung like a
                    light switch.
          
          Dad reaches into his pants to give his balls a good scratch.
          Jimmy gives the play by play like a baseball announcer.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Oh Daddy, there he goes. He makes
                    the reach and... yes! Both balls
                    at the same time! One heck of a
                    double play!
          
          Eyes on the TV, Dad takes his hands out of his pants and
          sniffs them.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    And the sniff to finish it off.
          
          Satisfied, Dad reaches in and grabs a handful of nuts as he
          continues to watch TV. We zoom out to see both Mom and Dad,
          each through different windows.
          
                                                                     3.
          
          
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Fucking freak show.
          
                                                           CAMERA ON:
          
          INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Dark and in silhouette, Jimmy flips on the camera by remote.
          It's too dark to see faces or bodies with any detail, but
          Jimmy's clearly having sex with a PROSTITUTE in his bed. She
          is young, black, and looks very much like a prostitute.
          
          As he pounds into her...
          
                              JIMMY
                    Do you like that nigger?   Come on
                    nigger, do you like it?
          
                              PROSTITUTE
                        (humors him)
                    Oh yeah baby, I like it.
          
          By remote, Jimmy shuts down the camera.
          
                                                           CAMERA ON:
          
          INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Jimmy's behind   the camera interviewing the Prostitute who
          sits up in his   bed holding the sheets to cover herself. With
          the lights on,   we can see that she's clearly unattractive.
          Jimmy asks his   questions with a gentle confidence.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Okay, so. What was going through
                    your mind when I called you a
                    nigger?
          
                              PROSTITUTE
                    This costs you an extra fifty.
          
                                JIMMY (O.C.)
                    I know.
          
          She pauses. You can tell she just wants to leave, but is
          toughing it out for the extra fifty bucks.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Well, what did it feel like?
          
          Long pause.
          
                                                                      4.
          
          
          
                                 PROSTITUTE
                       It felt like nothing.
          
                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                       What do you mean?
          
                                 PROSTITUTE
                       You ain't the first person to call
                       me a nigger when we was fucking.
          
                                   JIMMY (O.C.)
                             (not surprised)
                       Oh.
          
                                 PROSTITUTE
                       Johns call me nigger all the time.
                       Especially white guys. Nothing
                       new. Just dirty talk.
          
          Long, awkward pause.      Jimmy Doesn't know what to say.
          
                                   PROSTITUTE
                       That it?
          
          No reply from Jimmy.
          
                                 PROSTITUTE
                       What about you? You like calling
                       me nigger? You get your nut off?
          
                                   JIMMY (O.C.)
                             (calmly)
                       No.
          
                                 PROSTITUTE
                       Then why'd ya call me that?
          
                                 JIMMY (O.C.) (O.C.)
                       Have you ever wondered what it was
                       like to treat someone so completely
                       cruel that it was unthinkable?
          
          No answer.
          
                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                       I was trying to do the unthinkable
                       and unimaginable when I called you
                       that. I wanted to see if was even
                       possible for me to do that.
          
          They pause.
          
                                                           5.
          
          
          
                                PROSTITUTE
                    Yeah, so?
          
          Jimmy speaks softly and confidently.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    I think I want to die. Like I
                    don't deserve to live anymore.   And
                    that I will never want to do
                    something like that to someone
                    again.
          
          The prostitute finds Jimmy's answer endearing.
          
                              PROSTITUTE
                    Why ya wanna die?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Because everyone hates me.
          
          Pause.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    They hate me because I seek beauty
                    and appreciate destruction. They
                    hate my mind, my thoughts, my
                    imagination. They hate everything
                    about me. And I hate them.
          
                              PROSTITUTE
                        (trying not to care)
                    Really?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Yep. Everyone. Everyone that
                    knows or who has ever met me.
          
                              PROSTITUTE
                    Your parents don't hate you. Look
                    at this room in this big 'ole house
                    you got.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    My parents provide me with food and
                    shelter because they have been
                    conditioned by society into
                    thinking it's the appropriate thing
                    to do. In reality they can't stand
                    to be in the same room with me.
                    They're fascists, brainwashed, and
                    unforgiving.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                    6.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.) (cont'd)
                    They dismiss my feelings of ill
                    regard towards them on simple
                    rebelliousness of youth, but that's
                    only because they are patently and
                    intentionally unaware of their own
                    hypocrisies.
          
          Prostitute looks bored/frustrated again.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                        (accidental condescension)
                    Do you understand me?
          
                              PROSTITUTE
                    You wanna know what I think?
          
                              JIMMY
                    Yes, I really do.
          
                              PROSTITUTE
                    I think you're a spoiled ass white
                    boy, thinks you everything, but you
                    don't know shit. All you do is
                    bullshit complain and there's folks
                    out there that'd kill for all this.
          
          Jimmy doesn't react.
          
                              PROSTITUTE
                    I don't feel sorry for you.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                        (calmly)
                    No one is asking you to.   Thank you
                    for letting me film you.
          
          Camera turns off.
          
                                                           CAMERA ON:
          
          I/E. HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT/JIMMY'S CAR - DAY
          
          Jimmy hides hidden camera style inside his car in the high
          school parking lot, bleachers in the distance. School is
          letting out as he zooms in on Judy.
          
          She's looking at the ground as she's taunted by a group of
          Other Harassing Teenagers, a tear streaming down the side of
          her cheek.
          
          Suddenly, Judy is bashed in the face with a school bag. She
          falls to the ground, then picks up her broken glasses as
          camera zooms out to catch the Girl who hit her (Mean Girl).
          
                                                                   7.
          
          
          
          Nearby, a big, Dumb Looking Bully Type (18) taunts her as she
          cries. His taunts are biting and as excessive as the Mean
          Girl's, then he dumps a cup of soda on Judy's head as she's
          crying.
          
          Judy screams at the top of her lungs. The group runs off
          laughing. Jimmy whip pans to the Mean Girl as she laughs
          with her friends, then whips pans back to Judy, now on her
          feet, blood running from her nose and onto her white shirt.
          
          Camera shuts down.
          
                                                         CAMERA ON:
          
          I/E. JUDY'S HOUSE - JUDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          A scene we've seen before. Jimmy is off camera videotaping
          Judy through her bedroom window. We hear him FLOGGIN' THE
          DOLPHIN off screen while Judy combs her hair in the mirror.
          She stops when she hears...
          
          A Grown Man, (45), walks into the doorway of her bedroom.
          This is JUDY'S DAD. He comes in and doesn't say a thing to
          her. Judy doesn't acknowledge him at all and continues
          combing her hair as though he's not even there.
          
          He comes up behind her, then wraps his arms around her,
          giving her a warm hug from behind. Something's not right.
          The masturbation sounds STOP.
          
          Judy's noticeably uncomfortable but doesn't resist as her
          Father begins kissing her neck. His hand slowly creeps down
          to her pelvic area, his other hand turning out the bedroom
          light. The room goes dark.
          
          Camera flips down, then OFF...
          
          Then COMES BACK ON AGAIN
          
          Once again we're looking through the camera pointing at the
          window, but now it's the distorted, grainy, black and white
          of "Nite Shot" mode. Though we see the Judy's mirror and her
          dresser, she and her Father are nowhere to be found.
          
          Whatever's going on between them, it's going on out of frame,
          away from the view of the window. Camera shuts down.
          
                                                         CAMERA ON:
          
                                                                       8.
          
          
          
          INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Jimmy films once again, hidden camera style, long lens from
          far away. Frame is close on Judy sitting at the dining room
          table.
          
          As camera pulls back, we HEAR but don't see Judy's Parents
          talking to Jimmy's Mom and Dad at the table. Judy is bored,
          completely uninterested in their conversation.
          
                              JIMMY'S MOM (O.C.)
                    So Melissa talked Gary into the SL
                    instead of the seven series. I
                    couldn't believe it.
          
          Judy looks over at camera, catching the fact that she's being
          videotaped. Jimmy keeps filming.
          
                              JIMMY'S DAD (O.C.)
                    They paid way too much.
          
          As Jimmy zooms in, she clandestinely flips off the camera.
          
                              JUDY'S DAD
                    I strictly buy American anyway.
          
          Judy gets up.   Her mom stops her.
          
                              JUDY'S MOM (O.C.)
                    Where you going honey?
          
                                JUDY
                    Bathroom.
          
          As Judy leaves the table she walks towards camera as it shuts
          down.
          
                                                         CAMERA ON:
          
          INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Judy sits on Jimmy's bed, staring into the camera.   She's
          uncomfortable sitting there. It's poorly framed.
          
                              JUDY
                    Can we start already?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    One second.
          
          Camera shuts off.
          
                                                                       9.
          
          
          
          INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BEDROOM - DAY
          
          Jimmy films Judy again, better framing this time.      Judy looks
          annoyed and uncomfortable in front of the camera.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Who do you hate most in the world
                    and why?
          
                              JUDY
                        (kind of bitchy)
                    Why? Who cares?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    I do.
          
                              JUDY
                    God, I just wanted to come up here
                    to say "hi" and get away from my
                    parents' bullshit for like two
                    seconds and you have to put the
                    stupid camera in my face.
          
          Jimmy takes delight in Judy's displeasure of being filmed.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Now we're onto something.
          
          Judy wants to go and then doesn't.
          
                              JUDY
                    You're weird Jimmy. You were weird
                    when we were kids and now you're
                    just getting weirder.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Is that why you had a crush on me?
          
                              JUDY
                        (scoffs)
                    Yeah right.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    You didn't have a crush on me?
          
          Judy fidgets, he's got her.
          
                              JUDY
                    You're a loser. You're twenty one
                    and you're still living with your
                    parents.
          
          She's waiting for a response.    Jimmy doesn't bite.
          
                                                             10.
          
          
          
                              JUDY
                    I heard that you got kicked out of
                    college because you tried to talk
                    your roommate into killing himself.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Where'd you hear that?
          
                              JUDY
                    From everyone.
          
          Jimmy waits.   Judy's curious how he'll respond.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    You wanna know the truth?
          
                               JUDY
                    Yeah.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    He asked me if he should kill
                    himself. I told him to look inside
                    himself for the answer. I didn't
                    tell him to. I didn't tell him not
                    to. I said he shouldn't be afraid
                    of the unknown. If he was going to
                    kill himself, I wanted him to do it
                    for the right reasons.
          
                              JUDY
                    I swear to God, you're a fucking
                    psycho.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Like you're normal.
          
                              JUDY
                    More than you.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    If I'm such a freak, what are you
                    doing in my room?
          
                              JUDY
                    I was bored.
          
          Jimmy waits, assessing the situation.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    I wanna show you something?
          
                                                                   11.
          
          
          
          Judy looks up at the camera.   Before she can answer, camera
          shuts down.
          
                                                          CAMERA ON:
          
          INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Judy sits on the edge of Jimmy's bed facing a television set.
          Jimmy films from behind her so he gets Judy's back and the
          television in the shot. The screen is static.
          
                              JUDY
                    I can't believe I'm doing this.
          
          Nothing's happening.   Judy's getting antsy.
          
                              JUDY
                        (offended; turns to
                         camera)
                    Can you start the tape?
          
          Jimmy clicks the VCR with his remote, as Judy turns back to
          watch. On TV, static flips to black.
          
                              JUDY
                    Don't think this means I like you
                    or anything.
          
          A few seconds.   Nothing on TV yet.
          
                              JUDY
                    And as soon as this is over I'm
                    going back downstairs.
          
          An image flips on the TV.

          EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - TEACHER'S PARKING LOT - (ON JIMMY'S TV) -
          DAY
          
          Someone (Jimmy) has placed the camera on the ground and is
          facing a car in a parking lot at school.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                        (in bedroom)
                    That's Mrs. Holzclaw's car. She's
                    your P.E. teacher, right? I hated
                    her too.
          
          Jimmy enters frame and punches a Butterfly Knife into the
          sidewall of Mrs. Holzclaw's car sending air HISSING as the
          tire sinks.
          
                                                                   12.
          
          
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    And Bill McAllister... I went to
                    school with his brother. They're
                    both dicks.
          
          Tape cuts to...
          
          EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - ENTRANCE (ON JIMMY'S TV) - DAY
          
          On TV, hidden camera style (long lens from a distance) the
          Dumb Looking Bully Type (Bill McAllister) is taken out of
          school in cuffs into a waiting Squad Car.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                        (in bedroom)
                    I planted an ounce of weed in his
                    locker then sent an anonymous
                    letter to Principal Lipsky.
          
          EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - ENTRANCE (ON JIMMY'S TV) - DAY
          
          Same location, different day. On TV, again hidden camera
          style, a girl is being rolled out of the school on a
          stretcher. It's the Mean Girl, the one who smacked Judy in
          the face with her school bag.
          
          She's placed into an ambulance.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    I took care of her too.
          
          Jimmy clicks the television set off with his remote.
          
          END JIMMY'S REVENGE TAPE
          
          INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BEDROOM - DAY
          
          The TV is off. All we see is Judy's back. She hasn't once
          turned around to face the camera during any of the clips.
          
          She sits still.
          
          She trembles but doesn't turn around. She collects herself
          but still doesn't turn around. Jimmy holds the camera
          steady.
          
          Still she doesn't turn around.
          
          She fidgets in her seat but still doesn't turn around.
          
          She now sits still on the edge of the bed like she is in a
          trance, but still doesn't turn around to face the camera.
          
                                                                   13.
          
          
          
          No movement.
          
          No movement.
          
          No movement.
          
          She begins to breath heavily.
          
          Then no movement.
          
          She leans her head down towards the floor.
          
          Then no movement.
          
          Still no movement or any reaction for that matter.   It's like
          she is in a trance and can't wake up.
          
          Jimmy (O.C.) continues to roll without budging.
          
          Still no movement.
          
          It looks like she's about to turn around. She moves her head
          in the direction of the camera, then assumes her original
          position facing the TV.
          
          Then... no movement.
          
          Still no movement.
          
          Then Judy collapses onto the bed. Jimmy, still rolling, gets
          off the bed and begins filming her as she lies on the floor
          crying hysterically.
          
          Judy cries and cries and cries and cries. She then lets out
          a cry from the depths of her soul. The cry is long, hard,
          and loud.
          
          Jimmy gets up, then stands above her with the camera.
          
          She rolls over on her back and is now facing directly into
          the camera. She tries to collect herself.
          
                              JUDY
                    Why did you do that?
          
                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                    I had to.
          
                                 JUDY
                    Why?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    I did it for you.
          
                                                                    14.
          
          
          
                                JUDY
                      I don't understand.
          
          Judy tries hard to stop, but just sobs harder and louder than
          before.
          
                                JUDY
                      Please tell me.
          
                                JIMMY (O.C.)
                      I felt like if I didn't save you
                      then no one else would.
          
                                JUDY
                          (screams)
                      Please turn off the FUCKING CAMERA!
          
          A muffled voice comes through the door from downstairs.
          
                                JIMMY'S DAD (O.C.)
                      Jimmy! What the hell are you guys
                      doing up there?
          
          Judy stops, realizing suddenly that she's been screaming.
          
          Camera shuts down.
          
                                                            CAMERA ON:
          
          INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - STAIRWAY/ENTRYWAY/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Jimmy's behind the camera. He stands at the head of the
          stairs shooting down. Sounds of a dinner party just getting
          started come from downstairs. He walks down the steps into
          the party.
          
          A generic "Happy Twentieth Anniversary" sign hangs above the
          front door. Camera pans awkwardly to a lame K-Mart style
          studio portrait on the wall. It's Jimmy's parents wearing
          saccharine sweet smiles, Dad's hair slicked back, Mom in an
          overdone hair-do and in way too colorful clothing.
          
          Gifts sit on the entry-way table. Party Guests are dressed
          nicely and are mingling in the house, drinks in hand. Dinner
          is yet to start. As Jimmy moves into the...
          
          ENTRY-WAY
          
          People at the party all turn to camera, a look of shock on
          their faces as Jimmy walks through.
          
          More and more people react with gasps and revulsion at
          camera, but we can't tell why. Jimmy moves camera to the...
          
                                                                   15.
          
          
          
          LIVING ROOM
          
          The place is full of More Party Guests. Frame moves across a
          huge mirror on the wall over a cocktail bar. We catch a
          glimpse of Jimmy's image and realize...
          
          Jimmy is completely NAKED and has PAINTED HIS ENTIRE BODY
          SILVER.
          
          Camera quickly turns away from the mirror as some people run
          from the room.
          
          One of the Female Party Guests (#1) SCREAMS.
          
                               FEMALE PARTY GUEST #1
                        (covers her mouth)
                    Oh my God!
          
          Jimmy keeps filming, catching people's reactions.
          
          He points the camera at a Female Party Guest #2.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Hey, great party, huh? I'm making
                    a tape for my parents. Want to say
                    something to them?
          
          Female Party Guest #2 is just too stunned to speak.
          
                              JIMMY'S MOM (O.C.)
                    Jimmy!
          
          Jimmy turns the camera at his mother who is completely
          shocked to see him like this.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Hey Mom. Happy anniversary. You
                    want to say anything to yourself?
          
                              JIMMY'S DAD
                    That's enough.
          
          Jimmy's Dad runs into the room and throws a blanket over
          Jimmy's head, body and the camera. All we see is black and
          flashes of light from under the blanket.
          
                              JIMMY'S DAD (O.C.)
                        (muffled)
                    Get out! Now!
          
                                                                  16.
          
          
          
          Camera's under the blanket as we hear Jimmy's Dad pushes him
          from the room. Camera shuts down.
          
                                                         CAMERA ON:
          
          INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Camera is being removed from the camera bag. As the lens
          pans quickly, we catch a glimpse of Jimmy smirking, holding
          the camera. He's way too close to the lens.
          
          He flips it around until it locks on DR. WALTERS, MFCC (40),
          Jimmy's not very accomplished therapist. Walters seems to
          have a very gentle and nonthreatening aura that suggests he's
          the type of person you would feel comfortable talking to. He
          sits by the window in his relatively uninteresting office.
          Jimmy has turned on the camera in the middle of their first
          session together.
          
                              DR. WALTERS
                    Jimmy, we discussed this. You
                    can't tape our sessions. It's not
                    allowed.
          
          The camera doesn't move.
          
                              DR. WALTERS
                    You know, you can't film someone
                    who doesn't want their image and
                    voice recorded. Technically,
                    you're actually breaking the law.
          
          Jimmy (O.C.) doesn't respond.
          
                              DR. WALTERS
                    Does your defiance make you feel
                    more powerful?
          
          Still no answer.
          
                              DR. WALTERS
                    Filming people makes you feel like
                    you're in control of the situation
                    doesn't it?
          
          Still no answer.
          
                              DR. WALTERS
                    I can sit here as long as you can.
                    You're not going to be able to
                    force me to participate in your
                    little game here.
          
                                                                    17.
          
          
          
          No movement from the camera.
          
                               DR. WALTERS
                     Jimmy, this isn't something that
                     friends do to each other is it?
          
          Dr. Walters sits in front of the camera, trying to stay
          perfectly still and calm.
          
          Dr. Walters is so nice and so calm, that we start to feel
          sorry for him.
          
          No movement.
          
          No movement.
          
          Dr. Walters fidgets.
          
          Then holds still.
          
          Then fidgets, trying to stay calm.
          
                               DR. WALTERS
                     Jimmy, put the camera away, please.
          
          No movement.
          
                               DR. WALTERS
                     You're wasting your time and mine,
                     Jimmy. We could be doing something
                     productive.
          
          The camera shakes a bit.     Jimmy's laughing.
          
          Dr. Walters is doing his best to stay calm.
          
                               DR. WALTERS
                     That's enough.
          
          No movement.
          
                               DR. WALTERS
                     Put it away.
          
          Nothing.
          
                                  DR. WALTERS
                     Now Jimmy!
          
          Dr. Walters gets up and comes towards the camera.   He grabs
          it just above the lens and tries to take it away.
          
                                                                      18.
          
          
          
                              DR. WALTERS
                    Come on Jimmy.
          
          A fierce battle of tug of war breaks out.      We see Dr. Walters
          becoming increasingly pissed off.
          
          The back and forth is suddenly getting violent, until...
          
                              DR. WALTERS
                    Gimme the Goddamn fucking camera!
          
          Dr. Walters finally gets the camera free from Jimmy.     Camera
          shuts off.
          
                                                             CAMERA ON:
          
          INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BEDROOM/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Jimmy's behind the camera, moving quickly down the hall to...
          
          JIMMY'S BEDROOM
          
          Judy is sitting on his bed.   She sees Jimmy come in with the
          camera and freaks out.
          
                             JUDY
                    No. No filming.     I'm leaving, I
                    swear.
          
          Judy gets up to go.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Okay, okay. Wait.
          
          As Jimmy gets up to stop her, camera shuts off.
          
                                                             CAMERA ON:
          
          INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BEDROOM - DAY
          
          Jimmy is filming Judy, who is sitting on his bed. Her face
          is red, her eyes have watered up, and her nose is snotty and
          running from after an intense session of crying. Jimmy is
          catching her seconds after she's has finally composed
          herself.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Say what you said to me before.
          
                              JUDY
                    I don't know how I said it.
          
                                                        19.
          
          
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Paraphrase it then.
          
                                 JUDY
                    Do what?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Say it like you did before but it
                    doesn't have to be exactly the
                    same.
          
                              JUDY
                    You mean paraphrase it.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    That's what I said.
          
                              JUDY
                    I didn't hear you.
          
          Judy stares off camera.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Are you ready?
          
                              JUDY
                    I'm waiting for you.
          
                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                    OK.
          
                              JUDY
                    Tell me when.
          
                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Now.
          
                              JUDY
                    You want me to paraphrase it?
          
                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                           (impatient)
                    Yes!
          
          Judy thinks for a beat.
          
                              JUDY
                    I can't remember what I said.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Then just ad-lib.
          
                                                                  20.
          
          
          
                                JUDY
                    Ad-lib?
          
                                JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Yes.
          
          Judy thinks for a beat.
          
                              JUDY
                    I don't know what that means.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                        (getting frustrated)
                    It means make it up.
          
                              JUDY
                        (confused)
                    Do you want me to make something up
                    or paraphrase what I did the first
                    time?
          
          This isn't working.   The camera drops from Judy.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Let's take a break.
          
          Camera shuts down.
          
                                                          CAMERA ON:
          
          INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BEDROOM - DAY
          
          Camera's on a tripod. Jimmy sits in a chair, the back of his
          shoulder foregrounds Judy.
          
                              JUDY
                    I'm not good on camera.    It makes
                    me nervous.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Forget about the camera.   Talk to
                    me.
          
                                JUDY
                    OK.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Tell me what you said earlier.
                    About me about how you felt when
                    you saw the video.
          
                                                                       21.
          
          
          
                                 JUDY
                           (relaxes)
                       It felt like someone had been
                       reading my mind.
          
          She stops.
          
                                 JIMMY
                       Go on.
          
                                  JUDY
                       It was like someone had jumped into
                       my head and watched what was being
                       projected.
          
          Now Judy completely has forgotten that the camera is there.
          
                                 JIMMY
                       And earlier, what you said about
                       God.
          
          Jimmy zooms in the camera by remote.    Judy's distracted.
          
                                 JIMMY
                           (off her look)
                       Tell me.
          
          Judy refocuses.
          
                                 JUDY
                       I said that it felt like God had
                       sent someone to protect me, and to
                       look out for me.
          
          She looks at Jimmy as if he is an angel.
          
                                 JUDY
                       And I said that you are the only
                       person in my life who has ever
                       looked after me like that.
          
          Judy tries to stifle tears, but they're starting to flow
          again. As camera zooms in further, Judy catches sight of
          Jimmy's finger on the remote and BLOWS HER FUCKING TOP,
          leaping from her chair.
          
                                 JUDY
                       God, I hate it when you film me
                       crying!
          
          Judy goes for the camera, struggling to get it off the
          tripod, she finally frees it and points it at Jimmy.
          
                                                                      22.
          
          
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    How do you like it, huh? How do
                    you like having a camera shoved
                    right up your ass?
          
          Camera's framed poorly, moves around a lot, goes in and out
          of focus, etc.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Do you like it? Do you?
          
                              JIMMY
                    I don't like it or dislike.   I'm
                    used to it.
          
          Judy moves the camera directly in his face. The lens is
          millimeters away from his nose. We see an extreme close up
          of his nostrils.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Generally I'd place the camera
                    further away from my nose, but if
                    this is your preferred shooting
                    style then I guess I'll have to
                    adjust to it.
          
          Jimmy leans in and rests his nose on the lens.
          
                              JIMMY
                    How's this work for you?
          
          Judy pulls back and continues filming him.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Give me a break.
          
                              JIMMY
                    OK.
          
          Now Judy's the interviewer.   Her framing is not quite as
          adept as Jimmy's.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    So... why do you have to film
                    everything?
          
                              JIMMY
                    I don't film everything.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Why do you like to film me crying?
          
                                                                    23.
          
          
          
                                JIMMY
                    I don't.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Then why do you?
          
                              JIMMY
                    Because it's rare that I get to
                    find someone that lets their
                    emotions go. When a person is
                    crying, I mean truly crying, or
                    truly laughing or smiling or
                    frowning or gasping. For a few
                    seconds or minutes I get a chance
                    to see that person's soul. And
                    really, now that you've forced me
                    to think about it. I think it's a
                    very rare and beautiful thing to be
                    afforded that opportunity.
          
          Judy is shaken and speechless.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Anything else?
          
          Judy's moved and forgets herself.   Camera drops from Jimmy.
          
                                JUDY (O.C.)
                    Why me?
          
          Jimmy helps her put the camera back up on him.
          
                                JIMMY
                    Because.
          
          Jimmy sits still.    Judy doesn't know what to do with that.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Why do you think?
          
          Judy doesn't have an answer.
          
          Jimmy reaches forward and takes the camera away from her and
          turns the interview around.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Why you and why me? Why are we
                    together right now?
          
          Judy doesn't know what to say.
          
                                                                    24.
          
          
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Go ahead say it. I want you to.     I
                    know what you're going to say so
                    just say it.
          
                                 JUDY
                    Stop.
          
                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                        (soft)
                    Tell me.
          
          Judy fidgets.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                        (bullies her)
                    Tell me!
          
          Judy fidgets again, then...
          
                              JUDY
                        (blows her top)
                    Because we're both fucking weird!
          
          Judy pauses. The pressure of the camera from Jimmy makes her
          feel like she has to give him more.
          
                              JUDY
                    Because we're the two weirdest kids
                    in the world. And God made us for
                    each other and I fucking love you,
                    and you did all this because you
                    love me too, and fuck everyone and
                    everything that doesn't get it!
          
          Judy's out of breath.    Camera still points at her.
          
                              JUDY
                    That's right, right?
          
          Judy stares back at the camera, longing for an answer from
          Jimmy. She told him she loved him. Camera shuts down.
          
                                                            CAMERA ON:
          
          I/E. HIGHWAY FIRST-KISS-SMILEY-FACE/JIMMY'S CAR - DAY
          
          Jimmy is driving in his car with Judy in the passenger seat.
          Judy has the camera and she is interviewing Jimmy as he
          drives.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Where are you taking me?
          
                                                          25.
          
          
          
                              JIMMY
                    To a beautiful place.
          
                                 JUDY (O.C.)
                    Where?
          
                              JIMMY
                    Chuck E. Cheese.
          
          Judy and Jimmy laugh together.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    No seriously.
          
                              JIMMY
                    I can't tell you.    It'll ruin it.
          
                                 JUDY (O.C.)
                    Fine.
          
          Judy sulks for a second.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Jimmy, can I ask you something?
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Anything.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Do you hate your parents?
          
                              JIMMY
                    Yes, but I understand them.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    What's to understand?
          
                              JIMMY
                    Lots of things.
          
                                 JUDY (O.C.)
                    Like what?
          
                              JIMMY
                    I understand that my ascension into
                    young adulthood triggered their
                    descent into mid-life crisis.
                    Generally when an only child leaves
                    the nest, the parents begin
                    reassessing their own lives. They
                    see us as a younger, better version
                    of themselves.

                              JIMMY (cont'd)
                    They feel abandoned by our need for
                    privacy and insecure because we no
                    longer seek their approval. They
                    used to take us to baseball games
                    and cover our scrapes with
                    bandages, but once we no longer
                    need Mom to nurture our bruises or
                    Dad to be our hero it puts their
                    roles and subsequent sense of self
                    worth into question.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    How do you know all these things?
          
                              JIMMY
                    When you don't have any friends,
                    don't play sports, don't go out,
                    have no one talk to, nowhere to go,
                    no one to listen to you, or no one
                    to help you figure things out, you
                    sort of have to figure things out
                    by yourself. And without any of
                    those things I have nothing but
                    time to think about stuff.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    You are SO smart.
          
                              JIMMY
                    You are so beautiful.
          
          Long pause.   Judy doesn't know how to react.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    You think I'm pretty?
          
                              JIMMY
                    I think you're the most beautiful
                    person I have ever met. The most
                    beautiful person in the universe.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    No one has ever told me that.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Get used to hearing it.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Do you think I'm smart?
          
                               JIMMY
                    Yes.
          
                                                                  27.
          
          
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Do you think I'm fat?
          
                                JIMMY
                    Yes.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    How could you say that? I only way
                    a hundred and ten pounds.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you said
                    flat. As in flat chested.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    I am not FLAT!
          
          Judy smacks him.
          
                                JIMMY
                    Prove it.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    I don't have to prove it.   Here
                    look.
          
          O.C., Judy is sticking her chest out for Jimmy. He looks
          away from the road to stare, her breasts filling out her top
          nicely.
          
                              JIMMY
                    I still can't tell.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    I wear a full B cup.
          
                                JIMMY
                    Show me.    Take em out.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    I am not going to take them out!
                    You take yours out.
          
                              JIMMY
                    It's already out.
          
          Judy tilts the camera down.
          
          IN A FLASH we see a lifelike dildo sticking out of Jimmy's
          fly, a smiley face sticker covers the head. The camera
          quickly shakes and spins off the image as Judy screams bloody
          fucking murder.
          
                                                                    28.
          
          
          
          Jimmy laughs. Judy forgets the camera is on. She drops it
          into her lap, fabric from her clothes covers the frame.
          
          We can hear Jimmy and Judy laughing hysterically.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    I can't believe you did that.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    That's why I did it. Now come on.
                    I showed you mine, let me see
                    yours.
          
          We hear the rustling of Judy's clothing. Camera falls to her
          feet on the floor of the car. There's silence. Off camera,
          Judy's nervously showing Jimmy her breasts.
          
                                JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Wow.    Give me the camera.
          
                                JUDY (O.C.)
                    No.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Please, pretty, pretty please with
                    sugar on top.
          
          Judy grabs the camera. It's pointing in Jimmy's direction,
          but she still doesn't realize it's on.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Here, I'll pull over.
          
          Jimmy pulls over to the side of the road then takes the
          camera. Jimmy frames up Judy.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Let me see 'em.
          
          Judy has a naughty and flirtatious smile.
          
          In the blink of an eye she suddenly lifts up her shirt and
          exposes her bra, then pulls her shirt back down.
          
          Jimmy protests.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    That doesn't count. Come on, for
                    real this time.
          
                              JUDY
                    I'm embarrassed.
          
                                                                    29.
          
          
          
                                JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Don't be.    You can trust me.
          
          Judy's not sure.   Jimmy looks into her eyes, pouring it on.
          
                               JIMMY (O.C.)
                    You can. You can trust me with
                    your life.
          
          Judy looks at him with a sense of admiration then hope.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                        (gently)
                    Please.
          
          Judy gets the same sexy, naughty smile and lifts up her shirt
          exposing the bra, keeping it there.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Will you take off your bra?
          
          Judy looks nervous but gives in. She unhooks her bra from
          the front and exposes her naked breasts for as long as she
          can. Jimmy focusses the camera's attention on them. It's
          too much for her. She quickly pulls her shirt back down.
          
          Jimmy tilts up to a close up of Judy's face.
          
                              JUDY
                        (struggling)
                    I just realized something.
          
          Judy's eyes are starting to well up as she tries not to cry.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    What's the matter?
          
                              JUDY
                    I just showed you my breasts and I
                    saw your penis and we haven't even
                    kissed.
          
          She starts tearing up.
          
                              JUDY
                    You haven't even asked me to be
                    your girlfriend and I did that.
                    I'm a slut.
                        (wiping her eyes)
                    I don't want to be a slut.
          
          Jimmy sees she's crying.
          
                                                                   30.
          
          
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Will you be my girlfriend?
          
                              JUDY
                    Yes.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Can I kiss you?
          
                              JUDY
                        (sniffling)
                    Yes. Will you turn off the camera?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    I want this moment to be captured
                    forever. I'd rather not kiss you
                    at all than waste the opportunity
                    to document the most beautiful
                    moment of my life.
          
          Judy leans towards Jimmy, then suddenly attacks him and
          shoves the camera to the side. They are making out
          exuberantly. The camera shakes and wobbles. We can hear
          heavy breathing and the two of them smashing up against the
          interior of the car.
          
          Jimmy finally has the camera in position. He has one of his
          arms extended and now we can see the two of them kissing.
          
          Judy's devouring him in that raging teenage hormone sort of
          way.
          
                              JUDY
                        (whispers)
                    I wanna see your smiley face again.
          
          We see and hear Judy whispering, her lips placed gently on
          the inside of Jimmy's ear.
          
                              JUDY
                        (whispering)
                    Turn the camera off. Turn the
                    camera off. Turn it off.
          
          Camera goes off.
          
                                                          CAMERA ON:
          
          I/E. HIGHWAY FIRST-KISS-SMILEY-FACE/JIMMY'S CAR - DAY
          
          Judy films Jimmy driving the car.   He has a huge shit eating
          grin on his face.
          
                                                                   31.
          
          
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    How do you feel?
          
                              JIMMY
                    Relaxed, happy, confident, studly,
                    excited, relieved, delighted... I
                    love you Judy.
          
                               JUDY (O.C.)
                    You do?
          
                              JIMMY
                    Very much so. I always have.
          
                               JUDY (O.C.)
                    Me too.
          
          Long pause filled with sexual tension takes over.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Do you want to pull over again?
          
          Jimmy smiles.   Of course he does.   Camera goes off.
          
                                                           CAMERA ON:
          
          EXT. BEAUTIFUL FARM - SHOTGUN SCENE - DAY
          
          Judy films Jimmy as he FIRES a twelve gage pump action shot
          gun off into the distance. After each shot he pumps then
          FIRES again.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Are you getting this?
          
          No response.
          
          Jimmy FIRES another shot. His muscles are flexing as he
          pumps the gage. He looks extremely violent and determined.
          
                               JIMMY
                    Come on.   Are you getting this?
          
          A very turned off Judy replies.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    This is where you wanted to take
                    me?
          
                              JIMMY
                    Yeah, what's the matter?
          
          We can hear Judy crying.   The camera shakes out of control.
          
                                                                     32.
          
          
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    I wanna go home.
          
          Jimmy looks over towards the camera/Judy. He knows that he's
          fucked up and he feels like complete shit.
          
          Jimmy walks over to her, takes the camera and shuts it off.
          
                                                             CAMERA ON:
          
          INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Jimmy is standing in front of a mirror and is videotaping his
          own reflection.
          
          He is talking to himself and into the camera.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Don't fuck this up.    Please don't
                    fuck this up.
          
          Now he is pleading with himself.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Just try to be normal.
                        (screaming)
                    Just be normal! God damn it why do
                    you have to fuck everything up?
          
          He hasn't convinced himself.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Be normal.     Be normal.   Be normal!
          
          Jimmy takes a breath, then shuts the camera down.
          
                                                             CAMERA ON:
          
          INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Jimmy films Judy who lies next to him in the bed. Her face
          is sweaty and red and he is still a tad out of breath. Jimmy
          is capturing her literally seconds after they had sex.
          
          She's somewhat bewildered, then she notices the camera.
          She's starting to get used to it.
          
                                JUDY
                          (big smile)
                    Hi.
          
                                                                   33.
          
          
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    So how do you feel now, right at
                    this moment?
          
          Judy just sighs, basking in the afterglow.
          
                              JUDY
                    I don't know.
                        (trying)
                    That was soooo good.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    You were good. What got into you?
          
                              JUDY
                    I don't know. I've just really
                    been wanting you lately. Really
                    bad.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Why's that?
          
          Judy chuckles.
          
                              JUDY
                    I'm embarrassed.    I can't say.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Now you have to tell me.
          
                              JUDY
                    It was after yesterday.
          
          Jimmy is more than surprised.
          
                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Yesterday?
          
          Judy speaks as if she is going to reveal a big secret.   Very
          quiet and cute in her mannerisms.
          
                              JUDY
                    Yeah, it was after I saw you shoot
                    that gun.
          
                               JIMMY (O.C.)
                    You were crying. I wanted to kill
                    myself after I did that. You were
                    scared and you were shaking. It
                    was the most awful thing I ever
                    did. I didn't think I'd ever see
                    you again.
          
                                                                      34.
          
          
          
          Judy thinks.
          
                              JUDY
                    I was scared at first. Really
                    scared. I didn't expect it to be
                    so loud and you looked so mean.
                    But then I got home and started
                    thinking about it. About how your
                    muscles looked and how dangerous it
                    all seemed. It made me like... all
                    excited, and like...
          
          Judy looks for the right word.
          
                                JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Horny?
          
          Judy laughs with embarrassment.      Camera shakes as Jimmy hands
          it to her.
          
                                JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Here.    Hold this.
          
          Judy turns the camera back on Jimmy as he leaps out of bed.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Where you going?
          
                                JIMMY
                    One sec!
          
          Jimmy's bare ass flashes us as he heads out the bedroom door.
          
          Judy holds the camera as we hear Jimmy in the hallway. He
          opens a closet door, fumbles through it, then busts back into
          the bedroom, holding the shotgun he used out on the lake.
          
          Jimmy zooms in on Jimmy's naked upper body as he stands in
          front of her and begins pumping the gun and pulling the
          trigger. Obviously the gun is not loaded.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    That is so hot!
          
                              JIMMY
                    My dad keeps it in his closet.
                    Here.
          
          Jimmy gives Judy the gun.     Now she's holding the gun and the
          camera.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    It's heavy.
          
                                                                    35.
          
          
          
          Judy points the gun at Jimmy.   She lowers it, aiming right at
          his crotch just below frame.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Now I see the appeal.     Give me the
                    camera.
          
          Judy hands Jimmy the camera.    Camera moves and shakes as she
          hands it over.
          
          Jimmy frames her up nicely. Now we see Judy topless,
          pointing the gun directly at the lens of the camera.
          
                              JUDY
                    What do you think of this?
          
          She brings the gun down, then takes the barrel of the gun and
          places it between her breasts, squishing them together,
          covering her nipples as she rubs the barrel between her
          breasts.
          
                              JUDY
                    Do you like that?
          
                               JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Yes.
          
          Judy takes the barrel of the gun from her breasts and near
          her mouth. She starts rolling her tongue over the top of the
          barrel slowly and seductively, then stops. It looks as if
          she's about to perform full mock oral sex on the barrel of
          the gun.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    That is SO hot.
          
          As she is about to start to move her mouth and lips over the
          gun, then suddenly we hear a garage door open.
          
          Jimmy throws the camera sideways down on the bed.
          
                               JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Fuck!   It's my parents!
          
          We are now seeing sideways rotated images of Jimmy and Judy
          panicking, throwing on their clothes as fast as humanly
          possible.
          
          Jimmy grabs the camera off the bed and turns it off.
          
                                                            CAMERA ON:
          
                                                                    36.
          
          
          
          INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - PARENTS' BEDROOM - DAY
          
          Jimmy is hiding in the closet of his parents' bedroom. He
          has the door of the closet cracked and puts the lens of the
          camera through the crack.
          
          Jimmy's Dad enters the room. He has no idea that he is being
          filmed and that Jimmy is in the closet.
          
          Jimmy's Dad walks over to the dresser, opens up the top
          drawer and pulls something out. It's too dark in the room to
          tell exactly what he's pulled out, but it appears to resemble
          some sort of undergarment.
          
          Jimmy's Dad begins undressing, then steps out of frame.
          
          After a beat, he reappears. Now he's wearing nothing but a
          sequined teddy. He's totally fat, hairy, and nasty looking.
          He sits on the side of the bed, his back to us. Now we see
          that what he grabbed out of the drawer was actually a pair of
          fishnet stockings. He begins putting them on.
          
          When he is finished putting on his panty hose, he gets up off
          the bed and begins admiring his legs in a mirror. He begins
          to gently stroke the sides of his legs, relishing the feel of
          the hose over his hands and fingertips.
          
          He seems to be lip syncing the words to a song and begins to
          get all worked up. He shakes his hips and dances around the
          room for a few seconds.
          
          Now Jimmy's Dad goes to the dresser and pulls out a long
          brunette wig from the back of his top drawer. Putting it on,
          with the fishnet stockings, sequined teddy and long wig, he
          has transformed himself into the world's fattest, ugliest,
          hairiest, Cher look-a-like.
          
          Someone else enters the room.
          
                                 JIMMY'S DAD
                    Hi sweety.
          
          Holy shit. It's Jimmy's Mom, and she's wearing a leather
          dominatrix outfit!
          
                              JIMMY'S MOM
                    Are you ready for me, you fucking
                    slut?
          
                                 JIMMY'S DAD
                    Not quite.
          
                                                                  37.
          
          
          
                              JIMMY'S MOM
                    I don't feel like waiting. Hurry
                    up bitch. What do you have left to
                    do?
          
                              JIMMY'S DAD
                    I just need to put on my makeup.
          
          As Jimmy's Mom exits frame, we see Jimmy's Dad go to the
          mirror. He opens up the top drawer again and pulls out a
          little makeup bag.
          
          Jimmy's Mom re-enters, now wearing a mini leather biker's
          hat, carrying a riding switch.
          
                              JIMMY'S MOM
                    Come on slut.
          
          Jimmy's Dad finishes applying his lipstick and moves over to
          the bed. By the way Jimmy's parents are behaving, it's as if
          they've gone through this routine a thousand times.
          
          Jimmy's Mom drifts off screen as Jimmy's Dad gets up on all
          fours. Suddenly, we hear a SMACK as Jimmy's Mom hits Jimmy's
          Dad on his ass with the switch.
          
          He lets out deep pleasured groans as she continues SMACKING
          him with the whip harder and harder. He yelps, squeals, and
          gyrates his hips back and forth, then starts dry humping the
          air until she stops.
          
          Jimmy's Mom comes back through and out of frame. Jimmy's Dad
          pushes his belly into the bed, groaning from the pain while
          he waits for her return.
          
          She comes back, moving quickly across the screen wearing an
          enormous strap on dildo.
          
          Disappearing out of frame again, Jimmy's Dad gets himself
          ready for her one more time, ass up, on all fours on the bed.
          
          From behind, we can see her hand as she hikes her husband's
          dress up his back, then we see his face and hear him grunt as
          she rips his fishnets off screen.
          
          There's a pause. Nothing seems to be happening, but Jimmy's
          Dad is bracing himself for something. His face tightens up.
          Off screen, Jimmy's Mom has started mounting him from behind.
          
          Jimmy can't take it any longer. As he slowly emerges from
          the closet, his Mom notices Jimmy almost immediately. She
          jumps off her husband, screaming bloody murder.
          
                                                                  38.
          
          
          
          Camera's shaky but it's easy to guess what's been happening.
          Mom's just started doing Dad from behind with the strap on.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Hi mom.     Hi dad.   What are you guys
                    up to?
          
          Jimmy's Dad leaps from the bed and begins shouting. He looks
          completely absurd screaming at Jimmy wearing his sequined
          dress and wig.
          
                              JIMMY'S DAD
                    What the fuck are you doing here?
          
          Jimmy's Mom goes hysterical and begins screaming at Jimmy's
          Dad.
          
                              JIMMY'S MOM
                        (to his dad)
                    I told you he would find out you
                    fucking freak! No wonder he's a
                    fucking psycho. Look a his father.
          
          Jimmy's Dad is beside himself with fury and throws off his
          wig.
          
                              JIMMY'S DAD
                    Turn off the that fucking camera!
                    Turn off that fucking camera right
                    fucking now god damn it!
          
          Jimmy is loving it.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Gee dad, what do you say the two of
                    us go out to the front yard and
                    throw some ball together? We'll
                    have a nice friendly game of catch.
          
          Jimmy's Dad attacks Jimmy. He swings at the lens. He's one
          angry drag queen daddy. He begins strangling Jimmy.
          
                              JIMMY'S DAD
                    You little mother fucker.     Turn off
                    that fucking camera!
          
          Jimmy's Mom rips off her strap on dildo and begins beating
          Jimmy's Dad with it.
          
          Judging from the punishment she's inflicting upon her drag
          queen husband, the dildo apparently is made from the finest
          and heaviest of materials.
          
                                                                     39.
          
          
          
                                 JIMMY'S MOM
                    Stop it!     You're going to kill him.
          
          Jimmy's Dad lets go.    The dildo's doing the trick.
          
                                 JIMMY'S DAD
                    Bitch!
          
          Jimmy's Mom keeps swinging the dildo at Jimmy's Dad even
          though he's let go.
          
                              JIMMY'S MOM
                    Fuck you! You think you know me?
                    You don't know me! You piece of
                    shit!
          
                                 JIMMY
                           (laughing)
                    Mom!
          
          Jimmy's Mom now directs her attention on Jimmy. She screams
          at him as she swings her gigantic strap on towards the
          camera.
          
                              JIMMY'S MOM
                    You little beast! You want to film
                    something? Film this!
          
          She continues to swing the strap on as she walks closer and
          closer to the lens.
          
          The camera goes crazy. Loud sounds are heard throughout the
          room. Evidently Jimmy has been tackled. We hear wrestling
          and grunting. It seems that Jimmy's Dad has tackled Jimmy,
          or maybe his Mom, or both, but the camera is too shaky to
          tell just what has happened.
          
          Jimmy's Dad is still fighting. He seems to have them all
          pinned against the floor. He's crushing his mother.
          
                              JIMMY'S DAD (O.C.)
                    Nancy, Nancy, Nancy, Nancy! Please
                    someone call me Nancy. My name is
                    Nancy.
          
                              JIMMY'S MOM (O.C.)
                        (crying hysterically)
                    Nancy, Nancy, Nancy... Jimmy
                    please call him "Nancy" for the
                    love of God. Call your daddy
                    Nancy. Call him Nancy...!
          
                                                                     40.
          
          
          
          We hear Jimmy's Mom screaming/repeating herself. We see a
          hand go over the lens. Jimmy and his mother and father are
          all in a wrestling match on the floor.
          
          Jimmy with great enthusiasm begins to sing as the camera
          shakes.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Take me out to the ball game, take
                    me out to the crowd, buy me some
                    peanuts and crackerjacks...
          
          The wrestling match continues as we see more hands come
          towards the lens. Jimmy's Mom suddenly stops screaming, as
          if she's been knocked out.
          
                              JIMMY'S DAD (O.C.)
                    Give me that fucking tape!
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    I don't think so Nancy.   Nancy,
                    Nancy, Nancy...
          
          After some very intense fighting, someone is finally able to
          shut the camera off.
          
                                                         CAMERA ON:
          
          EXT. FOREST/MEADOW - RUNNING NAKED - DAY
          
          Jimmy has the camera and is chasing a naked (just from
          behind) Judy through the woods. The camera shakes and
          rattles, but we can definitely tell this is all in good fun.
          
          Judy screams as she is being chased through the woods.   She
          couldn't feel more free.
          
          She begins to tire and slows down. She can no longer run and
          turns towards the camera. As she turns around, camera shows
          her from the waist up. She has a beer can in her hand and
          she is a little drunk.
          
          For the first time, she's completely at ease with her own
          body and looks perfectly natural being naked in the
          wilderness. She walks towards the camera smoothly and
          seductively. Her long hair blond hair blows gently in the
          wind.
          
                              JUDY
                    I'm so glad you're out. Next time
                    your dad wants to take it in the
                    ass, DON'T FILM HIM!
          
                                                                     41.
          
          
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    I know. Ironic that I was the one
                    sent to the nut house.
          
                              JUDY
                    I thought I was going to die
                    without you. What if you and I
                    could live here together? Forever.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Right here?
          
                              JUDY
                    I'm serious. Maybe not here, but
                    eventually we'll buy some land, and
                    we can live together on it, and be
                    naked whenever we want.
          
          She takes a big swig of her beer.    Then burps.
          
                                 JUDY
                    Excuse me.     What do you think?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    I think you're drunk.
          
          Judy walks towards the camera.    She puts her mouth inches
          away from the lens.
          
                              JUDY
                    I think you're right mister.
          
          Judy giggles, then dances around playfully in the woods.      She
          has never felt so alive.
          
                              JUDY
                    I don't want this to ever end. I
                    want to be here forever. I want to
                    dance and be naked and be free, and
                    I want us to ball our brains out
                    everyday, and I want to feel the
                    air on my body and I want to get
                    drunk and not care about anything
                    in the world. I just want us to be
                    together in this moment.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    I know a place like that.
          
                                 JUDY
                    You do?
          
                                                                     42.
          
          
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Yep. We can go there one day if
                    you want.
          
                                JUDY
                    We can?    Where is it?
          
                                JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Erlanger.
          
                              JUDY
                        (doesn't buy it)
                    Erlanger!
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Yeah Erlanger. Everybody was
                    talking about it in the nut house.
                    That's ALL anybody fucking talked
                    about was this dude who lives up
                    there named Uncle Rodney. He
                    supposedly has a commune where we
                    can do this kind of thing every
                    day.
          
                              JUDY
                    Uncle Rodney's commune?
          
          Judy smiles, almost laughing. It all sounds pretty
          ridiculous to her, but plays along anyway.
          
                              JUDY
                    That's funny.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                        (playfully)
                    No, I'm serious.
          
          Judy walks back towards the camera and grabs it away from
          Jimmy, surprising him.
          
                                JIMMY
                    Hey!
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Okay, now it's your turn.
          
          Shot from the waist up, we now see that Jimmy's naked as
          well. He's at a loss as to what he should say.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    How does it feel to be a free man?
          
          Jimmy thinks.    A drunk Judy is losing her patience.
          
                                                                   43.
          
          
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Come on, come on, come on...
          
                              JIMMY
                    I'm thinking.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Just let it go, be free.
          
                              JIMMY
                        (adoringly)
                    You're such a hippie all of sudden.
          
                                JUDY (O.C.)
                    Come on.
          
                                JIMMY
                    No.
          
          Judy's not getting what she wants from him.   Camera shuts
          down.
          
                                                          CAMERA ON:
          
          EXT. FOREST/MEADOW - RUNNING NAKED - DAY
          
          Judy films Jimmy. The camera is close and intimate as they
          lie on their sides staring into each other's eyes. Judy is
          still naked, but is being shot in an extreme close up.
          
                                JUDY (O.C.)
                    Okay, go.
          
          Jimmy's still not up for it.   Judy grabs the camera and turns
          it on him.
          
                                JUDY (O.C.)
                    Come on!
          
          Jimmy's turns the tables.
          
                               JIMMY
                    Okay, you really wanna hear
                    something?
          
                                JUDY (O.C.)
                    Yeah.
          
          Jimmy takes a deep breath, a touch of intensity flashes in
          his eye, then...
          
                                                          44.
          
          
          
                              JIMMY
                    I want to go one day without
                    masturbating. I want to liberate
                    my penis. I want to clone you so
                    we could have a three way and
                    neither of us would be cheating. I
                    want you to scrape my balls with a
                    cheese grater...
          
          Judy starts laughing.   The camera's shaking.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    That's gross!
          
          Jimmy suddenly gets serious.
          
                              JIMMY
                    And I love you. I love you so much
                    it hurts.
          
                                JUDY (O.C.)
                    It hurts?
          
                              JIMMY
                    Like God is stabbing me in heart
                    with a thousand knives at the same
                    time and you're the only one who
                    can make the pain go away. Do you
                    love me that much?
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    I love you so much, I'd rather die
                    than be without you.
          
                                JIMMY
                    Here.
          
          Jimmy grabs the camera and points it at Judy.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Make me a promise... the way a
                    husband and wife make a promise...
                    that we will be together always and
                    forever.
          
                              JUDY
                    You mean get married?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Something more powerful than
                    marriage. It's a bond. It's our
                    bond. It's transcendental.
          
                                                                  45.
          
          
          
                              JUDY
                    What?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Transcendental.
                        (grabs the camera)
                    Here.
          
          Jimmy hands Judy the camera as she starts to frame him up,
          but they're really engaging each other's eyes over the top of
          the eyepiece.
          
                              JIMMY
                    It's transcendental because it
                    transcends everything. Life, love,
                    law, people, things... A bond so
                    strong that our souls will become
                    one and it can never end, even in
                    death. If you swear on the bond,
                    it means you'd rather die than
                    break your promise.
          
          Judy is moved.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    That's so beautiful.
          
                              JIMMY
                    You're so beautiful.    I want to
                    love you forever.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Swear on the bond. Swear we'll be
                    together forever, that you'd rather
                    die than be apart.
          
                              JIMMY
                    I swear on the bond.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    And we'll never let anything come
                    between us, not even death.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Not even death. I swear. Nothing
                    will come between us, ever.
          
          Jimmy stares at her, then slowly leans in for a kiss... a
          long, wet, toe curling kiss. Jimmy finds a way to point the
          camera at the kiss.
          
                                                                  46.
          
          
          
          They break apart. Judy sighs, staring into Jimmy's eyes,
          then leans into him, his lips touching her forehead, their
          eyes closing as they feel the energy of true love.
          
                              JUDY
                    We'll be together forever.
          
                              JIMMY
                        (whispers)
                    Together forever.
          
          Camera shuts down.
          
                                                          CAMERA ON:
          
          I/E. GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT/JIMMY'S CAR - DAY
          
          Jimmy and Judy sit in a parked car outside of a huge grocery
          store.
          
          Jimmy and Judy sit outside a small grocery store. Jimmy
          films himself. Judy's in the passenger seat. He does his
          best news announcer impersonation.
          
                              JIMMY
                    This is action ten news reporter
                    Jimmy Van Muffmuncher reporting to
                    you live from the parking lot of
                    Dick's grocery store where we're
                    going to witness the beautiful, the
                    talented, the amazing Judy, commit
                    her first crime.
          
          Jimmy flips the camera around onto Judy.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Is there anything you would like to
                    say to the public and your adoring
                    fans before you go through with
                    this?
          
          Judy gleefully plays along.
          
                              JUDY
                    Well Mr. Van Muffmuncher. I just
                    want to say that I look forward to
                    losing, my, um...
          
          Judy pauses to think.
          
                              JUDY
                    What did you call it before?
          
                                                                    47.
          
          
          
                               JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Your conformist crimeless
                    virginity.
          
          Judy snaps back into her role as interviewee.
          
                              JUDY
                    Yes, I am very much looking forward
                    to losing my conformist crimeless
                    virginity. I would also like to
                    share with my fans these.
          
          Judy lifts up her shirt and exposes her bra to the camera.
          
                              JIMMY (V.O.)
                        (in his reporter voice)
                    Thank you and thank your tits for
                    this rare, behind the scenes look
                    at your first crime slash moment of
                    truth.
          
          Judy leans in pops a quick kiss at the lens of the camera.
          Jimmy shuts it down.
          
                                                          CAMERA ON:
          
          INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY
          
          Jimmy is in a grocery store aisle filming Judy from way far
          away. We can barely make out that it is her until Jimmy
          zooms in tighter. She couldn't look more nervous or obvious.
          
          She is in the beer section. She quickly takes a six pack of
          canned beer and struggles to put it in her school bag. She
          walks quickly towards the exit. Jimmy follows her and
          catches up.
          
          Jimmy is standing next to her and he continues to film.   Judy
          looks so nervous.
          
                              JUDY
                    Jimmy, turn it off.    We're gonna
                    get busted.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    No way, this is the best part.
          
          A man is yelling at them off camera.
          
                              MAN (O.C.)
                    Hey you two. Stop.
          
                                                                    48.
          
          
          
          Jimmy pans over and a store manager is standing in front of
          them.
          
                              STORE MANAGER
                    What the hell do you think you're
                    doing?
          
          Jimmy and Judy have no reply.   The store manager gives them
          his best intimidating stare.
          
          There is an extremely long pause.
          
                              STORE MANAGER
                    Turn that damn thing off. You
                    can't be running around the store
                    playing with a camera. It's
                    against the store policy. Now get
                    out of here.
          
          Camera shuts down.
          
                                                           CAMERA ON:
          
          EXT. GROCERY STORE - PARKING LOT - DAY
          
          Judy is looking at the lens of the camera.    She's shaking and
          screaming.
          
                              JUDY
                    What is the matter with you Jimmy?
                    You almost got us caught. You're
                    so worried about that camera. What
                    is it? What is it!
          
          Jimmy calmly and quietly explains.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Twenty years from now, when we're
                    together watching these tapes
                    you'll realize how special this
                    moment is. I owe it to you. And I
                    owe it to us to capture everything
                    and anything we do together.
          
          Judy is calmed but still is pissed.
          
                               JUDY
                    Well you freak me out sometimes.
                    Why do you have to tape everything?
                    It's like you have a problem or
                    something.
          
          Judy's case isn't sticking.   She treads lightly.
          
                                                                   49.
          
          
          
                              JUDY
                    You know, most of the reason kids
                    think you're so weird is because of
                    it. Why do you think everybody
                    makes fun of you? And then I have
                    to hear it and I have to deal with
                    it.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    So everybody makes fun of me, huh?
          
                              JUDY
                    Yeah. Can't you give the thing a
                    fucking rest?
          
          Jimmy's fuming.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    And you don't want to deal with it?
                    Well fuck them and fuck you too if
                    you think that. I couldn't give a
                    fuck what people say. This is my
                    life and I want to document it.
                    And right now me filming you
                    happens to be the only reason I
                    manage to get out of my fucking bed
                    every morning! You can't take this
                    away from me!
          
          Jimmy starts crying.
          
          Judy takes the camera. She tapes Jimmy who is sobbing. Now
          she is the one who speaks gently. She's trying to give him a
          taste of his own medicine.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    How does it feel Jimmy? How does
                    it feel to have someone taping you
                    while you're crying?
          
          Jimmy doesn't answer.   He tries to compose himself enough to
          speak.
          
          Judy pushes harder.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Tell me. Look at the camera and
                    tell me how it feels!
          
                              JIMMY
                    You're not getting it. It doesn't
                    matter how it feels right now.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                       50.
          
                              JIMMY (cont'd)
                    What matters is that you're seeing
                    what's inside of me and your taping
                    it. Can you understand that?
          
          Judy doesn't know how to respond.
          
                                JIMMY
                    Can you?
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    I don't know.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Well can you at least try?
          
          Jimmy is still crying.   This weighs on her.
          
                                JUDY (O.C.)
                    Yes.    I can most definitely try.
          
                              JIMMY
                    And you can never, ever, ever ask
                    me to not film you or anything we
                    do. That's the only thing I'll
                    ever ask of you. Agreed?
          
                               JUDY (O.C.)
                    Okay.   I'm sorry.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Will you swear to it?     On camera,
                    will you swear to it?
          
          Jimmy has talked himself into a good mood.       Before we hear
          Judy's response, we...
          
                                                            JUMP CUT TO:
          
          I/E. GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT/JIMMY'S CAR - DAY
          
          Moments later, Jimmy is now taping Judy. She has her right
          hand up, like a witness about to be sworn into the stand.
          She's all smiles as Jimmy gives her the oath to repeat back
          to him.
          
                              JAMES (O.C.)
                    Please raise your right hand.
          
          Judy raises her right hand.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Please repeat after me.    I Judy...
          
                                                                    51.
          
          
          
                                JUDY
                    I Judy...
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Do hereby solemnly swear...
          
                              JUDY
                    Do hereby solemnly swear...
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    That I will never ask, request, or
                    even insinuate to Jimmy to cease
                    filming, no matter the situation.
          
                              JUDY
                    That I will never ask, request, or
                    even insinuate to Jimmy to cease
                    filming, no matter the situation.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    And furthermore, I do hereby
                    solemnly swear to commit myself to
                    giving Jimmy his daily blowjob and
                    will continue to perform various
                    sex acts with the skill and
                    enthusiasm that he has become
                    accustomed to.
          
          Judy laughs, then screams with embarrassed excitement.    Her
          laughter and happiness is infectious.
          
          She pounds her fists on the dashboard and laughs again.
          
          We can hear Jimmy laughing off camera as well.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Keep your right hand up.
          
          Judy lifts her right hand back up.   She looks at the camera
          with a huge smile.
          
                              JUDY
                    I do hereby solemnly swear to g...
          
          THWACK! Someone has thrown a full soda can on the hood of
          Jimmy's car. He pans and zooms the camera over and sees a
          car full of Three Teenagers laughing at them.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Mother fuckers.
          
          Suddenly the TEENAGE DRIVER of the car appears, as if out of
          nowhere, running to the passenger side. Jimmy zooms out.
          
                                                                   52.
          
          
          The frame catches up to him just as he spits a huge LOOGIE
          into the car, hitting Judy right in the face.
          
          Judy screams. The car full of Three Teenagers laugh
          hysterically at her expense.
          
          Jimmy hands Judy the camera.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Here, you're definitely going to
                    want to tape this.
          
          Jimmy calmly gets out of his car as Judy tapes him through
          the window. We can hear her breathing heavily as she tries
          not to cry softly off camera.
          
          Jimmy has gone to the rear of the car. We hear the trunk
          open while Judy films through the windshield at the car full
          of laughing teens. Jimmy enters the frame carrying a
          baseball bat.
          
          We see him talking calmly to the driver of the car, the Kid
          who spat in Judy's face. Then...
          
          WHAM!
          
          Jimmy reels back and clocks the kid right in the face with
          the bat. The Kid falls over into the front seat of the car.
          
          Jimmy calmly walks over to the front of the car and begins
          bashing in the windshield.
          
                               JUDY (O.C.)
                        (to herself)
                    Oh my God.
          
          Now rage has taken over Jimmy over entirely.   He's bashing in
          the windshield with all of his might.
          
          The teenagers all go running from the car.   A crowd starts to
          form in the parking lot.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                        (to herself)
                    Oh, God Jimmy...
          
          Jimmy has now completely bashed in the windshield and moves
          to the front of the car. He now begins smashing the other
          windows.
          
          Now a sizeable crowd is formed. Jimmy is seemingly oblivious
          to them and continues bashing the car.
          
                                                                  53.
          
          
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                        (to herself)
                    I love you Jimmy.
          
          Now it's to the point of overkill. But Jimmy won't stop.
          It's as if the rage he's been carrying inside of him his
          entire life is now coming to the surface.
          
          We hear sirens in the distance as Jimmy continues to bash the
          car. The car is in near shambles as we hear police sirens in
          the distance.
          
          Judy begins screaming.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Jimmy stop, please stop. Jimmy...
                    oh god, Jimmy stop. God damn it,
                    fucking stop!
          
          Jimmy doesn't. He pounds the car harder as a police cruiser
          pulls up. Two policemen get out of the car. They are
          temporarily paralyzed with indecision.
          
          We see one of the officers trying to speak with Jimmy. He
          just ignores them. The policemen are oblivious to the fact
          they are being filmed.
          
          One of the officers gets out a can of mace and sprays it in
          Jimmy's face.
          
          Now Jimmy is completely freaking out. We hear him scream,
          but he continues to bash the car with his eyes closed. One
          of the cops draws his gun as Jimmy swings aimlessly towards
          them. He gets sprayed again with the mace and is now
          completely blinded. A huge crowd has now amassed outside of
          the grocery store.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Oh, God Jimmy, oh God...
          
          Now the entire parking lot is filled with cop cars. Lights
          are flashing all around Jimmy. He is surrounded but sill
          continues to swing the bat.
          
                               JUDY (O.C.)
                    Jimmy...
          
          Three cops tackle Jimmy from behind. Judy throws down the
          camera and runs out the door. The camera is face down on the
          seat.
          
                                                                   54.
          
          
          
          We hear Judy get out of the car, leaving the door open so we
          can hear the entire scene with much more intensity. The
          sounds of police sirens and radios is overwhelming.
          
          We hear a woman screaming and more sirens and cars are
          pulling up. More screaming and sounds on the radio is heard.
          We hear police chatter:
          
                              POLICE CHATTER (O.C.)
                        (over the police radios)
                    We're going to need an ambulance
                    stat at the parking lot of the
                    grocery store on Route 18...
          
          More screaming and chatter is heard until someone enters the
          car. We don't know who it is. They turn off the camera.
          
                                                          CAMERA ON:
          
          I/E. SANITARIUM PARKING LOT/JUDY'S CAR - DAY
          
          Judy is filming. She sits behind the wheel pointing the
          camera at the front door of a HIDDEN VALLEY Mental Hospital.
          She zooms in on a sign.
          
          Judy flips the camera around to herself.
          
                               JUDY
                    Hi baby. I miss you.
                         (blowing a kiss)
                    Mwaa! I'll be waiting for you when
                    you get out. Be good and don't
                    wait too long. Look what I did for
                    you!
          
          Judy opens her mouth wide.   She's got a tongue stud on her
          tongue.
          
                              JUDY
                    I can't wait to use it on you!
          
          Camera shuts down.
          
                                                          CAMERA ON:
          
          I/E. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT DRIVE THRU/JIMMY'S CAR - DAY
          
          Jimmy's pulled forward to the drive thru while Judy tapes
          from passenger seat. A voice squawks at Jimmy, asking for
          his order.
          
                                                                  55.
          
          
          
                              JIMMY
                    Can I get a double cheese burger,
                    no pickles, large fries and a coke?
          
          Jimmy looks at the camera.
          
                              JIMMY
                    That's what I fucking missed more
                    than anything. Fast food.
          
          He turns back to order more.
          
                              JIMMY
                    And a number two.
          
          The Drive Thru window voice rattles off a price and tells him
          to pull up. Jimmy continues to camera.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    What did you do in there all day?
          
                              JIMMY
                    Masturbated mostly.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                        (jokingly)
                    You cheated on me! I want to be
                    the only person responsible for
                    making you cum.
          
                              JIMMY
                    I hope you're willing to be on call
                    twenty four hours a day.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Seriously, what did you do? What
                    was a day in the life of Jimmy in
                    the nut house?
          
                              JIMMY
                    Well, besides masturbating, I
                    talked and talked and talked and
                    fucking talked until they were
                    satisfied. But basically I told
                    them what they wanted to hear. I
                    said shit like...
          
          Jimmy does an over the top mock sincerity speech.
          
                                                                      56.
          
          
          
                              JIMMY
                    "Now that I'm finally able to talk
                    about my problems, I now realize
                    that my behavior was inappropriate
                    and harmful to others."
          
          Judy laughs.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Then I figured it out. I had to
                    cry as much as possible. Whenever
                    someone would cry they'd call it a
                    "break through." So I'd be like.
          
          Jimmy does an imitation of himself in therapy.   He looks
          directly into the lens.
          
                              JIMMY
                    You start out slow, then you build
                    it up like this... "Now I know
                    that using violence is not the
                    answer."
          
          Jimmy is getting progressively sappier and more over the top
          with his self impersonation.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Then you go like this:
                        (snaps back into the
                         impersonation)
                    I was wrong, I know I was wrong and
                    I'll never do it again. I don't
                    want to hurt people or myself.
          
          Jimmy does an obnoxious fake cry.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Boo hoo, waaaaaa, boo-hoo-hoo,
                    waaaaaaa.
                        (snaps out of it)
                    Then you always give them the
                    obligatory hug at the end. After a
                    couple of weeks, then they
                    officially diagnose you with
                    something, give you a prescription,
                    then you're done.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    God, you're a genius.
          
          Jimmy pulls up to the drive through window and pays the
          Cashier who hands him the a paper bag of food.
          
                                                                  57.
          
          
          
          Jimmy pulls away and parks. Judy continues to question him
          as he goes through his bag of food.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    So what did they say you have?
          
          Jimmy munches on some fries.
          
                              JIMMY
                    ODD. Oppositional Defiance
                    Disorder.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    You're so lucky. I wish I was
                    diagnosed with something. What
                    does it mean?
          
          Jimmy pretends he is reading from a text book 50's industrial
          spoof style.
          
                              JIMMY
                    ODD is a disorder characterized by
                    an overwhelming pattern of
                    negative, hostile, and defiant
                    behavior which causes severe
                    delusions where the patient can no
                    longer distinguish fantasy from
                    reality.
          
                               JUDY (O.C.)
                    Wow.   I love that!
          
          Jimmy smiles as he gets his burger out of the paper bag. He
          then opens the top bun of the burger to examine if they got
          his order correct. They didn't.
          
          Jimmy playfully begins to act crazy.
          
                              JIMMY
                    You see. They fucked up my order.
                    I specifically asked for no
                    pickles.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                        (playing along)
                    Oh, no! How will ODD Boy handle
                    this? Will his ODD brain be able
                    to withstand a pickle screw up at
                    the drive thru?
          
          Jimmy goes into a cartoonish like crazy person character.
          
                                                                  58.
          
          
          
          He begins by taking the pickles off of his burger. He puts
          the burger down, quickly lifts his shirt, holding it up with
          his chin while he places two pickles over top of his nipples.
          
          Jimmy yells.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Ooow, jeez, they're hot! I burnt
                    my nipples with the pickles.
          
          Judy cracks up laughing. Jimmy takes a pickle off of his
          left nipple and dangles it directly in front of the lens.
          
          He then feeds it to Judy. We hear Judy chomping on the
          pickle and giggling off camera. The camera shakes then shuts
          down.
          
                                                         CAMERA ON:
          
          I/E. GHETTO/JUDY'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          Judy is driving through the ghetto as Jimmy shoots out of the
          window. On the sidewalk, he catches glimpses Drug Dealers, a
          Crack Whore, a Drunk stumbling along, and Other Pretty
          Sketchy Characters.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    I love the ghetto. I don't know
                    what it is about it. I fucking
                    love it. It's always the first
                    place I go to when I get out.
          
                              JUDY
                    I love it when you're out of the
                    looney bin. Do you think you might
                    be able to try to avoid the place
                    for a while?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                        (joking)
                    If they don't send me to the bin,
                    maybe they'll send me to jail.
          
          This upsets Judy.
          
                              JUDY
                    I'm serious. You act like it's no
                    big deal when you go away!
          
                               JIMMY (O.C.)
                        (tired of it)
                    All right.
          
                                                                      59.
          
          
          
                              JUDY
                    No it's not all right! When you're
                    in there I have to be out in the
                    real world alone, by myself Jimmy.
                    You go away and come back like it's
                    no big deal. Well it is a big
                    deal. I don't want to spend
                    another day without you. Do you
                    understand me? I'd rather die.
          
          Judy's holding back tears.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    I'm not going back.
          
          She doesn't believe him. She's really starting to cry
          despite herself. He pulls his eye from the lens to look at
          her.
          
                               JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Judy.
          
          Judy looks over at him.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    I promise. I swear on my life and
                    I swear on our bond, I'll never go
                    back.
          
          Her freak out subsides.
          
                              JUDY
                    If you swear on our bond, then I
                    believe you.
          
          Judy lets out half cry and half yelp.   Her emotions are a bit
          out of control.
          
                              JUDY
                    I love you so fucking much.
          
                              JIMMY    (O.C.)
                    I love you too.
          
          Awkward silence.   Judy looks like she wants to ask Jimmy
          something.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    What's the matter?
          
                                                                     60.
          
          
          
                              JUDY
                    I was thinking, the last time you
                    got out we did it like five times,
                    like as soon as we saw each other,
                    we got naked and started doing it.
                    And today, my parents weren't even
                    home and I tried to do some stuff
                    to you, but you were acting like
                    you weren't interested.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    I didn't mean to.
          
                              JUDY
                    Was it because you jerked off so
                    much while you were locked up?
          
          Jimmy hands her a small bottle of whiskey. She takes a
          sizable gulp, makes a face, then hands it back to Jimmy.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    No.
          
          Judy is getting upset again.
          
                              JUDY
                        (voice cracking)
                    Then why don't you want to have sex
                    with me Jimmy? You don't think I'm
                    pretty anymore?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    No, no, no! That has nothing to do
                    with it. After I saw my dad being
                    rammed in the ass by my mother, I
                    kind of blocked it out, but when I
                    was in there they kept talking to
                    me and talking to me about it. Now
                    I can't stop it from coming into my
                    head. Every time I get wood, the
                    instant replay machine in my brain
                    projects this image of my Mom
                    pounding into my Dad.
          
                              JUDY
                    God, that's awful.   I didn't know.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Yeah well, you know you didn't give
                    too much of an effort to get in my
                    pants anyhow. You just sort of
                    made your sex face and grabbed my
                    crotch.
          
                                                                    61.
          
          
          
          Judy takes another drink off the bottle of whiskey and
          smiles.
          
                              JUDY
                    How do you like this?
          
          While she is driving she pulls down her tank top and quickly
          exposes her breasts through the top of her shirt.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Now we're talking.
          
          Judy tries to position her body so her breasts are in frame.
          She begins pushing one up, then sticks out her tongue,
          teasing.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    That is so hot.
          
          Judy smiles and looks over at the camera. One hand on the
          steering wheel and one on her breast, when...
          
                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Watch out!
          
          BOOM!
          
          A loud THUMP hits the car, shaking the camera.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    I think you hit someone.
          
          Judy's in shock. Jimmy puts the camera on the floor of the
          car by the passenger seat. He forgets to turn it off.
          
          All we see is a close up of the floor and Jimmy's feet.
          
                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Stay here.
          
          Jimmy gets out of the car.    We hear the car door open then
          close.
          
          Judy sounds like she is having a complete nervous breakdown.
          She's crying, but in an extremely nervous and frantic way.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                        (calls to him)
                    Oh my God, what are you doing?
          
          We have no clue what Jimmy is doing outside of the car.
          
                                                                  62.
          
          
          
                               JUDY (O.C.)
                     Oh fuck, oh fuck. Oh my god.
                     Jimmy?
          
          We hear a car door open and some struggling sounds coming
          from Jimmy.
          
                               JUDY (O.C.)
                     Don't put him in here!
          
                               JIMMY (O.C.)
                     We're taking him to the hospital.
          
                               JUDY (O.C.)
                     No, we'll get busted.
          
          Long pause, we hear Jimmy struggling off camera.
          
                               JUDY (O.C.)
                     What... what are you doing?
          
                               JIMMY (O.C.)
                     He's not breathing. He's not
                     fucking breathing!
          
          Silence.   You can feel them thinking.
          
                               JUDY (O.C.)
                     Is he dead?
          
                               JIMMY (O.C.)
                         (has decided)
                     Pop the trunk for me.
          
                               JUDY (O.C.)
                     No.
          
                               JIMMY (O.C.)
                     Judy.
          
                               JUDY (O.C.)
                     What are we gonna do?
          
                               JIMMY (O.C.)
                     I don't know right now, but we're
                     not driving around with a dead guy
                     in our back seat.
          
                               JUDY (O.C.)
                     I just want to go home. Jimmy,
                     let's leave him. He's dead. We
                     should just go.
          
                                                                  63.
          
          
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Pop the fucking trunk already
                    before someone sees us!
          
          We hear Judy pop the trunk.
          
          We hear Jimmy struggling.
          
          The camera is still on the floor of the car.
          
          More struggling as Jimmy is clearly outside putting the body
          into the trunk.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                        (to self)
                    I want to go home.
          
          We hear Jimmy slam the trunk.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                        (screams; frustrated)
                    Fuck!
          
          We hear Jimmy come around to the driver's seat and open the
          door.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Jimmy, I...
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    I'm driving.
          
          We hear Judy get out of the car and walk around to the
          passenger side and open the door, but she doesn't get in.
          
                                JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Get in.
          
          Judy doesn't respond.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Are you gonna fucking get in!
          
          Judy is hysterical.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    We should just leave him here.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    We can't leave him in the middle of
                    the fucking ghetto. Get in before
                    someone sees us!
          
                                                                    64.
          
          
          
          Judy's losing it.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    I don't want him in my fucking car!
                    I want him out!
          
          Before Jimmy can respond, we see the reflection of police
          lights. Red and blue lights flicker against the lens.
          
                               JUDY (O.C.)
                    Oh shit!
          
          We hear Judy get in the car and close the door.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    It's the fucking cops.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Just shut up.
          
          She's hysterical.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    It's the cops. It's the cops.
                    It's the...
          
                               JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Shhhhhh!
          
          Jimmy kicks the camera. We still can't see any of this.     We
          can only hear what's happening.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    You gotta play it cool, okay?
          
          Judy's crying gets louder.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Stop fucking crying. Please, I'm
                    begging you. Stop it.
          
          We hear the cop open and shut his patrol car door.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Oh God. He's getting out of the
                    car. We've got a dead homeless guy
                    in our trunk and he's...
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    SSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
          
                                                                     65.
          
          
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Oh, my god Jimmy, he's walking
                    towards us.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    SSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Just be cool.
          
          The Cop is close, we can feel his footsteps coming towards
          the car. Judy collects herself as best as she can.
          
          The cop taps his flashlight against the window.
          
          We hear Judy roll down her power window and we hear the voice
          of the Cop.
          
                              COP (O.C.)
                    Good evening. License and
                    registration please.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Certainly, sir.
          
          The light from the Cop's flashlight reflects off the floor of
          the car and into the lens of the camera.
          
          The reflections stop.   The wait is unbearable.
          
                              COP (O.C.)
                    Could you please step out of the
                    vehicle?
          
          Jimmy gets out of the car as Judy trembles in the passengers
          seat.
          
          We only hear the sounds of Judy sniffling and repressing
          herself from crying and idle chatter of the Cop's radio.
          
          It seems like forever, then...
          
          THUMP!
          
          The car is shaking, we hear intense struggling going on
          outside.
          
          Judy unleashes a piercing, high pitched scream.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Jimmy!
          
          More violent struggling is heard as Judy begins to
          hyperventilate.
          
          POP
          
                                                                     66.
          
          
          
          A gunshot is fired.
          
          Judy screams.
          
                               JUDY (O.C.)
                     AAAAAHHHHHHH!
          
          POP.   Another shot is fired.
          
          The car door opens, Jimmy gets in. We hear the sounds of
          tires squealing and the engine roaring.
          
                               JUDY (O.C.)
                     What happened?
          
                                JIMMY (O.C.)
                     Shut up!
          
          Judy's now totally freaked.
          
                               JUDY (O.C.)
                     What happened!
          
                               JIMMY (O.C.)
                     Just shut the fuck up! I don't
                     fucking want to talk about it!
          
          Jimmy can't bully her into silence.    She continues to freak
          out. The camera is kicked.
          
                               JUDY (O.C.)
                     I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT FUCKING
                     HAPPENED! I WANNA KNOW. I WANNA
                     KNOW. I JUST WANNA FUCKING...!
          
          Camera is kicked off and shuts down.
          
                                                           CAMERA ON:
          
          EXT. REST STOP - SECLUDED AREA - TRUNK OF THE CAR - NIGHT
          
          A weird, digital, black and white image plays on the camera.
          There's no light and Jimmy's got the camera back in "Nite
          Shot" mode. He's standing outside of the car filming the
          Homeless Man who is lying dead inside of the trunk. Judy
          stands next to him as he films.
          
          The Homeless Man is twisted and contorted in order to fit in
          the small confines of the trunk.
          
          Jimmy pans back and forth and up and down his dead body.
          
                                                             67.
          
          
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    What are you doing?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                        (it's obvious)
                    I'm filming.
          
                                 JUDY (O.C.)
                    It's dark.     You can't see anything.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    It's on infra-red. Do you wanna
                    see?
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    No, I don't wanna see.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    He's beautiful. He really is.
                    There's a certain serenity to death
                    I appreciate.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    He's dead. He's in my car, Jimmy,
                    and he stinks. I wanna go home.
          
          Jimmy keeps filming.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    I don't think I can do this.
          
          Jimmy ignores her.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    I'm not like you. I can't do this.
                        (holds back a sob)
                    I wanna fucking go home.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Yeah, well you can't fucking go
                    home. And you will do this. You
                    did do this. You killed him. You
                    didn't get in the car until the
                    cops showed up. Now we don't have
                    a choice. You want me to go to
                    jail? You want that?
          
                                JUDY (O.C.)
                          (softer)
                    No.
          
          Judy settles.   Jimmy is out of breath.
          
                                                                  68.
          
          
          
          The sun is beginning to rise. The light of a new day
          cascades upon the dead body in the trunk.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                        (half crying)
                    What are we going to do?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    We just need to make intelligent
                    decisions. That's all. We'll find
                    a way to take care of it. Then
                    we'll go away. We'll fix it.
                    It'll be okay. I promise.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    You promise?
          
                               JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Yeah.   Come here.
          
          Jimmy has dropped the camera away from the Homeless Man.
          He's still rolling while he wraps his arms around her and
          holds her.
          
          We hear him kissing her softly.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna take
                    care of everything. I promise.
          
          Camera shuts down.
          
                                                         CAMERA ON:
          
          INT. WOODS IN NOWHERE - HOMELESS MAN ROAST - NIGHT
          
          We see and hear a huge roaring fire. Jimmy has zoomed the
          lens in so close that we can't tell what it is that's
          burning.
          
          As he pulls out, it's revealed that the dead homeless guy is
          roasting in the fire.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                        (coughing)
                    Oh, my god. The hair burning is
                    making me nauseous.
          
          Judy coughs more violently before.
          
                                                                  69.
          
          
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Yeah, God damn. Burning bodies
                    fucking stinks. That bum's body
                    odor is being cooked right off him.
          
          Jimmy pokes the flaming skull with his stick.
          
                                JUDY (O.C.)
                    Jimmy!
          
          Jimmy pokes some more at the body, then flips the camera up
          at Judy.
          
                                JUDY
                    What?    I'm not in the mood.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                        (making light)
                    Don't have to be in the mood.
                    Doesn't matter. The camera's on,
                    it's on.
                        (changes the subject)
                    You wanna know where we're gonna
                    go?
          
                              JUDY
                    Okay, where are we gonna go?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    We're going to Lincoln to visit
                    Dinko.
          
                              JUDY
                    Who's Dinko, Jimmy?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    He's cool. And he's got his own
                    place, and he said I could stay
                    there whenever ever I wanted. Plus
                    he knows about you and he wants to
                    meet you. And he doesn't like
                    cops, so he's not gonna call 'em.
                    Okay? Now gimme a smile.
          
                                JUDY
                    No.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Gimme a smile, and I'll let you see
                    my smiley face again.
          
          Judy begins coughing.
          
                                                                  70.
          
          
          
                              JUDY
                    I can't get sexy with that smell.
                    I just can't.
          
          Camera shuts down.
          
                                                          CAMERA ON:
          
          INT. DINKO'S TRAILER - NIGHT
          
          Music is playing extremely loud in a funky ass trailer as
          Judy dances with DINKO (late 20s) a completely drunk trailer
          trash dude wearing a pizza delivery outfit.
          
          Empty whiskey and beer bottles are scattered throughout the
          tiny living room as cigarette smoke hovers around them due to
          a ridiculously low ceiling.
          
          Judy is dancing in a very sexy manner with Dinko who is
          dancing like a complete dork. Dinko has no moves, rhythm, or
          beat whatsoever, but dances with as much vigor as a dog on
          crack.
          
          Jimmy is sitting on the couch filming them dancing in front
          of him. Dinko is forced to scream over top of the music to
          be heard. He looks directly at Jimmy noticing that Jimmy's
          turned on the camera.
          
                              DINKO
                    Hey! The video-man. I remember
                    that shit when we was in together.
                    Said you video-ed everything.
          
                               JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Yep.
          
                              DINKO
                    Hey man, it's cool if you guys stay
                    here for a while, but I have a
                    small business to run man. There's
                    going to be some people knocking on
                    the door and shit. I can't have
                    you guys answering the door or the
                    phone. That's the only rule.
                    Other than that man, we're going to
                    getting fucked up together all the
                    time. I got a shit load of crank
                    dude, that shit is off the fucking
                    hook. Here, take a hit.
          
          Dinko tries to hand off some crank to Jimmy.
          
                                                                    71.
          
          
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    No thanks, I just want to film Judy
                    dancing.
          
          Jimmy pans the camera over towards Judy.    She's doing her
          best sexy dance into the camera.
          
          We can still hear Dinko talking to Jimmy.
          
                              DINKO (O.C.)
                    Right man. That's cool. Hey um...
                    If I tell you to stop taping
                    though, man, you gotta stop. I got
                    some hard core junkies coming over
                    here. Sometimes, if they see shit
                    like that, they fucking flip.
                    Crank junkies are a whole different
                    kind of breed man. They're fucking
                    hard core mother fuckers. You
                    don't know what they're gonna
                    fucking do. This one guy got
                    paranoid about something. He used
                    to climb on his roof to take a
                    dump. That's the only place he
                    would shit! How fucked up is that?
          
          Dinko laughs at his own joke.
          
                              JUDY
                    You're not even paying attention to
                    me Jimmy.
          
          Judy takes her dancing up a notch to get Jimmy's attention.
          
                              JUDY
                    Don't I look sexy?
          
          Jimmy doesn't get a chance to respond.
          
                               DINKO (O.C.)
                    Yeah, you look real sexy baby.
                    Real nice.
          
          Dinko starts in with Jimmy again.
          
                              DINKO (O.C.)
                    Hey, I may have some work for you
                    if you're cool with that.
          
          Jimmy turns the camera back to Dinko while he goes to the
          kitchen to get a beer.
          
                                                                  72.
          
          
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    What kind of work?
          
                               DINKO
                    You know some hustling, some good
                    money. I'll teach you how to mix
                    the shit. Your girlfriend too if
                    she wants.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                        (sarcasm)
                    Yeah. That's what I've always
                    wanted to do. Learn to make and
                    sell crystal methamphetamine.
                    You're a fucking genius Dinko.
          
          Dinko is too stupid to recognize sarcasm.
          
                              DINKO
                        (big smile)
                    Yeah, man! Fuckin' high five.
          
          Dinko high five's Jimmy and laughs again.
          
                              DINKO
                        (re: Judy)
                    So is she, like, your girlfriend or
                    are you guys just fucking?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    She's my girlfriend, my best
                    friend, and yes we fuck. And don't
                    ever, ever fucking touch her.
                    That's MY only rule Dinko.
          
          Judy is frustrated with Jimmy's lack of attention.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Jimmy!
          
          Jimmy turns the camera to her. She's starting to do her best
          impression of a stripper dance.
          
                              DINKO
                    It's all good man. I ain't gonna
                    touch your old lady. Shit man,
                    she's so into you anyway.
          
          Dinko gets up and moves into the kitchen area, crossing the
          frame. Jimmy focusses the camera's attention on various
          items in the kitchen while Dinko talks.
          
                                                                    73.
          
          
          
          There's ripped open small electronics and appliances
          everywhere, as if Dinko's been taking everything apart and
          trying to put it back together.
          
                              DINKO
                    So there's this dude. Fucker
                    taught me everything I know about
                    meth and shit. He'd fucking flip
                    for your girl, man. You should go
                    up and see him. He's in Erlanger.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Uncle Rodney?
          
          Camera drifts across several messy piles of papers and
          cardboard boxes with bags of drugs in them.
          
                              DINKO (O.C.)
                    Right, right! I forgot.     Yeah,
                    Uncle Rodney!
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    You have an Uncle Rodney baby?
          
          Judy is too stoned to realize that Jimmy has already told her
          about Uncle Rodney.
          
          Jimmy pulls out to include Judy in the shot. She's in the
          kitchen doing another line of crank off a counter top.
          
                              JUDY
                    I want to meet your uncle.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    He's not my uncle. He's not
                    anybody's uncle. People just call
                    him that. He's the one I told you
                    about from the nut house.
          
          As Judy bends down to snort her line, camera drifts over to
          Dinko who's holding a HUGE HILLBILLY WAD OF CASH in his hand
          and stuffs it into a box of cereal. Jimmy zooms in on the
          cereal box. There's a whole bunch more cash in there.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    I said one day I'd take you up to
                    Erlanger one day, remember?
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    When was that?
          
          Dinko throws the cash on the table.    Jimmy ZOOMS OUT catching
          Judy in the frame.
          
                                                                  74.
          
          
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    When we were naked.
          
                              JUDY
                    We're always naked, Jimmy.
          
          Judy wipes powder from her nose, then goes foggy for a split
          second, losing then catching her balance.
          
                              JUDY
                        (re: crank)
                    Fuck... Woah, that's cool.
          
                              DINKO (O.C.)
                    That's some good shit, huh?
          
                              JUDY
                        (disoriented)
                    Uh huh...
          
          Jimmy turns the camera onto Dinko.
          
                              DINKO
                    So you guys should like, totally go
                    see him, man. I don't fuckin' go
                    up there no more, 'cuz like, I got
                    all the shit I need right here man,
                    'cuz my place is cool and all, but
                    there's no fucking room here, ya
                    know? So like you should go see
                    him and shit.
          
          Judy steps into frame. At this point, she's in her bra and
          is dancing like a stripper directly in front of the camera.
          
                              JUDY
                    You like this, Jimmy?
          
          THERE'S A KNOCK at the door.
          
                                DINKO (O.C.)
                          (calls out to door)
                    Yo!
                        (to Jimmy)
                    Customers call.
          
          Judy keeps on dancing in her own little world while Dinko
          goes to the door. Judy finishes her bottle of beer. She's
          pretty drunk and cranked out at this point.
          
                                                                     75.
          
          
          
          Dinko is at the front door dealing with a customer. We can't
          see her and we can barely hear what they're talking about,
          but it seems Dinko is engaged in a heated conversation with
          her. He yells back into the living room from the front door.
          
                                 DINKO (O.C.)
                    Yo, Jimmy.     Is your girl into
                    chicks?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    I don't know.
                        (to Judy)
                    Are you into chicks?
          
                              JUDY
                    Do you want me to be into chicks?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                        (calls to her)
                    Sure Dinko. Bring her in.
          
          Dinko brings in HAZEL,(40), a frightfully thin crank addict.
          She's scared, nervous, and completely strung out, and she
          looks like death. They stand off to the side of the room
          watching Judy dance.
          
          Judy realizes the woman is in the room and stops dancing.
          
          Jimmy zooms in on the woman. Looking closer we see that
          Hazel is in the final stages of her life/addiction. She's
          sweating and her eyes are bugging out of her skull.
          
          Dinko turns the music down so they don't have to scream.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    You know what, never mind Dink.    I
                    don't think Judy's into chicks.
          
                              JUDY
                    Yeah, I'm not into chicks.
          
                              DINKO
                    Well Hazel here will do anything we
                    want. Ain't that right Hazel?
          
          Hazel nods her head yes.
          
                              DINKO
                    You're into chicks aren't you
                    Hazel?
          
                                                                      76.
          
          
          
                              HAZEL
                    Um, I really just want to get some
                    stuff and get out of here.
          
          Hazel is trembling.    The party atmosphere has come to a
          complete halt.
          
                              DINKO
                    Shut up you fat fucking junkie and
                    take your clothes off or you ain't
                    getting shit.
          
          Hazel's not moving.    She's reluctant.
          
                                 DINKO
                    Come on!
          
                                 HAZEL
                    I don't...
          
          Dinko smacks her square in the face.
          
                              DINKO
                        (screaming)
                    Just do it, you fucking whore!
          
          Hazel starts to take her clothes off reluctantly.
          
                                 JUDY
                    Jimmy.
          
          Jimmy doesn't do anything.     He just keeps filming.
          
                              JUDY
                    Jimmy, stop him!
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    He's a big boy, he can do what he
                    wants.
          
          This gives Dinko an added boost of confidence. Hazel is now
          in her bra and panties and is standing in front of them.
          
                              DINKO
                    Ever made a porno?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Not with you.
          
                                                                  77.
          
          
          
                              DINKO
                    Well all right! Keep filming
                    mother fucker, I'm gonna fuck this
                    junkie for you. You guys are free
                    to join in whenever you like.
          
          Judy is now borderline hysterical.
          
                              JUDY
                    I swear to God Jimmy if you let him
                    go through with this I'll never
                    talk to you again!
          
          Jimmy ignores her.
          
                                 DINKO
                    You ready?     You filming?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    I'm filming. Are you going to fuck
                    her or are you just gonna talk
                    about it?
          
                              JUDY
                        (screaming)
                    Jimmy!
          
          Dinko unbuckles his belt as fast as he can. Hazel begins to
          cry as Dinko pushes her into position on all fours.
          
                              DINKO
                        (to Jimmy)
                    How's this? You getting good
                    camera angles and shit?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Turn her ass towards the camera.
          
                              DINKO
                        (laughing it up)
                    Take off them panties bitch...   Oh
                    yeah! Come on bitch. Move.
          
          Judy is crying profusely in the background as Dinko pushes
          Hazel to the ground. Jimmy zooms in on Dinko, framing out
          Hazel as Dinko gets himself ready to take her from behind.
          
                                 DINKO
                    That's it.     Just like that.
          
          Dinko looks directly at the lens of the camera.
          
                                                                      78.
          
          
          
                              DINKO
                    We're going to be doing this shit
                    all the time brother.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    You think so?
          
                                 DINKO
                    Fuck yeah!
          
          Dinko sees something O.C. from Jimmy, we can't see that
          surprises him.
          
                              DINKO
                    You don't have to hold a gun to her
                    head man. There's plenty of other
                    chicks we can do that to. If
                    that's what you're into, then fuck
                    it, I'll...
          
          BAM!!!
          
          Dinko takes a shot in the throat and falls onto Hazel.
          Jimmy's shot him.
          
          Judy has stopped screaming. Hazel on the other hand is
          freaking out, trapped under a squirming Dinko.
          
          Jimmy sets the camera on top of something, stands up and
          brings the gun to Judy.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Take it!
          
          Judy doesn't know what to do.   Jimmy puts the gun in her
          hand.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Finish him off! He deserves a
                    bullet right in the fucking face,
                    doesn't he?
          
          Judy's in a weird cranked out place.
          
                              JUDY
                        (nervous, cranked out)
                    Yeah. Yeah. He does.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Then do it.
          
          Judy points the gun at a still squirming Dinko.   She can't
          bring herself to pull the trigger.
          
                                                                   79.
          
          
          
          We can hear Dinko choking on his own blood.   He struggles to
          move towards Judy.
          
          Jimmy's now standing behind Judy. He wraps his hand around
          hers, helps her point the gun and...
          
          BAM
          
          Shoots Dinko right between the eyes.   Jimmy helps her again.
          
          BAM-BAM
          
          Two more shots into his chest, Jimmy's hand still wrapped
          around Judy's over the gun.
          
          Jimmy lets go of her hand and the gun drops to the floor.
          She's stunned.
          
          Jimmy comes towards camera and shuts it down.
          
                                                          CAMERA ON:
          
          I/E. ROAD LEAVING TRAILER/DINKO'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          A rip roaring fire burns from the trailer. Jimmy is shooting
          out of the back of the Dinko's Car, a beat up old station
          wagon, as they drive away down the gravel road.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Good bye Dinko, mother fucker.
                    Thanks for letting us borrow your
                    car, and for the cash.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    And for the crank!
          
          Jimmy sits back into his seat and turns the camera on Judy.
          She's got a big smile on her face.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    You feeling good baby?
          
                              JUDY
                    I feel calm. I don't care about
                    anything.
          
          Jimmy keeps filming.
          
                               JUDY
                    What are we going to do with the
                    car Jimmy?
          
                                                                    80.
          
          
          
                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Ditch it.
          
                                 JUDY
                    The crank?
          
                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Snort it.     Give some of it away.
          
                                 JUDY
                    The cash.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Vacation baby. Anywhere we want to
                    go.
          
          Judy smiles. She turns and blows a kiss towards the camera,
          oddly serene from the drugs despite everything that's
          happened. To her, it's as if all is right with the world.
          
          Camera shuts down.
          
                                                           CAMERA ON:
          
          INT. LAS VEGAS - WEDDING CHAPEL - NIGHT
          
          Jimmy is standing on the altar waiting for his bride to be.
          He is wearing a white tuxedo with black tie and ruffle shirt
          like Ricardo Montalban from Fantasy Island.
          
          They are being married by an Elvis impersonator and the
          witnesses/groomsmen are Siegfried and Roy look-a-likes.
          
          Jimmy waves to the person who is working the camera.   The
          Elvis impersonator talks to Jimmy.
          
                              ELVIS
                    You know the video's gonna cost you
                    twenty extra, right?
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Yeah.
          
                              ELVIS
                    Well alright then.    Let's get this
                    sum bitch started!
          
          Elvis reaches down and gets a guitar and breaks into an Elvis
          version of "Here Comes the Bride" but to the song "You ain't
          Nothing But A Hound Dog."
          
                                                                  81.
          
          
          
                              ELVIS
                    Weeeeeelllll, you ain't nothing but
                    a young bride... walking down the
                    aisle.
          
          The Elvis impersonator goes all out with the dance and the
          gyrating Elvis hips as he jams on his acoustic guitar.
          
          Jimmy motions to the camera to turn around.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Here she comes.
          
                              ELVIS (O.C.)
                    You ain't nothing but a young
                    bride... walking down the aisle.
          
          The camera whips around and we see Judy walking down the
          aisle. Tears of joy run down Judy's heavily made up face as
          she walks.
          
                              ELVIS
                    Well, if you don't marry Jimmy,
                    then you ain't no friend of mine.
          
          Judy makes her way over to her side of the altar next to her
          bridesmaids (two Cher look-a-likes).
          
                                ELVIS
                    Do you...
          
          Elvis is looking for Judy's name that's been scribbled on
          paper.
          
                              JIMMY
                        (helping)
                    Judy. And here, we wrote our own
                    vows.
          
          He hands Elvis a small piece of paper who skims it. He kind
          of shakes his head, smirking at what he reads, then decides
          to go for it.
          
          Elvis gives a quick windmill strum to his guitar and starts.
          
                              ELVIS
                    Do you Judy promise to always
                    swallow, to never cut your hair, or
                    have another man's penis injected
                    into any part of your body for as
                    long as you both shall live?
          
          The Cher bridesmaids giggle.
          
                                                                     82.
          
          
          
                               JUDY
                    I do.
          
                              ELVIS
                    Do you Jimmy promise to always fuck
                    Judy with enthusiasm, to take a
                    shower once a day, and promise not
                    to inject your penis into any part
                    of another person's body as long as
                    you both shall live?
          
                               JIMMY
                    I do.
          
                              ELVIS
                    Can I get the rings?
          
          Siegfried gives the rings to Jimmy who places one on Judy's
          finger and vice versa.
          
                              ELVIS
                    With the power vested in me by the
                    great state of Nevada... I do
                    herby pronounce you husband and
                    wife. You may kiss the bride.
          
          Jimmy and Judy grab each other by the ass and begin making
          out.
          
          The freak show audience claps while they are making out. The
          applauding dies down but Jimmy and Judy continue to make out.
          Jimmy puts his hand up her dress as she begins unbuckling his
          pants. It looks like they may start fucking on the alter.
          
          Elvis jumps in to break it up.
          
                              ELVIS
                    All right you two.     We got a
                    schedule to keep.
          
          Camera shuts down.
          
                                                            CAMERA ON:
          
          INT. LAS VEGAS - LAS VEGAS MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Jimmy is running through    the motel room with the camera.
          Flashes of snorted lines    of crank dust and rolled up bills
          are in the background as    Jimmy moves through the room. We
          hear Judy screaming with    excitement about something on the
          TV.
          
                                                                  83.
          
          
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Hurry up Jimmy, hurry, hurry,
                    hurry, shit Jimmy. You're going to
                    miss it.
          
          Jimmy settles camera on the television.
          
          BEGIN TV NEWS REPORT
          
          On TV, Jimmy and Judy's high school year book pictures are on
          the screen.
          
          INT. TV NEWS STUDIO - (FOR VEGAS MOTEL TV) - NIGHT
          
          An ANCHORMAN is mid-sentence, talking about Jimmy and Judy.
          
                              ANCHORMAN
                    ...press conference in a few

                               JUDY (O.C.)
                    No it's not! I'm Judy Wright now!
                        (sing songy, like a little
                         girl)
                    I'm Judy Wright now!
          
                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Shhhh...     Shut up!
          
                              ANCHORMAN
                    ...from Burlington, Kentucky are
                    wanted for questioning in the
                    alleged murder of a Hamilton County
                    Sheriff's Deputy that was killed
                    two nights ago while on Patrol in
                    the Over the Rhine section of
                    Cincinnati. On a very serious
                    note, the producers here at KPX-TV
                    4 would like to warn you that the
                    images we are about to show are
                    violent and graphic in nature and
                    may not be suitable for young
                    children. Once again, these are
                    the images that were taken from a
                    video camera that was mounted on
                    board the patrol car. Viewer
                    discretion is advised.
          
          Judy gasps involuntarily as...
          
                                                                      84.
          
          
          
          INT. LAS VEGAS - LAS VEGAS MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Jimmy pulls the camera from the screen and points it at Judy
          to get her reaction. Her eyes are locked on the screen.
          
          Judy's face drops. We, on the other hand, are dying to see
          what she's looking at.
          
          Jimmy swish pans back to the TV and zooms in tight.   The
          television fills the frame.
          
          EXT. GHETTO - COP CAR CAM (FOR VEGAS MOTEL) - NIGHT
          
          (From Sc. 37, p. 64) On screen we see something completely
          new. It's a black and white security cam style video image.
          Just as the announcer described, this is the kind of image
          that comes from a video camera that's mounted on the inside
          of a Cop Car. It's static and covered with date/time text,
          etc.
          
          On TV, we finally get a chance to see what transpired when
          Jimmy and Judy were pulled over. Judy is standing outside
          the cop car. The moment she sees it approach, we see her
          freak just a bit and get into the car quickly and
          suspiciously. The cop gets up, gets out of the car and goes
          over to the driver side to talk to Jimmy. After a few
          moments, he summons Jimmy out of the car while Judy waits.
          
          The Cop asks Jimmy to open the trunk. He doesn't have his
          gun drawn, but he is being cautious, one hand on his gun
          holster, the other shining on Jimmy's face with a flashlight.
          
                              COP
                        (on TV)
                    Go ahead and open it.
          
          Jimmy stands by the trunk of the car, but he's not really
          obeying the Cop's commands. He's stalling. The Cop is
          getting suspicious. We can barely hear what they're saying
          to each other over the noise of traffic that whizzes by.
          
          There's an unintelligible exchange, then... the cop steps
          forward, raising his voice.
          
                              COP
                        (on TV)
                    Put your hands on the vehicle.
          
          Jimmy's reluctant.
          
                              COP
                        (on TV)
                    On the vehicle, now!
          
                                                                     85.
          
          
          
          The Cop and Jimmy are sort of at a standoff.    Jimmy finally
          leans over and puts his hands on the trunk.
          
          The Cop comes in close to Jimmy, pulling his hand from his
          gun holster and shifting it to pull his cuffs off his belt.
          
          At that exact moment, Jimmy makes his move, LEAPING for the
          Cop.
          
          He takes the Cop to the ground and off screen.
          
          All we see is a barely decipherable image of Judy freaking
          out in the passenger seat because she can't see what's going
          on and neither can we.
          
          About 5 seconds go by.
          
          BOOM!
          
          A gunshot is fired.
          
          It feels like an eternity, then...
          
          Jimmy pops up off the ground. He's got the Cop's gun! He
          hesitates, not knowing what to do. He pauses, hesitant, then
          shoots down towards the ground, where the cop is lying out of
          frame.
          
          He runs around the front of the car and into the driver seat.
          
          There's a moment of hesitation as Jimmy and Judy seem to be
          screaming at each other in the car, then...
          
          Jimmy slams on the gas and the car takes off into the
          distance.
          
          The image on the TV cuts away and back to the Anchorman.
          
          INT. TV NEWS STUDIO (FOR VEGAS MOTEL TV) - NIGHT
          
          The Anchorman speaks to camera as...
          
          INT. LAS VEGAS - LAS VEGAS MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Jimmy pans up to Judy, hoping to record a reaction. She's
          locked on the TV, her hand over her mouth, frozen, not
          knowing how to react.
          
          She turns and looks up at him.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    I didn't want us to be apart.
          
                                                                    86.
          
          
          
          Judy's starting to tear up. She's emotional, conflicted.
          She can't believe he did that for her, but she's also just
          come to the sober realization that he killed a cop in cold
          blood for her.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    They know who we are now.
                        (making light)
                    Actually, we're famous now.
          
          Judy kind of half smiles. She hadn't thought of it, but
          she's still trying to digest the images until...
          
                              JUDY
                    That's the most romantic thing I've
                    ever even heard of.
          
          A voice catches Judy's attention from the TV. It's an
          ATTORNEY type at a press conference being held by Jimmy's
          parents.
          
                              ATTORNEY (O.C.)
                        (on TV)
                    ...have a few words and then we'll
                    be taking questions.
          
          Judy looks back at the TV.
          
                              JUDY
                    Oh my God, that's my parents!   And
                    your parents!
          
          Jimmy pans back and we see...
          
          EXT. COURTHOUSE - PODIUM PRESS CONF. (FOR VEAGS TV) - DAY
          
          Jimmy's Mom and Dad with a chiron at the bottom of frame.
          They're at a podium with Judy's parents standing stoically in
          the background. Jimmy's Mom starts reading a prepared
          statement.
          
                              JIMMY'S MOM
                        (on TV)
                    We are very shocked about recent
                    events. Our son has always been a
                    dear sweet boy who is sometimes
                    confused, but we want him to know
                    that we love him very, very much
                    and just want this whole thing to
                    be over.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Bitch.
          
                                                                   87.

                    Shhhh...
          
          Judy's Dad steps up to the microphone.   Despite the truth, he
          sounds genuinely concerned.
          
                              JUDY'S DAD
                    Jimmy if you're out there, we know
                    you're scared, but you're only
                    making it worse. Please bring Judy
                    back to us. We really miss her
                    terribly.
          
          Jim walks over to the TV and...
          
          INT. LAS VEGAS - LAS VEGAS MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Jimmy proceeds to kick the living fuck out of the TV.   It
          smashes against the wall and falls to the floor.
          
          END TV NEWS REPORT
          
          Camera shuts down.
          
                                                           CAMERA ON:
          
          INT. BUN BOY MOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY
          
          Jimmy is filming the both of them in the mirror. Judy stands
          above him with noticeably different hair. She has obviously
          given herself a homemade dye job, complete with blonde, black
          and punk pink streaks.
          
          Judy has an electric clipper and is about to shave Jimmy's
          head, who is sitting in a chair below her. She's really
          getting off on this and chuckles as she starts to lower the
          shaver to his head.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Wait a second.
          
                               JUDY

                    I just want to look at myself one
                    last time with hair.
          
          Judy is smiling and can't wait to get started.
          
                              JUDY
                    OK, that's enough.
          
                                                                  88.
          
          
          
          She starts in again.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Stop.
          
                              JUDY
                    What's the matter?
          
                              JIMMY
                    I'm not sure about this.
          
                                 JUDY
                    Come on.     I changed mine.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Yeah, but you look fucking great.
          
                              JUDY
                    This was your idea Jimmy.
          
          Jimmy thinks.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Fuck it.     Let's do this thing.
          
          Judy starts the shaver back up and proceeds to shave Jimmy's
          head. She starts right down the middle.
          
          Hair falls into Jimmy's face as Judy slides the buzzer from
          front to back. Jimmy now has a reverse Mohawk. He laughs at
          himself along with Judy.
          
                              JIMMY
                    This is the look.
          
          Judy then shaves the entire top of Jimmy's head, giving him
          the quintessential male pattern baldness look.
          
          He looks ridiculous.
          
                              JIMMY
                        (joking)
                    Let's just leave it like this.
          
          Judy laughs.
          
                              JUDY
                    Don't be stupid.
          
          Judy shaves the rest of his head and now Jimmy is completely
          bald.
          
          Jimmy checks himself out in the mirror.
          
                                                                   89.
          
          
          
                              JIMMY
                    I am one ugly mother fucker.
          
          Judy is stroking the top of his head with her hands.
          
                              JUDY
                    It feels funny.
          
          Jimmy gives it a feel for himself.   He sticks his pinky in
          the side of his mouth.
          
                              JIMMY
                    I look like Dr. Evil.
          
          Judy laughs, then kisses the top of Jimmy's head.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Come on. Let's go across the
                    street and get a shit burger.
          
          Jimmy shuts down the camera.
          
                                                          CAMERA ON:
          
          I/E. BUN BOY - DINER/PARKING LOT/DINKO'S CAR - HIGHWAY - DAY
          
          In a booth at the motel diner, Judy is filming Jimmy while he
          stuffs a burger into his face.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    You're such a fucking pig when you
                    eat.
          
          Jimmy opens his mouth full of food and comes towards camera.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Aaaaaaaaaahhh!
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Gross. That's it. I'm not taking
                    you to the country club, ever!
          
          That didn't quite sit right with him, but he covers it up
          with a mock pout while he chews.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                        (mocking)
                    Awww... I'm sorry. Did I hurt your
                    feelings?
          
          Jimmy won't respond, playful.
          
                                                                    90.
          
          
          
                               JUDY (O.C.)
                    I'll take you to the country club.
                    I promise.
          
          Jimmy looks up smiling.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    When?
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    I don't know.
          
          Judy pauses.   Jimmy keeps chewing.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Thanks for marrying me. You're my
                    prince charming that came and
                    swooped me off me feet.
          
          The irony is thick. Bald, lanky, 21 year old Jimmy with a
          mouth full of food looks like anything but Prince Charming.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    And one day, we're gonna have a
                    house and a white picket fence and
                    a baby. Tell me what you think we
                    should name the baby.
          
          Jimmy stops smiling.    She really believes that's going to
          happen one day.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    What's wrong?
          
          Jimmy doesn't want to answer.    While he thinks...
          
          Something out the window distracts him.
          
                                 JUDY (O.C.)
                    What?
          
                              JIMMY
                    Shhhh. Shut up.
                        (grabbing camera)
                    Give it to me.
          
          Jimmy whips the camera around to zoom in on what he's looking
          through the window. Finally, we see...
          
          Two Florence County Sheriff's Cars with their lights flashing
          are parked in the parking lot of the cheap motel.
          
          Jimmy zooms in on the cops as they get out of their cars.
          
                                                                     91.
          
          
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    What are they doing?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Shhh.
          
          The cops walk up to one of the doors to the motel room.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Shit.
          
          Four Florence Deputies stand outside the motel room door,
          ready to bust it in and raid the room.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    What?
          
          Jimmy speaks in hushed tones so that others in the diner
          won't hear them.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    They're outside our room.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Oh God, Jimmy! They know where we
                    are. We're going to get caught!
          
          Florence Deputy #1 knocks on the door, waits a beat, then
          busts it down. Three Florence Deputies move in with their
          guns drawn.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Jimmy!
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                        (to self)
                    Let's go.
          
          Jimmy forgets to shut the camera down. He holds it by his
          waist as the two quickly struggle to get the hell out of the
          diner.
          
          Follow along with them, camera by Jimmy's side, mostly
          pointing randomly at the floor of the diner or out the
          window.
          
          They head out the door to the...
          
          PARKING LOT
          
          Action continues, the camera still rolling without Jimmy
          realizing it. They run at a fast clip along the parking lot
          as they head toward...
          
                                                                    92.
          
          
          
          DINKO'S CAR
          
                                JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Get in.
          
           Jimmy slides into   the driver seat and throws the camera onto
          the dashboard. We    see Jimmy behind the wheel as they drive
          out of the parking   lot. He's in freak-out mode, afraid as
          hell they're going   to be caught by the cops.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    They don't see us.
          
                                JIMMY
                    I know.    Just shut up!   Let me
                    think.
          
          Jimmy keeps driving, his eyes darting back and forth between
          the road, the rear view mirror and Judy.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Are they coming?
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    I don't know. I don't think so.
          
          Jimmy looks back up into the rear view mirror, still not 100%
          satisfied that they're not being chased.
          
                               JUDY (O.C.)
                    No.   I don't think they're coming.
          
          Jimmy's still not certain. He looks for a while. Then he
          sighs. It seems that he knows they're not coming.
          
                              JIMMY
                        (relief)
                    Oh, fuck.
                        (to Judy)
                    That was close.
          
          Jimmy drives for a bit, then notices that the camera is on
          and pointing at him. He reaches forward and...
          
          Camera shuts down.
          
                                                           CAMERA ON:
          
          I/E. PARKING AREA BY RIVER AFTER BUN BOY ESCAPE/DINKO'S CAR -
          DAY
          
          Jimmy films Judy, who is sleeping in the front seat of the
          car.
          
                                                                      93.
          
          
          
          Jimmy gently wakes her.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Hey baby, wake up baby. Time to
                    get up little fuck nugget.
          
          Judy opens her eyes.    The first thing she sees is Jimmy
          filming her.
          
          Judy smiles like an infant who sees her daddy for the first
          time after a night's sleep. Judy, very childlike, opens her
          arms for Jimmy to hug her.
          
          Jimmy leans over, camera in hand, and gives her a hug. The
          camera shakes and goes out of focus as he's hugging her.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Good morning Mrs. Wright. And how
                    are we feeling this afternoon?
          
          Judy looks around and is a bit disoriented.
          
                              JUDY
                    Where are we?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    It's a surprise. Come on. I want
                    you to drive us in. I want to film
                    you when we get there.
          
                              JUDY
                        (big smile)
                    Okay.
          
          Camera shuts down.
          
                                                           CAMERA ON:
          
          I/E. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - BACKROAD ENTRY/PARKING
          AREA/DINKO'S CAR - DAY
          
          Judy drives up a gravel road as Jimmy films.    They travel
          through the back roads in Northern Kentucky.    It's nothing
          but woods outside the window.
          
                              JUDY
                    What am I gonna see?
          
          Jimmy doesn't answer.
          
                              JUDY
                    I hate it when you do that.    Tell
                    me!
          
                                                                    94.
          
          
          
                                JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Nope.    Keep looking.
          
          Judy drives some more.    The camera is bouncing as they drive
          across dirt roads.
          
          Judy tries to maintain her composure, but she can't contain
          herself.
          
                              JUDY
                    How much further!    Aaa!
          
                                JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Shhh.    Just drive.
          
          Judy bites her lip and drives.    Slowly, she comes around a
          bend as they arrive at...
          
          UNCLE RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND/PARKING AREA
          
          Judy's eyes go wide.
          
                                 JUDY
                    Oh my God.     Is that it?
          
          Jimmy doesn't say anything. He just keeps the camera trained
          on Judy. By the look on her face, what she's seeing looks
          pretty cool.
          
                              JUDY
                    Is this where your friend lives?
          
          Jimmy points the camera through the front windshield. Now we
          see what Judy was seeing... about thirty trailers, all along
          the water's edge.
          
          It looks like a commune for run-away teenagers with crank
          addictions and budding/wannabe drug dealers. The kids are
          throwing a combination party, barbecue, and drug festival.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    This is where we live.
          
                                 JUDY
                    We do?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Maybe. If you want to.       For a
                    little while.
          
          Judy doesn't respond. She just drives. Her eyes are
          starting to well up a little bit. She's getting emotional.
          
                                                                      95.
          
          
          
                              JUDY
                    This is sooo amazing.       It's like a
                    dream.
          
          Judy's on cloud nine.    The place has exceeded her
          expectations.
          
          Judy keeps driving as we see young people, all more or less
          the same age as Jimmy and Judy. Some live in trailers, some
          in tents. They watch as Jimmy and Judy drive in. Clearly
          new faces are of interest to them.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Go over here.
          
          Out the window, they approach another trailer.      Clearly this
          trailer is more important than the others.
          
          Outside, a dorky looking douche bag type, BUDDY (20's) talks
          to some of the Younger People in intense language. They all
          look over to see Jimmy and Judy approaching.
          
                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Stop here.
          
          You can hear the excitement in Jimmy's voice as Judy stops
          the car.
          
                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Take it.
          
          Jimmy hands off the camera to Judy, who retrains it on the
          Buddy and the Wunderland Teenagers he talks to.
          
          Jimmy gets out of Dinko's car and heads up to him while Judy
          films. We don't hear the conversation between Jimmy and
          Buddy man, but clearly he's happy to see Jimmy.
          
          Buddy gives Jimmy a big hug like he was a missed relative or
          an old friend. It's all smiles between the two of them.
          
          Jimmy comes running back over to the car.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Is that Uncle Rodney?
          
                              JIMMY
                    No, that's Buddy. He said Rodney's
                    been expecting us. We're, like,
                    celebrities or something Judy.
          
                                 JUDY (O.C.)
                    Really?
          
                                                                     96.
          
          
          
                               JIMMY
                    Yeah!   He wants to meet you.
          
                               JUDY
                    Wow.
          
          Camera shakes as Judy starts out of the car.    Camera shuts
          down.
          
                                                           CAMERA ON:
          
          EXT. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - OUTSIDE RODNEY'S TRAILER - DAY
          
          Buddy is standing outside of a Piece Of Shit Trailer. He's
          the douche bag type that we saw from a distance give Jimmy a
          hug in the previous scene.
          
          He's surprisingly charismatic and gracious and does his best
          to make Jimmy and Judy feel at home.
          
          Jimmy films as Buddy gives them a walking tour of the group
          of trailers by the river. Judy's with them as well.
          
                              BUDDY
                    We got like thirty five trailers
                    here. Long as we've got some
                    that's empty you can stay in one.
                    Sometimes people come in and we got
                    get you a tent or-- fuck,
                    everybody's friendly--- you can
                    always find a bed to crash in.
          
          Jimmy's panning around the landscape. People are watching
          them walk with Buddy. It's almost as if they've got some
          kind of celebrity status because they're with him.
          
                              BUDDY
                    It don't look like much but we do
                    some pretty good partying around
                    here. Ya'll are welcome to stay as
                    long as ya like. Fuck it, you can
                    stay forever. There's only two
                    rules. Don't mess around with the
                    labs which are down back there...
          
          Jimmy's panning again, but BUDDY grabs hold of the lens.
          
                              BUDDY
                    Woah... No filming that shit.
                    Seriously. That's part of rule
                    number one.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                  97.
          
                              BUDDY (cont'd)
                    Don't even go near there with the
                    camera, and two is no cops, but
                    fuck, seeing what kinda shit you
                    guys got into, I don't think we
                    gotta worry about you calling 'em
                    up for a visit.
          
          BUDDY laughs at his own joke.
          
                              BUDDY
                    Other than that, ya'll can do
                    whatever the hell you want,
                    whenever the hell you want. You
                    wanna do some of the stash at the
                    parties, that's cool too. We'd
                    like it if you do it, normally we'd
                    say you gotta sell some too, but
                    Rodney says y'all's is a special
                    case 'cuz you ain't leaving 'til
                    the heat's off for sure, that could
                    be months or... shit, years for you
                    guys. But no one up here's in a
                    fucking hurry.
          
          Jimmy pans around capturing the natural beauty and
          picturesque scenery of the camp.
          
                              BUDDY
                    Look at you. Little bitch from the
                    nut house, and you got yourself one
                    sweet looking bride! I still can't
                    get over the tits on this girl.
                        (to Judy)
                    Come here sweetheart.
          
          Jimmy pans back and catches an image of Buddy as he grabs
          Judy and puts his arm around her.
          
                              BUDDY
                    We're gonna have a party for y'all
                    tonight. You know that? We have
                    parties damn near every night, but
                    this one's gonna be special just
                    for you guys.
                        (to Judy)
                    You like that sweety?
          
          Buddy's squeezing Judy just a bit too tight.
          
                              JUDY
                    Sure Buddy.
          
                                                                    98.
          
          
          
                              BUDDY
                        (to Jimmy)
                    Nice piece of ass you got here.
                    Best you keep an eye on it so it
                    don't wander off on ya.
          
          They've arrived at a trailer.
          
                              BUDDY
                    We're here!
          
          Jimmy pans back up at the trailer that's going to be theirs.
          From the outside, it's a disaster, peeling paint and cracked
          windows.
          
          Buddy gets in front of the camera, reaching for it.
          
                              BUDDY
                    Shit! Y'all's on your honeymoon.
                    Ain't gonna film it yourselves.
          
          Buddy pulls the camera from Jimmy's hand and points it at
          Jimmy and Judy. Judy waves. Jimmy looks a bit uncomfortable
          though he tries not to show it.
          
                              BUDDY (O.C.)
                    That's nice.
          
          Shaky amateur camera style as Buddy zooms in on Judy's chest,
          closing Jimmy out of frame.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Let's go inside.
          
          Judy turns.
          
                              BUDDY (O.C.)
                        (shouting)
                    Hold on! Hold on!
          
          Camera shuts down.
          
                                                         CAMERA ON:
          
          INT. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - JIMMY & JUDY'S TRAILER - DAY
          
          Buddy films from the inside their completely destroyed
          trailer. Jimmy stands at the entrance with Judy in his arms,
          about to carry her over the threshold. They're waiting for
          BUDDY's cue.
          
                              BUDDY (O.C.)
                    And, three, two, one... Now!
          
                                                                   99.
          
          
          
          Jimmy walks in through the doorway with Judy in his arms.
          
          Buddy is exuberant.   He hums the bridal march, badly, as they
          come in.
          
                              BUDDY (O.C.)
                    All right! Look at the happy couple
                    coming into their new home.
                        (wedding march)
                    Da, da, da, dum...
          
          Buddy looks down at the camera, right into the lens.
          
                              BUDDY
                    How do you turn this thing off?
          
          After a beat, camera goes off.
          
          EXT. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - PARTY AND BARBECUE - SALLY'S SPOT -
          DAY
          
          Jimmy is filming SALLY, a very sexy and very stoned 18 year
          old girl wearing sunglasses and cowboy hat.
          
          She speaks with a heavy southern accent.
          
                              SALLY
                    Just give your love to Uncle Rodney
                    and you'll get it back ten times.
                    Don't be afraid to love him and
                    you'll learn to love yourself in
                    return. He'll teach you the cycle,
                    how we're all connected. If you
                    give yourself freely and completely
                    to him, you'll have nothing to
                    worry about. That's what I did.
          
          Camera shuts down.
          
                                                          CAMERA ON:
          
          EXT. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - PARTY AND BARBECUE - SAM'S SPOT -
          DAY
          
          Jimmy is filming Random Teens at a barbecue. Jimmy is
          interviewing SAM, a long greasy haired, nineteen year old
          wearing a heavy metal T-shirt. We see people partying and
          hanging out in the background.
          
          SAM is drinking beer from a can, smoking a cigarette, and
          looks like he hasn't showered for a couple of days. He's
          happy to be Jimmy's video subject.
          
                                                                     100.
          
          
          
          
                              SAM
                    Ya'll are going to love it here
                    man. See this?
          
          Sam motions behind him at the people partying.
          
                              SAM
                    This shit goes on every day. I
                    been here for six months man and I
                    love it. Thank God my parents
                    kicked me out... All you got do is
                    listen to Uncle Rodney and you'll
                    have the best fucking time of your
                    life. Oh, yeah.
                        (big dopey grin)
                    And don't fuck with him, 'cuz he'll
                    kick your ass!
          
          Sam laughs at his own dumb joke.     Jimmy shuts off the camera.
          
                                                              CAMERA ON:
          
          EXT. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - DOE RUN CREEK - DAY
          
          Jimmy films a naked Judy swimming in the river the
          reflections of the water obscuring her body. She's free,
          cleansed, relaxed, enjoying the sun, and having the time of
          her life. She suddenly notices the camera.
          
                              JUDY
                    Jimmy, come swimming.      The water's
                    warm.
          
                                JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Is it?
          
          Judy smiles, then slips her head under the water, coming back
          up with a smile. She looks up at him.
          
                                JUDY
                    Come on.
          
                                JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Later.    I just want to look at you
                    now.
          
                                JUDY
                    Why?
          
          Jimmy thinks.    She smiles an oh so sweet smile.
          
                                                                 101.
          
          
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Because you look happy, happier
                    than you've looked in a long time.
          
          Judy smiles even wider. She floats towards camera while
          Jimmy zooms in on her smiling face.
          
          As she comes closer...
          
          SHE SPLASHES towards the camera, trying to get Jimmy wet.
          
          Camera shakes as Jimmy hops up to avoid be splashed.
          
                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Hey!
          
          Judy LAUGHS.   Camera goes off.
          
                                                         CAMERA ON:
          
          INT. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - JIMMY & JUDY'S TRAILER - NIGHT
          
          Faint moonlight comes into the trailer from outside. Jimmy
          is filming Judy as she's just gotten into bed. She sees the
          camera's on.
          
                                 JUDY
                    Hey again.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    So you like it here?
          
          Judy smiles again.   Then...
          
                              JUDY
                    How long will they let us stay?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    It's up to Uncle Rodney.
          
          Judy smiles at the thought of Rodney.
          
                              JUDY
                    What's he like?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    I never met him. He's supposed to
                    be cool, though... and weird.
                    Weird as hell.
          
                              JUDY
                    Well if he's weird, he's great
                    weird, whatever he is.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                  102.
          
                              JUDY (cont'd)
                    If we could stay here forever, like
                    Buddy said, I wouldn't need
                    anything else.
          
          Judy's looking right over the lens into Jimmy's eyes.
          Then...
          
                              JUDY
                    The cops won't come will they?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Buddy said Rodney's cousin's the
                    Sheriff or something. Do you want
                    to meet him?
          
                              JUDY
                        (surprised)
                    The Sheriff?
          
                               JIMMY (O.C.)
                    No!   Rodney.
          
                              JUDY
                        (lights up)
                    Can I?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    I'm gonna see him tomorrow. Buddy
                    says he wants to talk to me. Maybe
                    he wants to talk to you too.
          
                                 JUDY
                    He does?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    I don't know. Buddy said he
                    thought you were pretty.
          
                                 JUDY
                    Oh my God!
          
          Judy puts her hand over her mouth.   She can't believe it.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    I told you you were. You're the
                    prettiest girl in the world.
          
          Judy's on such a cloud nine high, she's almost in tears. She
          wraps her arms around him and SQUEALS with delight, pushing
          the camera into an awkward position as she smothers him with
          kisses, then squeezes him tight, like she's going to squeeze
          the life out of him.
          
          She whispers in his ear.
          
                                                                 103.
          
          
          
                              JUDY
                        (whispers)
                    I love you Jimmy.
          
                                JIMMY
                    Me too.
          
          Camera off.
          
                                                          CAMERA ON:
          
          EXT. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - OUTSIDE RODNEY'S TRAILER - DAY
          
          Head to toe shot on Jimmy. Buddy, we'll find out in a
          second, is behind the camera. Jimmy looks at a trailer off
          screen. He's excited, a little off center and a little
          nervous.
          
          Buddy tries to film Jimmy as he's walking towards Rodney's
          trailer.
          
                              BUDDY (O.C.)
                    You nervous?
          
                                JIMMY
                          (lying)
                    No.
          
                              BUDDY (O.C.)
                    I would be.
          
                              JIMMY
                    He's suppose to be cool.
          
                              BUDDY (O.C.)
                    He's more than cool man. God, you
                    really don't have a clue do you?
          
          Jimmy stops for a second.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Um... Judy wants to meet him.   I
                    don't know if I can ask.
          
                              BUDDY (O.C.)
                    Shit man. Don't have to. She's
                    one of his girls, man. She'll meet
                    him.
          
          Jimmy stops in his tracks and looks at Buddy.
          
                              JIMMY
                    What the fuck does that mean?
          
                                                                    104.
          
          
          
                              BUDDY (O.C.)
                    Relax dude... Just like you're one
                    of his boys. Shit man, I'll give
                    you two weeks and you'll WANT her
                    to experience him. You may even
                    want to, too.
          
          Jimmy looks at Buddy, not quite sure what to do with any of
          it. Buddy senses the tension.
          
                              BUDDY (O.C.)
                    Just go see him. Here, take your
                    camera.
          
          Buddy extends the camera, lens forward.   We can see Jimmy's
          puzzled look.
          
                              BUDDY (O.C.)
                    He wants you to film him, man.
                    With the camera. He'll tell you
                    when to turn it on, then you video.
          
          Jimmy's puzzled, but he reaches forward and takes the camera,
          shutting it down.
          
                                                          CAMERA ON:
          
          INT. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - UNCLE RODNEY'S TRAILER - DAY
          
          Images of UNCLE RODNEY (50) going in and out of focus as he
          sits on the side of a king sized bed. Scars and tatoos
          litter his arms and neck. His eyes are bit maniacal like
          Charles Manson, but he's able to maintain a stoic, but
          nonetheless dangerous demeanor as Jimmy begins setting up the
          camera.
          
          Like a prison inmate or rabid dog, you get the feeling that
          Uncle Rodney could EXPLODE on you at any second.
          
          Jimmy moves the camera around the room so we briefly see the
          interior of the trailer. It's an ELABORATE triple
          combination of a middle eastern harem, sixties psychedelic
          motif, and white trash/junk-yard memorabilia.
          
          JUST OUT OF FRAME we hear a female voice crying softly,
          whimpering. The voice is close, in the room with us, but we
          can't see who's making the sounds. Uncle Rodney ignores it
          completely.
          
          Camera shakes, indicating that Jimmy is exceptionally
          nervous.
          
                                                                 105.
          
          
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Just one second.
          
                              UNCLE RODNEY
                    Take your time man. I want you to
                    feel comfortable. More
                    importantly, I want you to get this
                    right.
          
          Finally, the camera stops shaking. Jimmy zooms out to a
          medium shot revealing that Uncle Rodney has HAZEL lying next
          to him on the bed with her head on his lap.
          
          Uncle Rodney gently strokes her hair like he's petting a dog.
          Hazel, in the midst of EXTREME withdrawals, cries and
          whimpers like a child, oblivious to Jimmy, the camera, and
          everything else in the world except for Uncle Rodney.
          
          She is so strung out and her cravings are so intense that she
          can barely speak.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    I'm ready whenever you are.
          
          Uncle Rodney looks down upon Hazel.
          
                              UNCLE RODNEY
                    Just a second. I have to take care
                    of my baby.
          
          Uncle Rodney admires his work.
          
                              UNCLE RODNEY
                    She's beautiful isn't she?
          
                              HAZEL
                        (begging, pleading)
                    Please...
          
          Hazel, entrenched in a crystal methamphetamine psychotic
          episode, can only gasp in unintelligible spurts.
          
                              UNCLE RODNEY
                    Some people come here too far gone.
                    Like Hazel here. The only thing I
                    can do for her is ease her pain.
          
          Hazel rolls her body back and forth on the bed, all the while
          keeping her head in Uncle Rodney's lap.
          
                                HAZEL
                    Please...
          
                                                                  106.
          
          
          
                              UNCLE RODNEY
                        (to Hazel)
                    Shhhhh... How about a baby one?
          
          Uncle Rodney's tenderness in dealing with Hazel calms her.
          He's having way too much fun treating her like a baby.
          
                              HAZEL
                    Yes.
          
          Uncle Rodney takes his pinky and dips it into a small plastic
          bag of powder. He then places it to Hazel's nostril.
          
          She quickly snorts the tiny bit off his finger.
          
                              UNCLE RODNEY
                        (to Hazel)
                    There you go...
          
          Hazel begins whimpering again.   It wasn't nearly enough to
          satisfy her.
          
                              UNCLE RODNEY
                    There's something about addiction
                    that brings out something beautiful
                    in a person. Addiction is pure.
                    Addiction reduces a person to an
                    infant. And there's nothing more
                    pure and beautiful in the world
                    than an infant.
          
          He puts his finger to Hazel's nostril again, but this time,
          without any meth on the tip. She snorts with all of her
          might then starts crying. Uncle Rodney is toying with her.
          
                              UNCLE RODNEY
                    Hazel is no longer an adult. She's
                    an infant and I'm the surrogate
                    mother who provides her with much
                    needed breast milk. It's a role
                    that both of us have accepted and
                    embrace.
          
          He leans over and grabs a syringe, already filled, then
          gently holds Hazel's arm and expertly injects the liquid into
          her vein.
          
          Nothing happens for several seconds.
          
          Hazel's breathing accelerates. Suddenly she sits up, her
          eyes go wide. Hazel clinches the bed as if she were riding a
          roller coaster.
          
                                                                    107.
          
          
          
                              UNCLE RODNEY
                        (proudly)
                    That's my girl!
          
          Then, she makes eye contact with Jimmy.
          
          A curious, frightened look comes over her face.   Clearly, she
          recognizes him.
          
          She suddenly JUMPS from the bed and runs out of the room.
          
                              UNCLE RODNEY
                    She's a little jumpy.
          
          Uncle Rodney smiles, amusing himself with his own joke.
          
                              UNCLE RODNEY
                    Let's begin shall we? And
                    please... I'm going to use this
                    tape for my fans, so let's try to
                    get this right.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    OK.
          
                              UNCLE RODNEY
                    I apologize if any of this
                    frightens you or makes you
                    uncomfortable.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    I'll be fine.
          
                              UNCLE RODNEY
                    No. You won't be fine. What I'm
                    going to teach you will be
                    frightening. The truth is an
                    acquired taste but once you get to
                    it, it's all you'll ever want.
          
          Uncle Rodney starts in on his mantra.   It's obvious that he's
          well versed in his meandering rant.
          
                               UNCLE RODNEY
                    Those kids out there... we, the so
                    called "undesirables" - you and me,
                    we know the truth. You know that
                    society doesn't want you, your
                    parents don't want you, corporate
                    America sure as fuck doesn't want
                    you... You wouldn't be here
                    otherwise.

                                                          108.
          
                              UNCLE RODNEY (cont'd)
                    If this government had a choice,
                    they'd gas us all in a heartbeat,
                    exterminate us like the Jews,
                    enslave us like niggers, cuz don't
                    kid yourself, WE ARE the new
                    niggers in this country. No one
                    respects us... No one sees what we
                    have to offer... No one has
                    compassion for us.... They don't
                    care, or they're too naive to see
                    that we're a by-product of a
                    wasteful society that has failed to
                    educate, embrace, influence, or
                    inspire any of us. We're societal
                    garbage. The counter culture no
                    longer exists. It's dead... It's
                    been replaced by us--
          
          Long pause.
          
                              UNCLE RODNEY
                    The garbage culture... thrown
                    aside, imprisoned,
                    institutionalized, systematically
                    abused, executed, and enlisted into
                    wars started by government ass-
                    fuckers just to kill us off. JUST
                    TO KILL US OFF. And every week one
                    of you shows up here,
                    disillusioned, addicted, angry,
                    pissed 'cuz they tossed you
                    aside... into the garbage. Every
                    time someone like you shows up here
                    the garbage culture gets a little
                    bit stronger and they get a little
                    bit weaker. Until the "them" and
                    the "they" of this country run out
                    of places to put us, to put its
                    garbage, and the garbage OVER-FLOWS
                    into their cities from out of the
                    confines of the spaces that they
                    have set aside for us.
          
          A pause, then...
          
                              UNCLE RODNEY
                        (biblical)
                    And we will SET FIRE to their
                    world! And we will burn it, until
                    a living HELL REIGNS over what was
                    their former world, and we will
                    fornicate in their ashes!
          
          Rodney stops, almost out of breath.
          
                                                                   109.
          
          
          
                               UNCLE RODNEY
                     That's what's here for you.   That's
                     what's here...
          
          Rodney settles himself down and takes a few deep breaths as
          Jimmy begins zooming out. Uncle Rodney lights a cigarette to
          calm himself.
          
          Jimmy keeps filming, not knowing whether Rodney is finished
          or just taking a break.
          
          Camera shuts down.
          
                                                            CAMERA ON:
          
          EXT. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - FIRE PIT - NIGHT
          
          Someone (Buddy) is filming a raging party consisting of a lot
          of strung out young white trash junkies just like the ones
          Jimmy was interviewing before. It's certainly a weird bunch.
          They all look alike, dress similar, and have the same type of
          crystal methamphetamine induced facial expressions.
          
          Most of them are smoking weed and drinking forty ounce beers
          while dancing around a campfire and playing the bongo drums.
          They all seem to be having more fun than anyone should be
          allowed.
          
          Camera pans to Jimmy, so we realize that he's not filming.
          Our best guess would be that it's Buddy who's filming. Jimmy
          screams at the camera over the noise of the Bongo drums.
          
                               JIMMY
                     Where's Judy?
          
          Buddy's hand comes into frame as he points by the fire pit.
          We now see Jimmy see Judy.
          
          She dances fervently drinking a forty surrounded by tons of
          other drunk, happily intoxicated teenagers. Say what you
          might about the attendees to the event, this party is a
          FUCKING RAGER and Judy is happy to be the center of
          everyone's attention.
          
          Everyone dances faster and faster as the rhythm of drums beat
          faster and become more intense. It's an all out jam session.
          
          Jimmy heads to the center of the circle of people dancing
          around Judy. Camera follows him with a zoom as he does.
          
          JUMP CUT
          
                                                                    110.
          
          
          
          Who knows how much later. Minutes or hours, the party rages
          forward. The camera spins around. The party has reached a
          new level of drunken absurdity. Most of those who are
          dancing are drunk, stoned or both.
          
          In the background, while it's too dark and hectic see
          anything explicit, some of the teenagers are engaged in a
          variety of sexual activity. Some have threesomes. Some are
          probably having oral sex. Still others dance around them in
          the foreground.
          
          Camera zooms in on Uncle Rodney.
          
          Standing just behind him, we see of flash of someone
          recognizable. It's a skinny woman, she looks vaguely
          familiar, but it's hard to get a fix with all the craziness
          going on.
          
          She turns her head to look over at Rodney.
          
          Now we can clearly see that this person is...
          
          HAZEL - with her eyes wide and clearly in the height of
          rolling on crank.
          
          AND she's saying something to Uncle Rodney that's definitely
          pissing him off.
          
          Bodies wipe the frame.
          
          JUMP CUT
          
          Moments later. Camera catches Judy who hasn't missed a step
          along the way to being a high, drunken mess. The rhythm of
          the drum beats is ever present.
          
          Uncle Rodney comes up behind her and wraps his arms around
          her shoulder, saying something to her, but we can't hear it
          over the noise. Jimmy approaches and they start talking.
          
          Jimmy doesn't notice, but there are about four or five of the
          kids, especially a couple of Rodney's Bigger Guys standing
          not too far behind Uncle Rodney watching the conversation
          intensely.
          
          It's really difficult to put your finger on it exactly, but
          something doesn't seem right here.
          
          Uncle Rodney lets go of Judy and puts his arm around Jimmy.
          With the noise of the drums and the fact that we're zoomed in
          from a distance, we can't hear anything they're saying.
          
                                                                 111.
          
          
          
          Now Uncle Rodney and Jimmy are having a conversation as they
          move towards the camera. Though Jimmy can't see it, we can
          see that Rodney's Bigger Guys, the ones that were standing
          behind Uncle Rodney are now pushing Judy along behind Jimmy
          and Rodney. Though Uncle Rodney seems to be having a very
          light and friendly conversation with Jimmy, we continue to
          get the feeling that something ominous is afoot.
          
          Finally, they approach camera and we can hear them.
          
                               UNCLE RODNEY
                     I'm so glad you guys came down
                     here. We never would have guessed
                     you'd come and see us.
          
                               JIMMY
                     You've been awesome.   Judy loves it
                     here.
          
          Uncle Rodney's got Jimmy in an incredibly friendly one armed
          side hug.
          
                               UNCLE RODNEY
                     I knew she would. By the way.
          
          Rodney's face drops.
          
                               UNCLE RODNEY
                     I know what you did to Dinko.
          
          This hits Jimmy like a lead weight. Before he can react at
          all, and before he realizes that anything is happening, Jimmy
          is suddenly thrown into a headlock by Uncle Rodney.
          
          Off camera, something similar is happening to Judy.
          
                               JUDY (O.C.)
                         (screaming)
                     What the fuck are you doing?!
                     Jimmy, Jimmy!
          
          Judy screams his name over and over.
          
                                JUDY
                     Jimmy!   Jimmy!
          
                               BUDDY (O.C.)
                         (laughing)
                     Shut it, bitch!
          
          SMACK!   Judy's been hit by Buddy off screen.
          
                                                                  112.
          
          
          
          Camera shuts down.
          
                                                           CAMERA ON:
          
          EXT. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - DARK WOODS - NIGHT
          
          We hear intense struggling and laughter. By the sounds we
          hear, we gather that Jimmy and Judy are being dragged off
          into the woods against their will by Buddy and Rodney's
          Bigger Guys, but it's too dark to tell if that is what in
          fact is happening.
          
          Someone unidentified is running the show and operates the
          camera. It's impossible to see, but it's definitely Buddy's
          voice.
          
                              BUDDY (O.C.)
                    Here, here, here. Right here.
          
          Judy is screaming and crying.
          
                               JUDY (O.C.)
                    Jimmy!
          
                               JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Judy?
          
          Two or three guys, it's too dark to tell, start laughing.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                        (screams)
                    Please somebody help us!
          
          Jimmy grunts, trying to break free.
          
                               JIMMY
                    Judy!
          
                              RODNEY'S BIG GUY #1 (O.C.)
                    Shut up, asshole! You wanna
                    fucking talk!
          
          MUNCH. Somewhere in the darkness Jimmy's been kicked in the
          gut. The camera hits the ground. It lands right in front of
          Jimmy. We can still barely see what's going on, but we're
          close enough and there's enough flashes of light from
          flashlights to see that Jimmy is face down and bloody.
          
                              JIMMY
                        (defiant)
                    Fuck you!
          
                                                                  113.
          
          
          
          Jimmy gets kicked again just once. Then suddenly, a barrage
          of kicks come at Jimmy one after the other after the other.
          
          Leaves and grass and dirt and flying feet shoot at Jimmy's
          face as he is kicked and beaten repeatedly.
          
          The process goes on for about thirty excruciating seconds.
          
          We can't tell how much damage has been sustained, but Jimmy's
          not moving. He's either unconscious or dead.
          
          With one last kick, the camera is knocked aside and we don't
          see Jimmy's face anymore.
          
                              RODNEY'S BIG GUY #1 (O.C.)
                    Is he fucking dead?
          
                               JUDY (O.C.)
                    Jimmy!   Jimmy say something!
          
          They mock her in a high pitched wining voice.
          
                              BUDDY (O.C.)
                        (mocking)
                    Jimmy. Jimmy say something.
          
                              RODNEY'S BIG GUY #2 (O.C.)
                    Get her clothes off.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                        (screaming)
                    Noooooo! Noooooo!
          
          Judy screams at the top of her lungs over and over again as
          we hear them tearing at her clothes. Then they pick her up
          and start pulling her away from camera.
          
          Her screams get quieter and quieter... fainter and fainter.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                        (extremely faint)
                    Jimmy!
          
          Finally there's silence. The camera isn't moving.    It's on
          the ground and in the dark. Camera shuts down.
          
                                                           CAMERA ON:
          
          EXT. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - PARKING AREA - DINKO'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          It's completely pitch black dark. We can see nothing.    We
          can only hear the sound of Jimmy fumbling around and
          breathing heavily and nervously.
          
                                                                   114.
          
          
          
          BEGIN NITE SHOT
          
          Suddenly, we see everything, albeit in a weird black and
          white grainy fashion. Jimmy's flipped the camera into Nite
          Shot, using the fuzzy black and white mode as a tool to see
          in the complete darkness. He's strapped the camera to his
          wrist.
          
          The image is Jimmy's POV as he searches through his trunk for
          something. Pulling aside a duffle bag, we see the 9mm pistol
          that Jimmy stole from the Cop. He grabs it as camera shuts
          down.
          
                                                         CAMERA ON:
          
          I/E. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - FIRE PIT/OUTSIDE RODNEY'S
          TRAIER/INSIDE RODNEYS TRAILER/PARKING AREA/DINKO'S CAR -
          NIGHT
          
          By the fire pit, the site where the teenage drunken of orgy
          took place, the bonfire has been put out and there are dozens
          of drunken/passed out teenagers lying on the ground in
          sleeping bags and in tents.
          
          Jimmy begins looking for Judy with his night vision camera.
          
          He sees a girl lying on the ground in a sleeping bag   with her
          back turned to the camera. Her hair is identical to    Judy's,
          but we can't see her face. Jimmy quietly steps over    passed
          out teenagers, being extremely careful not to awaken   anyone.
          
          Jimmy accidently kicks a forty ounce beer bottle that causes
          a loud clanking sound of glass on glass.
          
          Jimmy stops in his tracks in anticipation of someone waking
          up. No one does.
          
          Jimmy continues to walk towards the GIRL WHO LOOKS LIKE JUDY.
          
          Kneeling directly in front of her, Jimmy puts his hands on
          her shoulder and pulls the girl's front region towards the
          camera. The girl flips over.
          
          It's not Judy. And luckily, the girl is so severely
          intoxicated that she doesn't wake up.
          
          Jimmy now makes his way over to a tent. He quietly unzips
          the mesh entrance and extends his arm out to video tape the
          inside. Turns out, the person in the tent is just another
          passed out flunky loser. Jimmy quickly takes his arm out of
          the tent.
          
                                                                    115.
          
          
          
          Jimmy gives it one last go and continues to look for Judy
          among the sea of passed out bodies lying on the ground.
          
          No luck.
          
          Jimmy's not too far from Uncle Rodney's trailer.   He decides
          to make his way up.
          
          He walks, using his Nite Shot to see, through the sea of
          bodies until he gets up to the entrance...
          
          OUTSIDE RODNEY'S TRAILER
          
          There's a cracked glass door leaning up against the woodpile
          by the entrance. Jimmy steps around it, turning the lens at
          the glass. He briefly catches his reflection. He looks like
          hell warmed over, freshly bruised and cut from the recent
          beating.
          
          Moving forward, Jimmy makes it to the front door of Uncle
          Rodney's trailer. We hear music coming from inside. Very
          slowly and very carefully, Jimmy cracks the front door.
          
          INSIDE RODNEY'S TRAILER
          
          It's even darker inside of the trailer, but Jimmy presses
          forward in spite of that fact, still using his Nite Shot to
          see. A boom box sits by the bed, still on, playing music.
          
          Jimmy is scared shitless.
          
          In the corner of the room, in a make shift bunk, is Uncle
          Rodney sleeping with his arms wrapped around a girl in a
          spooning position. There's no doubt this time.
          
          It's definitely JUDY!
          
          They are both sound asleep and actually look very cozy lying
          together. Jimmy slowly walks over towards them. Each step
          is slower and slower, being extra careful not to wake them.
          
          Once Jimmy is within arm's length of the two of them he
          stops. He hesitates for a moment. He hasn't prepared
          himself for this particular situation and doesn't know
          exactly what to do.
          
          He continues filming them until he finally musters the
          courage to extend his non-filming arm out to tap Judy on the
          face. Judy remains unconscious/sleeping as Jimmy gently taps
          the side of her cheek. Jimmy slowly begins tapping harder
          and harder until the tap evolves into a poke. Still nothing.
          
                                                                    116.
          
          
          
          THWACK! An arm comes out of nowhere and grabs Jimmy's poking
          hand. Jimmy has woken up Uncle Rodney!
          
          The camera shakes out of control.   Uncle Rodney screams at
          the top of his lungs:
          
                              UNCLE RODNEY
                    Who the fuck...!
          
          Intense and furious wrestling ensues as Uncle Rodney flies
          out of frame then, in a split second:
          
          BAM!
          
          A gunshot goes off. We hear a Uncle Rodney collapse,
          followed by more gun shots. The camera has fallen from
          Jimmy's hand and dangles by the wrist strap. Camera comes to
          rest on...
          
          UNCLE RODNEY'S BLOODY FACE
          
          Jimmy's shot and killed him.
          
          Outside, footsteps hit the deck.    Buddy opens the door of the
          trailer.
          
                              BUDDY
                    Hey!
          
          BAM, BAM, BAM!
          
          Three more rounds are fired, hitting Buddy square in the
          chest, knocking him down. Jimmy points the camera at a dead
          Buddy on his back then whip pans it back to Judy in the bed.
          Finally we hear Jimmy speak.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Judy, Judy, wake up. Fucking wake
                    up!
          
          Outside we hear voices of some of Rodney's Other Teens.
          
          Jimmy acts fast. Judy has been drugged and is mostly
          unconscious and groggy, but Jimmy picks her up and gets her
          on her feet, shouldering her out the door. Shot continues
          to...
          
          OUTSIDE RODNEY'S TRAILER
          
          We hear faint voices...
          
                                                                   117.
          
          
          
                               RODNEY'S BIG GUY #3
                         (faint)
                     Hey! Hey!
          
          A DISTANT GUNSHOT FIRES, but we can't see what is going on.
          It's too dark and the camera is too shaky as they go to...
          
          PARKING AREA
          
          Another DISTANT SHOT, then Jimmy gasps in pain. He's been
          shot, but decides to run, trying to carry a groggy Judy
          anyway. Their car is in sight as we hear guns going off and
          bullets whizzing by them. One hits Dinko's car.
          
          Jimmy opens the door, then places the passed out Judy and the
          camera in the passenger seat, climbs over her, throwing the
          camera into Judy's lap.
          
          We see him scramble to get the key in the ignition as we hear
          a BULLET HIT the driver's door. The car starts, and Jimmy
          throws it into gear, flooring the gas as he speeds away.
          
                                JIMMY
                     Judy?   Judy?
          
          Nothing.
          
                               JIMMY
                     Judy wake up.
          
          Jimmy's voice begins to crack as he talks to/tries to wake up
          Judy.
          
                               JIMMY (O.C.)
                     Are you all right baby?   Please
                     wake up Judy. Judy?
          
          We don't know if Judy is dead or alive.
          
          Jimmy swerves to avoid something in the road sending the
          camera to the floor as camera shuts down.
          
                                                            CAMERA ON:
          
          INT. ROAD TO BORDER MOTEL - CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - DAY
          
          Close on Judy. The afternoon light strikes a shadow across
          her face. Her hair's a mess. No makeup.
          
                               JIMMY (O.C.)
                     Judy, sweetie. Come on honey.      I
                     saw you waking up.
          
                                                                   118.
          
          
          
          Judy's eyes flutter.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    There ya go.
          
          Judy opens her eyes.    She smiles when she sees Jimmy behind
          the lens.
          
                                 JUDY
                    Hi, baby.
          
                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                    You okay?
          
                              JUDY
                    Am I with you?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    You're with me.
          
          She smiles wider.
          
                              JUDY
                    Then I'm okay.
          
          Camera shuts down.
          
                                                           CAMERA ON:
          
          I/E. HIGHWAY TO BORDER/DINKO'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          Judy's got the camera trained on herself.    She talks like a
          child.
          
                              JUDY
                    Mexicooooooh....
          
          Judy points the camera up at Jimmy. This is the first time
          we've seen him at all since he was beaten up by Uncle
          Rodney's group. He's a wreck. His face is puffy. His lip
          is cut up. His eye is swollen. He looks like a flyweight
          boxer who just went fifteen rounds with a heavyweight.
          
          He drives with one arm because the other one is in a bandage.
          
                                 JUDY (O.C.)
                    Hey baby.
          
          Jimmy looks like a beaten man, both physically and
          emotionally. His bad ass attitude and rebellious charisma
          are seemingly non-existent.
          
                                                                 119.
          
          
          
          For the first time, we are seeing Jimmy without his armor.
          He looks like any other 21 year old kid who is down,
          vulnerable, and confused. Not to mention the fact that he
          has a fucking bullet lodged in his shoulder.
          
                                 JUDY (O.C.)
                    Baby?
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Come on.     Not the camera.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Nooooo. It reminds me of when we
                    first met. Just you, me, and the
                    camera. God, do you remember how
                    you used to freak me out?
          
                              JIMMY
                    Yeah, those were the good old days.
                    How much money do we have?
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    I don't know, why?
          
                              JIMMY
                    How do you feel about Canada?   It's
                    closer.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Are we going together?
          
          Jimmy looks over at her.
          
                              JIMMY
                    I think I should take you home.
          
          Judy doesn't answer.
          
                              JIMMY
                    I could write you a letter. Or I
                    could make a video saying I made
                    you do everything. They'd believe
                    you. You could tell them it was
                    all my fault. You could tell them
                    I was going to Mexico and I'd
                    really go to Canada.
          
          Jimmy swallows.
          
                              JIMMY
                    We swore on the bond we'd never be
                    apart... but...
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                 120.
          
                              JIMMY (cont'd)
                    I'll let you out of it... If you
                    want to be out of it, I'll let you
                    out.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    You're never leaving me, and I'm
                    never leaving you. That's all
                    there is to it.
          
                               JIMMY
                    Okay.
          
          Judy leans in and kisses him.
          
                               JIMMY
                    Owww.
          
          Judy comes back into the passenger seat and just films him.
          She likes looking at him through the lens.
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    You're so handsome, you know that?
          
          Jimmy smiles as best he can with his face all messed up.
          Then his eyes get droopy and close.
          
          He's not responding. He's as punch drunk as you can get.
          
                               JUDY (O.C.)
                    Jimmy?
          
          Jimmy's obviously in a concussion induced daze. The car
          starts to drift. Judy drops the camera on the seat as we
          hear her leap forward to take control of the car.
          
                               JUDY (O.C.)
                    Jimmy!
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                        (snaps to)
                    What?
          
                              JUDY (O.C.)
                    Jimmy, stop the car. You're too
                    fucked up to drive.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                        (groggy)
                    Huh? Oh... okay.
          
          Camera shuts down.
          
                                                         CAMERA ON:
          
                                                                121.
          
          
          
          I/E. HIGHWAY FINAL-SCENE/DINKO'S CAR - DAY
          
          Judy drives.   There isn't much talking going on.
          
                              JUDY
                    You wanted to ask me something?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Do you love me?
          
                              JUDY
                    You know I do.
          
                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                    I do.
          
          The car drives. Judy just cruises along, music playing on
          the radio. Jimmy (O.C.) looks in the mirror but keeps the
          camera trained on her.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    You know I love you, right?
          
                                 JUDY
                    Yup.
          
                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Judy?
          
                                 JUDY
                    Yes?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    We're fucked.
          
                              JUDY
                    What do you mean?
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Look in the rearview mirror.
          
          Judy looks up immediately.    Her face drops.
          
          Jimmy flips the camera around out the back window. There's a
          Ohio State Trooper with its lights flashing tailing them. A
          lone trooper is on his radio.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    That's it baby. We're done.
          
          Judy doesn't answer.    She's short circuited.
          
                                                                  122.
          
          
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Just pull over. It's not worth it.
          
          Judy holds still for a second, not saying a word.
          
          The cop car CHIRPS its siren.
          
          Judy looks up.
          
                               JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Judy, what are you doing?      You know
                    this is...
          
                              JUDY
                    Don't do this.
          
          Judy looks up into the rearview mirror. Her eyes are welling
          up. She looks out the front windshield.
          
          Jimmy senses that she sees something. He flips the camera
          around through the front only to see a row of cop cars
          blocking the highway up ahead.
          
          He flips the camera back at her.
          
                                    JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Judy?
          
                              JUDY
                        (freaks)
                    Shut up!
          
          Judy looks straight ahead, determination on her face.
          
          She won't answer.    Then...
          
          She turns the wheel hard to the right, almost carrying Jimmy
          into her, and takes the car onto a side road.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    I love you.
          
                              JUDY
                    I love you too.
          
          Judy is on her own mission.
          
                                    JIMMY (O.C.)
                    It's over.
          
                                    JUDY
                           (soft)
                    No.
          
                                                                   123.
          
          
          
                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                    It is.
          
                                 JUDY
                    No.
          
          The car stops short. Jimmy turns the camera to point out the
          windshield. They're stuck. The road has come to a dead end.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    It's a dead end.
          
          Judy ignores Jimmy. She throws the car into reverse and
          tries to turn it around and head back the way she came.
          
          A faint sound of a helicopter fades up slowly from the
          background.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Do you hear that?
          
          Judy doesn't respond.    She's determined.
          
                                JUDY
                          (lying)
                    No.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Come on, it's over. I'll do what I
                    said before. I'll tell them I made
                    you do it. It'll be okay.
          
                               JUDY
                    No.   I want us to be together.
          
                               JIMMY (O.C.)
                        (screams)
                    Well we fucking can't, so pull the
                    fuck over!
          
                              JUDY
                    Yes we can. I won't give you up.
                    I won't let you go. No way.
          
          Jimmy pans the camera out the front windshield. In the
          distance, we catch sight of a road block that's been set up
          at the end of the dirt trail. They're screwed. There's
          nowhere to go.
          
                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Come on.
          
          Judy doesn't answer.
          
                                                                    124.
          
          
          
                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Judy?
          
          She still doesn't answer.
          
          Then the car thrusts itself forward.
          
                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Judy!     Stop it.
          
          Judy's got a look of determination in her eye.
          
                              JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Judy, what are you doing?
          
          Judy doesn't respond. O.C., she's murmuring something to
          herself that Jimmy can't hear or understand while she has the
          throttle to the floor as they barrel toward the roadblock.
          
                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Judy!
          
          Judy keeps going.    Jimmy flips the back camera towards her.
          
                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Judy!     Stop!
          
          Judy's murmurs grow louder.
          
                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                    Judy!
          
          Jimmy braces himself as the car continues toward the
          roadblock.
          
          Suddenly, Judy's murmurs get loud enough or us to hear.
          
                              JUDY
                        (murmurs)
                    We'll be together. We'll be
                    together. We'll be together.
                    We'll be together...
          
          They head straight in between two cars that form the
          roadblock. Cops jump out of the way as the car hits head on
          into...
          
          THE ROADBLOCK
          
          Impact sends the camera flying against the windshield,
          CRACKING IT.
          
                                                                   125.
          
          
          
          Sounds of metal twisting and glass shattering is all
          encompassing as the camera shakes in a violent frenzy!
          
          Camera settles on Judy's face, bloody, unconscious against
          the steering wheel, her neck snapped, eyes open in a death
          stare.
          
          Camera stays focussed on Judy for the longest time as she
          leans against the steering wheel. Music plays on the radio.
          It's JOHNNY CASH's cover of Tom Petty's "I won't Back Down".
          
          OVERHEAD SHOT of a news helicopter flying above the final
          scene.
          
          Looking down from above, we see what the helicopter sees:
          
          A scene of about twelve State Trooper cars, lights flashing,
          with Jimmy and Judy's car wrecked. Ambulances are there.
          Jimmy and Judy's lifeless bodies are pulled from their car as
          Johnny Cash's song shifts from background to score.
          
          The helicopter continues its circular pattern as the song
          continues and we...
          
                                                     FADE TO BLACK.
