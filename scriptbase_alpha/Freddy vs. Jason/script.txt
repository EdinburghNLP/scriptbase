          NIGHTMARE 13 -- FREDDY MEETS JASON

                    by Lewis Abernathy


     FADE IN:

     EXT. ELM STREET - DAY

     MEAGAN is coming down the sidewalk in slow motion.
     Her dress and long hair blow slightly in the breeze.
     The SOUND of CHILDREN CHANTING increases.

                    DREAM CHILDREN
               (in chorus)
          One... two... Freddy's coming for
          you.

     On "you" there is a RUMBLE and a flash -- like quick
     lightning only evil.  (Choice flashes from Nightmare on
     Elm Street 1 & 2).

     Meagan turns at 1665.  A beautiful white, two-story
     house, thick with lush green foliage.  Several beautiful
     children, all dressed in bright white, play hopscotch
     and jumprope on the front walk.

                    DREAM CHILDREN
               (continuing; chanting)
          Three... four... better lock your
          door.

     Close on a little girl's foot coming down on the number
     "4" drawn on concrete.

     Another RUMBLE and flash -- longer, LOUDER.  (Flashes
     from Nightmare 3 & 4).

     Meagan continues up the walk, the wind is blowing a
     little harder now.  The trees are brown, the leaves
     peeling away.

     Moving up the walk, closer to the house... only now
     it's a little darker, needs some paint.  On the front
     porch, a LITTLE GIRL rides a tricycle.

                    DREAM CHILDREN
               (continuing; chanting)
          Five... six...

     RUMBLE.  Flash.  (Nightmare 5 and Freddy's Dead).

                    DREAM CHILDREN
               (continuing; chanting)
          ...grab your crucifix.. ix.. ix..

     The "ix" echoes away, becoming the faint "Ka ka ka"
     we all recognize as Jason's theme.  Meagan turns to
     find that the children in the yard have vanished. It's
     nighttime.

     The trees are dead, the grass is gone, and the horizon
     stretches off into utter nothingness.  Meagan turns
     back to the little girl.

     But the little girl has gone.  Only the tricycle
     remains.  It circles once, the front door CREAKS open,
     and the empty tricycle peddles inside.  Meagan follows
     it into the...


     INT. HOUSE ON ELM STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Meagan enters the house slowly, watching as the tri-
     cycle rides off down a creepy hallway and disappears.
     Then the front door blows shut behind Meagan.  She
     tries to open it -- locked.

     Then faint VOICES cause Meagan to pause.  She listens,
     trying to make out the low murmur.  Then a little girl's
     GIGGLE.  Meagan recognizes it as her sister's.

                    MEAGAN
          Lizzy?

     Meagan moves up the stairs, going down the hall...
     following the voices (we recognize the other voice as
     belonging to Freddy).  Meagan enters a door at the
     end of the hallway, moving into...


     INT. LIZZY'S ROOM (NIGHTMARE) - CONTINOUS ACTION

     On the floor, near her bed, is Meagan's thirteen year
     old sister -- LIZZY.  Slow for her age, Lizzy sits and
     draws with crayons.

                    MEAGAN
          Lizzy. What are you doing here?

                    LIZZY
          Playing with my friend.

     Meagan looks at the drawings -- childlike renderings
     of Freddy.

                    MEAGAN
          Your friend?

                    LIZZY
          He lives under the bed.

     Meagan slowly gets to her knees and takes a peek under
     Lizzy's bed.

     Suddenly, a doll-sized Freddy scurries out from under
     the bed, flashing past Meagan's face and running out
     the door.  Meagan yelps and touches her face -- five
     tiny slash marks on her cheek.  Lizzy clucks.

                    LIZZY
               (continuing)
          You scared him...

     Meagan looks out the door, incredulous.

                    MEAGAN
          I scared him?

     But when Meagan looks back, Lizzy is gone.

                    MEAGAN
               (continuing)
          Lizzy?

     Lizzy echoes away as Meagan finds herself standing
     in the...


     INT. NIGHTMARE CHAPEL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     The tiny Freddy dashes from the pews and jumps into
     a casket at the altar, slamming the lid shut.  Meagan
     goes to the casket and carefully opens the lid.  Inside
     -- a rotting corpse with worms and maggots crawling
     all over it.  Meagan screams and slams the lid back
     down.

     The casket starts to move -- THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!
     Then it stops.  Tentatively, Meagan opens the lid again.

     Inside -- FREDDY KRUEGER.  He grabs her arm.

                    FREDDY
          Where ya been all my death, baby?

     Meagan screams.  Freddy leaps out of the casket in a
     tuxedo, crooning:

                    FREDDY
               (continuing)
          I've been waitin' at the altar for
          a long, long time!

     Meagan looks down -- she's wearing a wedding dress,
     spattered with blood.  Behind her, the chapel has
     filled with dozens of DEAD PEOPLE in various stages
     of decay.  A SATANIC PRIEST appears in the pulpit and
     asks:

                    SATANIC PRIEST
          Are the bridesmaids in attendance?

     Meagan looks to her left -- four girls hold bouquets,
     dressed in body bags.

                    SATANIC PRIEST
               (continuing)
          And the groomsmen...?

     Freddy opens his tuxedo jacket to reveal several
     trapped souls struggling to get out of his chest.

                    SATANIC PRIEST
               (continuing)
          If anyone here believes that these
          two should not be joined in unholy
          matrimony, let him speak now or
          forever rot in hell...

     >From the back of the chapel, a voice:

                    JESSE
          Meagan!

     Meagan turns.  It's her boyfriend -- JESSE.  He stands
     in the chapel doorway, backlit by bright light, arms
     outstretched.

                    MEAGAN
          Jesse!

     Meagan runs to Jesse and grabs him, their arms
     encircling one another.  She looks up into Jesse's
     eyes... only it isn't Jesse.

     It's Jason.

     Meagan screams as Jason raises his machete, bringing
     it down between her eyes...

                              TRANSITION CUT TO:

     INT. MEAGAN'S ROOM - MORNING

     Meagan opens an eye as her alarm clock BUZZES... she
     was dreaming.  She gets up quickly and crosses to her
     dresser.  She looks into the mirror, at the tiny cuts
     on her cheek, and clucks.  Then she exits, going into...


     INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Meagan opens the door to her sister's room, breathing
     a sigh of relief when she sees Lizzy curled up in bed
     with a doll.  Meagan smiles and starts to exit when
     she notices something not quite right about the doll.
     She moves closer and pulls Lizzy's arm away to reveal
     a hideous little Freddy doll.  Meagan gasps.

                    MEAGAN
          Freddy...

     Suddenly, the doll opens it's eyes and sneers:

                    FREDDY DOLL
          Well it ain't Raggedy Ann, bitch!

     The Freddy doll flashes it's tiny glove of knives,
     thrusting them deep into Meagan's chest.

                         HARD CUT TO:

     INT. MEAGAN'S ROOM - MORNING (for real)

     Meagan sits up suddenly in bed, clutching her chest.
     She looks down and sees that there is nothing there.
     Meagan sighs and falls back in her bed -- just a bad
     dream.

     ZZZZZZT! -- her alarm clock BUZZES.  Meagan sits up
     with a start again.  Her fright turns to rage as she
     pounds the alarm clock into submission.  Meagan climbs
     out of bed...


     INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - MORNING

     Meagan enters and finds Lizzy still asleep, clutching
     her Raggedy Ann doll.  She gently pries the doll away,
     tossing it disdainfully away.  Meagan picks up a small
     glass unicorn and playfully prances it around on Lizzy's
     head.

                    MEAGAN
          Wake up, sleepy head. Time to wake
          up.

     Lizzy's eyes flutter open.  She smiles at her sister,
     then frowns.

                    LIZZY
          I had a bad dream.

                    MEAGAN
          Me, too.

                    LIZZY
          I was scared.

                    MEAGAN
          Don't worry... they can't hurt you.

                    LIZZY
          Promise?

                    MEAGAN
          Promise.

     Lizzy hugs Meagan.

                    MEAGAN
               (continuing)
          I'll never let anyone hurt you.


     INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

     CLOSE ON a small television set on the kitchen table.
     A flashy graphic flashes across the screen: AM NEWS
     SPECIAL REPORT -- COPS V.S. THE CULT -- DAY 13.  A
     NEWS REPORTER stands in front a police blockade. In
     the background, dozens of POLICE and S.W.A.T. MEN
     surround a small run-down, two-story house... Freddy's
     house.

                    NEWS REPORTER
               (filtered)
          As the sun rises on yet another
          morning, still no end in sight for
          the standoff between police and the
          mysterious group known only as the
          "Freddy" cult who seized the abandoned
          house behind me just thirteen days
          ago.  These cultists -- mostly run-
          away teenagers -- have managed to
          keep police at bay for almost two
          weeks while inside they take mind-
          altering narcotics in order to
          communicate with their god --
          Freddy.

     The reporter babbles on as Meagan enters the kitchen
     where MEAGAN'S MOM is sitting watching the TV, gulping
     down orange juice.  Across from mom is MEAGAN'S DAD,
     who is having coffee, reading the paper.  Meagan pours
     herself a cup and sits.

                    MEAGAN
          Morning.

     Meagan's mom grunts, transfixed on the news.  Dad
     looks over his paper long enough to smile and say,
     just a little too cheerfully:

                    MEAGAN'S DAD
          Morning, Meagan.

     Meagan looks over at her mother, then back at her
     father, mouthing the words "How's mom?", when suddenly
     Meagan's mom bellows:

                    MEAGAN'S MOM
               (calls upstairs)
          Lizzy! Get down here! Breakfast
          is almost ready!

     Meagan turns back to her dad but he has ducked back
     into his paper.  Meagan sighs and sips her coffee.

     ANGLE ON TV -- a police booking photo of FRED KRUEGER.

                    NEWS REPORTER
          Alleged child murderer Fred Krueger
          was released on a legal technicality
          but later burned to death at the
          hands of a vigilante mob of grieving
          parents.  Some years later, a rash
          of bizarre and unexplainable teen-
          age deaths began leaving many in
          the area to wonder... is Freddy
          really dead?

     Meagan's younger sister -- LIZZY -- comes down to
     breakfast.  The microwave DINGS and Meagan's mom
     pulls out three Pop Tarts, dealing them out to her
     family like playing cards.  Lizzy picks up her Pop
     Tart, whining.

                    MEAGAN'S MOM
          Hurry up and eat. You don't want
          to be late for special school.

                    MEAGAN
          Mom! Don't call it that!

                    LIZZY
          I hate that school. The other kids
          are mean... and they're all re-
          tard-ed!

     Meagan snickers.

                    MEAGAN'S MOM
          We don't use that word. They're
          "special" children just like you're
          "special".

     Dad looks over at mom, who shoots him an angry look.
     Dad takes a bite of his Pop Tart, sinking back behind
     the paper.

     ANGLE ON TV --

                    NEWS REPORTER
          The cult members have declined to
          an on-camera interview but did send
          out a note with a message. The note
          -- which, by the way, appears to
          have been written in blood -- reads...
               (reads the note)
          To the parents of Springwood --
          Freddy lives! Soon he will come and
          take one of your children as his
          virgin bride. Then Freddy will -BEEP-
          and his -BEEP- upon her -BEEP- and
          -BEEP- and behold, a soulless child
          shall be born. The vessel for Freddy
          to rise and rule the darkness forever
          and ever.

     A horn TOOTS outside.

                    MEAGAN
          That's Jesse. Let's go, Lizzy.

     Meagan collects her books and her sister. This is
     dad's cue to look at his watch and say:

                    MEAGAN'S DAD
          Oh, look at the time! I've got to
          be going... anyone need me to bring
          anything home tonight?

                    MEAGAN
          I need an alarm clock.

                    MEAGAN'S DAD
          What's wrong with your old one?

                    MEAGAN
          Broke.

     Meagan kisses her dad as she and Lizzy hurry out the
     door.  Meagan's dad looks over at his wife, who says:

                    MEAGAN'S MOM
          We're almost out of vodka.


     EXT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - MORNING - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Meagan and Lizzy climb into JESSE's car.

                    JESSE
          Good morning! Hey, what's the matter?

                    MEAGAN
          My mom...

                    JESSE
          And...?

                    MEAGAN
          I had another dream last night...

                    JESSE
          Was I naked?

                    MEAGAN
          No. You were Jason.

                    JESSE
          Jason? Oh, yeech...
               (then)
          Was I any good?

     Meagan playfully smacks him as Jesse's car ROARS off.


     INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

     Meagan's dad hesitates at the front door, clutching
     his keys and briefcase as he musters the courage to
     say something.

                    MEAGAN'S DAD
          Do you have to watch that crap all
          the time? Months and months of the
          O.J. Simpson trial, and now this...

     Mom reaches over and switches off the TV. Dad smiles
     slightly and exits. Mom waits until the door closes,
     then takes a bottle of vodka and pours a goodly bit
     into her orange juice.  She takes a deep drink and
     switches the set back on.

     CLOSE ON TV as the news reporter interviews CAPTAIN
     RENTON MURDOCH -- State Trooper.

                    NEWS REPORTER
          I'm standing here with State Trooper
          Captain Renton Murdoch, the man the
          Governor has called in to deal with
          the cultists because of his past
          experience with occult-style
          murderers. In fact, Trooper Murdoch
          is the only law enforcement officer
          ever to survive a one-on-one encounter
          with notorious Camp Crystal Lake
          killer -- Jason Voorhees.
               (to Murdoch)
          You received some pretty nasty
          injuries in your battle with Jason,
          didn't you, Captain?

                    MURDOCH
          Nothing serious... just a few
          stitches.

                    NEWS REPORTER
          What about these so called "Freddy"
          cultists? They seem like pretty
          tough customers. Think you'll have
          any trouble getting them out of
          there?

                    MURDOCH
          No. Now that the Governor has given
          me complete authority to deal with
          these punks I should be putting an
          end to their situation pretty quick.
          Unless of course their attorney is
          able to get them to come out peace-
          fully... but I don't hold out much
          hope for that.

                    NEWS REPORTER
               (to camera)
          Captain Renton Murdoch, ladies and
          gentlemen. A tough cop... for tough
          criminals.

                            CUT TO:

     EXT. "FREDDY" CULT COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER

     Murdoch gets into the command car, sitting down next
     to the S.W.A.T. COMMANDER sitting behind the wheel.

                    MURDOCH
          Damn media... oughtta be a law.
               (gestures to house)
          Is that shyster still in there
          trying to talk them out?

                    S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
          Yeah... he's making them some kind
          of deal.

                    MURDOCH
          Damn lawyers... what a bunch of
          assholes. Shakespeare was right --
          kill all the lawyers. Then we could
          kill all the punks with no hassles
          and the world would be a safer place.

                    S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
          Smaller anyway.

                    MURDOCH
          Ahhhhh... what did Shakespeare know?
          Long-haired, English freak. He was
          probably a punk.


     INT. CULT COMPOUND - SAME TIME

     Meanwhile, inside the house... the cult's sleazy LAWYER
     is sitting on a crate in the middle of a dark room.
     He is surrounded by CULTISTS -- heavily-armed teenage
     punks in red and olive sweaters and Fedoras ala Freddy.
     They stare out at him through sunglasses with red
     flashing diodes that barely hide their burned and
     disfigured faces.

     The lawyer shifts uncomfortably on the crate as he
     takes a deep snort from inside his briefcase held
     neatly on his lap.  Then he lifts his head, wiping
     his nose nervously as he speaks:

                    SLEAZY LAWYER
          So, as I explained to you before,
          the revenues between the TV movie
          deal and the book sale should be
          adequate to fund your joint-defense.
          And I think with my mass media
          hypnosis argument I could get each
          of you a reduced sentence on appeal
          -- say... twenty years each. Out
          in fifteen with good behavior?
          Hmmmmm?

                         HARD CUT TO:

     EXT. CULT COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER

     The lawyer's disembodied head comes sailing out of
     an upstairs window, smacking into the command car's
     windshield with a loud SPLAT!

                    S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
          Jesus Christ!

     Murdoch curses and leaps out of the car, charging
     the house as he BLASTS away with two nickel-plated
     .45s.  Suddenly GUNFIRE erupts from every window in
     the house, BULLET HITS RIDDLING the cops cars,
     SMASHING windows and emergency lights.

     The S.W.A.T. TEAM follows Murdoch through the hail
     of GUNFIRE as he kicks open the front door.


     INT. CULT COMPOUND - NEXT INSTANT

     WHACK! -- the door flies open and Murdoch and the
     S.W.A.T. team move in.  The windows have been covered
     with foil, the walls have been painted black with
     cult slogans written in red, making the whole house
     black as pitch.  The S.W.A.T. team puts on their
     night vision goggles and starts moving through the
     house.

     P.O.V. THROUGH NIGHT VISION GOGGLES as the S.W.A.T.
     team goes through the house SHOOTING cultists (ala
     the computer game DOOM).  Then a blinding flash of
     light and a S.W.A.T. guy goes down -- shot in the
     face.

     Several of the cultists lead the attacking S.W.A.T.
     team deeper into the house.  As one of the S.W.A.T.
     guys follows his foot trips a wire.  A trap door
     opens in the floor and the S.W.A.T. guy falls into
     a pit, waist deep in water.  Suddenly, the water
     starts churning and the guy starts screaming -- it's
     a tank of piranhas!  Two other S.W.A.T. guys grab
     his arms and pull him out.  Too late -- his legs
     have been shredded to the bone.

     Another S.W.A.T. guy kicks in a door to a room and
     steps in, FIRING his machine gun.  A large scythe
     swings down and severs both his arms at the elbows.
     His arms fall to the floor, still FIRING the machine
     gun.

     The cultists race into a room, grabbing handrailing
     bolted over head.  They swing like monkeys across
     the ceiling just as a S.W.A.T. guy charges into the
     room behind them.

     CLOSE ON S.W.A.T. GUY'S BOOTS as he steps onto a floor
     covered with upturned nails.  Several nails puncture
     both boots, the points coming up through the laces.
     The S.W.A.T. guy screams and another S.W.A.T. guy
     barrels into the room to see what is wrong.  He knocks
     the first guy face-first into the floor o' nails.

     Meanwhile, Murdoch is having a blast -- literally.
     He kicks open the door to a room and guns down three
     cultists as they try to escape out a window.  As
     the last body pitches to the floor, Murdoch yells:

                    MURDOCH
          Freeze!

     Murdoch exits, laughing to himself.

     The running GUNBATTLE continues as the cultists
     retreat to the back of the house, throwing molotov
     cocktails.  Soon the first floor is ablaze. A S.W.A.T.
     guy screams as he is consumed by FIRE.  The cultists
     thunder down a back staircase to the...


     INT. THE BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     The cultists uncover a secret passageway under the
     house and most escape through the underground tunnel
     just before the S.W.A.T. team comes BLASTING into
     the basement.  As the last of the remaining cultists
     is capped off, a faint voice cries for help.  The
     S.W.A.T. commander raises up his hand.

                    S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
          Hold your fire!

     He pulls off his night vision goggles and shines his
     flashlight into the basement.  Through the dense
     smoke he sees a little girl in a white dress is tied
     to a chair sitting on a crate.  Underneath the chair
     -- several sticks of dynamite wired to a timer. CLOSE
     ON THE TIMER: 30... 29... 28...

                    LITTLE GIRL HOSTAGE
          Help me, mister... please.

     The S.W.A.T. commander rushes to the girl, kneeling
     down to look at the bomb.  Then he takes a Leatherman
     tool from his vest and starts to work on the bomb's
     timer.

                    S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
          Hang on, honey... I'll have you
          out of there in a second.

     Murdoch comes down the stairs.  He goes to the secret
     passageway and says:

                    MURDOCH
          Looks like we'll have to hunt the
          rest of them down. Let's go before
          they get too far.

                    S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
          We can't leave! Can't you see
          we've got a situation here?

     Murdoch looks at the little girl and shrugs.

                    MURDOCH
          Leave her.

                    S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
          You're crazy! I can't just leave
          her!

                    MURDOCH
          Forget it. I've seen this before.
          There's nothing you can do.

                    S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
          I've got to try...

     The S.W.A.T. commander wipes his brow and leans in
     to work on the bomb again.  CLOSE ON TIMER: 24...
     23... 22...

     The basement ceiling is now fully ABLAZE and chunks
     of BURNING DEBRIS fall around the skittish S.W.A.T.
     team.  Murdoch looks at his watch in a bored fashion.

                    MURDOCH
          You're wasting your time.

     The S.W.A.T. commander studies the wires for another
     second, then glances back at the timer... 15... 14...
     13...

                    S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
          Fuck it!

     The S.W.A.T. commander whips out his Spyderco knife
     and cuts the little girl loose.  He carries her out
     in his arms as he shouts to his men:

                    S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
               (continuing; yelling)
          CLEAR OUT! SHE'S GOIN' BLOW!!!

     The S.W.A.T. team exits the basement with Murdoch
     bringing up the rear.


     EXT. CULT COMPOUND - NEXT INSTANT

     The S.W.A.T. commander staggers out with the little
     girl, followed closely with the remainder of his men
     and finally Murdoch.  The commander throws himself to
     the ground, covering the little girl with his body as
     -- BA-BOOM!!! -- the Elm Street house EXPLODES!

     Murdoch stands as debris rains down around him.  He
     mutters:

                    MURDOCH
          Punks.

     As the dust settles, the S.W.A.T. commander rolls off
     the little girl and starts checking her for injury.

                    S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
          Are you okay, honey?

     Suddenly, the little girl jumps onto the S.W.A.T.
     commander, flashing a glove of knives.  She hisses:

                    LITTLE GIRL HOSTAGE
          Freddy lives!

     With a quick swing, the little girl slashes the
     commander's face.  She dives back for a plunge to
     his throat when Murdoch walks up and kicks her off.
     He puts his boot on her, holding her down as he
     takes aim on her head with his pistol -- execution
     style.

                    S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
          NO!

     The S.W.A.T. commander grabs Murdoch's arm just in
     time.  Several cops rush in and grab the girl,
     dragging her off, kicking and screaming.

                    S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
               (continuing)
          Jesus... you were going to kill
          that kid, weren't you?

                    MURDOCH
          I told you you were wasting your
          time. Once these kids go rabid,
          best thing to do is put 'em down.

                    S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
          You can't be serious...

                    MURDOCH
          Dead serious. See... the world is
          made up of rules. Kids don't like
          rules. They rebel for a while, but
          ultimately they start to fall in
          line and become ordinary Joe's like
          you and me. But some kids... dope
          smokers mainly, watching their MTV...
          Satanic lyrics melting what's left
          of their brains... these kids grow
          up to be punks. And when these punks
          step as far over the line as these
          "Freddy" punks have -- then we as
          peace officers have no choice but
          to kill them.

                    S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
          I didn't become a peace officer to
          kill kids.

                    MURDOCH
          Punks. There's a difference...
               (under his breath)
          ...barely.

                            CUT TO:

     INT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

     CLOSE ON GRAFFITI written across lockers -- FREDDY
     LIVES!

     We move from this to a small classroom window. Through
     it we see Meagan sitting in economics class.  The
     instructor -- MISS KREPPS -- is lecturing.

                    MISS KREPPS
          (Blah-blah. Blah-blah-blah.)

     It's hot.  Several of the kids fan themselves,
     struggling to stay awake while others have already
     passed out on their desks.  Meagan's eyes are heavy.
     She looks over at Jesse, pretending to follow along
     in his book, fast asleep.  The antique oscillating
     fan on Miss Krepps' desk CLICKS loudly as she drones
     on:

                    MISS KREPPS
               (continuing)
          (Blah-blah-blah. Blah-blah.)

     Meagan starts to drift off, when...

                    MISS KREPPS
               (continuing; loud)
          Meagan!?

                    MEAGAN
          Yes, ma'am?

                    MISS KREPPS
          I asked if you were ready to give
          your oral report?

                    MEAGAN
          Yes... I'm ready.

                    MISS KREPPS
          Please come up here to the podium.

     Meagan gets up and goes to the podium amidst the
     snickers of some of her classmates.  Miss Krepps
     snaps her fingers for quiet.

                    MISS KREPPS
               (continuing)
          You won't think it's funny when
          you haven't learned the fundamentals
          of a free market economy... oh,
          why do I waste my breath? You're
          all going to grow up to be gas
          station attendants and waitresses
          anyway. Go ahead, Meagan.

                    MEAGAN
          My report is on Global Economic
          Trends.
               (clears throat;
                     begins reading)
          Try and think of a world where there
          is no poverty... no sickness... no
          crime. A world where everyone is
          happy to be alive and everyone lives
          together in peace. This is my dream.

     The fan on Miss Krepps' desk starts to CLICK louder,
     BLOWING harder.  Meagan raises an eyebrow but continues
     with her report.

                    MEAGAN
               (continuing)
          This dream is becoming a reality
          with ever-growing international
          business...

     CLOSE ON THE FAN as it changes... getting creepier...
     turning into a Freddy-fan.  BLOWING harder... CLICKING
     louder.

                    MISS KREPPS
          Louder, Meagan. We can't hear you.

     Meagan repeats the last few sentences, raising her
     voice to be heard over the fan.  Then pages of her
     report start to blow away.  She grabs at them as the
     WIND increases.

     A bottle of glue stowed in the podium overturns and
     spills to the floor at Meagan's feet.  She bends over
     to pick it up, when her skirt blows up.  She presses
     it down but the WIND is too great and the skirt
     billows up, revealing her underwear.  The class roars
     with laughter.

                    MISS KREPPS
               (continuing)
          Louder, Meagan... we still can't
          hear you.

     But Meagan isn't reading her report anymore, she's
     busy trying to push down her skirt when -- RIP! --
     the WIND blows her skirt off.  Her classmates fall
     over themselves, laughing.  RIP! -- Meagan's blouse
     blows away.  She tries to hide behind the podium when
     that too is swept off.

     Meagan clutches at her bra and panties as they start
     to drift away -- thread by thread.  She is almost
     naked.  Meagan looks up at her classmates, red in the
     face.

     Her classmates point and laugh -- only now they are
     all a bunch of old rotten skeletons.  And up front,
     in the center where Miss Krepps sat... is Freddy! He
     wears a beanie with a propeller, points and laughs:

                    FREDDY
          Aww... all dressed up and nowhere
          to blow!

     Meagan screams, clutching at the last few tiny strands
     of cloth that cover her body.  She calls to Jesse,
     pleading:

                    MEAGAN
          Jesse... please, help me.

     But Jesse just sits at his desk -- dead.  He reaches
     up and slowly lowers a hockey mask over his pale,
     expressionless face.

                    FREDDY
          Looks like a photo opportunity to
          me!

     Freddy pulls out an over-sized camera with a gargantuan
     flashgun attached.  The flash bulb is the size of a
     beach ball and has a nuclear warning etched in the
     front.  Freddy sizes Meagan up in the viewfinder and
     sneers:

                    FREDDY
               (continuing)
          Say... cheesecake!

     PHOOMPH!!! -- the flash bulb goes off with an atomic
     light.  Meagan screams as her skeleton is blown back
     against the blackboard -- vaporized!

                         HARD CUT TO:

     Meagan waking up in her seat suddenly.  The classroom
     as normal.  Miss Krepps is standing over her, asking:

                    MISS KREPPS
          Meagan? Meagan?!

     Meagan looks around, bewildered and confused.

                    MISS KREPPS
               (continuing)
          I asked if you were ready to give
          your report?

     Meagan realizes that she was dreaming and pulls
     herself together.

                    MEAGAN
          Sure...

     Meagan stands up and faints.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. SCHOOL NURSE'S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

     MEAGAN'S P.O.V as the SCHOOL NURSE comes into FOCUS,
     standing over her.

                    SCHOOL NURSE
          Meagan? Can you hear me? Do you
          know where you are?

     Meagan is laying on a couch, a cloth over her head.

                    MEAGAN
          I was day dreaming and then I woke
          up but then it was like I was still
          dreaming and then I woke up and
          then I guess I fainted and now I'm
          awake again...

                    SCHOOL NURSE
          Are you sure?

     Meagan stares at the nurse for a moment.

                    SCHOOL NURSE
               (continuing)
          Meagan?

                    MEAGAN
          I'm waiting to see if you're going
          to turn into Freddy.

                    SCHOOL NURSE
          Freddy... I see. You've been watching
          too much CNN. That crazy "Freddy"
          cult thing -- it's all over the TV
          day and night -- you can't get away
          from it. No wonder you kids are all
          having nightmares.

                    MEAGAN
          But this one was different... it
          felt real.

                    SCHOOL NURSE
          But that's just it, Meagan... dreams
          aren't real. They're just broken
          fragments of the subconscious mind.

                    MEAGAN
          Fear is real though, isn't it? And
          if nightmares are fear, then doesn't
          that make them real?!
               (gets excited)
          And if the nightmares are real then
          is reality like a dream?!

                    SCHOOL NURSE
               (cutting her off)
          Meagan! You've got heat prostration...
          that's all.

     The nurse slaps a wet towel over her face.


     INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

     Jesse is waiting for Meagan as she emerges from the
     nurse's office, muttering under her breath:

                    MEAGAN
          Old witch... what does she know?
          She isn't even qualified to give a
          shot and she's telling me that my
          dreams aren't anything to worry
          about.

                    JESSE
          So she said you were okay?

                    MEAGAN
          Oh, sure... Madame Curie in there
          says it's just a case of heat pro-
          stration and an overdose of TV news.
          Ruined my makeup, too.

                    JESSE
          So you're going back to class?

                    MEAGAN
          No. She gave me last period off.

                    JESSE
          Well, what are you bitching about?
          I could have a compound fracture of
          the skull and she wouldn't excuse me
          from P.E.

                    MEAGAN
          Jesse! I've been having nightmares
          for almost two weeks now and they
          keep getting worse! Now I'm having
          daymares! I want to know why!

                    JESSE
          Okay... well, didn't the nurse say
          it was heat probation?

     Meagan rolls her eyes in frustration.

                    MEAGAN
          You don't understand... I want to
          know more about dreams. What they
          mean... why we have them.

                    JESSE
          Okay, Meg, go look it up. You've
          got the rest of the day off, that's
          all I'm saying.

                    MEAGAN
          That's a good idea. Why don't you
          cut last period and come with me?

                    JESSE
          Sure. Where are we going?

                    MEAGAN
          The library.

                    JESSE
          You want me to cut school so we can
          go to the library?

                            CUT TO:

     INT. LIBRARY - AFTERNOON

     Meagan pours through a big psychology book.  Across
     the table, Jesse peers into another psychology book.

                    MEAGAN
          Find anything?

     Jesse looks up suddenly.

                    JESSE
          What? Oh, no... nothing yet.

     Over Jesse's shoulder we see he has a copy of ROAD &
     TRACK tucked inside his psychology book.

                    MEAGAN
          Did you know that our sub-conscious
          retains everything that ever happened
          to us? Everything. From the time
          we're born until we die.

                    JESSE
          Really?

                    MEAGAN
          That's how Freddy gets at us...
          by using our sub-conscious fears.
          Fears our conscious minds have
          repressed or forgotten.

                    JESSE
          I've got a news flash for you...
          Freddy's dead.

                    MEAGAN
          I'm not so sure... if Freddy exists
          in our sub-conscious then he can
          never be fully erased. Like a bad
          memory... you may blot it out of
          your mind but it will alway be
          hiding someplace in your dreams.
               (off Jesse's
                     disbelieving stare)
          Weren't you scared as a child by
          something so stupid that you're
          ashamed to admit it?

                    JESSE
          No.

                    MEAGAN
          No?

                    JESSE
          Well, yeah.

                    MEAGAN
          Well, what? What is it?

                    JESSE
          Well... when I was kid, my brother
          took me to the carnival. And in the
          penny arcade there was this robot
          gunslinger...

                    MEAGAN
          Black Bart.

                    JESSE
          You know about Black Bart?

                    MEAGAN
          Duh. You put your quarter in and he
          says, "Go ahead and draw, tenderfoot."
          And then you pull your gun out and
          shoot him.

                    JESSE
          That's just it -- I never could!
          I'd point the gun right at him and
          shoot, and I could never hit the guy.
          So I always got killed.

                    MEAGAN
          No one can hit him -- it's a gyp.

                    JESSE
          Scared the shit out of me.

     Meagan tries to hide her smile.

                    JESSE
               (continuing;
                     flustered)
          Isn't that scary? I mean... for a
          kid?

     Meagan laughs.  Somebody shushes her.

                    JESSE
               (continuing;
                     mad)
          Okay, smartass... what about you?
          What scared you the most as a kid?

     A dark mood falls over Meagan as her mind winds back.

                    MEAGAN
          I remember... Lizzy wandered off
          one day and we couldn't find her.
          The police came and everything. I
          wasn't really worried until I saw
          her picture on TV... then I got
          really scared.
               (then)
          Jesse, I can't explain it... but I
          think something bad's going to
          happen.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. SPECIAL SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

     Lizzy sits on the steps of her school, clutching
     her books and Raggedy Ann doll... waiting. Behind
     her, wearing a protective helmet, another learning
     disabled kid - LEONARD - taunts her.

                    LEONARD
          You're stupid!

                    LIZZY
          No, you are!

                    LEONARD
          They forgot you again!

                    LIZZY
          No, they didn't!

                    LEONARD
          Yes, they forgot and you're goin'
          to wait out here until it's dark
          and then the monsters are goin'
          come and get you!

                    LIZZY
          No they won't, because I'm walkin'
          home!

     Lizzy gets to her feet and starts walking.  Leonard
     calls after her:

                    LEONARD
          Come back, Lizzy! You can wait with
          me! I got forgot too, you know!

     Lizzy keeps going, marching across the deserted school
     yard.  Leonard turns to go inside the school when he
     bumps into a passing CULTIST.  The cultist pushes him
     down as he follows after Lizzy.

                    LEONARD
               (continuing)
          Okay... I'm going to have to report
          this!

     Lizzy walks briskly along when she gets the feeling
     she's being followed.  She turns and sees a cultist
     standing behind a tree several dozen yards behind her.
     Lizzy turns away and quickens her pace but when she
     glances back, the figure is still standing... but
     closer.

     Scared, Lizzy turns and runs, dropping her books as
     she flees down the sidewalk.  As she comes to the
     street, a big black hearse suddenly pulls up in front
     of her, the door swinging open wide.  Burned arms
     reach out to grab Lizzy.  She screams.

     The cultists grab Lizzy, pulling her into the car as
     it roars off down the street.

     CLOSE ON RAGGEDY ANN -- laying in the gutter.

                            CUT TO:

     EXT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

     Jesse's car pulls up to a sea of police cars parked
     in front of Meagan's house.  Meagan gets out of the
     car and rushes inside.


     INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     COPS are everywhere as Meagan bursts into the house,
     calling for her family.  Jesse enters behind her when
     Meagan's dad comes up, asking:

                    MEAGAN'S DAD
          Didn't you get my message?

                    MEAGAN
          What message?

                    MEAGAN'S DAD
          I called the school after lunch...
          I had to stay late after work...
          I...

     Meagan's mother bellows from the living room where
     she is talking to a policeman taking notes.  She is
     drunk and has been crying.

                    MEAGAN'S MOM
          Don't you dare blame this on her,
          you sorry bastard! It's all your
          fault!
               (to Meagan)
          Where have you been anyway?

                    MEAGAN
          The library.

                    MEAGAN'S MOM
          A likely Goddamn story!

     Meagan's mom breaks down sobbing.

                    MEAGAN
          Dad... what's wrong? What's happened?
          Where's Lizzy?

                    MEAGAN'S DAD
          She didn't come home from school
          today. The police got a report that
          a girl fitting Lizzy's description
          was forced into a car by some
          crazies. They're pretty sure it was
          this "Freddy" cult.

                    MEAGAN
               (shocked)
          Oh, my God...

     Meagan's dad puts his arm around Meagan and tries to
     comfort her.

                    MEAGAN'S DAD
          Now don't worry. The police are
          doing everything they can.

     Meagan looks over and sees Murdoch talking to his
     men when a voice from upstairs calls down:

                    TROOPER
               (O.S.)
          Hey, Cap'n... better have a look
          up here!


     INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - NEXT SECOND

     As Murdoch enters, he spots Lizzy's night table and
     the small glass menagerie there.  Murdoch picks up
     the unicorn and admires it when a TROOPER draws his
     attention to the floor next to the bed.

     Laying there are several childlike drawings of Freddy,
     including one that has "Freddy Lives" scrawled across
     the top.

     Meagan enters and sees the drawings.  She gasps.

                    TROOPER
          Looks like she was in the cult all
          along.

                    MEAGAN
          No... no, she wouldn't do that!
          Lizzy wouldn't join Freddy's cult!

                    TROOPER
          I know it's hard to believe, miss.
          But a lot of good kids get caught
          up in this kind of trouble.

     Murdoch stares at the drawings, his jaw muscles
     tightening.  He clenches his fist, pulverizing the
     little unicorn.

                    MURDOCH
          Punks...

     Murdoch drops the broken pieces of the unicorn on
     the table as he exits the room, brushing past Meagan.


     INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

     Meagan's dad follows Murdoch to the door, asking:

                    MEAGAN'S DAD
          Captain Murdoch... is there any-
          thing we can do?

                    MURDOCH
          You can pray, sir. Pray we find your
          daughter before... well, before it's
          too late. But rest assured, if I
          can't persuade her to come back to
          her loving home, then I'll do what's
          best for her. I know you and your
          wife wouldn't want her to suffer.
               (to his men)
          Come on... I want to go talk to
          Erwin.

     Murdoch and his men say "good-bye" and quickly exit.


     EXT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

     As the last of the cops drive away, Meagan pulls
     Jesse out of the house.

                    JESSE
          Where are we going?

                    MEAGAN
          Over to Stormie's.

                    JESSE
          Stormie? I thought you and her weren't
          friends anymore since she stole that
          twenty dollars from you.

                    MEAGAN
          That was her "klepto" phase... when
          she was dating that gang member.
          She dumped him a long time ago.

                    JESSE
          I still don't understand. What has
          she got to do with Lizzy missing?

                    MEAGAN
          She used to be in the Freddy cult.
          Maybe she knows where they took
          Lizzy.

     They exit to Jesse's car.

                            CUT TO:

     INT. STORMIE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON

     Meagan's high-strung best friend -- STORMIE -- is
     blurting out at a mile-a-minute:

                    STORMIE
          If I did know I would call the
          police, you know that. I love Lizzy.
          No telling what those freaks will
          do to her. Those Freddy cult guys
          are hard core.

                    JESSE
          I thought you were in the cult?

                    STORMIE
          I was in the cult for a week cause
          my boyfriend at the time... Slasher,
          he was. But I just liked the music
          and the clothes... when they were
          clean, but not like the violence
          and stuff. But that was just my
          "cult" phase... but I got past that.
          You know, just like my "gang" phase
          when I was dating Ramon and then
          before that was my "death rock"
          phase when I was dating Stuart...

                    JESSE
          Uh, excuse me... but what phase
          are we in now?

                    STORMIE
          Militant feminist, man-hating phase,
          what's it fuckin' to ya?!

                    JESSE
               (to Meagan)
          Why don't you just let the cops find
          her? That guy Renton Murdoch -- he
          knows how to deal with these cultist
          psychos. He was the man who got Jason
          Voorhees.

                    MEAGAN
          That guy in my dreams...

                    STORMIE
          Jason kicked his ass.

                                 QUICK CUT TO:

     EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - SOME YEARS AGO - NIGHT

     Jesse narrates a short, fuzzy, silent flashback as
     younger-looking Renton Murdoch is BLASTING away at
     Jason in panic.

                    JESSE
               (V.O.)
          Well... yeah. But Murdoch put
          thirteen bullets in Jason before
          he hacked his head open.

     Jason cleaves Murdoch's head with a machete.  Murdoch
     staggers back, raising his pistol.

                    JESSE
               (V.O.,
                     continuing)
          But even with his head hacked open
          and his brains leaking out, Murdoch
          still managed to put his last bullet
          in Jason's eye.

     Murdoch FIRES, the bullet SMACKING Jason in the eye.
     Thick blood runs down the hockey mask as Murdoch's
     body hits the ground.


     INT. HOSPITAL ROOM-

     Murdoch lays in a bed, his head covered in bandages.
     Tubes and hoses running everywhere to all sorts of
     medical contraptions.

                    STORMIE
               (V.O.)
          Well, one of my mom's boyfriends
          worked at the hospital where they
          took him. He said that Murdoch lost
          more than half his brain and what
          little that was left was all twisted
          up inside. And they had to replace
          his skull with a metal plate to
          keep that from leaking out.

     In a series of quick cuts we move in close on Murdoch's
     eyes -- dark and menacing -- staring out at us.

                    STORMIE
               (V.O.,
                     continuing)
          They say he hasn't been the same
          since.

                         CUT BACK TO:

     INT. STORMIE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

                    JESSE
          So what's different about him?

                    STORMIE
          One thing... he used to be a
          Democrat. Now he votes straight
          Republican.

                    MEAGAN
          I think he thinks Lizzy joined the
          cult or something.

                    STORMIE
          Oh, my God... he'll kill her.

                    MEAGAN
          I've got to find Lizzy myself. I've
          got to find her and save her from
          Freddy before that crazy cop kills
          her.

                    JESSE
          Just where are you going to look?
          I mean, these cult guys could be
          holding her anywhere.

                    MEAGAN
          Murdoch said something about going
          to talk to somebody named Erwin.

                    STORMIE
          Erwin Kelper! He used to be in the
          Freddy cult! I bet he knows where
          they took Lizzy!

                    JESSE
          Not Squirmin' Erwin -- that freak
          that used to eat bugs?

                    STORMIE
               (annoyed)
          Who else?
               (to Meagan; bright)
          Erwin is scary smart -- always brought
          home "A"s -- but he was kinda fucked
          up, too... I mean, who isn't really?
          Anyway, he quit the cult a few months
          back and the cops put him away for
          his own safety. They say Freddy's
          put a death hex on Erwin.

                    JESSE
          A death hex?

                    STORMIE
          Yes, a death hex. You know... where
          someone wants you dead!

                    MEAGAN
          Where is he?

                            CUT TO:

     EXT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - AFTERNOON

     Jesse, Meagan, and Stormie pull past the large sign
     and into the parking lot.  As Jesse puts the car in
     park, Meagan turns to him and says:

                    MEAGAN
          I want you to stay here.

                    JESSE
          Why?

                    MEAGAN
          Don't be mad... it's just that you
          might scare him.

                    JESSE
          Scare him?

                    STORMIE
          What she's subtly trying to tell
          you is that this needs a woman's
          gentle touch... butthead.

                    MEAGAN
          Just stay here... okay?

     Jesse grudgingly agrees.  Meagan kisses Jesse on the
     cheek.  Stormie sticks her tongue out at him, then
     turns as she and Meagan walk toward the main entrance.


     INT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

     The CRIES of the insane echo through the building as
     the SECURITY GUARD escorts Meagan and Stormie down a
     row of cell doors.  He stops at one, tapping lightly
     on the glass.

                    SECURITY GUARD
          Yo, Erwin... you've got a couple
          of visitors. Now be a good boy...
               (to Meagan & Stormie)
          You've got five minutes. I'll be
          right down the hall if you need me.

     The guard exits.  Meagan and Stormie peer through the
     thick window -- Erwin's padded cell appears vacant.
     They exchange anxious looks, then Meagan presses a
     little closer to the glass.

                    MEAGAN
          Erwin...?

     SPLAT! -- ERWIN suddenly presses his horribly burned
     face to the glass as he screams:

                    ERWIN
          SHOW ME YOUR ARMS! YOUR ARMS!

     Meagan and Stormie jump back, startled.  Then they
     quickly bare their arms, turning them over for Erwin's
     inspection.

                    ERWIN
               (continuing)
          Where do you shoot?

                    MEAGAN
          Shoot?

                    STORMIE
          He's talking about dream dope --
          the stuff the cultists shoot up
          with so they can talk to Freddy.

                    MEAGAN
          I don't do drugs.

                    ERWIN
          You're not in the cult?

                    MEAGAN
          No.

                    ERWIN
          Didn't Freddy send you to kill me?

                    MEAGAN/STORMIE
          No.

                    ERWIN
          I don't trust you... better take off
          your clothes so I can check you for
          tracks.

                    STORMIE
          Chill, Erwin. We're here for some
          hard data -- not a floppy disk.

     Erwin flops the arms of his straight jacket, gesturing
     to the inside of his cell -- empty except for a small
     mattress.

                    ERWIN
          Well, what do you want? Can't you
          see I'm busy?

                    MEAGAN
          Freddy's cult kidnapped my sister.

                    STORMIE
          I told her you might know where
          they took her.

                    ERWIN
          I already told the cops everything
          I know.

                    MEAGAN
          Tell me... please.

                    ERWIN
          Look... I'm sorry about your sister,
          but I've got my own problems with
          Freddy. I'm a marked man, you know.

                    MEAGAN
          Then tell me why they took her...

                    ERWIN
          To bear his child. Freddy wants to
          be human again. In order to do that
          he has to be "reborn".

                    MEAGAN
          How can he do that?

                    ERWIN
          He has to marry a virgin on holy
          ground. Then the cult consumate
          the marriage by impregnating her.

                    STORMIE
          The whole cult? Yeech!

                    ERWIN
          Freddy's the son of a hundred maniacs.
          It's sort of a tradition with him.

                    MEAGAN
          So the cult gets Lizzy pregnant?

                    ERWIN
          And Freddy enters the soul of the
          fetus through a dream state. Voila!
          Rebirth.

     There is a moment as the girls take this in, then:

                    STORMIE
          That's the stupidest shit I ever
          heard.

                    ERWIN
          Hey, they're not my rules... some-
          body else wrote 'em.

                    MEAGAN
          Erwin... you've got to help me find
          Lizzy. You're my only hope.

     Erwin thinks about this for a second, then:

                    ERWIN
          I'll help you find your sister, but
          you've got to help me.

                    MEAGAN
          Anything. Just name it.

                    ERWIN
          You have to help me kill Freddy.

     Meagan and Stormie exchange looks.

                    STORMIE
          But Freddy's dead.

                    ERWIN
          Freddy lives...
               (looks at Meagan)
          If only in our dreams.

     Stormie grabs Meagan by the arm and starts to pull
     her away.

                    STORMIE
          Come on, Meagan... our five minutes
          is up. He's giving me the creeps.

     But Meagan stays put and asks Erwin:

                    MEAGAN
          How can you kill a dream?

                    ERWIN
          When it's not a dream.
               (then)
          Do we have a deal?

     Erwin presses his palm against the glass.  Meagan
     thinks a moment, then puts her hand against the glass
     over his.

                    MEAGAN
          Deal.

                            CUT TO:

     EXT. STREET CORNER - AFTERNOON - A SHORT TIME LATER

     Meagan, Jesse, and Stormie are standing in front of
     a pay phone, arguing.

                    JESSE
          No! I won't do it!

                    MEAGAN
          Come on, Jesse! Please...?

                    JESSE
          It's illegal! I could go to jail!

                    STORMIE
          How will they ever know? Don't be
          such a pussy!

                    JESSE
          Oh, yeah? Why don't you call then?

                    STORMIE
          Okay, I will!

                    MEAGAN
          No! They'll never believe her!

                    STORMIE
          I can disguise my voice...
               (lowers voice)
          Hello, how do you do? My name is
          Jesse. I think I'm a man but I'm
          actually a wimp.

                    MEAGAN
          They'll never believe that. Come
          on, Jesse... for me?

                    JESSE
          Okay... okay... I'll do it.
               (to Stormie)
          And I'm not a wimp!

     Jesse sighs and steps into the phone booth.  After a
     moment's hesitation, Jesse steps out and immediately
     both girls blurt out ten reasons why he should make
     the call.  Jesse calls for quiet and as soon as both
     girls shut up, he says:

                    JESSE
               (continuing)
          I need a quarter for the phone.

     Meagan fishes out a quarter and hands it to him.  Jesse
     re-enters the booth.

     ANGLE IN PHONE BOOTH as Jesse dials a number.


     INT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - NEXT INSTANT

     The security guard picks up his phone as it RINGS.

                    SECURITY GUARD
          Springwood Mental Center... how
          can I help you?

                    JESSE
               (filtered; disguising
                     his voice)
          There's a bomb planted in your
          building.

                    SECURITY GUARD
          Who is this?

                    JESSE
          If I were you -- I'd get my ass
          out of there.

     In the background, we hear Meagan and Stormie whisper
     something to Jesse.

                    JESSE
               (continuing; adding)
          Oh, yeah... Freddy Lives.

     CLICK! -- The guard's eyes grow wide.


     EXT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - AFTERNOON -SECONDS LATER

     The peaceful quiet of the asylum is shattered by a
     fire ALARM.  Soon all the INMATES start filing out
     into the yard, loosely herded by the GUARDS.  Erwin
     files out with the others, still wearing his straight
     jacket.

     Erwin looks over at the parking lot -- Jesse's car
     flashes it's lights.  Erwin starts to casually wander
     off towards the fence between himself and freedom
     when the SECURITY GUARD spots him and says:

                    SECURITY GUARD
          Hey, Erwin... where do you think
          you're going?

     Erwin ignores him, still moving towards the fence.

                    SECURITY GUARD
               (continuing)
          I'm talking to you, asshole!

     Erwin breaks into a run.  The guard takes off after
     him.

     In the car, Jesse, Meagan, and Stormie watch as the
     guard closes the distance.

                    JESSE
          He's not going to make it.

                    MEAGAN
          We've got to do something!

     With grim determination, Jesse starts his car.

     Jesse's car tears out of the parking lot, racing for
     the fence.  With a loud, metallic CHING, Jesse's car
     drives into the fence, knocking that section down.
     Erwin dances over the downed chain-link, diving into
     an open window.  Then, with a SQUEAL of tires and the
     RENDING of metal, Jesse's car backs out of the fence,
     does a 180, and PEELS off.

     ANGLE INSIDE CAR as Stormie and Meagan help Erwin out
     of his straight jacket.  Once freed, Erwin extends his
     hand to Jesse.

                    ERWIN
          Hi, my name's Erwin. Thanks for
          busting me out of there!

     Jesse looks at Erwin's outstretched hand -- the
     fingertips are all heavily bandaged.

                    JESSE
          Yeah, right... Look, Erwin, just do
          me one favor -- don't eat nothing
          disgusting. My stomach is tight
          enough as it is.

     The security guard runs up to the fence, huffing and
     puffing, watching as Jesse's car disappears down the
     street.  Then he spots something in the fence and
     plucks it out...

     Jesse's front license plate.

                            CUT TO:

     INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - DUSK

     CLOSE ON LIZZY, screaming and crying as the cultists
     close in around her.  They rip her sleeve off and
     inject her with a syringe.  After a moment, Lizzy
     starts to settle down... falling asleep...

     The cultists lift Lizzy up over their heads and carry
     her towards the big boiler.  Inside -- a raging INFERNO.

     LIZZY'S DREAM STATE P.O.V. -- as the cultists reach
     the boiler, it splits open in the middle like a giant
     gate.  The two halves swing open wide to reveal...


     INT. HELL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     A narrow rocky ledge extends out to a mausoleum atop
     a tall, narrow mountain.  On either side of the ledge
     is a sheer drop to the bleak landscape below -- rivers
     of hot molten lava stretching out for miles, filled
     with LOST SOULS DROWNING and BURNING.  Hundreds upon
     hundreds of voices are SCREAMING and MOANING -- a
     terrible chorus of the damned.

     The cultists carry Lizzy across the rocky ledge to
     the mausoleum.  The outside of this ancient structure
     is engraved with weird murals depicting the evils of
     mankind.  In the center -- a large iron gate that
     swings open as the cultists near.

     The cultists roll Lizzy over in their arms, holding
     her tight as they push her face forward into the
     mirror.  The glass gives way like mercury, Lizzy's
     face disappearing into the mirror.

     ANGLE ON THE OTHER SIDE (UNDERWATER) -- Lizzy's
     face stares out into utter blackness.  Then, some-
     thing large and evil looking swims up out of the
     darkness.  Clawed hands reach out and grab Lizzy by
     the sides of the face as the huge, monstrous head
     moves forward -- evil lips parting -- tongue slithering
     out.

     The evil thing gives Lizzy a big, wet French kiss,
     locking it's lips over hers.  Several slippery some-
     things slither into her mouth.  Lizzy struggles, but
     the big evil thing is way too strong.  Finally, it
     releases her and the cultists pull her back out.

     The cultists carry Lizzy out of Hell and back into
     the...


     INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Horribly burned hands slap Lizzy back from her semi-
     conscious state.  Her eyes grow wide with fear again
     as she opens her mouth to scream.  Suddenly, she
     doubles over and vomits up into a tupperware a
     cultist thrusts under her.

     Three evil-looking eels slither forth from Lizzy's
     mouth -- the Dream Demons.


     EXT. OLD POWER PLANT - DUSK

     Several shadows flee into the night as Jesse's car
     pulls up next to a run-down building.


     INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

     Erwin leads Meagan, Jesse and Stormie down into the
     old, burnt out boiler room.  They work their way
     towards the back, to a large table and a collection
     of sofas and easy chair scattered about.  Erwin
     starts sniffing around, pointing out several used
     syringes laying scattered about the floor.

                    ERWIN
          Damn! We must have just missed them!

     Meagan spots Lizzy's shirt sleeve on the floor.

                    MEAGAN
          Oh, my God -- she was here! This
          is part of Lizzy's shirt! It's all
          torn!
               (grabs Erwin)
          Erwin... we've got to find her!

                    ERWIN
          We're too late! There's no way...
          except...

                    MEAGAN
          Except what?!

                    ERWIN
          We could go after Freddy.

                    MEAGAN
          How?

     Erwin goes to a boiler, bends down and reaches way
     up underneath.  After fishing around for a moment,
     he draws out a well-worn Mutant Ninja Turtles lunch
     box.  Inside -- a vile of liquid, several syringes,
     and several pairs of cult shades.

                    ERWIN
          We'll inject ourselves with Dream
          Dope.  It's a mild narcotic that
          brings on a dreamlike state.

     Meagan thinks about this for a moment, then nods her
     approval.

                    MEAGAN
          Okay... let's do it!

                    JESSE
          Meagan... we don't do drugs! I mean,
          what if one of us gets hooked or
          something?
               (whispers)
          We could turn out like him!

     Jesse jerks a thumb toward Erwin.

                    ERWIN
          Don't worry about it. We need you
          wide awake anyway.

                    JESSE
          What for?

                    ERWIN
          We're going to go under and try to
          find Freddy. When we do, we'll grab
          him and bring him here. Then you
          kill him with this...

     Erwin hands Jesse an old rusty revolver.

                    JESSE
          This rusty chunk of shit? What
          good is this?

                    ERWIN
          It's not the gun, it's what's in
          it -- silver bullets blessed by a
          priest.

                    JESSE
          Will that work?

                    ERWIN
               (shrugs)
          Should. But then...

                    JESSE
               (finishes for him)
          You don't make the rules... yeah,
          yeah.

                    MEAGAN
          What should we do?

                    ERWIN
          Have a seat over there and make
          yourselves comfortable. Roll up
          your sleeves and put these on...

     Erwin hands Meagan and Stormie each a pair of the
     sunglasses with flashing red diodes in each lens.
     Stormie puts hers on immediately and says:

                    STORMIE
          Oh, cool!

                    MEAGAN
          What are they for?

                    ERWIN
          It's how the cult keeps in constant
          contact with Freddy. The little
          lights flashing are a sustained
          occular input that causes your brain
          to resonate at approximately the
          same frequency at which the dream
          state is most likely to occur.

     All of this went over Meagan's head.  Stormie shrugs:

                    STORMIE
          Whatever...
               (to Meagan; excited)
          Put 'em on -- they're really cool!

     Meagan and Stormie sit down in easy chairs, rolling
     up their sleeves.  Erwin comes over and reclines the
     chairs, giving each girl an injection.  Then Erwin
     takes a seat next to Meagan and injects himself.  He
     lets the syringe drop to the floor as he lowers his
     glasses.

                    ERWIN
          It helps to hold hands if you want
          to go together...

     Meagan clasps hands with Erwin and Stormie.  Jesse
     watches with skepticism and concern.  Erwin ushers
     a final warning:

                    ERWIN
               (continuing)
          And remember... Freddy knows what
          scares you.

     Then all three FALL THROUGH their chairs into...

     INT. DREAMSPACE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin falling through dreamspace
     (fantastic digital effect tunnel), still holding hands.
     The girls scream as Erwin smiles and yells:

                    ERWIN
          WHAT A RUSH, HUH?!!


     INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

     Jesse watches over Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin -- all
     asleep in their chairs.


     INT. NIGHTMARE BOILER ROOM - NEXT MOMENT

     Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin fall into a crazy night-
     mare boiler room (visually reminiscent of the Freddy
     pictures) with rusty catwalks, huge out-of-proportion
     fixtures above and a sea of boiling water below.  As
     they get to their feet, Meagan hears Lizzy's voice:

                    LIZZY
               (distant)
          Meagan... help me... please...

     Meagan enters a shaft, following the sound when
     suddenly, the shaft closes up behind her.  Stormie
     and Erwin try to find the opening again but can't.

                    ERWIN
          Freddy's trying to split us up...


     INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

     Jesse is standing in front of an old, full length
     mirror, practicing drawing the pistol.  He pulls it
     and pretends to fire, blowing imaginary smoke from
     the muzzle as he says:

                    JESSE
          Okay, Freddy... there's a new sheriff
          in Dreamland now.


     INT. NIGHTMARE BOILER ROOM - NEXT MOMENT

     Stormie and Erwin make their way through the creepy
     boiler room, calling for Meagan.  A strange shadow
     stalks them -- it's Freddy.  He drops down in front
     of Erwin and Stormie.

                    FREDDY
          Looking for some-body?

     Freddy opens up his shirt to reveal a chest full of
     lost souls.  In the center -- Meagan.  Stormie charges
     Freddy, throwing her arms around him as she screams
     to Erwin:

                    STORMIE
          I've got him! Wake us up! Wake
          us up!

     But Erwin is paralyzed with fear.

                    STORMIE
               (continuing)
          Don't just stand there! Wake us up!

                    FREDDY
          Hmmmmm... I feel like seafood tonight.

     Suddenly, Stormie's arms have become huge lobster
     claws.  She jerks away from Freddy, but too late --
     Stormie starts to change into a giant lobster-woman!
     Freddy smiles -- now he's wearing a chef's hat and
     apron.

                    FREDDY
               (continuing)
          Stew on this, bitch!

     Freddy knocks the lobster-woman over the side.  She
     falls into the boiling water far below -- KER-SPLASH!

                         HARD CUT TO:

     INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - NEXT INSTANT

     Stormie wakes with a start, yelling:

                    STORMIE
          Shoot him! Shoot him!

     Jesse spins, aiming the pistol.  But nothing is there.


     INT. NIGHTMARE BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

     Freddy turns toward Erwin.

                    FREDDY
          Well, well, well... if it isn't
          my ol' pal, Erwin.

     Erwin stares wide-eyed, frozen to the spot.

                    FREDDY
               (continuing)
          I've got something special in mind
          for you...

     Suddenly, Erwin reaches into his sleeve and pulls
     out a pin.  Freddy gawks -- surprised.  Erwin pricks
     his finger.

                         HARD CUT TO:

     INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - NEXT INSTANT

     Erwin wakes with a start.  Stormie smacks him.

                    STORMIE
          You didn't help me, you pussy!
          I could've had him!
               (smacks him some more)
          You gutless... spinless... jelly
          fish!

     Jesse looks over to where Meagan is still sleeping.


     INT. ELM STREET - DAY (DREAM)

     Meagan comes down the sidewalk, still following
     Lizzy's voice...

                    LIZZY
               (V.O.)
          Meagan... help me... Meagan...

     It leads her to her house.  Meagan enters the front
     door.


     INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Meagan sees her father is sitting at the kitchen
     table, reading his paper.  The headline reads:
     FREDDY LIVES!

                    MEAGAN
          Daddy?

     He looks up and quietly shushes her.

                    MEAGAN'S DAD
          Shuuuuu! I'm trying to be invisible...

     And with that, Meagan's dad disappears.  Only the
     newspaper remains.  Then Meagan hears Lizzy's VOICE
     again... upstairs.

     As she comes down the upstairs hallway, Meagan passes
     her mother's room.  The door is open a crack.  Meagan
     looks in and sees her mother putting an empty bottle
     to her lips.  The bottle sucks the life out of Meagan's
     mom, who shrivels up into an ugly ol' prune face.

     Meagan starts to help her mother when Lizzy's cry
     for help draws her to...


     INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Meagan enters.  She sees Lizzy on her bed, under the
     covers.

                    LIZZY
          Help me...

     Meagan pulls back the covers to reveal that Lizzy is
     pregnant, her naked, swollen stomach protruding from
     her night gown.  Something inside is trying to push
     it's way out.

                    LIZZY
               (continuing)
          Meagan...

     Lizzy screams.  Meagan moves to help her sister when
     Freddy's glove BURSTS OUT of Lizzy's stomach, stabbing
     Meagan in the chest.

                         HARD CUT TO:

     INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Meagan wakes up suddenly.  She looks up at Stormie,
     Erwin, and Jesse standing over her.

                    STORMIE
          Are you okay?

     They help Meagan to her feet.

                    MEAGAN
               (shaky)
          He got away... I had him and he
          got away. Oh, God... Lizzy... I
          lost her...

                    ERWIN
          Well, atleast you're not dead.

                    MEAGAN
          No... I'm not dead...
               (realizes)
          No... I'm not. But Freddy killed me!

                    STORMIE
          He killed me, too. But look...

     Stormie raises her shirt up to show Meagan she is
     unharmed.  Erwin sneaks a look and Stormie smacks him.
     Meagan gets to her feet, asking:

                    MEAGAN
          Now that I think about it -- he's
          killed me in all my nightmares. But
          I'm not dead... what does it mean?

                    ERWIN
          It means we've still got some time
          left. Until his remains are host to
          the Dream Demons -- Freddy can't
          hurt us.

                    JESSE
          Hello. The Dream Demons...?

                    ERWIN
          Freddy made a pact with Satan when
          he died... so Satan bestowed upon
          him the Dream Demons. They're the
          source of Freddy's power to manipulate
          our physical reality. Without them...
          he's powerless -- nothing more than
          a bad dream.
               (off Jesse's cynical
                     look)
          Hey, like I said... I don't make
          the rules.

                    MEAGAN
          But we've still got a chance, right?
          A chance to kill Freddy before he
          gets back his power?

                    ERWIN
          We already tried that. There's no
          way for us to kill Freddy. He's too
          clever. He knows how to get to us.

                    MEAGAN
          Then let's get somebody else. Some-
          body strong.

                    STORMIE
          Yeah! We could hire somebody to
          kill Freddy -- like a hit man!

                    ERWIN
          You would have to hire a thousand
          of them... or one really big guy
          who isn't afraid of anything. No
          fear. Nada. Then you got a shot.

                    JESSE
          Where are you going to find a hit
          man? The yellow pages? In your
          dreams...

     Jesse's last three words strike Meagan like a thunder-
     bolt and she stammers out a name:

                    MEAGAN
          Jason...

                    JESSE
          Jason?

                    MEAGAN
          Jason Voorhees...

                    ERWIN
               (brightens)
          Jason Voorhees... that's brilliant!
          The perfect dream warrior... no fear.

                    STORMIE
          Sounds like our man!

                    JESSE
          Uh... excuse me, Einstein... but
          isn't Jason Voorhees dead?

                    ERWIN
          Seriously dead. Buried up by Crystal
          Lake somewhere. But don't worry, I
          know how to bring him back to life.

                    JESSE
          Somehow I just knew you would.

                    ERWIN
          But that's not the problem. The
          problem is control. Once we bring
          Jason back from the dead... I'm not
          one hundred percent sure he'll do
          what we tell him.

                    STORMIE
          Well, that's okay... as long as he
          doesn't chop us all up.

     Erwin rolls his eyes around -- uncertain.

                    MEAGAN
          Erwin... I'm trusting you on this,
          so tell me the truth. Do you think
          if we do this -- if we go and get
          Jason and bring him back to life,
          that he could kill Freddy?

                    ERWIN
          No doubt about. Jason could wreck
          Freddy on this side of the Dreamline.
          But if Freddy has home court advan-
          tage... I don't know. Too close to
          call. The trick would be to get Jason
          to enter a dream state, grab Freddy,
          and drag him out to our reality.

                    MEAGAN
          I haven't got a choice. I've got to
          try something...
               (turns to Stormie &
                     Jesse)
          I can't ask either of you to help
          me do this... it's illegal, immoral,
          disgusting...

                    STORMIE
          Hey, we sisters have to stand
          together, right? Where you lead --
          I'll follow. Count me in.

     Meagan embraces Stormie, then all three turn to Jesse.
     He looks them over and sighs:

                    JESSE
          Let me get this straight... we're
          going to go dig one dead maniac up
          to fight another dead maniac?

                    ERWIN
          That's about the size of it... and
          I'd be doing you a disservice if I
          said there weren't a modicum of risk
          involved.

                    JESSE
          Meagan... I don't want to do this...

                    MEAGAN
          You don't have to, Jesse... it's not
          your fight. I understand.

                    JESSE
          But I damn sure don't want you to
          do it without me. Count me in.

     Meagan hugs Jesse.  Erwin tries to hug Stormie but
     she pushes him away.

                    ERWIN
          Look out Freddy... here we come.

                            CUT TO:

     EXT. SPRINGWOOD AUTO YARD - NIGHT

     In his shack, listening to a small portable radio,
     is the NIGHT WATCHMAN.  His small DOG suddenly perks
     up her ears and GROWLS low.  The watchman turns down
     the radio.

                    NIGHT WATCHMAN
          What's matter, girl... you hear
          somethin'?

     Then the old man hears it, too... A low RUMBLE. Moving
     closer.

     The night watchman steps out of his shack and squints
     into the darkness when a line of several hearses
     approaches.  The lead hearse pulls up to the shack and
     the driver's window rolls down.

                    NIGHT WATCHMAN
               (continuing)
          What's this? A funeral procession?

     A Freddy cultist sticks his face out of the window
     and says:

                    CULTIST
          That's exactly what it is.

                    NIGHT WATCHMAN
               (suspicious)
          Yeah? Whose?

                    CULTIST
          Yours.

     BANG! -- the cultist SHOOTS the old man right through
     the head.  The night watchman falls to the ground with
     a lifeless THUD.  The little dog starts BARKING
     ferociously when another SHOT silences her as well.

     Another cultist leaps out of the hearse and runs to
     the gate, cutting the chain with a pair of bolt
     cutters.  He swings the gate open and the funeral
     procession proceeds inside.


     INT. SPRINGWOOD AUTO YARD - A SHORT TIME LATER

     The cultists are standing around a small pit that two
     cultists are carefully excavating in the center of the
     wrecking yard.  Inside the pit, the uncovered remains
     of Freddy Krueger -- nothing more than a pile of
     charred bones.

     Lizzy is brought forward, held by a couple cultists,
     and injected with dream dope as the needle is passed
     around.  She no longer struggles, accepting her fate
     with droopy eyes.

     LIZZY'S DREAM DOPE P.O.V. -- as she watches one of
     the cultists reach down and put a rusty funnel into
     Freddy's broken jawbone.  Her vision gets blurry...
     more surreal as another cult member steps forward
     with the tupperware.  He pours the dream demons into
     the funnel.

     CLOSE ON FREDDY'S REMAINS as the dream demons swim
     around inside his skull.  His bones start to bleed...
     blood becoming arteries and veins... vessels becoming
     muscle... muscle growing scarred flesh...

     There is a FLASH from the pit.  Then suddenly, Freddy
     Krueger -- as you've known him, as you've loved him --
     leaps out of the pit and cries:

                    FREDDY
          Smokin'!

     Lizzy rolls her eyes up and faints.  The cultists
     FIRE their weapons into the air and cheer as the
     building-high stacks of wrecked cars surrounding
     them HONK their HORNS and FLASH their LIGHTS.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

     Headlights as Jesse's car zooms past a sign that
     reads: CRYSTAL LAKE - 13 MILES.

                    JESSE
               (V.O.)
          We're almost there...

                    MEAGAN
               (V.O.)
          We should pull over and ask
          directions.

                    STORMIE
               (V.O.)
          If it doesn't offend the men...
          ooops, sorry! There aren't any.

                    JESSE
               (V.O.)
          Very funny.


     EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

     Jesse pulls the car into an ol' run-down service
     station.

                    STORMIE
          I don't think they're open.

                    MEAGAN
          It says, open all night.

     Jesse HONKS the horn and yells:

                    JESSE
          Hey! Can we get some service out
          here?!

                    STORMIE
          I don't think there's anybody
          here...

     Suddenly, a CRAZY OL' COOT appears on the opposite
     side with a shotgun.  Everyone in the car jumps.

                    CRAZY OL' COOT
          What do you kids want?

                    MEAGAN
          We're looking for the old cemetery
          that's supposed to be around here...
          somewhere.

                    CRAZY OL' COOT
          What do you want to know for?

                    STORMIE
          We want to see it.

                    CRAZY OL' COOT
          Ain't nothin' to see, girly...
          'cept a bunch of ol' graves.

                    JESSE
          Look, mister... can you give us
          directions or not?

     The old man gives the occupants of the car a going
     over with his one good eye, hesitating a moment over
     Erwin, who scrunches down in the back seat, hiding
     under a baseball cap.

                    CRAZY OL' COOT
          You're not goin' up there to do
          somethin' stupid, are you?

                    JESSE
               (laughs; nervous)
          Stupid? Like what?

                    CRAZY OL' COOT
          Like dig up Jason Voorhees --
          that's what!

     Everyone in the car takes a sharp breath -- cold
     busted!  Then they start saying "No! No!" and shaking
     their heads innocently in a big performance that
     wouldn't fool a stick.

                    JESSE
               (looks at Meagan)
          Jesus... why would anyone do that?

                    CRAZY OL' COOT
          I dunno... but people do.

                    STORMIE
          Been dug up a few times already,
          has he?

                    CRAZY OL' COOT
          More times than I care to remember.

                    MEAGAN
          Well, we're just doing an article
          for our high school newspaper about
          the dangers of breaking into
          cemeteries at night. You know,
          stuff that can get you hurt...

     The ol' coot scans the foursome again closely as he
     acquiesces.

                    CRAZY OL' COOT
          Well... okay... as long as you're
          not going up there to do something
          stupid.
               (pointing)
          Take this road up about a mile and
          make a left at the ol' saw mill.
          That road will take you right on
          in... Eternal Peace Cemetery --
          can't miss it.

     Jesse is already standing on the gas, leaving the
     ol' coot standing in a cloud of smoke and dust.


     EXT. ETERNAL PEACE CEMETERY - NIGHT

     Headlights skew across a rusty iron gateway -- ETERNAL
     PEACE CEMETERY -- illuminating a sign: TRESPASSERS
     WILL BE SHOT!

     Meagan, Jesse, Stormie, and Erwin enter the shadowy
     cemetery carrying lamps with shovels over their
     shoulders.  As they search through the cemetery,
     Meagan asks:

                    MEAGAN
          What's the story on Jason Voorhees
          anyway?

                    STORMIE
          Where have you been? Jason was that
          guy who ran around in a hockey mask,
          chopping up camp counselors, duh?

                    MEAGAN
          I knew that. What I mean was why?

                    ERWIN
          It started a long time ago, back in
          the fifties, when Jason drown at
          Camp Crystal Lake. His mother went
          berserk and started killing the
          counselors.

                    STORMIE
          She got her head chopped off by one
          of the girls she was trying to kill!

                    ERWIN
          Right. And then Jason came back from
          his watery grave to get revenge.

                    JESSE
          He came back from the grave?

                    ERWIN
          Yeah. Chopped up a number of people
          before they finally caught up to him.

                    MEAGAN
          What happened to him then?

                    ERWIN
          They killed him.

                    JESSE
          How can you kill somebody who's
          back from the grave?

                    ERWIN
          Not very well apparently. Jason
          keeps coming back to life and
          chopping people up. It's a never
          ending cycle of terror up here at
          Crystal Lake -- a real problem.

                    MEAGAN
          Why does he keep coming back to
          life and killing people?

                    ERWIN
          They say he's looking for revenge
          on the camp counselor who murdered
          him as a child. Jason just happens
          to go about it in the socially
          unacceptable way of hacking through
          every teenager he finds until he
          gets the right one.
               (spots grave)
          Here it is...

     Erwin shines his light on Jason's grave.

     ANGLE ON TOMBSTONE -- JASON VOORHEES. Born:1945.
     Died:1953.

     Beneath the death date, crudely scratched into the
     stone: 1981, 1982, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1988, etc.

     Jesse and Erwin start digging.

     ELLIPSIS -- cemetery statues watching them dig.
     Stormie and Meagan take their turn.  Then... Jesse
     hits something solid.

     Hands brush away the remaining dirt, exposing the
     coffin below.  Jesse takes a sharp breath and then
     jams a crowbar under the lid -- forcing it open.

     The casket lid cracks open a bit when -- SSSSSS! --
     noxious gas escapes.  Everyone covers their mouth
     and nose, suppressing the urge to hurl.

     Then roaches... hundreds of roaches.

     Meagan and Stormie run off, screaming, batting at
     their hair and clothing.  Jesse rolls around on
     the ground.  Erwin sighs, plucks a roach off his
     shirt, and calmly eats it.

                         CUT TO:

     EXT. ETERNAL PEACE CEMETERY - A SHORT TIME LATER

     Meagan and Stormie stand just outside the grave,
     holding the light and a can of bug spray.  Their
     hair is up, covered in plastic shower caps.  Duct
     tape around the cuffs of their pants.  They aren't
     taking anymore chances with bugs.

     Jesse and Erwin open the casket.  Everyone recoils
     at the stench.  Then they shine their lights inside
     -- nothing but rotting chunks and a broken hockey
     mask.

                         CUT TO:

     The kids putting several plastic trash bags full of
     Jason into the trunk of Jesse's car and slamming
     the lid closed.

     Everyone piles into the car, exhausted.

     In the back, Erwin picks his nose, unaware that
     Stormie is watching him, her mouth gaping in horror.
     Erwin becomes aware of Stormie's sickened scrutiny
     and pulls out his finger, presenting it to Stormie.

                    ERWIN
          Look... the boogerman!
               (laughs)
          Get it?!

     Stormie slaps his hand away.

                    STORMIE
          Get back, you nasty-ass bastard!
          Ug! I thought I had seen the last
          of those when my brother graduated
          third grade!

                    ERWIN
          We just dug up a rotting corpse and
          you're worried about a little snot.

     Jesse looks over at Meagan, curled up in a ball
     beside him.  She purrs:

                    MEAGAN
          I'm exhausted... wake me when we
          get back home.

                    ERWIN
          Uhhh... better not fall asleep --
          we've still got a lot of work to
          do and Freddy's out there... waiting.

     This news sobers everyone up immediately.

                    STORMIE
          Well, that means we've all got to
          stay awake!

                    JESSE
          Duh?!

                    MEAGAN
          I know! We'll sing a song!
               (starts singing)
          Row! Row! Row your boat, gently down
          the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily,
          merrily... life is but a dream. Come
          on, everybody!

     Meagan leads the none-too-enthusiastic group in another
     chorus of "Row Your Boat" as Jesse's car roars off into
     the night.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. LONELY ROAD - NIGHT

     Meagan is leaning up against the door, murmuring softly
     to herself as she drifts off to sleep:

                    MEAGAN
          ...merrily, merrily, merrily,
          merrily... life is but a dream.

     In the back seat, Erwin is nuzzled between Stormie's
     breasts, sucking his thumb.  Both are fast asleep.

     Jesse stares at the road ahead, his own eyelids
     drooping.  The car starts to weave.

     ANGLE OUT WINDSHIELD -- we flash past Freddy holding
     a cardboard sign by the side of the road: WILL KILL
     FOR FOOD.

     Jesse shakes his head -- nah!  He tries to concentrate
     on the road, his eyelids falling once more.

     Jesse's car zooms past a billboard.  Behind the bill-
     board -- a highway patrol car, a radar gun sticking
     out of the driver's window.

     CLOSE ON RADAR GUN as Jesse's car passes in the back-
     ground, the red digits cascading up.

     Freddy, now dressed as a highway patrolman, sits behind
     the wheel.  The radar gun's display is reflected in
     his mirrored shades.  It reads: KILL THEM.

                    FREDDY
          Shouldn't dream and drive.

     Freddy starts the car and pulls out, but what comes
     out from behind the billboard isn't a patrol car --
     it's Freddy's NIGHTMAREMOBILE -- big chrome pipes
     belching HELLFIRE.

     ANGLE IN JESSE'S REARVIEW MIRROR as Jesse's eyelids
     close and his head nods forward, revealing the night-
     maremobile closing from behind fast.

     The nightmaremobile runs up to the back of Jesse's
     car just an inch from the bumper.  Freddy moves one
     of the dozen of levers on the dash.

     CLOSE ON FREDDY'S HOOD ORNAMENT -- a small version
     of Freddy's glove.  It extends out towards the back
     of Jesse's car, one of the tiny knives inserting into
     the trunk lock and turning with a slight CLICK. The
     trunk lid opens.

     ANGLE INSIDE TRUNK -- the plastic bags with Jason's
     remains are moving!  Freddy works another level and
     the tiny glove slits each bag.  The various pieces
     of Jason (hands, boots, intestines, etc.) crawl out
     of the bag.

                    FREDDY
               (continuing)
          Looks like the cat's out of the
          bag now!

     Freddy laughs as the tiny hand closes the trunk.

     The nightmaremobile pulls out from behind Jesse's
     car, BANGING into the rear quarter panel. WHAM! --
     all four occupants of the car are jolted awake,
     startled.  Meagan looks out her window and sees the
     nightmaremobile as it closes in again.

                    MEAGAN
          It's Freddy!

     WHAM!  SPARKS fly.  Everyone screams.  Freddy laughs
     as he falls back for another shot.  Meagan sees the
     dozens of lost souls trapped in the back of the night-
     maremobile, staring out at her through the back window.
     A small yellow sign reads:  LOST SOULS ON BOARD.

     Jesse fights to keep the car on the road when suddenly,
     the pieces of Jason ATTACK, BURSTING from behind the
     back seat.  One hand crawls up the back of the front
     seat, leaping onto Jesse's throat.  Jason's intestines
     EXPLODE out of the backseat, SLITHERING and SNAKING
     their way around Stormie and Erwin.  One of Jason's
     boots wiggles under the seat, making it's way towards
     the gas peddle.  The other boot is content to lay
     under the back window and kick Erwin in the head.

     As Meagan fights to pull Jason's hand of Jesse's face,
     she looks down and sees Jason's other hand between
     her legs.  Meagan screams.

     Jason's boot stomps on the gas and Jesse's car lurches
     forward with the acceleration. The nightmaremobile
     SLAMS into the side of Jesse's car again, causing it
     to swerve violently from side to side.

     Inside the nightmaremobile, Freddy pulls another lever.

     CLOSE ON THE NIGHTMAREMOBILE FENDER as a panel opens
     up and a circular sawblade arm extends out, CUTTING
     into Jesse's car with a flurry of SPARKS.  Inside,
     Meagan screams as the saw blade just misses her leg,
     CUTTING forward towards...

     CLOSE ON JESSE'S FRONT TIRE as the saw blade CUTS into
     it.  The tire BLOWS and Jesse's car lurches off the
     road, veering into a tree line.

     CRASH! -- Jesse's car plows fender-first into a tree,
     the HORN stuck on, BLARING.

     Freddy laughs and kicks the nightmaremobile into
     overdrive, ROARING OFF and disappearing with an
     EXPLOSION of FIRE that wisps away in an instant.

     In the distance -- an old farmhouse.  The lights go
     on inside.

     The passenger door opens and Meagan falls out onto the
     ground, bleeding from a slight scalp wound.  A rear
     door opens and Stormie and Erwin spill out, locked in
     embrace and not seriously hurt.  Meagan staggers
     around to the driver's side and opens the door.  Jesse
     is laying unconscious against the steering wheel.
     Meagan pulls him off the wheel and the HORN stops.
     Jesse is splattered with blood and his leg is a mess.

                    MEAGAN
               (continuing)
          Jesse's hurt real bad... we've got
          to get him to a doctor.

     Through the farmhouse window, Erwin and Stormie see
     the farmer on the phone.

                    ERWIN
          Don't worry... an ambulance is on
          the way.

     Meagan cradles Jesse's head in her hands, crying:

                    MEAGAN
          Oh, God... Jesse...

     Erwin goes to the trunk and opens it.  Inside -- the
     garbage bags with Jason's remains still inside --
     untouched.  Erwin goes to Meagan and says:

                    ERWIN
          Meagan... listen to me... The cops
          are on their way. If they find me
          and Jason Voorhees in the trunk
          there, we're finished.

                    MEAGAN
          Go... get out of here. Take Jason
          and Stormie with you.

                    STORMIE
          I'm staying with you.

     Erwin grabs the trash bags out of the trunk and says:

                    ERWIN
          I'll call you at the hospital.

                    STORMIE
          How?

                    ERWIN
          Somehow!

     Erwin takes off, disappearing with Jason's remains
     into the night as SIRENS WAIL in the distance --
     growing close.

                         CUT TO:

     INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Jesse is laying in a hospital bed, his leg in a
     special tent.  Meagan and Stormie watch from the
     doorway as a DOCTOR checks Jesse's vitals.  As he
     finishes, Meagan asks:

                    MEAGAN
          Is he going to be okay?

                    DOCTOR
          Yes. But he needs a lot of rest.
          His leg is broken in four places
          and he has four broken ribs and a
          concussion.

     Meagan sits down next to Jesse, taking his hand.
     Stormie turns to the doctor.

                    STORMIE
          Hey doc, is there someplace I
          could get us something to eat?

                    DOCTOR
          I'm afraid the cafeteria is closed.
          There are some vending machines in
          the lobby.
               (to Meagan)
          I'll be back to check on him in a
          couple of hours.

     The doctor exits.

                    STORMIE
          I'll be right back... I'm goin' go
          score us some munchies.

     Meagan nods weakly.  Stormie exits.  Meagan lays her
     head on Jesse's hand.


     INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

     Stormie is getting several bags of munchies out of
     the vending machine when she turns and sees Murdoch
     at the information booth, flashing photos of Jesse
     and Erwin.

     Stormie dashes for the staircase.


     INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - SAME TIME

     Jesse and Meagan have fallen asleep.  Jesse's heart
     monitor BEEPS...

     On the wall, an x-ray viewer flickers to life.  Freddy
     peeks out from behind the other side.  He snickers and
     ducks back down.

     Suddenly, Freddy's hand reaches up from inside the bed
     and grabs Jesse, pulling him down into the mattress.

     Meagan wakes and sees this, screaming as Jesse grabs
     onto the curtain.

     CLOSE ON CURTAIN ROD as the curtain pulls free of
     the rings.

     Jesse disappears into the bed, his screams echoing
     away.

     Meagan looks under the bed -- nothing.  She rises up
     again, watching as Jesse's iv and electrode wires
     are pulled down after him.  Meagan grabs a handful
     of tubes and wire and tries to pull Jesse back.  But
     the pull is too strong and Meagan goes into the
     mattress.


     INT. OLD WEST SALOON (NIGHTMARE) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Meagan falls to the floor of a dusty ol' saloon.  As
     she gets to her feet she sees Jesse's iv tubes running
     along the floor and out the door.  Meagan follows
     them to the saloon door, where she stops and looks
     out into...


     EXT. OLD WEST STREET (NIGHTMARE) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Standing in the middle of the street is Jesse, dressed
     in a cowboy sheriff's outfit complete with hat, badge,
     and gunbelt.

     Meagan calls to him from the saloon door.

                    MEAGAN
          Jesse!

     But Jesse can't hear her.  He's too busy shaking with
     fear... staring at something coming down the street.

     It's Freddy.  Dressed in a Black Bart cowboy outfit.

                    FREDDY
               (ala John Wayne)
          Okay, Sheriff... This nightmare
          ain't big enough for the two of
          us... draw!

     Trembling with fear, Jesse fumbles for his pistol.
     He pulls it out and FIRES.  Freddy laughs.  Jesse
     FIRES again.  Freddy just laughs.  Jesse FIRES again
     and again and again and Freddy just laughs and laughs
     and laughs.  From the saloon, Meagan screams:

                    MEAGAN
          Jesse! Wake up! Wake up!!

     Freddy looks over at her, annoyed.

                    FREDDY
          Three's a crowd, bitch! Why don't
          you just go get [BEEP]


     INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     The SOUND of Jesse's heart monitor BEEPING erratically
     wakes Meagan with a start.  She tries to wake Jesse.

                    MEAGAN
          Jesse, wake up! WAKE UP!!


     INT. OLD WEST STREET (NIGHTMARE) - SAME TIME

     Jesse keeps FIRING at Freddy... until his gun CLICKS
     empty.  Freddy smiles and pulls out the biggest Goddamn
     gun you ever saw and says:

                    FREDDY
          Go ahead... make my dream!

     Freddy FIRES!

                         HARD CUT TO:

     INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - NEXT INSTANT

     Jesse's stomach EXPLODES with BLOOD -- splattering
     Meagan.  Jesse's heart monitor BEEPS continuously --
     flat line.  Jesse is dead.

     A NURSE shows up to answer the alarm.  She sees
     Meagan standing over Jesse's body, covered in blood,
     and screams.

     Stormie enters the room a half-second later and
     gasps.

                    MEAGAN
          Freddy killed Jesse...

     Stormie reaches in and grabs Meagan, pulling her out
     of the room.


     INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Stormie drags a shell-shocked Meagan down the hall,
     the screams of the nurse fading into the distance.

                    STORMIE
          Jesus... get a grip, lady. You'd
          think a nurse in a hospital would
          have seen a dead body before.

                    MEAGAN
          Jesse...

     Just then, Stormie spots Murdoch and his men getting
     off the elevator.  They hear the nurse's screams and
     come running towards Jesse's room.  Stormie pulls
     Meagan behind the nurse's station just as Murdoch
     and company go thundering past.

     Then a VOICE on the P.A. says:

                    VOICE
               (filtered)
          Attention. Would Meagan or Stormie
          please pick up the white paging
          phone for a message?

     Stormie and Meagan exchange worrisome looks.  The
     announcement repeats itself again.  Then again.
     Stormie can't stand it anymore -- she stands up
     and picks up the white paging phone.

                    STORMIE
               (into phone)
          This is Stormie...

     Murdoch and his men come running past the nurse's
     station again.  Stormie turns her back to them but
     Murdoch goes back to the nurse's station, asking:

                    MURDOCH
          Did you see a couple of girls go
          by here a moment ago?

     Stormie gestures to the elevators.

                    STORMIE
          Just missed 'em.

     Murdoch nods a quick thanks and takes off with his
     men right behind.  Stormie exhales a giant sigh of
     relief as the HOSPITAL OPERATOR says:

                    HOSPITAL OPERATOR
               (filtered)
          The message is from Erwin... he
          says to meet him at the side
          entrance in two minutes.

     Stormie hangs up and grabs Meagan, running for the
     staircase.


     EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

     Stormie drags Meagan out of the hospital just as
     Erwin pulls up in an old battered pick-up truck.
     He throws open the door and Stormie pushes Meagan
     inside, climbing in after her and asking:

                    STORMIE
          Where'd you get the truck?

                    ERWIN
          Same place I've got Jason hid.

                    STORMIE
          And where's that?

                    ERWIN
          A place where no one ever goes.

     Stormie closes the door and the pick-up truck ROARS
     out of the parking lot.

                         CUT TO:

     EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

     The pick-up truck's headlights skew across a weather-
     worn sign, peppered with bullet holes: CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

     Erwin drives the truck through the deserted camp,
     past the cabins, down towards the lake.  He stops a
     short distance away from the pier and the three of
     them climb out.

     Meagan is still in shock, letting Stormie guide her
     as Erwin leads them down the pier to a small diving
     platform tied up to the end.

                    STORMIE
          What'd you do -- take him for a
          swim?

                    ERWIN
          Almost.

     Erwin jumps down on the diving platform.  In the center,
     a large form is covered by a tarp.  Erwin helps Stormie
     down onto the platform, leaving Meagan standing on the
     pier.  She looks out over the lake -- eyes vacant.
     Erwin moves close to Stormie and, gesturing to Meagan,
     asks:

                    ERWIN
               (continuing)
          Is she going to be alright?

                    STORMIE
          I don't know. She's pretty fucked
          up. God, I don't know why I'm not...

                    ERWIN
          You're a strong woman.

                    STORMIE
          What's that supposed to mean?

                    ERWIN
          Uhhh... nothing. I didn't mean
          anything.

     Stormie gestures to the tarp.

                    STORMIE
          Is this him?

                    ERWIN
          Yeah...
               (whips back tarp)
          Meet the new and improved Jason.

     ANGLE ON JASON laying spread eagle on the diving
     platform, cocooned in chicken wire with dozens of
     coiled leads trailing off into the water.  Erwin has
     done a good job of sewing Jason back together with
     barbed wire and fishing line.  His arms and legs have
     been reinforced with steel braces and even Jason's
     mask has been repaired, stitched down the middle with
     bailing wire.  Jason looks nineties... and butch.

                    STORMIE
          Why'd you put that stupid mask
          on him?

                    ERWIN
          Take a look...

     Stormie bends down and takes a peek under the mask
     and quickly replaces it.

                    STORMIE
          Good idea.

                    ERWIN
          Not exactly a beauty queen entry,
          is he?

                    STORMIE
          So what do we do now -- sing an Ozzy
          Osbourne song backwards or something?

                    ERWIN
          I'm afraid it's not that simple...

                    STORMIE
          I thought you said you knew how to
          bring him back to life?

                    ERWIN
          I do! But when I was putting him
          back together, I noticed something
          was missing.

     Stormie thinks about this for a second, then:

                    STORMIE
          Awwww, he won't be needing that...
          I mean, what girl would let him
          put his rotten ol'...

                    ERWIN
               (cuts her off)
          No-no! Not that! It's his heart...
          it's missing.

                    STORMIE
          Well... does it really matter?
          Can't you use an aquarium pump or
          something?

                    ERWIN
          No... he has to have a heart. A
          human heart. A good one.

     Meagan speaks for the first time:

                    MEAGAN
          I know where we can get a heart...
          A good one.

                         CUT TO:

     EXT. MORGUE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     A sign reads: CITY MORGUE.  Through the front window
     a GUARD can be seen sitting at the reception desk.
     Erwin, Stormie, and Meagan watch him from the pick-up,
     parked a safe distance away.

                    ERWIN
          That guard in there might pose a
          problem.

                    MEAGAN
          Do you think you and Stormie could
          keep him occupied for a few minutes?

     Erwin and Stormie exchange looks, then shrug -- why
     not?

                    MEAGAN
               (continuing)
          Okay... let's do it.

     A few moments later, the guard looks up as the pick-
     up swerves wildly into the parking lot.  He gets up
     and goes to the glass door, peering out.

     ANGLE THROUGH GLASS DOOR as Stormie and Erwin start
     making out -- hot and heavy.


     INT. MORGUE - NIGHT

     Meagan BREAKS a small window near the ceiling. She
     crawls onto the top of the cabinet and then drops
     to the floor.  She shines her flashlight around the
     dark laboratory, illuminating anatomy charts, jars
     full of organs, etc.

     Crossing to the lockers, Meagan tentatively opens
     one of the drawers and shines her light inside --
     ug!  Wrong guy.  She opens the next drawer -- ick!
     Even worse.

     Meagan opens a third drawer -- Jesse.  Her lip starts
     to quiver as she caresses his face.


     EXT. MORGUE - PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

     At the glass door, the guard is watching the action
     in the parking lot, his breath fogging the window.
     He wipes the glass clean with his sleeve to get a
     better look.

     Inside the truck, Stormie and Erwin wrestle around.

                    STORMIE
          Hey! Watch that!

                    ERWIN
          I'm just trying to make it look real.

                    STORMIE
          Just keep your hands above the bra,
          pizza face.

     The windows are starting to steam up.


     INT. MORGUE - SAME TIME

     Meagan pulls on a labcoat and puts on a pair of rubber
     gloves.  Then she opens a drawer full of shiny instru-
     ments (saws, rib cutters, etc.) and selects a large
     knife.

     Meagan stands over Jesse's body.  She pulls back the
     sheet, exposing his chest.  Meagan raises the knife
     far above her head.

                    MEAGAN
          Forgive me, Jesse...

     Meagan plunges the knife into Jesse's chest with a
     sickening THWACK!


     EXT. MORGUE - PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

     The windows of the pick-up are now badly fogged,
     obscuring the guard's view.  He licks his lips,
     deciding to investigate closer.  The guard unlocks
     the front door and starts toward Stormie and Erwin.
     They spot him coming and break their embrace.  In
     another moment, the pick-up is PEELING out of the
     parking lot.  The guard watches the truck go, shakes
     his head, and goes back inside to start his rounds.

     Up the street, parked with the lights off in the night
     shade of a large tree, Stormie and Erwin watch as the
     guard starts down the glass enclosed hallway towards
     the morgue.

                    STORMIE
          He's head right for her! Do some-
          thing!

     Erwin panics for a moment, then HONKS the HORN.


     INT. MORGUE - NEXT MOMENT

     Meagan is trying to pull Jesse's heart out of his
     chest but it just won't come, some vein or muscle
     fiber keeps pulling it back.  She jumps at the HORN,
     then starts pulling harder.

     In the hallway just outside, the guard hears the HORN
     and stops.  He starts back for the front, when suddenly
     the HORN stops.

     Meagan hacks at the last bits of stringy goo that cling
     to Jesse's heart.  As the last strand goes, Meagan
     tumbles backwards to the floor with a loud THUD.

     The guard hears that and turns back towards the morgue,
     drawing his gun.  He tip-toes to the door and carefully
     unlocks it, leaving his keys in the lock.  Taking a
     two-handed Weaver stance, the guard raises his foot
     and kicks the door.

     WHACK! -- the door flies open and the guard leaps
     inside like Marshall Dillon, snapping on the lights.
     He gasps, eyes going wide as he scans the room.  One
     of the drawers is open... the stiff's chest has got
     a huge hole in it... blood spattered everywhere...
     a bunch of bloody footprints leading over to the
     cabinet...

     Suddenly, the guard sees Meagan half out the window
     and cries:

                    GUARD
          Stop right there!

     Meagan rolls out of the window just as the guard FIRES.
     The unbroken section of the window SHATTERS.  The guard
     curses and races for the...


     EXT. MORGUE - SECONDS LATER

     The guard comes running out just in time to see Meagan
     close the passenger door and the truck ROAR away.  He
     shrinks, dejected -- no way to catch them now.  The
     guard heads back inside to report this mess and finds
     that the door has closed and locked behind him.

                         CUT TO:

     EXT. ETERNAL PEACE CEMETERY - NIGHT

     The crazy ol' coot is leading Murdoch through the
     cemetery.

                    CRAZY OL' COOT
          They said they were writin' for
          some newspaper...

                    MURDOCH
          Teenagers are notorious liars.

                    CRAZY OL' COOT
          Well, after I heard about the
          accident on my police scanner, I
          came up here to have a look. When
          I found it I figured you'd want to
          know right away.

                    MURDOCH
          You did the right thing.

     The ol' coot shines his light down into Jason's empty
     grave.

                    CRAZY OL' COOT
          Damn kids... I just knew they were
          comin' up here to do somethin'
          stupid.

     The S.W.A.T. commander comes up to Murdoch.

                    S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
          Just got a call on the radio --
          three juveniles just broke into the
          morgue -- one male, two female. The
          guard is pretty sure the male is in
          the Freddy cult -- burnt face.

                    CRAZY OL' COOT
          Sounds like the same kids I saw.

                    MURDOCH
          Did the guard say what they took?

                    S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
          Yeah... that murdered kid, Jesse --
          they carved his heart out.
               (beat)
          They got away in a pick-up -- the
          guard didn't get the license. You
          want me to put out an A.P.B.?

                    MURDOCH
          No... that won't be necessary. I
          know just where they're going, and
          just what they're up to. And this
          time... I'll be ready.

                         CUT TO:

     EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

     Meagan sits on the end of the pier, watching silently
     as Erwin sews Jesse's heart into Jason's chest using
     dental floss.  Stormie comes up behind her and puts
     her jacket around Meagan's shoulders, sits down beside
     her and says:

                    STORMIE
          You've got to quit blaming your-
          self for what happened to Jesse...
          it wasn't your fault.

                    MEAGAN
          He didn't want to come with us...
          but he did anyway. He did it for me.

                    STORMIE
          I'm not sorry I came... I don't
          think Jesse would be, either.

                    MEAGAN
          I just can't believe he's dead. I
          keep thinking he'll show up any
          minute...

                    ERWIN
          Well, that just about does it...

     Erwin finishes sewing up Jason and climbs back onto
     the pier, cutting the diving platform free.  He kicks
     it off and it floats out into the lake, drifting free.
     Then Erwin herds the girls down the shore, leading
     them over to where a short trench has been dug leading
     from the water's edge.

     In the bottom of the trench -- an uncovered power
     cable.

                    ERWIN
               (continuing)
          As you can see, I've excavated the
          power cable that runs across the
          bottom of Crystal Lake. I've cut
          away the insulation, exposing a
          patch of cable right near the water's
          edge.

     Erwin picks up a nearby bucket of water and sets it
     at the head of the trench.

                    ERWIN
               (continuing)
          Now when I kick this over, the water
          will wash down the trench and bridge
          an eletrical gap between the cable
          and the lake. There's plenty of
          voltage, so it should work.

                    STORMIE
          So you kick the bucket and Jason
          lives.

                    ERWIN
          Yeah, right...
               (then)
          Okay, keep your fingers crossed...

     Erwin kicks the bucket over.  The water washes down
     the trench, over the cable, and -- POW! Z-Z-Z-ZAP!
     A huge SPARK HITS EXPLODES.  Then the lake begins to
     glow and the water begins to churn.  Erwin and the
     girls jump back as ELECTRICITY ARCS from the lake,
     engulfing the diving platform.

     The ARCS of ELECTRICITY leap from the chicken wire
     onto Jason's body, his massive frame convulsing.

     CLOSE ON HOCKEY MASK as we PUSH IN -- the electricity
     spirals down into the eye hole like water running
     down a drain.

     CLOSE ON JASON'S EYE as it opens!  We dive into the
     eye and take a fantastic dream/time travel to...

                         OPTICAL TRANSITION TO:

     EXT. VOORHEES CABIN - 1953 - DAY

     CLOSE ON MASK (1950's version of a hockey mask)
     reflected in the water.  A young hand reaches up and
     pulls off the mask, revealing the disfigured boy
     beneath.  This is JASON -- AGE 9.

     JASON'S FATHER comes to the doorway of their run-
     down cabin in dirty longjohns, holding a bottle of
     rye. He bellows:

                    JASON'S FATHER
          Jason! Git your ass over here!

     Jason jumps at his father's voice, hesitates only
     slightly, then runs toward him, stopping abruptly
     several paces away.

                    JASON'S FATHER
               (continuing)
          What did I teach you, boy? Don't
          ever take your mask off out in
          public. I don't want nobody to see
          that ugly mug of yours.

     Jason stands, looking at his bare feet. His father
     smacks him upside the head, shoving him towards the
     woodshed.

                    JASON'S FATHER
               (continuing)
          Go git in the woodshed.

     Jason's pace slows as he enters the dark shed -- he
     knows what's coming next.

                    JASON'S FATHER
               (continuing)
          Drop them overalls and lay over
          them logs...

     Jason slowly complies as his father loosens his belt.
     Suddenly, JASON'S MOTHER is just outside the doorway,
     calling:

                    JASON'S MOTHER
          Jason! Come here!

     Jason gives his father a sideways glance, then scurries
     towards his mother.

                    JASON'S FATHER
          What are you doing woman?

     Jason's mother gives him a mason jar stuffed with
     dollars and change.

                    JASON'S MOTHER
          I saved up some money... I want
          you to take and go on up to that
          summer camp just up the road. Tell
          the man you want to stay there.

                    JASON'S FATHER
          Just what the hell do you think
          you're doing, bitch?!

                    JASON'S MOTHER
          I'm sending him away for a few weeks.

                    JASON'S FATHER
          You ain't sending him nowhere.
               (to Jason)
          Bring me that money, boy!

     Jason holds his ground for a second, unsure whom to
     obey, when his mother shoos him away.

                    JASON'S MOTHER
          Go on now... go!

     Jason takes off up the road.  His father sneers:

                    JASON'S FATHER
          Goin' ag'in me? I'll take you to
          the shed, woman!

     Jason's mother pulls a knife from her apron.

                    JASON'S MOTHER
          You ain't ever taking anyone to
          the shed ever again.

     Jason's mother charges at her husband, shoving him
     back into the shed with the knife.  Jason looks back.
     Through the open window he sees his mother's arm
     coming down repeatedly with the knife, his father's
     arms flailing helplessly.  Then both disappear from
     view.  After a moment his mother appears in the door-
     way, spattered with blood.  She smiles and waves to
     him, calling:

                    JASON'S MOTHER
               (continuing)
          Go on, son... have a good time!
          Mommy will come and git you some
          day soon!

     Jason turns and runs to...


     EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - 1953 - DAY

     Wearing his mask, Jason walks through the entrance
     to the camp with his jar of money.

     In the office, the HEAD COUNSELOR takes his money
     and shakes his hand.

                    HEAD COUNSELOR
          Welcome aboard, son! I'm sure
          you'll have a great time!

                         CUT TO:

     The other KIDS dance around Jason, taunting him...
     laughing at him... pointing and teasing... Jason
     breaks away, running towards the pier.

     Jason sits at the end of the pier, looking at his own
     reflection.  He removes the mask and watches as the
     distortions in the water make his face look normal.

     Someone comes up behind Jason slowly.  Jason isn't
     aware of their presence until a shadowy reflection
     appears behind his own.  Jason turns to see who when
     he is suddenly pushed into the lake.

     Jason splashes to the surface, sputtering, trying to
     stay afloat.  A hand pushes his head back under the
     water.

     JASON'S UNDERWATER P.O.V. -- a distorted image of
     whoever is holding him under.

     Jason thrusts out his arms, fighting to get back to
     the surface... fighting just to see who is killing
     him before he dies.

                         HARD CUT TO:

     EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

     Jason comes alive, thrashing around on the diving dock,
     the electricity all over him like a spider web. On
     shore, Erwin and the girls gasp.

                    ERWIN
          Holy shit! It worked!

     Meagan and Stormie bounce, excitedly.  But something
     is wrong.  Jason thrashes around on the dock, unable
     to break the crisscross of high voltage chicken wire.

                    MEAGAN
          It's kill him! Shut it off! Shut
          it off!

                    ERWIN
          Shut it off... it suddenly occurs
          to me that I hadn't really planned
          for that contingency.

                    STORMIE
          Just don't stand there! Do something!

     But all Erwin can do is scratch his head.  Meagan
     rushes to the shore line and screams out over the lake:

                    MEAGAN
          Jason! JASON! You've got to get up!
          Do you hear me? Get up!

     Jason clenches his meaty fists and SLAMS them down
     against the diving dock. SMASHING it to bits.  Water
     rushes over him and -- ZZZZT! KA-POW!

     A power transformer on shore EXPLODES, causing Meagan
     and her friends to cringe.  When they look back, the
     electrical light show fades away, leaving nothing but
     smoke and floating debris.  Meagan and Stormie turn to
     Erwin, who shrugs shyly and says:

                    ERWIN
          Well... it's off now.

     Meagan and Stormie begin a verbal barrage that would
     shrink any man to pus... much less Erwin.  He cowers
     between them, offering quick excuses and humble
     apologies.

     All three are so wrapped up in laying blame that they
     never notice Jason's shadowy figure as it rises from
     the lake.

     Then they do see him... scream and run.  Jason charges
     after the kids in his familiar "unstoppable killer"
     gait.

     Erwin ducks inside the tool shed as Meagan and Stormie
     dash past.  He closes the door behind him and squirms
     out a tiny window just as Jason kicks open the door
     and steps inside.  Erwin races around to the front
     and closes the door.  He fastens the latch and padlock,
     then calls to the girls:

                    ERWIN
               (continuing)
          Hey! Come back! I've got him locked
          up in the tool shed!

     Just then, the SOUND of a CHAINSAW as the blade RIPS
     through the tool shed door.  Erwin screams like a
     girl and runs away.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Meagan and Stormie run into the main room.  Stormie
     spots a phone and goes to it, dialing frantically.

                    MEAGAN
          Who are you calling?!

                    STORMIE
          The cops! Who else?!

                    MEAGAN
          Are you kidding?! They'll lock us
          up and throw away the key!

                    STORMIE
          Fine by me!
               (clicks the receiver)
          Damnit! It's dead!

     Just then, Erwin bursts into the cabin, slamming
     the door shut behind him.

                    ERWIN
          He's right behind me!

     Stormie and Meagan look out the window -- sure enough,
     Jason is storming towards them, holding the chainsaw.

                    STORMIE
               (to Erwin)
          You're the one who brought him
          back to life!

                    ERWIN
          And?!

                    STORMIE
          Well, do something!

     Erwin screams and runs for the closet, hiding inside.
     Stormie clucks:

                    STORMIE
               (continuing)
          Oh, some hero!

     Just then, the chainsaw RIPS through the front door.
     Meagan and Stormie scream and follow Erwin into the
     closet, closing themselves inside.

     They cower in the closet, listening... for a long
     moment... nothing but the sound of their heavy
     breathing.

     Then, with the RIPPING of WOOD, Jason chainsaws the
     closet door -- knocking it to the floor.  Erwin draws
     out his pin and starts stabbing himself in the finger.

     Jason charges forward, when Meagan suddenly stands
     up in front of him and yells:

                    MEAGAN
          STOP!

     To everyone's shock... Jason does.

                    MEAGAN
               (continuing)
          Now... just stop! We're the ones
          that brought you back to life.
          And you have no right to kill us
          with that chainsaw! In fact... you
          owe us...

                    STORMIE
          That's right! She gave you her
          boyfriend's heart, you know!

                    MEAGAN
          That's right.

     Jason cocks his massive head like a perplexed pup.

                    MEAGAN
               (continuing)
          Look! Here's his picture...

     Meagan takes off the necklace that Jesse gave her and
     opens the locket.  She shows Jason the photo of Jesse
     inside.  Jason drops the chainsaw and takes the locket
     in his humongous hands, gently touching the photo of
     Jesse with a meaty finger.

                    MEAGAN
               (continuing)
          Now, I know that you've been through
          a lot. And I know that you're pissed
          off about being murdered and all.

                    STORMIE
               (interjects)
          I know I would be!

                    MEAGAN
          But if you help us kill Freddy
          Krueger... I promise to help you
          find the little bastard that
          killed you. What do you say? Have
          we got a deal?

     Meagan sticks out her hand to shake.  Jason stares at
     it, looks back at the locket, then to Meagan. Finally,
     he reaches out his huge hand for Meagan's when...

     Brilliant, blinding white light blazes through the
     windows, freezing everyone to the spot.  Anxious to
     get out of the closet with Jason, Erwin crawls across
     the floor and peeks out over the window sill.

     ANGLE OUT WINDOW -- a dozen police cars shine their
     lights towards the cabin, two dozen COPS aim their
     weapons.  In the middle of this impressive show of
     force is Murdoch.  He raises a bullhorn to his lips.

                    MURDOCH
               (through bullhorn)
          You in there! This is Captain Renton
          Murdoch -- State Trooper! I am
          ordering you to come out with your
          hands up! I'll give you until the
          count of three...
               (beat)
          Three!

     Meagan turns to Jason, shoving him back into the
     closet.

                    MEAGAN
               (whispering)
          Jason, you have to hide! Stay in
          here and don't come out until we
          tell you. Stormie... help me!

     Stormie helps Meagan stuff Jason into the closet,
     closing the door.  Then they quickly smooth down
     their hair and clothes, moving towards the door.


     EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NEXT SECOND

     Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin come out with their hands
     raised high above their heads.  As they walk towards
     the police cars, several of the S.W.A.T. team moves
     in and arrests them.  As they are handcuffed and
     searched, Murdoch goes on the bullhorn again:

                    MURDOCH
               (through bullhorn)
          Alright... anybody else left in
          there had better say their prayers!

                    ERWIN
          There's no one else inside.

                    MURDOCH
          Is that a fact?
               (into bullhorn)
          Okay... you had your chance!

     Suddenly, one of the cops points towards the cabin
     and shouts:

                    COP
          Hey, look!

     All heads turn towards the cabin, where Jason's
     massive frame is filling the doorway.

                    S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
          Holy Mary, mother of God... would
          you look at the size of that guy?

                    MURDOCH
               (almost happy)
          I knew it!

     All the cops level their weapons at Jason when Murdoch
     suddenly steps forward, gesturing for everyone to get
     behind him.

                    MURDOCH
               (continuing)
          Stand back! I'll handle this.

     Murdoch takes a few steps towards the cabin and sneers:

                    MURDOCH
               (continuing)
          You...

     Jason raises the chainsaw -- he remembers Murdoch too.
     Murdoch goes for his gun, but instead of bringing out
     a pistol, he holds a laser designator.  Murdoch fires.

     A big red dot appears on Jason's chest.  Jason looks
     down at it like it was a harmless bug.  He looks back
     up at Murdoch, who raises a radio to his lips and says:

                    MURDOCH
               (continuing;
                     into radio)
          Let her go.


     EXT. 60,000 FEET ABOVE CRYSTAL LAKE - NEXT SECOND

     A military jet flying above drops it's payload -- a
     laser-guided napalm bomb.


     EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - SAME TIME

     A slight WHISTLE sound grows in the skies above Camp
     Crystal Lake.  Jason looks up.

     SMART BOMB P.O.V. as it drops down on Jason -- homing
     in on the laser dot on his chest.

     BA-BOOM! -- Camp Crystal Lake EXPLODES in flames.
     All the cops take cover as FIRE RAINS DOWN on them.
     Only Murdoch stands his ground, his arms outstretched
     as he embraces the terrible sight.

                    MURDOCH
          That'll teach you to fuck with the
          law, Voorhees!

     A cop behind him says:

                    COP
          Uhh, sir... your hat's on fire.

     Murdoch looks up -- sure enough, his Smokey Bear hat
     is burning above the brim.

     Meagan watches as Camp Crystal Lake is consume in
     flames, her last hope of saving Lizzy -- gone.  Then
     a cop shoves her into a police car with Stormie.
     Erwin is put into another car and the three exchange
     worrisome looks through the windows just before the
     cars pull away.

     As the cops start to pull out, one of them notices
     something moving amidst the flames -- a large BURNING
     form, walking towards the lake.  As it stumbles out
     onto the pier, the cop turns to his partner and says:

                    CURIOUS COP
          Hey... do you see that?

     But just then, the form falls through the BURNING
     pier, SPLASHING into the water below.  The partner
     looks, sees nothing, and shrugs.

                    PARTNER
          See what?

                    CURIOUS COP
          I thought I saw something...

     He shrugs it off and exits after his partner.

     Murdoch, his hat still smoking a little, surveys the
     sight one last time before climbing into his patrol
     car and driving away.

                         CUT TO:

     INT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - NIGHT

     A cell door SLAMS in front of Stormie's face. A cell
     door SLAMS in front of Meagan's face.  Both girls are
     behind bars, separated by a cement wall.  The hefty
     female DEPUTY in charge of the cellblock goes back to
     her desk.

     Both girls stand in their cells next to eachother,
     watching as the deputy goes back to her desk and
     begins to devour three combo-burritos.

                    MEAGAN
          We've got to try and stay awake.

                    STORMIE
          Getting something to eat might help.
               (calls to Deputy)
          Yo, Butch!

                    DEPUTY MILLER
          It's Deputy Miller.

                    STORMIE
          Excuse me, Deputy Miller but could
          we have something to eat?

                    DEPUTY MILLER
          I thought you psychos only ate
          human hearts?

                    STORMIE
          And I thought you pigs only ate
          donuts.

                    DEPUTY MILLER
          Don't make me come back there.

                    STORMIE
               (low; to Meagan)
          Cow! I hope she chokes on her three
          combo-burrito cud!

     Meagan leans up against the wall, sliding down to
     the floor in defeat.

                    MEAGAN
          What am I going to do? I'll never
          be able to find Lizzy now.

                    STORMIE
          You should be worrying about your-
          self... I know I am.

     Stormie plops down on her cot.

                    MEAGAN
          I bet you're sorry you came with
          me now...

                    STORMIE
          Nah... what are best friends for?
          Afterall, you stuck by me through
          all my crazy phases, I figure I
          owe you one big crazy phase, right?

                    MEAGAN
          That's for being my best friend,
          Stormie.

     Just then, Deputy Miller steps in front of Meagan's
     cell, unlocking it.

                    DEPUTY MILLER
          Come on, Meagan.

                    MEAGAN
          Where are we going?

                    DEPUTY MILLER
          Your parents are here.

                         CUT TO:

     INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

     Deputy Miller brings Meagan out of the cellblock,
     where her mom and dad are waiting with Captain Murdoch.
     Meagan's mom rushes up and hugs Meagan.

                    MEAGAN'S MOM
          Oh, Meagan... are you alright?
          Let me look at you...

                    MEAGAN
          I'm okay, mom.

                    MEAGAN'S DAD
          Your mother's been worried sick,
          Meagan. So have I.

     Meagan stands handcuffed, her hair mussed, her clothes
     bloody and soiled.

                    MEAGAN
          Sorry. Today has been a bitch.


     INT. CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

     The deputy is so busy munching down on her burritos
     that she doesn't notice the strange shadow that
     passes behind her.

     The shadow moves down the cellblock, accompanied by
     a slight SCRAPING.  Freddy's glove materializes,
     raking the knives along the metal cross bars.  Freddy
     stops at Stormie's cell, looking inside.

     Stormie is fast asleep.

     Freddy walks into Stormie's cell, passing right through
     the bars.  Suddenly, Stormie wakes and, seeing Freddy,
     jumps to her feet and screams.

                    STORMIE
          Help! Help! Freddy's here! He's here!

     But the deputy at the end of the cellblock doesn't
     respond, finishing off the rest of the burrito and
     licking her meaty fingers clean.  Freddy puts his
     forefinger knife to his lips and shushes Stormie,
     pointing to her cot.  Stormie looks over and sees her-
     self asleep.

                    STORMIE
               (continuing)
          Oh, shit! I'm still asleep!

     She looks up at Freddy, who smiles and says:

                    FREDDY
          You know what they say... when you
          sleep -- you die!

     Freddy flashes the glove of knives.


     INT. POLICE STATION - NEXT MOMENT


                    MEAGAN'S MOM
          Meagan, Captain Murdoch here said
          you helped one of those cultists
          escape from a hospital?

                    MEAGAN
          A mental hospital.

                    MEAGAN'S MOM
          And he said you desecrated a cemetery
          and some other really terrible things.
          Tell me you had nothing to do with
          it. Tell me there's some mistake...?

                    MEAGAN
          There's no mistake.
               (to Murdoch)
          What did you do with Erwin?

                    MURDOCH
          Your boyfriend is headed back to the
          looney bin where he belongs. But
          don't worry, you'll be seeing him
          soon enough... at the arraignment.


     INT. CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

     Freddy taunts Stormie as the circle around in the cell
     by slicing off his fingers, squirting green slime.
     Stormie winces a little but keeps her distance and cool.

                    STORMIE
          You don't scare me, Freddy! Thanks
          to my various phases and many hours
          of watching violent televison, I
          have become immune to violence. Seen
          it all and done it all! Nothing you
          do can gross me out -- so why don't
          you give it your best shot, bitch!

                    FREDDY
          Then maybe I'll just CUT to the chase!

     Freddy swings the glove but Stormie ducks, keeping her
     defensive stance.

                    STORMIE
          I'm warning you, Freddy... my father
          is a drill sergeant in the Marine
          Corps and he taught me just how to
          defend myself against slimy bastards
          like you.

                    FREDDY
          Oh I'm so scared, honey. Come on!
          Hit me! Punch me right in the nose!
          I dare you!

     Freddy juts out his chin, gesturing for Stormie to
     take a punch.  Stormie throws a right and pops Freddy
     right in the nose.

                    FREDDY
               (continuing;
                     surprised)
          Owwwww!

     Stormie smiles but that soon fades as she realizes her
     fist is stuck in Freddy's nose.  Freddy takes in a
     breath and Stormie's arm is sucked up past the elbow.
     She screams.

     Freddy takes a deep breath and snorts Stormie right
     up his nose, her screams turning into a faint BUZZ.
     Freddy smiles.

                    FREDDY
               (continuing)
          Now that's what I call getting a
          buzz.


     INT. FREDDY'S NOSTRIL CAVERN - NEXT SECOND

     Now the size of a flea, Stormie is clinging to one
     of hundreds of pointed tree trunks jutting out from
     the circular walls -- Freddy's nose hairs.  Stuck in
     those humongous hairs are clumps of icky gunk --
     boogers.

     Sitting next to Stormie, a particularly large and
     rotund booger clump opens its eyes and says (in the
     distorted voice of Harry Manfredini):

                    BOOGERMAN
          Hi there! I'm the Boogerman! Heh-
          heh... get it?

     Stormie screams, backing up into the "trees", trying
     to put distance between herself and Boogerman.

                    BOOGERMAN
               (continuing)
          Aww, don't go... we can play "Star
          Wars". You can be Princess Leia and
          I'll be Jabba the Hutt!

     Boogerman licks his fat, nasty lips with a slimy green
     tongue -- he does kinda look like Jabba.  Stormie
     screams again.


     INT. POLICE STATION - SAME TIME

     Meagan is getting more and more agitated.

                    MEAGAN
          We're wasting time! We've got to
          close down all the churches --
          Freddy has to marry Lizzy on holy
          ground!

     Meagan's parents stare at their daughter with confused,
     frightened looks.

                    MEAGAN
               (continuing)
          Don't you understand?! He has to
          come to our reality to do it! It's
          our last chance to kill him!

                    MURDOCH
          Okay, I think we've heard enough of
          this crap. Take her back to the
          lockup.

     A couple of DEPUTIES grab Meagan.  She throws them off
     and they grab her again, roughly.  Meagan's parents
     watch in pain and horror as the deputies drag their
     daughter back to her cell, kicking and screaming.

                    MEAGAN
          Dad! Mom! Don't let them lock me up!
          I have to save Lizzy!

                    MEAGAN'S MOM
          Oh, Meagan... you're sick. You don't
          even realize what you've done.

                    MEAGAN
          I did what I had to do to try and
          save Lizzy!

                    MURDOCH
          Yeah, including murdering your boy-
          friend and cutting his heart out.

                    MEAGAN
          Liar! Freddy killed Jesse! He was
          already dead when I cut his heart
          out!

     Meagan's mom and dad gasp, recoiling with horror.

                    MEAGAN
               (continuing; manic)
          Goddamnit, you don't understand!
          Freddy lives! FREDDY LIVES!!!

     Meagan's raving grows faint as she disappears into
     the cellblock.  Murdoch pulls Meagan's dad aside.

                    MURDOCH
          I know how you must feel... I had
          a dog once. I loved that dog. I
          treated her like my own daughter.
          We went camping, picnics in the
          park... I even had a little stocking
          for her nailed up on the mantle for
          Christmas. Then one day, she bit
          me... so I had to blow her brains
          out.
               (sighs)
          God, I loved that dog.


     INT. STORMIE'S CELL & NOSTRIL CAVERN - SAME TIME

     Freddy starts to dig in his nose with his forefinger
     knife.

     A giant knife blade comes charging up the nostril
     cavern, sending Stormie into hysterics.

                    BOOGERMAN
          Uh-oh, Freddy's picking his nose
          again -- gotta go!

     Boogerman starts lumbering up into the back of the
     nostril cavern.  Stormie watches the massive knife
     blade as it comes right for her, then at the last
     possible second she starts climbing after Boogerman.
     She pushes past the disgusting blob of goo, racing
     ahead.

                    BOOGERMAN
               (continuing)
          Well, excuse me!

     INSERT -- Freddy pushes the knife way far back into
     his head.

     The giant knife spears Boogerman in the back, running
     him through and spilling his "Boogerman" guts out his
     front.  Stormie gives a little squeal as Boogerman is
     pulled out, kicking and screaming.

     Freddy withdraws the knife from his nose, peering
     closely at the tiny Boogerman impaled on the end. He
     twists his mouth in utter disdain and flicks Booger-
     man across the cell.

     Boogerman screams as he flies across vast space, smack-
     ing into the far wall with a giant SPLAT! Boogerman
     flattens outwards into a thin pancake of Boogerman goo,
     his nasty head still alive in the center.

     Freddy reaches through the bars of the cell, his arm
     extending out in a grotesque fashion all the way to
     the deputy's desk.  He feels around on the table until
     he touches the pepper shaker, drawing it back into
     Stormie's cell.

     Freddy sprinkles a small amount of pepper into his
     right palm and breathes it in deeply -- the specks
     of pepper becoming rocks that pelt Stormie as she
     clings to life deep inside the nostril.

     Freddy's face begins to distort, his nose wrinkling
     up -- the beginnings of a sneeze.

                    FREDDY
          Ahhh... ahhh... ahhh--CHOO!

     Micro-Stormie comes blasting out of Freddy's nose
     with globules of snot.  She flies across the massive
     cell, headed directly for the splattered Boogerman,
     screaming her head off.

     Boogerman sees Stormie racing towards him and he
     screams too.

                         HARD CUT TO:

     INT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - NEXT INSTANT

     As the deputy brings Meagan back to her cell they
     hear a loud SPLAT!

                    MEAGAN
          Stormie?!

     The deputy pushes Meagan back as she moves forward
     cautiously, glancing around the wall into Stormie's
     cell... then promptly puking combo burrito.  Meagan
     runs up and looks.  The wall to Stormie's cell is
     splattered with blood and bits.

     Meagan falls to her knees, sobbing as more DEPUTIES
     come running into the cellblock, answering the
     deputy's puke-choked scream.

                    MEAGAN
               (continuing)
          Oh, God... what have I done? What
          have I done?!

     We BOOM OUT of this chaos and go to...


     EXT. LONELY ROAD - NIGHT

     An ambulance races along the road with it's emergency
     lights flashing.  In back Erwin lays strapped to a
     gurney.  Up front sit a DRIVER and an ATTENDANT.  They
     chat disparagingly about the freak in the back, when
     suddenly a large form appears in the road just ahead.
     The driver slams on the brakes and the wheels lock up
     with a terrible SQUEAL.

     WHUMP! -- the ambulance plows into the form, knocking
     it some fifty feet down the road.  The driver and the
     attendant stare out of the cracked windshield in shock.
     Finally, the driver turns to the attendant and says:

                    AMBULANCE DRIVER
          I'll go check it out. You stay here.

     The driver gets out and goes to the form laying in the
     road.  He bends down to examine the charred, mammoth
     carcass when a fist flies up, smacking the driver in
     the face.  He falls to the ground, unconscious.

     The corpse sits up in the glare from the headlights --
     it's Jason!  Burnt and blackened but ready for action!
     He starts towards the ambulance.

     The attendant gets out and pulls his service revolver,
     emptying into Jason's chest.  Jason recoils only
     slightly as BULLET HITS BURST his coveralls, then he
     grabs the attendant by the head as he snaps the empty
     pistol in panic.  Jason slams the attendant's face
     into the side of the ambulance.

     In the back of the ambulance, a terror-stricken Erwin
     watches as a face shaped dent appears in the wall with
     a sickening WRENCHING of METAL and FLESH.  Then...
     silence.

     RIP! -- Jason pulls off the back door of the ambulance
     and climbs inside, the shocks bottoming out under his
     weight.  He reaches out for Erwin, who closes his
     eyes... waiting for the inevitable.

     Then... nothing.

     After a second, Erwin opens an eye.  Jason is standing
     over him, hand outstretched.  In his big, burnt palm
     -- Meagan's necklace.  Erwin looks from the necklace
     to Jason.  Jason thrusts out his hand impatiently.

                    ERWIN
          You... want me to tell you where
          Meagan is?

     Again with the thrusting.

                    ERWIN
               (continuing)
          Well why didn't you say so?! Jesus,
          for a minute there I thought you
          were going to kill me.
               (then)
          You're not, are you?

     Jason shakes his palm at Erwin yet a third time.

                    ERWIN
               (continuing)
          Okay... okay! I'll take you right
          to her. Could you help me out of
          this?

     Jason reaches over and yanks out the gurney straps.

     Erwin exits out the back with Jason following close
     behind.  Erwin climbs in behind the wheel, saying:

                    ERWIN
               (continuing)
          I'll drive.

     Jason pushes Erwin aside so roughly that he slams into
     the passenger side door.

                    ERWIN
               (continuing)
          Okay... you drive.

     As Jason climbs into the driver's seat, a CHIME goes
     off as a female COMPUTER VOICE in a pleasant tone says:

                    COMPUTER VOICE
          Fasten your safety belt, please.

     Erwin fastens his.  Jason watches him and pulls the
     safety belt across his massive chest -- it won't reach.
     Jason pulls harder, ripping the belt out of the bolts.
     The CHIME goes crazy.

                    COMPUTER VOICE
               (continuing)
          Fasten your safety belt, please...
          Fasten your safety belt, please...

     Jason SMASHES the dashboard with his fist, silencing
     the voice and chime.  He turns suddenly to Erwin as if
     to say, "Yeah?! What about it?"  Erwin shrugs nervously:

                    ERWIN
          Fuck the bitch. Let's roll!

     With tires SQUEALING, burning rubber and smoke, the
     ambulance roars away into the early morning.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - DAWN

     Meagan stares through the bars of her cell at the sun
     as it peeks out over the horizon.  The deputy gets up
     to leave for the six a.m. shift change.  As she goes,
     she switches on the cellblock TV.

     ANGLE ON TV -- An early morning religious program
     is on.

                    RELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER
               (filtered)
          This is Channel 12 -- Station W.G.O.D.
          -- where the "W" stands for "Worship"
          And now... "Daily Affirmation" with
          Reverend Lawrence Lovejoy...

     A shot of the REVEREND LOVEJOY at the podium in his
     studio, giving kind words of encouragement.

                    REVEREND LOVEJOY
          Good morning, friends... the Good
          Book says that each morning brings
          a new light into our lives...

     The good reverend goes on about it always being darkest
     before the dawn, have faith and your prayers will be
     answered, etc.  Meagan turns and watches the sunrise
     -- glorious.  Tears stream down her cheeks.  Then a
     commercial comes on:

                    RELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER
               (filtered)
          You can own a videotape of Reverend
          Lovejoy's Daily Affirmation for only
          $19.95...

                           CUT TO:

     EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - MORNING

     In his booth at the main gate, the GATE GUARD watches
     as a procession of hearses approaches.  As the first
     hearse reaches the gate, the guard steps out and says:

                    GATE GUARD
          Hello. What can I do for you?

     A cultist sticks his head out the window and says:

                    CULTIST
          We're here to see the Reverend
          Lovejoy. We need him to perform a
          wedding.

                    GATE GUARD
          Do you have an appointment?

                    CULTIST
          No. I have a Beretta.

     The cultist produces a pistol -- BANG!


     INT. STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

     The REVEREND LOVEJOY is at his podium, his WIFE at the
     organ, waiting for the commercial break to be over.
     The FLOOR MANAGER counts down -- three... two... one...

     BAM! -- the cultists burst into the studio.  The CAMERA
     OPERATOR and FLOOR MANAGER are killed.  The Reverend
     Lovejoy and his WIFE, at the organ, are taken hostage.


     INT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

     ANGLE ON TV as the cultists take the reverend and his
     wife hostage.  Meagan watches, suddenly perplexed.


     INT. STUDIO - NEXT SECOND

     The cultists break into the control room, killing the
     DIRECTOR and STAFF.  One slips into the sound booth,
     garroting the RELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER with a piece of wire.
     Another SMASHES the control board, killing the signal.
     All the feed monitors go snowy.


     INT. CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

     ANGLE ON TV as the picture goes to static.  Just then,
     the deputy appears in front of Meagan's cell.

                    MEAGAN
          Something just happened at the TV
          station.

                    DEPUTY
          Don't worry about it -- get undressed.

                    MEAGAN
          What for?

                    DEPUTY
          Time to get you cleaned up for court.

     Meagan looks back at the TV as she slowly starts to
     get undressed.


     INT. POLICE STATION - SHOWERS - MOMENTS LATER

     The deputy ushers Meagan into the showers.  Inside,
     a naked group of mean, nasty, ugly JAIL HOUSE BITCHES
     are showering, washing hairy pits, flabby tattooed
     skin, and greasy hair.  They eye Meagan like the
     dessert bar at Denny's as she crosses to the opposite
     side, sneaking into a corner.  Meagan turns on the
     shower and drops the towel -- the bitches whistle and
     catcall.

     Just then, the deputy gets called away, leaving Meagan
     to the mercy of the bitches.  The head bitch slides
     over to Meagan and says:

                    HEAD BITCH
          What's the matter, honey... you
          don't like our company?

                    MEAGAN
          I like you... sure. It's just that
          I usually shower alone, that's all.

                    HEAD BITCH
          Oh! So you're shy? I like 'em when
          they're shy...

     The head bitch grabs at Meagan, who resists.  But this
     bitch is big and tough and holds Meagan by the wrists
     as she tries to kiss her.  The other bitches laugh.

                    HEAD BITCH
               (continuing)
          Don't fight it, baby! You know you
          want me...

     Meagan scratches the head bitch's face.  She backs
     off screaming, wiping blood from her face.  Then she
     spits, reaches down (below the frame line) and
     produces a shiv.

                    HEAD BITCH
               (continuing)
          If you won't give me a piece then
          I'll just cut one for myself...

     The head bitch moves in.  Meagan takes a cautious
     step back, bumping into tile -- nowhere to go.  She
     holds up her hands.

                    MEAGAN
          Wait a second... I didn't mean to
          do that... I'm sorry. It's just that
          you come on a little strong, that's
          all. Just give me a little time to
          adjust to my new surroundings...

     The head bitch stops, curious.

                    HEAD BITCH
          Are you saying you want me now?

                    MEAGAN
          Yes... I want you.

                    HEAD BITCH
          Prove it.

     Meagan comes up to the woman, raising her arms.  In a
     flash, the head bitch has the shiv to Meagan's jugular
     -- a warning.  Meagan carefully puts her arm around
     the bitch and kisses her full on the mouth.  After a
     long, uncomfortable moment, they break.  The head
     bitch smiles.

                    HEAD BITCH
               (continuing)
          Now that's more like it!
               (to the others)
          Hey, this bitch is alright!

     The other bitches smile as the head bitch slips her
     arm around Meagan's waist and pulls her tight.

                    HEAD BITCH
               (continuing)
          You're okay, honey... what's your
          name?

                    MEAGAN
          Meagan.

                    HEAD BITCH
          So... what're you in for, Meagan?

                    MEAGAN
               (sniffles a little)
          Oh, my friend...

                    HEAD BITCH
          The bitch that died last night?

                    MEAGAN
               (starts to cry)
          Yeah... they said she had some
          disease that made her... explode!
          Oh, God! Please hold me!

     The head bitch holds Meagan tight as she sobs,
     smoothing her hair.  The other bitches share a look
     of concern as one asks:

                    BITCH #1
          What's this bullshit about some
          killer funk make you explode?

                    HEAD BITCH
               (to Meagan)
          Easy... honey. It's goin' be
          alright. But what I asked you is
          why you're in here?

                    MEAGAN
          Oh... well... the cops? Well, they
          think I gave it to her...

     The head bitch suddenly springs back as if Meagan
     were Satan himself.  She runs for the other bitches
     but they aren't having anything to do with her.  All
     the bitches race for the exit.

     The deputy comes to the shower room doorway and
     shouts:

                    DEPUTY
          What the hell is all the screaming
          about?!

     WHAM! -- the bitches run her over, stripping the keys
     from her belt.  They unlock the cellblock door and go
     running into the police station, screaming butt-naked.
     After the bitches exit, Meagan's hand reaches out and
     drags the unconscious deputy into the shower.


     INT. POLICE STATION - NEXT SECOND

     The bitches come running butt-naked and screaming
     through the station.  Several deputies chase after
     them, tackle them and try to cuff them.  A brawl
     ensues.  Chaos.

     Murdoch sits on a desk, reading a report.  He looks
     up at the madness and mutters:

                    MURDOCH
          Punks...


     INT. POLICE STATION - SHOWERS - MOMENTS LATER

     A DEPUTY enters the showers and sees a naked woman
     on top of a deputy, their arms locked in a struggle.
     The deputy cracks the naked woman in the back of the
     head with her baton and she falls to the side,
     revealing Meagan -- now dressed in the deputy's
     uniform -- laying on the shower floor.

     The deputy realizes her mistake too late -- Meagan
     sprays her in the face with mace and she sinks to
     her knees, screaming and clutching her face.  Meagan
     leaps to her feet, grabs a towel to hold over her
     face (as if she had a broken nose) and starts to exit.

     On her way out, Meagan is passed by several DEPUTIES
     charging into the showers to restore order.  She
     gestures them on, then slips into an emergency exit
     to freedom.


     EXT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Meagan exits the station just as a patrol car pulls
     up.  She reaches in and grabs the JUNIOR TROOPER,
     pulling him out.  Then she slips behind the wheel
     and ROARS off.  The junior trooper calls after her:

                    JUNIOR TROOPER
          Hey, that's Captain Murdoch's car!

                          CUT TO:

     INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

     The cultists surround Reverend Lovejoy as he nervously
     shakes his head, saying:

                    REVEREND LOVEJOY
          I won't do it! It's a sin!
          Blasphemy!

     One of the cultists puts a gun to Mrs. Lovejoy's head.

                    CULTIST
          Wedding or funeral... your choice.

     The reverend swallows and says:

                    REVEREND LOVEJOY
          And who would be the bride?

     Lizzy is brought forth.  The cultists take her arm
     and inject her with the dream dope.  Lizzy's head
     lulls around as she chants softly:

                    LIZZY
          One... two... Freddy's coming for
          you.

     The rest of the cultists shoot up -- passing the
     needle from one to another.

                    LIZZY
               (continuing)
          Three... four... Better lock your
          door.

     The good reverend watches this with a lump in his
     throat.  He shudders and asks:

                    REVEREND LOVEJOY
          And the groom.

                    CULTIST
          He's coming...

     Lizzy is almost asleep.

                    LIZZY
          Five... six... grab your crucifix...

     The neon cross behind the podium begins to flicker.
     Then with a sharp SNAP of electricity, the cross
     falls over, turning upside down.  It hangs there for
     an instant then -- POW! -- the cross EXPLODES, catching
     the curtains on FIRE.

     As the FLAMES consume the curtains, a hole in reality
     appears -- a Dreamgate.  Freddy comes springing out,
     leaping in front of the podium.  He laughs and turns
     to Lizzy, asleep on the bench.

                    FREDDY
          That's for the lift sister!
               (to the cultists)
          Hiya, kids!

                    CULTISTS
               (in unison)
          Hiya, Freddy!

                    FREDDY
          Ready to get hitched?

                    CULTISTS
          Ready, Freddy!

                    FREDDY
          Then let's do it!

     Lizzy looks up and smiles.

                    LIZZY
          I love you, Freddy...

                           CUT TO:

     INT. POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON

     A DEPUTY comes up to Murdoch and says:

                    DEPUTY
          We found your patrol car, Captain.
          It was abandoned near a local
          religious station.

                    MURDOCH
          Religious station? Is there a
          padre there?

                    DEPUTY
          Yes, sir. Reverend Lovejoy broad-
          casts out of that location.

                    MURDOCH
          So that's where they're hiding.

                           CUT TO:

     INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

     Lizzy and Freddy stand before Reverend Lovejoy.

                    REVEREND LOVEJOY
          ...and if there be anyone among you
          who has any reason why these two
          should not be joined in holy...

     Freddy holds up a finger -- "Ah-ah".

                    REVEREND LOVEJOY
               (continuing)
          ...in matrimony. Let them speak
          now...
               (under his breath)
          ...please God...
               (aloud)
          ...or forever hold their peace.

     WHAM! -- Meagan bursts in.

                    MEAGAN
          Stop!

     Everyone turns and looks as Meagan comes to the pulpit.

                    MEAGAN
               (continuing;
                     to Freddy)
          Take me, Freddy. Take me instead.

                    FREDDY
          You're a virgin?!

                    MEAGAN
          Oh, that's right -- tell everybody!

     Freddy moves close to Meagan, running a blade over and
     around Meagan's neck as she struggles to remain calm.

                    FREDDY
          Mmmmmmm! Yes, you are a bit juicier
          than your retard sister... okay,
          you've got the job.
               (to cultists)
          Get her ready.


     EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - NIGHT

     Outside, the cultists surrounding the outside of the
     station watch as dozens of police vehicles swarm to
     the fence.  Murdoch and the S.W.A.T. commander get
     out of the lead car.  Murdoch picks up his bullhorn
     and says:

                    MURDOCH
               (through bullhorn)
          This is Captain Renton Murdoch --
          State Trooper. I'm giving you until
          the count of three to come out with
          your hands up...

     A CULTIST SNIPER FIRES a shot at Murdoch, the bullet
     hit SMASHING the emergency lights atop his car.  The
     other cops duck down, but not Murdoch, he turns
     calmly to the S.W.A.T. commander and says:

                    MURDOCH
               (continuing)
          Hand me that flare pistol.

     The commander gives the flare gun to Murdoch, adding:

                    S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
          Good idea. Throw a little light on
          them -- see if we can spot their
          firing positions...

     As the commander speaks, Murdoch aims the pistol
     carefully and FIRES.  PHOOMPH! -- the flare streaks
     to the roof of the TV station, SMACKING the sniper.
     He BURSTS into FLAMES and tumbles to the ground,
     screaming.  Murdoch hands the flare gun back to the
     commander, going back on the bullhorn and saying:

                    MURDOCH
               (through bullhorn)
          Alright, now I'm through playing
          "nice guy" -- I want the rest of
          you punks to come out right now
          with your hands up.

     The cultists respond by filling the air with hot lead
     -- BULLET HITS RIDDLE the cop cars, SMASHING glass
     and PIERCING metal.  The cops FIRE back, BULLET HITS
     EXPLODING all along the sides of the TV station.


     INT. STUDIO - NEXT MOMENT

     The cultists bare Meagan's arm and inject her with
     dream dope.  She takes her place at the threshold
     beside Freddy.


     EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - SAME TIME

     As the battle outside between the cultists and the
     cops RAGES, Murdoch and the S.W.A.T. commander squat
     down behind a fender to reload.

                    S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
          Well, it doesn't look like they're
          going to surrender.

                    MURDOCH
          What we're going to need then is
          somebody to charge their lines --
          make a hole for us to slip in.

                    S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
          Where are you going to find anyone
          that crazy?

     Just then, an ambulance comes ROARING through the
     police lines, causing the cops to scurry like mice.

                    MURDOCH
          Here comes one now...
               (yells)
          GO GIT 'EM, SON!

     Murdoch squints to see who's driving... it's Jason!
     Erwin smiles and waves to Murdoch through the passenger
     side window as the ambulance zooms past.

     Murdoch curses, drawing his pistol and SHOOTING after
     the ambulance.

     The other COPS join in a moment later, BULLET HITS
     SPARKING off the back of the ambulance as it CRASHES
     through the front gate.

     Inside the ambulance, Erwin hazards a glance back at
     the cops, then he turns to Jason and says:

                    ERWIN
          That was easy enough...

     Erwin looks ahead and screams.

     ANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD as three cultists stand
     directly in front of the speeding ambulance, FIRING
     machine guns.  The glass EXPLODES just as Erwin
     ducks down.

     Two cultists suddenly scatter as Jason rams the
     ambulance into the middle one just before plowing
     into the side of the station with a CRASH.

     Erwin pushes down his airbag just in time to see a
     cultist closing in with a gun.  He reaches through the
     smashed windshield and grabs the squashed cultist's
     machine gun laying on the hood.  Erwin turns, SHOOTS
     the cultist just in time.

     As Jason kicks open the driver's side door he is
     greeted by two cultists SHOOTING at him.  Jason RIPS
     OFF the driver's side door and hurls it at the two
     punks, knocking them down like bowling pins.  Then
     Jason reaches back into the ambulance, pulls out the
     Jaws of Life and, with Erwin covering his back, starts
     towards the front door.


     INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

     The wedding proceeds...

                    REVEREND LOVEJOY
          Once again... if there be anyone
          among you who does not want these
          two people to be joined... let him
          speak now or forever hold his peace.

     Meagan looks around... no one says anything.  The
     reverend clears his throat to continue when...

     WHAM! -- the studio door flies open and Jason appears
     in the doorway holding the Jaws of Life.

                    FREDDY
          Uh, oh...

     The cultists attack Jason.  Jason grabs the first
     one with the Jaws of Life -- folds him in half like
     a rag doll.  Another attacks with a machete... bad
     idea.  One more cultist down and now Jason owns the
     machete.  Jason finishes off the last two cultists
     as Erwin barricades the studio door.  The cultists
     on the other side start POUNDING.

     Jason starts swinging at Freddy with the machete,
     slicing through a camera cable.  CLOSE ON CABLE as
     it falls to the floor.

     Freddy jumps back through the Dreamgate, closing it
     behind him.

     Erwin runs over to Meagan and Lizzy.  He tries to
     wake them but can't.  As Jason lumbers over, Erwin
     looks up and says:

                    ERWIN
          I can't wake them up. Freddy's
          got them trapped!

     Erwin thinks for a moment, then rushes over to a
     couple of dead cultists.  He takes their syringes.
     Erwin jabs Jason in the neck with two syringes full
     of dream dope.

                    ERWIN
               (continuing)
          Go get him, boy!

     Jason staggers forward, falling into...


     INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Jason falls into a boxing arena.  The ropes are
     entrails and atop each corner post is mounted a human
     head.  The spectators are all DEMONS, MONSTERS, and
     the LIVING DEAD.

     Jason looks over at his opponent -- dressed in boxing
     shorts, shoes, and gloves -- it's Freddy.

     Jason raises his arms and finds he too is wearing
     boxing gloves.

     TED BUNDY steps into the ring.

                    TED BUNDY
               (into microphone)
          Ladies and gentlemen... welcome
          to the fight of the century! I'm
          your ring announcer... Ted Bundy!

     BANG! -- a bullet hole appears in Ted's forehead,
     BLOWING his brains out the back.  He falls over DEAD
     and the crowd cheers.  Ted sits up and pulls the wig
     back over his shaved head and electric burns as he
     calls into the balcony:

                    TED BUNDY
               (continuing)
          Verrrrrry funny, Oswald!

     ANGLE IN BALCONY -- OSWALD stands, his rifle still
     smoking.

                    OSWALD
               (angry; defensive)
          It wasn't me!

     Ted Bundy gets to his feet and finishes the intro:

                    TED BUNDY
          In my left corner, weighing in at
          only ninety seven pounds... the
          nightmare master himself! The one!
          The only... Freddddddddy
          Kruuuuuuugerrrrrr!!!

     Freddy holds up his arms and the crowd goes wild.

                    TED BUNDY
               (continuing)
          And on my right... weighing in at
          a whopping four hundred and thir-
          teen pounds... that killer of
          countless teenagers... the big
          guy...
               (gestures to Jason)
          Jason Voorhees!

     CHEERS and BOOS.

                    TED BUNDY
               (continuing)
          And the prize tonight... not one but
          TWO -- count 'em -- TWO virgins...
          ripe for the picking.

     Ted gestures to a large cage suspended over the arena.
     Inside -- Meagan and Lizzy clutch eachother.

                    TED BUNDY
               (continuing)
          Hey, have one now and save the other
          for the ride home. That's what I did.

     LAUGHTER from the crowd.

                    MEAGAN
          Kick his ass, Jason!

     DING! -- the bell sounds.  The first round begins...

     Freddy starts towards Jason, cocking his glove for a
     blow when -- CH-CHING! -- knife blades jut out of the
     glove.  He punches Jason in the stomach and starts
     RIPPING him open, rotten guts spilling out.

     Jason spots a cocktail waitress walking past with an
     axe in her head.  This is BLOODY MARY.  Jason reaches
     over the side of the ring and pulls the axe out of
     her head.  Bloody Mary whips around, yelling:

                    BLOODY MARY
          HEY!

     Jason swings with the axe -- SH-WACK! -- Jason SLICES
     OFF Freddy's arm.  The crowd ROARS.  Freddy looks
     down at the open armpit, GUSHING with ROTTEN BLOOD,
     and shrugs:

                    FREDDY
          Oh, well... I just axed for that!

     Freddy GROWS a new arm, complete with glove of knives.
     Jason throws the axe at Freddy, who ducks it.  The
     axe flies into the audience, SMACKING MUSSOLINI square
     between the eyes.  He falls back to the floor.  HITLER
     turns to EVA BRAUN and says disdainfully:

                    HITLER
          Peasants...

     DING!  The bell sounds.  Freddy and Jason break, going
     into their respective corners.  As Jason sits down in
     his corner, the HUMAN HEAD mounted on his corner post
     starts in:

                    HUMAN HEAD
          That's it, kiddo! You're really
          giving it to him out there! Use the
          left more -- jab! Make him hurt!
          That's the ticket to a knockout!

     Up in her cage, Meagan clutches a terrifed Lizzy.


     INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

     Erwin watches Jason sleep as the cultists BANG down
     the studio door.


     INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - NEXT MOMENT

     DING!  The bell sounds again and round two begins.
     Freddy and Jason get to their feet and close in on
     each other.  Jason swings wide.  Freddy ducks under
     Jason's massive fist just as the referee steps in for
     a close look.  WHUMP -- Jason knocks the ref's head
     OFF, it goes flying up into the balcony.  The crowd
     CHEERS.

     Jason chases Freddy around the ring, looking for an
     opening.  Freddy backpeddles, tripping over the ref's
     decapitated body as several HUNGRY ZOMBIES drag him out
     of the ring, RIPPING his body apart and DEVOURING it.

     Up in their cage, Meagan and Lizzy grimace with
     disgust.

     Jason reaches down and grabs Freddy, hoisting him
     high above his head.  Then Jason body slams Freddy
     to the mat.  The crowd CHEERS.

     Jason starts jumping up and down on Freddy's back.
     Freddy reaches into his shirt and brings out a rusty
     can of spinach.  In a grotesque parody of Popeye he
     opens the can -- full of nasty worms and maggots --
     and gulps it down.  Suddenly, Freddy throws Jason off
     his back and stands, huge muscles ballooning on his
     chest and arms.  At the end of his right hand -- a
     heavy metal boxing glove.

     Jason gets to his feet in time to see Freddy cock the
     massive glove for a blow.

     CHING! -- dozens of spikes spring out of the metal
     glove.  Freddy swings, knocking Jason into the ropes.
     He bounces off and falls to the mat.  The fans go nuts.

     As Jason tries to get up, Freddy swings his right arm
     around and around -- the metal boxing glove turning
     into a giant mallet.  Jason looks up just in time to
     see the mallet coming down.  WHAM! -- Freddy drives
     Jason into the mat.  The crowd goes wild.

     >From up in her cage, Meagan starts to scream:

                    MEAGAN
          Jason! Get up! Get up!

     ANGLE UNDER THE MAT -- it's a dark, foreboding (under-
     water) abyss.  Jason's legs kick, trying to get back
     up.  Something slithers up from out of the deep...
     wisps of empty blackness clutching at Jason's boots.

     Freddy pushes down on Jason's mask, shoving him down.
     Jason struggles but keeps slipping.  This looks like
     the end of Jason.  Freddy laughs.

                    MEAGAN
               (continuing)
          Jason! You've got to get up!

     JASON'S P.O.V. of Freddy looking down at him, pushing
     him down... drowning him...

                                FLASH CUT TO:

     EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - 1953 - DAY

     YOUNG JASON P.O.V. as he is being drowned.  He fights
     to get to the surface... to see... who it is...

     Young Jason breaks the surface for an instant and
     his killer comes into sharp focus.

     It's FREDDY (AGE 13).  His Camp Crystal Lake nametag
     reads:  Hi! My name is Freddy!  He pushes the young
     Jason down again, laughing.

                                HARD CUT TO:

     INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - NEXT INSTANT

     Freddy pushes Jason down into the abyss below the
     mat... laughing, when Jason snaps.  With a burst
     of strength he kicks upward, coming up out of the
     mat.  Jason grabs Freddy by the throat and seizes
     him up with him.

     Jason's momentum carries both of them up to the
     ceiling, where they CRASH through to...


     INT. STUDIO - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Jason "wakes up", holding Freddy by the throat as
     he bangs his head into the lighting gridwork above
     the studio.  A light EXPLODES and Freddy cries in
     pain... then realizes, he's been brought into the
     real world.

                    FREDDY
          Oh, shit!

     Jason throws Freddy to the ground, then raises up a
     boot and stomps Freddy's head, SQUASHING it like a
     tomato.  The Dream Demons squirt out.

     Just then, the cultists BREAK DOWN the studio door.
     They raise their weapons to fire, when their heads
     suddenly IMPLODE.  They fall screaming to the floor
     -- dead.


     EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - NIGHT - SAME INSTANT

     The remaining cultists SHOOTING it out with the
     police suddenly grab their heads, screaming.  Their
     heads IMPLODE and they fall to the ground.  Murdoch
     sees this and says to the S.W.A.T. commander:

                    MURDOCH
          Now's my chance... give me sixty
          seconds to get in there then move
          in.

     Before the commander can reply, Murdoch is off and
     running into the station.


     INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

     Meagan and Lizzy come out of their sleep-like trance
     and embrace.  Then Meagan looks up at Erwin.

                    MEAGAN
          What took you so long?!

     Erwin gestures to Jason, trying to keep his voice low
     so as to not hurt the big guy's feelings.

                    ERWIN
          What ever you do... don't let this
          guy drive.

     Meagan smiles at Jason.

                    MEAGAN
          I knew you would come...

     Jason and Meagan look over to where Freddy's body is
     fast decaying... turning back into blackened bones,
     scraps of cloth, and a rusting glove of knives.

     The Dream Demons squirm around on the studio floor,
     then swim into the open end of the camera cable and
     disappear.

     In the control room, Freddy's face appears on every
     monitor, laughing.

                    ERWIN
          Oh, no! Freddy's in the transmitter!

     Erwin watches as an electrical Freddy-impulse races
     from the control room via a long thick cable running
     overhead.

                    ERWIN
               (continuing)
          He's going for the satellite dish!
          If he uplinks with a communications
          satellite he can beam himself any-
          where in the world! We'll never be
          rid of him!

     Meagan and Jason look up at the Freddy-impulse shoots
     past them, going through the ceiling to the...


     EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - ROOF - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     The satellite dish mounted on the roof.  It begins
     to pulsate with an olive and red glow -- getting
     ready to beam Freddy.


     INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

     Meagan reaches up and grabs the cable, pulling it
     hard.


     EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     The roof gives way, tilting the big dish just as it
     BLASTS the laughing Freddy-beam into the night sky.


     EXT. EARTH'S UPPER ATMOSPHERE - NEXT INSTANT

     The Freddy-beam just misses the satellite, ricocheting
     off one of the solar panels and sending the satellite
     tumbling into deep space.

     The deflected Freddy-beam now zooms towards the sun.

     Inside the beam -- Freddy sees the sun zooming up
     and screams.  His face burns away, leaving a screaming
     skull.  That too burns away, leaving the Dream Demons.
     One by one they burn up as the beam reaches the sun.

     ANGLE ON THE SUN as the beam EXPLODES, causing a
     solar prominence.


     INT. TV STATION - STUDIO - SAME TIME

     The ceiling collapses in on Jason, burying him under
     a ton of rubble and the big antenna dish.  A ton of
     dust billows up.

     Just then, Murdoch bursts in.  He sees Lizzy and
     Meagan and takes aim with the shotgun.  Erwin sees
     this and jumps in-between them, yelling:

                    ERWIN
          No! Wait!

     Murdoch FIRES.  The shotgun blast knocks Erwin across
     the room, where he lands in a heap.  Meagan and Lizzy
     run to his side.

     Erwin struggles to breathe -- a large hole in his
     chest.  With fading strength, Erwin pulls his pin
     out and pricks himself.  Erwin smiles and dies.

                    MEAGAN
          Erwin? Erwin?!

                    MURDOCH
          He's dead... and so are you if you
          don't put your hands up right now!

     Lizzy turns and attacks Murdoch.  He knocks her to
     the floor, taking aim on her head with the shotgun
     as he says:

                    MURDOCH
               (continuing)
          It's time I taught you girls some
          respect for the law!

     In a panic, Meagan snatches up a pistol from a fallen
     cultist and FIRES it at Murdoch's head.

     PTT-TWANG! -- Murdoch's hat goes flying off with a
     SPARK HIT, revealing his bald, hideous head -- a
     large open wound with a metal plate underneath.  He
     turns towards Meagan with an evil grin on his face.

                    MURDOCH
               (continuing)
          So... you wanna be a punk?

     Murdoch raises the shotgun, taking aim on Meagan.

                    MURDOCH
               (continuing)
          Then die like a punk!

     Murdoch starts to squeeze the trigger when Jason's
     hand shoots out of the rubble pile behind him.  Jason
     jams his hand down the back of Murdoch's pants and
     pulls up his briefs, lifting him a foot off the floor
     with a Jason-wedgy as he rises from the rubble.  We
     see Murdoch's name written into his shorts.

     As Murdoch screams, Jason jerks the shotgun from his
     hand and jams it up his ass -- right through the seat
     of his pants.  Murdoch's cheeks bulge out as the
     muzzle slams into the roof of his mouth.  Jason cocks
     the shotgun and...

     BOOM! -- Murdoch's head and shoulders EXPLODE from
     his torso, leaving his broken spine sticking up out
     of shirt.  Bits of Murdoch splatter the floor as his
     metal plate comes PINGING down, rolling around and
     spinning to a stop like a hubcap.

     Jason drops Murdoch (what's left of him) to the
     floor just as the S.W.A.T. commander and his men
     come charging in.  They see Jason and raise their
     guns in panic.

                    MEAGAN
          NO!

     Too late.  The cops let loose with a BARRAGE of GUN-
     FIRE.  BULLET HITS EXPLODE on Jason's chest.  Meagan
     grabs Lizzy and covers her up as the bullets WHIZZ
     past.

     More cops hear the SHOOTING and come running.  They
     start SHOOTING too.  Soon the doorway to the studio
     is crowded with muzzle flash.

     More and more BULLET HITS SMACK Jason.  A bullet
     hole outline appears on the wall behind him.

     The cops start running out of ammo and a cry goes
     up, "More ammo! More ammo!".

     VARIOUS INSERTS OF cops going for hideout pistols,
     opening their trunks and taking out ammo cans,
     passing the weapons and ammo up the staircase to the
     cops in the studio.

     Jason keeps getting SHOT.  Pieces of his are flying
     off.  Fingers shot off of a hand.  A knee shot away
     to reveal the bone.  Dozens of BULLET HITS going off
     of his chest and head.

     Finally, the cops start to run out of ammo.  The
     SHOOTING subsides and finally grinds to a stop, leaving
     the cops knee-high in brass and a thick layer of
     gunsmoke in the room.

     As it clears, Jason still stands.  He teeters a little,
     then falls backwards with a mighty THUD.

     Jason lays dying.  Meagan rushes to his side.  Jason
     reaches into one of the giant holes in his chest and
     pulls something out -- Jesse's heart.

     Jason hands the heart to Meagan.  Then Jason's head
     rolls back -- he's dead.

     Meagan begins weeping as we pull up out of the studio,
     revealing her surrounded by Jason, Freddy, and Murdoch.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Meagan tucks Lizzy into her bed.  She gives her the
     Raggedy Ann doll and kisses her goodnight.  As Meagan
     turns out the light, Lizzy asks:

                    LIZZY
          You forgot to check under the bed.

     Meagan clucks and bends down, peering under the bed
     -- nada.

                    MEAGAN
          No monsters here.

                    LIZZY
          But what if they come back?

                    MEAGAN
          Then we'll just have to kick their
          ass again.

     Lizzy giggles.

                    LIZZY
          I love you, Meagan.

                    MEAGAN
          I love you too. Go to sleep.


     INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     As Meagan crosses to her room, her parents call up
     to her from the bottom of the staircase.

                    MEAGAN'S DAD
          Meagan?

     Meagan looks down at her parents.

                    MEAGAN
          Yes, dad?

                    MEAGAN'S DAD
          Your mom and I... well, we want to
          thank you for saving your sister's
          life... we know you went through
          a lot.

                    MEAGAN'S MOM
          We're going to be there for you
          from now on... for both of you!
          And that nice lawyer we hired for
          you said he thinks he can get all
          the charges dropped... except maybe
          for the grave robbing and human
          desecration ones.

                    MEAGAN'S DAD
          Everything is going to be fine.

                    MEAGAN
          I know...

                    MEAGAN'S MOM
          And I'm going to get sober...

                    MEAGAN'S DAD
          We're going to be a normal, happy
          family again.

                    MEAGAN
          I know...

                    MEAGAN'S MOM
          Goodnight, sweetheart.

                    MEAGAN
          Goodnight mom... goodnight dad.

                    MEAGAN'S DAD
          Goodnight, Meagan.


     INT. MEAGAN'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Meagan is ready for bed, drawing back the covers,
     when the phone RINGS.  She picks it up.

                    MEAGAN
          Hello?

                    FREDDY
               (filtered)
          I'll be seeing you in your dreams...

     Freddy's nasty tongue slithers out of the handset and
     licks Meagan in the face.  She yelps and slams the
     phone down.

                    MEAGAN
               (sighs)
          I know...

     Meagan puts the phone in a drawer and closes it.  She
     climbs into bed and pulls back the pillow to reveal
     the pistol Erwin gave Jesse to kill Freddy.  She smiles
     and puts the pistol back under the pillow.

                          BLACKNESS:

     The phone RINGS.

     ROLL END CREDITS:

     Then... at the very end...

                          CUT TO:

     INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - SAME TIME

     Ted Bundy and all the spectators are looking up at
     the hole in the ceiling that Jason and Freddy made
     when they went back to reality... waiting.

     Finally, somebody says:

                    MONSTER
          I don't think they're coming back.

                    TED BUNDY
          Okay, folks... show's over. Every-
          body can go home now.

     All the monsters get grumbling and start to exit.

                          CUT TO:

     BLACK... now it's over.

                    THE END
