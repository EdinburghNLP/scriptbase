                         DEEP SPACE

          A darkness like no other, a silence that is unsettling.
          Sharp pinholes of light show a sea of distant stars across
          the void of outer space. Our own motion is only realized as
          an enormous object slowly moves towards us, taking shape.
          A SPACE SHIP of unimaginable size, a tubular freighter easily
          ten times larger then any aircraft carrier. At first glance
          it appears lifeless and adrift, but slowly the small glow of
          cockpit windows come into view as we move closer.
          Moonlight cuts across the hull, displaying the name; EDEN.

          BOWER (V.0.)
          Where were you... when Eden was lost?
          Like every other kid on my block, I was
          in the middle of a dream, envious of
          those who were chosen to be part of
          mankind's greatest quest. Dreaming of
          the unknown and trying to imagine what
          only the lucky few would encounter.
           We PUSH IN towards the cockpit windows and...

                          DISSOLVE THRU:

          INT. COCKPIT (EDEN) - CONT.

          Inside the flight deck it's ghostly vacant, rows of empty
          flight chairs and numerous guidance computers gently
          blinking. With half filled coffee-cups and jackets hung over
          the seat backs... it appears the control deck has been
          suddenly evacuated.
          Muffled SCREAMS are heard somewhere deeper inside the ship.

          BOWER.(V.0.)
          As the entire world watched in wonder,
          there were only a few, skeptical of the
          journey's success.

                         (BEAT)
          Only a few... who would be right.
          The further we move into the ship... signs of violence
          appear, smears of dark blood sharply standing out on the
          bright white paneling and several broken computer screens.
          The muffled SCREAMS grow louder and clearer... an argument
          between men, panicked rage over-lapping.

                         CONTINUED:
          CAMERA slowly moves past a corner to see the middle-of a
          violent confrontation. One OFFICER is locked inside a sleep
          chamber, banging on the glass and pleading with panic.
          Another OFFICER is on the floor, mortally wounded, his body
          still twitching with his head bashed in. The INSANE OFFICER,
          a young corporal is moving from terminal to terminal, typing
          in commands with a casual and emotionless nature.
          Blood streams have run down his face from both ears and nose
          as he continues to type commands into the flight computer...
          heightening the trapped OFFICER'S muffled,. screams.

                         TRAPPED OFFICER

                         (IN FRENCH)

          STOP IT! STOP FOR GOD'S SAKES! PLEASE!

          GOD NO!
          The INSANE OFFICER hits the final command key and warning
          buzzers ignite with flashing lights. He closes his eyes,
          taking a breath of relief.

                         TRAPPED OFFCIER

                         (IN FRENCH)

          STOP IT! YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS WILL

          DO TO- YOU'RE NOT- STOP! YOU'RE GOING

          TO FUCKING KILL US ALL!
          The trapped OFFICER begins pounding on the glass with a
          crazed panic as the INSANE OFFICER calmly goes to his own
          sleep-pod and climbs inside, sealing the hatch.

          TRAPPED OFFCIER (CONT-D)

                         (IN FRENCH)

          PLEASE GOD! NO! NO GOD DAMMIT!
          Control panels flash and hydraulics ignite. Like a row of
          tumbling dominos, each of the sleep-chamber pods shift
          positions with a SHUSH of hydraulics and then... they are
          launched with a ROAR of micro-jets.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. SHIP "EDEN" - CONT.

          We're suddenly back into the unsettling silence as... like a
          bee hive that's exploded, thousands of coffin-sized sleep
          pods are ejected from the ship in unison. They are sent
          tumbling into open space in every direction as the ship
          slowly continues its unaffected course.

                         CONTINUED:
          The trapped OFFICER is seen SCREAMING in silence inside his
          own pod.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. OUTER SPACE

          We slowly float towards an astroid field. As we grow closer
          it's the sea of sleep pods slowly floating through space.

          BOWER (P.O.)
          Where was I... when I heard we'd lost
          Eden? Just like every other kid on my
          block... I was dreaming... of being one
          who would be chosen to follow.
          As we move closer to the asteroid field of sleep pods, it's
          obvious that time has passed, a single skeleton inside each
          of the pods, hands in a clawing position towards the glass.
          We PUSH IN towards one pod, moving towards the SKULL, still
          locked in a SCREAMING position, wide mouthed and...

                         CUT TO:

          M. HYPER-SLEEP CHAMBER
          A RUMBLE passes... EYELIDS TWITCH... A GASP.
          Inside a coffin-size chamber, a dim glow of light seeps
          through a small glass porthole. A MAN is asleep, a mask
          attached to his face, tubes of liquid feeding into his arms.
          CORPORAL BOWER, military physique, chiseled features. His
          chest lightly expanding, blood pulsating through his veins.
          Lights FLICKER PAST and his body comes to life, muscles
          flinching, breath quickening. He squirms with discomfort,
          ripping away the mask. He gasps, trying to SCREAM.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT - CONT.

          His scream is muffled under three inches of glass. The hatch
          door is hit with a THUD and white gases erupt from the edges.
          THUD, THUD... THUD! The door bursts open and BOWER scampers
          out, struggling to rip away the feeding tubes. He HITS the
          floor, naked and gasping. His pores ignite, dripping sweat.
          He tries to get to his feet, but his legs wobble underneath
          him, collapsing. He yells at the floor.

                         CONTINUED:

                         BOWER
          Burns are red! Bruises... blue-
          His voice echoes into the dark, alone in a cavernous room as
          he pauses, struggling for orientation. He gets to his feet,
          muscles twitching. His short-cropped hair is... pure white.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          Hey...? HEY!!? Someone?
          A constant low RUMBLE is present, joined by the occasional
          MOAN and CREAK of a large ship. A SHUDDER travels through
          the room with a random FLICKER of LIGHTS to reveal...
          A massive steel compartment, tangled with technology. It's
          cold and institutional. High-tech computer terminals slope
          out of the floor. The FLICKER passes, taking us into black.
          We hear him: fumbling through the room, switches are thrown
          with no result and compartments are pulled opened and...
          SNAP! A glow stick comes to life.
          He squints at his darkened surroundings with confusion. A
          drip of liquid catches his eye and he staggers back to his
          sleep pod. He grabs the dangling tubes that were ripped from
          his arm and he sucks on the tube, pulling as much liquid into
          his mouth as possible.
          After a few heavy gulps, he suddenly heaves towards the
          floor. He painfully forces himself to drink, gasping.
          He looks up to notice two sleep chambers next to his own. He
          leans closer with the glow stick to see the first one, the
          name plate reading; 2nd Lt. Cooper. It's EMPTY.
          The third pod's name plate reads; LT. PAYTON. Deep inside
          there is the figure of a man, asleep under a mask.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          Payton? Lieutenant... Payton?
          He turns back to his own pod, seeing the name plate that
          reads; CORPORAL BOWER. Even this name doesn't seem familiar.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          Bower? Bower...?
          The loss of memory heightens his fear even more as a shiver
          travels through his body while he staggers towards a nearby
          computer terminal. He taps the keys on a computer terminal.
          Nothing. He frowns, leaning closer.

          As he taps the keyboard, powder blooms out from under his
          fingers. He wipes the surface of the panel to see a thick
          layer of dust. Under the smear is...
          Elysium - Flight Systems - Operation Terminal #87153-D.
          He pulls focus to see... his FINGERS are trembling
          uncontrollably, an odd vibration of nerves. He slowly makes
          a fist with concern.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. STORAGE LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          BOWER walks along a row of storage lockers reading each name
          plate. He stops at the locker labelled; Corp. Bower. He
          pauses, mumbling the name once again with no recognition.

                         BOWER
          Bower.
          He opens the locker to see an assortment of personalized
          belongings, uniform and gear, none of it seeming familiar.
          He uses a towel to wipe off the layer of sweat and oily
          substance coating his body, pausing to see an identification
          tattoo on his forearm that reads: FLT>>005Â»015.
          He pulls on a black flight suit, emblems and military
          markings of rank on the chest. He pulls on shoes and a tool
          belt with a high powered pen-lamp.
          On the inside of the locker is a emergency manual card with
          block figures displaying breathing and stretching exercises,
          labelled; Hyper-Sleep Disorientation Recovery Procedures.

          He freezes on... A PHOTO tucked inside the door. EVALON, a
          beautiful young woman smiling towards camera. He stares at
          the-photo, his frown deepening with confusion. He checks the
          back for a name, but nothing. He tucks the photo into a
          pocket and exits.

          DISSOLVE THRU BLACK:

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT - LATER

          BOWER waves his hand over a sensor... no power. He steps in
          front of a heavy set of steel doors, flipping several
          switches and... nothing.

                         CUT TO:
          BOWER breaks open a storage bin, pulling out beverage packets
          and a cup, taking a seat at the control desk. With Evalon's
          photograph leaned against the console, he becomes lost in a
          gaze as he gulps down nutrient pills and stirs an instant
          coffee as we...

                         PUSH IN
          There is a conflict in his eyes, memories trying to return.

                         FLASH CUT
          An image FLASHES past, EVALON smiling as BOWER kneels next to
          her, gripping her hands.
          BOWER'S gaze remains hollow, frown deepening as he sips the
          cup and... winces with disgust.

                         BOWER
          Faa-uck!
          Distant THUMPS. He pans the pen-lamp across the ceiling and
          toward the sounds... PAYTON'S sleep chamber.
          THUMP, THUMP, THUMP: Muffled and desperate. CRACK! Bower
          jumps back as someone kicks their way out from inside, the
          hatch bursting open. Out climbs...
          PAYTON, a man in his forties, but the rugged physique of a
          man half his age, lean and agile. His military-style hair
          cut is also pure white. Gasping for breath, he hits the
          floor as BOWER tries to help him. PAYTON jerks with shock.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          Whoa! Hey... easy! Lt. Payton? You're-
          Sir... whoa!
          PAYTON chokes and gasps, then glances up, giving Bower a once
          over with a frown and a sobering tone.

                         PAYTON
          Who are you?

                         BOWER
          Sir... I don't know where anyone is.
          PAYTON takes breaths, trying to regain his senses, glancing
          around at their darkened surroundings.

                         PAYTON
          Hit the lights, will ya?

                         BOWER
          Ah... we're having some power problems-

                         PAYTON
          Who woke you up?

                         BOWER
          Umm, not sure. It had to have been the
          flight computer. There's no one here...

          .except us.

                         PAYTON
          Cold in here.
          BOWER grabs him a towel and water container, turning back to
          see PAYTON doesn't waste any time, stretching his limbs.

                         BOWER
          There's no power coming off the main
          grid. Can't fire any of the...

          Dynos. Can't even open the doors.
          PAYTON glances to the other empty sleep-chamber with a frown.

          (off his look)
          Our 2nd Lieutenant? I don't know where

          None of the systems are on-line.
          Mainframe is down, so I don't know how or

          Until I have two coffees you're just
          gonna have to repeat all this shit, so
          let's just idle here for a bit.

                         BOWER
          Sorry. I just- Just glad to see you
          awake. i was... a little concerned. I
          didn't know what to do if-
          PAYTON gets to his feet, stumbling. BOWER catches him under
          the arm as they stagger into the wall.

          BOWER (CONT`D)
          Easy... Lieutenant. Easy.

                         PAYTON
          Coffee?

                         BOWER
          I'm on it.

                         PAYTON
          Good man.
          BOWER helps him to the locker room as LIGHTS FLICKER past.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. STORAGE LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          PAYTON staggers along the row of storage lockers as BOWER
          helps guide him with the flashlight beam. PAYTON pauses with
          a frown as he glances across the name-plates, none of them
          seeming familiar. BOWER gestures toward the locker, the name-
          plate reads: LT. PAYTON.

                         BOWER
          This is you, sir.

                         PAYTON
          How do you know that?

                         BOWER
          1 It's... the name on your sleep pod, sir.
          PAYTON opens the door to see his belongings inside, a photo
          of WIFE (MARIANNE) inside the door. He stares at it with
          utter confusion. BOWER takes this in, looking to the memory
          recovery card inside the locker.

          it says that the memory loss is only
          suppose to be a momentary loss that's-

                         PAYTON
          Very reassuring. I guess when you gamma
          the brain into extended REM, sometimes it
          can take a while to get it back.
          PAYTON pulls on his flight uniform and squeezes his feet into
          his shoes. BOWER notices the identification tattoo on his
          forearm, partially obscured from view;
          FLT>>00... (obscured by grime, hair and angle). Unlike his
          own, PAYTON'S tattoo is faded with age.

                         BOWER
          I've been awake for at least an hour and
          I still can't remember my... anything.

                         PAYTON
          Listen, the last time I crawled out of a
          hyper bunk, it took me... quite a while
          to get it all back.
          BOWER holds his frown as PAYTON squeezes his finger into a
          wedding ring.

                         BOWER
          What was... your last flight, sir?

                         PAYTON

                         (BEAT)
          Don't recall. The Kuiper Belt odyssey?
          Don't worry, it'll come back, eventually.
          PAYTON kisses the photo of his wife.

                         PAYTON (CONT'D)
          I've gone through this before. I just
          can't remember why I would agree to do it
          again.
          PAYTON goes to close his locker and BOWER motions with a
          serious tone.

                         BOWER
          Sir? I know this is going to sound
          strange, but do you even know where we're
          going? I can remember the training,
          but... not the mission. Know the
          procedures, not the... destination.

                         BOWER
          Didn't even know the ship's name until I
          saw it-on the console. For all I know
          this was another damn training exercise-

                         PAYTON
          Trust me, it's not. if this is a
          simulation...
          PAYTON notices both of their reflections off the mirrored
          panel inside the locker... revealing their WHITE HAIR.

                         PAYTON (CONT'D)
          Someone is taking the joke a little far.
          He shuts the locker and they exit, the flashlight's beam
          panning away, taking us into darkness.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT/CONTROL DESK - LATER

          BOWER and PAYTON are standing at the control console, the
          screens flickering with distortion. BOWER hands him a coffee
          and PAYTON takes a sip... with a wince of disgust.

                         BOWER
          None of the activators are working.

                         PAYTON
          Figures. We can ride two hundred
          thousand tons of space freighter across
          the galaxy without a dent in the hood,
          but can't get one good cup of coffee.
          PAYTON flips a few switches with no result of power.

                         BOWER
          Without the mainframe, we can't connect.
          I don't know how we'll ever be able to-
          PAYTON is in his element at the control desk, flipping open
          an emergency auxiliary-power panel. He snaps open a handle
          and he forcefully gives it several rotations with a MOAN of
          whirling magnetos. The hand-crank allows a dim glow of
          electricity to the light panels.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          Oh, I- didn't even think of that.

          PAYTON gives him a look with a grin and flips a switch.

          Five? How do you know that?
          BOWER pulls up his sleeve, exposing his tattoo ID. PAYTON
          nods, "good thinking."

                         PAYTON (CONT-D)
          Lt. Payton of Flight Team Five. Does
          anyone copy? Anyone... respond? Anyone
          awake up there?
          Dead static.

                         BOWER
          Team Four suppose to be here for the
          shift rotation. Where could they be?

                         PAYTON
          Fucking teamsters. Maybe they couldn't
          get to us.
          BOWER eyes the third empty sleep-chamber.

                         BOWER
          Where could he have gone?
          PAYTON gazes off blankly. A RUMBLE of FLICKERING LIGHTS pass
          and the computer screens slowly fade, going black.

                         PAYTON
          The power systems must be free-floating
          off blown circuits or something. The
          over-ride grid won't even lock in.

                         BOWER
          Whatta ya think?

                         PAYTON
          I think we need to find a deck of cards
          and call the union.
          Distant THUMPS are heard overhead and they freeze... watching
          the ceiling with uncertainty.

          Hmm. Ventilation... maybe. Systems keep
          re-booting after each surge. That could
          be anything.
          THUMPS fade as the ship eerily MOANS and CREAKS.

                         PAYTON (CONT'D)
          I say we get out of here. I'd rather be
          up and out then stuck in the trunk.
          The room is blocked by the two heavy steel doors on either
          end, security doors ten feet wide. PAYTON leads the way
          towards one end, gesturing towards the doors.

                         PAYTON (CONT'D)
          We're not far from the bridge but without
          the circuits locked in... I don't know
          how we could ever get this thing open.
          As they approach, their flashlight beams pan across the door
          to see jagged chips and scratches all along the edges. Tools
          are scattered on the floor, the control panel ripped open.

                         BOWER
          Jesus. Somebody was trying to get out.

                         PAYTON
          Ironic. I think it was built to protect
          us.

                         BOWER
          (gesturing to the third pod)
          Well, he got out... some how.
          A RUMBLE approaches... another SHUDDER that FLICKERS the
          lights. They watch the ceiling as BOWER counts in his head
          as it fades.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          Cycle is broken.

          What?

                         BOWER
          It's not circuitry. Reactor timing is
          off-set in the core. Seems sporadic, but
          it's not. Each revolution decreasing
          before starting over from the beginning.

                         PAYTON
          How the hell do you know that?

                         BOWER
          I dunno. I can't remember my own- but I
          know everything there is to know about
          that damn reactor.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          That's twelve revolutions, before
          recycling. And this one will only last-
          As they watch the ceiling, their flashlight beams stop on a
          small ventilation shaft that's been ripped open. They
          exchange a look and...

          INT. VENTILATION SHAFT - MOMENTS LATER

          Their lights spill inside an endless steel shaft only a foot
          and a half in diameter, leading into darkness.

                         PAYTON
          Now if we only had a monkey and a rope.
          PAYTON climbs down as BOWER rotates his jaw with eagerness.

          Our 2nd Lieutenant must have gone this

          Must have.

          It's the only way out.

          BOWER squeezes inside, pushing himself forward several feet
          as PAYTON peeks inside behind him. With one last look, BOWER
          holds the pen-lamp in his teeth and begins to crawl, pushing
          himself forward on his stomach, only several inches at a time
          in a rhythmic motion.
          Grunt, slide, breath. Grunt, slide, breath.
          PAYTON'S flashlight slowly fades from sight.

          BOWER'S pen-lamp slowly emerges and he pauses to catch his
          breath. With anxiety shown across his sweat coated face, he
          squints down the endless shaft.

          BOWER quickly pushes himself forward reaching an intersection

          The light pans to endless shafts in each direction. He SNAPS
          a glow stick to life, letting it drop down the vertical
          shaft... silently into nothing.

                         BOWER
          A whole lot of the same... nothing.

          PAYTON (ON RADIO)
          If you're gonna take a turn let's keep
          track. That way you can get back if
          there's no way out.

                         BOWER
          Don't say that.
          BOWER lowers his head, breathing heavily.

          PAYTON (ON RADIO)
          If you haven't seen anything yet... maybe
          you should head back now.
          BOWER sets his jaw and suddenly spots a SPIDER, gently
          dropping down from a string of web. It lands and quickly
          scurries away.

          surveillance cameras on the ship, images too quick and
          distorted to recognize but resembling empty corridors and
          vast cargo compartments.

          PAYTON looks to the name plate that reads Elysium and a small
          emblem above it, a global shape with a spiral design.

          As he stares at the emblem, it seems memories are returning,
          a frown hardening on his face.
          Distant THUMPS snap him from his trance and he pans his
          flashlight towards the wall.

          THUMP... SCRAPE... THUMP.
          He nervously pans his light slowly up the wall and across the
          ceiling. A shiver of uneasiness goes through him as he sits,
          trapped within the room alone. He tries to divert his fears,
          turning to the control screen, giving the hand-crank a whirl.

          eyes nearing desperation. Pipes are cutting through the
          shaft on both sides, making his crawl space even smaller and

          unknown liquid dripping from the tables. Garbage litters the
          floor, a dim glow of light emerging from the galley.
          He crawls along the edge of the counter and peeks inside the
          galley, horribly ran-sacked. In the midst of the wreckage, a
          darkened FIGURE is seen scavenging through the cupboards,
          angrily tossing empty containers aside.
          The FIGURE pauses, sensing a presence and glances back as...
          BOWER ducks. He contemplates, pulling out the envelope
          opener and slowly peeks back out and...
          POW! He's HIT in the face, blood spraying, slamming onto his
          back. The pen-lamp and envelope opener spin across the
          floor. BOWER tries to get up and he's grabbed by the hair, a
          blade pressed against his neck.

          nails painted with bright pink polish.

          BOWER is confused, realizing her eyes are looking past him.
          A BLUISH GLOW seeps in from the doorway, approaching from the
          corridor. He looks back to see NADIA is running for the
          kitchen... gone.

          He ducks below the tables as a FIGURE slowly enters the room,
          carrying a long steel spear-like device with a splinter of
          blinding BLUE FIRE on the tip, fueled with a chemical sprayer
          like a welder's torch.
          His obstructed view reveals the FIGURE as a tribal warrior,
          scantily clad, elongated muscular frames, pale skin coated in
          hydraulic fluid. Bald head with clumps of tangled hair. It
          moves smoothly and silently, jabbing the tip of the flaming
          device into each corner and crevasse, as if flushing out
          anything hidden.

          The FIGURE quickly spins his direction and SNAPS a lever on
          the spear-device, killing the blue flame and taking us
          instantly into darkness.
          BOWER holds his breath with fright, back pedalling on his
          knees as his eyes try to adjust to the dark. He takes an
          uneasy breath to realize... there is more then one.
          Slowly moving out of the shadows, four more HUNTERS slowly
          emerge, like a unified pack on the prowl. They carry an
          assortment of crudely made weapons, spears and blades of
          sharpened metal.
          The apparent leader of the pack is HEFLIN, the largest and
          strongest of the group and he directs the pack with an
          assortment of odd vocal sounds, deep HISSES from the throat
          and gargled CACKLES.
          On command, the one HUNTER flips a lever and the BLUE FLAME
          crackles back to life with a burst of flammable liquid. The
          hunt continues, the pack weaving through the debris,
          following NADIA'S path.
          As the BLUISH GLOW fades, BOWER is left bewildered and
          terrified. Suddenly, his radio sounds...

          The only clear view is off an overturned bowl that shows
          WEASEL'S face, oddly contorted in the rounded reflection.
          WEASEL is headed directly for BOWER until.., a HISS from
          HEFLIN calls him back. WEASEL takes one last look before
          turning back, the torch fades from view, taking us into

          We've got to try to contact the bridge.

          PAYTON (ON RADIO)
          You're assuming there is someone on the
          bridge.

          You're not!? We're not the only ones

          PAYTON goes to the doors, coated with desperate scrapes and
          dents.

                         PAYTON
          If they're in there... why haven't they
          thrown the security hammer into lock
          down? Seal and freeze it until the
          emergency units wake?

                         BOWER
          Maybe they can't. With the systems
          kicking on and off- Maybe they're flying
          blind, with no control of the LFS?
          PAYTON eyes the scattered tools across the floor and the
          ripped open ventilation shaft.

                         PAYTON
          Either way we can't assume help will be
          coming. On-board or off. Out here,
          there is no rescue. There is no turning
          around. This thing wasn't even built...

          Our job is to obtain control of this

          antique astrological and navigation devices. He spots an
          antique pistol. He breaks the glass, grabbing the gun, but
          it crumbles under his grip, falling to pieces.
          He sighs, but pauses to see... because the furniture is
          angled, his light spots a hiding spot underneath the desk.
          He pulls out a silver flask, bone dry. He reaches further,
          pulling out an unusually shaped weapon, much like a sawed-off
          shotgun with rounded edges. He snaps open the hand-crank
          I lever and gives a forceful whirl. A slow MOAN of magnetos
          causes the weapon's lights to dimly come to life.

          I'm just thinking, maybe there's
          something we haven't considered. Eden

          five thousand people killed with the flip

          because of Eden.
          BOWER pauses... within reach of the window only to realize it
          was an illusion. A glass compartment door left slightly ajar
          was reflecting a circular light panel, smeared with oil to
          give the illusion of craters. His shoulders drop in defeat.

          BOWER heads down the corridor, making a turn as...

                         ANGLE ON
          A shadowed FIGURE steps into view, slowly following his path
          into darkness.

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK

          PAYTON is lost in thought as he watches the computer screens
          slowly fade with power. He grabs the hand-crank lever, but
          pauses to hear the sounds are returning, muffled and distant.

          THUMP, SCRAPE... RATTLE.
          He turns his light towards the ceiling and wall, which almost
          seems to silence the sounds. The crackle of the radio snaps
          him from his thoughts...

          INT. CORRIDOR

          BOWER is crouched in the corridor, panning his light down the
          corridor with shifting eyes of confusion.

                         BOWER
          Have I done a circle or am I doubling
          back?

          PAYTON (ON RADIO)
          Why do you say that?

                         BOWER
          I've seen this before. This-
          We follow his flashlight to reveal... a BODY tangled in a
          wire snare. It appears to be the same dead body he witnessed
          before, but as he steps closer, it's different. This body
          has ripped clothing and isn't gutted.
          It's... SHEPARD, a thin-framed man in a torn crew uniform,
          tangled in a wire snare wrapped tightly under his arm and
          around his neck.

          SHEPARD'S eyes POP open wide with a terrified expression,
          completely silent until BOWER sees him. BOWER jumps with
          fright and SHEPARD wildly squirms, SCREAMING bloody-murder.

                         SHEPARD

          AAAAEEEE IH !
          His SCREAMS echo down the corridor, desperately fighting
          back, like an animal caught in a trap.

                         BOWER
          Stop it! Jesus, I'm not gonna- SHUT-UP!

                         SHEPARD

          NO! PLEASE!! AAAERRGH!
          BOWER hits him in the gut, knocking the air from his lungs.
          SHEPARD crumbles, wheezing for air, going silent.

                         BOWER

          thing. But, you have to be quiet,
          understand?
          SHEPARD'S gaze is hollow and disturbed, deeply traumatized.
          BOWER pulls on the wire that's rigged to the hydraulics of a
          nearby doorway, SHEPARD moans.

          Bower, you sure that's a good idea? He

                         COULD BE-
          SNAP! The wire snare snaps free and SHEPARD goes to the
          floor gasping. BOWER kneels over him to help, but SHEPARD
          erupts with a shriek, like a hyper-sensitive rape victim.

          BOWER hesitates, the flashlight reveals SHEPARD'S
          identification tattoo through the ripped uniform and blood-
          soaked bandages. It reads; FLT//006//017

          SHEPA.RD begins to moan, mumbling and weeping as he rubs
          circulation back into his limbs with nervous laughter.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          Hey? You with me? You're gonna be
          alright. Hear me?
          Squinting past the glare of the flashlight, SHEPARD notices
          BOWER'S clean uniform and the radio boom on his chin. He
          begins to weep, tears of joy and agony.

                         SHEPARD
          Shepard, Thomas L. Team Six. Sector

                         SHEPARD
          So... you don't have a fucking clue to
          what's happened? Is that it?

          You'll fit right in.
          i SHEPARD feels along the pipes until he finds one leaking oil.
          He vigorously begins to rub the oil onto his body.

          What ! ?
          SHEPARD rubs oil across his neck and then goes to check the
          corner, wrapping a strap around his fist to secure a
          screwdriver into his hand.

                         SHEPARD
          I can't help you. I'm sorry.

          i freezes as distant THUDS are heard down the corridor. They
          both look to see... the GLOW of BLUE TORCFE'S growing.
          SHEPARD begins to tremble, backing away. BOWER sets his jaw,
          stepping out into the corridor and slowly cranks the power-
          lever... with a WHINE of magnetos, raising the weapon.

          INT. FILTRATION COMPARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

          BOWER has a difficult time trying to keep up as SHEPARD
          weaves through a compartment filled with filtration units and
          a maze of piping.
          BOWER spots a clear path but BUMPS into glass. He realizes
          the compartment is separated by thick glass dividers. He
          changes directions and sees SHEPARD crawling through a vent.
          He tries to follow as... a BLUE TORCH moves past the doorway,
          bare feet running across steel. A collection of HISS and
          CACKLES grow louder.
          BOWER crawls under piping to hide. He notices the activation
          lights on his weapon fading... and he quietly tries to give
          the energy lever a few turns... but the WHINE seems too loud.
          He spots SHEPARD twenty feet away, hidden behind a console.
          I They exchange a look and SHEPARD angrily waves him away.

          Don't follow me! I can't help you-
          SHANK! A wire noose SNAPS tight around SHEPARD'S neck. Much
          like a pole and wire rig used to wrangle alligators, the wire
          is released from the rig and SHEPARD bursts into a wild
          frenzy, trying to run while on a thirty foot long leash. The
          wire loops and tangles around the piping as...
          HUNTERS move in from every direction, blades whirling.
          SHEPARD'S SCREAM intensifies as the HUNTERS huddle over him.
          BOWER viciously cranks the energy lever on the weapon and
          climbs out of his hiding place as... SCREAMS intensify
          within the brutal attack as the HUNTERS begin to feed.
          SEEPARD'S neck is twisted far enough to SNAP!

          only fifteen feet away. He pulls the trigger and rusted
          metal SCREECHES! Jammed.

          He panics, grabbing the gun with both hands, checking for a
          safety switch and... KA-WHAP! The weapon discharges a
          tremendous BLAST of energy off to the side.
          -The weapon is designed to destroy biological and organic
          material, but for safety precautions, it's unable to
          penetrate man-made materials like lead, glass or steel. It's
          unable to puncture the ship's hull.
          The energy blast is an electrical discharge that CRACKS like
          lightening and echoes like thunder. The blast HITS the side
          of the wall with a deafening RIPPLE of aftershocks,
          shattering anything fragile and knocking over anything not
          fastened down within a thirty foot radius. This little thing
          packs a punch.
          The HUNTERS turn towards BOWER, the lead hunter turning to
          reveal itself as...
          } HEFLIN, a muscular-frame larger then the rest, skin
          glistening with a layer of hydraulic fluid along with tribal
          I scars and distorted war paint. His eyes hidden under shadow.
          He slowly lifts his shoulders while lowering his head, much
          like the fluid motions of a reptilian predator.
          BOWER frantically cranks the energy lever and raises it
          toward HEFLIN, completely unaffected by the threat. He
          squeezes the trigger and...
          KA-WHAP! The gunshot is THUNDEROUS, HITTING the unseen glass
          divider between them. The safety glass absorbs the blast,
          sending a SHUDDER through the hull.
          HEFLIN barely flinches, stepping closer with a HISS. Off his
          command, the HUNTERS take chase, swarming in every direction,
          searching for a route around the glass divider.
          BOWER runs for his life.

          BOWER gasps heavily, hyper-ventilating as he catches glimpses
          of HUNTERS on his trail and running parallel in adjacent

          off the edge of a loading shaft, into an open elevator shaft
          that drops into darkness.
          The wire tightens and he's swung by the foot back into an
          open corridor, two floors below, like a demented base-jumper.
          He SLAMS into the ceiling and spins wildly over the open
          shaft as his transmitter falls all the way to the bottom
          exploding on IMPACT.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK

          The radio STATIC instantly changes to a HISS. PAYTON looks
          to the meters... signal gone.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. CORRIDOR

          BOWER grabs the wall to stop from spinning and frantically
          pulls on the wire around his leg as it rips through his skin.

                         BOWER
          Aaaargh!
          Footsteps are heard approaching overhead. On the floor below
          him are his weapon and flashlight. He stretches for the
          gun... too far from his reach.
          The flashlight is "on", illuminating the area. He pushes off
          the wall and reaches for it... fingers touching, but unable
          to grab it.
          The GLOW of torches grows in the loading shaft and BOWER
          pushes off, reaching for the flashlight. Unable to retrieve
          it, instead he pushes it... into the open loading shaft. It
          drops all the way to the bottom as...

                         ANGLE ON
          HUNTERS step up to the edge of the shaft, looking down to see
          the flashlight fall from sight...

                         ANGLE ON
          BOWER swings back, grabs the wall and freezes.

                         ANGLE ON
          The HUNTERS hear the flashlight HIT the bottom of the shaft
          and then slowly double back. Torches fading.

          ANGLE ON/CLOSE UP
          BOWER'S face fills with blood as he hangs upside down, trying
          to catch his breath. His grip is weakening as he looks up to
          see... a shadowed FIGURE crouched with a spear in hand,
          leering at him from the shadows, approaching. With no time
          to defend himself and no where to go...

          SCREECH!
          The cable is violently tugged from above, jerking BOWER
          upward, pulling him away from the wall. He spins wildly
          trying to grab back onto the wall as...

          SCREECH!
          The cable yanks BOWER upwards with enough force to hit the
          ceiling and swing toward the open shaft. His fingers claw at
          the wall as he's literally being reeled in like a fish. He
          sees the FIGURE charging with a bladed spear. He's knows
          he's done for and...

          SNAP! The wire is slashed, BOWER breaks free hitting the
          floor as the cable is jerked up and out of sight.

                         ANGLE ON
          The silhouettes of the HUNTERS on the ledge, several levels
          above, inspect the loose cable and after a HISS, they turn
          back, fading into the shadows.
          BOWER lays on his back, squirming in the tangled wire as the
          FIGURE hovers over him, spinning a bladed weapon in his hand.

          BOWER (CONT' D )
          Please... don't- Please, listen-
          The FIGURE slashes BOWER'S sleeve, rips away the fabric and
          looks at his identification tattoo.
          BOWER quits squirming as the FIGURE leans closer into the
          light with a curious frown.
          TANAKA, a Japanese man in ripped and modified clothing.
          Unlike the awkward gauntness of the HUNTERS, he has a full-
          framed, hard-edged physique and soft brown eyes.

          TANAKA jabs a finger into the emblems on BOWER'S uniform.

          They share a nod and an awkward silence, BOWER still eyeing
          the razor sharp weapon in his hand and not wanting to move.

          TANAKA is dead pan. BOWER flinches as TANAKA picks up the
          energy gun and then... flips it over, handing it back to him.
          BOWER cautiously accepts as he climbs to his feet.

          Realizing louder doesn't mean clearer, BOWER sighs at his own
          idiocy. TANAKA nods, but with obviously no clue what was
          1 just said. They stare at one another in silence.
          TANAKA hands him a flashlight. BOWER does his best charades,
          gesturing to himself and pointing to the ship.

          Right. It doesn't really matter- You
          should stay put. Or go back to your
          compartment sector- Wait for the
          security systems to engage. Okay? We're
          gonna take care of this problem.
          Dead pan.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          Okay?
          BOWER slowly backs away and TANAKA follows. BOWER stops,
          I eyeing his numerous bladed weapons.

          Stay!
          TANAKA frowns as BOWER backs away, gesturing. BOWER reaches
          the next intersection and looks back. TANAKA is gone. He
          continues down the corridor as LIGHTS FLICKER past.

          BANG! BANG! BANG!
          PAYTON is coated with sweat, viciously pounding on the locked
          doors with a heavy pipe. It's obviously having no effect and
          he collapses with exhaustion and frustration.

          !

                         PAYTON

          GOD DAMMIT!
          He.lowers his head and slowly... the "SOUNDS" return.

          Like a dripping faucet of annoyance, PAYTON bitterly turns
          his flashlight quickly towards the corner. Wielding the
          heavy pipe, he cautiously approaches.

          SCRAPE... RATTLE.

                         PAYTON (CONT'D)

          WHO'S THERE!?

          IDENTIFY YOURSELF!
          His flashlight pans up the wall to the ventilation shaft.

                         PAYTON (CONT'D)
          Dower...? That can't be... you-
          The SOUNDS remain muffled, deeper within the wall, possibly
          from inside the ventilation shaft.
          PAYTON contemplates, eyes panicked. He climbs up the wall
          and wedges the panel cover over the shaft opening, jamming it
          closed with a screwdriver. He backs away, gripping the
          weapon, ready for anything. He tries to control his
          breathing as he sits... watches... and waits.

          TRAP.
          A blood droplet hits the floor by his feet and PAYTON wipes
          blood off his nose with confusion and a nervous frown.

          DISSOLVE THRU BLACK.

          INT. REC ROOM - LATER

          A pin-point of light appears at the end of a circular tunnel.
          Slowly the light grows as BOWER approaches and cautiously
          steps through a doorway and into...
          A rec room with several rows of pool tables, video games and
          a ran-sacked bar. The floor is heavily littered with broken
          glass and BOWER wipes his finger across a wet surface on the
          bar, tasting it with an eye brow raised.

          He climbs over the bar, checks numerous cabinets only to find
          more broken glass and emptied containers. About to give up,
          he pops open the last cabinet and...

          POW! A FIGURE lunges out, a direct HIT under his jaw sends
          him backwards over a table. The FIGURE jumps on top of him,
          jabbing a blade toward his neck. He grabs the wrist just as
          the tip begins to dig into his throat.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)

          AAAAARRRRGF! !
          A quick struggle ensues and just as BOWER is about to be
          sliced open... CRACK! The ATTACKER is HIT and sent flying.
          TANAKA has come to his rescue, twirling a pipe across his
          palms. The ATTACKER rolls to her feet to reveal... NADIA.
          She snatches a pool ball off the table and throws it directly
          into TANAKA'S chest.

                         TANAKA

          UUUGH!
          She rolls across the floor, grabbing her knife and... BOWER
          BLINDS her with his flashlight, raising the gun with a quick
          whirl of the energy lever, laser sights flaring brightly.

                         BOWER

          HOLD IT!
          BOWER ducks as a broken bottle WHIZZES past his face,
          smashing against the wall. He raises the gun and...
          KA-RAAAACK! A deliberate warning shot goes past NADIA and
          HITS the bar, SHATTERING every piece of glass that's near by
          and NADIA and TANAKA are both blown off their feet.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          Knock it off! Both of ya!
          TANAKA and NADIA slowly recover, both quickly try to find
          their weapons on the floor.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          Listen... nobody needs to get hurt here.
          Both of you just... cool out. And stop
          throwing that shit.
          Her eyes dart with uneasiness as she finds her knife.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          Let's all just... go easy here. I
          understand it's been every man for
          himself around here lately, but if we're
          going to get out of this- A little God
          damn solidarity wouldn't hurt.

          NADIA remains poised, ready to fight, knife raised. Sighing
          with defeat, BOWER gestures, hands raised as he motions for

          They both go to work, attempting to wedge the door open with
          pipes. BOWER looks back to see... NADIA. They back pedal
          with weapons in hand and NADIA is unaffected, watching them

          I'm heading for the reactor bay.

                         NADIA
          You just wake up?

                         BOWER
          Just joining the program already in
          progress, yeah.
          She eyes him over and TANAKA keeps the pipe raised.

                         NADIA
          You'll never make it.

                         BOWER
          Oh yeah? And why is that?

                         NADIA
          You're going the wrong direction.
          She grimaces and turns, heading back up the corridor. BOWER
          and TANAKA exchange a look. BOWER chases after her.

                         BOWER
          Hey? Wait a second- HEY?

                         NADIR
          SSSSH! Keep it down-

                         BOWER

                         BOWER
          Wait- Can't join the team without a
          name.

                         NADIA
          Team? Why would I want to join?

                         BOWER
          Because I need you to show me the way.

                         NADIA
          To the reactor? No thanks. Don't like
          going that fax down. No one ever comes
          back.
          She continues up the corridor and BOWER grabs her arm. She
          yanks away from his touch, squaring off, weapon in hand.

                         BOWER
          Hold on. Please- There's not much time
          left before we lose everything onboard.
          You understand what I'm trying to-

                         I NADIA
          Do you know where this ship is headed?

                         BOWER
          I'm working on it.

                         NADIA
          Can you fly it?

                         BOWER
          Huh?

                         NADIA
          Can you fly it... if you have to?

                         BOWER

                         (NOT SURE)
          Sure.
          NADIA eyes him over, sizing him up.

                         NADIR
          I'll get you as close to it as I can.
          But, I won't wait for you.

                         I
          BOWER nods with a frown and she heads up the corridor. BOWER
          and TANAXA watch on.

          LIGHTS FLICKER past as...
          NADIA leads them down a long corridor that widens into an
          atrium of shafts going into the darkness in every direction.
          The further their lights pan across the shafts... a strange
          assortment of odd colored algae and moss is revealed growing
          up the walls of the shafts.
          TANAKA keeps a watchful eye as BOWER frowns at the
          surroundings.

                         BOLTER
          You know where you're going? This
          doesn't... "feel" right.

                         (NO RESPONSE)
          How long have you been awake?

                         NADIA
          Don't know. There's no way to tell time
          in here. Two... maybe three months.

                         BOWER

          MONTHS!?
          His voice echoes across the cavernous atrium and she glares-

                         NADIA
          Quiet! You wanna get us killed!?

          NADIA stops at the foot of a large steel door, gesturing for
          them to crouch in the shadows, watching the corridor.

                         BOWER
          Where are we going? What are we doing-

                         NADIA
          i Shush! We're waiting.

                         BOWER
          Waiting for what-?

                         NADIA
          Quiet!
          At the far end of the corridor, a faint BLUISH GLOW grows
          stronger. Shadows are moving, growing closer.

                         BOWER

                         SHIT-
          NADIA gestures for them to stay put. TANAKA wants to leave,
          but BOWER grabs his shoulder. They both grip weapons,
          glancing to NADIA as the HUNTERS seem to be headed their way.

                         BOWER (CONT-D)

          The HISS and CACKLES of the HUNTERS grow closer and it seems
          they're shortly going to be cornered and done for until...
          A SHUDDER is felt, a FLICKER of LIGHTS approaching. She goes
          to a control panel, holds down a switch and presses her palm
          F across a scanner.
          As the power SURGE passes, the control panel activates,
          scanning her hand and the steel door activates with a MOAN of
          hydraulics. BOWER notices her ID tattoo; BIO-T>>218>>076.

          open only a half foot. She squeezes through and BOWER and
          TANAKA quickly follow. They help her push it shut, sealing
          the lock with a CLANK.

          INT. BIO-LAB VAULT - CONT.

          NADIA secures the lock on the door and jams a pipe in the
          handles, her own added insurance.

                         BOWER
          Who are they? What the hell are those
          things?

                         NADIA
          (shaking her head)
          Never quite felt like sticking around to
          find out. Running... is always the best
          option. Believe me.

                         BOWER
          They're not- They can't be from this
          ship. They don't seem... human. Do you
          think something got on board or maybe
          I something...
          He turns to follow her and pauses to see...
          The BIO-VAULT. A large lab storage compartment that has been
          "lived-in" for a long time. A bed has been created from
          assorted chair cushions and there is a collection of
          scavenged items. NADIA adds to the items, dumping the
          belongings of her bag onto the floor.
          BOWER is in awe as he approaches an entire wall of glass test
          tubes, a maze of micro-biological containers, glimmering with
          condensation.

                         BOWER (CONT-D)

          The rows of glass tubes are labelled, ranging from mountain
          goats to octopi, everything a new world would need.

          NADIA checks a few gauges on the wall of tubes and makes
          adjustments on the monitoring system. He senses her
          meticulous care for the material.

                         BOWER
          You've been living in here? You're...
          protecting it?

                         NADIR
          It' seems to be the only living thing left
          on this ship worth protecting.
          Regardless of the situation, we still
          have a mission. We've only lost about
          thirty percent of the specimens, mostly
          reptilian class. Never was big into
          snakes anyway.
          BOWER doesn't share the attempt at humor, wandering towards a
          darkened digital screen on the wall, displaying a charted
          graph of the new planet, TANIS.

                         BOWER
          (under his breath)
          Tanis.

                         NADIA
          (off his look)
          You couldn't remember?

                         BOWER
          No, I- I didn't remember just how far
          away it is... until now. This was a
          hundred and twenty-three year flight.
          NADIA begins to gather a few items shoving them into a bag.
          TANAKKA leans closer to the glass display with fascination,
          tapping the tubes to see movement inside.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          How could I have forgotten that?

                         NADIA
          It comes only in pieces. Even after a
          few months. I know everything about this
          vault and its systems... but I still
          can't remember where I grew up. Or my
          brother's name. Only pieces... And the
          training comes back first. For good
          reason, I guess.
          BOWER eyes the darkened computer terminals, portions of the
          consoles coated in algae.

          NADIA ponders the thought, rotating her jaw. She digs into
          her supplies and tosses him a small block of orange material.

          Dehydrated meatloaf. House special. I
          save 'em for the weekends.
          BOWER sniffs it with a sneer and tries to break off a
          piece... hard as a rock.

                         NADIA (CONT'D)
          Do you know how long it would take to
          turn dehydrated meatloaf into that?

          How long?

                         NADIA
          I don't know, but it takes more then a
          couple years to turn coal into fucking
          diamonds.

                         BOWER
          You think we've over slept?

                         NADIA
          This ship was built to outlast our
          children's children... and any engineer
          could tell ya the warranty is running
          out. I think we've been asleep longer
          then you may think.
          BOWER tosses the orange brick. to TANAKA and he sniffs it with
          a grin, breaking off a piece. NADIA finishes gathering tools
          and she slings the bag over her shoulder, "ready to go".

          PAYTON is asleep, seated on the floor, back to the wall. He
          is awoken by...

          RATTLE... THUMP, THUMP!
          He instantly grips the pipe and turns on the flashlight. The
          "SOUNDS" are closer then ever before as something is heard
          crawling towards the panel in the ventilation shaft.

          ANGLE ON/CLOSE UP
          A vent panel lightly RATTLES, the metal begins to bend.

          The screwdriver SNAPS and the panel hits the floor. PAYTON
          raises the pipe, preparing to fight and... A desperate gasp
          is heard from inside the shaft.

          GALLO (O.S.)
          Help... me!
          PAYTON pauses, angling the light inside to see... GALLO, a
          young flight officer, boyish innocence, short-cropped hair,
          heavily coated in sweat, desperation in his eyes. His hair
          is dark brown, the only person without pure white hair.

                         PAYTON
          Who the hell... are you!?
          GALLO is tightly wedged inside the shaft, squirming to crawl
          out, trembling with fear and exhaustion.

                         GALLO
          Help me- I'm part- of the flight crew!
          I'm- Please- HELP ME!
          PAYTON oddly hesitates... before lowering the weapon. He
          digs into the shaft grabbing GALLO'S hand, pulling him out.
          GALLO collapses onto the floor, crumbling into a fetal
          position, naked. His hands are locked in claw-like grips,
          trembling uncontrollably. His gasps are rapid and unsteady.

          PAYTON runs to grab a towel and water. As he turns back he
          notices GALLO'S hip and legs are sprayed with dried blood.
          PAYTON kneels over him and GALLO spasms from his touch.

                         GALLO

          Com'on. Try to drink a little. Here.
          GALLO is unresponsive, wide eyes locked in a trance.

          What's that? Gallo...?
          PAYTON frowns, mumbling the name with a hint of recognition.

          The... bridge.
          Saying the words seems to send him into a terrified trance.

                         PAYTON
          The bridge!? Where are we? What's
          happened? Can you tell me-

          GALLO is hyper-ventilating, eyes wide with terror. A droplet
          of blood slowly builds in his nostril, refusing to drip. A
          low whine is heard in his throat as... LIGHTS FLICKER past.

          A hatch is broken open and BOWER'S flashlight beam peers into
          a ventilation shaft. Twenty feet inside the shaft the walls
          are collapsed, blocking passage. NADIA sighs with dread.

                         NADIA
          We can't get through this way.

                         BOWER
          I'd prefer to stay on foot.

                         NADIA
          It's the safest way to travel. And
          there's only one other way to get through
          that I know of.

          She leads the way along the wall and into a compartment of
          unimaginable size, fifty foot high steel walls that channel
          through the room. The walls are lined with hundreds of sleep
          chambers, stacked ten high on either side.
          They round a corner into the main atrium to see dishevelled
          equipment and smashed control consoles, scarred from battle.
          Old blood stains are worn deeply into the floor.

          As they venture deeper inside they see numerous sleep-
          chambers, open hatches and empty. The further they move
          along the wall, more and more empty pods, too many to count.

          As the dozens and dozens of nameplates move past his

          No, wait. My wife could be in here.
          BOWER'S focus completely shifts, turning towards the pods,
          reading name plates.

                         NADIA
          What does she do? What's her specialty?

                         BOWER

          They look to see TANAKA has fallen behind, crouched and
          peering off towards the dark. He's poised like a dog on the
          prowl that's caught a bad scent. They crouch and crawl to
          the adjacent corner.

                         BOWER
          I don't see what he's looking at, do you?

                         NADIA
          We have to keep moving. We don't want to

          Hey...? Let's go!
          Distant THUMPS are heard somewhere in the room and they
          tighten up with their weapons, eyes scanning. TANAKA refuses
          to look away, poised like a hunter.

          We can't stay herel
          NADIA heads across the main floor and BOWER tries to wave him
          on, but TANAKA is locked onto something, refusing to waver.

                         BOWER
          Let's get out of here! Com'on-
          The THUMPS grow louder and TANAKA heads into the shadows.

          of dishevelled equipment, leaving TANAKA behind.

          BOWER emerges from the barricades into a processing center
          for loading passengers, darkened and in shambles. NADIA is
          scanning the corridors ahead, choosing her path as BOWER
          rushes to catch her.

          We can't just leave him. We have to wait-

          and narrowing tunnel. BOWER hesitates with frustration.
          Having to choose, he turns and chases after NADIA.
          I They crawl through a maze of machinery and NADIA'S pace is
          difficult for BOWER to keep up.

          Wait! I'm coming-
          There's a CRUNCH under his foot. He lowers his light,

          Behind BOWER is a massive stack of human skeletons and
          carcasses. They've just crawled into a pit of human remains.
          They both back away with horror only to see a mountain of
          carcasses on both sides. The only route is upward and they
          begin to crawl up the slope on their bellies, over dead
          remains.

          NADIA suddenly grabs him, a quick jerk to silence him. A
          SHADOW passes with a CACKLING HISS. They freeze, laying on
          top of the remains, the bones CRINKLING underneath them.
          The HISS grows stronger... and they look up to see a
          silhouetted HUNTER crouched over like a gargoyle on a rafter,
          leering in their direction.

                         (WHISPER)
          Don't move.
          They try to remain motionless, but the slope of the remains
          i CRINKLES underneath them and the hill of remains begins to
          slide. The HISS grows stronger.
          They hold their position until... a SHUDDER approaches with
          FLICKERING LIGHTS. The power surge is enough to ignite a
          small landslide underneath them.

                         SHIT-
          NADIA grabs his arm as bones snap and they slide helplessly
          to the bottom within a landslide of bones and flesh.
          The finally slide to a stop at the bottom of the slope and
          BOWER quickly raises his weapon towards the rafters to see...
          the HUNTER is gone.

          from five feet away. BOWER is STRUCK with enough force to
          send him flying, CRASHING into a pile of bones.
          NADIA spins around with a bladed pipe in her hands... but the
          HUNTER is already gone. She spins back and... THWAP! She's
          HIT from behind and sent with break-neck force into the
          floor. The HUNTER pounces onto her back and a claw-like hand
          grabs her hair... teeth opening towards her neck and...
          POW! BOWER charges into the HUNTER, tackling it and they
          spin into a brutal and distorted fight, seen under the
          FLICKERING LIGHT. Even though the HUNTER is a smaller one,of
          the pack, smaller then BOWER, its speed and strength is in-
          human. It grabs BOWER by the head with a GROWL and...

          with his bladed pipe into the HUNTER'S face. It's a hit that
          would normally kill anything, nearly taking its head off.
          The HUNTER stumbles, staggers and... HIIIISSSSSST! It HITS
          TANAKA, sending him airborne, nearly knocking him out.
          Under the FLICKERING LIGHT, BOWER, NADIA and TANAKA all
          attack the lone HUNTER, taking all three of them to bring it
          to the floor. They viciously pound it with pipes and blades
          until it finally stops flinching beneath them.
          Its pale white skin seeps a thick black colored blood. The
          three of them back away, gasping and coated in its blood.

          The HUNTER flinches and our gang back pedals with fright.

          to see... HEFLIN silhouetted, leering towards them.

          clank through the hull.

          NADIA is already gone. BOWER and TANAKA chase after her as
          the walls come to life, HUNTERS swarming onto their path like
          a pack of wild dogs.
          Before diving through the barricade, BOWER looks back to see
          HEFLIN and his pack have paused... to eat the fallen HUNTER.

          sleep chambers. HUNTERS can be heard closing on their trail.
          They round a corner and NADIA jumps inside an empty sleep-
          chamber, frantically trying to pull the hatch closed. TANAKA
          follows suite, jumping inside another chamber and BOWER
          scrambles, in search of an open door as footsteps are heard
          quickly approaching.
          In a frenzied panic, BOWER dives into the chamber with NADIA,
          tugging the hatch closed.

          BOWER and NADIA are cheek to cheek in the cramped space, both
          gasping for breath and dripping sweat with terror.
          Through the porthole... silhouetted HUNTERS move past with
          weapons in hand, search and destroy style. One HUNTER steps
          up only a few feet from their porthole and they freeze,
          holding their breath. Slowly the HUNTERS continue past, the
          shadows slowly fading from sight.

                         BOWER

          They listen for a long moment... hearing nothing as BOWER

                         NADIA
          You want to go back?

                         BOWER
          No, I mean... let's just go!

                         NADIA
          We should go back. Find a different
          path. I don't think we can get through
          to the reactor bay from-

                         BOWER
          You said there was no other path.

                         NADIA
          I'm ready to explore other options-

                         BOWER
          Which way did they go-?

                         NADIA
          You really want to discuss it here!?
          A RUMBLE is heard approaching and they all crouch in unison.
          It's a power surge that sends FLICKERING LIGHTS across the
          massive corridor and a BLINKING LIGHT is activated on a
          nearby sleep-chamber. And then...
          BANG! The hatch door is KICKED from the inside, white gas
          erupting from the seam. Our gang quickly crawls toward the
          shadows, crouching behind equipment to watch as...
          Another KICK bursts open the hatch and a BIG PASSENGER crawls
          out, slamming onto the floor with a shiver of agony, gasping
          for breath, muscles twitching.

                         BIG PASSENGER

          AA.AAAA.RGH !

          73.

                         CONTINUED:
          The BIG PASSENGER tries to get to his feet, gasping and
          heaving, mumbling in Russian. BOWER tries to stand but NADIA
          pulls him back.

                         NADIA
          What are you doing-!?

                         BOWER
          They'll hear him- They'll- We've got to

                         HELP HIM-
          Footsteps thunder across the floor and... WHACK! The BIG
          PASSENGER is STRUCK by a single blow from HEFLIN. The
          HUNTERS have returned in full force and they come out of the
          shadows from every direction, bladed weapons spinning.
          BOWER pulls away from NADIA'S grip and prepares to intervene,
          but TANAKA suddenly grabs him, holding him back with force.
          With the BIG PASSENGER wounded and moaning on the floor, the
          HUNTERS gather in a circle in ceremonial fashion, praying
          thanks for the feast the ship has presented.
          They watch helplessly as the BIG PASSENGER is then brutally
          attacked and eaten alive. WEASEL leads other HUNTERS under
          the flickering light in a demented and twisted celebratory
          dance, a frenzy of pure evil.
          This attack is heard more then it is seen, under flickering
          lights, obscured view and most of the camera angles on Bower
          and the groups reactions.
          Frozen in horror, BOWER is tugged by TANAKA, following NADIA
          to the corner where she's lifted a grate in the floor. They
          climb into a shaft under the floor and into the dark as...
          The SCREAMS and HISSES echo through the hull.

          FADE THRU BLACK:

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK - LATER

          PAYTON is seated at the control desk, scrolling across radio
          frequencies, talking softly into the boom mic.

          PAYTON (INTO RADIO)
          Bower? Do you copy? You out there?
          Dead static. He sighs and glances toward GALLO, passed out
          on a nearby bunk. He hesitates, holding the pipe as a
          weapon, tucking it away and cautiously approached GALLO for a
          closer inspection.

                         CONTINUED:
          He feels his neck for a pulse. He notices the dried blood
          under his nose then gently pulls aside the blanket to see
          GALLO'S identification tattoo, reading; FLT>>004>>012.

                         PAYTON (CONT'D)
          (frowning to himself)
          Team Four. Flight Team... Four?
          He glances up to see GALLO is now awake, staring at him.

                         GALLO
          What are you doing?

                         PAYTON
          Just... checking you.
          GALLO narrows his eyes, pulling the blanket tighter.

                         GALLO
          For what?

                         PAYTON
          To make sure you're... alright. You...
          passed out. You-

                         GALLO
          Who the hell are you?

                         PAYTON
          Payton... Lieutenant Payton.

                         GALLO
          Lieutenant? You're... a lieutenant?

                         PAYTON
          That's right. You're Team Four? You're
          suppose to be... my predecessor.
          GALLO deepens his frown, glancing around with disorientation.

                         PAYTON (CONT'D)
          You said... you came from the bridge?
          GALLO shifts his eyes back on him, a bad topic.

                         GALLO

                         (LEERY)
          Yeah. So...?

                         PAYTON
          Where are we? I can't get guidance off
          this system and I have no idea where-

                         GALLO
          I don't know.

                         PAYTON
          Well, what did you see? How did--

                         GALLO
          Listen, I'm not a navigator. Stars all
          look alike. I don't know! How the hell
          would I know!?
          Sensing GALLO is about to break down again, PAYTON tries a
          calmer approach.

                         PAYTON
          Easy. I just want to make sure...
          GALLO'S hands are trembling, uncontrollably.

                         PAYTON (CONT'D)
          .you're okay-
          GALLO tucks his shaking hands under the blanket, defensively.

                         GALLO
          I'm fine.
          PAYTON lowers his stare, hesitating, glancing across the
          dried blood still splattered across his legs.

                         PAYTON
          Is this your blood... Corporal?

                         GALLO
          Some of it is... sir.

                         PAYTON
          Whose blood is it?
          GALLOholds his stare, jaw muscles tightening.

                         GALLO
          They didn't give me any choice.

                         PAYTON
          Who didn't?

                         GALLO
          There was something wrong with them.

                         PAYTON
          i Something was wrong with who?

          Off his stare, he understands the implication.

          PAYTON (CONT' D )
          Your crew?

                         GALLO
          It was... Pandorum.
          (off his look)
          Of the worst sort. They were- I
          couldn't even- I had to defend myself.

                         PAYTON
          Pandorum. Both of them-?

                         GALLO
          You don't believe me?

                         PAYTON

                         (UNCONVINCED)
          I believe you.
          PAYTON goes to a nearby compartment, popping open a First-Aid
          case; inside is a pistol-gripped syringe. He turns back and
          GALLO squares off, clenched fists.

                         GALLO
          What are you doing? What is that?

                         PAYTON
          It's just a sedative. Help you relax-
          GALLO lifts his fists with a threatening posture.

                         GALLO
          Then you take it... and relax.
          PAYTON backs off, setting the syringe aside.

                         PAYTON
          Take it easy. We're on the same team
          here. Alright?

                         GALLO

                         (FLATLY)
          Sure, Lieutenant.
          PAYTON turns back to the control console and continues his
          search across the radio frequencies. He discreetly pulls the
          pipe weapon closer to his seat.
          GALLO holds a hollow stare on the back of his head.

          LIGHTS FLICKER past...

          FLICKER CUT TO:

          INT. SUB-LEVEL SHAFT - LATER

          A FLICKER of LIGHT passes to reveal... BOWER crouched inside
          a three-foot high, narrow passageway, a crawl space beneath a
          steel grated floor. He follows the tunnel into a large silo
          lined with octagonal filters.
          TANAKA and NADIA are both looking for a way out, jabbing
          pipes into the grate overhead, unable to budge it.

                         BOWER
          Didn't we come through here already?

                         NADIA
          We gotta find a way out.

                         BOWER
          Out? Why did we come iii-?

                         NADIA
          I was trying to get us out of there alive-

                         BOWER
          I thought you knew where you were going.

                         NADIA
          I was trying to save our asses-

                         BOWER
          Could've mentioned that after the first
          mile. If I would have known we'd be
          doing laps down here-
          She angrily turns towards him, pipe in her hand.

                         NADIA
          I didn't need to help you at all! You
          and the Hong-Kong Express would still be
          playing ding-dong-ditch on level eight if
          it weren't for me!
          Their heightening confrontation is halted by...

                         TANAKA
          HIIISSST! ( .and whispered Japanese)

          They pause to hear... CLASSICAL MUSIC echoing from below.

                         BOWER
          What the hell is that?
          They climb down the shaft, jumping from filter to filter. At
          one level they follow the sound into a shaft opening and
          towards the soft, warm GLOW of YELLOW LIGHT.
          They reach an open hatch, peering inside to see...
          Inside an empty storage tank, a comfortable living space has
          been created; numerous chairs surround a make-shift dinner
          table made from storage crates with hand-made candles and
          various food containers. The tank appears empty.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          What is this!?
          BOWER and TANAKA begin to climb through and NADIA hesitates
          with uncertainty. They crawl through the hatch...

                         FOLLOW THRU:

          INT. TANK - CONT.

          They climb into the empty tank, lined with valves and
          filtration screens. The music is playing from crackling
          speakers hidden in the darkened circular catwalk overhead.
          TANAKA goes straight for the food and as soon as NADIA steps
          through the hatch... a wire SNAPS! Levers clank and a mouse-
          trap has triggered... SLAMMING the hatch closed. Trapped!
          They instantly turn back to the door, yanking and tugging in
          a panic. BOWER pans his light towards the catwalk only to
          see a FIGURE (LELAND) scampering through the shadows.
          Another lever is turned and... F00000SH! A stream of vapor
          shoots out of several vents along the wall. The colorless
          gas hits them and they instantly gag, choking for air.
          With the slanted walls of the tank, there seems to be no
          escape, but TANAKA runs up the wall, diving and grabbing onto
          a pipe, climbing upward toward the catwalk.
          The shadowed FIGURE (LELAND) quickly hobbles to the railing.

                         LELAND
          No, no, no. Back in der' big boy!

                         CONTINUED:
          LELAND uses a spear to jab TANAKA'S hand. He loses his grip
          and tumbles back to the bottom of the tank. BOWER pulls
          NADIR out of the way of the hatch.

                         BOWER
          Get back! BACK!
          BOWER whirls the magneto lever on the weapon and he raises
          the barrel towards the hatch, nearly point blank.
          KA-CRAAAACK! The energy blast from the weapon hits the hatch
          like a lightening bolt sending a tremendous JOLT through the
          entire tank. A spark IGNITES the chemical gas and there's a
          BURST of flammable gas that rolls upward into the catwalks.
          LELAND is knocked off his feet and he GASPS with shock.

                         LELAND
          Whoa... WHOA! What the hell was that!?
          LELAND is exposed from his hiding place, waving the smoke
          from his face, bewildered. He's an older man who's lost all
          vanity over survival. A thin-framed, spidery little man with
          assorted clothing and a clutter of tools on his belt.

                         LELAND (CONT'D)
          What did you do!?
          BOWER whirls the lever on the weapon and points it at him.

                         BOWER
          Shut off the gas!

                         LELAND
          Where did you get that?
          BOWER angles the barrel towards a vent blowing out the
          chemical gas and LELAND jumps with fright.

                         LELAND (CONT'D)

          NO-NO! HO-HO!

                         BOWER

          SHUT IT OFF!
          LELAND scampers across the catwalk and quickly lifts levers
          and twists nozzles, shutting off the flow of chemical gas.
          His frown transforms to a grin, raising an eye brow as he
          stares into the barrel of BOWER'S weapon.

          CLICKITY-CLICKITY-CLANK? LELAND cranks an energy lever that

          widening their view of the unusual living space. Several
          crates and an assortment of mechanical junk and supplies.

          pet the rat, it's not mine. Just
          watching it for a friend.
          LELAND is excited to have guests as he runs along the
          catwalks, lighting candles and sealing valves. They watch
          him with leery suspicion, weapons still in hand.

                         BOWER
          You... live here?

                         LELAND
          Sublet. Got a roomier flat in the bow
          for the off season, but from here, ya
          just can't beat the commute.
          He grins, expecting a laugh, but doesn't get one. LELAND
          eyes BOWER over, admiring the uniform.

          You really a flyer, or did ya grab that
          off the rack? i didn't think there was
          any crew left.

          Captain? Where!?

                         LELAND
          Umm, up on B-Deck. Some on C. A few
          pieces on the promenade and I think his
          nuts are in the foose-ball game in the
          rec room.

          bunk. Three singles or will a queen do?
          LELAND laughs to himself, digging through supplies. BOWER
          scans the walls, seeing no way up to the catwalks.

          to the dust bug and who knows where yawl
          have been. No offense. There's

          let that spoil the party. Here...
          LELAND lowers down a bin filled with assorted food items,
          using a wire to drop it to them. TANAKA sniffs it with
          suspicion.

          INT. WATER PROCESSOR - LATER

          A small propane flame is lit. LELAND hovers over a make-
          shift stove, heating a can of water. He pours in some powder
          and stirs it up with the meticulous nature of a chef
          preparing fine cuisine.

                         LELAND
          It's tough to properly season with a
          motor oil base. But if you use your
          imagination, kinda tastes like...

                         (SIP)
          Herb and garlic dog shit.
          Below the catwalks, TANAKA has found a spot to rest, NADIR is
          using water to clean a wound and BOWER is peering through a
          slit in a vent.

                         BOWER
          How long have you been awake?

                         LELAND
          Mmmm. Lemme think. What's today,
          Tuesday? That would be about, mmm...
          He counts in his head and across his fingers, carefully
          calculating, then a grin.

                         LELAND (CONT'D)
          No idea.
          He turns back to his make-shift stove, chuckling to himself.

                         LELAND (CONT-D)
          I quit counting after the band broke up,
          ooooh twenty... thirty years ago.
          BOWER and NADIR exchange a look of uncertainty. The
          classical music begins to SKIP and without even looking
          LELAND kicks a piece of equipment, correcting the music.

                         LELAND (CONT-D)
          Then again, an hour in this place feels
          more like... one-fifteen, one-twenty.

          strongly worded letter to the airline.

          LELAND sets several bowls of soup into the bin and lowers it
          to them with the cable. T_ANAKA is the only one interested,
          sniffing the soup with a glare. LELAND winks.
          BOWER takes a seat, showing exhaustion and defeat.

                         BOWER
          Those things out there. Could it have
          been something... that crawled out of
          your lab? Something that-

                         NADIA
          No. That's... not possible.

                         BOWER
          Then something got on board. Some kind
          of life form. Something that-

                         NADIA
          Or something that was already on board,
          with us in the hyper-bunks.

                         BOWER
          What does that mean?

                         NADIR
          it could have been the accelerator.

                         BOWER
          What?

                         NADIA
          It's the only theory I can come up with.
          The synthetic enzyme in our feeding
          tubes. The accelerator that would help
          our bodies adjust and adapt to the
          environmental conditions on Tanis. From
          what I've seen... these things have
          adapted... to the ship instead.

                         BOWER
          But, why would- You're saying we'll
          become like them? Why would they be
          affected like that and we're not-

                         NADIA

          GALLO'S gaze is hollow and translucent as he stares through
          the glass porthole in the empty sleep chamber, his mind is
          deeply pondering. Pupils dilated.

                         ANGLE ON
          GALLO is looking at the empty sleep chambers while PAYTON
          remains at the control console, determined not to give up on
          contacting BOWER.

                         GALLO
          Do you know the symptoms of Pandorum?

                         PAYTON
          What?

                         GALLO
          Orbital Dysfunctional Syndrome.

                         GALLO
          It's not something you can easily detect.
          Starts with a shiver. An itch. A slow
          boil... and without being able to get off
          the ship... there's no shutting off the
          heat. It'll boil over, no matter what
          you do.
          GALLO is slowly pacing the room and PAYTON watches him with
          uneasiness out of the corner of his eye.

                         GALLO (CONT'D)
          You don't believe me.

          How could they both have had it? The
          odds are insurmountable.

          It has an emotional trigger effect.

          That's what they say.
          GALLO slowly rubs his temples, with hesitation.

                         GALLO

          you knew the truth?

          realizes they're crawling down a long ladder.
          They reach the bottom level where a distant RUMBLE has grown
          louder. They follow the sound through a field of debris to a
          clear path leading to an open hatchway.
          BOWER checks the marker over the door and leads them down the
          corridor, preparing to step through and TANAKA grabs him,

          The FIGURE is forced to climb down, hopping to the floor,
          BOWER waits with his gun raised. Out of the shadows steps...
          A ten-year-old CHILD HUNTER.
          BOWER flinches with shock. The CHILD is a younger version of
          the hunters, awkward physique, pale skin coated with
          hydraulic fluid, oblong shaped head, eyes hidden in shadow.
          NADIR lowers her weapon.

                         NADIA

                         (DEVASTATED)
          Oh... my... God...
          The CHILD suddenly crouches in a fighting stance with a
          i gargled HISS from its throat, the light catching its eyes to
          reveal WHITE RETINAS deeply hidden under a thin membrane of
          I skin. Everyone is too stunned to react except for TANAKA,
           who instantly raises his weapon, preparing to kill it.

                          NADIA (CONT-D)
           stop it! STOP IT! Are you crazy? It's
           just a child!

                         BOWER
          Child! ? That's no child! What the hell
          is it!?
          TANAKA lunges, but NADIA blocks his attack. The CHILD HUNTER
          erupts with a horrific SCREECH, HISSING at them before
          turning and leaping back up and over the rafters,
          disappearing into the shadows. They are speechless.

                         LELAND
          Not as cute when they're little, are
          they?
          TANAKA runs after it. It takes a moment for the rest to
          react, chasing after.

          The CHILD runs up a wall of tubing and ducks through a small
          hole punctured in the vents. TANAKA sighs with defeat.

                         NADIA
          My God. They're... breeding.

                         BOWER
          What!? What do you mean they? How could
          they- That's impossible.
          It appears the CHILD has alerted his group as the BLUISH GLOW
          of flame can be seen growing stronger in the corridor, the
          sounds of CACKLES and HISSES approaching.

                         LELAND
          Little bastard rang the bell.
          They all quickly turn back, running down a side corridor and
          into...

          They crouch and hide inside a smaller compartment as... the
          BLUISH GLOW passes outside the doorway. The CHILD appears to
          be leading the group, silhouettes passing, more HUNTERS then
          they've ever seen together before.
          They silently share the horror of the possible numbers
          they're up against.

                         LELAND
          This isn't going to work. Too many of
          them. Have to turn back.

                         NADIA
          There's no where to turn back to. We
          can't give up-

                         LELAND
          Told you this wouldn't fly.

                         NADIA
          You didn't tell us anything. You never
          said that. You said you'd love to come-

          They watch and wait as the shadows move past the doorway with
          the GLOW of BLUISH TORCHES and vocal CACKLES.

          PAYTON is pulling wires out from under the console and going
          to the sealed doors where he's pulled apart the control
          panel, preparing for a hot-wire.
          GALLO watches him while slowly pacing the room.

                         GALLO
          What are you doing?

                         PAYTON
          I think the direct channels are fried.
          I'm gonna run a patch so we can get this
          door open as soon as we're back on-line.

                         PAYTON
          The bridge. As soon as we're up we'll be
          able to take control of guidance. But
          only from on the bridge.
          GALLO continues pacing, throwing glances toward the empty
          sleep chambers.

                         GALLO
          This ship is not dying.
          PAYTON refuses to look to GALLO, continuing his work.

                         GALLO (CONT'D)
          It's already dead. You really believe
          that kid will be able to save this ship?

                         PAYTON
          He can do it.

                         GALLO
          Twelve hours ago, he didn't know his own
          name. Now, you think he's ready to re-

                         PAYTON
          He's the only shot we have. Gotta have a
          little faith.

                         GALLO

          actually say that with a straight face?
          A little faith?

          The GLOW of the HUNTERS slowly begins to fade from sight as
          BOWER notices what he's hiding behind is an empty sleep
          chamber, coated with dried blood and signs of violence. He
          looks to the labelled name plates with a frown and wanders
          deeper into the room.
          NADIA follows him with a frown as LELAND and TANAKA remain
          poised with weapons near the doorway.
          BOWER'S walk slows as he moves past rows of sleep chambers,
          nearly all of them have been opened and signs of violent
          deaths left dried and splattered across the floor.

          That's why I came. There was nothing

          Well, then... she saved your life.
          BOWER frowns on the thought, slowly nodding in agreement.
          His eyes look to the label of the chamber he was led to, the
          label reads; M. PAYTON. He mumbles to himself, memory

          thing shuts down, we're as good as dead.
          Nothing on this ship will ever turn on

          We can still launch ourselves in the
          pods. Before the ignition systems are

          descent down the walls of the reactor bay wall. Clinging
          onto the pipes and railings of the catwalks, the odd-colored
          algae grows more and more dense... a dim glow slowly coming
          into view from below.
          With a gap in the catwalk, BOWER leaps across, nearly losing
          his grip. He looks down to see an odd pattern of white
          shapes near the bottom.
          Squinting into the darkness, he's unable to make out what
          he's looking at and he manages to crawl down further,
          reaching a gangplank that crosses to the towering reactor.
          He motions for NADIA and TANAKA to stay put and begins
          crawling across... towards a darkened control panel.

          LELAND is nervously watching from above, leaning further over
          the railing and... a pen-lamp slips free from his belt.
          The pen-lamp CLANKS off one of the catwalks and tumbles past
          BOWER... dropping to the bottom... hitting the floor and
          illuminating the strange white objects covering the floor
          as... DOZENS of HUNTERS, all sleeping. Their pale white
          bodies are intertwined and over-lapped resembling an orgy of
          the living dead.

                         CHRIST ALMIGHTY-
          The fall of the pen-lamp causes one HUNTER to instantly
          spring to its feet, lifting its nose towards the air like a
          guard dog checking the scent.
          BOWER remains frozen, gripping the gangplank that hangs
          twenty feet above the field of sleeping HUNTERS.
          I Slowly the HUNTER returns to sleep, slithering its way back
          into the folds of flesh and BOWER continues his crawl
          across... reaching the control panel.
          Upon seeing the sleeping HUNTERS, LELAND fearfully backs
          away, exiting the room. NADIA and TANAKA grip the ladders,
          watching BOWER, holding their breath in fright.

          BOWER grabs a vine, but it breaks away and he dangles over
          the side, losing his grip. NADIA jumps across the gap and
          climbs down, extending her weapon for him to grab. Together
          they cling to the side of the reactor and BOWER taps the
          control panel switches and... nothing.
          His eyes widen with horror, quickly searching for a solution.
          He slowly pumps a primer switch and... the light panel
          flickers gently under centuries of dust and vegetation...

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK

          A light gently blinks on the control console and PAYTON spots
          it with a frown, running back from the door.

                         PAYTON
          He's in! That's the reactor's activator
          panel. We're going to make it out of

          this. Trust me.
          No response. GALLO'S shadow moves behind him, his voice
          taking on a slight raspier and "older" tone.

                         I

                         GALLO
          Trust you? How can I trust someone who
          isn't even honest with himself. Tell me?
          PAYTON refuses to acknowledge him, continuing to monitor the
          control panel. He discreetly slides his hand closer to the
          pipe weapon as he senses GALLO'S presence behind him.

                         PAYTON
          Gallo... you have to listen to me...
          Carefully. You don't haveâ€¢to-
          GALLO steps closer behind him, his shadowed outline showing
          an imposing posture, his voice is forced and unsteady.

                         GALLO
          Don't do that.
          TRAP... TRAP... THAP. Blood drops hit the floor heavily.

                         PAYTON
          Don't... do what?
          PAYTON slides his hand further across the console, reaching
          for the pipe weapon, eyes on the screen.

          Don't talk to me like some child that
          needs reassurance. Think I don't know
          the risks? Think I don't know this ship?

                         PAYTON
          Take it easy-
          GALLO'S presence is felt behind him, his voice seeming to
          grow raspier and uneven with breath, anger simmering.

                         GALLO
          I know this ship and what she's capable
          of better then anyone. I know her... and
          I know what she can and can't do.

                         PAYTON
          Easy...

                         GALLO
          And this... she can't do! Why are we
          even arguing. You know it-

                         PAYTON
          I'm giving you an order...

                         GALLO
          You wanna stay here to die, that's your

                         GALLO

          NOT MINE!
          PAYTON shoves himself out of his chair, reaching for the pipe
          weapon to find nothing! He spins to see GALLO holding the
          pipe and the pistol-gripped syringe, glaring down at him.
          The heavy streams of blood are oozing from his nose and ears,
          insanity shown in his hollow gaze.

          GALLO (CONT`D)
          Who's being irrational here, Lieutenant?
          Tell me? Who's being delusional!? Hmm?
          PAYTON raises his hands, calmly submitting.

                         PAYTON

          BOWER and NADIA cling to the side of the reactor, quietly
          flipping switches and entering codes as... the sea of HUNTERS
          sleep below them.
          BOWER unfolds the auxiliary power lever, each movement
          creating a CREAK of rusted metal. He grips the handle and
          slowly begins to turn the magneto crank. The CREAKS of
          rusted metal and the low WHINE of magnetos grows louder.
          HUNTERS begin to stir in their sleep as NADIA watches them
          with fright.

          GALLO is jabbing the pistol-gripped syringe towards PAYTON,
          motioning him closer to the sleep pods. He motions and
          PAYTON kneels at the panel... entering the code.

                         PAYTON
          This won't work...

                         GALLO
          Shut-up.
          GALLO jabs the syringe gun towards the back of PAYTON'S head
          while putting one foot inside the pod.

                         PAYTON
          just think about what you're doing-

                         GALLO

          PAYTON continues entering the launch code as GALLO steps
          inside with his other foot.

                         PAYTON
          It wasn't the crew that was sick, was it?

          PAYTON hits a key and LIGHTS BLINK. GALLO looks away for a
          second and PAYTON suddenly grabs the hatch lever... SLAMMING
          it closed. He cranks the latch, locking GALLO inside.

                         GALLO (CONT-D)

          WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?
          PAYTON wedges a pipe through the handle as GALLO violently
          kicks the hatch.

          GALLO EXPLODES with RAGE... POUNDING on the hatch with a jack-
          hammer of fists, bones shattering in his own hands. PAYTON
          ignores his screams, going back to the console and typing
          I into the keyboard.

          INT. REACTOR CONTROL TERMINAL

          BOWER cranks the hand lever faster and faster, the MOAN of
          magnetos growing louder and louder. He gives one last spin
          and hits the primer switch. A split-second of nothing and
          then the panels brightly come to life. The digital panel
          reads: >> ROTATION SEQUENCE >> CODE INITIATE TO PROCEED >>
          BOWER takes a sigh of relief and glances to see NADIA is
          frozen with fright. He follows their eye-line to see the
          entire floor of HUNTERS are awake, heads turned towards them.
          HEFLIN steps closer in their direction with a HISS.
          BOWER gasps and the entire pack of HUNTERS moves toward them
          and... suddenly, TANAKA bangs his bladed weapon against the
          railing with a heavy CLANK! The HUNTERS instantly turn
          toward his direction and TANAKA throws his weapon, HITTING
          one of the HUNTERS directly in the head.
          TANAKA jumps to the neighboring catwalk and breaks through a
          hatch, coated with vines and vegetation. HEFLIN screeches a
          command and the HUNTERS ignite in a chain-reaction, grabbing
          their weapons and taking chase like a swarm of attack dogs.
          They climb the wall with inhuman speed and rush out the
          hatch, following TANAKA.

                         NADIA
          Hurry! Go!
          BOWER turns back to the panel, flipping more switches and

          equipment and weaving through debris as the pack of enraged
          HUNTERS emerge from every direction to follow his path.
          One HUNTER gains quickly at a sprinter's pace and TANAKA runs
          directly for the open hatchway. (The hatchway they detoured
          earlier.) He dives through as the sprinting HUNTER is almost
          upon him.
          A booby-trap is sprung, hydraulic pistons SNAP a razor-wire
          that "clotheslines" the HUNTER, nearly ripping him in half as
          TANAKA hits the floor, rolls to his feet and keeps running.
          HEFLIN and the HUNTERS slash the tangled snare with their
          weapons, trying to break through.

          waiting to pounce. With nowhere to go, they are done for as
          WEASEL CACKLES a command, the HUNTERS moving in, just as...

          Where do you think you're going?

                         PAYTON

                         QUIET-
          PAYTON continues to work the control panels, looking to the
          sealed door on the other end of the room.

                         GALLO
          Think about what you're doing, sir-

                         PAYTON

                         SHUT-UP-
          GALLO pushes his knees against the hatch, the pipe beginning
          to bend, the seal CRACKING open.

                         GALLO
          You don't want to see what's in there-

                         PAYTON

                         SHUT-UP;

                         CUT TO:

          INT. SLEEP CRAMBER/MAIN CORRIDOR

          The control panel on a sleep-chamber is FLASHING as a
          passenger KICKS his hatch open from the inside. The haggard
          and bewildered passenger crawls out to find himself in the
          middle of CHAOS. Before he can get a breath he's attacked by

          HUNTERS.
          What was once a dark and haunting chamber of metal, is now a
          disco tech from hell as lights FLASH across the corridor in
          what appears to be a massive riot, PASSENGERS and HUNTERS
          fighting.

          ANGLE ON/CRANE UP
          BOWER and NADIA run across the top of the sleep chamber wall,
          thirty feet above the havoc that's ensuing below. A LIGHT
          BULBS BURST as...

          MATCH CUT TO:

          INT_ ATRIUM - CONT.
          Metal blades SPARK as they connect between HEFLIN and TANAKA.
          The sword play is crude, but powerful and brutal. HEFLIN
          can't match his skills and pile-drives him, ripping into him
          with his own bare hands and a horrific SCREECH.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          TANAKA tries to grab a hold of him, but HEFLIN digs in with
          his teeth, biting into his stomach. TANAKA screams, hitting
          HEFLIN'S head with everything he's got, but he won't let go.
          TANAKA lifts HEFLIN'S feet and ROARS as he charges himself
          directly into the wall, neck bones SNAPPING! HEFLIN goes
          limp, dropping to the floor dead as TANAKA gasps... looking
          down to see the damage has been done, blood flowing heavily.
          He takes a breath, turns to exit FREEZING to see... the CHILD
          HUNTER standing alone, sensing the death of HEFLIN with
          almost an expression of sorrow. TANAKA lowers his weapon
          and... THWACK! The CHILD stabs TANAKA in the chest with a
          small bladed weapon.
          TANAKA gasps with shock, collapsing to his knees, eyes wide
          before going to the floor. The CHILD begins to feed.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/MAIN CORRIDOR

          BOWER and NADIA climb to a cat-walk only to see HUNTERS are
          following their trail. They run to a ladder and spot LELAND
          already climbing above them.

                         BOWER
          Go... GO! GO!
          Half way up, LELAND looks back to see them coming with
          HUNTERS close behind. He gives them a look before closing
          the hatch and latching it.

                         NADIA
          You snake bastard- OPEN IT!

                         CUT TO:

          INT. CORRIDOR - CONT.

          With the YELLS muffled under the hatch, LELAND runs towards
          an open door at the far end of the long corridor.

                         ANGLE ON
          Inside the door at the far end... PAYTON is at the control
          console, quickly typing into the keyboard. He hears the
          E hatch CRACK open and he spins to see GALLO, out of the pod,
          with a twisted grin, holding the pistol-gripped syringe.

                         GALLO
          We both know who needs this shot...

          PAYTON counters with the bladed weapon.

                         PAYTON

                         STAY BACK-

                         GALLO
          Who's the one suffering... sir-

                         PAYTON

          I MEAN IT!
          PAYTON lunges with the weapon, RAGE in his EYES as... GALLO
          jabs with the pistol-syringe, they lock hands, grabbing one
          anothers wrists... slamming into the wall.
          Upon IMPACT with the wall, GALLO suddenly appears slightly
          older, his voice lowering in level.

                         GALLO
          Corporal...
          PAYTON slams him against the wall, making him older.

                         PAYTON

                         (RAGE SIMMERING)

          STOP IT!
          PAYTON slams him again, a FLASH that reveals GALLO has aged
          almost matching PAYTON, their voices sounding the same...

                         GALLO
          Your mind... has turned against itself,

                         CORPORAL-

                         PAYTON
          I'll FUCKING CARVE YOU UP!
          Within the struggle, hands grab at weapons, a wrist is
          twisted... lining up both of their identification tattoos to
          be identical... FLT>>004>>012>>.
          The syringe is stabbed into skin. The trigger fires liquid,
          injecting the chemical into someone's arm as their voices
          converge, over-lapping at first and becoming one voice...

                         GALLO & PAYTON
          It's for the best... Corporal.

                         I

                         ANGLE ON
          LELAND runs up the corridor, through the doors and into the
          room, gasping for breath, pausing to see...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          116.

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          PAYTON is ALONE. He's just injected the syringe into his own
          wrist. He's the only person in the room. Heavy blood
          streams are running from his nose and ears.
          Y77e will now refer to PAYTON by his real name, GALLO.
          LELAND and GALLO exchange a look... GALLO seeming to snap out
          of his trance. LELAND approaches, wheezing for air.

                         LELAND
          We made it! We- I'm with your boy. I
          was the one helping with-
          GALLO suddenly SLASHES his throat! LELAND reels back in
          shock, throttling his own neck in horror, blood gushing.
          GALLO casually turns back to the console, continuing to type
          as LELAND tries to cry out, his voice gargled with blood as
          he staggers, collapsing to the floor. GALLO hits a key and
          LIGHTS IGNITE, the last door finally engaging.
          GALLO sigh with relief as the doors slide open revealing a
          corridor of stairs leading to the bridge. A warm and gentle
          smile widens on his face.

                         I PAYTON
          Captain on the bridge.
          He heads toward the bridge, while flipping another switch
          that ignites the opposite doors just as...

                         ANGLE ON
          BOWER and NADIA angrily burst through the hatch in the floor,
          jamming it behind them and run up the corridor. They see the
          doors sliding shut.

                         BOWER
          That's it! GO! Go for it!
          With HUNTERS hot on their trail... they run full sprint
          towards the sliding doors. HUNTERS lunge out of side
          corridors with SCREECHING HISSES as BOWER and NADIA dive
          through the sliding doors...
          One HUNTER is crushed by the doors., split nearly in half with
          a heavy THUD of steel and a MOAN of hydraulics. The HUNTER
          spasms wildly, kicking and clawing as BOWER and NADIA back
          pedal into the room. HUNTERS gather at the gap, stabbing
          weapons between the doors, trying to crawl through with
          SCREECHES and HISSES of rage.

                         CONTINUED: ( 3)
          BOWER and NADIA back further away, turning to see the room.
          The original room that BOWER woke up in now looks quite
          different with all the systems engaged, BLINDING LIGHT coming
          from the monitors and computer terminals.
          They move through the room, passing the empty sleep chambers
          and the control console, seeing the entire pathway of dripped
          blood across the floor.

                         NADIA
          Where's... your lieutenant?

                         BOWER
          He's not my lieutenant.
          She frowns off his look and turns to see... LELAND on the
          floor in a pool of blood, throat slashed, dead.
          BOWER pulls the gun and heads into the open doorway leading
          towards the bridge as NADIA follows behind.

                         FOLLOW THRU:

          INT. COMMAND BRIDGE - CONT.

          A tunneled stairwell widens out into the main flight bridge.
          A stunning sight, a split-level glass control deck, rows of
          blinking control panels and flight chairs. It appears
          undisturbed, a thin layer of silt floats out from under their
          footsteps.
          BOWER leads the way, panning the weapon throughout the room
          with no sign of GALLO. On the far wall; cockpit windows
          coated with a black fungus that obscures the view, but hints
          to the illusion of outer space, a haze of cosmic dust without
          stars.

                         NADIA

                         (IN AWE)
          What's happened... to us? Where are we?
          BOWER goes to the nearest control console, tapping the
          keyboard. The computer instantly responds, data scrolling
          across the screen.

                         BOWER
          Flight log. It'll tell us how long we've
          I been out... and how far we've gone.
          BOWER types in a command and the computer begins to scroll
          through the flight computer's time-code. Starting with the
          launch date and time the numbers begin to roll faster and
          faster. BLIP... BLIP... BLIP.

                         CONTINUED:
          NADIA walks towards the windows and suddenly jumps back with
          fright to realize one of the flight control chairs has a
          FIGURE sitting in it. GALLO, motionless and gazing toward
          the windows.
          Off her gasp, BOWER grabs his gun and approaches as the
          computer time-code continues to roll even faster with no sign
          of slowing... months becoming years.
          BOWER approaches from behind GALLO... his identification
          tatto now clearly visible... FLT>>004>>012>>. He cranks the
          lever on the gun with a WHINE of magnetos and the laser
          sights flare brightly onto GALLO'S back.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          Seems my little memory lapse has finally
          worn off... "Lieutenant".
          BOWER slowly approaches, moving closer to his profile, the
          stream of blood from GALLO'S ear shown running down his neck.

                         GALLO

                         (DRYLY)
          Mine too.

                         BOWER
          Who the hell are you?
          GALLO keeps his gaze towards the windows, emotionless.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          You're team four. Why would you...
          switch bunks? Pretend to be someone
          else? What would you be wanting to hide?
          Who the hell are you?

                         GALLO
          I was younger then you when I first came
          on board. Funny, I can't even remember
          what it was like... before this flight
          began. It's all I know.

                         BOWER
          You were the one... who first received
          the final transmission. Who refused to
          go back to sleep. You stayed awake...
          for all those years. What were you
          doing... what crimes were you hiding from
          when you took Payton's bunk?
          The time-code display rolls faster, years rolling into
          decades... BLIP, BLIP, BLIP.

          How the hell would you know all that?

                         BOWER
          Is it true? What have you done to us?
          Where are we now?
          GALLO lazily nods towards the windows.

                         GALLO
          Go ahead. Take a peek. You tell me.
          BOWER hesitates, looking toward the darkened windows. He
          stays with the weapon on GALLO as NADIA wanders toward the
          front control console, towards the glass.
          With the lights fading on the weapon, BOWER gives the lever a
          quick whirl, motioning the barrel closer.

          GALLO (CONT ' D )
          What are. you gonna do, Bower? There's no
          one left to hand out merit badges. No
          one left at all.

                         BOWER
          And that makes it okay? To play God?

                         GALLO
          You think God survived? He's gone...
          with the rest. There's no one left to
          judge you, Bower.
          NADIA approaches the glass, squinting towards the heavily
          smudged glass. She frowns, trying to wipe away the layer of
          sludge.

                         BOWER
          Judgement will come for you. You think
          you could cover it? Your victims
          survived. Evolved. That's your creation
          out there. Your crime.
          BOWER jabs the gun into his back with force.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          And you thought you'd be able to hide it?
          Who would ever suspect that? Who would
          ever remember? I remember.
          NADIA rubs the glass with her hand, squinting into the
          darkness. The time-code display rolls faster, decades into
          centuries... BLIP, BLIP, BLIP.

          us. You the law now? You gonna be the
          one that brings order to what's left?
          Wanna take a shot at it? I did my best
          with what I was given. Wanna be King for

          like to see how you fare.
          With the laser sights fading on the weapon, BOWER quickly
          cranks the power lever, keeping the gun raised-
          A slow grin spreads across GALLO'S face as he finally looks
          to him, revealing the thick streams of blood that have
          dripped from his nose, coating his chin and neck.

          GALLO (CONT`D)
          Try to imagine it. Imagine... yourself
          for five minutes without morality. I'll

          Shut-up.

                         (TO NADIA)
          What's out there?
          NADIA shakes her head, rubbing away the sludge from the
          glass, squinting harder.

                         GALLO
          Imagine... us both. What's left to stop
          you? I offer you the kingdom and you-

                         BOWER

                         SHUT-UP-

                         GALLO
          There's still quite a few sleeping
          beauties down there... a thousand
          flavors. You up for a little window
          shopping?

                         BOWER
          Shut-up!

                         GALLO
          (licking his lips)
          I wanna see it. I'll bet you'd be a

                         REEEEAL TIGER-
          BOWER suddenly shoves him out of the chair, slamming him to
          the floor, jabbing the barrel into the back of his neck.

                         BOWER
          There will be law... in whatever world we
          create. And you'll pay for what you've
          done. Believe me.
          GALLO chuckles with his face pressed to the floor.

                         GALLO
          A real boy scout, is that it, kiddo?

                         BOWER

          HEAR ME ASSHOLE?!
          NADIA suddenly GASPS... flinching away from the cockpit
          windows, having just seen what's outside. Her expression is
          ghostly as she back pedals.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          What is it?
          GALLO looks up with a blood-soaked grin.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          What do you see!?

                         I

                         GALLO
          You ready for the new world, corporal?
          BOWER keeps the gun on him as he goes to the windows. NADIA
          has a ghostly expression, unable to speak. BOWER leans
          toward the glass, squinting into the darkness and...
          SWISH! An object moves past the outside of the glass. He
          leans closer, squinting to see... a school of ALIEN FISH dart
          past. The shin is underwater.
          BOWER staggers in shock, back pedalling as GALLO continues to
          chuckle.

                         BOWER

                         (DISBELIEF)
          We've... we've already crashed. We've
          already... we're...
          The time-code display rolls centuries past, more then a
          thousand years accounted for as it finally slows to a stop.

          BLIP... BLIP... BLIP.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          We've been... down here... all this
          time!? All this... time-

                         CONTINUED: (5)
          BOWER staggers against the console in shock,. the weapon
          lowering to his side.

                         GALLO
          I guess this thing does land itself.
          Just doesn't float too well.
          BOWER lunges towards him and GALLO is ready for this one,
          quickly countering his move and SLAMMING BOWER into the
          console. He unleashes a vicious BLOW into BOWER'S throat.
          BOWER collapses, choking for air and GALLO kicks the gun
          away. He kneels over BOWER, slowly pulling out a blade.

          G_ALLO (CONT'D)
          And you thought you could be King!?
          He slides the blade under BOWER'S neck and... there's a WHIRL
          of magnetos.
          He looks up to see NADIA cranking the lever on the energy
          gun. She tries to turn the gun towards him and...

                         I
          GALLO lunges toward her just as she's able to FIRE! The
          BLA..ST of energy goes into the console with a CRACK of
          1 THUNDER, knocking everyone off their feet. Shattered glass
          and metal HIT the cockpit window like a spray of shrapnel...

                         CLOSE UP
          .sending a thin crack across the surface of the glass.
          She struggles to crank the lever again as GALLO charges,
          hitting the gun away. He SLAMS her over the console.

                         GALLO (CONT'D)
          My apologies. Ladies first... of course.

          ANGLE ON/CLOSE UP
          The crack on the window begins to spiderweb across...

                         ANGLE ON
          GALLO grabs her hair to expose her neck and angles the blade
          upward, forcing her to take a GASP as...
          BOSSSH! Water explodes through the windows, hitting the room
          like a hundred fire hoses. GALLO is hit directly and thrown
          across the room as NADIA and BOWER are engulfed by the blast
          of black water, sent tumbling.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          123.

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK - CONT.

          The tremendous ROAR of rushing water rolls them down the
          stairwell and into the sleep chamber compartment in a raging
          torrent, a tidal wave slams into the wall.
          BOWER grabs onto NADIA and they claw themselves along the
          wall as computer terminals SPARK and LIGHTS go black. He
          pulls her to a sleep-chamber and he jumps inside the open
          hatch, pulling her with.

                         NADIA
          NO!? Are you crazy-

                         BOWER

          GET IN!
          He pulls her inside and turns to the control panel. He hits
          the keypad to read: >>> DETACHMENT INITIATED >>>
          BOWER struggles to close the hatch as water rushes in,
          SLAMMING it shut on top of them.
          GALLO struggles to keep his head above water as the fast
          moving current SLAMS him into the edge of the doorway. His
          I fingers claw at the manual lever for the door, tugging and
          tugging with no effect as the water rises above his head.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER

          BOWER and NADIA are squeezed together inside the pod as water
          quickly rises above the porthole.

                         NADIA

                         (GASPING)
          Not like this! I can't- like this!

                         BOWER
          Hold on!
          Under the roar of the rushing water, hydraulics ignite.
          Micro-jets FIRE and WHOOSH! The pod launches, shooting down
          a tunnel until they're HIT with a tremendous JOLT.
          They are sent spinning into a wild tumble as bubbles and gas
          erupt across the outer surface. BOWER and NADIA slam into
          one another as the chamber turns end over end.
          Its roll seems to slow for a brief moment and BOWER squints
          toward the porthole to see...

                         POV
          They are pulling away from the side of the ship. The
          exterior hull of the massive space ship slides past at a high
          rate of speed with a swirl of ocean water and bubbles.
          BAM! The pod SLAMS into something as SPARKS fly and seals
          are ruptured as WATER sprays in with a blinding BLAST. The
          chamber is sent into another violent roll as NADIA and BOWER
          tumble head over feet, as if caught within a washing machine.
          The chamber finally steadies as water washes across the
          control panel, one last burst of sparks knocks out the
          lights, taking them into BLACK.
          Only their gasps are heard as they squirm towards the upper
          corner... only a foot of air remaining.
          He grabs the mask connected to tubes in the side and pulls
          the straps over her head.

                         NADIA
          I What are you doing!?

                         BOWER
          1 Put it on!

                         NADIA
          No! I can't- Not like this! I'm not
          going to wake up and drowned-

                         BOWER

          PUT IT ON!
          He pulls it over her face as the water rises with only
          several inches of air inside the chamber. BOWER gasps
          desperately into the corner.
          NADIA gasps the air through the mask, making her eye-lids
          droop, slowly going unconscious. BOWER gasps one last breath
          and the water rises over his head.
          BOWER watches her body go limp and squirms for air as... a
          warm GLOW of WHITE LIGHT grows brighter through the porthole.
          As sunlight dances through the porthole, he kicks at the
          hatch and...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - DAY

          BOWER kicks open the hatch, gasping for breath. A gentle
          breeze ripples across the water with a sunlight flickering
          across the surface of an ocean.
          He pulls NADIA out of the chamber, ripping the mask off her
          face. Her eye-lids slowly begin to flicker back to
          consciousness.

                         BOWER
          Hey...? Hey?
          She chokes on the air and struggles to orientate herself,
          looking up to see him gazing down at her, coated with bright
          sunlight.

                         NADIA

                         (GASPING)
          Where are we? What happened?

                         BOWER

                         (GRIN)
          It's all right. It's safe to wake up
          this time.

                         I
          With eyes of disbelief, they turn to see...

                         WIDE ANGLE
          They sit on the edge of the sleep chamber as it lightly bobs
          within the ocean waves. They're just off shore from a
          stretch of mountainous tropical islands with waves crashing
          against the beaches. The unusual shape of the islands and
          their geography are nothing like we've ever seen on Earth.
          Several moons dot the sky and the sun is rising with a
          brilliant glow on the horizon.

          FADE TO BLACK:

          INT. COMMAND DECK

          Pitch black. A low CHURNING is heard, a motor that is
          pumping as the water lowers, allowing us to see across the
          dishevelled command platform, the walls dripping with water.
          The water is being drained through the grates in the floor as
          unseen bilge pumps are heard loudly WHIRLING. The pump
          motors whine down and shut off as...

                         CONTROL CONSOLE
          A hand flips off the switch for the ventilation ducts. It's

                         CONTINUED:
          standing at the console, having changed clothes and recovered
          from the ordeal. He examines the empty tank where BOWER'S
          sleep chamber once sat. He eyes the other sleep-chambers,
          deeply contemplating.
          He goes back to the control console, scanning across the
          numerous surveillance monitors that reveal...
          PASSENGERS and HUNTERS engaged in a variety of activities all
          across the ship. Some are seen fighting, some searching for
          food, some searching for a way out, some alone weeping. A
          kingdom, for the taking.
          He pulls out a coffee packet and slowly begins mixing himself
          a cup, deeply contemplating as he looks across the screens.
          He glances over to see... YOUNG GALLO, the younger version of
          himself, who is seated nearby, watching with a grin. The
          blood is gone from his face, appearing clean-cut, clean
          uniform.

                         YOUNG GALLO
          Well, if you're gonna be captain... what
          are we gonna do now?
          Off his look...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT - LATER

          SHUSH... THUD. Doors open to another sleep chamber
          compartment, completely undisturbed. Four undisturbed sleep-
          chambers are lined against the wall.
          GALLO enters, now wearing the CAPTAIN'S uniform, he
          straightens his collar and kneels next to one of the pods,
          typing into the panel. A grin appears as he removes the
          wedding ring (PAYTON'S ring) he'd forgotten he's still
          wearing.

                         GALLO
          What is a King... without his Queen.
          He hits the control panel switch and...

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER

          A FEMALE CREW MEMBER, a beautiful young woman, deep in hyper--
          slumber suddenly twitches... her EYES opening wide with a
          GASP as she stares into CAMERA.
