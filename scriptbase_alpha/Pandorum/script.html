</b>



                                 Written by

                                Travis Milloy


                         

                         

<b>                         DEEP SPACE
</b>
          A darkness like no other, a silence that is unsettling.
          Sharp pinholes of light show a sea of distant stars across
          the void of outer space. Our own motion is only realized as
          an enormous object slowly moves towards us, taking shape.
          A SPACE SHIP of unimaginable size, a tubular freighter easily
          ten times larger then any aircraft carrier. At first glance
          it appears lifeless and adrift, but slowly the small glow of
          cockpit windows come into view as we move closer.
          Moonlight cuts across the hull, displaying the name; EDEN.

<b>          BOWER (V.0.)
</b>          Where were you... when Eden was lost?
          Like every other kid on my block, I was
          in the middle of a dream, envious of
          those who were chosen to be part of
          mankind's greatest quest. Dreaming of
          the unknown and trying to imagine what
          only the lucky few would encounter.
           We PUSH IN towards the cockpit windows and...

<b>                          DISSOLVE THRU:
</b>
<b>          INT. COCKPIT (EDEN) - CONT.
</b>
          Inside the flight deck it's ghostly vacant, rows of empty
          flight chairs and numerous guidance computers gently
          blinking. With half filled coffee-cups and jackets hung over
          the seat backs... it appears the control deck has been
          suddenly evacuated.
          Muffled SCREAMS are heard somewhere deeper inside the ship.

<b>          BOWER.(V.0.)
</b>          As the entire world watched in wonder,
          there were only a few, skeptical of the
          journey's success.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          Only a few... who would be right.
          The further we move into the ship... signs of violence
          appear, smears of dark blood sharply standing out on the
          bright white paneling and several broken computer screens.
          The muffled SCREAMS grow louder and clearer... an argument
          between men, panicked rage over-lapping.

<b>                         (CONTINUED)
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          2.
</b>
<b>                         CONTINUED:
</b>          CAMERA slowly moves past a corner to see the middle-of a
          violent confrontation. One OFFICER is locked inside a sleep
          chamber, banging on the glass and pleading with panic.
          Another OFFICER is on the floor, mortally wounded, his body
          still twitching with his head bashed in. The INSANE OFFICER,
          a young corporal is moving from terminal to terminal, typing
          in commands with a casual and emotionless nature.
          Blood streams have run down his face from both ears and nose
          as he continues to type commands into the flight computer...
          heightening the trapped OFFICER'S muffled,. screams.

<b>                         TRAPPED OFFICER
</b>
<b>                         (IN FRENCH)
</b>
<b>          STOP IT! STOP FOR GOD'S SAKES! PLEASE!
</b>
<b>          GOD NO!
</b>          The INSANE OFFICER hits the final command key and warning
          buzzers ignite with flashing lights. He closes his eyes,
          taking a breath of relief.

<b>                         TRAPPED OFFCIER
</b>
<b>                         (IN FRENCH)
</b>
<b>          STOP IT! YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS WILL
</b>
<b>          DO TO- YOU'RE NOT- STOP! YOU'RE GOING
</b>
<b>          TO FUCKING KILL US ALL!
</b>          The trapped OFFICER begins pounding on the glass with a
          crazed panic as the INSANE OFFICER calmly goes to his own
          sleep-pod and climbs inside, sealing the hatch.

<b>          TRAPPED OFFCIER (CONT-D)
</b>
<b>                         (IN FRENCH)
</b>
<b>          PLEASE GOD! NO! NO GOD DAMMIT!
</b>          Control panels flash and hydraulics ignite. Like a row of
          tumbling dominos, each of the sleep-chamber pods shift
          positions with a SHUSH of hydraulics and then... they are
          launched with a ROAR of micro-jets.

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          EXT. SHIP "EDEN" - CONT.
</b>
          We're suddenly back into the unsettling silence as... like a
          bee hive that's exploded, thousands of coffin-sized sleep
          pods are ejected from the ship in unison. They are sent
          tumbling into open space in every direction as the ship
          slowly continues its unaffected course.

<b>                         (CONTINUED)
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          3.
</b>
<b>                         CONTINUED:
</b>          The trapped OFFICER is seen SCREAMING in silence inside his
          own pod.

<b>                         DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>          EXT. OUTER SPACE
</b>
          We slowly float towards an astroid field. As we grow closer
          it's the sea of sleep pods slowly floating through space.

<b>          BOWER (P.O.)
</b>          Where was I... when I heard we'd lost
          Eden? Just like every other kid on my
          block... I was dreaming... of being one
          who would be chosen to follow.
          As we move closer to the asteroid field of sleep pods, it's
          obvious that time has passed, a single skeleton inside each
          of the pods, hands in a clawing position towards the glass.
          We PUSH IN towards one pod, moving towards the SKULL, still
          locked in a SCREAMING position, wide mouthed and...

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          M. HYPER-SLEEP CHAMBER
</b>          A RUMBLE passes... EYELIDS TWITCH... A GASP.
          Inside a coffin-size chamber, a dim glow of light seeps
          through a small glass porthole. A MAN is asleep, a mask
          attached to his face, tubes of liquid feeding into his arms.
          CORPORAL BOWER, military physique, chiseled features. His
          chest lightly expanding, blood pulsating through his veins.
          Lights FLICKER PAST and his body comes to life, muscles
          flinching, breath quickening. He squirms with discomfort,
          ripping away the mask. He gasps, trying to SCREAM.

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT - CONT.
</b>
          His scream is muffled under three inches of glass. The hatch
          door is hit with a THUD and white gases erupt from the edges.
          THUD, THUD... THUD! The door bursts open and BOWER scampers
          out, struggling to rip away the feeding tubes. He HITS the
          floor, naked and gasping. His pores ignite, dripping sweat.
          He tries to get to his feet, but his legs wobble underneath
          him, collapsing. He yells at the floor.

<b>                         (CONTINUED)
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          4.

<b>                         CONTINUED:
</b>
<b>                         BOWER
</b>          Burns are red! Bruises... blue-
          His voice echoes into the dark, alone in a cavernous room as
          he pauses, struggling for orientation. He gets to his feet,
          muscles twitching. His short-cropped hair is... pure white.

<b>                         BOWER (CONT'D)
</b>          Hey...? HEY!!? Someone?
          A constant low RUMBLE is present, joined by the occasional
          MOAN and CREAK of a large ship. A SHUDDER travels through
          the room with a random FLICKER of LIGHTS to reveal...
          A massive steel compartment, tangled with technology. It's
          cold and institutional. High-tech computer terminals slope
          out of the floor. The FLICKER passes, taking us into black.
          We hear him: fumbling through the room, switches are thrown
          with no result and compartments are pulled opened and...
          SNAP! A glow stick comes to life.
          He squints at his darkened surroundings with confusion. A
          drip of liquid catches his eye and he staggers back to his
          sleep pod. He grabs the dangling tubes that were ripped from
          his arm and he sucks on the tube, pulling as much liquid into
          his mouth as possible.
          After a few heavy gulps, he suddenly heaves towards the
          floor. He painfully forces himself to drink, gasping.
          He looks up to notice two sleep chambers next to his own. He
          leans closer with the glow stick to see the first one, the
          name plate reading; 2nd Lt. Cooper. It's EMPTY.
          The third pod's name plate reads; LT. PAYTON. Deep inside
          there is the figure of a man, asleep under a mask.

<b>                         BOWER (CONT'D)
</b>          Payton? Lieutenant... Payton?
          He turns back to his own pod, seeing the name plate that
          reads; CORPORAL BOWER. Even this name doesn't seem familiar.

<b>                         BOWER (CONT'D)
</b>          Bower? Bower...?
          The loss of memory heightens his fear even more as a shiver
          travels through his body while he staggers towards a nearby
          computer terminal. He taps the keys on a computer terminal.
          Nothing. He frowns, leaning closer.

</b>          As he taps the keyboard, powder blooms out from under his

          layer of dust. Under the smear is...

          He pulls focus to see... his FINGERS are trembling
          uncontrollably, an odd vibration of nerves. He slowly makes
          a fist with concern.

          BOWER walks along a row of storage lockers reading each name
          plate. He stops at the locker labelled; Corp. Bower. He
          pauses, mumbling the name once again with no recognition.

          He opens the locker to see an assortment of personalized
          belongings, uniform and gear, none of it seeming familiar.
          He uses a towel to wipe off the layer of sweat and oily
          substance coating his body, pausing to see an identification
          tattoo on his forearm that reads: FLT&gt;&gt;005Â»015.
          He pulls on a black flight suit, emblems and military
          markings of rank on the chest. He pulls on shoes and a tool
          belt with a high powered pen-lamp.
          On the inside of the locker is a emergency manual card with
          block figures displaying breathing and stretching exercises,
          labelled; Hyper-Sleep Disorientation Recovery Procedures.

          THUMPS fade as the ship eerily MOANS and CREAKS.

          up and out then stuck in the trunk.
          The room is blocked by the two heavy steel doors on either
          end, security doors ten feet wide. PAYTON leads the way
          towards one end, gesturing towards the doors.

          how we could ever get this thing open.
          As they approach, their flashlight beams pan across the door
          to see jagged chips and scratches all along the edges. Tools
          are scattered on the floor, the control panel ripped open.

          A RUMBLE approaches... another SHUDDER that FLICKERS the
          lights. They watch the ceiling as BOWER counts in his head

          He continues his search across the radio channels, keeping

          SHUSH... THUD! BOWER forces open a single paneled hatch door
          and cautiously enters into an institutional style mess hall.
          Hundreds of lunch tables and chairs. Random SPARKS of light
          erupt from neon lights overhead.

          gradually become more dishevelled, chairs knocked over and
          unknown liquid dripping from the tables. Garbage litters the
          floor, a dim glow of light emerging from the galley.
          He crawls along the edge of the counter and peeks inside the
          galley, horribly ran-sacked. In the midst of the wreckage, a
          darkened FIGURE is seen scavenging through the cupboards,
          angrily tossing empty containers aside.
          The FIGURE pauses, sensing a presence and glances back as...
          BOWER ducks. He contemplates, pulling out the envelope
          opener and slowly peeks back out and...
          POW! He's HIT in the face, blood spraying, slamming onto his
          back. The pen-lamp and envelope opener spin across the
          floor. BOWER tries to get up and he's grabbed by the hair, a
          blade pressed against his neck.

          She quickly pats him down, stealing tools. All he can see is
          her bare feet, blackened from oil. He frowns to see her toe-
          nails painted with bright pink polish.
          NADIA, a torn jump suit, snarled hair hiding her face, skin
          smeared with oil. A beautiful woman underneath an

          BOWER lunges and they go into a violent spin, crashing over a

          the fight through the flicker of light.
          CRACK! BOWER'S hit, sent flying and he looks up to see her
          silhouette approaching, edged weapon in her hand.

          attack abruptly halts, slowly back pedalling with fright.
          BOWER is confused, realizing her eyes are looking past him.
          A BLUISH GLOW seeps in from the doorway, approaching from the
          corridor. He looks back to see NADIA is running for the
          kitchen... gone.

          carrying a long steel spear-like device with a splinter of
          blinding BLUE FIRE on the tip, fueled with a chemical sprayer
          like a welder's torch.
          His obstructed view reveals the FIGURE as a tribal warrior,
          scantily clad, elongated muscular frames, pale skin coated in
          hydraulic fluid. Bald head with clumps of tangled hair. It
          moves smoothly and silently, jabbing the tip of the flaming
          device into each corner and crevasse, as if flushing out
          anything hidden.

          What the hell is-
          The FIGURE quickly spins his direction and SNAPS a lever on
          the spear-device, killing the blue flame and taking us
          instantly into darkness.
          BOWER holds his breath with fright, back pedalling on his
          knees as his eyes try to adjust to the dark. He takes an
          uneasy breath to realize... there is more then one.
          Slowly moving out of the shadows, four more HUNTERS slowly
          emerge, like a unified pack on the prowl. They carry an
          assortment of crudely made weapons, spears and blades of
          sharpened metal.
          The apparent leader of the pack is HEFLIN, the largest and
          strongest of the group and he directs the pack with an
          assortment of odd vocal sounds, deep HISSES from the throat
          and gargled CACKLES.
          On command, the one HUNTER flips a lever and the BLUE FLAME
          crackles back to life with a burst of flammable liquid. The
          hunt continues, the pack weaving through the debris,
          following NADIA'S path.
          As the BLUISH GLOW fades, BOWER is left bewildered and
          terrified. Suddenly, his radio sounds...

          WEASEL'S face, oddly contorted in the rounded reflection.
          WEASEL is headed directly for BOWER until.., a HISS from
          HEFLIN calls him back. WEASEL takes one last look before
          turning back, the torch fades from view, taking us into

          Climbing up the angled furnishings, he searches for any
          available weapon. He notices a mantel that displays several
          antique astrological and navigation devices. He spots an
          antique pistol. He breaks the glass, grabbing the gun, but
          it crumbles under his grip, falling to pieces.
          He sighs, but pauses to see... because the furniture is
          angled, his light spots a hiding spot underneath the desk.
          He pulls out a silver flask, bone dry. He reaches further,
          pulling out an unusually shaped weapon, much like a sawed-off
          shotgun with rounded edges. He snaps open the hand-crank
          I lever and gives a forceful whirl. A slow MOAN of magnetos
          causes the weapon's lights to dimly come to life.

          weaves through a compartment filled with filtration units and
          a maze of piping.
          BOWER spots a clear path but BUMPS into glass. He realizes
          the compartment is separated by thick glass dividers. He
          changes directions and sees SHEPARD crawling through a vent.
          He tries to follow as... a BLUE TORCH moves past the doorway,
          bare feet running across steel. A collection of HISS and
          CACKLES grow louder.
          BOWER crawls under piping to hide. He notices the activation
          lights on his weapon fading... and he quietly tries to give
          the energy lever a few turns... but the WHINE seems too loud.

          is released from the rig and SHEPARD bursts into a wild
          frenzy, trying to run while on a thirty foot long leash. The

          -The weapon is designed to destroy biological and organic
          material, but for safety precautions, it's unable to
          penetrate man-made materials like lead, glass or steel. It's
          unable to puncture the ship's hull.
          The energy blast is an electrical discharge that CRACKS like
          lightening and echoes like thunder. The blast HITS the side
          of the wall with a deafening RIPPLE of aftershocks,
          shattering anything fragile and knocking over anything not
          fastened down within a thirty foot radius. This little thing
          packs a punch.
          The HUNTERS turn towards BOWER, the lead hunter turning to
          reveal itself as...

          glistening with a layer of hydraulic fluid along with tribal
          I scars and distorted war paint. His eyes hidden under shadow.
          He slowly lifts his shoulders while lowering his head, much
          like the fluid motions of a reptilian predator.
          BOWER frantically cranks the energy lever and raises it
          toward HEFLIN, completely unaffected by the threat. He
          squeezes the trigger and...
          KA-WHAP! The gunshot is THUNDEROUS, HITTING the unseen glass
          divider between them. The safety glass absorbs the blast,
          sending a SHUDDER through the hull.
          HEFLIN barely flinches, stepping closer with a HISS. Off his
          command, the HUNTERS take chase, swarming in every direction,
          searching for a route around the glass divider.

          TANAKA hands him a flashlight. BOWER does his best charades,

          from inside the ventilation shaft.
          PAYTON contemplates, eyes panicked. He climbs up the wall
          and wedges the panel cover over the shaft opening, jamming it
          closed with a screwdriver. He backs away, gripping the

          A pin-point of light appears at the end of a circular tunnel.
          Slowly the light grows as BOWER approaches and cautiously
          steps through a doorway and into...
          A rec room with several rows of pool tables, video games and
          a ran-sacked bar. The floor is heavily littered with broken
          glass and BOWER wipes his finger across a wet surface on the

          TANAKA has come to his rescue, twirling a pipe across his
          palms. The ATTACKER rolls to her feet to reveal... NADIA.
          She snatches a pool ball off the table and throws it directly
          into TANAKA'S chest.

          HITS the bar, SHATTERING every piece of glass that's near by

          BOWER'S focus completely shifts, turning towards the pods,

          SHADOW passes with a CACKLING HISS. They freeze, laying on
          top of the remains, the bones CRINKLING underneath them.
          The HISS grows stronger... and they look up to see a
          silhouetted HUNTER crouched over like a gargoyle on a rafter,
          leering in their direction.

          slide. The HISS grows stronger.

          send him flying, CRASHING into a pile of bones.
          NADIA spins around with a bladed pipe in her hands... but the
          HUNTER is already gone. She spins back and... THWAP! She's
          HIT from behind and sent with break-neck force into the

          The HUNTER stumbles, staggers and... HIIIISSSSSST! It HITS
          TANAKA, sending him airborne, nearly knocking him out.
          Under the FLICKERING LIGHT, BOWER, NADIA and TANAKA all

          follows suite, jumping inside another chamber and BOWER
          scrambles, in search of an open door as footsteps are heard

          massive corridor and a BLINKING LIGHT is activated on a
          nearby sleep-chamber. And then...

          shadows from every direction, bladed weapons spinning.
          BOWER pulls away from NADIA'S grip and prepares to intervene,
          but TANAKA suddenly grabs him, holding him back with force.
          With the BIG PASSENGER wounded and moaning on the floor, the
          HUNTERS gather in a circle in ceremonial fashion, praying
          thanks for the feast the ship has presented.
          They watch helplessly as the BIG PASSENGER is then brutally
          attacked and eaten alive. WEASEL leads other HUNTERS under
          the flickering light in a demented and twisted celebratory
          dance, a frenzy of pure evil.
          This attack is heard more then it is seen, under flickering
          lights, obscured view and most of the camera angles on Bower

          Frozen in horror, BOWER is tugged by TANAKA, following NADIA
          to the corner where she's lifted a grate in the floor. They

          weapon, tucking it away and cautiously approached GALLO for a
          closer inspection.

          PAYTON goes to a nearby compartment, popping open a First-Aid
          case; inside is a pistol-gripped syringe. He turns back and

          A FLICKER of LIGHT passes to reveal... BOWER crouched inside
          a three-foot high, narrow passageway, a crawl space beneath a
          steel grated floor. He follows the tunnel into a large silo
          lined with octagonal filters.
          TANAKA and NADIA are both looking for a way out, jabbing
          pipes into the grate overhead, unable to budge it.

          They climb down the shaft, jumping from filter to filter. At
          one level they follow the sound into a shaft opening and
          towards the soft, warm GLOW of YELLOW LIGHT.
          They reach an open hatch, peering inside to see...
          Inside an empty storage tank, a comfortable living space has
          been created; numerous chairs surround a make-shift dinner
          table made from storage crates with hand-made candles and
          various food containers. The tank appears empty.

<b>                         BOWER (CONT'D)

          BOWER and TANAKA begin to climb through and NADIA hesitates
          with uncertainty. They crawl through the hatch...

          They climb into the empty tank, lined with valves and
          filtration screens. The music is playing from crackling
          speakers hidden in the darkened circular catwalk overhead.
          TANAKA goes straight for the food and as soon as NADIA steps
          through the hatch... a wire SNAPS! Levers clank and a mouse-
          trap has triggered... SLAMMING the hatch closed. Trapped!
          They instantly turn back to the door, yanking and tugging in
          a panic. BOWER pans his light towards the catwalk only to
          see a FIGURE (LELAND) scampering through the shadows.
          Another lever is turned and... F00000SH! A stream of vapor
          shoots out of several vents along the wall. The colorless
          gas hits them and they instantly gag, choking for air.
          With the slanted walls of the tank, there seems to be no
          escape, but TANAKA runs up the wall, diving and grabbing onto
          a pipe, climbing upward toward the catwalk.
          The shadowed FIGURE (LELAND) quickly hobbles to the railing.

          BOWER whirls the magneto lever on the weapon and he raises
          the barrel towards the hatch, nearly point blank.
          KA-CRAAAACK! The energy blast from the weapon hits the hatch
          like a lightening bolt sending a tremendous JOLT through the
          entire tank. A spark IGNITES the chemical gas and there's a
          BURST of flammable gas that rolls upward into the catwalks.
          LELAND is knocked off his feet and he GASPS with shock.

          LELAND is exposed from his hiding place, waving the smoke
          from his face, bewildered. He's an older man who's lost all
          vanity over survival. A thin-framed, spidery little man with

          A small propane flame is lit. LELAND hovers over a make-
          shift stove, heating a can of water. He pours in some powder
          and stirs it up with the meticulous nature of a chef

          using water to clean a wound and BOWER is peering through a
          slit in a vent.

          BOWER and NADIR exchange a look of uncertainty. The
          classical music begins to SKIP and without even looking
          LELAND kicks a piece of equipment, correcting the music.

</b>          Refused to go to bed, stayed up to play
          in his room. Oh, and what naughty little
          games he would play with the slumbering
          prey. Slayer, master, both God and the
          Devil, some would say. The boy would grow
          to manhood, a self-proclaimed King, ruler
          of his vessel, home to his own sin.

          barren cargo holds to fend for
          themselves... scavenging against the
          others within their own domain.

          it with a frown, running back from the door.

          No response. GALLO'S shadow moves behind him, his voice
          taking on a slight raspier and "older" tone.

          PAYTON refuses to acknowledge him, continuing to monitor the

          pipe weapon as he senses GALLO'S presence behind him.

          GALLO steps closer behind him, his shadowed outline showing
          an imposing posture, his voice is forced and unsteady.

          and hits the primer switch. A split-second of nothing and

          reads: &gt;&gt; ROTATION SEQUENCE &gt;&gt; CODE INITIATE TO PROCEED &gt;&gt;

          entire floor of HUNTERS are awake, heads turned towards them.
          HEFLIN steps closer in their direction with a HISS.
          BOWER gasps and the entire pack of HUNTERS moves toward them
          and... suddenly, TANAKA bangs his bladed weapon against the
          railing with a heavy CLANK! The HUNTERS instantly turn
          toward his direction and TANAKA throws his weapon, HITTING
          one of the HUNTERS directly in the head.
          TANAKA jumps to the neighboring catwalk and breaks through a

          directly for the open hatchway. (The hatchway they detoured
          earlier.) He dives through as the sprinting HUNTER is almost
          upon him.

          The control panel on a sleep-chamber is FLASHING as a
          passenger KICKS his hatch open from the inside. The haggard
          and bewildered passenger crawls out to find himself in the
          middle of CHAOS. Before he can get a breath he's attacked by

          streams are running from his nose and ears.
          Y77e will now refer to PAYTON by his real name, GALLO.
          LELAND and GALLO exchange a look... GALLO seeming to snap out
          of his trance. LELAND approaches, wheezing for air.

          as LELAND tries to cry out, his voice gargled with blood as
          he staggers, collapsing to the floor. GALLO hits a key and
          LIGHTS IGNITE, the last door finally engaging.
          GALLO sigh with relief as the doors slide open revealing a
          corridor of stairs leading to the bridge. A warm and gentle
          smile widens on his face.

          towards the sliding doors. HUNTERS lunge out of side
          corridors with SCREECHING HISSES as BOWER and NADIA dive
          through the sliding doors...
          One HUNTER is crushed by the doors., split nearly in half with
          a heavy THUD of steel and a MOAN of hydraulics. The HUNTER
          spasms wildly, kicking and clawing as BOWER and NADIA back
          pedal into the room. HUNTERS gather at the gap, stabbing
          weapons between the doors, trying to crawl through with
          SCREECHES and HISSES of rage.

          The original room that BOWER woke up in now looks quite
          different with all the systems engaged, BLINDING LIGHT coming
          from the monitors and computer terminals.
          They move through the room, passing the empty sleep chambers
          and the control console, seeing the entire pathway of dripped
          blood across the floor.

          She frowns off his look and turns to see... LELAND on the
          floor in a pool of blood, throat slashed, dead.
          BOWER pulls the gun and heads into the open doorway leading
          towards the bridge as NADIA follows behind.

          A tunneled stairwell widens out into the main flight bridge.
          A stunning sight, a split-level glass control deck, rows of
          blinking control panels and flight chairs. It appears
          undisturbed, a thin layer of silt floats out from under their
          footsteps.
          BOWER leads the way, panning the weapon throughout the room
          with no sign of GALLO. On the far wall; cockpit windows
          coated with a black fungus that obscures the view, but hints
          to the illusion of outer space, a haze of cosmic dust without
          stars.

          across the screen.

          through the flight computer's time-code. Starting with the
          launch date and time the numbers begin to roll faster and

          Off her gasp, BOWER grabs his gun and approaches as the

          A slow grin spreads across GALLO'S face as he finally looks
          to him, revealing the thick streams of blood that have
          dripped from his nose, coating his chin and neck.

          BOWER keeps the gun on him as he goes to the windows. NADIA
          has a ghostly expression, unable to speak. BOWER leans
          toward the glass, squinting into the darkness and...
          SWISH! An object moves past the outside of the glass. He
          leans closer, squinting to see... a school of ALIEN FISH dart
          past. The shin is underwater.
          BOWER staggers in shock, back pedalling as GALLO continues to

          BOWER lunges towards him and GALLO is ready for this one,
          quickly countering his move and SLAMMING BOWER into the
          console. He unleashes a vicious BLOW into BOWER'S throat.
          BOWER collapses, choking for air and GALLO kicks the gun
          away. He kneels over BOWER, slowly pulling out a blade.

<b>          G_ALLO (CONT'D)

          He slides the blade under BOWER'S neck and... there's a WHIRL
          of magnetos.
          He looks up to see NADIA cranking the lever on the energy

          1 THUNDER, knocking everyone off their feet. Shattered glass
          and metal HIT the cockpit window like a spray of shrapnel...

          upward, forcing her to take a GASP as...
          BOSSSH! Water explodes through the windows, hitting the room
          like a hundred fire hoses. GALLO is hit directly and thrown
          across the room as NADIA and BOWER are engulfed by the blast
          of black water, sent tumbling.

          The tremendous ROAR of rushing water rolls them down the
          stairwell and into the sleep chamber compartment in a raging
          torrent, a tidal wave slams into the wall.
          BOWER grabs onto NADIA and they claw themselves along the
          wall as computer terminals SPARK and LIGHTS go black. He
          pulls her to a sleep-chamber and he jumps inside the open
          hatch, pulling her with.

          BOWER struggles to close the hatch as water rushes in,
          SLAMMING it shut on top of them.
          GALLO struggles to keep his head above water as the fast
          moving current SLAMS him into the edge of the doorway. His
          I fingers claw at the manual lever for the door, tugging and
          tugging with no effect as the water rises above his head.

          a tunnel until they're HIT with a tremendous JOLT.
          They are sent spinning into a wild tumble as bubbles and gas
          erupt across the outer surface. BOWER and NADIA slam into
          one another as the chamber turns end over end.
          Its roll seems to slow for a brief moment and BOWER squints

          exterior hull of the massive space ship slides past at a high
          rate of speed with a swirl of ocean water and bubbles.
          BAM! The pod SLAMS into something as SPARKS fly and seals
          are ruptured as WATER sprays in with a blinding BLAST. The
          chamber is sent into another violent roll as NADIA and BOWER
          tumble head over feet, as if caught within a washing machine.
          The chamber finally steadies as water washes across the
          control panel, one last burst of sparks knocks out the
          lights, taking them into BLACK.
          Only their gasps are heard as they squirm towards the upper
          corner... only a foot of air remaining.
          He grabs the mask connected to tubes in the side and pulls
          the straps over her head.

          NADIA gasps the air through the mask, making her eye-lids
          droop, slowly going unconscious. BOWER gasps one last breath
          and the water rises over his head.
          BOWER watches her body go limp and squirms for air as... a
          warm GLOW of WHITE LIGHT grows brighter through the porthole.

          across the surface of an ocean.
          He pulls NADIA out of the chamber, ripping the mask off her
          face. Her eye-lids slowly begin to flicker back to

          within the ocean waves. They're just off shore from a
          stretch of mountainous tropical islands with waves crashing
          against the beaches. The unusual shape of the islands and
          their geography are nothing like we've ever seen on Earth.

          dishevelled command platform, the walls dripping with water.
          The water is being drained through the grates in the floor as

          sleep chamber once sat. He eyes the other sleep-chambers,
          deeply contemplating.
          He goes back to the control console, scanning across the
          numerous surveillance monitors that reveal...
          PASSENGERS and HUNTERS engaged in a variety of activities all
          across the ship. Some are seen fighting, some searching for
          food, some searching for a way out, some alone weeping. A
          kingdom, for the taking.
          He pulls out a coffee packet and slowly begins mixing himself
          a cup, deeply contemplating as he looks across the screens.
          He glances over to see... YOUNG GALLO, the younger version of
          himself, who is seated nearby, watching with a grin. The
          blood is gone from his face, appearing clean-cut, clean
