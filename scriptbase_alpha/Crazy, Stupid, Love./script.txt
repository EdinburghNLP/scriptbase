          FADE IN:
                         
          1 INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT (PASADENA, CA) - EVENING 1 
                         
           Soft music. A classy joint. Below the tables, WE PAN
           well-heeled feet nuzzling. Finally we SETTLE ON: 
                         
                         
           A PAIR OF FEET
                         
           WHITE SNEAKERS sitting opposite FANCY HIGH HEELS. These
           feet aren't nuzzling. There's distance here.
                         
           PULL UP, REVEALING CAL WEAVER (42) and his wife, TRACY 
           (41). A handsome couple. He'd be JFK to her Jackie O... 
           if he gave a shit. Unfortunately, he doesn't (i.e.:
           white sneakers in fancy French restaurant).
                         
           Cal pulls out READING GLASSES, looks at the menu.
                         
                          CAL
           Well, I'm full. You were right,
           hon. I shouldn't have eaten all
           that bread.
                          (THEN)
           Want to just share a dessert?
                         
           Tracy is lost in thought, gazing at a menu.
                         
                          CAL
           You okay, babe? You seem out of
           it.
                         
                          TRACY
           Yeah, I'm just thinking about what
           I want.
                         
                          CAL
           Me too. Okay, let's say it at the
           same time. One. Two. Three...
                          TRACY CAL
           I want a divorce. Creme Brulee.

          2 INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE (PASADENA) - SAME EVENING 2 
                         
           JESSICA (17) chases after MOLLY (9). Jessica's skinny,
           wears glasses, a hipster T-shirt. In five years, she's
           going to make all the boys' heads spin. But not yet.

           getcha!
                         
           She grabs Molly and tickles her. Molly SQUEALS with 
           delight. As she kicks... SMASH! A picture falls off the
           nearby console. Jessica picks it up: 
                         
                         
           ON SMASHED PHOTO
                         
           Cal and Tracy. This is their house.
                         
                         
           BACK TO SCENE
                          
                          JESSICA
           It's okay, my fault.
                          (THEN)
           Alright, kiddo, it's getting late,
           let's get you to bed before your
           parents get home. Don't give me
           the puppy eyes, you little maniac.
           Go brush your teeth!
                         
           Molly GIGGLES, RUNS upstairs. Once Molly's gone, Jessica
           looks at the photo. She eyes Cal affectionately.

           Meanwhile, TWO YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WOMEN drink and laugh
           at a table. HANNAH (24) is clearly buzzed. 
                          HANNAH
           I don't care. I love him and
           given the opportunity, I'd have
           his babies.
                         
           Her best friend, LIZ (29), LAUGHS.
                         
                          LIZ
           Seriously? Conan O'Brien? You'd
           do Conan O'Brien? 
                          
                          HANNAH
           I'm just saying, Richard's a lot 
           of things: successful, smart...

           all.
                         
                          LIZ
           Yeah, well, you want funny, go
           watch `Cosby' reruns. You want a
           good lay, go get yourself some
           of... that.
                         
           She motions off to the side.
                         
                          HANNAH
           What?
                         
                          LIZ
           The hot piece that's been checking
           you out for the last hour.
                         
           THE CROWD PARTS, revealing: JACOB PALMER (32). The 
           smoothest, coolest son-of-a-bitch you've ever seen. He
           tilts his glass at them, toasting.

           Meanwhile, Cal sits in the passenger seat, dazed. A "to-
           go" box from the French restaurant in his lap. Tracy
           drives.
                         
                          TRACY
           Aren't you going to say anything?
                         
           Nothing.
                         
                          TRACY
           Almost twenty-five years of
           marriage, you have nothing to say?
                         
           She looks at him. He turns to her, about to say
           something, then... stops himself. Turns back forward.
                         
           It's silent. Devastating.

           Meanwhile, Jessica (the baby-sitter) stops at a bedroom
           door. She hears MUSIC coming from inside, puts her ear 
           to the door. It's Lady Gaga. It's awful. 
                         
           She smiles, knocks and opens the door at the same time.

           We'll make love and it will be
           amazing. You'll laugh afterwards
           and say `I never do this kind of
           thing.' Then you'll do it again.

           kept asking the decorator how he

           It's okay.
                         
           Jessica reaches for the door, but stops. She takes a
           deep breath, adorable.

           Mr. Weaver, I know you don't know
           me very well, but I've been baby-
           sitting for your family for three
           years. You're the nicest dad of
           any of the families I baby-sit
           for, by a country mile.

           You're funny, and you're always
           really generous, and you're the
           only dad who's excited --
           genuinely excited -- to check on
           his kids when he gets home from
           dinner. Now I like Mrs. Weaver, I
           like her a lot, but if she wants
           to divorce you, well... then I
           think she's batshit crazy.

           a rough couple of days, obviously. 
           Nothing I could use more than my 
           old pal Bernie to unload on. Hey, 
           we should play racquetball, when's 
           the last time we played 
           racquetball? 
                         
                          BERNIE 
           Claire won't let me be friends 
           with you anymore. 
                         
           Cal takes this in. 
                         
                          CAL 
           I'm sorry, what? 
                         
                          BERNIE 
           She said we had to choose between 
           you and Tracy. I chose you. She 
           said no.

           He pulls a WRAPPED PACKAGE from the bag, hands it to Cal. 
                         
                          BERNIE 
           It's cologne.

           Are you breaking up with me? 
                         
                          BERNIE 
           Claire's waiting in the car. 
           Um... there's a gift receipt in 
           there. Sorry. 
                         
           Bernie stands, awkwardly. He pats Cal on the shoulder, 
           lingers a beat too long, then simply turns and EXITS. 
                         
           Cal is left alone. He raises a finger at the Bartender. 
                         
                          CAL 
           Do you have anything with a worm 
           in it? Because I'd like a gallon 
           of that now.

           Legs crossed, martini in hand, he's been watching Cal get 
           dumped this whole time. 
                         
           He PANS UP from Cal's feet. The white sneakers. Bad
           navy blue dress socks. Dad khakis. An ill-fitting,
           untucked, dress shirt. Half-lidded eyes. Rumpled hair.
                         
           Jacob shakes his head. Jesus Christ. He says something 
           to THE WOMAN who currently sits at the table. She nods, 
           gets up and walks away. 
                         
                         
           BACK TO CAL
                         
           As the Bartender pours him a second shot. He's now 
           showing pictures from his wallet to the Bartender.

           This is my youngest, Molly. Her
           two favorite things are High
           School Musical and her mother. I
           hate both of her two favorite
           things.
                         
           A SHARP WHISTLE interrupts. Cal turns, sees Jacob.
                         
           Jacob motions for Cal to come over. Every move Jacob
           makes is practiced, perfectly cool.

           David Jacobowitz, yes, Cal, I've
           heard. We've all heard. For the
           last two nights, I've watched you 
           batter every poor soul in this bar
           with your sad-sack loser sob
           story.

           Cal, I'm going to make you an
           offer, it's probably the best
           offer you're ever going to get,
           and you're extremely drunk, so
           it's wildly important that you
           don't answer until I've finished
           and you've taken a few moments to
           process what I'm saying. Do you
           understand?
                         
           Cal goes to answer, Jacob holds up a finger. Cal stops
           himself. Once he's settled, Jacob continues:
                         
                          JACOB
           As I said, I've been watching you
           for two days now and I can say, 
           without hesitation, that you are
           the sorriest man I've ever seen in
           my life -- don't interrupt, Cal,
           it's the truth, and you need to
           hear it. You're sitting there
           with your Supercut haircut,
           getting drunk on watered down
           vodka-cranberries like a fourteen-
           year-old girl, wearing a 41R
           jacket when you should be wearing
           a 40L -- I don't know if I want to
           help you or euthanize you
           -- stop drinking out of the
           goddamn straw, Cal. 
                         
           Cal stops drinking from the wimpy red straw. 
                         
                          JACOB
           You asked me for advice before, 
           Cal, so I'm going to help you. I 
           don't know why. Maybe I'm just
           bored. Maybe all my friends have
           abandoned me for wives and
           children and labradoodle puppies,
           who cares why? Why doesn't
           matter. The point is, you've got
           a good face, and a good head of
           hair, and I'm bored as hell and
           need a project. So if you want,
           I'm going to help you rediscover
           your manhood. Do you remember
           when it was that you lost it? 
                         
           Cal shakes "no."

           Doesn't matter, we'll find it.
           And when we do, when I'm through
           with you, that wife of yours is
           going to rue the day she decided
           to give up on you too early.
           That's my offer. What do you say?
                         
           Cal stares at him blankly. A long beat of silence. Cal
           goes for a drink, almost uses the straw... then catches
           himself. He puts down the drink. Looks up.

           You ready to go? 
                         
           She nods, subservient, and follows him out.
                         
           Cal shakes his head, picks up his drink, and slurps the
           rest of his vodka cranberry out of the straw.

           A well-maintained yard, bordered by shrubs and bushes. A 
           long driveway runs parallel to the yard. A medium-sized 
           U-HAUL is parked in the driveway.

           A weathered playground sits off to the side. You can 
           tell it hasn't been used in quite some time. Baseball 
           equipment lays all over, the site of many father-son

           It's pretty obvious that she's been crying. Awkward 
           silence. Neither knows what to say.

           Hannah leads Liz out of the restaurant, WHISPERS:
                         
                          HANNAH
           Did you hear that? `It's going to
           be a special night.' You think
           he's going to propose?
                         
                          LIZ
           At the Cheesecake Factory? Oh
           God, I hope not.
                          (THEN)
           Why? Do you really want him to?
                         
           Hannah SHRUGS.
                         
                          HANNAH
           He's nice.
                         
                          LIZ
           Yeah, well... Jesus. Really? 
           (with a shrug)
           Okay. Not my life, I love you,
           call me if you need anything. 
                         
           Liz KISSES her goodbye, EXITS. Hannah looks at her 
           table. Everyone is typing on their BLACKBERRIES. 
                         
           She SIGHS, heads to rejoin them.

           Meanwhile, Cal sees Jacob, standing against a pole in the 
           food court. Jacob is eating pizza, cool as ever.
                         
                          JACOB
           You're late.

           We'll start with shoes. Let me
           see those sneakers you're wearing.
                         
           Cal holds up his foot.
                         
                          JACOB
           Take them off.
                         
           Cal bends down, takes one off.

           Cal does as he's told. Jacob holds out his hands. Cal
           SHRUGS, hands Jacob the shoes.
                         
           Jacob simply turns and throws them over the railing.

           Cal (barefoot) follows Jacob around the store.
                         
                          CAL
           I think this whole thing might
           have been a bad idea.
                         
           Jacob ignores him, grabs a pair of BLACK DRESS SHOES. 
                         
                          JACOB

           Jacob CHUCKLES. Cal CHUCKLES back, clearly unsure what
           the chuckle symbolizes.
                         
                          JACOB

           In Hell, every store is the Gap,

           You see that, Cal? The simple act
           of opening your mouth instantly
           causes Tiffany to lose interest in
           sleeping with you. Your
           personality is actually your
           weakest link.
                         
           Cal takes this in.

           No, Cal. The meanest thing
           anyone's ever said to you is this:
           your wife cheated on you because
           you lost sight of what it took to
           keep her content at home -- as a
           man, as a husband, and probably as
           a lover.

           He looks great, but not yet comfortable in his new

           Jacob, on the other hand, looks like he's walked out of a

           your kids. Here's the only thing 
           I need to know: how many women

           Tracy was so damn beautiful. You
           know those women, the ones who can
           be wildly sexy and unbelievably
           cute all at once? I never knew
           how she did that. I still don't
           know how she does it.

           You want to talk about The Scarlet
           Letter, Mrs. Thompson? Here you
           go: the `A' they're both wearing
           -- I think it stands for ASSHOLE.
           Wanna know why? Because they're
           in love, and love is for stupid
           ASSHOLES. So thanks for choosing
           this book, Mrs. Thompson, because
           this is what I need right now: to 
           read a boring, confusing book
           about a bunch of stupid assholes
           who fell in love, like assholes,
           and then had to die, like
           assholes. I'm sorry for cursing.

           I'm also not sorry, if I'm being 
           completely honest. 
                          (GATHERING HIMSELF) 
           I want to make sure you know how

           A lot. Just to clarify. I like 
           you a lot. I had no intention of 
           falling for a married woman. I 
           just wanted someone to go to lunch 
           with who didn't make me want to 
           shoot myself in the face. But we 
           started having lunch, and talking, 
           and suddenly I was an accountant 
           who was popping out of bed in the 
           morning, excited to get to work. 
           That doesn't happen to 
           accountants. Ever. I've checked 
           with other accountants. 
                         
           She smiles.

           So when the time is right for you 
           to get back out there again, 
           officially, I just... I'd like to 
           throw my hat in the ring. 
           Officially. That sounded weird. 
                         
           Tracy LAUGHS lightly, leans forward. 
                         
                          TRACY 
           David, you've been a great friend 
           to me. And you were the first man 
           in a very long time to make me 
           feel... noticed, I guess? What 
           happened between us that night... 
           it meant something to me. You 
           weren't the only one excited to 
           come to work lately. 
                         
           David smiles. 
                         
                          TRACY 
           But now, when I see you, all I see 
           is his face. All I see when I 
           look at you is what I did to my 
           marriage. 
                         
           She's losing it, wipes her eyes. 
                         
                          TRACY 
           You see this? I'm saving you from 
           disaster, David, `cause you're 
           asking to pre-board the Titanic. 
           Honestly, do you really want any 
           part of this? 
           Before he can answer... BUZZ! It's Tracy's phone.

           We work together.
                         
           Robbie takes him in, shakes his hand.

           I'll be right back, okay, honey?
                          ROBBIE DAVID
           Okay. Okay.
                         
           Awkward. Really awkward. Tracy starts to say something,
           thinks better of it, and EXITS.
                         
           David moves into the room, sits down opposite Robbie.

           So, Robbie... I hear you're quite
           the soccer player.
                         
                          ROBBIE
           So, David... I hear you broke up
           my parents' marriage.
                         
           He LAUGHS awkwardly, shocked.
                         
                          ROBBIE
           You are David Jacobowitz, right?

                          ROBBIE
           Here's the thing, David: in the
           end, she winds up back with my
           dad. He's better than you, in
           every category except probably 
           math. And she still loves him.

                          ROBBIE
           Now I know what you're thinking:
           `he's just in 8th grade, what does
           he know about love?' I know a lot
           more than you think, David. Just
           today, I had a meltdown, almost
           gave up on the love of my life.
           My dad's having his meltdown now, 
           but long-term? He won't stop
           fighting for my mom any more than
           I won't stop sending Jessica texts
           that make her uncomfortable. And
           you need to know that.

           stunned in the middle of her office, staring at: 
                         
           THE PHOTO OF CAL AND TRACY that Robbie has left directly
           in his line of sight.

           Bushes rustle. Once, then twice. It's Cal, sneaking 
           into the backyard. He takes a covert look inside the 
           house. All is quiet. He gets to work. 
                         
           -- He spreads FERTILIZER on the grass.

           It's the strangest goddamn thing you've ever seen. 
           Finally, he finishes.

           Content. His yard may not be his anymore, but it's back

           A LIGHT pops on.

          46 INT. BAR - THAT NIGHT 46
           Another night at the bar: Cal's in his position, Jacob
           in his. Cal sips his drink, staring aimlessly forward.
                         
           Jacob looks at Cal. Cal looks great, more comfortable in
           his new "skin" than when we left him. He's drinking a
           martini, rather than a red-strawed vodka cranberry.
                         
           A WAITRESS passes. Without speaking, Cal taps the rim of
           the glass, silently requesting a refill. It's a cool,
           practiced move... and he did it instinctively.
                         
           Jacob smiles, leans forward.

           having the kid wax the car and the 
           kid gets all bent out of shape
           because he doesn't see the point,
           but the movements were actually 
           building blocks for throwing and
           blocking punches?

           cute -- it was something I said
           about my wife that's since been
           corrupted. But I'm tired, and I'm
           at least fifteen years older than

           slim fitting but it's really just

           thing... I don't mean to be blunt

           see her tomorrow night. Of course 
           I miss her. You don't know how

           Listen, Dad. I love you. I have

           honest here: the woman told you
           she wanted a divorce and you
           jumped out of a car.

           We are. Your son is in desperate
           need of some romantic inspiration.
           So set an example for your boy. 
           Don't give up. It's complicated?

           No, no, don't be silly, it's fine.
                          
                          RICHARD
           It's definitely a possibility,
           down the road. I think I just
           need a little more time. I'm
           still figuring out how I feel
           about us, you know: long-term.
                         
                          HANNAH
           No, I know...

           Wait -- you're figuring out how
           you feel about us?
           She LAUGHS. Once. Then twice. Loudly. Everyone's now
           watching. Liz gets a good seat, excited.

           She's really laughing now.
                         
                          HANNAH
           You know what the best part is: I
           would have said yes! To YOU! And
           I didn't even want you to propose!
           Just now, I swear to God: I was
           hoping you wouldn't propose. And
           I still would have said YES!
           That's how pathetic I am!
                         
           She snags someone else's drink from the table, DOWNS IT.
           She grabs Richard's cheeks.
                         
                          HANNAH
           I will consider your job offer,
           thank you so much, Richard.
                         
           Hysterically LAUGHING, she walks away. As she passes,
           Liz sticks out her hand and they slap five.

           Meanwhile, Jacob sits alone in the bar. He checks his
           watch. No Cal.
                         
           Suddenly, he looks very alone at his usual table.
                         
           He shakes it off, stands, and approaches the table of a
           group of nearby WOMEN.

           One of them is telling a story:
                         
                          WOMAN

           What? What did she say?
                         
           The women look up.

           Standing there, in all his glory. He flashes his coolest
           smile. They melt. We've seen this before.

           She's dripping wet from the rain, looking almost wild.
                         
           She scans the room, quickly, searching for...

           She spots him, marches straight to him.
                         
           For the first time, he looks like a deer in the 
           headlights.
                         
           She grabs him. Kisses him. A long, deep, almost angry
           kiss. She pulls back.

           I'm not sure.
                         
           Music starts playing: "As Tears Go By" by the Stones.

           Jacob pours two nice glasses of SCOTCH, neat. Brings
           them (and the bottle) over towards the couch.
                         
           He pats the couch. Hannah nods, walks over, sits down.

           They CLINK. Jacob takes a sip. Hannah downs hers. She

           Off his look...
                         
                          HANNAH
           They are, aren't they!? I always
           wondered who actually buys them!
           You do! The hot guy from the bar
           buys them! Of course!
                         
           She shakes her head, amazed. Gathers herself.
                         
                          HANNAH
           Sorry, let's proceed.
                         
           Jacob smiles, goes to kiss her... she pulls back again.
                         
                          HANNAH
           You don't have one of those

           She STARTS LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY. It's infectious.
                         
                          HANNAH
           How much did it cost?
                         
                          JACOB
           Five thousand doll-- 
                         
           That DOUBLES HER OVER, hysterical. Jacob starts laughing
           with her... really laughing. We can tell: this is
           different for him. He likes her.
                         
           We watch him as he realizes that. As he processes it.
           We watch him look at Hannah.

           Hair in her face: drunk, laughing, completely amazing.
           And then... Jacob does the most unexpected thing:
                         
                          JACOB
           Do me a favor. Ask me a question
           about myself.
                         
                          HANNAH
           What? No! I don't want to know
           anything about you.
                         
                          JACOB
           C'mon, one question.
                          
                          HANNAH
           Okay, fine, but then we bang.
                         
                          JACOB
           Absolutely. Now, come on, I'll
           answer anything. You can ask me
           about my job, or past
                          GIRLFRIENDS --

           The question takes him by surprise. He hesitates, then:
                         
                          JACOB
           Icy... I guess? Not cruel, but
           cold. Very cold.

           have...

           Stuff like this.
                         
           She motions at his abs.

           He LAUGHS.

           We PULL BACK as they continue chatting.
                         
           TIME PASSES, as one question leads to another, and then
           another.
                         
           Body language shifts.
                         
           -- Soon they're sitting in bed, sharing the Scotch from
           the bottle, just talking. Then kissing. Then lying on
           their sides, face-to-face, talking some more.
                         
           -- Until finally: it's Jacob who passes out. And it's
                         
           Hannah who covers him with a blanket, and kisses him on
           the forehead, and begins falling in love with him.

           Hannah looks longingly at Jacob's plate of pancakes. 
                         
           He notices, switches plates. 
                         
           She smiles. He smiles. God, he's crazy about her. 
                         
           He looks at the next table, watches a LOVELORN GUY switch 
           plates with his GIRLFRIEND.

           In a series of COMEDIC JUMP-CUTS, he wrestles with the 
           implications of what's happening to him. 
                         
           -- Pacing. A drink. A big drink. Fingers pulling at 
           his own hair. Hyperventilating. More staring. More 
           pacing.

           Gives in to falling in love with her.

           David, stop. Look, I had a nice 
           time, which is a substantial 
           upgrade from the rest of the... 
           times I've been having lately. 
           So, I don't think I'm ready to 
           start dating but my ex clearly is 
           and there's a yogurt shop where 
           they make this eight calorie ice 
           cream that tastes like a laxative, 
           so if you'd like to take me there 
           sometime I guess I wouldn't say 
           no.

           always want to stay awake so they 
           can see their dad when he gets

           everything they have to keep their 
           eyes open so they can hear what 
           Dad had for dinner, or how he 
           liked the movie. Lot of kids want 
           to stay awake for Mom -- and your 
           kids always want to see you, don't 
           get me wrong -- but not a lot wait 
           up for Dad. Maybe it's because 
           he's good, and he's kind, and he's 
           decent.

          75 INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION 75 
                         
           Tracy locks the door and leans against it... processing 
           what Jessica just said about Cal. 
                         
           She puts the FLOWERS down on the table, and heads into 
           the kitchen.

           CUE MUSIC. Robbie rides his bike down the street. He's 
           got Tracy's FLOWERS nestled in his handlebars.

           Jessica ENTERS in a huff, goes right toward a drawer in 
           her dresser. She pulls out a CAMERA. 
                         
                         
           IN QUICK CUTS 
                         
           we watch as she: Sets it on her dresser. Hits the 
           timer. Steps back. Drops her clothes to the floor.

           Prints a PHOTO from her camera. And places it in an

           "Cal Weaver." With a heart. She stares at the envelope 
           for a beat. 
                         
           Just then: HER DOORBELL RINGS. 
                         
           Jessica jumps, started. She quickly puts the envelope in 
           a drawer and heads for the door.

           She opens the front door. Sitting on her stoop: 
                         
           The same flowers that David Jacobowitz gave Tracy sit out 
           front. She looks at the note. It reads: "Just give me 
           a chance, love David J" but the "David J." has been 
           crossed out and replaced with "Robbie." 
                         
           She shakes her head, takes the flowers, closes the door.

           MUSIC CONTINUES as we spy the Weaver family through their 
           windows: Robbie plays video games in his room. Molly 
           watching her show in hers. Tracy in the kitchen. 
                         
           We MOVE DOWN the house, and OUTSIDE, where we discover: 
                         
           Cal in stealth mode, tending to his backyard. He 
           fertilizes, trims and waters. All under cover of night. 
                         
           TRACY (O.S.) 
           Kids! Ice cream! 
                         
           Cal looks into the living room. Tracy has brought out 
           ice cream: a carton with three spoons. The kids race 
           down the stairs, join her, and start eating. Laughing. 
                         
           We take in the real-time TABLEAU: 
                         
           Cal's wife and children -- his family -- inside. Cal: 
           watching them from the outside, looking in. 
                         
           It's touching. It's complicated. It's horribly painful. 
                         
           INSIDE... Tracy looks at her kids, thinks of something. 
           She steps into the KITCHEN, closes the door, and DIALS 
           her phone. Cal leans toward the window, suspicious. 
                         
           OUTSIDE... Cal's phone rings. He jumps to silence it.

           Hi, Cal. 
                         
           Silence. Cal is looking at her inside. She has no idea. 
                         
                          TRACY 
           So... I'm in the basement. I'm 
           trying to get the water heater 
           working `cause the pilot's out and 
           I don't know how to relight it. 
                         
           Obviously Cal sees she's not in the basement.

           I'm sorry. I know I've been out

           gotten a bit... I met a woman.

           No, I mean, I've been spending a
           lot of time with her. This woman.
           One woman.

                          JACOB
           Actually, tonight... I'm going to 
           meet her mother.

           realize you might actually have to
           answer a question or two about
           yourself?

           Hannah comes out of the wine store, hops over the car.
           Jacob can't help but smile: wow, he's REALLY into her.
                         
                          JACOB
           Gotta go. Grab a beer next week?

           Thanks. 
                         
           Cal HANGS up, LAUGHS to himself, and gets back to work. 
                          
          87 EXT. WEAVER HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT 87 
                         
           Tracy pulls up to her house. As she pulls in she notices 
           Robbie. He's standing outside the front door in a 
           tuxedo... a shit-eating grin on his face. 
                         
           She SIGHS ("what now?") and parks the car.

           Meanwhile. Claire is putting away laundry. She throws 
           some underwear in Jessica's bottom drawer.
                         
           Notices something. An envelope. It's addressed to Cal
           Weaver. Curiosity piqued, she picks it up. Looks
           inside. Almost faints.
                         
                         
          89 INT. CLAIRE AND BERNIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 89
                         
           Big Bernie sits in a recliner, watching football and 
           drinking a cold one. Jessica lies on the floor, doing 
           homework.
                         
           Claire ENTERS, ashen. Zombie-like, she hands Bernie the
           envelope. Jessica looks up, sees it. 
                         
                          JESSICA
           No!!!!
                         
           She jumps, but it's too late.

           point: it's a father's worst nightmare.
                         
           Bernie, dazed, slides the pictures back into the
           envelope. He looks at the envelope again.

           Bernie puts a hand up. He can't speak. He marches out
           the door. From inside we hear a car SCREECH AWAY.

           Meanwhile. Tracy approaches Robbie. Not only is he 
           wearing a tuxedo, he's carrying a bunch of SCARVES. 
           Tracy LAUGHS.

           alive.
                         
           She can't help but smile. She kneels down, allowing
           Robbie to BLINDFOLD HER from behind.
                         
           He ties a SCARF around her eyes. Then ANOTHER at a
           different angle, double-knots it. Then ANOTHER!

           frightening. He looks down at passenger seat. At the
           ENVELOPE bearing Cal's address.
                         
           He RACES through a light. A HORN blares behind him.

           You may not be able to see it, but 
           I have. Over and over again. You
           are not to see him any more.

           Dad, c'mon, I'm not going to stop
           seeing him.
                         
           Cal turns away.

           Well then I don't have anything

           They EXIT. Cal lets them go, then grabs his things.

           Cal sits back at his usual table. This isn't "Cool Cal,"
           the Jacob disciple. No, this is "Sad Mess Cal." He's 
           grown a patchy beard. He's wearing a ratty sweatsuit. 
                         
           He's drinking, once again, vodka-cranberry out of a wimpy 
           red straw. It's pathetic. A WAITRESS APPROACHES.
                         
                          WAITRESS
           Can I get you another?

                          CAL
           2:30 would have been sufficient
           but I appreciate the judgment,
           Cocktail Waitress.
                          (THEN)
           Yes, another drink would be grand.
                         
           She EXITS.
                         
           Cal feels bad for that one. As she re-approaches: 
                         
                          CAL
           That was uncalled for. Sorry for
           being a dick.

           A small MIDDLE-SCHOOL AMPHITHEATER. About 150 people 
           fill the crowd of an intimate middle school graduation. 
                         
           Tracy, Molly, and Hannah sit in the front row. Jessica 
           sits with her family a few rows away. All look nice. 
                         
           MANY ROWS BACK -- 
                         
           Sits Cal, sandwiched between RANDOM SPECTATORS. Cal is 
           now shaven and well-dressed but he looks miserable. 
                         
           His eyes brighten for a moment as he notices... 
                         
           AN EMPTY SEAT between Tracy and Hannah. He leans 
           forward, are they saving it for him? But just then... 
           Jacob arrives. Kisses Hannah and takes "Cal's" seat. 
           Cal looks nauseous.

           VOICE (V.O.)
           ... and now, to introduce the 
           first student speaker: our very
           own English teacher Kate Thompson!
                         
           Cal's former conquest steps onto stage.

           Tracy looks away, clearly uncomfortable at the teacher's 
           presence. She accidentally catches Cal's eye. Awkward.

           class salutatorian, but he's also
           one of the most...

           Spirited... young men, I've ever
           had the pleasure of teaching.
           Ladies and gentlemen: Robbie
           Weaver.
                         
           Robbie takes the stage to APPLAUSE. This is not the same 
           kid we've come to love. There's something different in 
           his face. He's been broken. He spots JESSICA. 
                         
                          ROBBIE
           (a bit monotone) 
           Thank you, Mrs. Thompson. 
           Welcome, Class of 2011. 
                          (A BEAT) 
           I wasn't really sure what I wanted 
           to talk about today. Mrs. 
           Thompson said it might be good to 
           talk about growing up and getting 
           older and stuff. So I guess I'll 
           talk about that. 
                         
           Cal watches, concerned. Where's his son? 
                         
                          ROBBIE 
           I grew up a lot this year, I 
           think. I used to think that 
           growing up meant really growing. 
           Like getting taller and bigger. 
           But now I think that growing up 
           just makes you smaller. Your 
           dreams get smaller, and what you 
           want gets smaller... 
           (beat, then) 
           I grew an inch and a half this 
           year, but I feel a lot smaller. 
                         
           Cal sits forward, getting increasingly concerned. 
                         
                          ROBBIE 
           I was in love. And I know that 
           makes parents laugh because I'm 
           only thirteen but whatever, I was.

           I believed that there was one true 
           love for everyone, and if you 
           fought for that person, your one 
           true love would always work out. 
           But that's not how it works. It 
           sounded good when I was younger, 
           but... it's just not how it works. 
           There's no such thing as one true 
           love for everyo-- 
                         
           CAL (O.S.) 
           Stop! 
                         
           Robbie turns. Cal is STANDING in the middle of the 
           crowd. Everyone turns to look at him. 
                         
                          ROBBIE 
           Dad?

           Hi, everyone. 
                         
           Silence. No one knows what to do. Cal is suddenly 
           really uncomfortable. 
                         
                          CAL 
           May I have a word with my son? 
           It'll just take a second. 
                         
           Cal tries to extricate himself from his row. He steps 
           over people, squeezes by people, almost trips. 
                         
           Finally clear, he gathers himself, and tries to keep his 
           dignity as he marches down the aisle -- past his family. 
                         
           Robbie comes to the front of the stage, bends down.

           agree it was heading in a pretty 
           depressing direction. And I 
           basically wrote it for him. I 
           mean, I didn't literally write it 
           but I sure as hell influenced it, 
           and the kid's already a spitting 
           image of his mother and I'll be 
           damned if this is what he's going 
           to get from me.

           My son -- not him, my actual son -- 
           he believes in grand romantic 
           gestures. He believes that people 
           have soulmates. And we always 
           want to tell our thirteen-year- 
           olds that they're wrong, that `one 
           day you'll understand, young man.'

           about my `first date' the way dads 
           do. And I told him: `stop making 
           a big deal, Dad. I'm going to go 
           on lots of dates with plenty of 
           girls.' That was the first time I

           him, sweetly, on the cheek.
                         
                          JESSICA
           You take care, Robbie.
                         
           Robbie watches her go. Love-struck once more. Cal steps 
           up next to his son. 
                         
                          CAL
           You okay, buddy?

                          (RE: ENVELOPE) 
           I am now, Dad. I am now. 
                         
           Robbie runs off to join his friends. Cal smiles. 
                         
           TRACY (O.S.) 
           I'm terrified of what's going to 
           become of him once he hits 
           puberty. 
                         
           Cal turns, Tracy has been watching. 
                         
                          CAL 
           We might have to lock him up. 
                         
           Tracy smiles. Cal walks over toward her. 
                         
                          TRACY 
           You gave a good eighth grade 
           graduation speech. 
                         
                          CAL 
           I've been working on it for thirty 
           years, so... 
                         
           She LAUGHS, then... quiet. 
                         
                          TRACY 
           Do you think we can ever come back 
           from all this, Cal? 
                         
                          CAL 
           I don't know. I'd like to try 
           though. I know I'd like to try. 
                         
           She nods, thinking. 
                         
                          TRACY 
           Things are just so messed up. And 
           it's been such a strange year. 
           I've been in such a strange place. 
           And we have all these problems, so 
           many problems I've lost count, but 
           at the end of the day, I mean, the 
           only thing I know -- 
                         
           She stops herself, emotional. Then, simply: 
                         
                          TRACY 
           I am just so glad you took me for 
           that ice cream. 
                         
           Cal smiles. They share the moment in silence. And then:

           It was rocky road by the way. 
                         
                          CAL 
           No! 
                         
           As they JOKE and ARGUE about what flavor the ice cream 
           was, we PULL BACK. 
                         
           Off to the side, Robbie steps away from his friends and 
           watches them enjoy one another's company. 
                         
           He smiles. 
                         
           FADE OUT.
                         
                          THE END
