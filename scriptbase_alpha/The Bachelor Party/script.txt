                               by Paddy Chayefsky



     FADE IN.
 
     EXTERIOR. STUYVESANT TOWN HOUSING PROJECT -- DAY.
     Under the credits, the CAMERA PANS slowly across the project, 
     capturing the sober monotony, the endless straight apartment 
     houses. Seven o'clock in the morning.
 
                              DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
     INTERIOR. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM
     The bedroom of a two-and-a-half-room apartment in the housing 
     project. It is early morning, but the shades are drawn and 
     the room is dark. CAMERA moves slowly across the room, over 
     the large double bed on which Charlie and Helen Samson, a 
     young couple in their late twenties, are sleeping. They are 
     sleeping more or less on their sides, facing away from each 
     other. One of Helen's pajama-clad legs projects from under 
     the light covers. We close in on Charlie's sleeping face.
 
     The alarm clock at a distant end of the room suddenly bursts 
     into a soft relentless buzz. Charlie's eyes open. There is a 
     muffled movement at his side, and Helen gets up on one elbow. 
     Then she sits up, rises, and pads barefooted -- a rather 
     pretty girl in rumpled pajamas -- to the alarm clock and 
     turns it off. Charlie's head turns on the pillow so that he 
     can watch her. She pads back to the bed now and stands at the 
     foot, looking down at her husband. She produces a smile, then 
     turns and shuffles into the bathroom where she turns on the 
     wall switch. A shaft of light now pours into the bedroom.
 
     Charlie sits up in bed. His shoes and socks are on the floor 
     by his feet. He reaches down and starts to put them on. 
     Suddenly, from the recesses of the bathroom, Helen's rather 
     vague soprano lifts into the first lines of a popular song. 
     Then it stops as abruptly as it began. Charlie's head slowly 
     turns to look at the bathroom, back again to the business of 
     putting on his socks. His face is expressionless, but there 
     is no mistaking the sodden distaste he has for the world 
     today.
 
     He just sits on the bed, a young man of twenty-nine, clad 
     only in his pajama trousers, one sock dangling from his hand, 
     his head hanging, his shoulders slumped. Behind him, the 
     sudden noise of rushing tap water, then off. Then his wife 
     comes back into the bedroom. She is carrying a bath towel 
     with which she is drying her face. Finished, she drops the 
     towel on the bed and begins to dress. A moment later, she 
     pads around the corner of the bed to Charlie's front. She 
     is still barefooted and wears her pajama top, but she has 
     exchanged the trousers for a half-slip. Charlie hasn't moved 
     a muscle since the effort required to lift one sock from the 
     floor.
 
                    HELEN
          You think it's too early to call 
          my mother?
 
                    CHARLIE
          I don't know.
 
     Charlie shrugs without looking up. Helen goes out of the 
     bedroom, into the little square of foyer where there is a 
     telephone table with a telephone on it. She dials, waits. In 
     the bedroom, Charlie rubs his eyes with two fingers.
 
                    HELEN
               (on phone) 
          Hello, Ma, did I wake you up? This 
          is Helen.... Well, I'll be going to 
          work, and I wanted to get ahold of 
          you before I left. I called you last 
          night. Where were you and Pop anyway? 
          I kept calling you every half hour 
          up till one o'clock.... Oh, yeah? Did 
          you have a nice time? ...
 
     CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES IN FOR CLOSEUP
     of Charlie in bedroom.
 
                    HELEN'S VOICE
          Well, listen, Ma, I got something to 
          tell you. I'm pregnant.... Yeah, 
          pregnant.... Of course I'm sure. 
          I've got the report back from the 
          laboratory.... No, you wouldn't know 
          him, Doctor Axelrod.... Second month. 
          He says I can expect the baby in 
          February.... Well, Grandma, act a 
          little excited, will you? ... You 
          bet I'm excited....
 
     CLOSEUP OF CHARLIE 
     He is not excited. If anything he is miserable. His bowed 
     head rises slowly. The eyes open. He stares abstractedly 
     ahead for a moment. Then he sighs a profound sigh of 
     resignation. Then his eyes close again, and his head slowly 
     sinks back to its previous abjection. 
 
                              DISSOLVE TO:
 

     INTERIOR. THE KITCHEN -- HALF HOUR LATER 
     Helen, dressed in skirt and blouse now, is preparing two 
     cups of instant coffee, pouring hot water from the saucepan 
     into the two cups. The toaster is ticking. A packaged loaf 
     of white bread is open on the cupboard shelf. Finished with 
     pouring the water, Helen sets the saucepan back on the stove 
     and comes out into the dining area. The dinette table is 
     covered from end to end by open textbooks, several very large 
     accounting worksheets on which are scrawled meticulous 
     numbers, a ruler, several pencils and a pen, an ash tray 
     glutted with cigarettes, a cup and saucer. 
 
                    HELEN
               (calling to the bedroom)
          Do you need any of this or can I 
          take them off the table? 

     Charlie appears in the bedroom doorway, dressed and washed 
     now, a neat, clean young man in a white shirt and neatly 
     knotted tie.
 
                    CHARLIE
          I'll clean that up in a minute.
 
     He disappears back into the bedroom. Helen picks up the ash 
     tray and the cup and saucer.
 
                    HELEN
          How late were you up last night?
 
                    CHARLIE'S VOICE
          About two.
 
     INTERIOR. THE BEDROOM 
     Charlie standing by the window, is picking up his keys, a 
     few dollar bills, a comb, etc., from a chair and putting 
     them into his trouser pockets. The blinds of the bedroom 
     window have been opened, and the high August sun streams in, 
     whitening Charlie's face. After he has pocketed his odds and 
     ends, he moves to the chest of drawers on which, among all 
     sorts of other things, there are several textbooks and an 
     opened notebook. He stands a moment looking down into the 
     open notebook, his lips moving ever so little, as he commits 
     some of his notes to memory. He turns a page of the notebook 
     back to check something and then goes back to the previous 
     page. Now he opens one of the smaller drawers in the chest 
     of drawers. The drawer contains wisps of his wife's stockings 
     and other feminine things. He finds a small roll of bills and 
     takes one of them, putting the bill in his pocket and closing 
     the dresser drawer. 

                    CHARLIE
          I'm taking five bucks from your 
          drawer. 

     He pauses now to affix a less frowning expression onto his 
     face and goes out into the little foyer and into the dining 
     area.

     INTERIOR. THE DINING AREA
     Helen is seated at the dinette table, sipping coffee and 
     reading yesterday's newspaper. There are two cups of coffee 
     on the table.
 
                    CHARLIE
          A guy in my office is getting 
          married, and I got clipped four 
          bucks for his wedding present.
 
     He begins assembling the mass of papers and textbooks on the 
     table.
 
                    HELEN
          Who's getting married?
 
                    CHARLIE
          Arnold. I told you about him. The 
          guy with the sick mother.
 
                    HELEN
          Oh, yeah.
 
                    CHARLIE
               (trying to decide 
               whether he needs a 
               certain worksheet) 
          The rest of the guys are giving him 
          a bachelor party tonight.
 
                    HELEN
          Do you want to go, Charlie?
 
                    CHARLIE
          I got class tonight.
 
                    HELEN
          What have you got -- cost accounting?
 
                    CHARLIE
          Yes.

                    HELEN
          I think you ought to take off a 
          night. You ought to go, have a little 
          fun for yourself. I think you need 
          that. You go to work all day, you go 
          to school all night. You can miss one 
          night, Charlie.
 
                    CHARLIE
          No, these bachelor parties get kind 
          of wild sometimes. The whole 
          philosophy is: it's the groom's last 
          night of freedom. So it gets kind of 
          wild sometimes.
 
                    HELEN
          That's a good philosophy to start a 
          marriage with.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Well, a bunch of guys get together, 
          they like to tear up the town a 
          little.
 
     He has assembled his notes and notebooks and texts in a pile 
     on the table, ready to take with him. He sits down and 
     begins sipping his coffee. Helen looks back to her newspaper, 
     frowning a little, then looks up at Charlie again.
 
                    HELEN
          I think you oughta go, Charlie. I 
          know you're upset about the baby.
 
                    CHARLIE
          I'm not upset about the baby.
 
                    HELEN
          Come on, Charlie. I know how you 
          feel. Listen, you don't have to 
          pretend you're excited about the 
          baby. We weren't exactly planning 
          on a baby right now ...
 
                    CHARLIE
          I'm not upset about the baby.
 
                    HELEN
          It's a shock. I had some bad days 
          before I told you. I said: "Oh, boy, 
          that's all we need. A baby." Then I 
          said to myself: "If I'm having a 
          baby, I'm having a baby. That's all 
          there is to it." And I like the idea. 
          We're going to have a family, 
          Charlie. I like the idea.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Well, give me a couple of days to 
          get used to the idea. I'll be all 
          right.
 
                    HELEN
          I know you will, Charlie. That's why 
          I think you ought to go to this 
          bachelor party tonight.
 
                    CHARLIE
               (bursting out) 
          I don't want to go to this bachelor 
          party.
 
     He looks down at his coffee, embarrassed at the outburst.
 
                    CHARLIE
          I'm sorry I yelled.
 
                    HELEN
          Don't be silly.
 
                    CHARLIE
          I better get going. Kenny's probably 
          waiting for me now. I'm sorry I 
          yelled like that.
 
                    HELEN
          What are you sorry about? Don't I 
          yell at you all the time?
 
     WE STAY ON HELEN, as she reads her newspaper, but there is 
     a faint frown on her face.

     INTERIOR. LOCAL PLATFORM EASTSIDE IRT SUBWAY
     An express train hurtles southward. We see it flashing by 
     through the concrete pillars of the subway. 
 
                              DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
     IRT EXPRESS HURTLING SOUTHWARD
     Charlie and another young man, named Kenneth, are seated in 
     a crowded subway car. People are standing tightly in the 
     aisles. Kenneth is an amiable young man of thirty-odd. He 
     has his jacket off and his tie loosened as a concession to 
     the August heat. Charlie is neatly and coolly dressed. He 
     has two notebooks and a battered text in his lap. He is 
     reading the text. Two young white-collar workers on their 
     way to work. They ride along silently for a moment. Kenneth 
     is rather stealthily concerned with a full-busted young 
     woman who is standing directly in front of him, holding on 
     to a strap. It is summertime, and the girls all wear light 
     summer frocks. There is a feeling of wistful sensuality to 
     the scene.
 
                    KENNETH
          You going to Arnold's bachelor party?
 
                    CHARLIE
          I don't think so, Kennie. 

                    KENNETH
          What?

                    CHARLIE
          I got two classes tonight.

                    KENNETH
          Yeah, I was going to go, but I think 
          I better not, because my kid, the 
          young one, the girl, she's been 
          acting up again lately. She's got 
          some kind of allergy, the doctors 
          don't know what.
 
                    CHARLIE
          These bachelor parties get kind of 
          wild sometimes. Eddie Watkins is 
          making all the arrangements. He's 
          probably got us lined up with a 
          bunch of chorus girls.

                    KENNETH
          Yeah, do you think so?
 
                    CHARLIE
          You know Eddie.
 
                    KENNETH
          Yeah, boy, he really lives it up, 
          don't he? Did you see that blonde 
          who picked him up for lunch last 
          week? Boy, sometimes I wish I was a 
          bachelor. Well, you know what I mean. 
          I never seem to get out of the house 
          any more, you know what I mean? 
          About once a week, I go to the 
          movies. We never even see the whole 
          picture. My wife starts worrying 
          about the kids. My youngest kid, the 
          girl, she's got some kind of rash. 
          We don't know what it is. I never 
          seem to see anybody any more. Do you 
          know how long it is since I've seen 
          Willie Duff? I haven't seen Willie 
          in about six months. My wife can't 
          stand his wife. You ever seen her, 
          Willie's wife?
 
                    CHARLIE
          No, I didn't know Willie too well. 

                    KENNETH
          Boy, wait'll you have kids, boy. 
          You'll never get out of the house.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Helen's pregnant now.
 
                    KENNETH
          No kidding.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Yeah.
 
                    KENNETH
          Oh, that's wonderful, Charlie, 
          that's wonderful! 

     The two young husbands look down again at their hands and 
     ride along silently. Kenneth sneaks a quick look up at the 
     girl standing in front of him, and then lets his attention 
     drift down the length of the car.
 
                    KENNETH
          Hey, there's a guy down there, 
          trying to pick up a girl down there.
 
     He is referring to a Young Fellow who elbowed his way down 
     through the crowded aisle but who stopped abruptly when he 
     noticed an attractive girl, seated about three seats down 
     from Kenneth. The Girl is reading a newspaper. The Young 
     Fellow stares at her. The Girl, aware of this sudden 
     attention, looks briefly up from her newspaper. The Young 
     Fellow smiles pleasantly. The Girl, with a show of 
     annoyance, looks back to her newspaper.
 
                    KENNETH
          Were you with us about eight years 
          ago when I picked up that chick in 
          front of the bus stop in Paterson, 
          New Jersey?
 
                    CHARLIE
          When was this?
 
                    KENNETH
          Yeah, you were there. You were with 
          that girl from Brooklyn. We just 
          came from Palisades Amusement Park, 
          and we were driving Frankie Klein's 
          girl home, and the car broke down 
          right in the middle of Route One.
 
                    CHARLIE
               (beginning to laugh) 
          Oh, yeah.
 
                    KENNETH
               (laughing) 
          And Frankie opened up the hood and 
          the water cap blew right up in the 
          air.
 
                    CHARLIE
          And the cop came over ... 
 
                    KENNETH
          That's right, the cop. He thought 
          Frankie shot off a gun....
 
     They are both laughing audibly now at the memory.
 
                    KENNETH
          He was going to pull us all in. Oh, 
          man!
 
                    CHARLIE
          Frankie, he was funny.
 
                    KENNETH
          Oh, that was a lot of fun, those 
          days.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Yeah, they were.
 
     The little spasm of laughter is over. A sort of ruefulness 
     settles down on the two young husbands. Kenneth looks lazily 
     down the aisle to see how the Young Fellow is making out 
     with The Girl. He seems to be making out all right. They are 
     looking steadily at each other now. Kenneth turns back to 
     Charlie.
 
                    KENNETH
          Hey, this guy's making out all right. 
          She's giving him the eye now.

     Charlie leans forward to see this progress.
 
                    KENNETH
               (looking out the 
               window at the passing 
               local station) 
          Where are we now, Prince Street? I 
          bet you he picks her up before we 
          hit Chambers Street.
 
     Somehow this has a sobering effect on the two young husbands. 
     Again they sit silently as the train buckets along.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Boy, I'm bushed today. I was up till 
          two o'clock last night on this thing 
          here. I'm getting to be a nervous 
          wreck. I snarled at Helen this 
          morning. I think this whole night 
          school business is getting me down. 

                    KENNETH
          I don't see how you do it.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Neither do I. I thought I was 
          through with it. The plan was for me 
          to quit work and go to college full 
          time and cram through in a year or 
          so. But now we got this kid coming, 
          and Helen's going to have to quit 
          her job, and that sets me back where 
          I started from. Another five years 
          of this, summers included.
 
                    KENNETH
          I couldn't do it, man, I'll tell you 
          that. I wish I could, but I couldn't.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Oh, what am I griping about? This is 
          the life I picked out for myself. 
          But it's a grind, boy, I tell you. 

     They sit silently again. The train hurtles along and then 
     suddenly slows as it approaches a stop. There is a rustle of 
     movement among the passengers in the subway car. A few 
     people start edging toward the doors. The Girl reading the 
     newspaper now folds her newspaper and stands almost directly 
     in the Young Fellow's face. They regard each other.
 
                    YOUNG FELLOW
               (to the girl)
          Excuse me, can you tell me how to 
          get to the Nassau Street exit?
 
                    GIRL
          Well ... well, at the top of the 
          stairs, you'll see all the signs.
 
                    YOUNG FELLOW
          Are you getting off here?
 
                    GIRL
          Yes.
 
                    YOUNG FELLOW
          Well, I'll follow you then. That'll 
          be easier, if you don't mind.
 
                    GIRL
          No, not at all.
 
     They start to crowd down the aisle. The train is chugging 
     into the Chambers Street station, and we can see the 
     yellowed lights of the platform and the quick blur of faces. 
     The two young husbands, who had been following the byplay 
     between The Girl and the Young Fellow, now watch them slowly 
     exit. There is an expression of poignant wistfulness on both 
     their faces.
 
                              DISSOLVE TO:
 

     EXTERIOR. THE OFFICE
     We look down on the bookkeeping department of a life 
     insurance company in downtown Manhattan area around Pine 
     Street. It is a fairly large room, large enough to hold 
     eleven desks. But you get the feeling that this is one of 
     the smaller offices on the floor. You get the feeling that 
     this company occupies three or four floors of this building. 
     Despite the size of the office, it has a cluttered look. 
     Each desk has piles of paper on it, and all the impedimenta 
     of the bookkeeper -- the pens and pencils, the adding 
     machine, the telephone. Some of the desks have typewriters. 
     Along the walls there are rows of filing cabinets and wall 
     bins stocked with large worksheets and thick ledgers. At 
     the far end of the room, there is a row of windows, but it 
     is still necessary to keep the overhead fluorescent lights 
     on all day. They are on now. There are two middle-aged 
     women standing, murmuring to each other, and a rather 
     heavy-set balding man in his late forties, sitting at a 
     desk in his shirt sleeves, already hard at work, although 
     it is still ten minutes shy of eight-thirty.
 
     Kenneth and Charlie enter. Ad lib hellos between them and 
     the two middle-aged women. Charlie moves to the coat rack to 
     hang up his jacket, drops off his books on his desk, starts 
     for the coat rack. Behind Charlie, we see Kenneth, carrying 
     his jacket, moving to his desk, up where the middle-aged man 
     is working.
 
                    KENNETH
          Hiya, Walter.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Hiya, Walter.
 
     Walter, the middle-aged man, nods his good mornings.
 
                    KENNETH
               (poking in his desk 
               drawer; amiably) 
          Walter, what time do you come in in 
          the mornings? You're making us all 
          look lousy, you know that? I get 
          the feeling sometimes, you stay here 
          overnight. 

     Walter merely nods, doesn't bother to look up from the work. 
     Kenneth finds a stick of gum in his drawer, unwraps it. Two 
     more women, gray-haired and bespectacled, come into the 
     office. There is an ad lib mumble of hellos in background. 
     Charlie hangs up his jacket on the coat rack.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Arnold in yet?
 
                    WALTER
          He starts his vacation today. He's 
          getting married Sunday, you know.
 
     CLOSEUP of Charlie looking out the window into the bright 
     August morning. His face is just a little ruffled by a 
     frown, and there is a kind of pain in his eyes. Behind him, 
     Walter and Kenneth.
 
                    WALTER
               (a nervous, anxious man) 
          Well, the doctor was over last night. 
          Brought over the X rays; brought 
          over the allergy tests. Brought over 
          a bill for sixty-eight dollars.  I 
          said to him: "Doctor, you're a young 
          man, professional, highly educated, 
          four years of college, two years of 
          premedical training, several years 
          of interning, of residency. If 
          you're so smart, how can you charge 
          me sixty-eight dollars? One thing 
          they apparently didn't teach you in 
          medical school. You can't get blood 
          from a stone."
 
                    KENNETH
          So what's wrong with you, Walter?
 
                    WALTER
          What's wrong? I have to go to 
          Arizona, that's what's wrong. I have 
          asthma. When I was a kid, they 
          called it hay fever, and you carried
          a bag around your neck. Asafetida. 
          Now, they call it asthma, and you 
          have to go to Arizona. I said to him: 
          "Doctor, you're a professional man, 
          four years of college, premedical 
          school, Bellevue, several diplomas. 
          Answer me a question. Who's going to 
          pay for Arizona?" I said to him: 
          "Doctor," I said, "perhaps you have 
          the illusion I am the Aga Khan. I 
          have a bearing about me, perhaps, 
          that misleads you to believe I have 
          blood ties with the Whitneys and the 
          Rockefellers. This isn't true." 
          Arizona. Did you ever hear of such 
          nonsense?
 
                    KENNETH
          How serious is it, Walter?
 
                    WALTER
          Serious. Nothing serious. I have hay 
          fever, I sneeze a couple of times. 
          The idiot told my wife I have to go 
          to Arizona, and she wouldn't leave 
          me alone all night. She's already 
          packing the bags. I said: "For 
          heaven's sakes, you listen to 
          doctors, we'll all be dead." My son, 
          Harold, believe me, he's going to be 
          a doctor. That's some racket, boy. 
          Sixty-eight dollars.
 
     CLOSEUP of Charlie, still at the window, when a bell 
     suddenly clangs, indicating the start of the workday. The 
     sudden jangle makes him start, and he closes his eyes 
     briefly against the noise.  Walter, in background, who had 
     risen and was bent over Kenneth's desk, darts nervously back 
     to his own desk.
 
                    WALTER
          You better get to work. Hey, Charlie, 
          that was the bell. I think Flaherty 
          is here this morning. We'll all be 
          fired today. I have a feeling.
 
     He hunches over his ledgers again, his anxious, harried face 
     drawn into intense wrinkles of concentration. Several other 
     women have come into the office by now, and there is a 
     general movement to the desks. There is the click of a 
     typewriter, and Walter runs his fingers glibly over the 
     adding machine on his desk. The day has started.
 
     After a moment, Charlie turns from the window and comes back 
     to his desk, sinks down onto his chair.
 
                              DISSOLVE TO:
 

     INTERIOR. THE OFFICE -- TWENTY MINUTES LATER
     We look down on the bookkeeping department. All the desks 
     are occupied but two. There are six women and our three men. 
     The office is silent with industry, everybody's head bent 
     over his desk. There is the occasional punctuation of an 
     adding machine or a typewriter or a phone ringing.
 
     Our three men are bent over their tally sheets, worksheets, 
     and ledgers, occasionally reaching up to quickly tabulate 
     something on the adding machine. After a moment, Walter says:
 
                    WALTER
               (without looking 
               up from his work) 
          You fellows going to Arnold's party 
          tonight? 
 
                    KENNETH
               (without looking up) 
          No, I'm not going, are you?
 
                    WALTER
          No. Eddie already hooked me for four 
          bucks for Arnold's present. This 
          dinner is going to cost another 
          couple of good dollars.
 
                    CHARLIE
          It looks like nobody's going to 
          Arnold's bachelor party.
 
                    WALTER
          You ain't going?
 
                    CHARLIE
          No, I'm not going. 

                    WALTER
          Eddie's going to be mad. 

                    CHARLIE
          I told Eddie last week I couldn't 
          make it. I've got school. Eddie's a 
          bachelor. It's all right for him to 
          go rooting around town, picking up 
          girls.
 
                    WALTER
          Yeah, you get married you give that 
          kind of thing up.
 
                    KENNETH
          Yeah, Charlie says Eddie has a whole 
          bunch of chorus girls lined up for 
          us tonight.
 
     Walter's head comes up for the first time.
 
                    WALTER
          No kidding. 

                    CHARLIE
          I didn't say that. I just said that 
          if I knew Eddie, we'd probably wind 
          up with some of his crazy girl 
          friends. 

     Walter looks back down to his work again. 
 
                    KENNETH
          I don't know where he gets all these 
          girls. He's a screwy looking jerk.
 
                    WALTER
          Did you see that blonde who was up 
          here looking for him last week?

                    KENNETH
          Yeah. He told me she was a 
          television actress. I think I saw 
          her once on "Studio One." She was in 
          a coal mine with some stir-crazy 
          coalminer who was trying to strangle 
          her with a necktie.
 
                    WALTER
          I'd like to strangle her with a 
          necktie.
 
                    KENNETH
          Now, Walter, an old married man like 
          you, with asthma and everything.
 
     Walter looks up suddenly from his work, a strange sting of 
     pain crossing his face.
 
                    WALTER
          I get real jealous of Eddie 
          sometimes. He's as free as a bird. 
          Did you see that convertible he's 
          got?
 
                    KENNETH
          Yeah, he really banged it up I hear.
 
                    WALTER
          You ought to see the old heap I've 
          got. He walks out of here on payday, 
          he can spend the whole works on 
          having himself a good time. I walk 
          out of here, and I got three kids 
          and a wife, all of them with their 
          palms out. I lost two bucks playing 
          poker at my house last week. It was 
          an economic catastrophe. My wife 
          didn't sleep all night.

                    CHARLIE
          He's late again.
 
                    WALTER
          He'll be twenty minutes late again. 
          If Flaherty walked in now, he'd fire 
          him. If that ever happened to me, I 
          think I'd kill myself. What does 
          Eddie care? So he scrambles around 
          for another job. Flaherty told me 
          last week I had too many days off. 
          I told him I was sick in bed. What 
          do you want me to do?
 
     He turns back again to his work, his face creased with 
     anxiety. The three men work silently for a moment. Then the 
     office door opens, and a man of about thirty-five, a little 
     stout, but rather casual in his dress, wearing steel-rimmed 
     glasses, enters. This is Eddie Watkins, the office bachelor. 
     He seems to have had very little sleep the night before. His 
     eyes, behind the wire-rimmed glasses, are heavy-lidded. A 
     cigarette dangles listlessly, from his mouth. There is 
     something of the bacchanalian libertine about Eddie. There 
     is a perfunctory exchange of hellos and good mornings, 
     establishing that this is Eddie. He shuffles with ineffable 
     weariness to his desk.
 
                    WALTER
          Hi, Eddie, you're early today, only 
          twenty minutes late, what happened?
 
                    EDDIE
               (muttering through 
               reluctant lips) 
          Flaherty come in yet?
 
                    KENNETH
          No.
 
     Eddie sits down at his desk, pulls his cigarette 
     automatically for a moment. Then he reaches over to a pile 
     of telephone directories on the floor beside his desk, pulls 
     up the Manhattan one, flips through the pages, finding the 
     number he wants. He picks up the phone. 
 
                    EDDIE
          Mary, give me an outside line....
               (he pauses, checks 
               the number in the 
               phone book again, 
               dials, waits) 
          Hello, is this Leathercraft on 
          Madison Avenue? ... This is Mr. 
          Watkins. I was in about a week ago. 
          I ordered a military set and a 
          wallet. They were supposed to be 
          ready yesterday.... Yes, please, 
          would you? ... 
               (he is searching 
               his pockets while 
               he waits, finds a 
               piece of paper, 
               pulls it out) 
          Yeah, a military set and a wallet....
 
                    WALTER
          Is that what we bought poor Arnold?
 
                    EDDIE
               (on phone) 
          That's right. The following 
          inscriptions should be on them:
               (reads from the paper) 
          On the military set: "To Arnold: 
          Best wishes on your marriage from 
          Alice, Charlie, Eddie, Evelyn, 
          Jeanette with two t's, Kenneth, 
          Lucy, Mary, Olga, Walter, and 
          Flaherty." Now on the wallet ... 
          Yeah, what? .... Yeah, that's right 
          -- Flaherty. Now, on the wallet, 
          the following inscription: "To my 
          Best Friend Arnold from his Best Man 
          Eddie." ... No, to my best friend 
          Arnold. ... That's right. "From his 
          best man Eddie" ... Now, can I come 
          in at lunch and pick them up? ... 

     A young woman comes into the office, goes to Walter's desk 
     and drops some papers before him.
 
                    WALTER
          What's this, Jeanette?
 
                    GIRL
          It's from finance, don't ask me.
 
     This is the girl in the office who goes to the water cooler 
     three times a morning and all the men covertly watch her. 
     She is cute, but attractive more by comparison to the other 
     women in the office. Nevertheless, all the men, including 
     Eddie and Charlie, let their eyes cautiously watch her as 
     she leaves, her sheath dress tight on her hips.
 
     Eddie, who has hung up, now rubs his eyes with two fingers to 
     clear his head and picks up the phone again.
 
                    EDDIE
               (on phone) 
          Mary, give me the Hotel Westmore. 
          Circle 7-0598.
 
                    CHARLIE
               (hands Kennie paper) 
          This isn't for me -- it's for you.
 
                    EDDIE
               (to the others) 
          Now who owes me on the presents? 
          Charlie, you owe me?
 
                    CHARLIE
          I gave you four bucks yesterday....
 
                    KENNETH
          I owe you, Eddie. I'll pay you 
          tomorrow, payday.
 
                    EDDIE
               (on phone) 
          Miss Frances Kelley, please. I 
          think it's room 417.... 

     The three heads around him look slowly up from their 
     respective work, naked interest manifest on their faces.
 
                    EDDIE
               (calling to one 
               of the women in 
               the office) 
          Hey, Evelyn, you owe me four bucks. 

                    EVELYN
               (calling back) 
          All right. I know.
 
                    EDDIE
               (on phone) 
          Hello, Frances, this is Eddie.... 
          All right, wait a minute. Give me a 
          chance to explain.... I know I woke 
          you up.... All right, let me tell 
          you. You know I'm supposed to be the 
          best man at this fellow Arnold's 
          wedding. So I called him up last 
          night because I didn't know whether 
          I was supposed to wear tuxedo or 
          tails. Well, he didn't know either, 
          so he said: "Come on over to my 
          girl's house with me tonight. 
          They're making all the arrangements 
          for the wedding now." So I called 
          you and left a message at the desk 
          saying I couldn't get over till 
          about ten o'clock.... All right! 
          That's what I'm going to explain! 
          ... Thank you.
               (holds receiver 
               against his chest 
               and looks at his 
               colleagues with 
               air of a man being 
               tried just a little 
               too much. Returns 
               receiver to his ear, 
               listens for a moment) 
          All right, so I had to go over to 
          Arnold's girl's house with Arnold 
          last night. Well, there was about 
          thirty people there, and, man, you 
          never saw such a crazy mess. There 
          was this little bald-headed guy 
          there. He's the bride's uncle. He's 
          come all the way down from Boston 
          with his whole family to go to the 
          wedding. The only trouble was, he 
          wasn't invited. Well, this crazy 
          uncle, he grabs ahold of me, he 
          starts shaking me by the lapels. So 
          I said: "What do you want from me? 
          I ain't the groom! I'm just trying 
          to find out whether I'm supposed to 
          wear tuxedo or tails." 
               (apparently this got 
               a laugh. Eddie breaks 
               into a smile) 
          Funny, huh? ... Look, Frances. I 
          have to go to work now. I'm calling 
          you from the office. How about 
          letting me make this up to you? I'll 
          take you out to dinner Saturday 
          night.... I can't make it tonight. 
          The bachelor party's tonight.... 
          All right, Saturday night.... It's a 
          date.... S'help me.... I swear, right 
          on time. Eight-thirty, okay? ... 
          Okay, we'll have a ball. Goodbye, go 
          back to sleep.
 
     He hangs up. The three married men look down again to their 
     ledgers and tap away again on their adding machines. Eddie 
     sits slumped in his seat for a moment.
 
                    EDDIE
          What did I just tell that girl, 
          Saturday night?
 
                    KENNETH
          Yeah.
 
                    EDDIE
               (picks up phone)
          Mary, give me Columbus 5-1098.... 
          What do you mean personal calls! 
          These are business calls! Well, stop 
          listening to other people's 
          conversations.... What have you got, 
          stock in the company? Columbus 
          5-1098. 
               (waits)
 
                    KENNETH
          Listen, Eddie, I don't think I can 
          go tonight. My father-in-law's in 
          from Akron, Ohio, and----
 
                    EDDIE
               (all sweetness) 
          Hello, who is this, Mrs. Stebbins? 
          ... This is Eddie, Mrs. Stebbins. I 
          wonder if I can talk to Muriel.... 
          Could I speak to her? ... Thank 
          you.... 

     The three married men each look up slowly again, naked envy 
     on each face.
 
                    EDDIE
               (on phone) 
          Muriel, baby, listen, sweetie, I 
          can't make it Saturday night.... I'm 
          all loused up with this wedding I'm 
          supposed to be the best man at.... 
          We have to rehearse the ceremony. 
          You'd think they were getting 
          married on television.... Yes, 
          sweetie, why don't I call you Monday. 
          Maybe, we'll work out something 
          before you go back to California.... 
          All right, sweetie, good-bye.

     He hangs up, sits a moment, then finally removes the 
     cigarette from his mouth, crushes it in his ash tray, and 
     turns to the others.
 
                    EDDIE
          Well, what do you say? I'm going to 
          call Louie and make a reservation 
          for a table for tonight. Who's 
          coming and who isn't? Walter, you're 
          coming, right? It won't cost you 
          more than three-fifty for the whole 
          meal. What do you say, Walter? You 
          only live once.
 
                    WALTER
               (strangely sad) 
          That's right. You only live once.
 
                    EDDIE
          Well, yes or no?
 
                    WALTER
          All right, I'll come.
 
                    EDDIE
          Kennie?
 
                    KENNETH
          Yeah, I'll get out of the house for 
          a change.
 
                    EDDIE
          How about you, Charlie?
 
     Charlie is frowning down at a sheaf of adding machine totals 
     in front of him.
 
                    CHARLIE
          I don't think so, Eddie.
 
                    KENNETH
          Ah, come on, Charlie, you got to 
          bust loose every now and then. We'll 
          have a couple of drinks.
 
                    EDDIE
               (picks up phone) 
          Mary, give me an outside line and 
          don't give me no trouble.... 
          Chickering 4-5099. 
 
                    WALTER
          Come on, Charlie, it's a short life, 
          believe me. 

     Move in for CLOSEUP of Charlie, frowning. Over this, Eddie's 
     voice.
 
                    EDDIE'S VOICE
          Hello, hello, Louie? Is this Louie? 
          ... Louie, this is Eddie Watkins. 
          I'd like to reserve a table for 
          four for tonight.... For four ...

                    CHARLIE
          Hey, Eddie ...
 
                    EDDIE'S VOICE
          What?
 
                    CHARLIE
          Count me in.
 
     He immediately bends back to his work, takes his pencil up 
     again. CAMERA PULLS QUICKLY UP AND AWAY until we have an 
     ANGLE SHOT looking down at their desks in various positions 
     of work.
 
                    EDDIE
               (on phone) 
          Louie, make that five.... Five guys 
          ... Yeah, a bachelor party ...
 
                              FADE OUT

 
     FADE IN 

     EXTERIOR. DOWNTOWN NEW YORK CITY -- NIGHT
 
     FADE IN with a big loud blare on Eighth Street in Greenwich 
     Village on a warm August night. Packed sidewalks, jammed 
     traffic, taxis, trucks, buses, honking of horns, etc. 
     Man-we're-going-to-have-a-ball type feeling.

                              DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
     EXTERIOR. STREET -- NIGHT
     Thirteenth Street off Sixth Avenue not so blary and lit up 
     as the main drags, but traffic is heavy, and there are lots 
     of people on the sidewalks. There are a number of restaurants 
     dotting the street with their little striped awnings and 
     modest neons. If we are on our toes, we notice one neon that 
     reads: "LOUIE'S."
 
                              DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
     INTERIOR. LOUIE'S RESTAURANT
     The entire interior isn't too much to show, really. It's a 
     small restaurant, but it is packed. Waiters scurry here and 
     there. People jammer and jab. Hustle and bustle. In 
     background, we can pick out our bachelor party, five men now, 
     clustered around a table, yakking it up.
 
     WIDE SHOT of our bachelor party, showing all five. They all 
     seem to be in the best of spirits. The new member of the cast 
     is Arnold, the groom, a towheaded, pleasant-looking young man 
     of thirty, shy to the point of being noticeable. Of all the 
     men at the party, he is the quietest. He sits, a smile nailed 
     onto his face, turning his head from one friend to another as 
     they talk, enjoying the rare privilege of being liked. The 
     dinner is over. During the ensuing scene, a bus boy continues 
     to remove the used dishes. Several large bottles of beer and 
     two fifths of Scotch are on the table. There is a welter of 
     variously assorted glasses. Eddie, Walter, and Kenneth are 
     smoking cigars, Charlie a cigarette. The Groom is not 
     smoking.  We have cut into the scene during a jumble of 
     conversation. Walter is talking to Charlie, whose head is 
     bent toward the older man. Kenneth is trying to tell the 
     Groom a joke, but the Groom's attention is being distracted
     by Eddie, who is leaning across the table trying to get 
     Charlie's attention. Ad libs.
 
                    KENNETH
               (finishing story) 
          Three hundred pounds! Isn't she kind 
          of fat? No, man, tall! Hey, waiter! 
          Waiter!
 
                    EDDIE
          Hey, Charlie ...
 
                    WALTER
               (to Charlie) 
          ... so we were stationed right 
          outside Paris, about eight miles, a 
          town called Chatou ...
 
                    EDDIE
          ... hey, Charlie ...
 
                    WALTER
               (to Charlie) 
          ... so the first night, a whole 
          bunch of us swiped a jeep out of the 
          motor court. We had a feller there 
          who was a tech sergeant in the motor 
          court. Oh, what a character he was! 
          He used to get loaded every night on 
          that vanilla extract.
 
                    EDDIE
          Hey, Charlie ...
 
                    CHARLIE
          What do you want, Eddie?
 
                    EDDIE
          Hey, Charlie, did I ever tell you 
          about the time I was stationed at 
          Buckley Field in Denver, and I 
          picked up this girl in Lakeside 
          Amusement Park?
 
                    WALTER
          Hey, Eddie, listen to this story 
          I'm telling Charlie. Hey, Arnold, 
          I'm telling Charlie about the time 
          me and that crazy tech sergeant 
          from the motor court got loaded on 
          vanilla extract and went to Paris 
          ... Hey, Kenneth ...
 
                    KENNETH
          When do the Giants come back from 
          their road trip, does anybody know?
 
                    EDDIE
          Hey, let's give out the presents now.
 
                    WALTER
          Hey, Kenneth, listen to this story. 
          I was stationed outside of Paris, 
          about eight miles ...
 
                    CHARLIE
          What?
 
                    KENNETH
          Oh, that Paris! I was there for two 
          days! Clubs! You had to beat the 
          women off with clubs! ...
 
                    CHARLIE
               (to people at 
               another table) 
          What ...? Oh, it's a bachelor party 
          -- this guy's getting married.
 
                    EDDIE
          Listen, I want to give the 
          presents ...
 
                    WALTER
          Well, let me tell you what 
          happened ...
 
                    EDDIE
          Hey, you know what was a great town 
          for women, Hamburg!
 
                    KENNETH
          Hamburg! Clubs! Clubs! You had to 
          beat them off with clubs! Hey, 
          waiter -- who's our waiter?  
 
                    CHARLIE
          Hey, Arnold, enjoying yourself?
 
                    EDDIE
          The first night I was in Hamburg, 
          two Frauleins come walking right in 
          the barracks. So I said to the 
          lieutenant ...
 
     Walter, who is pretty lit, suddenly stands and bangs the 
     table mightily with his fist.
 
                    WALTER
               (bellowing out) 
          The best fighting outfit in the 
          whole fighting army was the fighting 
          Hundred and Fourth Infantry Division, 
          General Terry Allen commanding!
 
     This brings the jumbled conversation to a halt. Walter 
     surveys the other four, looking for possible challenges, 
     then sits heavily down.
 
                    EDDIE
               (standing) 
          Well, now that we got that settled....
 
                    CHARLIE
          I'm with you, Walter.
 
                    ARNOLD
          We believe you, Walter.
 
                    EDDIE
          I'd like to make a little speech to 
          our guest of honor and mutual friend, 
          Arnold Craig. Arnold, a bunch of us 
          down the office, the girls too, all 
          chipped in, and we got you a couple 
          of small gifts....
 
     Eddie crosses to extra chair, picks up wrapped gifts, crosses 
     back to his place.
 
                    WALTER
               (whispering to Kenneth) 
          These are the gag gifts. 
 
                    EDDIE
          Let's see, what's this one? Oh, yeah. 
          Arnold, we figured Louise might be 
          very sleepy on your wedding night, 
          so we thought you might want 
          something to keep you warm.
 
     Walter leans forward to see what the tissue-wrapped parcel 
     Arnold is now unwrapping is.
 
                    WALTER
          What is it? What is it?
 
     Arnold holds a hot-water bottle aloft. Walter is seized with 
     a paroxysm of laughter at this immensely Rabelaisian gift.
 
                    WALTER
          It's a hot-water bottle!
 
                    KENNETH
          Okay, Walter, okay.
 
                    WALTER
          Hey, did you see that? Hey, he bought 
          him a hot-water bottle for his 
          wedding night. Hey, that's funny ...
 
                    CHARLIE
          Hey, Eddie, you should have bought 
          him an ice pack for after tonight.
 
                    EDDIE
               (holding a 
               second parcel)
          Walter, take it easy.... Now, this 
          one, Arnold, this one is something 
          to keep you busy on cold winter 
          nights.
 
                    WALTER
               (crosses to Arnold; 
               to the others) 
          This ought to be good.
 
                    EDDIE
          Look at Walter.
 
     Walter has come around behind Arnold's chair and can hardly 
     wait to see what the next joke is.

                    WALTER
          Hey, these are funny. Who bought 
          these? You buy these, Eddie? These 
          are funny. You got a good sense of 
          humor.
 
     Arnold unwraps the parcel, holds out a miniature baby bottle. 
     This is too much for Walter; how funny can you get? He 
     clutches his sides.
 
                    WALTER
          Hey, did you guys see that? Hey, did 
          you guys see that?
 
                    CHARLIE
          Come on, Walter, sit down.
 
     Charlie and Kenneth are smiling appreciatively. Walter 
     crosses with bottle, sits, starts pouring whisky into baby 
     bottle.
 
                    WALTER
          Eddie got a good sense of humor, you 
          know?
 
                    KENNETH
               (to Charlie) 
          Boy, old Walter is crocked.
 
                    ARNOLD
               (smiling, rising 
               halfway in his chair) 
          Listen, I want to thank you. Really. 
          I really want to thank you fellows.
 
                    EDDIE
          We haven't got to the serious 
          presents yet, Arnold. 

     A hush falls over the assembled guests. Arnold composes his 
     face into a solemn expression and looks down at the 
     cluttered table.
 
                    EDDIE
               (solemnly) 
          Well, in all seriousness, Arnold, 
          seriously, I don't know why you 
          picked me to be your best man, but I 
          am deeply honored. I guess it's 
          because we're both Dodger fans, and 
          I'm going to miss you at next 
          Tuesday's night game when the 
          Pittsburgh Pirates invade Ebbets 
          Field. We always had a lot of fun 
          together, and, seriously, Arnold, 
          in all seriousness, good luck on 
          your wedding, but see if you can't 
          get out of the house occasionally, 
          see a night game or even a Sunday 
          doubleheader with your old buddy, 
          Eddie.
 
     This touching address has brought a note of sadness to the 
     gathering. Indeed, there are tears in Walter's and Arnold's 
     eyes.
 
                    EDDIE
               (handing Arnold 
               two neatly wrapped 
               packages) 
          Well, anyway, in all seriousness, 
          here are a couple of presents from 
          all of us in the office and good 
          luck. 

     Arnold takes the presents, stands, head bowed. Eddie sits 
     and all faces turn to Arnold.
 
                    ARNOLD
          Well, I just want to thank you 
          fellows. I don't know what to say. 
          I just want to thank you.
 
                    KENNETH
          Open the presents, Arnold.
 
                    ARNOLD
          I will. I just want to say, Eddie, 
          that when the Pirates invade Ebbets 
          Field next Tuesday night, I'm going 
          to be sitting right there in Section 
          37 there right with you.
 
                    EDDIE
          You'll be on your honeymoon next 
          Tuesday, Arnold. 

     This interesting information gives Arnold pause.
 
                    ARNOLD
          Gee, that's right. 

                    CHARLIE
               (smiling) 
          Arnold, you're getting married 
          Sunday, did you forget?
 
                    WALTER
          Look at him blush.
 
                    ARNOLD
               (frowning fuzzily) 
          No, I didn't forget. It's just that 
          ... Gee, that's right. Sunday. 
          What's today, Thursday? 

                    KENNETH and EDDIE 
          All day!
 
                    ARNOLD
          Boy, it's here, isn't it? I guess 
          I've been running around so much the 
          last couple of weeks, I guess the 
          wedding snuck up on me.
 
                    KENNETH
          I think Arnold's having a little 
          buck fever. Does anyone know what 
          our waiter looks like?
 
                    EDDIE
               (to Kenneth) 
          You know who didn't want to chip in 
          for Arnold's presents? ... 

                    CHARLIE
          Arnold'll be all right. Have a drink, 
          Arnold.
 
                    WALTER
          I had my basic training in Camp Croft, 
          South Carolina, near Spartanburg.
 
                    EDDIE
          I was at Maxwell Field, what a 
          desert.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Walter, what ever happened when you 
          and that tech sergeant from the
          motor pool got loaded on vanilla 
          extract?
 
                    WALTER
          What tech sergeant?
 
                    CHARLIE
          Walter, you're crocked. 
               (to Arnold) 
          Open up the presents -- see what you 
          got.
 
                    KENNETH
          Hey, are you our waiter? Bring us 
          some ice. I got him -- I got our 
          waiter!
 
                    ARNOLD
          It was sure nice of you fellows.
 
     The voices have risen again into the jumbled high spirits 
     that opened the scene.
 
                    EDDIE
          Hey, man, we're having a ball!
 
                              DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
     EXTERIOR. EIGHTH STREET -- NIGHT
     We look down on Eighth Street in Greenwich Village. It is 
     eight thirty at night. It is a fairly active and well-lit 
     street, bright with neons and movie marquees and lit-up 
     shops. Our five carousers are marching down the sidewalk, 
     that is four of them are on the sidewalk. Walter can't quite 
     decide whether he wants to walk on the sidewalk or in the 
     street. He keeps hopping in and out between the parked cars, 
     running to catch up when he falls behind. They are all 
     feeling pretty good. Arnold is singing in a wavering 
     baritone:
 
                    ARNOLD
          De-Witt C-l-i-n-t-o-n
          Boom! 
          Clinton!
          Oh, Cli-inton! 
          Ever to theeeee!
 
     CLOSER SHOT of the five carousers.

                    ARNOLD
               (singing) 
          Fairest of high schools ...
 
                    EDDIE
          How did he ever get on this alma 
          mater kick?
 
                    ARNOLD
               (singing) 
          ... Give her three times three 
          Oh, fellows ...
          Rah! Rah! Rah!
 
     ANOTHER SHOT of the five carousers, Walter whistling at two 
     passing girls.
 
                    ARNOLD
          Long may we cherish thee 
          Faithful we'll be. 
          Clinton, oh, Clinton 
          For you and me ... 
          Da-da-da-da-da ...
          Crash through that line of blue 
          And send the backs around the end.
 
                    EDDIE
          There he goes with those fullbacks 
          again.
 
                    ARNOLD
          Rah! Rah! Rah!
 
                              DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
     EXTERIOR. GREENWICH AVENUE AND TENTH STREET -- NIGHT
 
     GROUP SHOT of our five carousers paused on the curb, waiting 
     for the lights to change in their favor. Greenwich Avenue 
     traffic is pretty heavy, going in both directions. The five 
     men are kind of strung out along the curb with Charlie being 
     the last in line. Standing beside him, also waiting for the 
     light to change, is a good-looking, well-dressed, chic young 
     woman of twenty-four or five.
 
                    KENNETH
          Where we going? Eddie's place to 
          see movies?
 
                    ARNOLD
          What movies?
 
                    EDDIE
          Boy, just wait till you see these 
          movies! Hey, Charlie, hey Charlie ...
 
                    CHARLIE
          What?
 
                    EDDIE
               (indicating the 
               young woman) 
          Who's your beautiful friend, Charlie?
 
     Charlie turns and regards the pretty young woman.
 
                    CHARLIE
               (to the girl) 
          Excuse me. My friend down there 
          wants to know who you are.
 
     The young woman, who for our own mysterious purposes we shall 
     refer to as The Existentialist, regards the five reasonably 
     tight young men all staring at her. Kenneth has already begun 
     to giggle.
 
                    THE EXISTENTIALIST
               (with a Mona Lisa smile) 
          Where are you all from, out-of-town?
 
                    CHARLIE
          Indiana.
               (turning to 
               the others) 
          Isn't that right, fellers? We're 
          from Indiana, right?
 
                    EDDIE
          Indiana! Indiana, man!

     Kenneth and Arnold, to whom this incident is already 
     unbearably funny, have turned away and are clutching their 
     sides, trying to suppress a fit of giggles.
 
                    CHARLIE
               (to The Existentialist) 
          We're from the Hoosier State, ma'am...
 
                    WALTER
          Terre Haute! We're from Terre Haute!
 
                    CHARLIE
               (to The Existentialist) 
          We're from Terre Haute, and we've 
          come to the big city looking for a 
          good time, and we just don't know 
          what to do with ourselves, ma'am.
 
                    EDDIE
               (to Walter) 
          Look at that Charlie operate.
 
                    THE EXISTENTIALIST
          Must be a convention in town.
 
                    CHARLIE
          We've just come off the ranch there, 
          honey, and we're just raring. Is 
          that right, men? Are we raring?
 
                    EDDIE
          We're raring, boy, we're raring!
 
                    KENNETH
               (beside himself 
               with laughter) 
          Hey, Charlie, cut it out, will you?
 
     The lights change and The Existentialist starts off across 
     Greenwich Avenue to the west side of the street. The five 
     carousers follow right along after her.  That is, Charlie 
     dogs along behind The Existentialist as they cross the 
     street. Walter and Eddie are close behind him, listening to 
     Charlie's pitch. Kenneth and Arnold, embarrassed and 
     giggling, stagger along behind. 
 
                    CHARLIE
               (chugging along behind 
               The Existentialist) 
          We're down here in Greenwich Village 
          looking for some wild bohemians. Do 
          you happen to know any wild 
          bohemians?
 
                    THE EXISTENTIALIST
          All right, fellows, enough's enough, 
          huh?
 
     She steps up to the sidewalk on the west side of Greenwich 
     Avenue and hurries along down Tenth Street to a little house 
     about four doors down, the five carousers on her heels like 
     a pack of puppies.
 
                    CHARLIE
               (hurrying along after 
               The Existentialist) 
          I'm something of a poet myself, 
          ma'am. Many's the long night in the
          bunkhouse where I sat by myself and 
          wrote by the flickering light of a 
          kerosene lamp. Could I read you some 
          of my poems, ma'am? I know they 
          ain't much, but they're from the 
          heart, ma'am. 

     The Existentialist pauses in her hurried walk down Tenth 
     Street to examine Charlie with some interest.
 
                    THE EXISTENTIALIST
          You have a sense of humor, don't you?
 
                    EDDIE
               (to Charlie) 
          You're going great, man, don't stop 
          now. 

     The Existentialist goes up the two little steps to the front 
     door of the house and rings the bell.
 
                    EDDIE
               (to The Existentialist) 
          Where are you going, honey? 

     The Existentialist waits composed and patient for someone to 
     answer her ring. Charlie has wandered back to Arnold and 
     Kenneth, and the three of them are now suffused with 
     laughter. Kenneth has been laughing so much, tears are 
     coming out of his eyes. He walks around in little circles 
     clutching his sides. Several passersby hurry by, noting the 
     strange little group on the sidewalk.
 
                    EDDIE
               (to The Existentialist) 
          What's going on in there, honey?
 
                    THE EXISTENTIALIST
                (patiently bored)
           There's a party going on. I'm not sure 
          I'm invited myself, so I can't really 
          invite you.
 
                    EDDIE
          Sure you can.
 
     The door opens and a woman in a tea gown stands there 
     looking at The Existentialist and then at the five men on 
     the sidewalk. Behind her, there is evidence of a party going 
     on.
 
                    THE HOSTESS
          How nice to see you, darling. Who 
          are your friends?
 
                    THE EXISTENTIALIST
          I haven't the vaguest idea. I was 
          ambushed crossing Greenwich Avenue 
          by a tribe of the Terre Haute 
          Kiwanis.
 
                    THE HOSTESS
               (she waves a vague 
               hand in a sort of 
               shooing motion at 
               the five men on 
               the sidewalk) 
          Go away, you men. Go back to the 
          Biltmore Hotel and put on your red 
          caps.
 
                    EDDIE
          I always thought you city people 
          were more hospitable to us poor 
          farm boys.
 
     The other four carousers are laughing too much to even talk. 
     Charlie has ambled up to The Existentialist, who is peering 
     over her hostess into the room behind her. 
 
                    CHARLIE
               (to The Existentialist,
               smiling amiably) 
          I'm sorry, miss. A friend of ours is 
          getting married here, and we're just 
          horsing around.
 
     The Existentialist looks into the young man's smiling, 
     rather winning face.
 
                    THE EXISTENTIALIST
          Why don't you come back after you 
          get rid of your friends.
 
                    EDDIE
          He'll be back!
 
     She turns abruptly and disappears past the hostess into the 
     room.
 
                    EDDIE
               (to Charlie) 
          Man, she likes you, man!
 
                    THE HOSTESS
          Now, you boys go away.
 
     She backs into her house and closes the door. Eddie starts 
     up the steps to the door. The other four just roar with 
     laughter, clutch their sides, and giggle and snort.
 
                    EDDIE
          Well, what do you say, men, are we 
          going to this party, or aren't we?
 
                    CHARLIE
               (laughing) 
          Come on, Eddie. I thought you had 
          some movies you want to show us.
 
                    EDDIE
          What do you want to see movies for? 
          You got the real thing right here.

                    CHARLIE
               (laughing) 
          Eddie, we're married men here.
 
                    EDDIE
          Come on, let's crash this party. 
          I've been to these Greenwich Village 
          parties. Man, they're wild.
 
                    KENNETH
          Come on, Eddie, let's go up to your 
          place, see these movies.

                    EDDIE
               (coming reluctantly 
               back to the others, 
               says to Charlie) 
          Man, you were going strong with that 
          girl. You could have scored. She's 
          just waiting for you. Go in after 
          her.
 
                    KENNETH
          Come on, Eddie. Let's go see the 
          movies.
 
                    EDDIE
               (to the others) 
          All right, I live about three blocks 
          down. You guys want to see movies, 
          all right, let's go see movies.
 
                              DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
     INTERIOR. THE BACHELOR'S APARTMENT
     Eddie is scowling over a home-style movie projector, 
     muttering over the intricacies of fitting a reel into the 
     ratchets. Arnold has suddenly become voluble and is gabbing 
     away at him. CAMERA DOLLIES AROUND THEM during the scene so 
     that we can see into the living room of the apartment, 
     appointed in simple but neat masculine taste, where the 
     other three men move in and out of view. Right now, we are 
     concerned only with Arnold and Eddie.
 
                    ARNOLD
          ... we're moving in with her mother 
          and father. I don't know if that's 
          such a good idea. What do you think? 
          We haven't got an apartment yet, and 
          we figure we'll live a year with her 
          folks, save on the rent, see? 

     Kenneth comes back from the kitchen with three open bottles 
     of beer.
 
                    KENNETH
          Anybody want a bottle of beer?
 
                    ARNOLD
               (to Eddie) 
          She's a widow, and that bothers me a 
          little. I don't know why. She's two 
          years older than me. I don't know if 
          you know that. Her husband got killed 
          in Korea. She's a cousin of mine, you 
          know.
 
                    KENNETH
               (moving into 
               the living room) 
          Who wants a bottle of beer?
 
                    CHARLIE
          I'll take a bottle.
 
                    WALTER
          Yeah, give me one.
 
                    ARNOLD
          A third cousin, something like that. 
          It's not good for cousins to marry, 
          is it? What do you think of her? I 
          know she's not terribly pretty, but 
          I mean ...
 
                    EDDIE
               (muttering imprecations 
               at the projector) 
          Arnold, leave me alone a minute, 
          will you?
 
                    ARNOLD
          Sure.
               (turns to the others in 
               living room, plants a 
               huge smile on his face) 
          Well, I'm getting married Sunday. 
 
                    KENNETH
          Having fun, Walter?
 
                    WALTER
          Fun. A bunch of grown men sitting 
          around waiting to look at college 
          boy pictures.
 
                    ARNOLD
          I swear, I never thought two months 
          ago I was ever going to get married. 
          I still don't know how it happened....
 
                    EDDIE
          Hey, somebody turn off the lights. 

     Walter is promptly up to turn off the lights.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Hey, you know, you've got a nice 
          place here. 

     The room is abruptly flooded in darkness. A beam of light 
     shoots out from the projector. It seems pointed at the 
     window. Arnold stands up directly in the shaft of light.
 
                    ARNOLD
          I was just taking her out. I didn't 
          know it was so serious.

                    EDDIE
          Arnold, get out of the way, will 
          you?
 
                    ARNOLD
          Oh, sure.
 
     Arnold moves a step, still in the shaft of light, his shadow 
     huge on the wall. Eddie, muttering, jockeys the projector 
     around trying to focus it on the screen. The square of light 
     and some flickering images wander up and down a wall.
 
                    ARNOLD
          ... We're sitting in the car, so she 
          says: "Well, Arnold, we've been 
          going together six months now. I 
          think it's time we decided whether 
          we were being serious." 

                    WALTER
          Hey, Eddie, you got it on the window.
 
                    ARNOLD
          I didn't know it was so serious. I 
          didn't even know we were going 
          together. I just took her out every 
          now and then.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Arnold, you're funny.
 
                    EDDIE
          Turn on the lights again, will you, 
          Walter.
 
                    WALTER
          What's the matter?
 
                    EDDIE
          I forgot to loop it over this loop 
          thing.
 
     Walter crosses to light switch. The room is flooded in light 
     again.

                    CHARLIE
          Oh, for crying out loud.
 
                    ARNOLD
               (small panic) 
          I can't even remember what she looks 
          like! I just saw her this afternoon!
 
                    KENNETH
          Arnold, have a bottle of beer. It's 
          not so terrible.
 
                    ARNOLD
          Boy, I tell you. It's for the rest 
          of your life when you get married. 
          This is a big decision to make.
 
                    WALTER
          Does anybody seriously want to see 
          these movies? 

     Eddie is furiously winding and unwinding spools. CAMERA HAS 
     DOLLIED AROUND so that we are looking back up the living 
     room toward the projector and the men.
 
                    ARNOLD
          I could be making a serious mistake.
 
                    EDDIE
          Arnold, you're in the way again. 
          Come on now. All right, put off the 
          lights.
 
     The room is flooded in darkness again. Walter hurries to a 
     chair. The square of light is reasonably focused, just an 
     edge trailing off onto the drapes of the window. Numbers 
     flicker quickly on on the screen. The rest of the scene we 
     see looking into the whitened faces of the five men at their 
     various posts. Arnold crosses, stands back of Walter.
 
                    KENNETH
          Here we go.
 
                    EDDIE
          Hey, Arnold, if this is the one I 
          think it is, there's one part here I 
          want you to see.
 
                    WALTER
               (a picture of determined 
               boredom, but putting on 
               his glasses) 
          This is for kids.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Says he -- putting on his glasses.
 
                    KENNETH
          "The Baseball Game." That's a nice 
          title, don't you think?
 
                    EDDIE
          This is the one, Arnold. There's a 
          guy in here who looks just like 
          Arnold.
 
                    KENNETH
          Hey, she's not bad. Usually, the 
          girls in these things look like 
          dinosaurs.
 
                    WALTER
               (his eyes glued 
               to the screen) 
          A bunch of grown men ...
 
     He breaks off as apparently some interesting action has 
     started on screen. An involuntary grunt of acknowledgment 
     escapes him.
 
                    EDDIE
          I got these pictures off my dentist. 
          I don't know where be got them. 
          There you are, Arnold, that's you.
 
                    CHARLIE  
          Yeah, it does look like Arnold.

                    EDDIE
          Doesn't that look like Arnold?
 
                    KENNETH
          Who's looking at the guy?
 
                    CHARLIE
          Arnold, you've got a great career 
          ahead of you.
 
                    KENNETH
          That girl looks like the girl 
          Charlie picked up just before.
 
                    EDDIE
          Probably is.
 
                    WALTER
          That fellow there is not a bad actor.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Actor. You could play that part 
          pretty easy yourself.
 
                    KENNETH
          I think the Daily News gave this one 
          four stars.

                    EDDIE
          I'd like to see this in Three-D.
 
     The side comments drift off for a moment, and a sort of 
     frozen attention settles on the white faces. Each face is 
     sort of set in a mold of determined disinterest, but the 
     eyes are all watching.
 
                    WALTER
          Well, I'll just watch one of them. 
          Then, I think I'll just go home.
 
     He wets his lips, lifts the bottle of beer to his mouth and 
     takes a swallow. His eyes never leave the screen.
 
                              DISSOLVE TO:


     INTERIOR. KITCHEN  CHARLIE AND HELEN'S APARTMENT
     Helen standing in front of the laundry part of the sink, 
     doing her private laundry. She has on a house smock and her 
     sleeves are rolled up. The doorbell rings. Helen takes a 
     towel off the doorknob behind her and, wiping her hands, 
     comes down across the dining area to the front door. She 
     opens the door to admit a young woman, about eight years 
     older than Helen.
 
                    HELEN
          Hiya, Julie. I was beginning to 
          think you weren't coming.
 
                    JULIE
               (coming in) 
          I was at my mother's house. Did they 
          call you? They said they were going 
          to call you.
 
                    HELEN
          Yeah, your mother was very sweet.
 
                    JULIE
          You should have seen my father. I 
          said, "Pa, you have another 
          grandchild coming." So he said, 
          "Who?" So I said, "Charlie." So he 
          said, "That little Helen?" So I said, 
          "If it isn't that little Helen, 
          Charlie better leave town." So out 
          came the beer. Well, they've been 
          after Charlie to have a baby for a 
          long time now. I said, "Pa, leave 
          him alone. Let him get established 
          before he saddles himself with a 
          baby." Anyway, I want you to know 
          joy reigns supreme in your in-laws' 
          house. 
               (she moves into 
               the kitchen) 
          How's Charlie taking it?
 
                    HELEN
               (following her 
               into the kitchen) 
          Listen, let me make you a cup of 
          tea or something.
 
                    JULIE
          No, no, I've been drinking beer for 
          the last two hours, celebrating your 
          baby.
 
                    HELEN
          Soda, anything like that?
 
                    JULIE
          No, honey, you go on with your wash. 
          Is that what you're doing? 
               (she sits) 
          When I had my first baby, Mike was 
          ashamed to be seen on the streets 
          with me. Well, listen, he was 
          interning at the time. We needed a 
          baby like a hole in the head. That's 
          why he's a general practitioner now, 
          because of that baby. He was 
          studying to be a surgeon. He 
          absolutely refused to admit I was 
          pregnant. Even in my ninth month, 
          and I was as big as a house. He 
          used to walk ten paces in front of 
          me in the street like he didn't 
          know who that woman with the belly 
          was. Where is Charlie anyway?
 
                    HELEN
          I told you he--
 
                    JULIE
          Oh, yeah. I wouldn't let my Mike go 
          on a bachelor party.
 
                    HELEN
               (turning back 
               to her wash) 
          What are they going to do, get a 
          little drunk?
 
                    JULIE
          Are you kidding? What do you think 
          these bachelor parties are for, 
          bachelors? This is for the married 
          men. It's a good excuse to get 
          drunk and find some girls. 

                    HELEN
          Can you picture Charlie getting 
          drunk and picking up a girl? 
          Charlie's old sobersides. You 
          should have seen what I went through 
          to get him to make a pass at me. 
          He's so sweet. Nobody knows how 
          really sweet he is, he's so quiet 
          all the time. My brother died in 
          September, he used to stay up with 
          me till three, four o'clock every 
          night. I used to cry all night, and 
          he used to sit on the bed and talk 
          with me. I used to look at him 
          talking there, and I used to think: 
          "What would I do without this sweet 
          man here? I'd go crazy." You know, 
          you like to be a little cynical 
          sometimes, Julie.
 
                    JULIE
          Wait'll you've been married eleven 
          years.
 
                    HELEN
          You like to talk about all the 
          affairs everybody's husband is 
          having. Do you know actually one 
          woman whose husband is actually 
          playing around?
 
     An abrupt, sad expression, tinged with pain, has come over 
     Julie's face. She looks down at the table.
 
                    JULIE
          Wait'll you've been married eleven 
          years.
 
     Helen, aware that she has perhaps touched on a sensitive 
     subject, frowns and turns back to her washing. A quick, 
     thick silence dips into the room. 
 
                    JULIE
               (looking down) 
          Wait'll Charlie gets to be forty-two. 
          My Mike's having an affair right now 
          with one of his patients right now. 
          We don't talk about it -- don't you, 
          either, not even to Charlie. But 
          Mike knows I know about it. I even 
          know the patient. A married woman 
          with a hyperthyroid problem. My 
          Mike's a good doctor with a pretty 
          good practice. The kids are crazy 
          about him. But every now and then 
          he has to go out and get involved 
          with a woman. 

     She looks down at her hands in her lap.
 
                    JULIE
          Listen, I will take a cup of tea if 
          you've got one. 

     She stands, opens the pantry, looks around among the cans 
     and packages for a box of tea bags.
 
                    HELEN
               (quite shocked) 
          You're kidding, aren't you?
 
                    JULIE
               (finds the box 
               of tea bags) 
          Would I kid about something like 
          that?
 
     She puts the box of tea bags an the workshelf, unhooks a 
     saucepan hanging over the stove, turns to the sink and fills 
     it with water. Helen regards her, not quite knowing what to 
     say. Julie sets the saucepan going on the stove, stares at 
     it.
 
                    JULIE
          I don't know why I told you. Don't 
          tell anybody, not even Charlie. I 
          don't want the family to know. But 
          this woman isn't the first one. I 
          know that much. About three years 
          ago, the doorbell rings. I open the 
          door. There's a man there. He says: 
          "Tell your husband to stay away from 
          my sister." How would you like to 
          open the door and have somebody say 
          that to you? I cried for two weeks. 
          I don't know what to do about it, 
          Helen. Should I bring it out in the 
          open with Mike or should I just keep 
          my mouth shut like the other time? 
          Because he's not going to leave me. 
          Even if he doesn't care about me, 
          he has his kids to think about. We 
          married too young. That was our big 
          mistake. We married too young. 

     Her face, her whole body suddenly tightens to forestall any 
     possibility of breaking into tears, and she sits down 
     abruptly on the kitchen stool, her eyes clenched tight and 
     her face rigidly impassive. Helen remains nervously silent.
 
                    JULIE
               (her voice rising just 
               a little from the 
               suppressed emotion 
               within her) 
          We should have waited till he 
          finished his internship. What kind 
          of married life is that? Twenty-two 
          dollars a month he was earning. 
          Every other day, he had to sleep in 
          the hospital. The first two years of 
          our marriage, we didn't even see 
          each other. And then I'm pregnant. 
          He had to quit, what do you think? 
          He wanted to be a surgeon, he wound 
          up being a G.P. From that day he 
          hated me. I had two other children 
          by him, but he hated me. He told me 
          in just so many words. Why do you 
          think I kept telling you, Helen, why 
          do you think I kept telling you: 
          "Don't have a baby till Charlie finds 
          himself." 
               (suddenly cries out) 
          It hurts! Even after eleven years, 
          it hurts!
 
     She stands abruptly and moves quickly past Helen out the 
     kitchen doorway into the dark living room, leaving Helen 
     standing troubled, concerned, in the kitchen. After a moment, 
     Helen moves to the kitchen doorway and a step out into the 
     dining area. She looks through the dark living room to the 
     gray silhouette of Julie standing by the living room window, 
     her form lightly outlined by a tracing of moonlight.
 
                    HELEN
          Are you all right, Julie?
 
                    JULIE
               (muttering) 
          I'm all right. I'm all right.
 
                              DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
     INTERIOR. BACHELOR'S APARTMENT (45 MINUTES LATER)
     We are looking back up the living room as we were at the 
     close of the last scene in this apartment. The room is 
     absolutely dark now, but a light pours in from the foyer. In 
     this shaft of light, we can see Eddie moving from behind the 
     projector to the wall switch and turning on the lights. The 
     room is abruptly bright with light, and our five men squint 
     against the sudden glare. They have all changed their 
     positions and taken off their jackets and loosened their 
     ties. They are lolling about. CAMERA LOOKS DOWN TO THE FLOOR 
     to take particular note of eight empty beer bottles, an 
     opened fifth of bourbon, ash trays, crumpled packs of 
     cigarettes, a cup and saucer, somebody's shoes, somebody's 
     jacket that has fallen off the back of a chair. Over this 
     we hear Walter's voice:

                    WALTER
          Is that the last one?
 
                    EDDIE
          Yeah.
 
     A thick silence fills the room. There is a kind of sodden 
     feeling to this scene. After a long moment, Walter's voice 
     again:
 
                    WALTER
          Ah, you've seen one, you've seen 
          them all. 
 
                    KENNETH
          Yeah, they're all alike.
 
                    CHARLIE
          I don't know -- I think the first 
          one was all right.
 
                    WALTER
          Yeah, I was so bored by the rest of 
          them. I nearly fell asleep during 
          the last one.
 
                    KENNETH
          You in the habit of sleeping with 
          your eyes open? 

     We look down on the room now, at all five of the men, Eddie 
     rewinding the last reel, the little motor of the projector 
     humming. The others loll about, their legs dangling over the 
     armrests of the soft chairs and sofas. There is a heavy, 
     dense mood that no one seems willing to break.
 
                    CHARLIE
          What time's it about, anybody know?
 
                    ARNOLD
               (glancing at his watch) 
          I got a quarter to nine.
 
                    EDDIE
          No, it's later than that, about a 
          quarter after. 

     Again the silence falls upon the five men. Only the humming 
     little motor interrupts the thick silence. Nobody moves.
 
                    WALTER
               (after a moment) 
          Ah, you see one, you've seen them 
          all.
 
     Again the silence. Charlie stretches over for his bottle of 
     beer on the floor beside his chair. He pours what's left of 
     the bottle into the glass standing beside it. Otherwise 
     nobody moves.

                    WALTER
               (after a moment) 
          So that's the last one you've got to 
          show us, Eddie?
 
                    EDDIE
          Yeah. You want to run them backwards?
 
                    KENNETH
          I wonder where they get the girls to 
          make these movies?
 
                    WALTER
          Might as well go home, I guess.
 
                    KENNETH
          Yeah.
 
     The idea doesn't seem to propel anybody to any decisive 
     movement. Walter shifts his position on the sofa, stretches 
     out his legs, regards his shoes with a sudden sadness.
 
                    WALTER
               (after a moment) 
          Life is short.
 
     This gives everybody something to think about for a moment.
 
                    EDDIE
               (hunched over 
               the projector, 
               dismantling it) 
          You guys feel like going down to 
          have a drink for Arnold?
 
     This brings a reaction. Walter stands.
 
                    WALTER
          Yeah! What do you say? One last 
          drink for Arnold!
 
                    CHARLIE
          Okay with me.
 
     Suddenly life is back in the room, the men ad-lib: "Where's 
     my coat?" "Let's get out of here," etc. 
 
                    KENNETH
               (unwinding himself 
               from his slouched 
               position on a chair) 
          You can say what you want to about 
          these pictures -- they're really 
          pretty bad -- but they get you.
 
                    ARNOLD
          Don't you think we ought to clean up 
          the place?
 
                    EDDIE
          No, I got a woman comes in.
 
                    WALTER
               (grabbing up 
               his jacket) 
          I almost fell asleep during the 
          last one. 
               (he looks at 
               the others) 
          Well, what do you say, huh? Let's 
          go! One last drink! 

     Ad libs on exit.
 
                              DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
     INTERIOR. LIVING ROOM CHARLIE AND HELEN'S APARTMENT
     Helen and Julie. A corner lamp in the living room is lit, 
     lending a soft but not too effective light to the room. The 
     two young women are on the couch. Helen sits curled at one 
     end, head down listening to Julie, who has been talking and 
     probably crying a little since we last saw them forty-five 
     minutes ago. Julie is seated with her legs stretched out in 
     front of her, her head resting back on the back of the couch. 
     She is talking more freely and easily now, the first hard 
     outburst over with.
 
                    JULIE
          ... He's a boy, my Mike. Till the 
          day he dies, he'll never be more 
          than fifteen. Perpetual adolescence, 
          that's the curse of the professional 
          man. He spends his whole youth trying 
          to be a doctor, a lawyer, an 
          accountant. Then he spends the rest 
          of his life looking for the fun he 
          should have had when he was a boy.
 
                    HELEN
          Oh, I know. Charlie and I hardly 
          even see each other.
 
                    JULIE
          It's very hard on the wife, Helen. 
          These are the years when you should 
          be building your marriage. Instead, 
          you grow away from each other. I've 
          seen it happen with my friends. In 
          the end, they have nice homes in New 
          Rochelle, and a maid, and their 
          maids are happier than they are. But 
          sometimes it does work. It can be 
          done, Helen. Encourage Charlie to 
          stay with his school because...
 
                    HELEN
          Oh, I will, Julie ...
 
                    JULIE
          ... he's an ambitious boy ...
 
                    HELEN
          ... oh, it's not just he's 
          ambitious ...
 
                    JULIE
          ... and if he doesn't fulfill 
          himself, he'll resent you and your 
          baby the rest of his life.
 
                    HELEN
          Oh, I don't want him to quit. He 
          loves accounting, Julie. I see him 
          sometimes, sitting over his homework. 
          He's got his ledgers out, and he's 
          adding up columns of figures as long 
          as his arm. And he's chuckling. 
          You'd think he was reading the 
          comics. He has a book there, 
          Business Law. How he can read it I 
          don't know. But I'll be watching 
          television or something, and he'll 
          come over, and he'll start telling 
          me about some fine legal point. I 
          don't know what he's talking about, 
          but it's enough for me to see how 
          excited it makes him. He loves it,
          Julie. You can't take something like 
          that away from him. It's just -- 
          it's just I feel we're not really 
          close any more. I mean, he comes 
          home from school, lots of times I'm 
          asleep already. And, when I do see 
          him, he seems all involved with 
          himself. He looks at me sometimes as 
          if I were a stranger to him, and I 
          feel sometimes I am. I'm afraid of 
          that, Julie.
 
                    JULIE
          Then get rid of the baby.
 
     It is said simply, inevitably, even innocently. It brings 
     only a frown to Helen's face and a short silence.
 
                    JULIE
          If I had it to do again, believe me, 
          that's what I would do.
 
                    HELEN
               (slowly becoming aware 
               of the depth of what 
               they are talking about) 
          You don't mean that, Julie.
 
                    JULIE
          Yes, I do. My children are the only 
          things in my life now, but I would 
          rather have a husband.
 
                    HELEN
          I wouldn't even think about it.
 
                    JULIE
          That's what I said, too.
 
                    HELEN
          Let's not even think about it. If I 
          even mentioned it, he'd -- he'd hit 
          me, I think.
 
                    JULIE
          All right.
 
     Now, the thick, tense silence falls between them. They both 
     occupy themselves with their own troubled thoughts. 
 
                    HELEN
          I want this baby, Julie. I've wanted 
          this baby for a long time. It's the 
          only thing I've ever asked of 
          Charlie. If I mentioned that to him 
          -- I don't know what he'd do. 

     Again, they sink into silence. Then in the thick silence, 
     the telephone rings. The two young women are so deep within 
     their thoughts that neither of them moves. It rings again, 
     and Helen slides off the couch and goes to the phone. It 
     rings again. She picks it up.
 
                    HELEN
               (on phone) 
          Hello.... Hello, Charlie, where are 
          you calling from? ... You sound like 
          you're having a nice time.... Oh, 
          you're having a ball, huh? ... Well, 
          what time do you think you'll be 
          coming home?
 
     INTERIOR. PHONE BOOTH IN EIGHTH STREET BAR
     Charlie in the phone booth, smiling broadly. He seems in 
     wonderful spirits. Through the glass of the phone booth we 
     can see part of the bar and some of the barflies.
 
                    CHARLIE
               (on phone) 
          Well, that's what I wanted to call 
          you about, honey. I think a couple 
          of the guys are cutting out now. I 
          think Kennie's going home. But I was 
          wondering if you wanted me home for 
          any special reason.
 
     INTERIOR. THE FOYER
 
                    HELEN
               (on phone) 
          Just a minute, Charlie....
 
     She rises, goes to kitchen door, still holding the phone. 
 
                    HELEN
               (to Julie) 
          Excuse me a minute, Julie. It's 
          Charlie.... 

     She goes into the kitchen. A little embarrassed, she closes 
     the kitchen door.
 
     INTERIOR. THE KITCHEN
 
                    HELEN
               (on phone) 
          Charlie? ... 
               (sits) 
          Charlie, come on home now.... No, I 
          feel all right. I just miss you. 
          Julie's here, and we were talking 
          about you, and I just miss you.... 
          Ah, come on.... 
               (frowns a little) 
          Well, no, if you're having such a 
          good time, stay out and enjoy 
          yourself.... No, Charlie, I don't 
          want you to come home if you're 
          having a good time.... I'm not 
          lonely. Julie's here. We're talking. 
          I was washing some things.... I 
          know, that's what I told you this 
          morning. You've finally got a night 
          off for yourself. I don't want you 
          to feel guilty about it.... 
          Charlie, do you love me? ... You 
          sound angry.... No, come home any 
          time you want....
               (she wets her 
               lips nervously) 
          Charlie ...
               (she lets her head 
               sink down onto the 
               palm of her free hand) 
          Charlie, there's no girls at this 
          party, are there? ... I'm not 
          checking up on you, Charlie. I just 
          miss you, that's all.... All right, 
          Charlie, please, I don't want to 
          argue with you. Julie's in the 
          living room. ... All right, have a 
          good time, stay out as long as you 
          want.... All right, Charlie, good-
          bye.
 
     She slowly hangs up the receiver, sits slumped and abject.
 

     INTERIOR. PHONE BOOTH IN EIGHTH STREET BAR
     Charlie in booth. The broad grin has disappeared from his 
     face. As seen through the closed glass doors of the booth, 
     he is a very sullen and despondent young man. He stands now, 
     pushes the doors open, and comes out. CAMERA PULLS BACK so 
     that we can see the whole area of the bar near the phone 
     booths. Next to the phone booth are two doors marked GUYS 
     and DOLLS. Kenneth is coming in from the deeper recesses of 
     the bar where the other members of the bachelor party are 
     grouped in a booth. He is headed for the door marked GUYS. 
     Charlie regards Kenneth bleakly as he approaches.
 
                    CHARLIE
          The party breaking up?
 
                    KENNETH
               (pushing into 
               the men's room) 
          I don't know. I'm going home. You 
          going home?
 
                    CHARLIE
          Yeah, I think so.
   
     He pushes into the men's room after Kenneth.
 
     INTERIOR. THE MEN'S ROOM 
     A small, white-tiled, yet somehow not too clean, men's room, 
     two-urinal size. There is one washbowl with a small mirror 
     over it, and two water closets with doors, separated from 
     each other by a steel partition. Charlie perches on the edge 
     of the washbowl; he apparently came in just to talk. Kenneth 
     moves off camera for more practical use of the room. CAMERA 
     stays on Charlie who seems depressed, pensive, sad. Stay on 
     him for a long moment. Then ...
 
                    CHARLIE
               (frowning) 
          You love your wife, Kennie?
 
                    KENNETH'S VOICE 
               (off)
          Well, I've been married six years. 
          I've got two kids that keep me awake 
          all night long. Every Sunday, we go 
          out driving in Long Island looking 
          for a house that's going to take 
          one, probably two mortgages. I better 
          love my wife.
 
     Kenneth appears now, edges Charlie away from the wash basin, 
     so he can wash his hands.
 
                    CHARLIE
          I don't feel like going home. Are 
          you going? Hang around, Kennie. It's 
          only about nine thirty, ten.
 
                    KENNETH
          It's after ten. It's about ten after 
          ten.
 
     Kenneth rips off a paper towel. The only noise for a moment 
     is the soft crumpling of paper as Kenneth dries his hands.
 
                    KENNETH
          The party's getting a little wild in 
          there anyway. Eddie and Walter got 
          poor Arnold nailed in there, they're 
          trying to talk him into getting a 
          girl. This party's going to wind up 
          in a joint, let me tell you. This is 
          a good time to blow.
 
                    CHARLIE
               (frowning)
          Yeah.... I should have gone to class 
          tonight. I'm paying twenty bucks a 
          credit. The least I can do is go to 
          class.
 
     He breaks off abruptly, turning away with a sudden frown.
 
                    CHARLIE
          I take one night off, I can't even 
          enjoy myself. Did you know Eddie 
          went back to Europe? 
 
                    KENNETH
          No, I didn't know that.
 
                    CHARLIE
          He was telling me he lived in Paris 
          for three months. I'd like to do 
          that! 

     He ambles around the men's room, studying himself with 
     unseeing eyes in the little mirror, poking the trash can 
     into which Kenneth is now dropping his wadded paper towel. 
     He suddenly turns to Kenneth, stares at him. Kenneth looks 
     at him in mirror.
 
                    KENNETH
          What's the matter?
 
                    CHARLIE
          I'm going to quit. What am I 
          killing myself for?
 
                    KENNETH
          Quit what?
 
                    CHARLIE
          Quit night school. Tonight was the 
          first laughs I've had in years. I 
          can't remember the last time I had 
          so much fun. Look what I'm missing. 
          I'm making a pretty good living. I 
          can support a wife and baby on what 
          I make. I'm going to quit! I mean 
          it. I'm going to quit. Boy, what a 
          time to have a baby.
 
                    KENNETH
          You don't have to quit school 
          because you're having a baby, 
          Charlie. There are lots of guys go 
          to night school with two, three 
          kids.
 
                    CHARLIE
          You ought to meet some of these guys. 
          They're just grinding their lives 
          away. It's an obsession with some of 
          these guys. I mean, what's the point? 
          So I'll go five more years to night 
          school. So I'll get my degree. So 
          I'll get a job as a junior accountant 
          for three years at seventy-five bucks 
          a week. I'm making better than that 
          now. And then it just starts. The 
          CPA exams. By the time I'm fifty, I 
          can start living. At this point, I 
          get a heart attack and an ulcer, and 
          they bury me in the ground, and they 
          say: "That was Charlie Samson, the 
          man who didn't see a movie in fifty 
          years." Why go through all that? 
          I'll quit. I feel so mad right now, 
          you better keep an eye on me, Kennie, 
          because I'm going to wind up punching 
          somebody.

     The door opens. Man enters to clean a spot off his tie.
 
                    KENNETH
          Come on, let's go home.
 
                    CHARLIE
          What do I want to go home for?
 
                    KENNETH
          You're in a lousy mood.
   
     The man, finished with his tie, exits.
 
                    KENNETH
               (after a moment) 
          Charlie, go home. I can see you're 
          going to get fried tonight and wind 
          up picking up a tramp and you're 
          going to wake up in the morning 
          feeling like two-bits.
 
                    CHARLIE
          It'd be a profit.
 
                    KENNETH
          Charlie, about five years ago, I 
          went without a job for seven months. 
          Alice was carrying our first baby. 
          We were living on money I borrowed 
          from my brother. I don't know if you 
          remember me in those days, but it 
          was rough. I used to go out every 
          night, put a load on, and make a 
          pass at any girl who looked at me. 
          And I mean any. Big, tall, short, 
          fat, anything. Well, one night I 
          picked up some tomato somewheres, 
          and we were sitting in a bar or 
          somewheres, and I kept calling her 
          Alice all night. So she says to me: 
          "My name ain't Alice. Who's Alice?" 
          So I said: "Alice is my wife," and 
          I got up and I went home.
 
     Charlie waits a moment for Kenneth to continue, but 
     apparently this is all Kenneth has to offer at the moment.
 
                    CHARLIE
          What does that mean?
 
                    KENNETH
          I don't know. I had a point when I 
          started telling that story.
 
                    CHARLIE
          I'm not looking for another woman.
 
                    KENNETH
          Yes, you are, Charlie. You may not 
          know it, but you are. So go on home, 
          Charlie, before you get any drunker 
          than you are. Charlie, you start 
          messing with other women, something 
          goes. It'll kill your marriage. 
          It'll kill your wife. It'll just 
          kill her. What my wife went through 
          -- well, I don't even want to 
          remember it. It's never the same 
          with your wife again, Charlie.
 
                    CHARLIE
          I'm not looking for any woman.
 
                    KENNETH
          I think what I was trying to say 
          was you stick with your night school. 
          Some guys have to make peace with 
          themselves that they're never going 
          to amount to too much. A guy like me. 
          Once I made that peace with myself, 
          I found out it doesn't really matter 
          what you amount to. I got a nice 
          wife and two children I complain 
          about all the time, but if anything 
          ever happened to either one of them, 
          I think I'd die. But you don't have 
          to make that kind of peace, and 
          you'd be crazy to settle for less 
          than what you want. You want 
          something, Charlie. I think that's 
          wonderful.
               (Charlie's eyes go 
               toward Kenneth) 
          You're a little drunk now, and 
          you're fed up to the teeth. 
          Everybody gets fed up, Charlie. You 
          stick with it. You're going to be all 
          right.
 
                    CHARLIE
               (touched) 
          You're a nice guy, Kennie.
 
                    KENNETH
          Sure. You're a nice guy too.
 
     The door to the men's room opens, and a Young Man comes in, 
     looks around quickly at Kenneth and Charlie -- bumps into 
     Kennie.
 
                    YOUNG MAN
          Watch it -- will you, Mac?
 
     Charlie regards this statement a moment. Then advances to 
     the Young Man.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Wait a minute.... What are you, a 
          wise guy? 

     He is all set to bust the Young Man one in the nose, but 
     Kenneth takes him by the arm.
 
                    KENNETH
          Come on, Charlie, let's go home. 

     Charlie allows himself to be led to the door.
 
                    CHARLIE
          I'm just about drunk enough right 
          now to bust somebody right in the 
          nose.
 
     Kenneth reaches for the knob of the door, opens it, and the 
     two men go out. They find themselves in the crowded, noisy 
     bar. A jagged kind of intensity to the atmosphere as if some 
     of the men at the bar might be gangsters. Booths filled with 
     men and women and some mixed-up types. Kenneth and Charlie 
     make their way through the bodies down to one of the booths 
     where Eddie and Arnold are sitting and Walter is standing, 
     heavily drunk. Eddie is expostulating to Walter:
 
                    EDDIE
               (to Walter) 
          ... Come on, will you? Look Walter, 
          it's just the shank of the evening! 
          What's so special in your home? You 
          got a floor show every night? Who 
          are you married to, Jayne Mansfield? 
          Come on, it's not even half past 
          ten!
 
     Walter sits heavily down.
 
                    KENNETH
               (smiling amiably) 
          We got to get up tomorrow, go to 
          work, Eddie.
 
                    EDDIE
          We're just starting! We got to get 
          Arnold a girl yet!
 
                    ARNOLD
          Eddie, please ...
 
                    EDDIE
          That's the whole point to a bachelor 
          party! You got to get the guy a girl!
 
                    ARNOLD
          Look, fellows, it's been a nice 
          clean party ...
 
                    KENNETH
          Well, Arnold, since I'm not going to 
          see you again before the wedding, 
          congratulations and best wishes in 
          the coming future to both you and 
          the bride.
 
                    ARNOLD
          Thanks a lot, Kennie....
 
     Eddie turns to Charlie, who is still glowering.
 
                    EDDIE
          You're not going, are you, Charlie? 
          We're just starting! We got to get 
          Arnold a girl yet! 

                    ARNOLD
               (to Kenneth) 
          I want to thank you for the 
          presents, Kennie....
 
                    CHARLIE
          ...No, I'll stick around another 
          hour or so....
 
                    EDDIE
          ... That's my boy....
 
                    ARNOLD
               (to Kenneth, who is 
               looking at Charlie) 
          ... Honestly, I never expected any 
          presents....
 
                    KENNETH
               (to Charlie) 
          ... Aren't you coming home? ...
 
                    CHARLIE
          ... What for? Sit around talking to 
          my sister Julie? ...
 
                    ARNOLD
               (standing) 
          ... I want to thank all you 
          fellows ...
 
                    EDDIE
          All right, stop thanking them, 
          Arnold. They just gave you a party, 
          they didn't elect you President.
 
                    ARNOLD
          ... This has been one of the nicest 
          nights of my life....
 
                    CHARLIE
          Let's go someplace ... let's go to 
          a nightclub.
 
                    EDDIE
          That's great with me.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Come on, Ken.
 
                    ARNOLD
          Thanks a lot.
 
                    KENNETH
          ... Well, listen, fellows, I'm 
          cutting out.... Good night, Walter, 
          Eddie. 
               (to Charlie) 
          ... You coming, Charlie? ...
 
                    CHARLIE
          ... No, I'll kill another hour.... 
          Come on, Kennie....
 
                    KENNETH
          No, you go ahead. I'll see you in 
          the morning, Charlie.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Okay, I'll see you.
 
                              DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
     EXTERIOR. THIRD STREET 
     The little stretch of strip-joints on Third Street. Bright 
     little cluster of honky-tonks.
 
     EXTERIOR. THIRD STREET
     Our bachelor party, now down to four carousers, ambles along 
     the rather filled sidewalk, looking at the cardboard cutouts 
     of the strippers in the windows of the night clubs.
 
     The four men pause before one of the strip-joints, examining 
     the cardboard cutout and billboard which promises first-rate 
     entertainment inside.
 
                              DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
     INTERIOR. THIRD STREET NIGHT CLUB 
     We look down on the whole night club, showing the dark, 
     dingy, crowded, smallness of it. There is a strip going on. 
     It doesn't look very interesting. 

     Our four men are huddled over a very small table in one of 
     those Third Street clip-joints. It is a dark little hovel, 
     but a blue stage light drifts across the table, vaguely 
     illuminating our four celebrators. Behind them, a strip 
     tease is in progress. Every now and then, an almost stout 
     woman in her forties, garish in the blue spotlight, dressed 
     in a white satin ill-fitting gown, moves in and out of our 
     view. Half the tables and wall booths are occupied. There is 
     a horseshoe bar off in the recesses of the club. A three-
     piece band is playing spiritlessly.
 
     Walter is gone, deep in some painful, drunken world of his 
     own. Charlie rubs his eyes as if to keep his senses awake. 
     Arnold, who is soggy, is leaning toward Eddie, who alone of 
     the four men is giving any attention to the show.
 
                    ARNOLD
          So what do you think of my girl, 
          Eddie? You met her. Be honest with 
          me. Tell me the truth. I had the 
          feeling you didn't like her.
 
                    EDDIE
          Come on, come on, Arnold. What do 
          you want from me. 

     Arnold turns to Charlie.
 
                    ARNOLD
          Listen, Charlie, I'd like to ask you 
          a little advice. I mean, you're a 
          married man. This girl, I'm supposed 
          to marry, she's all right, but I'm 
          not really attracted to her, you 
          know what I mean? That's important,
          isn't it? I kissed her a couple of 
          times, but I ... I don't know why 
          I'm getting married, Charlie.
 
                    CHARLIE
          What did you say, Arnold?
 
                    ARNOLD
          I said, I don't know why I'm getting 
          married. I did pretty good for 
          thirty-two years without getting 
          married. I get along fine at home. 
          My mother's a good cook. I have a 
          nice life. What do I want to break 
          it all up for?
 
                    CHARLIE
          Well, Arnold, everybody feels that 
          way before they get married.
 
                    ARNOLD
          Yeah? Did I ever show you a picture 
          of my girl?
 
                    CHARLIE
          No, you didn't, Arnold.
 
                    ARNOLD
          Do you want to see a picture?
 
                    CHARLIE
          Sure.
 
     Arnold clumsily hauls out his wallet and extracts a picture. 
     He gives it to Charlie who twists at an angle in order to 
     get some light on it.
 
                    ARNOLD
          I want you to give me your honest 
          impression, Charlie. She isn't much, 
          is she?
 
                    CHARLIE
          I can't see much in this light, but 
          she looks like a nice pretty girl.
 
                    ARNOLD
          Well, I wouldn't say that. We were 
          matched up, you know. The families 
          kind of agreed on it. I was brought 
          over to her by my mother and father. 
          That's how I met her. She's some 
          kind of tenth cousin. She's all 
          right. She's quiet. I kissed her a 
          couple of times. She just sat there 
          and I kissed her. I think she 
          expected more. She even asked me 
          that. She said to me: "Are you 
          afraid of me?" I really don't go out 
          with women much. You know. Don't 
          tell nobody this, Charlie, but you 
          aren't going to believe this, but I 
          never ... I mean, you wouldn't 
          believe that a guy of my age, I 
          never ... Don't tell anybody I ever 
          told you this, but I never-- I mean, 
          Charlie, she's a widow. She's been 
          married already -- she's going to 
          expect a lot -- and I never ---- 
          What do you think I ought to do?
 
                    CHARLIE
          What do you mean, Arnold?
 
                    ARNOLD
          I mean, you think I ought to marry 
          her?
 
                    CHARLIE
          Well, Arnold, even if I knew the 
          girl, I wouldn't answer that 
          question. I may not like her, but 
          she may be fine for you.
 
                    ARNOLD
          Because I'm thinking of calling the 
          whole thing off.
 
                    CHARLIE
          It's kind of late for that, isn't 
          it?
 
                    ARNOLD
          I'm scared stiff, Charlie.
 
                    CHARLIE
          What are you scared about?
 
                    ARNOLD
          I'm not much of a talker, and she's 
          one of those quiet ones. What are 
          you supposed to do with your wife? 
          I mean, most of the time.
 
                    CHARLIE
               (has to think) 
          Most of the time, Arnold, you don't 
          even see her. You're away working. 
          You come home, she fixes you supper. 
          Then one of you washes the dishes. 
          Then if you're not tired, you can go 
          to the movies or visit somebody. Or 
          you watch teevee.
 
                    ARNOLD
          I do that now with my mother. 

     This gives Charlie pause.
 
                    CHARLIE
               (scowling) 
          I don't know what there is to 
          marriage. I suppose it's to have 
          kids.
 
                    ARNOLD
          So what do you think I ought to do? 
          You think I ought to go through with 
          this marriage?
 
                    CHARLIE
               (angry) 
          Arnold, I can't answer that! 

     He stands abruptly.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

  
     EXTERIOR. STREET -- NIGHT
     Our four amble along Washington Square North, headed west. 
     In the background, the high apartment houses. It is about 
     midnight now, and there are a number of people around, and 
     there are lots of lights in the windows. There is still the 
     feeling of life. However, some of the wind has gone out of 
     our bachelor party since we last saw them carousing on 
     Lexington Avenue. Now, of course, there are only four of 
     them, and there is somewhat a feeling of straggling about 
     them.
 
     EXTERIOR. STREET -- NIGHT
     The four men straggle along Tenth Street east of Seventh 
     Avenue. This is a dark little street. Off at the 
     intersection, you can see Seventh Avenue and an occasional 
     car moving downtown, but West Tenth Street right now seems 
     an empty, sleeping street of dark and old little apartment 
     houses. The houses sometimes have little stoops. On one of 
     the stoops, there is a woman sitting. She is in her thirties, 
     not attractive nor unattractive. She wears a light summer 
     frock, and she has one shoe off, and she is toying with the 
     idea of pushing the other one off too. As the four men 
     approach her, she looks up, half quizzically, half 
     questioningly. The four men note her in passing and seem to 
     continue on, but then come to a dragging halt about ten 
     paces down.
 
     CLOSE GROUP SHOT OF THE FOUR MEN.
 
                    EDDIE
          I think we've got one for you, 
          Arnold.
 
                    ARNOLD
          One what?
 
     Eddie looks back to the woman on the stoop. They all turn to 
     look. Actually, Charlie has ambled a few paces even further 
     down and doesn't know quite why they've stopped. They look 
     at the woman; the woman looks at them a little warily. Rest 
     of the scene from her point of view.
 
                    ARNOLD
          Ah, come on, Eddie.
 
                    EDDIE
          She ain't bad.
 
                    CHARLIE
               (calling from a 
               few paces down) 
          What's the matter?
 
                    EDDIE
          We've got a live one.
 
                    ARNOLD
               (starting to walk) 
          Come on, let's go.

                    EDDIE
          Arnold, for Pete's sake.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Ah, leave him alone! He doesn't want 
          to.
 
                    EDDIE
          Come on. We've been walking around 
          all night here -- are you a man, or 
          ain't you? 

     Arnold frowns.
 
                    ARNOLD
          All right, all right.
 
     With a scowl, he assumes the responsibility of being a man. 
     The four men, Charlie bringing up the rear, move down toward 
     The Woman, who now looks down at her feet and begins wiggling 
     her bare foot back into the unused shoe.
 
                    THE WOMAN
               (not looking up) 
          I don't know who you fellows think 
          I am, but you fellows have the 
          wrong idea about me.
 
                    EDDIE
          Yeah, I know. Arnold, see that bar 
          down the corner. That's where we'll 
          be.
 
                    THE WOMAN 
          I'm afraid you fellows have the 
          wrong idea about me.

                    ARNOLD
          She says we have the wrong idea.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Ah, leave him alone.

                    THE WOMAN 
          You fellows are working under a 
          misconception. 

     Eddie and Walter have already started down the street to 
     the bar.
 
                    EDDIE
          We'll be in the bar, Arnold.
 
                    CHARLIE
          You all right, Arnold?
 
                    ARNOLD
          Yeah, I'm all right, it's just ...
 
                    THE WOMAN 
          Look, I'm just sitting here, fellows. 
          Did I say anything? I was just 
          sitting here.
 
                    ARNOLD
          You want to come with me, Charlie?
 
                    CHARLIE
          No, Arnold.
 
     Charlie scowls at the suggestion, but there is something 
     pleading in Arnold's face.
 
                    CHARLIE
          You want me to? All right. I'll go 
          up with you.
 
                    EDDIE
               (from halfway down 
               the street) 
          Where you going, Charlie?
 
                    CHARLIE
          I'll go up with him. Moral support.
 
                    EDDIE
          What the---- we'll all go with you. 

     Charlie waves him away.

                    EDDIE
               (walks back to fellows) 
          We'll be down at the bar.
 
     Charlie nods. Arnold looks briefly at The Woman and then 
     away again.
 
     She turns and goes up the steps into the building, her 
     leather heels clicking on the stone steps. Arnold, head 
     down, and Charlie, a little sheepishly, follow her.
 
     INTERIOR. THE HOUSE
     A dark, ill-lit hallway. A flight of stairs going up, wooden 
     railings, worn carpeting. The Woman starts up the stairs, 
     the two men following her.
 
                    THE WOMAN 
               (as she goes) 
          Ssshhh....
 
     Arnold, wetting his lips, nods. The Woman reaches the first 
     landing.
 
     INTERIOR. LANDING
     The Woman has come around to one of the three doors on the 
     landing and is inserting a key into a lock. Arnold and 
     Charlie appear now at the head of the stairway. The Woman 
     goes into her room, leaving the door open. A moment later, 
     a shaft of light streams out into the landing. For a moment, 
     nothing happens. Then Arnold and Charlie amble slowly down 
     the landing to the open doorway and shaft of light.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Hey, Arnold, you don't have to go 
          through with this.
 
                    ARNOLD
          I think I should.
 
                    CHARLIE
          I'll wait out here for you, okay?
 
     Arnold nods and goes into the room. He closes the door. 
     Charlie takes out a cigarette and lights it and inhales 
     deeply. He feels a little sordid. There is the sound of 
     steps, muffled by the carpeting, coming down the stairs. A 
     man appears coming down from the floor above. He gives 
     Charlie a quick look and continues on down the landing to 
     the stairs and down again. Charlie scowls at the floor. He 
     smokes his cigarette.
 
     INTERIOR. THE WOMAN'S ROOM
     It is a furnished room for which the woman pays eleven 
     dollars a week. It is not particularly unkempt or tarty. 
     There is a print slipcover on the soft chair and flowers on 
     an end table. There is a studio couch with a neat spread and 
     throw pillows on it. The Woman stands expressionlessly in 
     front of the old chest of drawers. She has kicked off one 
     shoe and she is now kicking off the other. She starts to say 
     something:
 
                    THE WOMAN
          Listen, I don't want you to think I 
          don't have a job. I got a job. I 
          work.
 
     She stops abruptly as Arnold, who is sitting, eyes averted, 
     on a straight-back wooden chair, suddenly stands up and 
     moves toward the door.
 
                    THE WOMAN
          What's the matter?
 
     Arnold's lips open to form words, but nothing comes out, and 
     he clamps his mouth tight and just stands, miserable and 
     wretched. His hand makes a nervous, spasmodic, involuntary 
     gesture, and he quickly clenches his fist. Beads of sweat 
     are on his forehead. 
 
                    THE WOMAN
          Are you afraid of me?
 
     Arnold's head has started to shake nervously, and he opens 
     the door and steps out into the landing. The Woman, 
     beginning to get angry, follows him.
 
     INTERIOR. LANDING
     Charlie looks up at the opening of the door and Arnold's 
     entrance. The Woman stands in the doorway. Arnold moves 
     quickly past Charlie about halfway down the landing, white-
     faced and trembling.
 
                    THE WOMAN
               (getting a 
               little shrill) 
          What's the matter? Hey. Hey, you. 
          Hey, you, what's the matter?
 
                    CHARLIE
          Let's go.
               (to The Woman) 
          What's the trouble?
 
                    THE WOMAN
          I don't know. Ask him. What's the 
          matter? Hey, you. You, what's the 
          matter?
 
                    CHARLIE
          Go back inside.... All right, all 
          right.
 
                    THE WOMAN
          How about that, huh?
 
     She turns angrily, goes back into her room (ad libbing as 
     she crosses) and slams the door. Charlie moves down the 
     landing to Arnold, who looks at him wide-eyed, almost in 
     terror.
 
                    CHARLIE
          What happened, Arnold?
 
                    ARNOLD
          I don't know. I'm just scared.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Yeah, I don't blame you, I'd be 
          scared too like this. I don't know 
          why we dragged you up here in the 
          first place. It's a barbaric custom. 
          Come on.
 
     He has taken Arnold's arm and would lead him down the 
     stairs, but Arnold pauses again at the first step.
 
                    ARNOLD
          Don't tell Eddie.
 
                    CHARLIE
          No I won't, Arnold.
 
                    ARNOLD
          Why don't we just sit here for ten
          minutes or so? 

     Charlie frowns, then shrugs.
 
                    CHARLIE
          All right, Arnold.
 
     They both sit slowly on the steps. Arnold is still trembling 
     from the whole terrifying experience.
 
                    ARNOLD
          Don't ever tell anybody.
 
                    CHARLIE
          It's nothing to be ashamed of.
 
                    ARNOLD
          Please, Charlie.
 
                    CHARLIE
          I won't tell anybody.
 
     A man's voice suddenly calls down from an upper floor.
 
                    MAN'S VOICE
          Anything wrong down there? 
 
                    CHARLIE
               (calling back) 
          No. No. Nothing wrong.
 
     Charlie sits. CAMERA MOVES UP CLOSER to both men. The whole 
     experience has depressed Charlie, and it shows on his face.
 
     CAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK so that we get the small, sordid 
     feeling of the two men, somewhat tight, sitting on a dirty 
     ill-lit staircase outside a whore's bedroom.
 

     INTERIOR. CORNER BAR
     Neighborhood bar with about ten people in it. Eddie and 
     Walter are two of them. Eddie is playing on one of those 
     bowling machines. He seems surly, ill-tempered, restless.
 
                    EDDIE
          Hey Walter -- you know what we 
          ought to do, don't you? We ought to 
          go to that party. Remember that girl 
          Charlie picked up on Tenth Street?
 
     Walter, who is so drunk he is sober, looks up at Eddie with 
     blurred eyes.
 
                    WALTER
          I'm going to die, do you know that?
 
                    EDDIE
          Not tonight, Walter. Tonight you're 
          going to live. Ah, these things are 
          fixed. 
               (crosses to bar) 
          I'm down to my last buck. Got any 
          money on you? 

     He turns as the door to the bar opens and Charlie and Arnold 
     come in.
 
                    EDDIE
               (to Charlie) 
          Hey! 
               (to Arnold) 
          How'd it go, lover?
               (Arnold smiles a 
               mysterious smile, 
               pregnant with 
               sensual meaning) 
          Hey, Charlie, let's go to this party. 
          It's only twelve o'clock. Oh, these 
          parties are mad, man. All the women 
          wear pajamas, and all the men wear 
          beards. Everybody sits on the floor. 
          Arnold, you got any money? I spent 
          my last buck on those drinks. How 
          about you, Charlie?
 
                    ARNOLD
               (assessing his assets) 
          I got a little over a buck.
 
                    EDDIE
          What are we, all out? So let's go to 
          this party then. 
               (punches Charlie's arm) 
          Hey, Charlie, come on.
 
                    CHARLIE
               (himself sullen and angry)
          Cut it out.
 
                    EDDIE
          You can have that girl you picked up 
          on Tenth Street. Come on.... All 
          right, you married men want to be so 
          married that's all right with me. 
          But I'd like to see some women 
          tonight.
               (punching Charlie's 
               arm with more hostility 
               than he knows) 
          Come on.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Lay off.
 
                    EDDIE
          I'd like to see some women tonight, 
          you know. Do you mind?
 
                    CHARLIE
          Cut it out, Eddie. You keep punching 
          me, I swear I'm going to belt you 
          one.
 
                    EDDIE
          What's the matter with you?
 
     Charlie is off his seat and ready to belt Eddie one right on 
     the spot. There is abruptly the imminent reality of a fist 
     fight. The two men are just sullen enough. Arnold hurriedly 
     intercedes.
 
                    ARNOLD
          All right, all right, fellows.
 
                    EDDIE
          Look, don't get so tough with me, 
          Charlie.
 
                    ARNOLD
          All right, all right, come on.
 
                    CHARLIE
               (angry)
          I don't want to see any other women!
 
                    EDDIE
               (just as angry) 
          All right! Go on home! Who's holding 
          you?! You want to call it a night? 
          Because I'm tired of grousing from 
          one bar to another. You guys go home, 
          and I'll go about my merry way. All 
          right? And don't get so tough with 
          me.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Well, don't poke me.
 
                    ARNOLD
               (turning Charlie 
               back to his seat) 
          Come on, let's go ... gee ...
 
     For a moment, the sudden, thick hostility fills the silence 
     in the room. Nobody says anything. Walter is soddenly 
     preoccupied with his own thoughts. Arnold is shaken from his 
     recent experience with The Woman and from the flaring of 
     tempers. Charlie just sits bleakly examining a book of 
     matches he is toying with, trying to bring his temper down. 
     After a moment, he mutters:
 
                    CHARLIE
               (mutters)
          You mess around with other women, it 
          kills your wife and it kills your 
          marriage.
 
     Eddie suddenly, sulkily strides for the door of the bar.
 
                    EDDIE
          All right, you guys go home, and 
          I'll go on my merry way. 
               (gets to the door, 
               pauses, then turns, 
               his sudden hot temper 
               gone as quickly as 
               it had come) 
          Hey, you guys, you guys want to go 
          to a nutty night club, look at the 
          nuts? There's a nutty night club 
          over on Second Avenue. You know 
          what we can do? Charlie, you live in 
          Stuyvesant Town, don't you?
 
                    CHARLIE
          Yeah.
 
                    EDDIE
          You know what we can do? We'll take 
          the crosstown. We'll go over to 
          Charlie's house, he'll get some 
          money, and we'll go to this nutty 
          night club. It's right down on 
          Second Avenue. You got any money 
          home, Charlie?
 
                    CHARLIE
          What do you say, Arnold? You want to 
          go? 

     Arnold shrugs. Eddie has started for the door already. 
     Charlie wearily gets off his stool, starts to follow Eddie 
     out. Walter takes his arm.
 
                    EDDIE
          Charlie, get Walter.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Come on, Walter....
 
     CLOSEUP of Walter
 
                    WALTER
          I'm going to die, you know what I 
          mean? 

     The sad little party files wearily out of the bar, Arnold 
     pausing at the bar to pay for the drinks.
 
                              DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
     INTERIOR. FOURTEENTH STREET CROSSTOWN SUBWAY
 
     LONG SHOT looking down through the length of one almost 
     empty car, through the open door at the end of the car, 
     down into the next almost empty car. Just a few people 
     riding the subway at this hour, half past eleven on a 
     week-day. But down in the second car, we can see our four 
     cavaliers. Eddie, Arnold, and Charlie are sitting. Our 
     attention is most caught by Walter, who is heavily drunk and 
     weaves and lurches up and down the central aisle of the car. 
     We cannot hear if he is saying anything.
 
     CLOSE SHOT Walter weaving up and down the aisle of the car. 
     He stumbles on the toes of a man in a windbreaker, sitting 
     in the car.
 
                    WALTER
               (mumbling) 
          Excuse me ... excuse me ...
               (turns his blurred 
               attention to Charlie, 
               who, alone of the 
               three, seems painfully 
               interested in what 
               Walter is talking 
               about) 
          So what'll I do? I mean, he says, 
          I'm going to die. I mean, the man's 
          a specialist. He says: "Go to 
          Arizona, go to Colorado," he says. 
          "You got to get out of New York or 
          you're going to die." He tells my 
          wife, the stupid idiot. My wife 
          cried all night. I'm going to die, 
          you know that? You understand that? 
          I'm going to die? You know what an 
          asthma attack is like? Your heart 
          starts beating like a drum! I passed 
          out the last time!
 
                    CHARLIE
               (deeply compassionate) 
          Walter, why don't you just quit the 
          job and pack your bags and get out 
          of here?
 
     Walter stands in front of Charlie, his lips moving, but no 
     words coming out for a moment. There are tears in his eyes, 
     and all the pain and anguish of the man's forty-eight years 
     are clear on his face.
 
                    WALTER
               (getting the words out) 
          I can't quit. Don't you understand? 
          You don't understand. I can't quit! 
          I got a fourteen-year-old girl, I 
          don't know what time she comes in at 
          night any more. She's so wild, these 
          kids. I got a nineteen-year-old boy 
          in college; he's going to be a 
          doctor if I have to die. He's not 
          going to quit school. You hear me! 
          I worked hard to put that kid in 
          school! I don't care if I die! I 
          don't care! What am I going to do 
          in Arizona? Who wants me? Who's 
          going to give me a job? What kind 
          of a job am I going to get? I'm 
          forty-eight years old. They don't 
          want no forty-eight-year-old 
          bookkeeper. They got machines from 
          IBM. You ever been up on the ninth 
          floor? You ever see all those IBM 
          machines? What am I going to do out 
          in Arizona? You look in the Help 
          Wanted lately? You see any jobs 
          listed for Bookkeeper, Male? What 
          are you talking about? Do you know 
          what you're talking about?
 
     Charlie reaches up to steady Walter, who has worked himself 
     up into a lurching fury.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Easy, Walter.
 
                    WALTER
               (flinging Charlie's 
               hand aside) 
          Take your hand off me. You don't 
          know nothing! You're just a kid! 
          You don't know! I've seen death, 
          kid. I've seen it, boy. I know what 
          it looks like.
               (he staggers away a 
               few paces down the 
               aisle, stumbles over 
               the man's toe again) 
          Excuse me.... Forty-eight years old 
          and so what? What does it mean? What
          happened? What have I got? What did 
          I make? Who needs me? So this is it. 
          A man's life, nothing. Worry about 
          being sick, worry about making money, 
          worry about your wife, worry about 
          your kids, and you're on your way to 
          the grave from the day you're born. 
          The days drag on, and the years fly 
          by, and so what?
               (cries out to 
               the whole world) 
          What is it all about? Will you tell 
          me? 

     The train is slowing up for a station now.
 
                    WALTER
          Life is nothing! It's a gag! It's a 
          joke! It's a mortgage! It's a 
          bankrupt! It's a lot of noise over 
          nothing! Sound and fury! Isn't that 
          what the man said? What do you 
          think, I never read a book? I read a 
          book! Don't worry! I was a bright 
          kid! Everybody thought I was going 
          to be the first Catholic to be 
          President! Where did it all go?! 

     He turns to look at the station they are edging into, the 
     yellow lights, the dark shadows, the few blurred faces. His 
     face is wet with the tiny rivulets left by tears. 
 
                    WALTER
               (mumbling)
          Where did it all go? 

     The train stops, the green doors slide open.
 
                    EDDIE
               (looking out, 
               in a low voice) 
          Where are we, Third Avenue?
 
                    ARNOLD
               (low voice) 
          Where are we getting off? Next stop?
 
                    CHARLIE
               (low voice)
          Yeah.
 
     A few people come into the car. Walter stands, shoulders 
     hunched and sagging, in front of the open doors.
 
                    WALTER
               (muttering) 
          I'm going home.
 
                    CHARLIE
               (looking up) 
          What did you say, Walter?
 
                    WALTER
          I'm going home.
 
     Walter steps out onto the platform. Just in time, because 
     the doors are beginning to slide closed again.
 
                    CHARLIE
               (standing) 
          Walter, where are you going? Come 
          here ... 

     On the platform, Walter has started to weave slowly up the 
     platform toward the stairway.
 
                    EDDIE
               (standing) 
          What, did Walter get out?

                    CHARLIE
               (calling through 
               the open window) 
          Walter, stay there, we'll come back 
          on the next train. Stay there.
 
     But Walter has already reached the stairway and, clinging to 
     the handrail, has started slowly climbing the steps. The 
     train starts slowly up. Arnold has stood now too. He is 
     pretty soggy himself.
 
                    ARNOLD
          Poor Walter, huh?
 
                    CHARLIE
               (bellowing through 
               the window) 
          Walter! ...
 
                    EDDIE
               (standing) 
          He'll be all right, Charlie. God 
          protects drunks and fools.
 
     The train is sweeping by the stairway now. Charlie bellows 
     out:
 
                    CHARLIE
          Walter! Grab a cab if you're going 
          home! 

     The train has swept by, and in a moment they have been 
     plunged into the tunnel of the subway, the bleak dirty white 
     walls, and the small yellow lights flashing by. Charlie sits 
     down, somehow greatly shaken and disturbed.
 
                    EDDIE
               (sits)
          Poor Walter, I didn't know he was so 
          sick. I thought there was something 
          wrong with him, though. He's been 
          out so much.
 
                    ARNOLD
               (sitting drunkenly down) 
          I didn't know he was so sick. 

     CLOSE IN on Charlie.

                    CHARLIE
          That's me in fifteen years.
 
     CLOSEUP of Charlie. Hold for a moment.
 
                              DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
     EXTERIOR. FOURTEENTH STREET AND FIRST AVENUE
     We look down at the subway kiosk as our sad little party of 
     three comes up the stairs to the sidewalk. It is midnight, 
     and the street is occasionally patrolled by a taxicab. The 
     sidewalks are pretty empty, just a few people walking. 
     Perhaps a drugstore is still open, and its lonely lit store 
     front catches the eye.
 
     Our three men stand at the head of the stairs at the subway 
     kiosk, drained, tired, a little despondent. Charlie looks up 
     at the dim silhouettes of the endless apartment houses of 
     Stuyvesant Town.
 
                    CHARLIE
          That's where I live.
 
                    EDDIE
          Which one?
 
                    CHARLIE
          In the back there. You can't see it 
          from here. 

     LONG SHOT of Stuyvesant Town as seen from their point of 
     view. PAN SLOWLY ACROSS, capturing the silent monotony of 
     the dark buildings. Only a few of the windows are still lit.
 
                    EDDIE
          It looks like a state hospital.
 
                    CHARLIE
          It looks like a prison.
 
                    EDDIE
          Yeah, it does look a little like a 
          prison. 

     The three men just stand, worn out, tired.
 
                    CHARLIE
               (suddenly) 
          I'm going home.
 
     He starts to walk to the buildings, across the little street 
     that separates the corner of Fourteenth Street and First 
     Avenue from the parallel corner of the housing project.
 
                    EDDIE
               (calling after him) 
          Hey, Charlie ... 

     Charlie turns.
 
                    EDDIE
          Hey, Charlie! What about the money? 
          Have you got ten bucks?
 
                    CHARLIE
               (after a moment) 
          All right, if you want to walk me to 
          the house, I'll get you ten bucks.
 
     Eddie has to take a moment to consider this. Then he 
     shuffles across the little street toward Charlie. Charlie 
     doesn't quite wait for him to catch up when he turns and 
     leads the way between two cars and up the sidewalk toward 
     the promenade that leads to the heart of the project. 
     Arnold, after a moment, follows Eddie. The three men 
     disappear single-file into the darkness of Stuyvesant Town.
 
                              DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
     INTERIOR. LANDING OUTSIDE CHARLIE'S APARTMENT
     We are looking at the twin elevator doors. The light of an 
     elevator climbs into the little square window of one of the 
     elevator doors. The door opens, and Charlie, Eddie, and 
     Arnold shuffle out into the landing. They are all a little 
     soggy.
 
                    CHARLIE
               (mutters) 
          I'll be right out.
 
     He moves around the turn of the wall, fishes in his pocket 
     for the key to his apartment. He finds it, brings it out, 
     opens the door carefully, goes into his apartment.
 
     INTERIOR. CHARLIE AND HELEN'S APARTMENT
     Charlie comes in. The dining area is lit, and there is the 
     lamp lit in the living room. As Charlie moves to the living 
     room, we can see that Helen is seated on the couch, 
     watching television. The gray-white light of the television 
     set drifts out into the room. Helen is in her pajamas and 
     she has washed for bed; her face is devoid of make-up. She 
     is half-watching television; the rest of her attention is 
     devoted to cutting her fingernails and other aspects of 
     manicure. She looks up as Charlie comes into the living 
     room, smiles.
 
                    HELEN
          Hiya, have a nice time?
 
     Charlie shrugs. He is depressed and can't conceal it.
 
                    CHARLIE
          I'm taking ten bucks. A couple of 
          the guys are waiting outside. I 
          promised them I'd loan them ten 
          bucks.
 
                    HELEN
          Sure.
 
     He stands by the couch now, without interest, automatically 
     watching the television set.
 
                    CHARLIE
               (looking at the set)
          Tomorrow's payday. I'll get it back 
          tomorrow. 
 
                    HELEN
          It's in the drawer.
 
     A kind of ennui has engulfed him. He stands, watching the 
     television set out of which is now pouring the end of an 
     animated cartoon commercial. Then the familiar tinkling 
     music sets in, the inscription, "The Late Show" appears on 
     the screen, and the announcer's voice informs us that we are 
     now going back to the late show, starring Rex Harrison in 
     "Strictly Dishonorable." The whole thing brings a wince of 
     pain to Charlie's face, and he turns and moves wearily 
     through the little foyer into the darkened bedroom. Enough 
     light flows in from the other rooms to show Charlie going to 
     the drawer in the chest of drawers and taking out a 
     ten-dollar bill. He returns the other bills, closes the 
     drawer and just stands there, suddenly so weak and exhausted 
     that he has to steady himself with one hand on the chest of 
     drawers.
 
     Back in the living room, Helen still sits, a slight frown 
     now indicating she is sensitive to the deeply depressed mood 
     her husband is in. She continues with her nails for a moment. 
     Then, wondering what is keeping her husband, she stands and 
     goes to the bedroom doorway and looks in.
 
     INTERIOR. THE BEDROOM
     Charlie is seated on the bed, hunched, in deep depression. 
     He is holding the ten-dollar bill. His eyes are open, but 
     there is a feeling of hurt and pain on his face. Helen moves 
     quietly into the bedroom and sits down on the bed beside him.
 
                    HELEN
          What's the matter, Charlie? 


     He shrugs, even smiles briefly. 
 
                    CHARLIE
          I don't know.
 
     She puts out her hand as if to take his head and press it 
     against her, but he takes her in his arms almost desperately, 
     and they lie back on the bed, clutching each other, their 
     faces pressed against each other, seeking some kind of
     strength just from the sheer physical closeness of each 
     other.
 
                    HELEN
          It's not so bad, Charlie.
 
                    CHARLIE
          I know. I know.
 
     They lie quietly, even stiffly, holding each other.
 
                    CHARLIE
               (eyes wide open 
               but unseeing) 
          I don't know what's the matter with 
          me, I keep getting so depressed. I'm 
          going to quit night school, Helen. 
          My nerves are shot.
 
     He releases himself from his wife's embrace and sits up.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Those guys are waiting outside. I 
          better give them their money.
 
     He stands and starts out the bedroom.
 
                    HELEN
          Charlie ... Maybe I shouldn't have 
          the baby?
 
                    CHARLIE
          What do you mean? ...
 
     She doesn't answer. She doesn't have to. They both know what 
     she means.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Isn't that dangerous? ... Well, I 
          don't know ... maybe ... Well, you 
          brought it up. 

                    HELEN
               (shocked -- after 
               a moment) 
          You really don't want this baby....
 
     She turns away on the bed to hide the sudden flush of tears.
 
                    HELEN
          You're my husband, Charlie. This is 
          your baby too. That doesn't mean 
          anything to you. For the first time 
          in our marriage I feel I can't 
          depend on you, Charlie -- I'm not 
          important to you.
               (she has to stop 
               because she can no 
               longer trust her 
               voice. After a 
               moment she continues) 
          I could make my life sound hard, too, 
          Charlie. I work all day, I rush home, 
          I make you dinner. I sit home alone 
          four nights a week, I'm even alone 
          when you're here because when do I 
          see you? But it was easy for me 
          because I loved you. Do you think I 
          care whether you're an accountant or 
          a ditch digger, or even out of work? 
          All I ever wanted was you. And this 
          baby because it's you, too.
 
     She closes her eyes again to hide the warm flow of tears in 
     her eyes and stops talking rather than cry. Charlie sits, 
     unmoved and wretched, his shoulders hunched, his head 
     slumped forward. After a moment, he turns and reaches 
     forward, quite frightened, to touch her arm.
 
                    HELEN
               (dully) 
          Leave me alone, Charlie.
 
     He stands and goes to the bedroom window and looks out. 
     Helen turns on her side so that her back is to him. At the 
     sound of her moving, Charlie turns his head, but sensing the 
     rejection in her back, he turns back and looks out the 
     window again. The silence is thick between them.
 
                    CHARLIE
               (looking out 
               the window) 
          I decided I'd quit school and ...
 
                    HELEN
          I don't care ...
 
                    CHARLIE
          I decided I'd quit school and come 
          home in the evenings like everybody 
          else and live a normal life.
 
                    HELEN
               (staring at the 
               wall ahead of her) 
          I don't care what you do, Charlie. 

     He stands another moment.
 
                    CHARLIE
          I don't care what I do either.
 
     Helen neither moves nor makes a response. Charlie goes on 
     into the living room and shuffles to the front door, his 
     long body heavy with pain and guilt and dense, unknown 
     terrors. He opens the door and goes out onto the landing.
 
     INTERIOR. LANDING
     Eddie and Arnold, looking up as the door opens and Charlie 
     comes out.
 
                    EDDIE
          What took you so long? What did you 
          do, blow open the safe?
 
                    CHARLIE
               (giving Eddie the 
               ten-dollar bill) 
          Here.

               (taking it)
          I'll give it to you tomorrow. I'll 
          see you in the morning, Charlie.

                    CHARLIE
          I'll see you.
 
     Eddie takes Arnold's arm and guides him back around the turn 
     of the wall to the elevators. Charlie follows a few paces 
     behind. Eddie pushes both elevator buttons. Charlie nods, 
     looks down at the tiling at his feet, fairly sick within 
     himself, oppressed and guilty. The light in the elevator 
     window shows, and Eddie opens the door.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Wait a minute. I'll go with you.
 
                    EDDIE
          Let's go to that party -- we'll 
          have a ball!
 
     Charlie shuffles the few paces forward and follows Eddie and 
     Arnold into the elevator. The door closes, and, a moment 
     later, the light of the elevator cage disappears downward.
 
                              DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
     INTERIOR. GREENWICH VILLAGE DUPLEX APARTMENT
     This is one of those duplex apartments on West Tenth Street 
     which consists of one huge living room that is two stories 
     high and you need a little rolling stepladder to reach the 
     books on the upper shelves of the built-in bookcases. There 
     is a little wrought-iron stairway that leads to the second 
     floor, which consists of two tiny little bedrooms. 

     Apartments like these, as is the case in this one, are 
     usually lived in by two girls, one of whom is a secretary in 
     an advertising agency and the other a model for a garment 
     manufacturing firm. Both girls are in their early thirties 
     and are milling about somewhere in the mass of people in the 
     living room, carrying drinks, laughing up a storm, pausing 
     at the little knots of discussion groups with an apt phrase. 
     They rather think of themselves as Madame de Staëls with 
     their own salon of bright young people, for most of the men 
     and women at the party are in some way connected with the 
     arts, probably in an avant garde way. It is a little 
     difficult to tell this by looking at them because avant 
     garde artists have become obsessed with dressing like 
     businessmen, but if you can hear the talk as we can, you get 
     the point fast enough. We pick up phrases like: "I really 
     find it difficult to think of Tennessee Williams as a 
     serious artist," or "My teacher thinks all tenors are frogs 
     except Gigli," or "I don't see how you can say that; his 
     designs fairly throb with sex." There are, as Eddie 
     predicted, a number of people sitting on the floor, mostly 
     girls, circled in the swirl of their Ann Fogarty dresses, 
     and there is one obvious ballerina, with her black hair 
     pulled tightly back into a severe pony tail, using the 
     wrought-iron railing that separates the dropped living room 
     from the small entrance foyer to demonstrate something about 
     positions at the dancing bar. There is someone at the piano 
     banging away, shouting his songs, but he is completely 
     inaudible five feet away. A few people lean over the piano, 
     apparently exhilarated by the songs. Thin blankets of smoke 
     wreathe their way up to the two-story-high ceiling. We catch 
     some more phrases: "I thought Truman Capote was supposed to 
     be here." -- "Truman's in Russia, I think." -- "Good 
     heavens, what can the Russians want with Truman Capote?" -- 
     "Oh, I never read anything published in this country." "Oh, 
     I mean, the paper-bound Paris edition." In short, this is a 
     real chi-chi wingding where all the furniture is too low, 
     and the hostess is very proud of the fact that her end table 
     is made out of an orange crate.

     Somewhere, through the jumble of the party, we can hear the 
     doorbell chime. A young woman, at one of the little knots of 
     people, perks her ears and says: 

                    HOSTESS
          I'm sure that's the police again.
 
     She's very proud of this. She turns and weaves her way 
     through the crowded room, carrying her drink. She goes up 
     the step to the entrance foyer, turns to her left, picks her 
     way over two middle-aged men who are both throwing a pitch 
     at a fairly tight girl of eighteen, past the kitchen, which 
     is a bedlam of ice cubes and kitchen towels and which is 
     occupied at the moment by two intense women in their late 
     thirties wrapped in deep discussion, up past two young men 
     who have no immediate use for girls, to the front door of 
     the apartment. She opens the door.
 
     GROUP SHOT of Eddie, Arnold, and Charlie from the Hostess's 
     point of view. Not exactly a heartening sight to most 
     hostesses, three fairly loaded young men with their collars 
     unbuttoned and their ties limp and dangling.
 
                    HOSTESS
               (beaming) 
          Are you coming to complain about the 
          noise?
 
                    EDDIE
          Do we look like complainers?
 
                    HOSTESS 
          I don't know who you are, but come 
          in, come in. I don't know half the 
          people who are here tonight. 

     They enter a little warily and ill-at-ease, peering into the 
     jammed room.
 
                    HOSTESS
          The police have been here twice. The 
          first fellow was just adorable. We 
          gave him a drink, and he's upstairs 
          in a bedroom now, for all I know.
 
                    EDDIE
          Is that right?

                    HOSTESS
          If you want something to drink, 
          you'll just have to go into the 
          kitchen and get it yourself. The 
          place is just mad. Do you write, 
          paint or sing?
 
     Eddie spreads his arms in all-inclusive expansiveness.
 
                    EDDIE
          Everything.
 
     But the hostess has already bent to chat with two women, one 
     old, one young, sitting on the floor. Our three cavaliers 
     look at each other and then look out over the wild, jumbled 
     room.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Boy, do you get invited to a party 
          like this or do you get committed?
 
     A passing young man who overhears this, pokes his head into 
     the group and says to Charlie with a flashing smile:
 
                    YOUNG CHAP
          I heard that. It's awfully funny. 

     Charlie regards the smiling young chap.
 
                    EDDIE
          Beat it.
 
     The chap's smile flashes off and he scurries away. Eddie 
     rubs his palms and surveys the women in the crowded room 
     with a measuring eye.
 
                    EDDIE
          This is going to be like shooting 
          ducks. Pick out your duck, men.
 
     Wetting his lips, he starts out for some girl he has decided 
     on across the room.
 
     INTERIOR. GREENWICH VILLAGE APARTMENT -- HALF HOUR LATER 

     HIGH SHOT showing progress of party, still crowded, still 
     high. If we look sharp we can see Charlie seated on the 
     floor in the rear of the shot, his back against the wall.
 
     CLOSER SHOT of Charlie sitting morosely, back against the 
     wall, regarding his drink with sodden eyes. The chatter of 
     the party, an occasional shrill laugh.

     FULL SHOT of Eddie coming out of the kitchen, carrying two 
     drinks. He picks his way through the people to the living 
     room with the general intention of getting to the 
     arrangement of divans around the coffee table, when he spots 
     Charlie and moves across to him.
 
                    EDDIE
          Hey, what's the matter, Charlie? 
               (squats down 
               beside Charlie)
 
                    CHARLIE
               (without looking up) 
          Let's get out of here, Eddie.
 
                    EDDIE
          The last time I saw you, you was 
          with that girl you picked up. What 
          happened?
 
                    CHARLIE
          She's over there talking to that 
          old guy with the glasses. 

     Their point of view, The Existentialist on steps with 
     landlord.
 
                    CHARLIE
          I didn't like her. She's one of 
          these real Greenwich Village phonies. 
          If I added up all the guys she told 
          me about, she must have had her 
          first boy friend when she was two 
          years old. Where are you going, 
          Eddie. Stick around a minute.
 
                    EDDIE
               (who has stood) 
          I'm with that one over there -- not 
          bad, huh? I think she's a Communist. 
          I think she's trying to talk me into 
          joining the Party.
 
                    CHARLIE
          How are you making out?
 
                    EDDIE
          Not so hot. I may have to join.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Hang around. Let's talk a bit.
 
                    EDDIE
          I better get back. She's liable to 
          recruit somebody else.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Where's Arnold?
 
                    EDDIE
          He's in the kitchen. I think he's 
          out cold. I'll see you. 

     Charlie nods as Eddie moves off. He returns his morose 
     attention back to his glass of liquor. Then his eyes close, 
     and his face, though impassive, shows pain. After a moment, 
     he opens his eyes and slowly clambers to his feet and makes 
     his way, a little unsteadily, through the living room in the 
     direction of the kitchen. In the background we can hear the 
     piano and somebody singing indistinguishable lyrics. Charlie 
     gets to the kitchen door and looks in. Arnold is at the tiny 
     kitchen table, head on the table, out cold. The kitchen is 
     in a state of havoc.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Hey Arnold-- You okay, Arnold? 

     Arnold makes no answer. Charlie regards his prostrated 
     friend expressionlessly for a moment. Then turns and 
     shuffles aimlessly back to the group around the piano in the 
     living room. He looks over to the stairway again. The 
     Existentialist is alone now, The Landlord having gone for 
     the moment. She is looking at Charlie, and he drops his eyes. 
     He turns away from the piano and moves out a few steps into 
     the middle of the living room. He moves to the stairway. 
     The Existentialist looks up at him as he approaches, Charlie 
     kind of nods to her, and, for a moment, she just sits and he 
     just stands. Then ...
 
                    THE EXISTENTIALIST
          That old man I was talking to before? 
          That's my landlord. About ten thirty 
          last night, someone began pounding on 
          my door. So I got up and opened the 
          door, and there was this white-haired 
          man with  a pince-nez standing there. 
          I said: "What do you want?" So he 
          said: "I'm the landlord, and I want 
          the rent." Well, I just looked at him 
          because the landlord I knew was a 
          Hungarian man named Frank, who was 
          crazy about me, and the issue of rent 
          never came up, you see. Well, it 
          turned out that this man with the 
          pince-nez had just bought the 
          building the day before and he kept 
          grabbing my arm and saying he wanted 
          the rent. Well, then I got the point, 
          of course. Well, meanwhile, a boy 
          named Bob I knew had come over. He's 
          engaged to a Javanese girl with 
          wonderful planes in her face who 
          lives at the International House. 
          But he's crazy about me and he drops 
          in about twice a week. Well, 
          meanwhile, my new landlord was 
          grabbing my arm and kept quoting 
          poetry to me which he was trying to 
          pass off as his own. He was an 
          absolute fraud. He scotched the 
          whole thing from Baudelaire. "Tu 
          mettrais." You know that one. Well, 
          he kept screaming about the rent -- 
          I didn't like him, you know -- and I 
          called this boy named George who 
          used to live in Poughkeepsie when I 
          was going to Vassar, and he's crazy 
          about me. He lives in St. Luke's 
          place now, but he goes to 
          Poughkeepsie every Wednesday to see 
          his mother, he's got an Oedipus, so 
          that was out. Well, my new landlord 
          kept telling me how much he was in 
          love with me. I said: "How 
          existentialist can you get? You just 
          met me five minutes ago." He was 
          absolutely crazy about me.
 
     Charlie has been sort of half-listening to all this. His 
     attention, if any at all, has been vaguely given to the 
     girl's bare arms, the lines of her body. 

                    CHARLIE
               (resigned) 
          You have an apartment around here 
          somewheres? 
               (looks up to 
               second floor) 
          What's up there? What kind of rooms 
          are up there?
 
                    THE EXISTENTIALIST
          So, I finally got to sleep around 
          six thirty.... 

     Charlie bends down to her, takes her arm.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Come on, let's go. 

                    THE EXISTENTIALIST
               (wrenching her 
               arm away) 
          No! Oh, stop trying to be so 
          primitive. 

     Charlie straightens with an irritated sigh.
 
                    THE EXISTENTIALIST
          I find you very unpleasant. 

     He stands, she sits in sullen silence.
 
                    THE EXISTENTIALIST
          There's nothing upstairs. 
               (suddenly rises, 
               mumbles) 
          Oh, I don't care.
 
     She starts up the stairs, Charlie following close behind her. 
     They pick their way past the other people sitting on the 
     stairs to the second-floor landing. They walk in hostile 
     silence down the landing to the bedroom door, which she 
     opens.
 
     INTERIOR. THE BEDROOM
     It is a tiny bedroom. The bed is covered with purses and 
     summer stoles and other guest things. An uncovered, 
     improvised closet, really a rack of hanging dresses and 
     things, gives the room an overburdened look. Charlie comes 
     into the room after her, closes the door, looks for the 
     latch. She pushes some of the things on the bed aside and 
     sits down and waits while Charlie latches the door, a matter 
     of turning a bent nail into locking position. She begins to 
     prattle again.
 
                    THE EXISTENTIALIST
          So I finally got to sleep around six 
          thirty this morning. At nine thirty, 
          someone began pounding on my door 
          again. I got out of bed and opened 
          the door, and there was my landlord 
          with the pince-nez wearing a blue 
          silk kimono. "Oh, for heaven's 
          sakes," I said, "what do you want 
          now?" He said: "I'm the landlord, 
          and I want the rent." I said: 
          "You're an old man, go to sleep." 
          Then the phone rang. It was a boy 
          named Andrew I know who teaches 
          physics at Columbia University, and 
          he's insanely jealous. He's married 
          and has four children, but he keeps 
          badgering me to run away with him to 
          Nicaragua, throw up his professorship 
          and all that. Well, my landlord began 
          shouting some garbled Baudelaire at 
          the top of his lungs, and a little 
          Verlaine, and a little Huysmans. He 
          apparently has some kind of fetish 
          about French decadents. And 
          naturally, Andrew heard him, and he 
          got furious, and he said: "Who's that 
          I hear?" I said, "That's the 
          landlord." He said: "What does he 
          want?" I said: "He wants the rent." 
          Well, at this point, I felt like 
          chucking the whole business and 
          going back to Bessemer City and 
          going to work in my father's 
          hardware store.
 
     Charlie has stood a moment, listening to this bizarre story. 
     Then he has busied himself cleaning a place beside The 
     Existentialist on the bed. He brings an end to the rococo 
     narration by putting his arms around The Existentialist and 
     in a moment, she responds hungrily.
 
     CLOSEUP of Charlie and The Existentialist in a desperate 
     embrace.
 
                    THE EXISTENTIALIST
               (muttering) 
          Just say you love me.
 
                    CHARLIE
          What?
 
                    THE EXISTENTIALIST
          Just say you love me. You don't have 
          to mean it. 

     He tries to kiss her again, himself charged high at the 
     moment, but she turns her face away from him. The dialogue 
     is intense, whispered, hungry.
 
                    THE EXISTENTIALIST
          No, don't. ...
 
                    CHARLIE
          What's the matter?
 
                    THE EXISTENTIALIST
          Say you love me....
 
                    CHARLIE
          Come on.
 
                    THE EXISTENTIALIST
          Say you love me....
 
                    CHARLIE
          Come on....
 
                    THE EXISTENTIALIST
          No ...
 
                    CHARLIE
          I love you! I love you!
 
                    THE EXISTENTIALIST
               (content)
          Look, maybe we ought to go someplace
          else? I'm having a very tricky thing 
          going with my landlord and I don't 
          want him to see us leaving together. 
          So you know what you do? There's a 
          bar down the street. You go out the 
          door and turn to your right. You 
          know the one I mean?  
 
                    CHARLIE
          Yes, I know.
 
                    THE EXISTENTIALIST
          Well, you go there and I'll be there 
          as fast as I can. Now, wait for me 
          now, because I can't stand being 
          alone at night. You'll like me. I'm 
          supposed to be very amusing. All 
          right?
 
     She turns abruptly and goes out the door. He stands for a 
     moment and then follows. He stands on the upper landing, 
     watching her pick her way down the stairs into the living 
     room.
 
     She looks quickly around the room, apparently finds whom she 
     is looking for, and moves quickly to a little group of men, 
     one of whom is about sixty years old with a thin elegance 
     and a cruel face, the landlord. He has several young men 
     around him, all rather frail, Ivy-Leagueish. She joins the 
     group, to the distaste of the young men, and is immediately 
     voluble and gesticulatory. After a moment, Charlie lets his 
     eyes wander over the room, apparently sees Eddie.
 
                    CHARLIE
               (calling down) 
          Hey, Eddie ...
 
     Apparently, Eddie doesn't hear him. Charlie frowns and 
     begins making his own way down the stairs to the living room.
 
     INTERIOR. LIVING ROOM -- GREENWICH VILLAGE APARTMENT
     Charlie moves down the stairs into the living room proper. 
     He makes his way to Eddie, who is still sitting in the back 
     of the room, throwing an intense pitch at his girl, talking 
     quickly, smiling, gesturing. 
 
                    CHARLIE
               (muttering) 
          Eddie, I'm cutting out.
 
                    EDDIE
               (standing, low voice) 
          Wait a minute, I'll go with you.
 
                    CHARLIE
          I don't want to take you away from 
          your girl, Eddie.
 
                    EDDIE
          Aah, this one lives out in Long 
          Island with her mother. What kind of 
          Communist is that? It'll take me a 
          half hour on the subway there and a 
          half hour back.
 
                    CHARLIE
               (shrugs) 
          Where's Arnold? Still in the kitchen?
 
                    EDDIE
          I guess so. 
               (to the girl) 
          I'll see you, next time I get to 
          Long Island. 

     He starts off after Charlie who is already wandering through 
     the living room in the general direction of the kitchen, 
     looking about for Arnold. They pass The Existentialist en 
     route. She is saying: "... this boy named Charlie, I never 
     saw him before in my life, has been clutching at me all 
     evening. He's absolutely insane about me." Charlie leans 
     into the kitchen where Arnold is awake now, seated at the 
     small kitchen table, staring gauntly, unseeingly at his 
     fingers on the white porcelain-topped table. There are two 
     men, one middle-aged, one young, having a whispered chat 
     over the sink.
 
                    EDDIE
               (over Charlie's 
               shoulder) 
          Hey, Arnold, come on.
 
     Arnold stands obediently, almost dumbly. He squeezes around 
     the table, his face soddenly expressionless, to join Eddie 
     and Charlie in the kitchen doorway. Eddie is saying to 
     Charlie:
 
                    EDDIE
          Well, it wasn't a bad party. We 
          killed a couple of hours anyway.
 
     The three men push their way past three women in their 
     thirties, who are standing in the little hallway before the 
     front door, in earnest brow-furrowed conversation with each 
     other. Charlie opens the door, and the three morose 
     carousers go out into the dark street.

     EXTERIOR. GREENWICH VILLAGE APARTMENT -- NIGHT 
     The three carousers come out into the street. The door 
     closes behind them. The night air is hot and muggy. They 
     walk down the street toward the corner where only the light 
     of the corner bar gives any indication of life. There is a 
     newspaper on the sidewalk which Eddie bends down to pick up, 
     and the three men straggle to a halt. Eddie opens the paper 
     to the sports pages and starts to read by the light of the 
     street lamp. Arnold moves a step to the lamp and leans 
     against it. Charlie stands in the middle of the sidewalk, a 
     melancholy, pondering young man. The evening seems to have 
     come to a dead halt. After a moment, Eddie starts walking 
     again, reading the paper as he does. The others slowly 
     gather themselves and follow him.

     INTERIOR. THE CORNER BAR 
     A wall clock reading twenty-five minutes to three. CAMERA 
     PANS DOWN the wall. We are in the bar on the corner of Tenth 
     and Sixth, almost entirely empty except for Charlie, Eddie, 
     Arnold, and the bartender. The three carousers are leaning 
     wearily on the bar over their beers; the only other person 
     in the bar is a worn, battered old veteran of the streets, a 
     woman in her forties, bespectacled, who is perched on a bar 
     stool at the far end of the bar, gloomily reading a 
     newspaper. CAMERA MOVES DOWN and IN on Charlie, Eddie, and 
     Arnold.
 
                    EDDIE
          ... I mean, you can't compare the 
          two. This kid the Yankees have in 
          centerfield. Are you trying to tell
          me he's a natural .368 hitter? What's 
          he normally hit, .310, .315? Musial 
          led the National League in hitting 
          six times. He's only having a fair 
          year, this year -- and he's still 
          hitting .320. Musial is an all-time 
          great!
 
                    CHARLIE
          Yeah. I guess so.
 
                    ARNOLD
               (stiff with liquor) 
          Eddie -- Eddie. So what do you think, 
          Eddie? You think I ought to go 
          through with this marriage?
 
                    EDDIE
          I don't know about you, Arnold, but 
          if it was me, boy, I'd be in China 
          by now. 
               (back to Charlie) 
          Who have the Yankees got on first? 
          Skowron. Boy, how they touted 
          Skowron. All right, he's having a 
          lucky year.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Yeah....
 
                    EDDIE
               (continuing) 
          ... Well, I mean, is there any 
          argument? Hodges is the best first 
          baseman in both leagues.... 
 
                    ARNOLD
          So, Eddie, what do you think? You 
          think I ought to marry her, go to 
          China, or what?
 
                    EDDIE
          Arnold, if it bothers you so much, 
          call her up and tell her to forget 
          the whole deal. 
               (back to Charlie) 
          All right Hodges is having a bad 
          year -- but how about last year? He 
          hit over .300. He only hit thirty-
          five homers and he drove in over a 
          hundred runs----
 
                    ARNOLD
          So, Eddie...
 
                    EDDIE
          Arnold! Get rid of her! You're 
          driving me crazy! 

     Arnold lowers his head, and he rises, loses his precarious 
     balance and moves backward a few lurching steps.
 
                    EDDIE
               (continuing) 
          All right, who's on second? We got 
          Charlie Neal or Gilliam, for that 
          matter, and this isn't even counting 
          Jackie Robinson, head and shoulders, 
          even with a trick knee, the best 
          second baseman in both leagues if 
          they'd let him play there. We got 
          three guys, for Pete's sake, who can 
          outplay anybody the Yankees put on 
          second. 

     Arnold weaves slowly up the bar to the two phone booths at 
     the far end of the counter. Then walks out of shot.
 
                    EDDIE
               (continuing) 
          Ever see Charlie Neal go to his 
          right? That Yankee guy, what's his 
          name -- he can't go to his right. 
          And don't forget Neal gets a lot of 
          bases on balls, and once he's on the 
          bases, man, it unnerves the pitcher ... 

     The bartender decides to take issue.
 
                    BARTENDER
          What's Brooklyn going to do for 
          pitching?  
 
                    EDDIE
          Never heard of Newcombe? Never heard 
          of Erskine?
 
                    BARTENDER
          What have you got to compare with 
          Ford, Kucks, McDermott, Turley---
 
                    EDDIE
          McDermott -- McDermott hasn't 
          pitched a full game since last year.
 
                    BARTENDER
          The best relief pitcher in both 
          leagues.
 
                    EDDIE
          What's the matter with Eddie Roebuck?
 
                    BARTENDER
          How do you compare Eddie Roebuck 
          with McDermott? 

                    EDDIE
          What are you, a Yankee fan? 

                    BARTENDER
          Yeah. 

                    EDDIE
          Well, drop dead.
               (turns angrily 
               back to Charlie) 
          A Yankee fan.
 
     There is a sudden bellow off.
 
                    ARNOLD'S VOICE
          Hey!
 
     Eddie and Charlie slowly turn to look in Arnold's direction. 
     CAMERA PANS to see Arnold from their point of view, a 
     wavering, drunken young man standing in front of the phone 
     booths.
 
                    ARNOLD
          I did it.
 
                    EDDIE
          You did what?
 
     Arnold staggers a few paces into the center of the empty bar.
 
                    ARNOLD
          I just woke her up! I called her! I 
          said: "I'm not going to marry you. 
          What do I want to marry you for? I'm 
          having a ball. What am I going to 
          marry you for?"
 
                    EDDIE
          What is he talking about?
 
     Then, suddenly, effortlessly, Arnold sinks down onto the 
     floor -- out cold. For a moment, Eddie and Charlie regard 
     the prostrate form.
 
                    BARTENDER
          Boy, he's gone.
 
     Eddie and Charlie move to Arnold, lying curled stiffly on 
     the floor.
 
                    CHARLIE
          I think he's just called his girl, 
          broke his engagement.
 
                    EDDIE
          Is that what he was yelling about?
 
                    CHARLIE
               (trying to raise 
               Arnold's head) 
          Wake up, kid. Help me get him up, 
          Eddie.
 
                    EDDIE
          You think he did it because I was 
          needling him there before? I was 
          just needling him.
 
     The two men contrive to lift Arnold and get him onto a stool.
 
                    BARTENDER
          You better get him out of here 
          because I'm closing up now.

                    CHARLIE
          We better get him home.
 
                    EDDIE
          Ah, let's not break it up yet. I 
          thought you were waiting for this 
          girl.
 
                    CHARLIE
          It's three o'clock in the morning, 
          for Pete's sake.
 
                    BARTENDER
          Take him out in the air. He'll be 
          all right.
 
                    CHARLIE
          What a bachelor party. We start out 
          celebrating the guy's wedding; we 
          wind up breaking his engagement. 
               (moves to bar) 
          What do we owe you here?
               (he puts some change 
               on the counter) 
          Eddie, pay it, will you? I gave you 
          the ten bucks.
 
                    EDDIE
               (following him 
               to the bar) 
          What do you want to go home for?
 
                    CHARLIE
          It's going to take us an hour to get 
          him home. He lives in Queens 
          somewheres. By the time I get back 
          to Fourteenth Street, it'll be 
          daybreak. What are you going to do, 
          stay up all night? Don't you want to 
          go home sometimes?
 
                    EDDIE
          What am I going to do home? I read 
          all the papers.
 
                    CHARLIE
               (crosses to Arnold)
          Well, go to sleep then.
 
                    EDDIE
          Ah, don't go home, Charlie. I feel 
          like doing something. 

     Charlie turns to him, a cold fury in him.
 
                    CHARLIE
          What? Stand around this bar and 
          argue about the Yankees and the 
          Dodgers? Wind up with some miserable, 
          lonely girl who begs you to say, "I 
          love you"? Go home, Eddie. Go to bed. 
          You got to go home sometimes. I'll 
          take Arnold home. Come on, Arnold, 
          kid. I'm going to take you home.
 
     Arnold manages, with Charlie's arm, to get out of the booth 
     and stand. Charlie's firm arm holds him, and they start for 
     the exit. Eddie watches the two figures making their way 
     down the length of the bar to the door. They exit. The door 
     shuts behind them. For a moment, Eddie regards the closed 
     door. Then he shuffles to the bar, back to his schooner of 
     beer and looks at it without taking it up. He is profoundly 
     weary. His shoulders slump, his face sags. He runs his hand 
     down his face and shakes his head as if to clear it. He 
     turns and looks down to the other end of the bar where the 
     Bar Hag sits engrossed in her newspaper. He watches her for 
     a moment.
 
                    EDDIE
               (spiritlessly) 
          Hey, honey, what are you, a Yankee 
          fan or a Dodger fan?
 
     The Bar Hag slowly turns to regard him over the rim of her 
     glasses.
 
                    BAR HAG
          Hiya.
 
     Bleakly, Eddie shuffles slowly down the long length of the 
     bar to where the battered old woman sits.

     EXTERIOR. THE BAR -- NIGHT 

     HIGH ANGLE SHOT looking down on the sidewalk immediately 
     outside the bar Arnold and Charlie have just come out of. 
     There is a house with a small stoop, and Arnold is standing 
     slumped by the stoop, holding himself up by the iron railing. 
     He is being sick, quietly retching. Charlie is standing a few 
     paces away from him in the middle of the sidewalk, a deeply 
     unhappy figure in his own right. From our angle, we may or 
     may not be able to tell that Charlie is crying.
 
     CLOSE SHOT of Charlie standing in the middle of the sidewalk 
     of Sixth Avenue and Tenth Street, the whole dark world around 
     him, silent and empty. He is crying quietly, unashamedly, his 
     shoulders shaking ever so little.  Behind him, Arnold is bent 
     over the railing of the stoop, weak and spent.
 
     ANOTHER SHOT of the two men. Charlie stops crying, sighs, and 
     starts toward Arnold.
 
                    CHARLIE
               (gently) 
          Are you all right, Arnold?
 
     Arnold nods weakly. Charlie gets out a handkerchief and 
     gives it to Arnold who begins to weakly clean his chin and 
     spots on his suit.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Would you like to go back in and 
          sit down? 

     Arnold shakes his head weakly "no."
 
                    CHARLIE
          What subway do you take, Arnold, 
          the BMT? Can you make it?
 
     Arnold nods weakly. Charlie puts his arm supportively around 
     his friend's back, but Arnold makes no move yet, being 
     thoroughly drained.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Come on, Arnold, I'll take you home.
 
     There is a clicking of high heels on concrete pavement, and 
     Charlie looks up. The Existentialist has just come out of 
     the party several houses down and has come up a few steps 
     and is standing watching them. She has her bag and her light 
     summer stole. She nods to Charlie, sort of smiles, moves a 
     few steps closer to them.
 
                    THE EXISTENTIALIST
          Is he all right?
 
                    CHARLIE
               (nods) 
          Yeah, he's all right. Look, I've got 
          to take my friend home...
 
     The two men start slowly down the street to the corner. 
     Arnold leaning heavily on his friend. The Existentialist 
     stands, watching them a moment.
 
                    THE EXISTENTIALIST
               (calling lightly) 
          Are you coming back? Where does he 
          live? How long will you be?
 
     REVERSE SHOT Charlie and Arnold just about getting to the 
     corner. Charlie hasn't heard her.
 
     FULL SHOT of The Existentialist watching them disappear 
     around the corner. Then she turns, and, wetting her lips, 
     she hurries back to the house where the party is.
 
     INTERIOR. BMT SUBWAY -- HURTLING NORTHWARD
     Half past three, and the car is absolutely empty except for 
     Charlie and Arnold. Arnold is sprawled across the straw seat, 
     one leg buckled beneath him, the other on the floor. He is 
     sleeping heavily. Charlie sits expressionlessly, obviously 
     involved in deep introspection. The car buckets along into 
     the night.

     INTERIOR. QUEENS APARTMENT HOUSE
     Arnold and Charlie coming up to a landing. It is the third 
     floor; we can see enough of the corridor to see two 
     apartment doors, lettered "3D" and "3C." A small overhead 
     bulb provides a thin sketchy light. Charlie and Arnold 
     shuffle down the landing to apartment 3D. They pause outside 
     the door. The scene is played in low mutters and whispers.
 
                    ARNOLD
          Well, thanks a lot, Charlie.
 
                    CHARLIE
          You all right?
 
                    ARNOLD
          Yeah, I'm all right. I'm a little 
          groggy, but I'm awake anyway. You 
          don't want to come in, do you?
 
                    CHARLIE
          No, I don't think so.
 
                    ARNOLD
          I think my father and mother are up. 
          I hear voices. My girl must have 
          called them because they wouldn't 
          be up at this hour.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Well, you just go in and explain to 
          them that you were drunk, and you're 
          sorry, and you'll call your girl the 
          first thing in the morning because 
          she must really be upset about this.
 
                    ARNOLD
               (who has been 
               listening at 
               his door) 
          I think she's here.

                    CHARLIE
          Who?
 
                    ARNOLD
          My girl. I think I hear her voice in 
          there.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Well, be nice to her, Arnold. 
          Remember, you woke her up in the 
          middle of the night and probably 
          scared her to death.
 
                    ARNOLD
          What'll I say to her, Charlie?
 
                    CHARLIE
          I don't know, Arnold. What do you 
          feel like saying to her? Do you 
          really love this girl? Do you want 
          to marry her? Are you marrying this 
          girl because your family wants you 
          to marry her, or why?
 
                    ARNOLD
          I think I like her, Charlie. It's 
          just that I'm afraid I won't make a 
          good husband.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Well, tell her what you told me, 
          Arnold. Tell her you're scared, and 
          that you don't think you'll make a 
          good husband. If she's a halfway 
          decent girl, she'll try to understand 
          how you feel, and, if she loves you, 
          she's going to make it her job to 
          make you happy. That's what love is, 
          Arnold, when you have somebody else 
          in the world you want to be happy. 
          My wife, Arnold, I don't know what 
          I'd do without her. Arnold, I've got 
          a tough grind ahead of me. Work all 
          day, I'll go to night school at night. 
          But my wife knows that I need this to 
          be happy, and she does everything she 
          knows to help me. And we've got a 
          baby coming. But if you love that 
          baby and you love your wife, then 
          it's easy. Everything seems so easy 
          to me now -- I don't know why I even 
          thought of quitting.
               (tears have welled 
               in his eyes, and he 
               hurriedly puts his 
               hand to his face 
               shading his reddening 
               eyes) 
          Arnold, I want my wife so much right 
          now. I want her to be happy. I want
          to just go home and hold her and tell 
          her how much she means to me. I mean, 
          even Walter, he's going to die, but 
          don't you think he'll be in tomorrow 
          morning, same old Walter, jokes and 
          laughs? He's got somebody to live 
          for. He's even got somebody to die 
          for. I mean, how rich can a man be? 
          And poor Eddie -- I used to be so 
          jealous of him. I used to think he 
          was so free. Free from what? From 
          loving a woman, from really wanting
          a woman. Arnold, what I'm trying to 
          tell you is life is nothing if you 
          don't love somebody but life is 
          wonderful if you do love somebody. 
          Arnold, I want my wife so much right 
          now ...
 
     Arnold is a little embarrassed by his friend's display of 
     emotion and, frankly, hasn't understood a word Charlie was 
     talking about.
 
                    ARNOLD
          I'm going to tell her about that 
          woman tonight and everything. I'll 
          tell her about that woman.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Arnold, I want to get home so much 
          to my wife right now I'm going to 
          bust.
 
                    ARNOLD
          I'll see you, Charlie.
 
                    CHARLIE
          Good-bye, Arnold, have a nice 
          honeymoon. I'll see you when you get 
          back.
 
                    ARNOLD
          I'll see you, Charlie.
 
     But he is talking to an empty staircase. Charlie has plunged 
     down into the darkness of the floor below. Arnold turns and 
     sighs and shuffles back to the door of his apartment. He 
     rings the bell lightly, takes a deep breath. A moment, and 
     the door opens. A girl of about thirty-five, bespectacled, 
     rather plain, with a sensitive face, stands in the doorway. 
     Arnold stands, his head down in shame.
 
                    ARNOLD
          Hello, Louise. I'm very sorry, 
          honest.
 
                    LOUISE 
          Sure, Arnold, I know.
 
     She looks anxiously over Arnold's shoulder to see if anyone 
     else is there. Arnold lumbers past her into the apartment. 
     Voices, both male and female, pop out at him. "What's the 
     matter with you, are you crazy?" "What's the matter with 
     you?" "For heaven's sakes, where have you been?" ... The 
     door closes.

     EXTERIOR. STUYVESANT TOWN HOUSING PROJECT
 
     LONG SHOT looking down the wide courtyard of Stuyvesant Town, 
     its endless little pathways winding from the various 
     apartment house doors to the central pathway which leads to 
     a stairway to the street. It is half past five in the morning. 
     The sky is gray and desolate. The courtyard and any other 
     street we see is absolutely empty. THE CAMERA PANS OVER this 
     empty expanse to the stairway where Charlie appears now, 
     coming quickly up the steps. He moves down the central 
     sidewalk, a little faster than he would usually walk; you have 
     the feeling he is exerting an effort to keep from running. 
     CAMERA PANS with him as he hurries to one of the winding side 
     lanes leading to a particular apartment house.

     INTERIOR. CHARLIE AND HELEN'S APARTMENT
 
     MEDIUM SHOT looking from the foyer of the apartment across 
     the dining area to the front door. The apartment is dark. 
     The door opens and Charlie comes in. He closes the door 
     quietly after himself and moves a few steps into the 
     apartment. He stops when he sees Helen seated on the couch, 
     wearing a kimono over her pajamas. She stands; she has been
     crying.
 
                    CHARLIE
          I love you, Helen.
 
     She moves slowly to him and puts her head on his chest and 
     cries quietly. He holds her tightly.
 
                    HELEN
               (crying softly) 
          I love you so much, Charlie. I love 
          you so much....
 
                    CHARLIE
          I love you....
 
                    HELEN
          I love you, Charlie, I love you, 
          Charlie. I love you, Charlie ...
 
     CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY UP AND AWAY from the young couple, 
     holding each other closely and tightly, murmuring to each 
     other in the dark living room of a two-and-a-half-room 
     apartment in a housing project.
