On VIDEO: JANE BURNHAM lays in bed, wearing a tank top. She's
sixteen, with dark, intense eyes.

<b>                    JANE
</b>          I need a father who's a role model, not
          some horny geek-boy who's gonna spray his
          shorts whenever I bring a girlfriend home
          from school.
              (snorts)
          What a lame-o. Somebody really should put
          him out of his misery.

Her mind wanders for a beat.

<b>                    RICKY (O.C.)
</b>          Want me to kill him for you?

Jane looks at us and sits up.

<b>                    JANE
</b>              (deadpan)
          Yeah, would you?

<b>                                               FADE TO BLACK.
</b>
<b>                                                        FADE IN:
</b>
<b>EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - EARLY MORNING
</b>
We're FLYING above suburban America, DESCENDING SLOWLY toward
a tree-lined street.

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.)
</b>          My name is Lester Burnham. This is my
          neighborhood. This is my street. This...
          is my life. I'm forty-two years old. In
          less than a year, I'll be dead.

<b>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
We're looking down at a king-sized BED from OVERHEAD:

LESTER BURNHAM lies sleeping amidst expensive bed linens,
face down, wearing PAJAMAS. An irritating ALARM CLOCK RINGS.
Lester gropes blindly to shut it off.

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.)
</b>          Of course, I don't know that yet. He
          rolls over, looks up at us and sighs. He
          doesn't seem too thrilled at the prospect
          of a new day.


<b>                                                   (CONTINUED)
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                              2.
</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          And in a way, I'm dead already.

He sits up and puts on his slippers.

<b>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BATH - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Lester thrusts his face directly into a steaming hot shower.

ANGLE from outside the shower: Lester's naked body is
silhouetted through the fogged-up glass door. It becomes
apparent he is masturbating.

<b>                     LESTER (V.O.)
</b>              (amused)
          Look at me, jerking off in the shower.
              (then)
          This will be the high point of my day.
          It's all downhill from here.

<b>EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
CLOSE on a single, dewy AMERICAN BEAUTY ROSE. A gloved hand
with CLIPPERS appears and SNIPS the flower off.

CAROLYN BURNHAM tends her rose bushes in front of the Burnham
house. A very well-put together woman of forty, she wears
color-coordinated gardening togs and has lots of useful and
expensive tools.

Lester watches her through a WINDOW on the first floor,
peeping out through the drapes.

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.)
</b>          That's my wife Carolyn. See the way the
          handle on those pruning shears matches
          her gardening clogs? That's not an
          accident.

<b>EXT. JIMS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
In the fenced front yard of the house next door, a dog BARKS
repeatedly. A MAN in a conservative suit (JIM #1) chastises
the barking dog.

<b>                    JIM #1
</b>          Hush, Bitsy. You hush. What is wrong?

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.)
</b>          That's our next-door neighbor Jim.

A second MAN in a conservative suit (JIM #2) comes out of the
house.

<b>                                                    (CONTINUED)
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                              3.
</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          And that's his lover, Jim.

<b>                    JIM #2
</b>              (re: barking dog)
          What in the world is wrong with her? She
          had a walk this morning.

<b>                    JIM #1
</b>          And a jerky treat.

<b>                    JIM #2
</b>          You spoil her.
              (sternly)
          Bitsy. No bark. Come inside. Now.

<b>EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Lester watches all this from the window.

<b>                    CAROLYN
</b>          Good morning, Jim!

Jim #1 walks toward the fence to greet Carolyn.

<b>                    JIM #1
</b>          Morning, Carolyn.

<b>                    CAROLYN
</b>              (overly friendly)
          I just love your tie! That color!

<b>                    JIM #1
</b>          I just love your roses. How do you get
          them to flourish like this?

<b>                    CAROLYN
</b>          Well, I'll tell you. Egg shells and
          Miracle Grow.

Jim #1 and Carolyn continue to chat, unaware that Lester is
watching them.

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.)
</b>          Man. I get exhausted just watching her.

Lester's POV: We can't hear what Jim and Carolyn are saying,
but she's overly animated, like a TV talk show host.

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          She wasn't always like this. She used to
          be happy. We used to be happy.
<b>
</b><b>                                                              4.
</b>


<b>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
JANE is seated at her desk, working at her computer.

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.)
</b>          My daughter Jane. Only child.

CLOSE on the COMPUTER MONITOR: A PERSONAL BANKING SOFTWARE
window suddenly disappears to reveal another window: a
PLASTIC SURGERY WEBSITE, featuring clinical "before" and
"after" photos of surgically augmented breasts.

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Janie's a pretty typical teenager. Angry,
          insecure, confused. I wish I could tell
          her that's all going to pass...

Outside, a CAR HORN BLARES. Jane stuffs items into her
<b>BACKPACK.
</b>
<b>                    LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          But I don't want to lie to her.

We HEAR the CAR HORN again from outside. Jane studies herself
in a mirror, then shifts to get a good profile of her
breasts.

<b>EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Carolyn stands next to a platinum-colored MERCEDES-BENZ
ML320, reaching in through the drivers' window to blow the
HORN again.

Jane shuffles out of the house, her backpack slung over her
shoulder.

<b>                    CAROLYN
</b>          Jane. Honey. Are you trying to look
          unattractive?

<b>                    JANE
</b>          Yes.

<b>                     CAROLYN
</b>          Well, congratulations. You've succeeded
          admirably.

Jane gets in the car. Lester hurries out the front door,
carrying a BRIEFCASE.




<b>                                                    (CONTINUED)
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                             5.
</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>

<b>                    CAROLYN (CONT'D)
</b>          Lester, could you make me a little later,
          please? Because I'm not quite late
          enough.

Lester's briefcase suddenly springs open and his papers spill
all over the driveway. He drops to his knees to gather
everything.

<b>                    JANE
</b>          Nice going, Dad.

Lester smiles sheepishly, trying to lighten the moment.

His POV: Carolyn looks down at us, contemptuous but also
bored, as if she gave up expecting anything more long ago.

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.)
</b>          Both my wife and daughter think I'm this
          gigantic loser, and... they're right.

<b>INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - A SHORT TIME LATER
</b>
Carolyn is driving; Jane stares out the window. Lester is
asleep in the back seat.

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.)
</b>          I have lost something. I'm not exactly
          sure what it is, but I know I didn't
          always feel this... sedated. But you know
          what? It's never too late to get it back.

<b>INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
</b>
Lester sits at his workstation, a BEIGE CUBICLE surrounded by
IDENTICAL BEIGE CUBICLES. He's staring at a computer monitor
and talking on a HEADSET PHONE. The beleaguered expression on
his face is at odds with the light, friendly tone of his
voice.

<b>                    LESTER
</b>          Hello, this is Lester Burnham from Media
          Monthly magazine, I'm calling for Mr.
          Tamblin, please?... Well, we're all under
          a deadline here, uh, but you see, there
          is some basic information about the
          product launch that isn't even covered in
          your press release and I... Yeah. Can I
          ask you a question? Who is Tamblin? Does
          he exist? 'Cause he doesn't ever seem to
          come in... Yeah, okay, I'll leave my
          number...

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>

BRAD, a dapper man in his thirties, approaches and observes
Lester, who is unaware of his presence.

<b>                    LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>          It's 555 0199. Lester Burnham. Thank you!

Lester disconnects the call, obviously irritated.

<b>                    BRAD
</b>          Hey Les. You got a minute?

Lester turns around, smiling perfunctorily

<b>                    LESTER
</b>          For you, Brad? I've got five.

<b>INT. BRAD'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Brad is seated behind his desk in his big corner office.

<b>                    BRAD
</b>          I'm sure you can understand our need to
          cut corners around here.

Lester sits across from him, looking small and isolated.

Brad stands, ready to usher Lester out.

          Like the time when Mr. Flournoy used the

          hooker, and then she used the card
          numbers and stayed at the St. Regis for,

          yet. That's why we're having everyone
          write out a job description, mapping out
          in detail how they contribute. That way,
          management can assess who's valuable and--

<b>                    LESTER
</b>          Who's expendable.

<b>                    BRAD

Lester stares at him, powerless.

<b>EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

A MOVING VAN is parked in front of the COLONIAL HOUSE next
door to the Burnhams'. Movers carry furniture toward the
house.

The Mercedes-Benz pulls into the Burnham driveway. Carolyn

          --"The Real Estate King," that house

          six months.

She heads into the house, followed by Lester.

<b>                    LESTER
</b>          Well, they were still mad at you for
          cutting down their sycamore.

<b>                    CAROLYN
</b>          Their sycamore? C'mon! A substantial
          portion of the root structure was on our

          it their sycamore? I wouldn't have the
          heart to just cut down something if it
          wasn't partially mine, which of course it
          was.

<b>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

We HEAR EASY-LISTENING MUSIC.

Lester, Carolyn and Jane are eating dinner by CANDLELIGHT.
RED ROSES are bunched in a vase at the center of the table.
Nobody makes eye contact, or even seems aware of anybody
else's presence, until...

Jane puts her plate in the dishwasher and leaves. We FOLLOW
HER out the door, then the camera JERKS back to Lester
calling after her.

CLOSE on the face of   RICKY FITTS, illuminated by the screen
of his DIGICAM as he   videotapes. Ricky is eighteen, but his
eyes are much older.   Beneath his Zen-like tranquility lurks
something wounded...   and dangerous.

His POV, on VIDEO: Through the kitchen window, we see Lester
at the sink, rinsing off his plate, muttering to himself. His
head suddenly jerks up and he looks at us, as if he realizes
he's being watched.

<b>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Lester's POV: We're looking out through the kitchen window at
the point where Ricky was just standing, but he's no longer
there.

Lester turns off the faucet, dries his hands, then tosses the
towel on the counter on his way out, where it lands next to a
framed PHOTOGRAPH of Lester, Carolyn, and a much-younger
Jane, taken several years earlier at an amusement park.

It's startling how happy they look.

<b>EXT. SALE HOUSE - DAY

CLOSE on a wooden SIGN that reads:

<b>OPEN HOUSE TODAY

<b>BURNHAM &amp; ASSOCIATES REALTY
</b>
555-0195 Carolyn Burnham

The sign is planted in front of a RUN-DOWN HOME in a   run-down
neighborhood. The Mercedes is parked in front of the   house.
Carolyn, wearing a smart business suit, is unloading   a box of
cleaning supplies and a BOOMBOX from the back of the   Mercedes
when something across the street catches her eye.

Her POV: In front of a different house with much more curb
appeal is another SIGN, featuring a picture of a handsome
silver-haired MAN. It reads:

Another One SOLD By Buddy Kane

Carolyn frowns and slams the back of the Mercedes shut.

The interior of this house is ugly, oppressive and tasteless.
Carolyn opens the front door, breathes deeply and solemnly
announces:

She neatly arranges her sales materials on a desk, then
strips down to her undergarments.

Cleans glass doors that overlook the patio and pool;

Doggedly scrubs countertops in the kitchen;

Perches on a stepladder to dust a cheap-looking ceiling fan
in the master bedroom;

And vacuums a dirty carpet that will never be clean.

Throughout all this, she keeps repeating to herself:

<b>                    CAROLYN (CONT'D)

more, applying lipstick. She stares at her reflection
critically.

She says this as if it were a threat, then notices a smudge
on the mirror and wipes it off.

Carolyn enters, alone. She's furious. She locks the sliding
glass door and starts to pull the vertical blinds shut, then
stops. Standing very still, with the blinds casting shadows
across her face, she starts to cry: brief, staccato SOBS that
seemingly escape against her will. Suddenly she SLAPS
herself, hard.

She SLAPS herself repeatedly until she stops crying. She
stands there, taking deep breaths until she has everything
under control, then pulls the blinds shut, once again all
business. She walks out calmly, leaving us alone in the dark,
empty room.

We HEAR CHEERING and APPLAUSE.

Seated in the bleachers, next to the high school BAND, is a
group of about twenty TEENAGE GIRLS, dressed in pale blue and
white uniforms. Among them, Jane sits next to ANGELA HAYES.
At sixteen, Angela is strikingly beautiful; with perfect even
features, blonde hair and a nubile young body, she's the

Jane stands and scans the bleachers.

The HIGH SCHOOL BAND plays "ON BROADWAY." On the gym floor,
the girls perform. They're well-rehearsed, but too young to
carry off the ambitious Vegas routine they're attempting.

Lester, watching from the stands, picks out his daughter.

next to her is Angela. Suddenly Angela looks right at us and
smiles... a lazy, insolent smile.

Lester leans forward in his seat.

SLOW DOWN... the MUSIC acquires an eerie ECHO...

We ZOOM slowly toward Lester as he watches, transfixed.

His POV: Angela's awkwardness gives way to a fluid grace, and
"ON BROADWAY" FADES into dreamy, hypnotic MUSIC. The light on
Angela grows stronger, and the other girls DISAPPEAR
entirely.

Lester is suddenly alone in the stands, spellbound.

His POV: Angela looks directly at us now, dancing only for
Lester. Her movements take on a blatantly erotic edge as she
starts to unzip her uniform, teasing us with an expression
that's both innocent and knowing, then... she pulls her
uniform OPEN and a profusion of RED ROSE PETALS spill
forth... and we SMASH CUT TO:

Angela, fully clothed, is once again surrounded by the other

Carolyn claps along with the rest of the audience. Lester

CLOSE on a solitary red ROSE PETAL as it falls slowly through
the air.

We're looking down on Lester and Carolyn in bed. Even in
sleep, Carolyn looks determined. Lester is awake and stares
up at us.

<b>                    LESTER
</b>          It's the weirdest thing.

The ROSE PETAL drifts into view, landing on his pillow.

</b>          I feel like I've been in a coma for about
          twenty years, and I'm just now waking up.

More ROSE PETALS fall onto the bed, and he smiles up at...

His POV: Angela, naked, FLOATS above us as a deluge of ROSE
PETALS falls around her. Her hair fans out around her head
and GLOWS with a subtle, burnished light. She looks down at
us with a smile that is all things...

Lester smiles back and LAUGHS, as ROSE PETALS cover his face.

<b>                    ANGELA
</b>          It's okay. I'm used to guys drooling over
          me. It started when I was about twelve,
          I'd go out to dinner with my parents.
          Every Thursday night, Red Lobster. And
          every guy there would stare at me when I
          walked in. And I knew what they were
          thinking. Just like I knew guys at school
          thought about me when they jerked off.

</b>          No, I liked it. And I still like it. If
          people I don't even know look at me and
          want to fuck me, it means I really have a
          shot at being a model. Which is great,
          because there's nothing worse in life
          than being ordinary.

An awkward beat. Jane stares at the floor.

<b>                    JANE
</b>          I really think it'll happen for you.

<b>                    ANGELA

On VIDEO: Jane gets out of the car, still LAUGHING, and waves
as Angela pulls away. We ZOOM toward Jane as she walks up the
driveway. She turns suddenly, sensing our presence.

Her POV: We're looking at the COLONIAL HOUSE next door where
the moving van was parked earlier. The front porch is
shrouded in darkness... then a PORCH LIGHT abruptly reveals
Ricky. As usual, he's dressed conservatively. There is a
BEEPER attached to his belt, and his DIGICAM dangles loosely
around his neck.

Irritated, Jane stares at him, hard.

<b>                     JANE
</b>          Asshole.

He looks back at her curiously, then raises his Digicam and
starts to videotape her.

walks quickly toward her house, flipping us off as she goes.

Jane enters, closes and locks the door. She quickly TURNS OFF

Jane turns back into the room, her heart racing... and
smiles.

CLOSE on an ADDRESS BOOK: A man's hand flips to the H page
and then his finger stops at the name Angela Hayes.

Lester, dressed for work, goes through Jane's address book.
We HEAR the SHOWER running in the adjacent bathroom. He grabs
Jane's phone and dials, then stands with the receiver to his
ear, nervous.

Lester is frozen, unable to speak. Suddenly, the SHOWER is
turned off in the next room. Lester hangs up and exits
quickly. A moment, then the PHONE RINGS. Jane emerges from
the bathroom, a towel wrapped around her torso, drying her
wet hair. She picks up the PHONE.

BARBARA FITTS stands at the stove, flipping bacon strips
mechanically, her eyes focused elsewhere. At least ten years
younger than her husband, she's pretty in a June Cleaver-ish
way. The Colonel sits at a dinette reading The Wall Street
Journal. Ricky enters.

Angela stares at Jane, then her mouth widens into a smile.

<b>                    ANGELA
</b>          You total slut. You've got a crush on
          him.

Jane suddenly finds Ricky standing in front of her.

<b>                    RICKY
</b>          Hi. My name's Ricky. I just moved next
          door to you.

<b>                    JANE
</b>          I know. I kinda remember this really

          last night?

<b>                    RICKY
</b>          I didn't mean to scare you. I just think

Angela shoots a wide-eyed look at Jane, who ignores it.

</b>          Thanks, but I really don't need to have
          some psycho obsessing about me right now.

<b>                    RICKY
</b>          I'm not obsessing. I'm just curious.

He looks at her intently, his eyes searching hers. Jane is
unnerved and has to look away. Ricky smiles and walks off.

<b>INT. FITTS HOUSE - DEN - THAT NIGHT

CLOSE on a TV SCREEN: "Hogan's Heroes" on Nick at Nite.

The Colonel and Barbara are seated on a couch, watching
television. The Colonel is smiling, enjoying the show;
Barbara just stares. The Colonel CHUCKLES at a joke and
startles her.

We HEAR a door opening elsewhere in the house, and Ricky
enters.

<b>                    RICKY
</b>          Hey.

He sits on the couch, next to his father, and watches TV
along with them. The Colonel's smile fades.

We HEAR MUSIC under a room full of people all talking at
once, as Lester and Carolyn enter a hotel ballroom. We FOLLOW
THEM as they pass a SIGN that reads:

<b>                    LESTER
</b>          Well, you always end up ignoring me and
          going off--

Inside the ballroom, well-dressed real estate professionals
stand in clumps, chatting. Catering waiters serve hors
d'eouvres.

<b>                    CAROLYN
</b>          Now listen to me. This is an important

</b>              (spots someone)
          Oh! Buddy!

She drags Lester toward a silver-haired MAN and his much
younger WIFE. We recognize the Man as BUDDY KANE, The Real

          It's a pleasure.

<b>                    LESTER
</b>          Oh, we've met before, actually. This

          at the Sheraton.

</b>          Oh, yes.

<b>                    LESTER

He LAUGHS. A little too loudly. Carolyn quickly joins in.

<b>                    CAROLYN
</b>              (forced gaiety)
          Honey. Don't be weird.

She smiles her most winning smile at him. He knows this
persona well, only it's never pissed him off as much as it
does right now.

<b>                    LESTER
</b>          All right, honey. I won't be weird.
              (his face close to hers)
          I'll be whatever you want me to be.

And he kisses her--a soft, warm kiss that speaks unmistakably
of sex--then turns to the others and grins.

<b>                    LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>          We have a very healthy relationship.

Carolyn's smile is frozen on her face.

<b>                    LESTER

He crosses off. Carolyn, Buddy and Christy watch him go.

<b>INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Lester stands at the bar. A bartender pours him a drink.

<b>                    LESTER
</b>          Whoa. Put a little more in there, cowboy.

The bartender complies. Lester takes his drink and turns to
face the center of the room.

His POV: Carolyn is talking to Buddy and Christy. She's on:
smiling, animated, LAUGHING too loud at their jokes.

Lester shakes his head. Ricky approaches him, wearing a
waiter's uniform, carrying a tray of empty glasses.

<b>                    RICKY

<b>                    RICKY
</b>          Hi, Lester Burnham.

A beat. Lester looks away, scans the crowd, then downs the
rest of his drink in one gulp. Ricky just stands there,
watching him. Finally Lester turns back to Ricky: what does
this kid want?

<b>                    RICKY (CONT'D)

Lester's surprised, but instantly intrigued.

Carolyn and Buddy are deep in conversation. Christy has
wandered off. Carolyn is nervous; Buddy seems amused.

<b>                    CAROLYN
</b>          You know, I probably wouldn't even tell
          you this if I weren't a little tipsy,
          but... I am in complete awe of you. I
          mean, your firm is, hands down, the Rolls
          Royce of local Real Estate firms, and
          your personal sales record is, is, is
          very intimidating. You know, I'd love to
          sit down with you and just pick your
          brain, if you'd ever be willing. I
          suppose, technically, I'm the
          "competition," but... I mean, hey, I
          don't flatter myself that I'm even in the
          same league as you...

<b>                    BUDDY

          Really?

<b>                    BUDDY

<b>                    CAROLYN

They look at each other for a beat, then look away. This
situation is loaded and they both know it.

<b>EXT. HOTEL - LATER

Ricky and Lester stand next to a dumpster behind the service
entrance to the hotel, smoking a JOINT.

<b>                    LESTER
</b>          ...did you ever see that movie, where the
          body's walking around holding its own

He goes back inside. Lester looks at Ricky, who shrugs.

<b>                     LESTER
</b>          I think you just became my personal hero.
              (then)

<b>                       CAROLYN (O.C.)

She reaches inside the refrigerator to grab a bottle. As she
does, she moves to place her other hand casually on Lester's
shoulder. He sees it coming. Everything SLOWS DOWN, and all
sound FADES...

EXTREME CLOSE UP on her hand as it briefly touches his
shoulder in SLOW MOTION. We HEAR only the amplified BRUSH of
her fingers against the fabric of his suit, and its
unnatural, hollow ECHO...

BACK IN REAL TIME: She grabs the root beer and smiles at him.

CLOSE on Lester: his eyes narrow slightly, then:

He cups her face in his hands and kisses her. She seems
shocked, but doesn't resist as he pulls her toward him    with
surprising strength. He breaks the kiss, looking at her    in
awe, then he reaches up and touches his lips. His eyes    widen

<b>                    JANE
</b>          Yeah, to you, he's just another guy who

</b>          Your mom's the one who's embarrassing.
          What a phony.

Jane glances at Angela, irritated.

Lester, still in his suit, stands outside Jane's room, his
ear up against the door. He can't believe what he's hearing.

<b>                    ANGELA (O.C.)

          peek at him in his underwear? I bet he's
          got a big dick.

<b>                    JANE

</b>              (really enjoying this)
          If he built up his chest and arms, I
          would totally fuck him.

Jane covers her ears and starts SINGING to drown her out.

Lester, still listening, looks like he's about to implode.

<b>                     ANGELA (O.C.)
</b>              (laughs)
          I would! I would suck your dad's big fat
          dick, and then I would fuck him 'til his
          eyes rolled back in his head!
              (then)
          What was that noise? Jane.

Jane's SINGING stops.

Panicked, Lester scurries down the hall.

Angela crosses to the window and looks out.

On VIDEO: We're across from Jane's window, looking in. Jane
tries to shut the drapes, but Angela won't let her.
Irritated, Jane retreats into the room. We ZOOM toward her,
even as Angela poses in the window; we're clearly not
interested in Angela. The ZOOM continues, searching for Jane,
who has disappeared. Finally, we settle on the small make-up
MIRROR where we see a REFLECTION of Jane, back at her
computer. She's smiling. Then suddenly the DRAPES CLOSE and
she's gone.

at:

through shelves against the back wall.

Lester digs through stuff stored on the shelves, searching
for something as if his very life depended on it.

<b>                    LESTER
</b>          Shit. Shit!

He yanks aside COLLEGE YEARBOOKS, a racquetball RACQUET,
boxes of old HOT ROD MAGAZINES, an unopened remote-controlled
MODEL JEEP KIT, stacks of old vinyl LPs... finally his face
lights up when he finds:

A pair of DUMBBELLS obviously unused for many years.

Lester rips off his jacket and tie and unbuttons his shirt.
He glances around, finding his REFLECTION in the WINDOW as he
pulls off his shirt, then the T-shirt underneath. He eyes
himself critically: Angela was right, he's not in bad shape.
Just a few extra pounds around his middle that wouldn't be
hard to shed. He kicks off his shoes and begins to step out
of his pants.

Suddenly we HEAR someone trying to open a locked door.

<b>                    COLONEL (O.C.)
</b>          Ricky!

Moving swiftly, Ricky pulls the drapes shut and switches on a
light. His room is a haven of high-tech. A state-of-the-art
multimedia COMPUTER crowds his desk, and high-end STEREO and
VIDEO EQUIPMENT line the shelves, as well as HUNDREDS OF CDs.
There is easily twenty thousand dollars worth of equipment in
this room.

</b>          I'm sorry, I must have locked it by

The Colonel holds out a small PLASTIC CUP WITH A CAP.

</b>          Yeah, I suppose.
              (an awkward beat)
          Well. Good night, son.

He disappears down the hall. Ricky smiles, shuts and locks
his door. He puts the plastic cup on the shelf, then crosses
to a MINI REFRIGERATOR in the corner of his room and takes
out a cup-sized TUPPERWARE CONTAINER from the freezer,
already filled with urine, albeit frozen, and places it on a
saucer to thaw overnight.

Carolyn lies sleeping. Lester is awake, staring at the
ceiling. After a moment, he gets up, taking care not to
disturb Carolyn, and walks toward the bathroom.

<b>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BATH - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Lester enters and switches on the LIGHT. The room is filled
with STEAM. Lester looks around, confused, then focuses on:

His POV: Across from us, in a PEDESTAL BATHTUB, is Angela.
She smiles and beckons us, and we MOVE CLOSER. ROSE PETALS
float on the surface of the water, obscuring her naked body.

<b>                    ANGELA
</b>          I've been waiting for you.

Lester kneels by the bathtub like a man in church.

</b>          You've been working out, haven't you? I

She arches her back and looks up at him provocatively.

</b>          I was hoping you'd give me a bath... I'm
          very, very dirty.

Lester gives her a hard look, then slowly slips his hand into
the water between her legs. Her eyes widen and she throws her
head back... and we SMASH CUT TO:

BRUSH of Lester's hand as he masturbates under the covers.

She flips over and faces him.

A beat.

She sinks into a chair, stunned. It's clear he knows where
she's most vulnerable. He sees this, and likes it; it feels
good to win for a change. He curls up under the covers
contentedly.

<b>EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - LATER

Carolyn, carrying a basket of fresh cut ROSES, passes by the
GARAGE WINDOW. From inside the garage, we HEAR ROCK MUSIC.

Carolyn stops and SNIFFS the air, frowning. She peers through
the window.

Her POV: Lester, in a T-shirt and gym shorts, lies on a new
WEIGHT BENCH, doing bench presses with shiny new BARBELLS.

<b>INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
ROCK MUSIC blasts from a new BOOMBOX on the floor.

The garage is in the process of becoming Lester's sanctuary.
An ugly but comfortable 70's BOWL CHAIR has been pulled out
and cleaned off, his old hot rod magazines strewn across it,
and the remote-controlled MODEL JEEP KIT is spread across a
card table. The SHELVES that Lester tore through earlier have
been dismantled, leaving a blank wall on which now hangs a
<b>DART BOARD.
</b>
Lester finishes his last rep, straining, then puts the
weights in their rack and sits up. As he takes a drag off a
joint, the GARAGE DOOR suddenly starts to open. Lester looks
up, squinting at:

against the bright sunlight outside, pointing a REMOTE at us.

<b>                    CAROLYN
</b>          I see you're smoking pot now. I'm so

<b>                    BUDDY
</b>          I'm so sorry I kept you waiting. Christy

</b>          Oh yeah, I go to this little firing range

          Well, almost nothing.

Carolyn is quick to pick up her cue and kisses him, ready for
another round.

Ricky and Jane walk along without speaking. He seems

</b>          The people who used to live there fed
          these stray cats, so they were always
          around, and it drove my mother nuts. And
          then she cut down their tree.

An automobile FUNERAL PROCESSION appears and begins to pass
them slowly.

On VIDEO: We're in an empty parking lot on a cold, gray day.
Something is floating across from us... it's an empty,
wrinkled, white PLASTIC BAG. We follow it as the wind carries
it in a circle around us, sometimes whipping it about
violently, or, without warning, sending it soaring skyward,
then letting it float gracefully down to the ground...

Jane and Ricky sit on the bed, watching his WIDE-SCREEN TV.

<b>                    RICKY
</b>          It was one of those days when it's a
          minute away from snowing. And there's
          this electricity in the air, you can
          almost hear it, right? And this bag was
          just... dancing with me. Like a little
          kid begging me to play with it. For
          fifteen minutes. That's the day I
          realized that there was this entire life
          behind things, and this incredibly
          benevolent force that wanted me to know
          there was no reason to be afraid. Ever.

A beat.

<b>                    RICKY (CONT'D)
</b>          Video's a poor excuse, I know. But it
          helps me remember... I need to
          remember...

Now Jane is watching him.

</b>              (distant)
          Sometimes there's so much beauty in the
          world I feel like I can't take it... and
          my heart is going to cave in.

After a moment, Jane takes his hand. Then she leans in and
kisses him softly on the lips. His eyes scan hers, curious to
see how she reacts to this...

far and there's no turning back. She stands there with her
breasts exposed, trying to look defiant, but she's achingly

behind the drape. She quickly pulls it shut.

A beat. The Colonel is suddenly, deeply shamed.

But something keeps him from doing it.

Bobby Darin sings "DON'T RAIN ON MY    PARADE" on the RADIO.
Carolyn SINGS along as she drives.    Her face has lost its
usual resolute determination; she's    actually enjoying herself
spontaneously, and the lack of her    usual self-consciousness
allows us to see just how beautiful    she is.

Carolyn takes the gun and holds it at arm's length, admiring
it as she continues to SING.

Lester's REMOTE-CONTROLLED MODEL JEEP is zooming across the
floor of the family room, expertly maneuvering corners and
narrowly avoiding crashing.

Lester is sprawled on the couch in his underwear, drinking a
BEER and controlling the car. His working out is beginning to
produce results. The room, too, seems changed: sloppier, more
lived in.

Carolyn enters through the kitchen, flushed and angry. She
just stands there, staring at Lester. After a moment, he
looks up at her.

His face is close to hers, and suddenly the atmosphere is

drawn to him. He smiles, and moves even closer, holding his
beer loosely balanced. Then, just before their lips meet...

smile fades, and the moment is gone.

We're watching the WIDE-SCREEN TV in Ricky's room.

A CORD leads from the TV to Ricky's DIGICAM. Ricky holds the

since his father beat him up, and there are still slight
SCARS on his face. He's aiming his camera at Jane.

door and dashes up the driveway.

The blender GRINDS as Lester, still in his sweatpants, makes
himself a high-protein shake. He's in excellent shape; even
his posture has changed, and he moves with the confident,
easy swagger of an athlete. Jane watches him blankly from the
kitchen table.

Carolyn enters. Lester leans against the counter, drinking
his shake directly from the blender pitcher, eyeing her. He's
got a newfound sexual energy that makes her uncomfortable,
and he knows it. Carolyn quickly rinses off her coffee cup,
avoiding his eyes, and starts out.

          You better watch yourself, Janie, or

          just like your mother.

Jane is stunned. She quickly rises, trying to get out of the
kitchen before she starts crying.

ANGLE on Lester, and the immediate regret in his eyes.

<b>INT. FITTS HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
We're outside Ricky's room, MOVING slowly toward the open
door, through which we can see Ricky, standing at his bureau
mirror, combing his hair. The scars on his face are almost
gone now.

A REVERSE ANGLE reveals the Colonel standing outside the door
looking in, watching Ricky with great tenderness. Then Ricky
looks up at him, and the Colonel is suddenly self-conscious.

<b>                    COLONEL

          You ready to go?

          in with Jane and her mom.

<b>EXT. FITTS HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Ricky emerges from the house, followed by the Colonel, who
watches his son as he heads toward the Burnham house.

His POV: Carolyn waves from the Mercedes, flashing an
insincere smile. Jane leans forward from the passenger seat
and glares at us. As Ricky starts to get in the car, Lester
emerges from the house in his sweatpants.

<b>                    LESTER
</b>          Yo, Ricky. How's it going?

<b>                    RICKY
</b>          Pretty decent, Mr. Burnham.

Ricky pulls his door shut, but not before Lester mouths "call
me" and Ricky gives a slight nod in acknowledgment.

CLOSE on the Colonel's face: he looks confused.

As the Mercedes backs out of the driveway, Lester glances
over at him.

Lester's POV: The Colonel watches the car driving off, then
looks at us. His face tightens.

LESTER studies him for a moment, then grins and salutes
before going inside the house.

CLOSE on the Colonel, deeply troubled.

<b>INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
The door swings open silently and the Colonel enters. He
starts going through Ricky's bureau. He opens the DRAWER in
which we know Ricky keeps his marijuana, but he doesn't
discover its false bottom. He stands and looks around, his
eyes finally landing on:

The DIGICAM and a stack of CASSETTES on a shelf. The camera
is still connected to the TV.

The Colonel turns on the TV, examines the Digicam and presses
"play." The TV's blank screen suddenly gives way to...

On VIDEO: Barbara Fitts sits at the kitchen table, staring
off into space.

The Colonel watches, at first baffled, then impatient. He
takes the cassette out of the Digicam and inserts another. On
the TV screen we see...

On VIDEO: Through the Burnham's GARAGE WINDOW, we see Lester
step out of his pants and briefs. Then, naked except for his
black socks, he grabs the dumbbells and starts lifting them,
watching his reflection in the window as he does...

The Colonel sinks slowly onto Ricky's bed, mesmerized.

Lester, wearing a Mr. Smiley's uniform, is happily flipping
burgers on a grill.

Lester's face darkens, then... he smiles. He puts his spatula
down.

The Mercedes pulls around to the DRIVE-THRU WINDOW. Carolyn
drives; Buddy sits beside her.

Lester leans out of the drive-thru window, grinning at her,
holding bags filled with fast food. The Counter Girl stands
next to him, staring blankly.

Carolyn struggles to appear nonchalant.

Carolyn closes her eyes, defeated, then grabs the wheel,
shifts gears and drives off.

The sky is filled with ominous gray clouds. Wind whips
garbage across the parking lot as Carolyn's Mercedes pulls in
next to Buddy's Jaguar.

<b>INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - CONTINUOUS

Carolyn grips the wheel tightly, staring straight ahead.
Buddy looks at her unhappily.

<b>                    BUDDY
</b>          I'm sorry. I guess we should cool it for
          a while. I'm facing a potentially very

</b>          Oh, no. I understand completely.
              (sarcastic)
          In order to be successful, one must
          project an image of success. At all
          times.

She regrets it the second it's out of her mouth, and turns to
him. He just looks at her sadly, then gets out of the car and
shuts the door. She starts to CRY. As before, she SLAPS
herself, hard.

<b>                    CAROLYN (CONT'D)
</b>          Stop it. Stop it!

She closes her eyes tight, trying to stop the tears, then
suddenly SCREAMS as loud as she can.

<b>EXT. TOP HAT MOTEL - CONTINUOUS

Buddy's Jaguar speeds off, leaving the Mercedes alone in the
parking lot. We can still HEAR Carolyn's muffled SCREAMING.
There is a sound of distant THUNDER.

<b>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - THAT NIGHT

It's RAINING outside. We HEAR ROCK MUSIC as Lester pumps
iron. He puts the weights down and looks at his REFLECTION in
the window:

His POV: His arms are pumped. He smiles.

He reaches under the bench and grabs a CIGAR BOX. Opening it,
he digs through MARIJUANA PARAPHERNALIA, only to pull out an
empty ZIP-LOC BAG.

<b>INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Ricky and the Colonel sit at the table, eating in silence.
Barbara rinses off a pan at the sink, then stares at it as if
she can't quite remember what she meant to do with it. We
suddenly HEAR a BEEPING noise. Ricky pulls his BEEPER off his
belt and checks it.

<b>                    RICKY

He heads into the hall. The Colonel watches him go, uneasy.

The Colonel rinses off his plate at the sink. Something
outside catches his eye, and he cranes his neck to get a
better look at...

His POV: Through the window over the sink, we can see into
the Burnham's GARAGE WINDOW. Our view is blurred by the RAIN,
but we see Lester, his upper body pumped and glistening in
sweat as he counts out a wad of BILLS... and then Ricky walks
into view.

The Colonel's face tightens.

His POV: Lester drapes his arm around Ricky as he gives him
the money. We can only see Lester from the waist up, so he
looks naked.

<b>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

Ricky, his hair wet from the rain, puts the cash in his
pocket. Lester's arm remains draped around his shoulder.

And he slaps Ricky playfully on the chest. Ricky grins, then
squats down and reaches under the weight bench.

<b>                    RICKY

<b>INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
The Colonel's POV: Lester leans back in his chair. We see
only Ricky's back and shoulders as he rolls the joint. After
a beat, Lester's jaw drops, then he throws his head back.
From our perspective, it looks very much like Ricky is giving
Lester a blow job.

The Colonel watches, incredulous. Then we HEAR a CAR
APPROACHING, and the Colonel glances over at:

His POV: Angela's BMW pulls into the driveway, stopping
behind Lester's Firebird. As Angela and Jane get out and run
toward the house, our focus MOVES back to the GARAGE WINDOW.
Ricky stands, looking a little panicked. Lester pulls on his
T-shirt, and both he and Ricky cross out of view.

<b>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Lester leans nonchalantly against the counter. Jane and
Angela enter. Jane frowns when she sees him.

Jane rolls her eyes and exits. Angela walks over to Lester.

<b>                    ANGELA

She places her hand on his arm flirtatiously, looks up at him

</b>          Do you want me to make you another one?

<b>                    ANGELA
</b>          No, no, no. I'm fine.

He turns to her and cocks an eyebrow.

<b>                    LESTER
</b>              (concerned)
          You sure?

<b>                    ANGELA
</b>          I mean, I'm still a little weirded out,
          but...
              (sincerely)
          ...I feel better. Thanks.

A long beat, as Lester studies her, then:

<b>                    LESTER
</b>          How's Jane?

<b>                    ANGELA
</b>          What do you mean?

<b>                    LESTER
</b>          I mean, how's her life? Is she happy? Is
          she miserable? I'd really like to know,
          and she'd die before she'd ever tell me
          about it.

<b>                                                    (CONTINUED)

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>

Angela shifts uncomfortably.

<b>                    ANGELA
</b>          She's... she's really happy. She thinks
          she's in love.

Angela rolls her eyes at how silly this notion is.

<b>                    LESTER
</b>              (quietly)
          Good for her.

An awkward beat.

<b>                    ANGELA
</b>          How are you?

<b>                     LESTER
</b>              (smiles, taken aback)
          God, it's been a long time since anybody
          asked me that.
              (thinks about it)
          I'm great.

They just sit there, smiling at each other, then:

<b>                    ANGELA
</b>              (suddenly)
          I've gotta go to the bathroom.

She crosses off. Lester watches her go, then stands there
wondering why he should suddenly feel so content.

<b>                     LESTER
</b>              (laughs)
          I'm great.

Something at the edge of the counter catches his eye, and he
reaches for...

CLOSE on a framed PHOTOGRAPH as he picks it up: It's the
photo we saw earlier of him, Carolyn and Jane, taken several
years ago at an amusement park. It's startling how happy they
look.

Lester crosses to the kitchen table, where he sits and
studies the photo. He suddenly seems older, more mature...
and then he smiles: the deep, satisfied smile of a man who
just now understands the punch line of a joke he heard long
ago...

<b>                    LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>          Man oh man...
              (softly)
          Man oh man oh man...

After a beat, the barrel of a GUN rises up behind his head,
aimed at the base of his skull.

ANGLE ON an arrangement of fresh-cut ROSES   in a vase on the
opposite counter, deep crimson against the   WHITE TILE WALL.
Then a GUNSHOT suddenly rings out, ECHOING   unnaturally.
Instantly, the tile is sprayed with BLOOD,   the same deep
crimson as the roses.

<b>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Ricky comes down the stairs, followed by Jane.

<b>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Ricky opens the door from the dining room, then stops. Jane
appears behind him.

<b>                       JANE
</b>          Oh God.

Their POV: A pool of blood is forming on the kitchen table.

Ricky comes into the kitchen and slowly approaches Lester's
lifeless body, wide-eyed but not afraid. Jane follows him, in
shock. Ricky kneels, gazing at Lester's unseen face... then
he smiles, ever so slightly.

His POV: Lester looks back at us; his eyes are lifeless, but
he's smiling the same slight smile.

<b>                       RICKY
</b>                 (an awed whisper)
          Wow.

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.)
</b>          I had always heard your entire life
          flashes in front of your eyes the second
          before you die.

<b>EXT. SKY - DAY
</b>
We're FLYING across a white blanket of clouds.

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.)
</b>          First of all, that one second isn't a
          second at all, it stretches on forever,
          like an ocean of time...

</b><b>                                                           98.

<b>EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
</b>
In BLACK &amp; WHITE: Eleven-year-old Lester looks up, pointing
excitedly at:

His POV: A DOT OF LIGHT falls across an unbelievably starry
sky.

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.)
</b>          For me, it was lying on my back at Boy
          Scout camp, watching falling stars...

<b>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Ricky and Jane lie curled up on Jane's bed, fully clothed. We
HEAR a GUNSHOT from downstairs. They look at each other,
alarmed.

<b>EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DUSK
</b>
In BLACK &amp; WHITE: Maple trees in autumn. Ghostly LEAVES
FLUTTER slowly toward pavement.

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.)
</b>          And yellow leaves, from the maple trees,
          that lined my street...

<b>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - POWDER ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Angela stands in front of the mirror, fixing her make-up. We
HEAR the GUNSHOT again. Angela turns, frightened.

<b>INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY
</b>
In BLACK &amp; WHITE: CLOSE on an ancient woman's papery HANDS as
they button a cardigan sweater.

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.)
</b>          Or my grandmother's hands, and the way
          her skin seemed like paper...

<b>EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
Carolyn walks slowly toward the RED DOOR, drenched to the
bone, clutching her PURSE tightly. We HEAR the GUNSHOT again.

<b>EXT. SUBURB - DAY
</b>
In BLACK &amp; WHITE: A 1970 PONTIAC FIREBIRD in the driveway of
a suburban home. The SUN'S REFLECTION in the windshield
<b>FLASHES BRILLIANTLY.

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.)
</b>          And the first time I saw my cousin Tony's
          brand new Firebird...

<b>INT. FITTS HOUSE - THE COLONEL'S STUDY - NIGHT
</b>
The Colonel enters, wet. He's wearing LATEX GLOVES. BLOOD
covers the front of his T-shirt. He paces in front of one of
his GUN CASES; the GLASS DOOR is open, and a gun is
conspicuously missing from inside.

<b>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT
</b>
In BLACK &amp; WHITE: Jane opens her bedroom door, staring at us.

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.)
</b>          And Janie...

<b>EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DUSK
</b>
In BLACK &amp; WHITE: A door opens to reveal 4-YEAR-OLD JANE,
dressed for Halloween in a Princess costume, holding a lit
SPARKLER aloft and smiling shyly at us.

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.)
</b>          And Janie...

<b>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Carolyn enters, terrified, still clutching her PURSE. She
shuts the door and locks it, then takes the GLOCK 19 out of
her purse. She opens the closet door and shoves the gun into
a HAMPER. Then, suddenly aware of Lester's scent, she grabs
as many of his clothes as she can and pulls them to her,
burying her face in them. She sinks to her knees, pulling
several items of clothing down with her, and she begins to
cry.

<b>EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT
</b>
<b>                                              IN BLACK &amp; WHITE:
</b>
A younger Carolyn sits across from us in one of those
SPINNING-TEACUP RIDES, LAUGHING uncontrollably as she twists
the wheel in front of her, making us SPIN even faster.

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.)
</b>              (with love)
          And... Carolyn.

</b>


<b>EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
</b>
On VIDEO: We're watching the video Ricky showed Jane earlier,
of the empty white PLASTIC BAG being blown about. The wind
carries it in a circle around us, sometimes whipping it about
violently, or, without warning, sending it soaring skyward,
then letting it float gracefully down to the ground...

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.)
</b>          I guess I could be pretty pissed off
          about what happened to me... but it's
          hard to stay mad, when there's so much
          beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel
          like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's
          too much, my heart fills up like a
          balloon that's about to burst...

<b>EXT. - ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - DAY
</b>
We're FLYING once again over Robin Hood Trail, ASCENDING
<b>SLOWLY.
</b>
<b>                    LESTER (V.O.)
</b>          ...and then I remember to relax, and stop
          trying to hold on to it, and then it
          flows through me like rain and I can't
          feel anything but gratitude for every
          single moment of my stupid little life...
              (amused)
          You have no idea what I'm talking about,
          I'm sure. But don't worry...

<b>                                               FADE TO BLACK.
