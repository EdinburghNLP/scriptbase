<b>               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN, NORTH CAROLINA. DAY
</b>
               ON A BLACK SCREEN: Credits.

<b>               A RAUCOUS VOICE (SWIMMER’S) CHANTING IN THE CHEROKEE LANGUAGE.
</b>
               A RANGE OF MOUNTAINS SLOWLY EMERGES: shrouded in a blue mist 
               like a Chinese water color. Below them, close to a small 
               town, YOUNG MEN, armed with vicious sticks and stripped to 
               the waist, come charging in a muscular, steaming pack.

               Their opponents, also swinging sticks, attach the pack.

               A ball, barely round, made of leather, emerges, smacked 
               forwards by INMAN, who hurtles after it and collides with a 
               stick swung by SWIMMER, a young and lithe American Indian. 
               Inman falls, clutching his nose. The ball bobbles on the 
               ground in front of him. He grabs it and gets to his feet, 
               the blood pouring from his nose.

               His team form a phalanx around him and he continues to charge.

               A PRISTINE CABRIOLET pulled by an impressive horse, comes 
               down towards the town. It has to pass across the temporary 
               field of play, parting the teams. Some of the contestants 
               grab their shirts to restore propriety as the Cabriolet and 
               its two exotic passengers passes by.

               The driver is a man in his early fifties, dressed in the 
               severe garb of a minister, MONROE. And next to him, a self-
               conscious girl in the spotless elaborate, architectural skirts 
               of the period, is his daughter, ADA. Inman, using his shirt 
               to staunch his battered nose, looks at Ada, astonished by 
               her. An angel in this wild place.

               Now Swimmer stops chanting and begins, more hesitantly, to 
               translate into English:

<b>                                     SWIMMER’S VOICE (V.O.)
</b>                         You will be lonely. You will howl 
                         like a dog as you walk alone. You 
                         will carry dog shit cupped in your 
                         hands. You will be smeared with dog 
                         shit. Your spirit will wane and 
                         dwindle to blue, the colour of 
                         despair... 

               As the Cabriolet passes, SWIMMER takes the ball an with a 
               whoop starts to run towards the opposing goal. The game 
               resumes. Ada looks back as the men swarm into each other, 
               sticks and fists flailing.

<b>               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. NIGHT
</b>
               A SIDE OF BEEF turns on a huge barbecue. The battered teams 
               eating, drinking hard liquor, rehearsing victory and defeat, 
               illuminated by a roaring bonfire. Swimmer is sewing up a 
               gash in Inman’s cheek as he continues to translate:

<b>                                     SWIMMER
</b>                         ...This is your path. There is no 
                         other. That's a curse you can use on 
                         the Yankee before battle.

<b>                                     INMAN
</b>                         And that works?

<b>                                     SWIMMER
</b>                         You have to say it in Cherokee.

<b>                                     INMAN
</b>                         You said it to me in Cherokee.

               During this, Monroe and Ada have arrived, escorted by SALLY 
               SWANGER, a local woman, middle-aged, kindly, and her husband, 
               ESCO, a glorious curmudgeon. The Monroes are introduced to 
               various locals. Inamn watches them, on the other side of the 
               crowd. The Reverend Monroe, his daughter Ada. Up from 
               Charleston, bringing God's word to you heathens! Is Esco's 
               preferred introduction. Building a church. Inman watches 
               Ada, moves his head to keep her in view as Swimmer stitches, 
               and winces with pain.

<b>                                     SWIMMER
</b>                         So keep your head still.

               Sally collects plates for the Monroes. Hands them to Ada and 
               her father, who wait, patiently, for silverware. Esco takes 
               a plate, picks up a skewer of meat, bites on it. Monroe 
               pluckily follows suit.

<b>                                     INMAN
</b>                              (to Swimmer)
                         Anyway, there won't be any war. And 
                         if there is, they say it won't last 
                         a week.

<b>               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. PREDAWN
</b>
<b>               CAPTION: PETERSBURG, VIRGINIA. JULY 30TH, 1864. IN THE FOURTH 
</b><b>               YEAR OF THE CIVIL WAR.
</b>
               A STAND OF TREES. The pastoral lush green Virginia. A RABBIT 
               surfaces from its hole. Peace and beauty.

               A second RABBIT shakes itself from the ground, darts into 
               open ground to confront the FORBIDDING TRENCHES OF THE 
<b>               CONFEDERATE AND UNION ARMIES, RANGED AGAINST EACH OTHER ON 
</b>               THE OUTSKIRTS OF PETERSBURG. Massive wooden barricades in 
               the shape of crosses, rows of X's, define the two lines. The 
               Federals have been laying siege for months. So early and 
               it's already hot. The trees are an oasis of green in a world 
               of mud between the two stark and ugly scars of the trenches.

               IN THE CONFEDERATE LINES, the men are rousing, boiling water 
               for coffee or to shave, smoking, stiff from night. There's a 
               large gun emplacement and some men still sleep against the 
               stub-nosed cannon. Another RABBIT is disturbed from its hole. 
               Ears pricked up to a distant rumbling.

<b>               INT. TUNNEL. PREDAWN.
</b>
               A dark hole. Some evil place. A scraping sound. Shapes 
               burrowing forwards at a crouch. A silent purpose.

<b>               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. PREDAWN.
</b>
               Young OAKLEY, freshly recruited, approaches a group of men, 
               like him Highlanders from Company F of the 25th North Carolina 
               Regiment. He doles out breakfast. Inman, loading his heavy 
               LeMats pistol, its nine rounds, is not hungry. Oakley serves 
               another, ROURKE, last seen in the scrum at Cold Mountain. 
               Oakley keeps his head low as he serves.

<b>                                     ROURKE
</b>                         Don't worry, son. Those Yankee boys 
                         keep store hours. They ain't open 
                         yet.

<b>               INT. TUNNEL. PREDAWN
</b>
               Shadows and shapes. A BARREL rumbles along the tunnel. It 
               reaches a kneeling figure, who rolls it forwards. A relay 
               team. At the end of the tunnel, where it widens, a man, naked 
               to the waist, crouches, stacking the barrels.

<b>               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. PREDAWN
</b>
               A RABBIT, scared up, darts along the trench. Rourke sees it, 
               beckons to another Cold Mountain boy, Butcher.

<b>                                     BUTCHER
</b>                         That's fresh breakfast. Shoot him!

<b>                                     ROURKE
</b>                         I'm not firing, start the damn war 
                         off.

               Butcher chases after the rabbit, Rourke in raucous support.

<b>               INT. TUNNEL. PREDAWN
</b>
               The crouching man has wrapped FUZE WIRE around the last 
               barrel, and now retreats, paying out the wire as he does so, 
               as each man in the tunnel crawls backwards behind him.

<b>               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. DAWN
</b>
               Rourke weaves through the gun emplacements, laughing.

<b>                                     ROURKE
</b>                         That's my rabbit!

               Great sport. Inman, fifty yards away, looks over, amused, 
               goes back to his gun.

<b>               INT. TUNNEL. DAWN

               The fuze wire is lit. It fizzes towards the barrels.

               Rourke is running BUT NOW THE GROUND BUCKLES UNDER HIM AND 
               HE'S BEING LIFTED SLOWLY INTO THE AIR, the earth swelling.

<b>               AN APOCALYPTIC EXPLOSION. FOUR TONS OF DYNAMITE RIP THE GROUND 
</b><b>               OPEN IN A CRATER 135 FEET LONG, 90 FEET ACROSS, 30 FEET DEEP.

</b>
<b>               INMAN DISAPPEARS UNDER DIRT AND DEBRIS.
</b>
               Pandemonium. The Confederates are in complete disarray. The 
               Federals pour forwards across NO MANS LAND, through the 
               peaceful oasis of trees, roaring the roar of attack. They 
               flood towards the crater, hundreds of them, charging into a 
               dense and impenetrable WALL OF SMOKE.

<b>               THEN THEY'RE INSIDE THE GREAT GASH OF CRATER AND CAN'T GET 
</b>               OUT AGAIN, arriving at an insurmountable wall of mud.

               The Confederates regroup. Orders are yelled. Chaos developing 
               into battle.

               The Confederates begin firing into the crater. Guns and mortar 
               wheel round and empty into what is becoming a terrible death 
               trap.

               Inman gets to his feet. Oakley with him, and rushes through 
               the smoke to the pit, emptying his LeMats into the crater.

               LATER: A BLACK REGIMENT from the Union join the attack. Bodies 
               falling on bodies as the Federals charge in and pack their 
               comrades even tighter. The Confederates make a pincer movement 
               outside the Crater, forcing all the Federals in. It's 
               Medieval.

               No escape.

               THE CONFEDERATES jump into the pit to engage the Federals. 
               Hand to hand fighting. Too close for rifles, just bayonets, 
               and guns swung like clubs and Inman sliding down into that 
               hell, tiring the nine rounds, then the shotgun charge, which 
               does a terrible damage. Primitive. Unutterable carnage. Men 
               killing each other in embraces, soldier crushed against 
               soldier, desperate to survive, to kill, to live. An oozing 
               layer cake of bodies, dead and frantically alive, drowning 
               in slick.

               YOUNG OAKLEY loses his rifle and picks up a magazine case, 
               clubbing his opponent, then slips onto him and is stuck with 
               a bayonet, the pain of which makes him squeal.

               INMAN GOES AT IT. He's a warrior, punching and stabbing and 
               firing. A coldly efficient killer. He's grabbed from behind 
               and crushed, a hand gouging at his face, an almighty struggle.

               He falls and lands on top of Oakley, and he and his Federal 
               opponent fight to the death with the wounded boy as their 
               pillow. The slaughter continues over and around them, the 
               sound, the sound of hell and madness. The boy has his arm 
               around Inman, like lovers.

               LATER: The Confederates run after the retreating Union 
               soldiers, firing, cavalry riding them down. Inman stands, 
               the boy's blood all over him, exhausted and appalled. The 
               crater, behind him, an abattoir of men. The victors are 
               yelling, pumped mad with adrenaline. Butcher comes alongside 
               Inman.

<b>                                     BUTCHER

                         asshole.

               A WOUNDED BLACK SOLDIER sits up as Butcher celebrates.

               Butcher runs over, but can't find a charge for his musket. 
               He looks around in the stack of corpses, pulling out weapons,

               tries one: not loaded, throws it down, tries another: not 
               loaded. The wounded man can't get up, tries to drag himself 
               like a crab away from Butcher. Inman yells at him, appalled.

<b>                                     BUTCHER

               He picks up another musket. It fires. The wounded Federal 
               slumps back, dead.

<b>               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. DUSK

               THE AFTERMATH. The dead being piled up for burial, divided 
               into allegiance. Wounded prisoners able to walk are led away.

               A great deal of casual looting. Of boots, of equipment, of 
               personal items. Inman sees a soldier in the crater, lining 
               up wounded Federals, putting their heads in a row. THE MAN 
<b>               EXTRACTS A HAMMER FROM HIS BELT AND, SATISFIED HE HAS AN

</b>
               Inman turns away, sees another Rebel, extravagantly costumed, 
               a strange FIDDLE head protruding from his knapsack. This is 
               STOBROD THEWES. He's bent over a dead Federal, examining his 
               mouth. He reaches behind his back and roots around in the 
               knapsack, producing A PAIR OF PLIERS, WHICH HE INSERTS INTO 
               THE CORPSE'S MOUTH. He's yanking away when A SWINGING BOOT 
               connects with his head and knocks him to the ground.

               Startled, he looks up to see Inman hovering over him.

<b>                                     STOBROD

                         We take his boots.

               He examines his fiddle for damage. Some orderlies pass, 
               lifting OAKLEY away on a gurney.

               Oakley's pale as a maiden, the life leaking from him. Inman 
               walks a way with him. Oakley looks up, desperate to be brave.

                              (Inman finds this 
                              incredible)
                         It's okay. I was thirteen when you 
                         all left. Am I going to die?

               Inman flicks his eyes to the Orderly, whose look confirms 
               the boy's wounds are certainly mortal.

<b>               INT. FIELD HOSPITAL. NIGHT
</b>
               Inman sits on the ground beside Oakley's cot. Around them, 
               the wounded are certainly dying, makeshift care, oil lights, 
               groans.

<b>               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. NIGHT

               Inman walks around the campfires. He hears some fiddle music. 
               It's Stobrod.

               Stobrod sees Inman. Inman stares, his expression an 
               instruction, the turns and walks away.

<b>               INT. FIELD HOSPITAL. NIGHT

               Stobrod stands over Oakley. Consults with Inman.

               Stobrod looks at Inman, confused.

                         cool.

               Inman glares at Stobrod. And Stobrod starts to play.

               Hesitant, then with gathering confidence, improvising, 
               increasingly expansive, as if he's as surprised as everyone 
               else. Oakley's lips move. A whisper. Inman leans in.

                         you.

               Stobrod plays. It's wrenching. Oakley stills. Inman abruptly 
               puts his hand on the neck of the fiddle, stopping Stobrod. 
               The boy is dead. Inman gets to his feet and walks away.

<b>               INT. CONFEDERATE TENT. NIGHT

               A dozen men in the tent. Inman has a BOOK, its cover gone, 
               rolled up and tied with a leather strap. His bookmark is A 
               FADED TINTYPE PHOTOGRAPH of a solemn young woman. He unwraps 
               the book carefully and reads a page by the sickly light next 
               to his bedroll. An OFFICER comes into the tent, approaches 
               Inman, who makes a stand.

                         dozen Yankees in that stand of trees 
                         between us. Stuck there from the 
                         retreat. Come daylight they can shoot 
                         us down for sport.

<b>               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. NIGHT
</b>
               A beautiful night. Lots of stars. Inman and three others, 
               including Butcher, slide over the top of the trench, far to 
               one side of the stand of trees. The plan is to cast a wide 
               arc that will bring them around back of the trees, closer to 
               the enemy side than their own. The four men slither over the 
               ground. They pause. Inman has arrived at a tangle of corpses.

               He slithers over them.

               They work their way towards the trees. THERE ARE A HALF DOZEN 
               FEDERALS CROUCHING IN THE COVER OF THE TREES. They are dozing. 
               Only one of them sits with a rifle surveying the Confederate 
               lines, the others have their backs to the enemy, sitting 
               against the trunks, grabbing a few minute's sleep.

               As the four rebels approach, still crawling, one of the 
               Federals opens his eyes, sees the attack, shifts for his 
               rifle. INMAN IMMEDIATELY STANDS UP, FIRING INSTANTLY, killing 
               him and two others, while Butcher throws himself at another.

               The exchanges are brief and savage and one of Inman's party 
               and all of the Federals lay dead. Then the rebels break from 
               the trees.

               A FLARE goes up, then another, both from the Confederate 
               trenches. INMAN AND HIS ACCOMPLICES ARE PICKED OUT IN A 
               BRILLIANT GREEN LIGHT. Shots follow, from both sides, aimed 
               at the three returning men as they zigzag towards their own 
               lines. As they get close, voices cry out, rippling down the 
               trench, joining their own admonitions: Don't shoot, Hold 
               your fire, they're our boys, Hold your fire!!! They're almost 
               home. Butcher is laughing, whooping. Then just as suddenly 
               he falls, wounded. Inman stops, turns back, runs to him.

               Inman collects Butcher, drags him, carries him. They're fifty 
               yards from their lines. A BULLET CATCHES INMAN IN THE NECK.

               He goes down like a tree, blood pouring from his neck. Lying 
               on the ground, he watches the phosphorescent lights slowly 
               fade to black, all sound fading with them.

<b>               EXT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. 3 YEARS EARLIER. DAY

               A WOODEN JOIST swings across the view of the Blue Ridge. Men 
               are swarming over the roof of an unfinished CHAPEL, below 
               which appears the small town of COLD MOUNTAIN. Among the 
               workers, armed with nails and hammer, knees clutching a 
               rafter, is Inman, fresh and a whole lifetime younger. Rourke 
               and Butcher are also there hammering, building, kidding around 
               and Oakley, barely a teenager.

               Below them, women are setting up a lunch for the workers, 
               ADA amongst them. She has the circumspect air of the blue 
               stocking, uncomfortably aware of the dirt beneath her hem, 
               the men's radar for her every move. Inman watches her as

               Monroe and Inman and Ada touring the farm. It's a biggish 
               property, over three hundred acres. And well-tended by the 
               dozen slave farmhands who work it, some of whom are dotted 
               about in the landscape. Rolling mountains dominate the view.

               Ada walking behind, comes alongside the two men, threading 
               her arm into her father's but, by so doing, also arriving 
               next to Inman.

               From the window Ada watches the Cabriolet head towards town.

               At the piano, she unwraps the leather lace from the package 
               of music. Inside the first book of music, there's a 
               DAGUERREOTYPE OF INMAN with his LeMats, a typical Confederate 
               pose. Some of the music has left its imprint on the picture, 
               the notes like a melody over Inman's face. Ada picks them 
               out on the piano.

               The ebullient sound of Shape Singing. A noisy choir letting 
               rip --

               Ada. He fixes on her neck, the way the hair falls.

               The door bursts open. Young OAKLEY, apologetic nod to Monroe, 
               sits at the back, then leans forward, as the singing 
               continues, to say something to Rourke, who says something to 
               Butcher, the news spreading like wildfire. Rourke gets up, 
               leaves. Butcher gets up next, follows. Another man. Another.

               Depleting the male voices, until only women and some of the 
               older men are singing and one side of the church is 
               practically empty.

               Those left in the congregation now spill out into what has 
               become a melee as the NEWS OF SECESSION goes up. Enormous 
               excitement, particularly among the boys, who now seem 
               curiously attractive to the girls. Inman blinks out into the

               behind, riding on over the ridge. Inman walks to Ada.

               get to the point of declaration but don't know how. They 
               stand, people noisy around them, those about to leave, those

               He's polishing his boots, in his bare feet. One hand inside 
               the boot, the other blacking it. There's a knock at the door.

               INMAN lies; bandaged, eyes closed, in THE BALLROOM OF A 
               COLONIAL MANSION, co-opted as one ward of a Confederate 
               hospital. Rows of beds, the wounded and the dying, are lodged 
               between some vestiges of the room's former glory.

               SOME LOCAL WOMEN, conscious of their duty to the cause, are 
               brought through by an exhausted doctor, who's lost all his 
               grace. The windows are open, but it's still insufferably 
               hot, the muslin curtains barely moving.

                         by nightfall. I have other men outside 
                         in the quadrangle waiting for the

               The Doctor shrugs, not a detective, moves on, stops at the 
               man in the next bed. Has a brief look, calls to a nurse.

               Ada emerges, almost collides with Teague. She wriggles past 
               him, tries to make her package invisible.

<b>               EXT. APPROACH TO BLACK COVE FARM - DAY
</b>
               IT'S WINTER. A solitary RIDER jogs his horse through the 
               frost, towards Black Cove farm.

               Ada is working at a handpump, failing to coax water from the 
               well. She's wrapped in blankets. The farm is somewhat unkempt 
               and so is she. The hem of her skirt is frayed. She rips at 
               it tearing off a strip of material, which she binds around 
               the handle in an attempt to thaw the mechanism. Then she 
               looks up to see the horseman approaching. It's Teague. Ada 
               immediately heads inside the house.

               Teague arrives at the house, takes a brace of RABBITS from 
               his saddlebag. He heads for the gate. The gate needs oiling, 
               the path is overgrown, he looks at the pump handle, the 
               abandoned pitcher.

               Ada opens the door, pinning her hair.

               Ada comes into the kitchen. A weak oil-lamp reveals THE TWO

               them, a little liquid leaking from them. Ada takes a knife

               Ada enters her bedroom. It's a chaos of books, clothes,

               Then drags her armchair up against that, books and papers 
               spilling onto the floor. She props up Inman's portrait, on,

               desolate, begins to write:

               THERAPY FOR WOUNDED SOLDIERS. Some of those convalescing 
               swim or are helped to paddle in the healing sea. There are 
               rudimentary wheelchairs. Inman, a long way from home, is 
               amongst those sitting in one of these, very still, grey and 
               sick -- but alive. He pulls at the dressing on his neck, 
               exposing the still raw and livid wound to the sea air.

               Inman has his Bartram, his bookmark is the battered and foxed 
               picture of Ada, which he considers, before continuing to 
               read.

               Behind him A HUNDRED SLAVES AT WORK IN THE FIELDS, and behind 
               them the Mansion which has become the hospital. A series of 
               bells, of shouts, and the slaves stop working, prepare for 
               the long walk home, congregating, then forming a line, herded 
               by the foremen.

               Inman eases his position to bend over and dip his bandage in 
               the seawater. He brings the wet bandage to his neck, considers 
               the ocean, his fellow ragtag of wounded, the slaves, the 
               great fields, the Mansion. The whole meaning of this war

               EVERYWHERE SIGNS OF PROFOUND NEGLECT, like a Grimm's fairy 
               tale of a deserted house. The fields are overgrown with weeds, 
               the gardens abandoned. The chickens have deserted the henhouse 
               and are wandering around the outbuildings, scuffing at the 
               packed dirt.

               Sally and Esco come up the overgrown path, avoiding the 
               chickens, and knock at the door.

               They're seen from ground level, through a boxwood, as their 
               feet patrol the ground, turn away from the door, and then 
               retreat, their voices drifting away. Ada is there, crouching 
               in her hidey-hole, a blanket on the ground, her book. She 
               wants to reveal herself, but is too embarrassed.

               During this a ROOSTER, black and gold, struts into the 
               boxwood. As the rooster approaches, Ada shudders, tries to 
               shoo it away without alerting her presence. Ada peers through 
               the boxwood as Sally and Esco close the gate and recede. The 
               rooster comes at her again. She rises up, kicking out at it, 
               while he flares his wings, spurs flaying at her. Ada runs 
               from the boxwood, tormented by the triumphant rooster, which 
               continues to fly and scratch, driving her into the house.

               the sleeves, catches her pinched face and disheveled face in

               Inman and a bunch of other walking wounded make their way, 
               under supervision, towards the town. The grandeur of the

               TWO GREAT TRESTLE TABLES, LOADED WITH CLOTHES. Underneath

               soldiers, some of whom are still on crutches, or in 
               wheelchairs. Inman finds a black dresscoat, some pants, a

               AN ELDERLY AND STAUNCH CONFEDERATE GENTLEMAN shakes his hand

               her shoulders. He turns to Inman.

<b>               EXT. SUNKEN FOREST. DAY
</b>
               Inman finds himself in A SUNKEN FOREST OF PINE. He moves 
               warily, his beard longer, his figure gaunt, his clothes 
               weathering to a uniform smudge of charcoal.

               He hears DOGS BARKING IN THE DISTANCE, FAINT SHOUTS. He picks 
               up his pace, skirts round the swampy lake.

<b>               EXT. CAPE FEAR RIVER. DUSK
</b>
               Inman comes to the bank of a HUGE RIVER. The water, as the 
               light begins to go, is the color of mud, with bubbles, 
               belching to the surface, full of ugly prominent. Inman is 
               almost jogging now, an ear tracking his still distant 
               pursuers. The river is too wide to contemplate swimming and 
               now it begins to curve left, forcing him -- against his 
               judgment, to circle back. He approaches A SMALL JETTY.

               A sign: Ferry $5. Yell Loud.

               On the far bank there's A CABIN ON STILTS above the highwater 
               mark. Inman calls out, reluctantly, his voice still a kind 
               of growl. Then again.

               A TINY FIGURE steps out of the cabin and waves before jumping 
               into a small canoe. The canoe heads against the current, the 
               rower's back bent with the effort. As the canoe approaches, 
               Inman sees that the ferryman is, in fact, A YOUNG GIRL, not 
               eighteen. She doesn't look at him. He produces five dollars. 
               She eyes the bill with contempt.

               A dog barks in the distance. Getting closer. Inman turns to 
               the sound. The Ferrygirl is well aware of her leverage.

               Inman is astonished to see VEASEY stumble out of the trees. 
               His head is shaved, his face bruised and swollen, his clothes 
               castoffs and ill-fitting, cinched at the waist with rope. He 
               stumbles towards Inman, urging him to get on with the journey.

                         the chance.

               Shouts, more barking. Inman jumps in the canoe, and they're 
               off. The Ferrygirl turns the boat around, rows them away 
               from the jetty with the grace of someone doing something for 
               the thousandth time.

               Inman sits, scouring the bank for sign of his pursuers. The 
               sun is sinking fast.

               A sharp sound, a tiny thwack of ball on meat. The Ferrygirl 
               SUDDENLY SLUMPS BACK and falls into the water.

               Veasey grabs out at the oar, but it goes, too. The girl sinks 
               quickly, A BLOODY GAP to the side of her head. Inman, on his 
               knees and stretching, can't help her. Then a second noise as 
               A HOLE THE SIZE OF A FIST appears in the canoe, just at 
               waterlevel. Water pours into the canoe. Dogs bark, and now 
               FIGURES are visible at the jetty. HOME GUARD. One of them 
               has a sniper's rifle and is loading for a third shot. Inman 
               can see him sighting the rifle. They lie flat in the canoe.

               ANOTHER GREAT FIST OF WOOD is gouged out. Now the boat is 
               almost full of water. Veasey spits out a foul mouthful. INMAN 
               ROCKS THE CANOE AND LETS IT TURN OVER ONTO THEM, Veasey 
               surfaces from under it, clutching the wood as a raft, but 
               the canoe CATCHES INMAN A BLOW TO HIS HEAD and he sinks. 
               Veasey hauls him to the surface and, surprisingly strong, 
               holds him with one fist, the boat with the other, lets the 
               current take them, pulling them under, then up, under, then 
               up, but clinging on, as the rifle continues to deliver its 
               assault, another shot into the boat, another into the water 
               near to Veasey's arm.

               THE GIRL'S BODY comes by them, carried by the river, the 
               dress billowing out almost covering her head. The sun has 
               gone, the light fading, the canoe sliding downriver away 
               from their aggressors.

<b>               EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CAPE FEAR. NIGHT
</b>
               In the moonlight, the canoe drifts into the muddy bank and 
               Veasey drags a half-drowned Inman to land, both of them 
               retching with the vile river water. AN ALLIGATOR eases into 
               the river not ten feet from where they lie, lungs heaving. 
               They get up. Veasey to his feet, Inman to his knees.

               Inman nods, coughs. And Veasey AIMS A KICK at Inman's head, 
               knocking him back into the mud.

               And they begin to SAW OFF THE BULL'S NECK.

               LATER, and they're in A VILE STEW OF BLOOD AND INNARDS. The 
               stomach opens and its contents gush into the creek. Veasey 
               is disgusted, draws back. The two other men haul up the rest

               Junior, Inman and Veasey come around a bend and there's A 
               BIG CABIN LOOMING. It's in such poor repair that one end has 
               slipped from the stones which serve as it's foundation and 
               STANDS BADLY TILTED OVER. Junior roots up another hidden jug 
               of liquor, which he drinks from, then hands to Veasey.

                         her three so-called sisters and their

               No real furniture. Veasey is shaving. Inman stows his knapsack 
               behind the woodburning stove, on which a big kettle of boiling 
               water steams away. Then he gets in the tub, his back to the 
               door.

               Shyla comes in, brings the kettle over to the tub, pours in 
               the steaming water. She appraises Inman. It's intensely

               LILA, JUNIOR'S WIFE, spoons out stew from a vast pot. The 
               table crammed with customers -- her three sisters, the three 
               men, the herd of dogs and filthy children. Nobody speaks. 
               Each time Lila bends over to spoon out of the pot, her 
               cleavage strains against the flimsy fabric of her dress. 
               Veasey's mesmerized. Inman is also getting drunk, his eyes 
               increasingly glazed. When Lila makes to sit down next to

               Shyla stays, Mae having gone off after Veasey. Lila waits 
               until the children have gone. They consider Inman supine by 
               the fire.

                         Gonna make him hug me till I grunt.

               Lila shepherds Shyla out, shuts the door, swigs from the 
               jug, walks over to Inman, then turns to the big table and 
               pushes pots and plates way down to one end to make a playing 
               field.

               Then she bends over the prostrate Inman.

               Inman is drunk, doesn't think he's awake. She takes her breast 
               to his mouth, and Inman suckles. Then she puts his hands 
               under the dress which rides up as his hands move between her 
               legs. She's naked.

               She's kneeling now, her dress hunched up around her middle, 
               working the front of Inman's pants. He's in a swoon, 
               surrendering to her, getting aroused, his hand cupping her

               As Lila turns, Junior KICKS HER violently in the head,

               The Home Guard ride, bent under their oilskins, as the rain 
               tips down. Between the horses, unprotected and drenched, 
               their prisoners trudge along the muddy path. Inman and Veasey 
               among them. Veasey has grown some beard.

               AN OLDER MAN COLLAPSES, lies where he falls, not moving.

               There's a domino effect and so Inman falls on top of him. He 
               picks himself up, then tries to pull up the older man. He 
               doesn't move.

               The horses plough on. Inman shouts to BROWN, the leader.

<b>               THE HOME GUARD ESCORT THE PRISONERS PAST VEASEY'S OLD CHURCH.

               More days have gone by and taken their toll on the prisoners, 
               Veasey and Inman are haggard and filthy and reduced. The 
               Home Guards stop for food, a wash, a break, chain the 
               prisoners to a horse rail.

               Citizens go by, Veasey knows them all. Some of them spit 
               contemptuously at the Deserters. None of them recognise 
               Veasey.

               Somebody walks by with a young child.

               Veasey looks at Inman.

               The child stops, looks without recognizing, is tugged away 
               from the chain gang by his mother. One of the other prisoners, 
               SHEFFIELD, leans in to Inman, his voice low.

                         shot again for some cause I don't 
                         believe in.

               A GROUP OF SLAVES ARE WALKING BY, CARRYING SACKS. One of the 
               women is pregnant. Veasey studies the group, sees the pregnant 
               woman, recognizes her.

               In daylight it's apparent that Rebecca is a real beauty. She 
               turns at the sound of her name, stops, is confused. She sees 
               Veasey and approaches, appalled at his condition.

               Rebecca, reluctant, rejoins the other slaves, walks away 
               with them, but then turns back to look at Veasey. She clearly 
               cares about him. And seeing her has somehow broken his heart.

               He turns away from Inman, towards Sheffield.

               THE CHAIN GANG TRUDGES DOWN THE TRACK, horses on either side 
               of them, steep banks forming a V for the railroad. A TRAIN 
               IS COMING. Brown rides up to the prisoners, herds them off 
               the track. The train approaches quite slowly -- the boxcars 
               full of wounded soldiers. Some of the Home Guard dismount, 
               take out pipes. The prisoners wait, one of them sits down.

               Sheffield says something to Veasey, who casually yanks up 
               the sitting prisoner. Inman suddenly understands what's going 
               to happen. The train is almost on them.

<b>                                     INMAN
</b>                         No!

               But it's too late. SHEFFIELD JERKS FORWARD IN FRONT OF THE 
               TRAIN, PULLING ALL THE OTHERS WITH HIM, their reluctance 
               tempered by the possibility of being crushed by the oncoming 
               train.

               SOMEHOW THE CHAIN GANG GETS ACROSS THE TRACK, stumbling and 
               chaotic, the chains yanking tight, then loose, the tight 
               causing a collapse, the loose a recovery.

               They run alongside the train, blocking themselves from the 
               fire of the Guard, Sheffield screaming tactics -- and then, 
               as the train starts to pull past them, they run up the bank, 
               now all as a unit scrambling to the steep summit.

<b>               ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRAIN THE HOME GUARD HAVE REMOUNTED 
</b>               THEIR HORSES AND ARE RIDING HARD ALONGSIDE IT. Then they 
               have sight of the escaping prisoners silhouetted at the top 
               of the bank like a line of paper dolls stretched out along 
               the ridge. Sheffield's yelling with adrenaline, Veasey joins 
               in, elated. One of the guards raises a rifle, steadies himself 
               on his horse, FIRES. He catches Veasey, who crumples, spinning 
               round and falling down the bank, until Inman uses all his 
               strength and practically lifts him in the air. The chain 
               recovers and works back up the bank.

               But then A SECOND BULLET catches another prisoner and this 
               time the effect is catastrophic -- THE WHOLE GANG JUST FLIPS 
               OVER AND PLUMMETS DOWN THE BANK. The Home Guard approach, 
               firing randomly at the bodies as they tumble into the ditch 
               by the side of the track. Until all movement ceases. Inman 
               has a wound to his head which bleeds profusely, almost 
               completely covering his face. Brown arrives, considers the 
               carnage.

               Ada is in Monroe's bedroom, looks out as Ruby goes off to 
               town, jugs of cider swung either side of the horse. Ada goes 
               over to Monroe's closet, pulls out some clothes.

               fixes on, pushing in a hat pin to secure it. She's made a 
               stern black thing and steps back to consider it.

               Horsemen come riding along the lane. It's Teague and his

               Ada looks out at the Winter Garden. From that distance it 
               really does look like her father out in the field, arms 
               outstretched as if waiting for her to run to him. She finds 
               it unbearable, her tears coming, runs out into the fields, 
               attacks the scarecrow, pulling off the hat, the clothes...

<b>               EXT. RAILROAD TRACK. MORNING

               THE SOUND OF TINY BELLS. A misty drizzle. A GOAT snuffles 
               around in the freshly turned dirt: A hand, pale and wet, 
               protrudes from the thin layer of earth covering the bodies 
               of the murdered Chain Gang.

               SOMETHING SHIFTS UNDER THE DIRT, breaking the surface. Inman 
               wedged under three or four corpses -- their limbs and chains 
               wrapped around him, has regained consciousness. He coughs, 
               can't breathe properly, tries to work himself some air, 
               spitting out dirt. He makes a noise to distract the goat, 
               rattling the chains. Inman rears up, the bodies slithering 
               off him, but even then the animal only retreats a yard or 
               two. VEASEY SLIDES FACE UP, A BULLET IN HIS FOREHEAD LIKE A 
               MYSTICAL THIRD EYE. Inman feels a surprising loss and 
               tenderness. He heaves again, groaning with the pain of new 
               and old wounds.

               vines and creepers. Inman tries to sit up. An old whiskered

               pushing back his hair to look at his wound, puts a finger to 
               the gash on his neck professional in her appraisal. Inman is

               He starts to fish out a tobacco pouch. Esco's gun swings up.

               Teague shows him the leather pouch, shrugs, starts to make a

               SALLY IS STILL PINNED UNDER THE FENCE POST. The noose around 
               her neck has been tied off to the post so that she can't

               She calls over a little goat. It ambles over affectionately 
               and nuzzles into her hand. She strokes it and scratches under 
               the chin. The creature gets increasingly tranquil.

               In a single motion she has a knife in her hand and has SLIT 
               THE THROAT OF THE GOAT, putting the bowl underneath its neck 
               to catch the blood, still stroking the goat, which blinks as

               pulls out what look like old cheroot stubs.

                         me to tears. Thing is I've been 
                         thinking -- those places belonged to 
                         people before us, to the Indian -- 
                         and he had a different name. What 
                         did he call Sorell Cove? How can a 
                         name not even the real name break 
                         your heart? It's her, she's the place 
                         I'm heading. And I hardly know her. 
                         So how can a person who's maybe not 
                         even a real person -- I don't know 
                         what I'm talking about -- I have to 
                         close my eyes...

               He slides off the stool and lays on the floor. Maddy goes 
               over to her cot and pulls off a blanket which she drapes 
               over him.

               Maddy is loading up Inman for his journey. She hands him a 
               bulging goatskin satchel.

</b>                         That's medicine and goatmeat. You're 
                         sick of both.

               She hands him an ancient flintlock pistol.

</b>                         And that's just for show, or -- if 
                         you can get close enough -- a wild 
                         turkey.

               She turns, abruptly, mingles in with her goats. Inman nods, 
               knows that she doesn't want a fuss, although he wants to 
               make one, and turns himself, heads away from the caravan.

               THE MUSIC CONTINUES. A TURKEY calls. And again.

               JUNIOR is hunting. He creeps through this clearing, eyes 
               peeled for the turkey, gun at the ready. His dog growls, and 
               he puts a hand over its mouth. He listens. Another call.

               Junior moves, without sound, in its direction, stops for 
               several seconds under a tree, listening. He looks up. INMAN 
<b>               IS PERCHED IN THE TREE. THE PISTOL FLASHES IN HIS HAND.

               THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Inman drags Junior's corpse in to the 
               yard. The dogs whine and slobber over the body. Inman goes 
               straight into the Smoke House.

</b>
               THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Inman reaches behind the stove and 
               retrieves his bag. He checks for the LeMats, for the Bartram, 
               opens it, locating the tintype of Ada, which he considers, 
               as the dogs howl outside, joined with another wailing.

<b>               EXT. JUNIOR'S CABIN. DAY
</b>
               THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Inman emerges with his bag, LeMats at 
               the ready. The women are all keening over the corpse, as it 
               a saint had passed away. Dogs, women all howling. A chicken 
               bobs in, investigates the glob of blood on Junior's skull.

               Inman walks away, doesn't look at the women, who don't look 
               at him.

               THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Ruby wakes up. Looks out of the window.

               Ada, also woken, comes into Ruby's room. STOBROD IS OUTSIDE 
               WITH PANGLE, VIOLIN AND BANJO. Ruby opens the window, 
               scowling. Stobrod beams, stops playing, holds up the food, 
               points at Pangle in his new coat. Pangle waves.

               WINTER SETTING IN. Inman, increasingly a stick figure in the 
               landscape, wasted and fragile, trudges along through fallen 
               leaves. He still limps from the leg irons. No shelter 
               anywhere. He unwraps a paper containing some scraps of goat 
               meat and corn bread. He walks and eats, fishes out a lozenge, 
               tries to swallow it, washes it down with a drink from his 
               flask. Opens the crock of salve and rubs the treacly grease 
               into his neck and ankle. The path splits. He doesn't know 
               which way to go, A CROW repeatedly caws off to the left and, 
               taking it as a sign, Inman goes in that direction.

               the bottom of the bed, as Ada goes to sleep.

               DRIVING RAIN. Inman shelters under a huge tree, whose split 
               trunk provides a mean shelter. He inserts himself into the 
               cleft of it, a black thing in a black tree, like a troll. He 
               stands, shivers, sodden, desolate.

<b>               EXT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT
</b>
               A LITTLE CABIN. Its lights coming through square windows 
               like a chinese lantern. Inman considers it, the risk versus 
               the shelter.

               The sleet still pelts down on him and he decides to approach.

               Closer he can hear a sound coming from the house. IT'S A 
<b>               BABY'S INCESSANT CRY. HE SEES A YOUNG WOMAN WALKING ROUND

               Inman knocks hard on the door. The light from the lamp goes 
               out, although the fire still gives the room a clear glow.

                         be on my way come morning.

               No answer. Inman accepts this as a rebuttal, and trudges 
               back towards the road.

               seen.

<b>               INT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT

               Inman enters the cabin. It's a single room. A big fire. The 
               baby on the bed, a rudimentary crib unoccupied next to it. 
               The woman is already at the little stove. She turns to him. 
               She's painfully beautiful. But sad and fragile. Inman, despite 
               himself, is mesmerized.

               He turns it handle forwards and offers it to her.

                         wound at Fredericksburg. Never saw 
                         his boy.

               She never once looks at him. Her eyes on the floor or the 
               food or the baby.

               She hands him a plate of steaming beans. An onion perched on 
               top.

               She goes over to the bed and picks up her baby and starts 
               the same business of walking him, singing the while, an odd 
               lament. Inman eats, looks at her, at the child and the fire.

               He picks up the onion, bites into it. Sara looks across.

               Inman, embarrassed, turns his back to her. He sits finishing 
               the food while she puts the baby to her breast, slipping the 
               shoulder from her dress. While the baby feeds.

               Sara walks ahead of Inman. She carries a pile of clothing, a 
               pair of boots. It's still wretched outside, she hugs the 
               house, the porch barely offering shelter. INMAN FOLLOWS, 
               with a bowl of steaming water and a small towel over his

               There's a palpable attraction between them, so that every 
               exchange seems to contain a promise, a sexual charge.

               By the dim light, Inman peels off his clothes, sets to work 
               with the bar of soap and the cloth to scrub himself clean. 
               He can be seen from the window and finds himself turning

               She stands in a shift, a blanket over her shoulders. Her 
               body under the cotton very clear to him. She turns and goes 
               back inside.

               Inman comes in. Sara is sitting on her bed. Long silence.

               He sits on the bed as she slips under the covers, and then 
               removes the boots, his shirt, gets under the covers. There's 
               an electric space between them. Then Sara begins to cry, 
               pulls his arm to open up so that she can be folded into him.

               THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Stobrod is playing the fiddle, his bowing 
               hand still lightly taped and a fingerless mitten covering 
               it. They're in the abandoned Mill, a derelict space, which 
               has been cheered up with some rudimentary Christmas 
               decorations. Ada, Ruby and Sally Swanger, her hair now almost 
               completely white. Some token presents. Pangle is picking at 
               a banjo, his grin infectious, and a third player, GEORGIA, 
               with a harmonica. As they play:

                         Hey Ruby: what about this?

               He starts the tune of Wayfaring Stranger. Ruby groans.

               And he starts up again, but this time GEORGIA BEGINS TO SING.

               He's like a pale angel and sings with a soft, true voice.

               Ruby finds herself taken by this boy's voice and by Stobrod's 
               extraordinary invention as he takes the tune off on a wild 
               journey. Ruby sits next to Ada, fiddles with her bracelets, 
               slips one from Ada's wrist and slides it over her own.

               Sara, dressed, agitated -- the baby already complaining --

                         here it'll go bad on all of us.

               Inman is up, grabbing clothes, boots, his gun.

</b>                         No, my baby. Please no! Just get.

               She pulls up the window in back of the cabin. Inman throws 
               things out into the freezing morning. He has his pants on, 
               but is otherwise naked. He swings over the window and down 
               onto the frosty ground.

<b>               EXT. SARA'S CABIN. EARLY

               Inman picks up his stuff and, at a crouch, runs for cover to 
               the wood which borders the property. He can hear horses and 
               a commotion at the front of Sara's cabin, but doesn't look 
               round until he's sheltered by the trees.

               FEDERAL SOLDIERS, a raiding party, have dismounted and are 
               already wrangling with Sara. Inman watches, pulling on his 
               shirt, shivering, then his boots.

               Sara is standing in front of the hogpen, as if to protect 
               the animal, but one of the soldiers, PISTOL, barges her to 
               one side, toppling her, and opens the gate, starts herding 
               the hog out into the yard. A second soldier, NYM, emerges 
               from the cabin, carrying Ethan. Sara starts up, struggles 
               with him, is again knocked down.

               Then Sara starts to scream.

               Inman is dressed. Boots on. He looks back at the yard. The 
               men sitting, smoking, prepared to wait, their breath coming 
               out in gusts in the freezing air. Flakes of snow fall.

                         shaking! Have some pity.

               A third Federal, BARDOLPH, chases after the chickens, gathers 
               them up.

               Nym gets close to her, putting his rifle to her chest.

                         we'll do whatever you want.

               Nym unties her. Pistol has a rope around the hog and now 
               leads it towards the horses.

               Pistol heads towards the cabin. As he approaches the door, 
               Bardolph rearranges the blankets to, cover the baby. Pistol 
               opens the door. Nym is on top of Sara. Pistol laughs, enters, 
               and is clubbed down by Inman, who steps out onto the porch, 
               while SARA SHRUGS OFF THE BODY OF NYM, HIS THROAT CUT.

               Bardolph looks up to see Inman walking towards him. Bardolph 
               has left his weapon by the fence.

               Behind Inman, Sara stands with a rifle.

<b>               EXT. SARA'S CABIN. LATE DAY
</b>
<b>               THERE'S A HUGE FIRE GOING, WITH A CAULDRON HUNG OVER IT. THE 
</b><b>               HOG HANGS UPSIDE DOWN FROM A TREE, BLOOD DRIPPING INTO A 
</b><b>               BOWL.
</b>
               There's a sense of ritual and order: the chapters of 
               transforming the hog into food.

               Sara is inside the cabin, the door open onto the yard. She 
               holds the baby by the fireplace, swaddled up tight.

               She tries to put him to her breast, but he won't feed. She 
               puts Ethan back in his crib, comes outside.

               Now Inman is butchering the hog, chopping down either side 
               of the spine to make two sides of meat. Now Sara is holding 
               up a sheet of hog fat, as if it were a lace shawl. Now she's 
               rendering the fat into lard. Now Inman's salting the two 
               hams. Now Sara's washing the intestine. She sings all the 
               while -- I dreamed that my bower was full of red swine and 
               my bride bed full of blood -- they don't really converse. 
               Inman continues to work.

               Sara goes back inside to Ethan's crib. Inman glances back, 
               but can hardly bear to, her anxiety so palpable. THE BABY IS 
               DEAD. She looks at it. She takes it up in her arms. Kisses 
               its forehead.

               Makes a strange stifling noise. Inman doesn't look at her.

               She comes out again, shovels some of the food into a plate, 
               serves it up to Inman, gently touching him as she does so. 
               Then serves out food for herself. Inman starts to eat.

               Inman nods. She collects up the knapsacks, including Inman's, 
               and goes back inside the house with them. Inman squats, 
               eating, glancing back towards the cabin. There's the sudden 
               shocking report of a revolver.

               Inman, knowing what it is, goes slowly towards the house and 
               its two dead bodies. His own face is a rictus, the eyes thin 
               slits. If he gave into his grief it would never cease.

               From the house, the silhouette of Inman working outside in 
               the day's dying light, snow falling around him. He's digging 
               a grave.

               Inside the house, TWO BUNDLES, the small body wrapped in a 
               blanket, the other wrapped in the bed's patchwork quilt.

               She walks past. Ada stares into the distance where

</b>
               -- the snow falls down on Inman. He's hardly visible in its 
               gusting waves. Just a thin black question mark, hunched over 
               the elements, moving slowly forwards...

<b>               EXT. OLD MILL, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY
</b>
               THE SNOW HAS STOPPED. It's left a carpet on the ground.

               Stobrod, Pangle and Georgia emerge from the Old Mill. THEY 
               MAKE HEAVY FOOTPRINTS as they set off up the hill towards 
               the mountain.

               Inman comes sliding down a crumbling slate hill and onto the 
               path. He cornea to a place where the path suddenly drops 
               away to reveal a view of the geography. And there, finally, 
               in the distance, Inman can see the blue ridge. Somewhere in 
               there is home, is Ada. He goes on.

               Pangle walks too close to Stobrod and steps on the back of 
               his boot which promptly detaches itself from Stobrod's foot.

               Stobrod turns -- and with a raised finger -- pushes Pangle.

               SOME HORSES CLUSTER around the Stobrod party's footprints.

               Bosie swings acrobatically over his horse, to hang over the 
               tracks, then up again into his saddle, looks at Teague. The 
               Home Guard plod slowly forward in the direction of the tracks.

               A CLEARING, fringed by poplars. Stobrod is making a fire.

               Pangle appears with an armful of firewood, his big grin a 
               fixture. Then Georgia appears. He's carrying A SMALL BUCK, 
               frozen and covered with snow.

               Georgia watches as the music starts, Stobrod playing and 
               singing, Pangle joining in at the chorus. Their improvising 
               is wild, profound, Stobrod chording the fiddle, Pangle 
               following him, then, finishing with another verse and ending 
               with the title declaimed by Stobrod.

               Something like compassion has flickered over Teague's face. 
               Mo and Jo nod to the music's secret rhythms. Only Bosie seems 
               detached, contemplating his long fingernail. The music

               Ruby working in the snow, in the field, clipping a sheep's

               Ada and Ruby arrive at the scene of murder.

               Pangle is keeled over at the old Poplar, snow covering him. 
               Only his girth and a glimpse of coat identify him.

               Ada brushes some of the snow from his face, revealing the 
               death wound, then lays a hand in blessing on his head.

               Ada fishes out Pangle's banjo from the snow. It's broken and 
               the strings hang slack.

               LATER -- and RUBY FINISHES OFF THE GRAVE, hammering in a 
               stone to mark the place. Ada walks away towards the creek, 
               to wash her hands. She bends and rinses her face.

               As she looks up SHE SEES STOBROD ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE 
               CREEK; half-in, half out of the water, slumped against a

               with which she hurtles to her father, oblivious to the 
               freezing water. She puts a head to his chest, seeks out a

               A mean fire burns by the creek. RUBY TURNS A KNIFE IN THE 
               FLAMES. Stobrod's back is exposed. Just by the shoulder blade 
               is an ugly grey and purple bulge the size of a crabapple. 
               Ruby turns to Ada, who is helping.

               CLUSTER OF BLACK CONICAL HUTS, made up of chestnut logs, 
               abandoned and slightly sinister looking. They approach one 
               of the huts, its door long lost. The snow has drifted in. A 
               second hut has a door which they pry open. It's dark and 
               cold, but apparently still weatherproof. They get Stobrod 
               off the horse and carry him inside, then come out again to 
               unload the horse of its remaining load.

               Ruby picks up the blankets and provisions and goes back inside

               Inman approaches the Killing Ground. He studies the ground, 
               finds Pangle's grave. Blood has left its black writing in 
               the snow and he finds first where Stobrod has been, where 
               the bullet had been removed, then the journey away, still 
               tiny, telltale spatters of blood, and the hoof prints and 
               boot prints of two walkers and one loaded horse. He puts his 
               hand into the ashes of Ruby's fire, can't feel any warmth. 
               It's getting dark. He takes a drink from the stream, shudders 
               at the cold.

               The fire burns, a pall of smoke. Stobrod lies on the ground, 
               swathed in blankets. Coughs. Ruby sits next to him, wipes 
               the hair from his forehead. Ada opens her eyes, looks, closes 
               them, listens to the fire, a strange squeaking as it burns.

               First light. The sun creeps up, a red streak of dawn. Inman 
               walking, his head bent to the tracks. He walks quickly, even 
               as the terrain gets more steep. As he bends to the snow -- 
               where a spot of blood has fallen into a hoof print -- A FLAKE 
               OF SNOW LANDS ON HIS HAND. Then a second. He looks up. The 
               snow falls.

               He starts to move more quickly, racing the snow as it seeks 
               to erase the tracks. The snow thickens.

               In the Chestnut Grovel A DOZEN WILD TURKEYS pick their way 
               across the snow. A shotgun lines up its sight at one of them.

               The trigger is squeezed. An explosion of feathers.

<b>               EXT. THREE WAY CROSSING, COLD MOUNTAIN. MORNING

               Inman hears the shot. Then a second, the sound ricocheting 
               around him. He can't quite identify its source but he runs 
               again, heading for the Chestnut trees he can see above him.

<b>               EXT. TREE TUNNEL NEAR CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING

               Ada collects the two turkeys, the first creatures she's ever 
               shot. Doesn't quite know how to hold them. She straightens 
               up and sees, at the other end of the tree tunnel, backlit by 
               the morning sun, THE SILHOUETTE OF A MAN. She drops the 
               turkeys tires to reload the shotgun.

               Inman comes down the tunnel, approaching the hunter he sees 
               through the snow at the other end of it.

               Inman is bewildered by this woman's voice in a man's outfit, 
               keeps walking, peering through the snow. Ada fires a warning 
               shot. Inman, still some distance, suddenly understands.

               stand awkwardly, some distance apart, the emotion stones in 
               their throats. Eventually --

                         the better.

               Inman opens his coat. Stobrod looks at the Lemats. They're 
               at the edge of the trees.

                         I say three, look round, nice and 
                         slow.

</b>                         One, two, three.

               Stobrod looks round. Inman doesn't. Teague has some new bodies 
               in his entourage but they're all dead. A SPARE HORSE HAS

</b>               Teague waves.

<b>                                     TEAGUE
</b>                         God damn! You're a hard fucker to 
                         put down.
                              (they approach)
                         Good directions to that cave from 
                         the fat boy -- saw the squirrels, 
                         sat on the tree made some friends, 
                         brought some back with me.

               His riders begin, quite casually, to fan out.

<b>               IN ONE MOVEMENT, INMAN SLAPS THE FLANK OF THE HORSE. WHICH 
</b><b>               CAREERS DOWN THE TRACK, THEN TURNS AND FIRES, TWICE, BEFORE 
</b><b>               PITCHING HIMSELF INTO A ROLL TOWARDS THE TREES. HIS FIRST 
</b><b>               SHOT KNOCKS JO FROM HIS HORSE, THE SECOND MO, WHO FALLS INTO 
</b>               THE SNOW, BLEEDING FROM THE GROIN AND SCREAMING. The riderless 
               horse gets tangled up with the others.

               Inman is in the trees, shots around him. He doesn't move 
               away from, but towards the riders inside the line of trees. 
               Grayling charges him, riding into the trees. INMAN SHOOTS 
<b>               HIM, THEN RUSHES FROM THE TREES, FIRING, MISSING BOSIE, WHO 
</b><b>               RIDES AWAY, EVIDENTLY NOT RELISHING THE FIGHT, AND THROWS 
</b>               HIMSELF AT TEAGUE, WHOSE HORSE IS BUCKING WILDLY. Teague's 
               carbine fires an involuntary shot into the air. Inman yanks 
               the gun from his hand with his own left hand and lets go the 
               shotgun barrel of the Lemats with the other, the big pistol 
               almost leaping from his hand with the recoil. TEAGUE'S CHEST 
               OPENS OUT AS HE'S THROWN OFF THE HORSE. Mo is still screaming.

               Inman walks over and shoots him in the head, then walks to 
               Teague, who is saying something, the blood blotting the snow 
               under him.

               Inman studies him, picks up the Spencer carbine, turns to 
               look where Bosie has gone, steps up onto Teague's horse, 
               reins the horse in, and trots it over to the prostrate Teague, 
               LEANS OVER AND SHOOTS HIM DEAD. He turns the horse in the 
               direction Bosie had headed. He can't see horse or rider, but 
               in the stand of Hickory Trees ahead, THE GUSTS OF STEAMING 
               BREATH betray them both. He rides slowly towards the stand 
               of trees.

<b>               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY
</b>
               Ada and Ruby walking. They hear the shots. Ada turns and 
               starts to run through the snow, her hat flying from her head.

<b>               EXT. STAND OF HICKORY TREES, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY
</b>
               Inman's horse is parallel to Bosie, who is deep inside the 
               trees but also riding, slowly. It's like a dance.

<b>                                     INMAN
</b>                         Come out of there.

<b>                                     INMAN
</b>                         I just have to shoot the horse from

                              (wearily, as he brings 
                              his horse inside the

                         walking down that mountain looking

</b>                         The confidence of youth.

               And in that second HE PRODUCES HIS GUN AND FIRES. INMAN HAS 
<b>               ALREADY FIRED THE LEMATS AND THE BOY, SHOT IN THE HEAD, FALLS.

               Ada and Ruby running. THEY REACH STOBROD, HIS HORSE STOPPED, 
               DRINKING FROM THE CREEK. Stobrod, barely conscious, hanging 
               halfway down its flank, held on by the ropes.

               Ada hurries on, taking the shotgun from Ruby, who tends to 
               her father.

<b>               EXT. A GROVE OF TREES, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY
</b>
               Ada runs past the horse dragging the cave corpses. She hardly 
               stops to look at the bodies, just rushes on.

<b>               THE GROUND SIMPLIFIES AND SHE'S AT THE BOTTOM OF A GROVE. A 
</b><b>               STEEP INCLINE, THE SUN LOW AND IN FRONT OF HER. SHE SEES A

</b><b>               ANGRY CROWS FLYING TOWARDS HER. AT THE TOP OF THE HILL IS A

<b>               FINALLY, THE IMAGE FROM THE SWANGER WELL EXACTLY AS SHE FIRST 
</b><b>               SAW IT.
</b>
<b>               THE FIGURE RAISES A HAND, BRIEFLY, THEN PITCHES FORWARD INTO 
</b><b>               THE SNOW.
</b>
               She runs, her heart broken, towards the body of Inman. He's 
               dead, the red flag of his life ebbed, away in the snow. Ada 
               falls to her knees and pulls him over, the snow crusted on 
               his face, which she wipes away with great tenderness, then 
               sits, his head in her lap, as Ruby slowly comes up the hill 
               towards them.

               A VIOLIN PLAYS, quite raucous.

<b>               INT. KITCHEN, BLACK COVE FARM, EASTER. DAY
</b>
               A GIRL, about five or six, with Ada's curls, sits at the 
               table cradling a tiny lamb, which won't feed from the nippled 
               bottle she offers it. She tries again. Ada comes in suddenly, 
               takes a knife from the kitchen, and hurries out.

<b>                                     ADA
</b>                         You bring that lamb outside.

               The girl gets up, carries the lamb out into the field.

<b>               EXT. FIELD, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY
</b>
               THE SOUND OF THE FIDDLE CONTINUING, JOINED BY A BANJO, It's 
               a glorious spring morning, Black Cove Farm at its most 
               luxuriant, the path edged with brilliant flowers. There are 
               more animals in evidence. The girl emerges from the house 
               and sees Ada in the field, surrounded by sheep. She hurries 
               over.

               ADA IS EXPERTLY SKINNING A STILLBORN LAMB. The little girl 
               is horrified.

<b>                                     GRACE
</b>                         What are you doing!

</b>                         He came out dead, love.

               She has the skin off the lamb, which lies like a little pink 
               cat on the ground. She approaches Grace, takes the live lamb 
               from her arms, the girl resistant, frightened.

<b>                                     GRACE
</b>                         Don't kill him!

<b>                                     ADA
</b>                         I'm not going to kill him. But we 
                         have to try something or else he's 
                         going to die.

               She takes the skin and wraps it round Grace's lamb. Then 
               puts the covered lamb into the pen with the dead lamb's 
               mother.

               It goes to the sheep and, after a few false starts, starts 
               to feed, accepted as a surrogate.

<b>                                     ADA
</b>                         Isn't that a small mercy.

               And A VOICE joins in with the fiddle and banjo.

<b>               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DAY
</b>
               STOBROD is playing, on his repaired fiddle. His hair is now 
               completely grey. GEORGIA is playing the banjo and singing, 
               although. A SMALL CHILD with Georgia's reddish coloring keeps 
               invading his picking hand trying to join in. RUBY HAS ANOTHER 
               GEORGIA CHILD IN HER ARMS, but is also trying to serve food.

               She passes Georgia and touches the top of his head. SALLY 
               SWANGER is pouring water from a jug, Ada emerges from the 
               kitchen, with a big pie, racing to the table.

<b>                                     ADA

                         Hot hot hot hot hot!!!

               From behind her, Grace appears, carrying a jug of milk, puts 
               it on the groaning board of the table. Grace has a full plate 
               in front of her, picks up a fork to spear some meat.

<b>                                     ADA

                         Mr. Thewes...

               The music stops. And there's quiet except for the sound of 
               animals: lowing, barking, braying, bleating.

<b>                                     ADA
