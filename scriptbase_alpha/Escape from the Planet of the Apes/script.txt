     "ESCAPE FROM THE PLANET OF THE APES"

     FROM BLACK SCREEN
     SHOCK-CUT TO EXTREME CLOSEUP:

1     THE EXPLOSION OF ROCKETS

     as we watch a it speeds away from CAMERA.

                                                  CUT TO:

A-l   EXT. SPACESHIP (STOCK)

     It soars into space.

2     INT. ORBITING SPACESHIP

     through whose windows the same light lividly
     illuminates three space-suited and helmeted ASTRONAUTS
     -- afraid and curiously hesitant at the controls. We
     establish a Dual Date Meter showing the year in terms
     both of "EARTH TIME" and "SELF-TIME."  Both panels
     read: 3955.

                         ASTRONAUT 1 (MALE)
               We made it.

                         ASTRONAUT 2 (MALE)
               So far.  But one thing i8 for certain.
               Whoever wins the war, there'll be no
               place on Earth for us.

                         ASTRONAUT 3 (FEMALE)
               Where are we going?

                         ASTRONAUT 2 (MALE)
                    (briskly)
               Probably to our death.  But just
               possibly --

3     P.O.V. SHOT - EARTH'S RIM WHITENS TO INCANDESCENCE

     and a soundless explosion sends a column of fire an
     mushrooming up towards us.

4     SPACESHIP

     Appalled silence.  Through the ship's windows the
     ASTRONAUTS are watching (and we with them) the nuclear
     disintegration of Earth.  The incandescence almost
     burns through their space helmets.  In awed voices:

                         ASTRONAUT 2
               The fools...they've finally destroyed
               themselves.

                         ASTRONAUT 1
               My God, the earth is no more.

                         ASTRONAUT 3
               And we've escaped.

     The spaceship begins to shudder.

                         ASTRONAUT 2
               We have, if we survive the shock
               wave.

     The shock wave of the huge, megatonic explosion hits
     the spaceship from below.

     Chaos and pandemonium inside.  We multiply normal air
     turbulence a thousandfold and are bashed, buffeted,
     whirled, twirled, lifted a hundred miles and dropped
     fifty, before slowly flattening out to some semblance
     of equilibrium on (presumably) a new orbit.  The Date
     Meter digits under "EARTH TIME" have begun to click and
     race erratically. ASTRONAUT 2 watches intently.

                         ASTRONAUT 2
               The shock must have ... unbalanced
               the mechanism.  I don't understand.

     Now he turns to look at another dial.

5     ILLUMINATED PANEL LABELED "AUTOMATIC RE-ENTRY SEQUENCE"

     Across it curves the descending graphline which traces
     optimum re-entry path.  Now the lights begin to trace
     the spacecraft's actual re-entry path, which sometimes
     slightly deviates to left or right of the graphline but
     always approximately follows its course.

                         ASTRONAUT 2
               We've been forced out of orbit.

                         ASTRONAUT 1
                    (looking at panel)
               We're descending.

                         ASTRONAUT 3
               But where?

     The spacecraft is seared with flames and smoke as it
     plummets through space.  The windows fog and blacken.
     ASTRONAUT feverishly works at controls to no response.

A-5   LONG SHOT - SPACECRAFT (STOCK)

     The fiery missile descends on our screen.

B-5   FLAMES AND SMOKE

     leap at the windows.  Descent is rapid, and suddenly
     through the blackened windows the entry is completed
     for light can be seen flickering through the charred
     cracks.

C-5   SUBJECTIVE P.O.V.

     We descend rapidly to be swallowed in a cloud bank.

D-5   INT. SPACECRAFT

     SHOOTING across the frozen ASTRONAUTS, we see the Date
     Meter spin to a halt.

                         EARTH TIME
                              1973

                         SHIP TIME
                              3955

E-5   SUBJECTIVE P.O.V. (STOCK)

     We are crashing rapidly into the ocean.

F-5   SPLASHDOWN (STOCK)

     The spacecraft split the water into churning waves.
     Then all is still.

6     EARTH - AERIAL SHOT - THE PACIFIC OCEAN - DUSK

     We are watching it from the P.O.V. of a U.S. Marine
     helicopter PILOT flying on normal coastal
     reconnaissance duty; and the coast itself as plane
     banks to include it) is California. All is peaceful,
     empty and deserted.  Until...PILOT mildly reacts to an
     object beached on the tideline far below.  His prop-
     blades louden as he goes into a steep, investigatory
     dive.

7     FROM PILOT'S P.O.V.

     We ZOOM towards the floating and still-unopened 
     spaceship.

8     INT. PILOT'S CABIN

     As he flattens off and reascends:

                         PILOT
                    (radio-reporting)
               Tower, this is Red Baron Five.  I
               have an object beached on the tide-
               line -- uh -- seemingly one of our
               spacecraft.  Coordinates are southeast
               corner of sector Alpha Charlie.  Relay
               this to appropriate recovery forces.
               I have enough fuel to orbit for forty-
               five minutes.  Please alert Red Baron
               Ops and I'll squawk Channel Two for
               radar fix.

                                                  CUT TO:

9     INT. OPS ROOM

                         DUTY OFFICER
                    (on phone)
               Rescue, we have Red Baron Five
               report of possible spacecraft
               washed ashore in southeast sector
               Alpha Charlie.  Immediately launch
               two choppers to effect pickup and
               recovery.  Base Radar will vector
               them to the location.

     He picks up second phone and dials.

                         DUTY OFFICER
               The Colonel, please.

10    EXT. COLONEL'S GARDEN

     The COLONEL, among friends, is barbecuing a steak on
     the lawn of his private quarters as the garden phone
     rings beside him.  The roar of the o.s. helicopters
     passing overhead and the nature of the phone message
     itself distract him from the steak which, during the
     brief conversation's course, is burnt to a cinder.  As
     the helicopters recede:

                         COLONEL
               I didn't even know we had anything
               up.  Okay, I'll call Washington.
                    (seeing burnt steak)
               Damn!

11    HELICOPTERS IN FLIGHT

12    OFFICE IN WASHINGTON

     3-star GENERAL BRODY stands against wall map of
     splashdown area and barks into phone.

                         BRODY
               No serial number? ... Well, it
               may have been burnt out on re-entry.
               ... No, neither did I.  I'll check
               with Deputy Director, NASA, and
               call you back.

     He cuts the call to initiate a new one.

13    EXT. HELICOPTER

     disgorging FROGMEN at spacecraft.  First helicopter
     departs.

14    OFFICE AT CAPE KENNEDY

     INTERCUTTING DEPUTY DIRECTOR with BRODY in Washington.

                         DEPUTY DIRECTOR (CIVILIAN)
                    (patiently)
               General Brody, I'm telling you...
               We have no spacecraft up.

                         BRODY
                    (irritably)
               You're telling me that what never
               went up can't come down.  And I'm
               telling you it just has.  And now
               I'm going to tell the President.

                                                  CUT TO:

15    EXT. BEACH AREA

     Military vehicles, combat Marines, trucks, jeeps, etc.
     swarm.

16    WHITE HOUSE OFFICE

     The PRESIDENT is an articulate, unruffled professional
     politician with a flair for irony.  Into phone:

                         PRESIDENT
               Let us hope and pray that you are
               right, General.  But I think we
               should be alert to a remoter
               possibility:  that the Russians
               retrieved one of our missing space-
               ships and remanned it with astronauts
               who have now accidentally splashed
               down in our own territorial waters.
               If they're alive, you may tell
               Colonel Winthrop at El Palomar to
               welcome them with caution.  Whether
               they're alive or not, have NASA go
               over that ship with whatever's the
               scientific equivalent of a fine tooth
               comb.  And until we know more, I want
               a full security clampdown on the entire
               operation.
                    (dryly)
               You understand me, General.  This is
               not for the networks.

                                                  CUT TO:

17    EXT. SPACECRAFT

     being towed ashore by cable attached to truck winch.
     FROGMEN, swimming alongside, shout orders to truck on
     beach.

                                                  CUT TO:

18    INSIDE SPACESHIP

     Its windows still fogged and blackened; the OCCUPANTS
     still helmeted.  We hear 0.S. FROGMEN faintly shouting
     orders from outside.

                         ASTRONAUT 2
               We are being pulled.

                         FROGMAN'S VOICE
                    (0.S.)
               How the hell do you hold onto this
               thing.

                         FROGMAN'S VOICE
                    (O.S.)
               Some Frogman you are.

     He laughs.

                         ASTRONAUT 1
               They speak our language.  At least
               they have intelligence.

                         ASTRONAUT 2
                    (urgently)
               Then at least let us conceal our
               intelligence from our captors.
               Our safety may lie in silence.

23    COLONEL AND AIDES

                         COLONEL
               Welcome, gentlemen.

     Then their faces stiffen in aghast astonishment, as we:

26    EXT. MARINE BASE - COLONEL AND AIDE

     who is carrying a large paperbag, as they walk past
     Headquarters Buildings.

                         COLONEL
               Did you call the Zoo?

                         AIDE
               Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The
               sick bay's almost empty except
               for a mauled fox cub, a deer with
               pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla.
               The Apes will be hidden from the
               public.  They'll be quarantined.
               If they want medical attention, it's
               available on the spot.  And the
               experts can start giving them the
               once-over first thing in the morning.
               General Brody's very pleased.

                         COLONEL
               Me, too.  Can't have a lot of monkeys
               making messes in the Guardhouse.  Have
               we fed them?  Like raw steak or
               something?

                         AIDE
               The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees,
               like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.

                         COLONEL
               Good God.

     They have reached:

27    EXT. GUARDHOUSE

     whose door is unlocked by an obviously shaken MARINE
     M.P.

                         COLONEL
               What's the matter?

     MARINE M.P. helplessly ushers them into:

28    INT. GUARDHOUSE

     Its rear section (behind bars) is furnished with
     austere but serviceable beds, chairs, tables and a
     washing sink with plates and cutlery in rack above.  On
     the floor: a capacious rawhide valise, from which ZIRA
     (gloved and shod) has extracted a robe into which she
     is changing. Her discarded space suit lies at her feet.
     MILO and CORNELIUS have already changed.  Their space
     suits are hanging neatly from wall hooks.  At COLONEL'S
     entry, MILO and CORNELIUS rise courteously to their
     feet, while ZIRA struggles hastily into her robe.  From
     the threshold:

                         COLONEL
                    (automatically)
               Excuse me.  I didn't mean to
               disturb....
                    (aghast to Aide)
               What am I saying?

                         AIDE
               They're...pretending to dress.

                         COLONEL
               What d'you mean, pretending?
               They are dressing.  Where'd they
               get those clothes?

                         MARINE M.P.
                    (indicating valise)
               They brought them with them, sir.
                    (gulping)
               In a suitcase.

                         COLONEL
               Suit....?
                    (with an effort;
                    to Aide)
               Greg, give them their oranges.

     AIDE advances cautiously with paper bag.

29    MASTER SHOT

     We HOLD COLONEL and MARINE M.P. talking in f.g., while
     AIDE proffers oranges (which the TRIO gracefully
     accepts) in b.g.

     ZIRA, holding her orange, has gone straight to the sink
     rack, from which she takes three plates, three knives
     and three forks.

                         COLONEL
                    (not noticing;
                    to Marine M.P.)
               Arrange prisoner escort for 16:30
               hours...

     ZIRA distributes plates and cutlery to MILO and
     CORNELIUS. To AIDE's astonishment, the APES draw up
     chairs and sit round the table.

                         COLONEL
                    (not noticing;
                    to Aide)
               We're sending them to the Zoo Infirmary.

     The APES start meticulously quartering their oranges on
     their plates with their knives.

                         COLONEL
                    (still to Aide)
               They'll have company.  There's
               a gorilla in the next cage.

     ZIRA, overhearing this, reacts violently; rises, picks
     up her plate and hurls it to the ground.

                         COLONEL
                    (looking round at
                    last)
               Now why the hell did it do that?

     The full implications of the plates and the knives only
     strike him as we:

                                                  CUT TO:

30    INT. ZOO INFIRMARY - NIGHT

     We START on CLOSE SHOT of the deer with pneumonia,
     cradled under ultraviolet lamps which (as we PULL BACK)
     prove to be the huge, clinically furnished room's only
     light source -- for the sick animals must get their
     rest.  We PAN past a recumbent camel and the mauled fox
     cub, into whose small sleeping body the rubber tube of
     a suspended flask is intravenously dripping plasma; and
     END on a white-coated KEEPER (with flashlamp)
     inspecting our APE TRIO, now installed in one of two
     large, contiguous cages at the dim room's center:  
     straw for them to lie on; a bowl of water for drinking;
     and a generous supply of oranges and bananas, one of
     which he cautiously proffers to ZIRA through the bars,
     while playfully patting her head.  ZIRA reacts the
     banana and slaps his face.  Taken aback but still
     amicably:

                         KEEPER
               Have it your own way, mate.

     Clang!  He locks them in and exits.  When the light
     from his flashlamp has faded to near-darkness, we hear
     an outer door more distantly locked.

                         ZIRA
                    (outraged whisper
                    to Cornelius)
               I'm not his mate.  I'm yours.

                         CORNELIUS
               Zira, please control yourself.
               I think they're trying to be kind.

                         ZIRA
               This cage stinks of gorilla.

     She sits down disconsolately on the straw.  Instantly
     CORNELIUS sits by her and takes her hand.  In 
     undertones:

                         ZIRA
               Cornelius -- where are we?  What's
               happened?

     CORNELIUS helplessly shrugs.  From the shadows, very
     softly:

                         MILO
               I know where we are.  I know what
               has happened.

     ZIRA and CORNELIUS stare at him.

                         MILO
               In some fashion -- and I lack
               the intellect to know precisely how
               -- we have traveled from Earth's
               future into Earth's past.

                         CORNELIUS
               But we saw Earth destroyed.

                         MILO
               And Earth will be destroyed --
               just as we saw it.  Only, since
               fleeing it, we have passed through
               a....backward disturbance in time --
               did you notice the Date Meter
               clicking down after the shock
               wave hit our ship? -- and we
               have returned to Earth almost
               two thousand years before its
               destruction.
                         (solemnly)
               That is another reason for keeping
               silence.  Our human captors would
               not be edified to know that, one
               day, their world will crack like
               an egg and fry to a cinder, because
               of an Ape war of aggression.

     His low tones have become just emphatic enough to
     disturb:

31    GORILLA IN NEXT CAGE

     It shifts, grunts and whimpers uneasily.

32    BACK TO SCENE

     The TRIO reacts.  We CLOSE to:

                         MILO
               Apes, at this instant in time,
               cannot yet talk.  For the moment,
               we should follow their example.

                                                  FADE OUT


     FADE IN

33    EXT. ZOO - MISTY MORNING SHOTS (6:00 A.M.)

     We hear occasional call of a tropical early bird, and
     CLOSE to two human early birds:  LEWIS DIXON, a young
     animal psychiatrist, and his pretty (female) research
     assistant, STEVIE.  As they walk:

                         LEWIS
                    (feeling in
                    pocket)
               The driver brought e report from
               the Air Base.
                    (scanning it)
               The usual imitatory behavior ...
               mimicking salutes ... hand-shaking
               ... sitting on chairs ... eating
               off plates with knives ... but--

     He hesitates.

                         STEVIE
               What, Lewis?

                         LEWIS
               There was a sort of carpetbag in
               the ship.

                         STEVIE
               With food?

                         LEWIS
               No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed
               into them.

                         STEVIE
               I don't believe it.

     But his reaction says it is true.  We have reached the
     Infirmary's main (open) door which is guarded by two
     SOLDIERS.

                         STEVIE
               What are they doing here?

                         LEWIS
               Security.
                    (undertone)
               Join the Marines and see the Zoo ...

     Passing between the SOLDIERS, they enter:


A-33  INT. INFIRMARY CORRIDOR

     They don white smocks (marked with their own names)
     hanging from wall hooks; walk past the sick deer and
     the fox under treatment in small box-cages against the
     wall; and enter:

B-33  MAIN ROOM - DOUBLE CAGE

     In one half of the cage sleeps the depressed GORILLA;
     in the other half, very much awake, sit CORNELIUS and
     ZIRA staring at the Intelligence Test apparatus.
     Outside the cage stands KEEPER.

                         LEWIS
               Good morning, Arthur.

                         ARTHUR
               Hi, Dr. Dixon.....Dr. Branton.

     Our APES survey them stonily.

                         ARTHUR
                    (fingering bruise
                    on cheek)
               The female's a bit uppity, sir.

                         LEWIS
               Okay, I'll be careful.  We'll
               start with the Wisconsin
               Multiphasic.

     STEVIE opens the cage.

                         LEWIS
               Go easy, Stevie.

                         STEVIE
               They look pretty docile.

                         LEWIS
               Yes, but don't take any chances.

     The Wisconsin Multiphasic is a screen which can be
     lowered and raised (like a window shade) between the
     Investigator on one side and the Subject on the other.
     ZIRA winks knowledgeably at CORNELIUS.  MILO gestures
     her into more discreet behavior.  KEEPER sets up
     apparatus during:

                         LEWIS
                    (to Stevie)
               Unless the spacecraft was
               remotely controlled, they must
               have been conditioned to press
               at least some of the right
               buttons.  They can't be morons.
                    (to Keeper)
               The female first, Arthur.  And
               set up Tic-Tac-Toe.

     To everyone's surprise and KEEPER's relief, ZIRA
     promptly squats down on her side of the raised screen.
     The hyper-cautious MILO disapprovingly shakes his head.
     LEWIS raises screen and displays a single red cube for
     three seconds before lowering screen to mask ZIRA's
     view.  When he raises it again, he is simultaneously
     displaying a blue pyramid, a green cone, a yellow
     sphere, a blue cube, a red octahedron and the red cube.
     ZIRA instantly selects the red cube, which she offers
     courteously back to LEWIS. LEWIS gives an astonished
     whistle.  STEVIE, too, reacts in amazement.

                         LEWIS
               She seems to be pretty smart.
               All right -- let's make it
               difficult.

     He lowers the screen, and readies an assortment of five
     colored blocks, then raises the screen only for a
     second, then lowers it.  He now adds additional blocks
     to make it an even dozen, and breaks up the pattern of
     five previously seen by ZIRA.  Now, almost smugly, he
     raises the screen, but any superiority he may have felt
     is quickly erased as ZIRA swiftly selects the original
     five blocks. LEWIS is dumbfounded, STEVIE drops her
     notebook and the KEEPER stares in utter disbelief.

     Now, LEWIS pulls the drawer out from the table, and we
     see that slots for all twelve blocks have been carved
     in the bottom.  No slouch ZIRA.  She deftly and swiftly
     fits all twelve blocks into their proper niches.  
     Whereat she rises to her feet, clasps hands over her
     head like a boxer acknowledging victory.  CORNELIUS
     responds with mirth, but MILO shakes his head.

     LEWIS has risen at this interplay between the apes and
     now questions the KEEPER quietly.

                         LEWIS
               They haven't eaten this morning?

                         ARTHUR
               Not a bite....just as you ordered.

                         LEWIS
               Good.  We'll go for the banana...

     Scattered about the cage are a number of oddly
     constructed wooden boxes, all gaily painted.  STEVIE
     now adds several more, as ARTHUR tugs on a rope pulley
     to lower a banana from the top of the cage.

     This is a test unfamiliar to ZIRA, who responds to its
     challenge.  She speculatively eyes the banana; then
     stoops to prowl among the boxes, which she carefully
     examines without touching them.  Then she 
     straightens... and thinks. The tension is 
     insupportable.  Suddenly ZIRA, moving into action, 
     interlocks all the boxes so that they form
     a somewhat eccentric staircase leading to the banana.
     Having done so, she ascends the "stairs," sits on the
     top, and stares smugly at the banana, now only inches
     from her nose.

                         STEVIE
               Why doesn't she take it?


                         ZIRA
               Because I loathe and detest bananas.

                         CORNELIUS
               Zira!

     As though in a slow nightmare, STEVIE sags and faints.
     Somehow, LEWIS catches her and lowers her to the cage
     floor.  Somehow, KEEPER sluices water from the drinking
     bowl over her upturned race.  As she recovers:

                         LEWIS
                    (sweating)
               Help me get her away.  I'll come
               back.

     Jointly supporting STEVIE, they leave the cage, which
     KEEPER locks.  We STAY with:

34    OUT

35    APE TRIO

                         MILO
               Zira, are you mad?

                         CORNELIUS
               Dr. Milo, please don't call my
               wife mad.

                         MILO
                    (evenly)
               I did not call her mad.  I merely
               asked her if she was.  And I repeat
               the question.
                    (to Zira)
               Are you mad?

                         ZIRA
               I hate deceit.

                         MILO
               There is a time for truth and
               a time, not for lies, but for
               silence.  Until we know who i8
               our friend and who our enemy--

                         ZIRA
               And how in the name of God are we
               to know that, unless we communicate?
               We can speak.  So I spoke.

                         MILO
               We can also listen 

                         CORNELIUS
               To a lot of psychiatric small talk --

                         MILO
               And we can watch ...

                         CORNELIUS
               A display of primitive apparatus --

                         ZIRA
                    (kicking the apparatus)
               Primitive?  Its prehistoric.  It
               couldn't test the intelligence of
               a newt.

     She kicks the apparatus again, and it collapses.  The
     GORILLA in the next cage gives a disturbed grunt.

                         CORNELIUS
               Zira, calm yourself --

                         ZIRA
               I am calm.

     She knocks another piece of apparatus endways. Now even
     MILO's self-control snaps.  He stalks to the side bars
     and (with eyes screwed shut in frustration) briefly but
     fiercely shakes them before spinning round, with back
     pressed against the bars, to glare at his two 
     tormentors. We SHOOT AT AND PAST HIM into the next cage
     where the GORILLA now shambles to its feet and slowly
     advances from b.g., during:

                         MILO
               Stop arguing.  It's too late for
               that.

     His body masking the GORILLA's crouched and stealthy 
     approach from them -- but not from us.

                         MILO
               Use your heads and start thinking.
               Now that they know we can speak,
               how much shall we tell them?  ow--

                         ZIRA
                    (screaming)
               Milo-o-o!

     Through the bars two hairy hands converge on MILO's
     throat and strangle him to death.  The roaring of the
     GORILLA, the throttled cries of MILO and ZIRA's screams
     combine to launch:


36    VARIOUS ZOO SHOTS

     of alarmed birds and beasts as panic briefly infects
     the Zoo.  E.g., a sleeping owl opens huge eyes; cranes
     cry; mallards take off from pool; seals cough; apes
     gibber; tigers snarl; lions roar, and elephants 
     trumpet.  We might (instead of separating each cry)
     overlay sound cumulatively so that each new noise is
     added to its predecessors, as we build visually and
     aurally to a massive and bestial crescendo before:

                                             CUT BACK TO:

37    THE CAGE

     The "panic" is over.  Outside, STEVIE (shaken but
     recovered) confers with LEWIS.  As KEEPERS 1 and 2 lift
     a blanketed stretcher and carry MILO's body out of
     shot:

                         LEWIS
               We shall want a full autopsy ...

                         STEVIE
               With particular emphasis on the
               cranial and oral areas.

                         LEWIS
               Keep him in cold storage till the
               reports in.  Then send him to
               Taxidermy.
                    (wryly)
               He's a museum piece.

     A low moan turns their heads toward the cage's
     interior. ZIRA sits crouched in a corner, her head in
     her hands and rocking from side to side.  CORNELIUS is
     comforting her.

                         LEWIS
                    (to Stevie)
               I'd better do this alone.

     She nods and stays outside the cage, which LEWIS
     enters. He looks compassionately at the two huddled
     APES, the straw, the orange peel, the bananas, the
     abandoned Intelligence Test apparatus.

                         LEWIS
                    (gently)
               We mean you no harm.

     Silence and stillness.

                         LEWIS
               Do you understand?  We mean you
               no harm.

     Slowly and bitterly, ZIRA points an ironic and accusing
     finger at the next cage, where an anesthetized and
     chained GORILLA slumps in the shadows.

                         LEWIS
               But he isn't us.  He's your own
               kind.

                         ZIRA
                    (angrily on her
                    feet in a flash)
               He's a gorilla.

     As CORNELIUS soothes her:

                         LEWIS
               I mean he's of your race.
               He's an Ape.  Look.  You don't
               have to be afraid.  We've put him
               in chains and under sedation.
               Do you understand that?

                         ZIRA
               I should.  I've been doing it
               half my life to Humans.

                         LEWIS
                    (dumbfounded)
               Humans?

                         ZIRA
                    (as though this
                    explained everything)
               I'm a psychiatrist.

     A second shock.  LEWIS covers dazed eyes with his hand
     and, after a struggle, regains his self-control.

                         LEWIS
               So am I.  And I mean you no harm.

                         CORNELIUS
                    (at last)
               We know that.

     LEWIS, over one hurdle, exhales.

                         LEWIS
               Do you have a name?

                         CORNELIUS
               My name is Cornelius.  And this
               is Zira -- my wife.

                         LEWIS
               My name is Lewis -- Lewis Dixon .

     He diffidently extends a hand,  CORNELIUS takes it.
     ZIRA doesn't.

                         LEWIS
               Nobody's going to believe it.

                         CORNELIUS
               Believe what?

                         LEWIS
               That primitive apes can talk.

                         ZIRA
                    (furious)
               Primitive?

                         LEWIS
                    (quick smile)
               I mean that in our 'primitive'
               civilization, apes just don't talk.
               I mean I think it's important that,
               when our 'primitive' security
               precautions are lifted, the first
               time you say something in public you
               should talk to what we 'primitively'
               call the Right People.

     ZIRA gives him a long, searching look ... and smiles.

                         ZIRA
               May I say something personal?

                         LEWIS
                    (smiling back)
               Please

                         ZIRA
               I like you.

     LEWIS look gratefully from her to:

                         CORNELIUS
               I did from the beginning.
