           There will always be people who are ahead of
           the curve, and people who are behind the curve.
           But knowledge moves the curve.

          1 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - NIGHT 1

           Static shots: A deserted locker room. Empty showers.
           Cinder-block tunnels lit with wire-encased lamps like in
           a coal mine. THREE SECURITY GUARDS watch a game on a TV.
           LEGEND: October 15, 2001

                         
           We begin to hear disembodied cheering crowds and the
           faint voice of an announcer -

                         

           BRENNAMAN V/O
           ... nobody on, two and two to Saenz - who
           has just three at bats in the series, and
           none of them hits - as he settles back in

                          -

          2 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM -NIGHT 2


                         
           At the end of a tunnel, the A's empty dugout. The empty
           diamond. Just a couple of the floodlights are on.

           BRENNAMAN V/O
           - Rivera looks in for the sign, he has
           it, the pitch, Saenz swings and -

                         
           The announcer's voice and excited crowd abruptly cut
           off. In silence, we regard the 60,000 empty seats that
           wrap around the playing field ... but then see that, in
           fact, it's 59,999 empty seats. There's a lone figure
           seated in one of them. The sound snaps back on:

           STEVE LYONS V/O
           - a ground out to second, Thom, is not
           what the A's were looking for from Saenz -
           down by two in the ninth -

                         
           The lone man in the stadium has a radio and a bag of
           peanuts. He seems at peace as he looks down on the empty
           diamond - a peace only slightly belied, perhaps, by the
           baseball he absently turns in a hand. He switches the
           radio back on -

           BRENNAMAN V/O
           Eric Byrnes has emerged from the dugout
           to bat for Menechino -

           2.

           2.

                         

                         
           He turns it off again. Calmly eats a peanut. Waits.
           Switches the radio back on -

                         

           BRENNAMAN V/O
           - the A's are down to their last strike
           and this Yankee crowd is on its feet -
           Rivera squints for the sign, he has it,
           delivers and -
           Again, at the crucial moment, he cuts the radio. Waits
           just a few moments. Turns the radio back on -

                         

           BRENNAMAN V/O
           It is bedlam in New York. The Yankees -
           down two games to none - have come back
           to win three, and the Division Series.

                         
           The outcome of the series seems to have no effect on
           Billy. He simply gets up, switches off the radio, and
           climbs the steps to leave. But somehow we still faintly
           hear, as he comes past shuttered concession stands toward
           an exit, the voice of one of the announcers -

                         

           STEVE LYONS V/O
           This is an exceptional feat not only for
           New York, Thom, but for Oakland - though
           not the kind you can be proud of: Only
           once before has a team lost a Division
           Series after winning the first two games -

          3 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - NIGHT 3


                         
           It's coming from a small television a night security
           guard is watching. But when he sees Billy approaching,
           he quickly shuts it off.

                          BILLY
           It's okay, Joe, you can leave it on.
           It's no big deal.

                          SECURITY GUARD
           No, it's okay, I don't need to watch it.

                         
           The guard's eyes consider the baseball Billy absently
           turns in his hands -

                         

                          BILLY
           How's Meg?

                          SECURITY GUARD
           She's good, thanks.

                         
           - and the glass window of the bar behind him -

           3.

           3.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           And the boys?

                         

                          SECURITY GUARD
           They're good. Everybody's good.

                          BILLY
           That's good.
           The security guard waits for the baseball to sail through
           the glass, but it doesn't happen.

                         

                          BILLY
           Night.

                          SECURITY GUARD
           Night, Billy. It was a great season.

          4 EXT. COLISEUM - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 4

           A lone car sits in the parking lot in front of the
           Coliseum. We HEAR-

           TARA V/O
           They had three times your payroll, Billy.

                         

                          BILLY
           Yeah...

           TARA V/O
           You're not watching them celebrate,
           right?
           Car's off. Billy sits in the dark on his phone.

                         

                          BILLY
           No. That would be, uh--

                         

           TARA V/O
           Pointless? Self-destructive? Masochistic?

                          BILLY
           Are you asking me to pick one?

           TARA V/O
           What you should be doing is thinking
           about what an amazing job you did and how
           great you are.

                         

                          BILLY
           I'll be honest, right this minute I'm not
           thinking about either of those things.

           4.

           4.

                         

                         

           TARA V/O
           You take a team with that payroll to the
           playoffs? You take the Yankees to a fifth
           game? I'm not even sure the better team
           won.

                          BILLY
           They were down two-love and then beat us
           three in a row. Trust me, the better team
           won.

                         
          BILLY presses a button on his portable radio and is hit
          with sound of sports talk radio--

                         

           CALLER V/O
           --while embarrassing the entire city and
           making a mockery of their fans. I'm sick
           of this.

           TARA V/O
           Let's go away.

                         

                          BILLY
           That sounds good.

                         

          CUT TO WHAT BILLY'S BEEN LOOKING AT THIS WHOLE TIME -
          Three enormous looming likenesses of the Oakland A's
          premiere players on floodlit banners--Jason Giambi,
          Johnny Damon, Jason Isringhausen.

           TARA V/O
           Someplace they don't have a baseball
           team.

                          BILLY
           How about Oakland?

                         

           TARA V/O
           Okay, here are the rules for tonight. You
           can do anything you want but you can't
           give any quotes to the press, go on the
           internet or hurt my car, we have a deal?

                         

                          BILLY
           Yeah.

           TARA V/O
           They had three times your payroll, Billy.
          From the radio we've been hearing shards of "--an
          unprecedented choke--", "--get rid of Billy Beane--", "--
          Billy Beane knows nothing about baseball--".

           5.

           5.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           Yeah.

                         

           TARA V/O
           How about Hawaii? I'll make a
           reservation someplace. The place with
           the turtles.

                         
           Billy gets out of the car.

                         

                          BILLY
           Great. I'm on my way.

                         
           Billy chucks the radio away. Gets back in the car, puts
           it in gear. HARD CUT TO --

          5 INT. OAKLAND AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY 5


                         
           Blur of shapes and colors as we move through a crush of
           travelers to a Hawaiian Airlines counter where Billy and
           Tara check luggage. Billy's got a cell phone to his ear.

                          BILLY
           Is it Boston? You're talking to Boston?
           What are they offering?

           BORAS (ON PHONE)
           What does it matter to you?

                         

                          BILLY
           What?!

                         

           BORAS V/O
           I mean -- what does it matter since
           whatever it is you can't afford it.

                          BILLY
           You don't know that.

                         

           BORAS V/O
           I don't?

                         

                          TICKET CLERK
           You need to hurry.

                          BILLY
           I don't know that -- since I don't know
           what they're offering.

                          (TO TARA)
           What did she say?

                         

                          TARA
           She said we had to hurry up.

           6.

           6.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           Scott? Scott?

                         
          The call's been disconnected. CUT TO: Another corridor,
          as Billy and Tara head toward security. Billy on the
          phone with Boras, continuing where they left off --

                         

                          BILLY
           What did they offer?

                         

           BORAS V/O
           They offered seven and a quarter.

                         

                          BILLY
           Just to be clear -- they offered seven
           and a quarter.

           BORAS V/O
           Yes.

                         

                          BILLY
           As opposed to you said seven and a
           quarter and they're thinking about it.

                         

           BORAS V/O
           No, they offered seven and a quarter and
           I'm thinking about it.
           (nothing from Billy)
           And you're thinking -- what.

                          BILLY
           I'm thinking I don't want to lose Damon,
           but I don't pay my whole infield seven
           million dollars.

                          TARA
           We're losing Damon?

                         

           BORAS V/O
           For seven and a half, Billy, you can keep
           Johnny Damon and we can be done thinking.
           I have to go, my plane is boarding.

                         

                          BILLY
           Wait, don't hang up. Don't hang up --

                         
          Billy drops the phone in a plastic container, steps
          through the metal detector like it's a stick-up, grabs
          the phone again.

                         

                          TSA OFFICER 1
           Is that phone still on?

                         

                          BILLY
           What's the difference?

           7.

           7.

                         

                         

                          TSA OFFICER 1
           Faradie. Can his phone be on?

                         

                          TSA OFFICER 2
           Sir, you need to turn your phone off.

                          BILLY
           It's already through.
          Billy grabs his phone from the other side.

                         

                          BILLY
           Seven point five?

                         

           BORAS V/O
           Seven point five.

                         

                          BILLY
           I'll talk to Steve.

                         

           BORAS V/O
           Talk to Steve.

                         
          Boras hangs up.

                         

                          TARA
           Try to relax.

                         

                          BILLY
           (hitting speed dial
           on another number)
           A small emergency is starting to develop.

                         

                          TARA
           Try. Try to relax.

                          BILLY
           You look fantastic today.

                         

           ARN V/O
           Hello?

                         

                          BILLY
           Arn. Billy. We gotta talk about Giambi.

                         

                          TARA
           Wait, we're losing Giambi, too?

                         

           ARN V/O
           I can't talk about that now. I can't
           talk about anything now.

                         

                          BILLY

           We can't talk now. I'm at a family
           thing. I'll call you Monday.

                         

                          BILLY
           Who are you talking to -- the Yankees?

                         

           ARN V/O
           I'm talking to everybody. But not today.
           I'm not in today. I'm hanging up.

                         

                          BILLY
           Don't hang up.

                          (OFF PHONE)
           He hung up.

                          TARA
           You found Giambi.

          Only if my luck stays exactly the same.

          It's like the bell rang but you're still

           The ceremony is in progress as Billy arrives, plucks a
           yarmulke from a basket, sets it on his head and finds a
           place in the back row for himself and his carry-on.
           He listens to the boy's monotone-reading of verses. He
           fidgets. Taps his foot. Checks his watch. Turns to the
           person down the row and whispers --

                         

                          BILLY
           How much longer you think?

                         

                          GUEST
           What?

                          BILLY
           Nah, it's okay.

                         

          8 INT. TEMPLE LOBBY - LATER - DAY 8


                         
           As attendees exit the ceremony and enter the adjacent
           banquet hall, Billy has cornered Arn Tellem, picking up
           right where he left off three hours ago in Oakland on the

           He's not staying in Oakland, Billy.

                          BILLY
           What did the Yankees offer him?

                          ARN
           It's New York; you've got to give a
           player a reason not to play there.

           What did they offer?

           17 million.

           No way.

                         

                          ARN
           Yeah.

           I don't pay my whole infield 17 million

           You gotta get Steve to let you spend some
           money.

                         

                          BILLY
           That's pretty good advice, I should do
           that.

           Steve doesn't get it. This isn't a
           charity raffle.

                         

                          BILLY
           Arn. I get it, he gets it, Jason gets it
           and you certainly get it. I'll talk to
           him.

                          ARN
           And you're losing Isringhausen, too.

                         

                          BILLY
           Ya think?

                          ARN
           I've gotta get back.

           Hey mazel tov, Arn.

                         

                          ARN
           Thank you. Good luck.

                         
          Arn walks away. Billy looks to his right to see a 12 year
          old kid standing right next to him.

           Are you Billy Beane?

           Yes.

                         

                          KID
           That was a pretty serious choke.

                          BILLY
           Are you from around here?

          9 INT. OFFICE - SAN BRUNO - LATER - DAY 9


                         
           Billy tries, but is having trouble sitting still as he
           talks with Steve Schott - the A's owner - around 60 - a
           college player way back when. He's a successful home
           builder now. Models of developments lie around.

                          BILLY
           We're losing Damon and Giambi. We can't
           survive losing Damon and Giambi.

                          SCHOTT
           Isringhausen's gone, too, don't you
           think?

                         

                          BILLY
           I can win without a closer. I can't
           without power.

                         

                          SCHOTT
           So negotiate with them.

                         

                          BILLY
           I have. They want more.

                         

                          SCHOTT
           So offer them a little more.

                          BILLY
           I have. They want more than a little
           more.

                          SCHOTT
           Like what. What'll it cost - say - to
           keep Giambi?

                         

                          BILLY

           17.

                         

                          SCHOTT
           17 for how many (years) -

                          BILLY
           One.

                         

                          SCHOTT
           For one year?
           Billy nods. Steve smiles. And Billy knows what it
           means. It means, That makes it easy - there's nothing
           more to discuss on the matter.

                         

                          SCHOTT
           I have confidence you'll find a way to
           make it work without them.

           I can't.

                         

                          SCHOTT
           Sure you can.

           Billy. What are we? The Taj Mahal?
           We're a small-market team. Obviously, we

           Fine. He's gone. But I might - for a
           bit more than last year - be able to keep

           We just won 102 games with a forty
           million dollar payroll.

                          BILLY
           With Giambi and Damon. We wouldn't have
           without them.
          Silence. Then -

                          BILLY
           You can't ask me to be okay with losing.
           That's too much to ask a professional
           athlete.

                          BILLY
           It's too much, Steve!

                         

                          SCHOTT
           You're not a professional athlete!

                          (BEAT)
           You're a professional GM.

           We're a small market team. You're a small
           market GM. And I'm asking you to be okay
           with not spending money I don't have. And
           I'm asking you to take a breath and shake
           off the loss. And then I'm asking you to
           get back in a room with your people and
           figure out how you're going to replace
           these guys with the money I do have.

           Got it?
           SCHOTT can go from milquetoast to ruthless in a blink and
           he just did.

          10 INT. BILLY'S TRUCK - MOVING - LATER - DAY 10


                         
           Billy's on his cell again as he crosses the Bay Bridge.

                         

                          BILLY
           Scott. Billy.

                         

           BORAS V/O
           What was that beep?

                          BILLY
           It's just my phone, it's about to
           die, but this'll be quick - listen -
           I'm losing my favorite prospects,
           but I got you the seven point five.

                         

           BORAS V/O
           That's great. I'll get right back to

                          (YOU) -

                          BILLY
           No. No, you won't. I got it for you and
           we're done. Damon stays in Oakland.

                         

           BORAS V/O
           Billy - I have to talk to Johnny -
           obviously. It's my fiduciary (duty) -

                          BILLY
           Whose number is that - seven point five.
           Mine?

           BORAS V/O
           No, it's mine -

                         

                          BILLY
           It's yours. So make your call, but don't
           play me, Scott. We have a deal. I won't
           be a stalking horse. The word stays in
           the - dictionary.

          11 INT. BILLY'S HOUSE - DANVILLE - LATER - DAY 11


                         
           The door pushes open and Billy comes in after his very
           long day. He sets his carry-on bag down. Takes out his
           dead cell phone and plugs it into a charger. Calls Tara
           on the land line.

                          BILLY
           Sorry, hon. I'm gonna need another day.

           TARA (V.O.)
           Take your time, do your thing. There are
           a lot of cute guys here.

                         

                          BILLY
           You've got my suitcase?

           TARA (V.O.)
           No, the airline sent it to Prague.

                          BILLY

                          (PAUSE)
           Why?

                         

           TARA (V.O.)
           Well, we left out of Oakland, honey...
           and I think the baggage handlers knew it
           was yours.

                          BILLY
           (beat, can this get
           any worse?)
           Okay.

                         
           Billy's cell phone rings --

                         

                          BILLY
           I gotta take this.

                         

           TARA (V.O.)
           Wish you weren't insane. Miss you.
           She hangs up. Billy hangs up and switches to his cell --

                         

                          BILLY
           Yeah.

                         

           BORAS (V.O.)
           Billy. Scott. I just got off the phone
           with Dan.

                         

                          BILLY
           No, you didn't.

           17.

           17.

                         

                         

           BORAS (V.O.)
           Yeah, I was surprised he even called me.
           Because he had said --

                         

                          BILLY
           No, I have Johnny for seven-point-five or
           he's not playing anywhere, because that's
           the deal --

           BORAS (V.O.)
           Boston just upped it to seven-seven-five.

                         
           Billy's hand is already in motion to smash the phone,
           but in a herculean feat of self disciple, he manages to
           restrain himself before impact.

           BORAS (V.O.)
           You there?

                         

                          BILLY
           We had a deal.

                         

           BORAS (V.O.)
           We have a deal. If it's eight million.

                          BILLY
           Why am I the ugliest girl at the dance,
           Scott? Why do I get the feeling I'm
           always gonna be a quarter million short?

                         

           BORAS (V.O.)
           I'm just doing my job for my client.
           That's all I'm doing.

                         

                          BILLY
           No, you played me. And you're playing me
           now. Congratulations, asshole. You win.
           Billy hangs up on him.

          15 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - SCOUTING ROOM - PRESENT DAY 15


                         
           Billy and his scouting department - ten men older than
           him - all former players and tobacco chewers still, each
           with his own can of Copenhagen and wastebasket - sitting
           around a large underground cinder block "war room" whose
           most extravagant appointment is a Mr. Coffee.

                         
           Two large white-boards dominate a wall, covered with
           magnetic strips with players' names on them.

           18.

           18.

                         

                         
          On the left board - every player in the A's organization.
          On the other, even larger board - every player that may
          be of interest to them from the other organizations.

                         
          It's the most complex chess board you will ever see.
          But what can be easily discerned are the obvious holes in
          the A's team - the star players they are about to lose -
          their names set apart from the positions they're
          vacating: Jason Giambi (1B), Johnny Damon (CF), Jason
          Isringhausen (RP).

                         

                          GRADY
           Alright, guys... we had a great year. We
           won 102 games and we only came a buck
           short in New York. Now the bad news...
           we've got three big holes to fill.

                          (THEN)
           Let's start with who we like for Giambi.
           We'll go around the room. Who you like,
           Matty?

                          KEOUGH
           I like Geronimo.
           (approval from the

                          OTHER SCOUTS)
           Guy's an athlete. This guy is big, fast
           and talented.

                         

                          GEORGE
           Six foot four.

                         

                          PITTARO
           Top of my list.

                         

                          POTE
           Clean cut, good face.

                          ARTIE
           Good jaw. He's the real deal.

                         

                          GEORGE
           Five tools, good lookin'.

                         

                          BILLY
           Can he hit?

                          KEOUGH
           He's a tools guy.

                         

                          BILLY
           Can he hit?

                          KEOUGH
           He's got a great swing. Natural swing.

           19.

           19.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           So you're saying he can't hit.

                         

                          KEOUGH
           He can hit.

                         

                          BARRY
           The ball explodes off his bat.

                         

                          ARTIE
           It's exciting. When he hits it sounds
           like he's droppin' a firecracker at his
           feet.

                         

                          PITTARO
           Down in the pisser you can hear that
           sound.

                         

                          BARRY
           Sounds like Mays, Mantle, Aaron...

                         

                          BILLY
           That's not what I asked. I asked can he
           hit.

                         

                          KEOUGH
           He's a good hitter.

                         

                          BILLY
           If he's a good hitter, why doesn't he hit
           good?

                          KEOUGH
           He needs a little work. He'll be able to
           hit. He could be a great hitter.

                          BILLY
           Right... we put him up against big league
           competition and suddenly he'll be able to
           hit.

                         
          Grady moves on --

                          GRADY
           Artie, who do we like?

                         
          Billy backs off, incredulous as the scouts prattle on --

                          ARTIE
           I like Perez. He swings like a man.

                         

                          KEOUGH
           He swings like a man who swings at too
           much.

           20.

           20.

                         

                         

                          ARTIE
           There's some work needs to be done. I
           admit it. He needs to be reworked a
           little. But he's noticeable.

                          GRADY
           He's notable?

                         

                          ARTIE
           No, he's noticeable. You notice him.

                         

                          KEOGH
           He's got an ugly girlfriend.

                         

                          BARRY
           What's that mean?

                         

                          KEOGH
           Ugly girlfriend means no confidence.

                         

                          BARRY
           Alright. That's true.

                         

                          PITTARO
           I agree with Art. I like the way he
           walks into a room. Kid's so confident
           his dick gets there two minutes before he
           does.

                         

                          GEORGE
           Passes the eye candy test. He's got the
           looks, he's ready to play the part. He
           just needs some playing time.

                         

                          KEOUGH
           I'm just saying, his girlfriend's a 6.

                         

                          BARRY
           Billy, if you want to talk about another
           Giambi, this guy could be it.
          Enough. Billy raises a book above the table, drops it
          with a dull THUD... STOPPING TRAFFIC.

                         

                          GRADY
           Is that a suggestion, Billy?

                          BILLY
           Guys, stop. You're talking like this is
           business as usual. It's not.

                         

                          GRADY
           We're trying to solve the problem.

           21.

           21.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           Not like this. You're not even looking
           at the problem.

                         

                          GRADY
           We not only have a very clear
           understanding of the problem we now face,
           but everyone in this room has faced
           similar problems countless times before.

                         

                          BILLY
           Good. What's the problem?

                         

                          GRADY
           The problem is that we've lost 3 key
           players that we now have to replace.

                         

                          BILLY
           Uh-uh. What's the problem?

                         

                          PITTARO
           The problem is the same as it always is;
           we've got to put a team together with
           what we've got.

                         

                          BILLY
           Uh-uh. What's the problem?

                         

                          BARRY
           We've got 38 home runs to replace, 120
           rbi's, 47 doubles...

                         

                          BILLY
           Okay, stop. The problem we're trying to
           solve is that this is an unfair game.
           There are rich teams, poor teams, 50 feet
           of crap and then there's us. And now
           we've been gutted. We're organ donors to
           the rich. The Red Sox took our kidneys
           and the Yankees took our heart. And now
           I'm listening to the same old shit about
           having a good body and being a tools guy
           like you're looking for Fabio. Is there
           another first baseman like Giambi?

                          (BEAT)
           Is there?
          Everyone mumbles "no."

                          BILLY
           Then stop looking for one because what
           we'll surely wind up with is the
           McNuggets version of Giambi.

                          GRADY
          Look, we're gonna find 25 guys, put `em
          through player development, teach `em how
          to play Oakland A baseball. This is no
          time to push the panic button. This is
          the way we've been doing it for 150
          years. Let us do our job.

                         

                          BILLY
          If we try to play like the Yankees in
          here, we're not going to be able to play
          with them out there.

                         

                          GRADY
          That's fortune cookie wisdom.

                          BILLY
          No, it's just regular wisdom.

                          POTE
          Who's Fabio?

                         

                          GRADY
          Okay, Billy. Clearly you have something
          on your mind.

                          BILLY
          Bill James.

                          PITTARO
          We're not playing fantasy baseball,
          Billy.

                          BARRY
          Those aren't new ideas, they disproved
          that years ago.

                          GRADY
          Bill James was a night security guard at
          the Stokely Van Camp Pork and Beans
          Factory.

                         

                          BILLY
          He thinks differently than anyone in
          baseball.

                          GRADY
          He's not in baseball. He's in pork and
          beans.

                          BILLY
           Don't attack the man, attack the
           argument.

                         

                          PITTARO
           (to the room)
           I think he just won the argument.

                          BILLY
           What if we've been wrong this whole time
           about what ingredients manufacture a win?
           What if this whole time we thought it was
           the chicken that made the chicken soup
           taste good when really it was the onions
           that made the chicken soup taste good?
           Onions are a lot cheaper than chicken,
           you see what I'm saying?

                         

                          POTE
           I don't have the first idea what you're
           saying.

                         

                          BILLY
           We gotta start over. We gotta rethink
           this thing. We gotta look where others
           aren't looking.

                         

                          GRADY
           With all due respect, we've been doing
           this for a long time.

                         

                          BILLY
           That doesn't mean you're doing it right.
           Do you watch nature docs? You know what
           happens to the runt of the litter? He
           dies. I'm open to any solution, as long
           as it's not what the other guys are
           doing.

                          (THEN)
           Now, I'm going to Cleveland to poach an
           outfielder named Brandon Garcia --

                         

                          TBD SCOUT
           Hold on -- You're going to Cleveland for
           a double-A guy?

                         

                          GRADY
           Billy, I've seen Garcia. He's got a bad
           body. It's not a pretty sight.

           That is a big boy.

                         

                          GRADY
           He's not just big, but kind of doughy. A
           fleshy kind of body.

                         

                          BILLY
           Oh, you mean like Babe Ruth.

                         

                          SCOUTS (UNISON)
           He's no Babe Ruth.

                         

                          PITTARO
           When he walks, Billy, his thighs stick
           together. There's enough friction there
           to start a bonfire.

                          KEOGH
           If you saw him, I'm telling you, you
           wouldn't want to go to Cleveland.

                          BARRY
           Billy, can I make a suggestion? If you
           could get Ricardo Rincon... he'd be worth
           the trip to Cleveland.

                         

                          GEORGE
           That would solve our left handed reliever
           problem.

                         
          Unanimous approval from the scouts --

                          BILLY
           Really?

                         

                          SCOUTS (UNISON)
           Yeah.

                          BILLY
           I should get Rincon?

                          SCOUTS (UNISON)
           Definitely.

                         

                          BILLY
           Okay. I'll also come back with Joe
           DiMaggio and Ty Cobb. And who would like
           a Fabergé egg? Guys, you aren't hearing
           me -- in what universe can we afford
           Rincon?

                          (THEN)
           I'm asking you guys to look at this game
           differently than you've ever looked at it
           before. I'm going to Cleveland.

           And when I come back, I want you to tell
           me something I don't already know. I
           want to question everything. We've got
           to rethink this game.
           As he exits --

                         

                          BILLY
           And Grady? Nobody cares about a 102 win
           season.

                         
           Billy storms out.

           CRACK! A ball sails well over the heads of the SCOUTS in
           the outfield who are shagging the batting practice flies.
           The KIDS in the parking lot have seen Billy play before
           and so know just how far back to stand in order to shag a
           ball.

                         
           BILLY's at the plate, crushing pitches from a pitching
           machine.

                         
           CRACK!--he sends another one sailing over the heads of
           the cluster of scouts.

                         

           CRACK! CRACK! CRACK!
           BILLY, tanned and glistening with sweat, looks over to
           see THREE GIRLS watching him from behind the backstop.
           They're looking at him like he's Elvis and BILLY tries to
           nonchalant it but can't help a small smile to himself

           he creates.

           Very impressive performance today. In my
           job as the national cross-checker for the
           New York Mets, I see the top 200 players
           in the United States. It's been a while
           since I've seen a five tools guy, the
           complete package. Your throwing ability,
           your fielding skills... Ed told me you had
           power but I had no idea it was of the
           light tower variety. I hope you're as
           interested in professional baseball as we

           Well, sir, I'd need to talk it out with
           my parents, decide if baseball is
           something I want to do full time. I have
           a scholarship to play football at
           Stanford.

                         

                          MARTINEZ
           Well, Billy, we're certainly looking
           forward to meeting your folks and talking
           to them as well. And we believe in
           college, but that's something you can do
           in the winter months. You need to know
           the sky's the limit with your ability.
           You could be a superstar before you've
           even graduated. But to get to that
           level, you need to work with our people.
           Pro-ball is where you need to be to
           develop the skills God gave you.

          I should've been a hitter.

                          SHAPIRO
          Where's Steve in all this?

                          BILLY
          Supportive. Excited about rebuilding the
          team.

                         

                          SHAPIRO
          Bonds is available.

                          BILLY
          Yeah, how do I afford the rest of the
          field?

                         

                          SHAPIRO
          So what are you looking for? I want to
          help out.

                         

                          BILLY
          I guess you've touched the bottom of the
          sports industry when your opponent is

                         OFFERING YOU--

                         

                          SHAPIRO

                         BILLY--

                         

                          BILLY
          I need a lefty reliever and I want
          Ricardo Rincon.

                          SHAPIRO
          Not going to happen.

                         

                          BILLY
          Not even a discussion?

                         

                          SHAPIRO
          Come on Billy, even if you could afford
          him we're not about to let him go.

                          BILLY
          Why's that? You've got the Venezuelan
          kid in North Carolina you're bringing up.

                          SHAPIRO
          We dished him to Detroit. Keep up.

                         

                          BILLY
          Well there goes my other idea.

           29.

                         

                         

                          SHAPIRO
           What else you thinking Billy?

                         

                          BILLY
           You have any outfielders I should be
           looking at?

                         

                          SHAPIRO
           To replace Damon?

                         

                          BILLY
           Yeah.

                         

                          SHAPIRO
           That's a tough one Billy.

                          BILLY
           Yeah. Who do you got?

                          SHAPIRO
           The guys you might be able to afford?
           Hollins, Garcia... Coste.

                         

                          BILLY
           Tell me about Garcia.

                          SHAPIRO
           To replace Damon?!

                         

                          BILLY
           Is he healthy?

                         

                          SHAPIRO
           He had a back thing, some minor surgery,
           but he's okay. Petey?

                          PETEY
           He'll be good by Spring Training.

                         

                          BILLY
           He'll do. I can give you Guthrie for him
           if you kick in some cash.

                         

                          SHAPIRO
           Mark Guthrie?

                         
          As Shapiro and gang review Guthrie's stats, Billy notices
          Peter whispering to the guy next to him.
          Shapiro looks around the room at the guys who don't
          object.

                         

                          SHAPIRO
           How much are you thinking?

           BRUCE approaches Shapiro and whispers and steps away.

                          SHAPIRO
           Sorry about that. So... Garcia is going
           to be a no. What else are you thinking
           about?

                         

                          BILLY
           Let's make it work, I'll go straight up
           with you, Garcia for Guthrie, no kicker.

                         
           Shapiro looks to Bruce, Peter is covering his mouth with
           his hand but we can just barely hear him whisper the word
           'no'. Bruce subtly shakes his head to Mark.

                         

                          SHAPIRO
           Sorry Billy, who else you interested in?

           Peter sits at his cubicle absorbed in his computer until
           he notices Billy hovering over him.

                          BILLY
           Hey.

                         

                          PETER
           Hi.

                          BILLY
           Who are you?

           What do you do?

                         

                          PETER
           I'm special assistant to Mark Shapiro.

                          BILLY
           So what do you do?

           What do you do?

                         

                          PETER
           Mostly player evaluation right now.

                          BILLY
           Why does Mark listen to you?

                         

                          PETER
           Actually he rarely does.

                          BILLY
           He just did.

                          PETER
           I don't think he was really listening to
           me in there per se.

                         

                          BILLY
           Really?

                          PETER
           Yeah, I think he was listening to Bruce.

                          BILLY
           Who are you?

           Peter Brand.

                         

                          BILLY
           I don't give a rat's ass about your name.

                         
          Nothing from Peter.

                          BILLY
           What happened in there?

                         

                          PETER
           I'm not sure what you're asking me.

                          BILLY
           What did you tell Butch?

                         

                          PETER
           Huh? Oh Bruce? I told him I like
           Garcia.

                         

                          BILLY

                          (BEAT)
           Why?

                          PETER

                          (BEAT)
           Probably for the same reasons you do.

                         

                          BILLY
           Meaning what?

           32.

           32.

                         

                         

                          PETER
           He's undervalued. You were smart to go
           after him.

                         

                          BILLY

                          (LONG BEAT)
           What makes him undervalued?

                         
           Peter is stuck. He can't bring himself to say anything.
           After a long beat Billy nods to him in a way that seems
           to say, `I understand, it's okay'.

                          BILLY
           Come on.

                         
           Billy makes a strong gesture indicating Peter to follow.
           Which he does. They exit the offices into

           I hate Yale.

           Why?

           What are you doing in baseball?

                         

                          PETER
           I love baseball.

                         

                          BILLY
           I'm just curious. Why were you so cagey
           in there?

          I work for a different team.

                         

                          BILLY
          I know, but I'm the first person in
          baseball who's ever talked to you this
          long. Right? Why is Garcia undervalued?

                         

                          PETER
          Okay, truthfully, it might not be so easy
          to explain.

                         

                          BILLY
          Really? Why's that Peter?

                          PETER
          We might not see the game the same way.

                          BILLY
          Oh really? What do you mean by that?

                         

                          PETER
          You've spent your life in baseball and I
          don't have a very traditional view of the
          game.

                          BILLY
          Hey Pete, just say it. I'm not about to
          beat you up. Say what you've always
          wanted to say to a GM.

                          PETER
          Baseball thinking is medieval. It's stuck
          in the Dark Ages. I have a more
          scientific view of the game.

                          BILLY
          Keep going, Peter.

                         

                          PETER
          There is an epidemic failure within the
          game to understand what's really
          happening. And it leads people who run
          major league teams to misjudge their
          players and mismanage their teams.
          They're still asking the wrong questions.
          People who run baseball teams still think
          in terms of buying players. Sorry to say
          that.

                          BILLY
          Peter, don't apologize for what you
          believe.

                          PETER
           The goal shouldn't be to buy players,
           what you want to buy is wins. To buy
           wins, you buy runs. You're trying to
           replace Johnny Damon. The Red Sox look at
           Johnny Damon and they see a star worth
           seven point five million a year. When I
           look at Johnny Damon, I see an imperfect
           understanding of where runs come from.

           points lower than Garcia's.

                         
          On the next pitch, DAMON takes off for second--

                         

           PETER V/O
           True, he stole some bases. But attempted
           steals in general have to succeed 70% of
           the time before they even start to
           contribute to run totals. In 2001 he cost
           you runs.
          DAMON's tagged out at second.

                         

          BACK TO THE GARAGE

                         

                          PETER
           He's got a good glove. He's a decent
           leadoff hitter. He steals bases. But he's
           not worth the seven point five million
           Boston is paying him. You're lucky to
           have him off your payroll, it opens all
           kinds of interesting possibilities.

                          BILLY
           You read Bill James, Pete?

                         

                          PETER
           Yes. These ideas and this approach to the
           game aren't all new. In fact, some of
           them have been around for two decades.

           35.

           35.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           If this approach has been around for so
           long, why isn't anybody in baseball doing
           them?

                          PETER
           That's a much more difficult question
           than how to win baseball games. Once you
           begin to pull at that string, your
           understanding of the world might begin to
           unravel.

                         
           The elevator door closes.

          21 INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT 21


                         
           Billy's in coach, staring at the night through the
           window, lost in thought.

          22 INT. HOUSE - SAN DIEGO - DAY - 1980 22


                         
           Billy's mother and father escort Martinez and Mets Head
           Scout Roger Jongewaard into the kitchen.

                          MOTHER
           Billy? They're here.

                         

                          JONGEWAARD
           Billy... Good to see you again.
           Obviously you're a very special player.
           We'd like to compliment you on your high
           school career, and we're looking forward
           to you being a part of the Mets family.
           Jongewaard sits at the kitchen table, speaking more to
           Billy's parents than Billy himself --

                         

                          JONGEWAARD
           There's good -- and there's premium.
           Your son is premium. He has it all --
           power, speed, the arm. The Look -- and
           I'm never wrong about that. Which is why
           this is a premium number.
           He sets a contract on the table. Clipped to its top-
           sheet is a check. On its left-hand corner is the Mets
           insignia; on the right, the amount: $125,000. They all
           see it. A lot of money in 1980. Silence. Then --

                         

                          MOTHER
           Billy's been offered a scholarship to
           Stanford.

           36.

           36.

                         

                         

                          JONGEWAARD
           I know. And that's a great
           accomplishment. I'm sure you're very
           proud of him.

                          MOTHER
           So he can accept that, go there, and then -

                          -
           Jongewaard is already shaking his head no.

                         

                          JONGEWAARD
           I understand how important college is. I
           do. But what I can't do is burn a second
           first-round draft pick on someone who
           can't play for four years -- no matter
           how good he is. Four years is ample time
           for someone to get hurt. It happens all
           the time. So, no. I'm sorry. It has to
           be one or the other. To postpone four
           years is four years he could be in big
           leagues. The sooner he gets there the
           sooner he can reap the benefits.

                         
           Stanford or The Money. Young Billy regards the check,
           and then his parents. He really doesn't know what to do.

                          JONGEWAARD
           We're going to give him a different kind
           of education. This won't be his life's
           career, it'll be his first career. He's
           going to be a young guy in the business
           world when his baseball career is done.
           He'll still have his whole life ahead of
           him.

                          FATHER
           It's your decision, Billy. Whatever you
           decide is fine with us.

          23 INT. BILLY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 23


                         
           BILLY's looking out his window while holding his cordless
           phone. He's dialed the numbers in and just has to hit the
           green button.

                         
           And now he does.

                          INTERCUT WITH

          24 INT. PETER'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME 24


                         
           PETER's ringing cell phone wakes him up and he answers
           it.

           37.

           37.

                         

                         

                          PETER
           Hello?

                         

                          BILLY
           It's Billy Beane.

                          PETER
           What time is it?

                          BILLY
           I don't care. Would you have drafted me
           in the first round?

                         

                          PETER
           What?

                          BILLY
           After I left you ran me through your
           computer, right? Would you have drafted
           me in the first round?

                         

                          PETER
           You were a good baseball player.

                         

                          BILLY
           Would you have drafted me in the first
           round?

                         

                          PETER

                          (PAUSE)
           I'd have drafted you in the ninth round.
           No signing bonus. You'd have passed and
           gone to Stanford.

                         

                          BILLY
           Pack your suitcases.

                         

                          PETER
           Why?

                          BILLY
           I just bought you from the Cleveland
           Indians.

                         
           BILLY hangs up the phone. He sits all alone for a moment.

                         

          25 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - MORNING 25

           MONTAGE: Peter pulls into the parking lot for his first
           day of work, takes in the sight of the colossal, concrete
           relic that is the Oakland Coliseum. He's just in time to
           see a paint roller on a long pole laying a white stripe
           down the middle of Jason Giambi's giant portrait.

                         

                          CUT TO:

           38.

           38.

                         

                         

          26 INT. PETER'S OFFICE - NIGHT 26


                         
           PETER's completely converted the place. The dry erase
           boards are covered with undecipherable equations,
           algorithms and numbers and PETER, who's pretty tired now
           after not a lot of sleep, is in the middle of this.
           This is what BILLY sees when he walks into the doorway,
           where he slows down, stops and looks around blankly.

                          BILLY
           Good evening.

                         

                          PETER
           Good evening.

                         

                          BILLY
           I asked you to do three.

                         

                          PETER
           Yes.

                         

                          BILLY
           To evaluate three available players.

                         

                          PETER
           Yeah.

                          BILLY
           And how many did you do?

                         

                          PETER

           47.

                         

                          BILLY

                          OKAY--

                          PETER
           51, I don't know why I lied just then.

                         

                          BILLY
           Talk me through the wall.
           PETER gets up and gives BILLY a tour of the dry erase
           boards.

                         

                          PETER
           This is the American League West. This
           year we're going to need to win between
           97 and 101 games to make the post season.
           Here's the number of runs we'll need to
           score in order to win those games and
           here's the number of runs we can allow.

           39.

           39.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
          Let's make sure we're on the same page.

                         

                          PETER
          Okay.

                          BILLY
          We're going to re-think baseball.

                          PETER
          Yes.

                         

                          BILLY
          Look for an inefficiencies in statistics.

                          PETER
          Examine the ways that runs are scored and
          prevented.

                          BILLY
          Exploit the fact that unspectacular runs
          are just as valuable as 450-foot bombs.

                         

                          PETER
          Unspectacular runs are more valuable.

                          BILLY
          Why?

                         

                          PETER/BILLY

                          (SIMULTANEOUSLY)
          Because they cost less.

                          BILLY
          We believe there's a river that hasn't
          been fished.

                         

                          PETER
          We know it for sure.

                          BILLY
          And because players have been overlooked
          because they don't rise to the standards
          of traditional baseball thinking, we
          believe that in this river, there are
          fish...fish who--
           (BILLY lost it)
          Help me with--

                         

                          PETER
          Forget the fish. In this room is every
          available player at every level of
          professional baseball, and somewhere in
          that group are 25 players that everyone
          has else has thrown out.

                          PETER (CONT'D)
          An island of misfit toys. In this room is
          a championship team that we can afford.

                         

                          BILLY
          Yes. But let me ask you this. If our
          theory is right--

                         

                          PETER
          Math isn't a theory.

                         

                          BILLY
          If it's right--

                         

                          PETER
          It's right.

                          BILLY
          It sounds right.

                          PETER
          It is right.

                         

                          BILLY
          If math isn't a theory--

                         

                          PETER
          It isn't.

                         

                          BILLY
          I'm gonna punch you in the kidneys if you
          don't let me finish a sentence.

                         

                          PETER
          Sorry.

                          BILLY
          If this is right, why isn't everybody
          doing it? In fact, why isn't anybody
          doing it?

                          PETER
          Somebody once said, "It's not what you
          don't know that worries me it's what you
          know for sure that's got me scared." In
          the mid-19th Century in Budapest there
          was an incredibly high instance of
          mothers dying shortly after childbirth
          from a disease called puerperal fever.

          35%.

                          BILLY
          Make this story less boring as soon as
          you can.

           41.

           41.

                         

                         

                          PETER
           A doctor named Semmelweiss showed that if
           the attending physicians and nurses
           sterilized their hands before delivery,
           the mortality rate dropped to 1%.

                          BILLY
           And he was vilified?

                          PETER
           He was institutionalized. For suggesting
           that washing your hands before putting
           them inside someone else's body was a
           good idea. High functioning people can
           live under the spell of an inexplicable
           mental lapse when they think as a group.
           Why isn't anybody else doing it? Because
           they don't think guys who look like you
           are what win baseball games. They know it
           for sure.

           Alright, let's find our team.

          27 INT. VIDEO ROOM - DAY 27

           Peter schleps his computer stuff. Sets up, plugs in,
           fires up. Turns an unused room into a war room with dry
           erase boards and computers. He installs software in the
           video room computer, works on a computer in his room,
           prints two pages of data and reviews.

          28 INT. BILLY'S OFFICE - NIGHT 28


                         
           Peter enters and hands the two pages to Billy. Billy
           reviews, stands, then slowly paces as he reads. Peter
           stands and watches.

          29 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - NIGHT 29


                         
           From somewhere in the outfield, we have a wide view of
           the darkened stadium and Billy's office, which, unlike
           the others, is illuminated. We can just discern Billy's
           silhouette as he continues to slowly pace and study.

          30 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - DAY 30


                         
           Billy and Peter walk down a long, subterranean corridor.
           Peter carries a laptop and a slim notebook.

                         

                          BILLY
           Nervous?

                          PETER
           No??

                          BILLY
           Huh. Interesting.

                         
           Peter doesn't know what to make of that.

          31 INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE SCOUTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 31


                         
           As they near the scouting room, Billy sees ART HOWE
           waiting for him outside it.

                          BILLY
           Hey, Art.

                         

                          ART
           Can I talk to you a second before you get
           started.

                         

                          BILLY
           I got a lot to do.

                         

                          ART
           I know.
           Whatever it is, Billy knows it can't be as dire as his
           other problems, but also knows that to ignore Art would
           be to insult him.

                         
           He gestures for Peter to go into the scouting room alone.
           He'd rather not, but does. The scouts, assuming perhaps
           he's there to make coffee, ignore him. He finds a place
           to sit in a corner.

                         

                          ART
           Who's the kid?

                         

                          BILLY
           That's Peter.

                          ART
           I can't manage this team under a one-year
           contract.

                         

                          BILLY
           Sure you can.

           43.

           43.

                         

                         

                          ART
           No I can't.

                         

                          BILLY
           I've got to put a team on the field, then
           I'll deal with your contract.

                         

                          ART
           How about you deal with the manager's
           contract and then put a team on the
           field?

                         

                          BILLY
           At the moment, if a ground ball is hit to
           first base, nobody's going to be there to
           stop it from rolling.

                         

                          ART
           I have to tell you it's not easy doing
           what I do under the cloud of a one-year
           contract.

                         

                          BILLY
           I know. I been there.

                         

                          ART
           I know you have. And a 1-year contract
           says the same thing to a manager as it
           does to a player: There's not a lot of
           faith there. Which is strange after a
           102-win season.

                         

                          BILLY
           If you lose the last one of the season
           nobody gives a shit about the others.

                          ART
           It's on me now?

                         

                          BILLY
           It's on me, Art!

                          (BEAT)
           And the kid's the new assistant general
           manager.

                         

                          ART

                          (PAUSE)
           What the fuck are you about to do?
          BILLY doesn't answer the question, just walks into the-

          32 INT. SCOUTING ROOM - DAY 32


                         
           -and ignoring Peter - who has tried to inconspicuously
           plant himself in a corner - pulls up a chair to receive
           his scouts' report - which Grady, as always, will lead.
           Art wanders off.

                          GRADY
           How did it go in Cleveland?

                          BILLY
           It was cold.

                         
           The news bothers no one.

                         

                          GRADY
           Let's get after our relief pitching
           problem.

                         

                          BILLY
           We got Chad Bradford. Right-hander.

                         
           Few, if any of them, have heard of Bradford and begin
           leafing through their printouts and notes.

                         

                          GRADY
           Submariner?

                          BILLY
           That's the one. Technically an
           underhander.

                          GRADY
           What's his velocity?

                         

                          BILLY
           Unimpressive.

                          ARTIE
           About 85.

                         

                          GRADY
           Does he have a good breaking ball?

                         

                          BILLY
           Doesn't have one.

                         

                          GRADY
           Why do you like this guy?

                          BILLY
           Well, he gets people out.

           45.

           45.

                         

                         

                          ARTIE
           The left-hander hitters get a really good
           look at him.

                         

                          GRADY
           He's down there. He's down there real
           low, too.

                         

                          BILLY
           Let's move on.

                         
          The scouts aren't sure what to say, and so say nothing.

                         EVENTUALLY -

                         

                          GRADY
           Well, we, I think, have fared better. We
           have some ideas for what to do about
           Giambi.

                          BILLY
           Knock me down.

                         

                          GRADY
           We trade power for speed. A rabbit for a
           gorilla - We go for an overachiever. A
           big heart in the last year his contract.
           Tend to play hard. We usually get a
           pretty good year out of them. Make up
           for some of the offense we lost.
           (puts more names up)
           Or the other option. Just a thought. We
           go for a high-maintenance guy. A guy
           that's a little difficult but talented.
           A guy like Milton Bradley. Well, not
           like Milton. Milton himself. Which do
           you want to talk about first?

                         

                          BILLY
           None of them.
          Grady looks like a man who can't take much more.

                         

                          BILLY
           You're still looking to replace him;
           you're just saying it another way.

                          BARRY
           We got some trades here.

                          BILLY
           We can't do it. What we can do is
           recreate his value to us in the
           aggregate.

           46.

           46.

                         

                         

                          GRADY
           The (what) -

                         

                          BILLY
           Giambi's on-base percentage was .477.
           Damon's was .324. And Olmeda's - bless
           his heart - was .291. Add that up and
           you get -
          He points to Peter.

                         

                          PETER
           You want me to speak?

                         

                          BILLY
           When I point at you, yes.

                         

                          PETER
           Ten-ninety-two.

                         

                          BILLY
           Divided by three -

                         

                          PETER
           Three-sixty-four.

                          BILLY
           That's what we're looking for. And
           that's what we'll find. Three players
           whose average OBP is -

                          PETER
           Three-sixty-four.

                         

                          ARTIE
           That doesn't come out right.

                          BILLY
           You gotta carry the one.

                         

                          ARTIE
           Still don't look right.

                          BILLY
           It's right.
          The others aren't sure what confuses them more - the
          logic, or the guy who shouldn't be in this room.

                         

                          GRADY
           Billy?

                         

                          BILLY
           Yes.

           47.

           47.

                         

                         

                          GRADY
           Who's that?

                         

                          BILLY
           That's Peter.
          And that's all he's going to tell them about Peter.

                         

                          GRADY
           I don't know how to say this delicately -
           but does - Peter - need to be here?

                         

                          BILLY
           Yes.

                          POLONI
           What's with this on base percentage
           obsession? Is that Bill James bullshit?

                          BILLY
           You can call it Billy Beane bullshit for
           all I care.

                         
          Billy takes a Marks-A-Lot, jots down three names on
          strips, and approaches the board.

                          BILLY
           So here's who we want. One.

                         
          He puts the first strip up. It reads: JEREMY GIAMBI.

                          BILLY
           Jason's little brother Jeremy.

                         

                          BARRY
           He never comes home from the games.

                         

                          POLONI
           Billy, if I may, he's had his problems on
           the field -- not to mention his problems
           off the field -- not to mention he's
           getting a little thick around the middle
           -- there's the stuff with the weed. He's
           at strip joints...

                         

                          GRADY
           This guy could start the year with an
           agent and end up with a parole officer
           for Christ's sake.

                          BILLY
           His on-base percentage is all we're
           looking at now and he gets on base an
           awful lot for someone who only costs
           $285,000 a year.

           48.

           48.

                         

                         

                          GEORGE
           He can't catch a ball in the outfield.
           I've seen him lose a ball in the
           moonlight.
          Billy puts up another name: DAVID JUSTICE.

                         

                          BILLY
           David Justice.

                         

                          GRADY
           Ten years ago he was a big name. He's
           going to really help our season tickets
           at the beginning of the year. But by
           June he's not going to be hitting his
           weight.

                         

                          PITTARO
           He's 36!

                         

                          ARTIE
           His legs are gone. He's a defensive
           liability. I question whether the bat
           speed is still there.

                         

                          BARRY
           Steinbrenner is so pissed at his decline
           he's willing to eat up half his contract
           to get rid of him.

                          BILLY
           That's good.

                         

                          HOPKINS
           He's a fossil. With all due respect,
           bringing these three guys aboard is like
           putting bubble gum on a flat tire.

                         

                          GRADY
           And why do we want to be the ones to bail
           Justice out of his contract?

                         
          Billy points at PETER --

                         

                          PETER
           He gets on base.

                          GRADY
           I got 37 free agents who are better than
           those guys.

                         

                          BILLY
           Scott Hatteberg.

           49.

           49.

                         

                         

                          POTE
           Who?

                         

                          BILLY
           Exactly. Sounds like an Oakland A
           already. Yes, he's got a little damage
           in his elbow.

                         

                          GRADY
           Some damage? He can't throw.

                         

                          BILLY
           We're not interested in him for his arm
           anymore than we wanted Giambi for his.

                          GRADY
           Wait, you're talkin' about Hatteberg at
           first?

                         

                          BILLY
           Yes.

                         

                          HOPKINS
           He's a career .260 hitter and the good
           part of his career is over.

                          BILLY
           I say it's just starting.

                         

                          PITTARO
           Well, Billy, you'll like the sound of
           this... I hear Boston wants to cut him
           and no one wants to pick him up.

                         

                          BILLY
           That's good news for us. He's cheap.

                         

                          GRADY
           Let me understand this. At first base
           you want a guy who's been cut from half
           of the minor league teams in the country
           due to irreparable nerve damage?

                          BILLY
           He can't hit and he can't field, but what
           can he do?

                          (BEAT)
           Look at the piece of paper or I'm going
           to point at Peter.
          The SCOUTS consult their spreadsheets and then answer

                         HALF-HEARTEDLY--

           50.

           50.

                         

                         

                          SCOUTS

                          (HALF-HEARTEDLY)
          He can get--

                         

                          BILLY
          He can get on base.

                         

                          POLONI
          Alright, so he walks a lot.

                         

                          BILLY
          He gets on base a lot, Rocco. Do I care
          if it's a walk or a hit?

                          PETER
          You do not.

                         

                          POLONI
          These three players, by your own
          admission, are defective in one way or
          another.

                         

                          BILLY
          Yeah.

                          GRADY
          You want to replace Jason Giambi with not
          one but three defective players?

                         

                          BILLY
          You got it.

                          GRADY
          Billy, we've all been busting our asses
          the last six and a half weeks to make
          this a better ball--

                         

                          BILLY
           (cutting him off)
          Grady, it's not a discussion.

                          POTE
          I think we're all losing sight of the
          fact that you're the general manager.
          You only have to answer to ownership and
          God.

                          BILLY
          I didn't know God followed baseball.

                         

                          POTE
          I hope he does.

           51.

           51.

                         

                         
           Some of the scouts look over in Peter's direction, no
           doubt wondering if he's had something to do with their
           general manager's ideas.

                         

                          WASHINGTON
           Billy, I just don't see it.

                         

                          BILLY
           That's okay, Wash. We won't be victimized
           by what we see anymore.

                         

                          WASHINGTON
           I understand what you're saying about
           their averages, but there's something
           you're forgetting. None of them plays
           first base.

                         

                          BILLY
           I haven't forgotten that, Wash. One of
           them is going to have to learn.

                         

                          WASHINGTON
           Learn.

                         

                          BILLY
           You're going to have to teach him.

                          WASHINGTON
           Teach.

                          BILLY
           Instruct.

                         

                          WASHINGTON
           Which one?

                         

          33 EXT/INT. TACOMA HOUSE - NIGHT 33

           A Christmas tree. Four stockings hang from the mantle.
           The phone rings. SCOTT HATTEBERG gets up. He looks at it.
           Looks at his wife. Picks it up.

                         

                          SCOTT
           Hello?

                         

                          BILLY (VO)
           Scott?

                          SCOTT
           Yes?

                         

                          BILLY (VO)
           It's Billy Beane. Oakland A's.

                         
           SCOTT was expecting that it would be someone else...

           52.

           52.

                         

                         

                          SCOTT
           Yes?

                         

                          BILLY (VO)
           Can we talk?

                          SCOTT
           Yes.

                          BILLY (VO)
           You want to invite me in?

                         

                          SCOTT
           What?

                          BILLY (VO)
           I'm outside. I can see you in the window.
           SCOTT goes to the window and cups his hands against the
           glass to see outside.

                         

                          ELIZABETH
           Honey?

                         
           Two silhouettes are standing on the edge of the fairway.
           One of them waves.

          34 INT. SCOTT HATTEBERG'S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT 34

           ELIZABETH is putting out some cookies shaped like stars
           and bells for the late-night guests: BILLY and RON

           WASHINGTON.

                          BILLY
           Thank you, ma'am.

                         

                          WASHINGTON
           Thank you, ma'am.

                         
           She leaves her husband with the two men but listens in on
           their conversation from the next room, nibbling on a
           cookie of her own.

                         

                          BILLY
           You've played catcher your whole life?

                         

                          SCOTT
           Since I was 8.
           BILLY produces a baseball from his windbreaker and hands
           it to SCOTT. SCOTT can only manage to grip the baseball
           like a claw. Washington looks to heaven.

                         

                          BILLY
           How's the elbow?

           53.

           53.

                         

                         

                          SCOTT
           Good. Real good. It's great.

                          (FUCK IT)
           I can't throw at all.

                          BILLY
           Yeah, don't worry about it. You've thrown
           your last baseball from behind the plate.
           I want you at first.
          SCOTT is so thrown by this that all he can do is stare at
          BILLY. Then at WASHINGTON, who's shrug tells SCOTT "This
          wasn't my idea."

                          SCOTT
           I've only ever played catcher.

                         

                          BILLY
           You're not a catcher anymore. If you
           were, then mine wouldn't have been the
           only call you got when your contract
           expired at midnight.

                         

                          SCOTT
           I appreciate it but--

                         

                          BILLY
           You're welcome.

                         

                          SCOTT

                          YOU SEE--

                          BILLY
           You don't know how to play first base.

                          SCOTT
           That's right.

                         

                          BILLY
           It's not that hard. Tell him, Wash.

                          WASHINGTON
           It's incredibly hard!

                         

                          BILLY
           Anything worth doing is. Wash is gonna
           teach you.

                         

                          SCOTT
           Wait a minute, what about--

                         

                          BILLY
           Jason's gone, Scott.

           54.

           54.

                         

                         

                          SCOTT
           I'm taking Giambi's spot at first? What
           about the fans?

                         

                          WASHINGTON
           Yeah, maybe I can teach one of them.

                         

                          BILLY
           The fans don't run--

                          (TO WASHINGTON)

                          --GOOD ONE--
           (back to SCOTT)
           --the fans don't run my ball club.

                          SCOTT
           They're gonna hate me.

                         

                          WASHINGTON
           (motioning to BILLY)
           No, they're gonna hate him.

                          BILLY
           The fans love me.

                         

                          WASHINGTON
           Okay.

                         
          HATTEBERG's YOUNG DAUGHTER comes down the staircase in
          her pajamas, having just woken up in the middle of the
          night.

                         

                          BILLY
           Hello.

                         

                          HATTEBERG'S DAUGHTER
           Hi.

                         

                          SCOTT
           That's our youngest daughter.

                          BILLY
           Great.

                          SCOTT
           Do you have kids?

                         
          BILLY doesn't like to share personal lives with the
          players but he covers well--

                         

                          BILLY
           --yeah, I have a daughter.

                         
          BILLY takes a contract out of his windbreaker and sets it
          on the table next to the cookies.

           55.

           55.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           This is a contract for you to play
           baseball with the Oakland A's. A copy's
           on its way to your agent. Discuss it with
           your wife and let us know.
           (They get up and
           Billy calls off)
           Thanks for the cookies, ma'am.
           We see ELIZABETH with tears running down her face...then
           go back to the living room--

                         

           ELIZABETH (O.S.)
           You're welcome.

                          BILLY

           Merry Christmas.

          35 EXT./INT. SAN DIEGO - PRESENT DAY 35


                         
           The door of a suburban house opens, revealing a WOMAN.

                         

                          BILLY
           Hi.

                         

                          SHARON
           Hi, Billy.

                         
           She pulls the door open so he can come in. As he does -

                          BILLY
           She home?

                          SHARON
           She's out, but she'll be home soon.

                         

          36 INT. SAN DIEGO HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 36


                         
           As Billy enters his ex-wife Sharon's house, her husband
           ALAN walks in, talking on the phone.

                          ALAN

                          (ON PHONE)
           Yeah, no, don't worry about it sweetie.
           Here's mom.

                         
           Alan hands Sharon the phone.

                          BILLY
           Hey Alan.

                         

                          ALAN
           Come on in have a seat. Want some coconut
           water? It's really refreshing.

           56.

           56.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           I'm all set, thanks.

                         

                          ALAN
           What are you benching now?

                          BILLY
           I don't keep count.

                          ALAN
           Well, whatever it is, it's working. You
           look good.

                         
          They sit on the couch next to a Christmas tree.

                          ALAN
           I haven't got to see you since the
           playoffs in New York. That was
           heartbreaking, Billy. We were rooting for
           you.

                         

                          BILLY

                          (BEAT)
           Yep.

                         

                          ALAN
           You know what I say?

                         

                          BILLY
           Fuck `em.

                          (BEAT)
           I'm sorry Alan, what do you say?

                         

                          ALAN
           No, I just wanted to say that a lot of
           teams don't get that far, and to make it
           that far is a really big accomplishment.

                         
          Sharon gets off the phone and joins them.

                          BILLY

                          (TO SHARON)
           So how is she?

                         

                          SHARON
           She's great. Be here in a minute. How's
           the team shaping up?

                         

                          BILLY
           New beginnings. Blue horizons.

                         

                          ALAN
           I read that you lost two players. Damon

           Ghee-ambi?

                         

                          SHARON
           Giambi. Wow, that's tough. That's really
           tough.

                         

                          BILLY
           And Isringhausen.

                         

                          ALAN
           Sounds tough.

                         

                          BILLY
           So where is she?

                          ALAN
           I just talked to her on her cell. She's
           just coming up the hill, she's two
           minutes away.

                         

                          BILLY
           You bought her a cell phone?

                         

                          SHARON
           Yeah.

                          BILLY
           At 12?

                          ALAN
           Just for emergencies. I'm sorry, we
           should have consulted you for that

                          DECISION-

                          BILLY
           It's probably a good idea.

                         

                          SHARON
           But actually I called you -
           The front door opens. It's Billy's daughter Casey - a pre-
           teen indie-rock girl - and not a moment too soon. He's
           up quickly to give her a hug and to get out of here.

                         

                          BILLY
           Let's go shopping.

           Billy and Casey peruse guitars.

                         

                          BILLY
           You want one with nylon strings, right?

           58.

                         

                         

                          CASEY
           I like the red ones.

                         

                          BILLY
           How about this?

                          CASEY
           Yeah, that's cool.

                          BILLY
           Let's try it out over here.

                         
          They take a seat. Casey easily fingers through a very
          tough spray of notes.

                          BILLY

                          (GENUINELY IMPRESSED)
           Casey.

                          CASEY
           Yeah.

                         

                          BILLY
           You got good.

                         

                          CASEY
           I've just been playing a lot.

                         

                          BILLY
           That's... that's not the way most 12 year
           olds play.

                         

                          CASEY
           Alan thinks I should have a better
           teacher.

                          BILLY
           Who's Alan?

                         
          CASEY looks at him --

                          BILLY
           Oh, yeah. Mom's Alan. What's wrong with
           the teacher you have now?

                         

                          CASEY
           Alan thinks I should be working more on
           technique so I don't learn bad habits.

                          BILLY
           Well, you seem to be doing just fine to
           me. Do you like playing?

                         

                          CASEY
           I love it.

           59.

           59.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           That's so great. I'm so happy for you.
           The most important thing in life is to
           find something you love and do it well.
           Do you like your teacher?

                          CASEY
           Yeah.

                          BILLY
           Okay, I'll talk to Mom and Alan. Do you
           like that guitar?

                         

                          CASEY
           Yes!

                          BILLY
           That the one?

                          CASEY
           Yeah, I think so.

                         

                          BILLY
           Let's get it. Let's get it now.

                         

                          CASEY
           Really?

                         

                          BILLY

                          LEGEND: 1984
           BILLY's at the plate, a batting helmet snug around his
           head, wearing a METS uniform, as a 97 mph fastball buzzes
           by him and the UMPIRE calls--

                          UMPIRE
           Striiike!

                         
           BILLY steps out of the box, taps the dirt off his cleats
           and steps back in.

                         
           A younger-looking SHARON is sitting in field level seats,
           looking on nervously and trying not to show it.
           BILLY half-swings at the breaking ball, holding his swing
           at the last minute.

           60.

           60.

                         

                         
           The CATCHER and PLATE UMPIRE both point down to first
           base for the call and the FIRST BASE UMPIRE makes a fist
           in the air, indicating that Billy swung.

           And Billy's out.
           SHARON holds her head in her hands and BILLY walks back
           to the dugout, passing a player with "STRAWBERRY" on his
           back.

                         
           And now the quick scenes of failure become staccato--

           ANNOUNCER V/O
           ...If you're a real baseball fan with a
           good memory you might remember that Billy
           Beane was taken in the first round of the
           amateur draft back in 1980, separated
           from All-Star outfielder Daryl Strawberry
           by only 14 picks, so it just goes to
           show...

                         
           BILLY in an A's uniform. He stands and watches a called
           third strike sail past him.

                          UMPIRE
           Strike!

                         
           Billy breaks the bat over his thigh and drops the pieces
           on the plate. He begins to walk off.

           Hey Billy, clean up after yourself.

                         
           Billy hears him but continues to walk off.

           BILLY looks up at SHARON in the seats behind the dugout
           but the two can't quite meet each other's eyes.

          47 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - DAY 47


                         
           In the subterranean video room - an even less elegant
           place than the rest of the stadium - someone has put up a
           scraggly Christmas tree. There, Peter watches a tape of
           a minor leaguer on the Lowell Spinners, a Single-A Boston
           affiliate. Billy comes in.

                         

                          PETER
           How'd it go?

                         

                          BILLY
           How'd what go?

                          PETER
           Hatteberg.

                         

                          BILLY
           He can barely hold a baseball. But he's
           our guy now.
           Billy sits.

                         

                          BILLY
           Who's that?

                         

                          PETER
           That is Kevin Youkilis. This is the guy
           we want more than anyone else in the
           world.

                         
           Billy watches the guy on the screen. He's an overweight
           right-handed batter with a peculiar stance.

                         

                          PETER
           He can't run, throw or field. But he
           walks more than anyone in baseball except
           Barry Bonds. Take out intentional walks
           and it's more than Bonds. He's the Greek
           God of Walks.

                         
           On the TV, the batter takes another pitch just off the
           edge of the strike zone.

           63.

           63.

                         

                         

                          PETER
           I tried to get Shapiro to draft him last
           June. He said he waddled like a duck.
           Boston took him. Boston won't let him go
           yet. They're going to wait and see.

                         
           They watch him lay off a pitch an inch outside the strike
           zone. Peter gives Billy a look that says, You see that?

                         

                          PETER
           You all right, Billy?

                         

           GRADY O/S
           Billy?
           Grady has appeared behind them at the door.

                         

                          GRADY
           Can we talk a minute?

                         

                          BILLY
           Yeah.

                          (TO PETER)
           Yeah.

                         

          48 INT. LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 48


                         
           Grady closes the video room door for privacy. The only
           other person in sight is manager Art Howe, in his office
           in street clothes. He shuts his windowed door so Grady
           and Billy can talk in confidence.

                         

                          GRADY
           Your boy and I had a talk while you were
           in Tacoma. I didn't like much of what I
           heard.

                          BILLY
           No?

                          GRADY
           No. You got a kid in there with a Yale
           economics degree and a scout out here
           with 29 years baseball experience and
           you're listening to the wrong one.

                         

                          BILLY
           I don't listen to anyone, you know that.

                          GRADY
           This isn't a joke.

                         

                          BILLY
           I'm not joking.

           64.

           64.

                         

                         

                          GRADY
           This isn't how you run a ball club, with
           a computer. You know that. You're a
           baseball man. There are intangibles
           that only a scout can see in a player
           that you're not going to pick up with
           just numbers, with someone who doesn't
           play the game, who knows nothing about
           the game but how to feed numbers into a
           computer.

                         

                          BILLY
           That's what we're doing. That's exactly
           what we're doing.

                          GRADY
           If this is what baseball is, if it's not
           Kirk Gibson going up to the plate on two
           bad legs because the manager felt in his
           heart that he had one swing left in that
           body... a computer wouldn't do that.
           They would have had him sitting up in the
           stands.

                         

                          BILLY
           A computer doesn't romanticize the sport.
           Leave that for the fans.

                         

                          GRADY
           Well, romance and the fans, it's called a
           love affair with the game and it's been
           going on for one hundred and fifty years.

                         

                          BILLY
           I don't want to hurt you love affair with
           the game. Just because we've been doing
           it one way for a hundred and fifty years
           doesn't mean we've been doing it right.
           You have any idea how long people thought
           the sun revolved around the earth? To
           your eyes it looks like that's what's
           happening.

                         

                          GRADY
           You're saying everybody's been wrong?
           Everybody?
          Beat.

                          GRADY

          --we're gonna see if you're right?! This
          is about you and your shit? Some scouts
          from 20 years ago called it wrong, okay?
          They thought you were a ballplayer and
          you weren't. As you know, it happens.
          Don't take it out on--

                          BILLY
          No, you're not saying anything to me
          right now.

                          (BEAT)
          Grady, you don't have special powers. You
          don't have the ability to look at a guy
          and "just know" because you're a scout
          with special powers. I've watched you sit
          at kitchen tables for years and tell the
          parents of a 17 year old kid, "Trust me,
          when I know, I know, and when it comes to
          your son, I know" and you don't. We're
          shopping in a new store--full of
          complicated statistical analysis and
          equations and I get that it turns your
          world upside down but on base percentage--
          our best chance to score on our budget
          isn't getting a 6'4" Adonis to the plate,
          it's getting a 5'10" washout who's
          already at first base.

                          (PAUSE)

           You're making it impossible for yourself
           to get another job once Schott fires you
           after this catastrophic season you're
           setting us all up for and you're gonna
           have to explain to your wife and your kid
           why you're working at Dick's Sporting
           Goods.

                         

                          BILLY
           I'm not gonna fire you, Grady.

                         

                          GRADY
           Go fuck yourself, Billy.

                         

                          BILLY
           Well now maybe.

                         
           GRADY takes off.
           BILLY stands there a moment. On his way out, passing
           Art's windowed office, he exchanges a look with the
           manager. Billy takes a short walk to where a few of his
           scouts are standing around an arcade console. To the
           youngest one -

                         

                          BILLY
           Eric. You never even played high school
           ball, right?

                         
           The young scout shakes his head, embarrassed.

                          BILLY
           Grady's gone. You're the new Head Scout.

                         
           Billy turns away and is headed back to the video room.
           Pokes his head in.

                         

                          BILLY
           Don't try to explain things to scouts.
           They're not programmed to get it. It's
           just us.

                         
           He leaves. Peter watches the door close, then glances
           back to the tape as Youkilis takes ball four and waddles
           down to first base.

           Various stations have been set up at which infielders go
           through their warm-ups - wind sprints, arm loosening.
           Infielders field grounders hit by Art Howe from a fungo.

           Art hits another grounder which Hatteberg botches again.
           Art looks at Billy a good long beat, then hits to another
           infielder.

                         
           Peter walks up to Billy, just as -

           like a postman trying to escape a mad dog. The ball
           lands behind him.

                          BILLY
           Well, we didn't pay him for his defense.

                         
           Art and Washington hit grounders to Carlos Pena and Scott
           Hatteberg. Hatteberg miraculously gets his mitt on it.

                         

                          BILLY
           That's the way, Hatte. Pickin' Machine.

                         
           Behind a portable backstop, a guy with a radar gun gets
           ready to clock a trio of relievers. Mike Magnante has
           his pant legs pulled up to adjust knee-braces. Magnante
           gets up and begins throwing, increasing his velocity each
           time.

                         

                          BILLY
           None of those broke 85.

           68.

           68.

                         

                         
           They watch the second pitcher - the gentle-faced kid from
           the locker room - Chad Bradford - step up.

                         

                          BILLY
           Chad I have high hopes for.
           Bradford overthrows his first submarine hand-scraping-
           the-ground pitch, and the ball sails wide of the catcher.
           Somebody ducks. Art Howe glances with a long-suffering
           look to Billy.

                          BILLY
           It just got away from him.

                         
           They watch David Justice do wind sprints.

                          BILLY
           He's still got it.

                         
           Then Justice stops, winded.

          50 INT. LOCKER ROOM - ARIZONA - LATER 50


                         
           As the players shower and change into street clothes,
           Art, Billy and Washington discuss Hatteberg, who knows
           they're discussing him.

                          BILLY
           It's the first day of week one. There's
           nothing to judge yet.

                         

                          ART
           I can judge it and so can you. First
           base is the moon to him.

                         

                          BILLY
           It wasn't to Giambi? He's the worst
           first baseman in baseball. What do you
           think of him, Wash?

                         

                          WASHINGTON
           The nicest way I can put it is, he lacks
           confidence.

                          BILLY
           Work with him Wash.

                          WASHINGTON
           I'll do that, Billy, but we've got Pena
           who can play first. And he's looking
           pretty good out there.

                         

                          BILLY
           I want to make it work with Hatte, Wash.

           69.

           69.

                         

                         
           As Washington crosses the locker room to lie to Scott
           about how much progress he's making, he passes Magnante
           taking off his knee braces, and Chad Bradford sitting at
           his locker with a Bible in his lap.

                          ART
           Not to mention we already have a first
           baseman.

                          BILLY
           A rookie first baseman. It's not the
           same.

                         

                          ART
           Number 11 on the Top 100 Prospects list.

                          BILLY
           Lists aren't baseball.

                          ART
           Catchers at first base aren't baseball.
           Who's idea was this? Peter's?

                         

                          BILLY
           Hatteberg will be fine, Art.

                          ART
           He will be fine, you're right. Pinch
           hitting while Pena plays first base.

           A towering portrait of David Justice has been painted

           The hardest diehard fans file under it and through the
           turnstiles. You know what they look like, dripping A's

           When I first started these things? It
           was like a half hour process. Now I can
           knock these suckers out in 30 seconds, no

           Jeremy Giambi's boombox is on again as he and his 24
           teammates suit up.
           36-year-old David Justice wanders past to a soda machine.
           Presses a button, but nothing comes out. Tries again.

           Always been like that here.

           BRADFORD's locker...

                         

                          CHAD
           Excuse me, Mr. Beane.

           Hey Chad.

                          CHAD
           I hope I'm not disturbing you.

           You're not, what's up?

           I wanted to say thanks for the
           opportunity.

                         

                          BILLY

                          BILLY
           Okay.

           It's a big day, you won't forget it.

           It's fifteen minutes before the game as some executives
           have their picture taken on the field with BILLY.

                          BILLY
           Hey, great to see you. Thanks for coming
           out. Got a good box? You want a
           picture? Sure, let me step in there.
           Great, big smiles now. Big smiles. Know
           what I like about opening day?
           Everyone's even. Thank you. You all
           enjoy the game.

                         
           BILLY gets his picture taken with KIDS from an area
           Little League team. He's laughing and being a good host.

                          BILLY
           Hey, how you guys doing. So you won?
           That's great. What position are you?
           How's your fastball? 92? Alright,

           BILLY greeting some VIP's in their field-level seats.
           Throughout this we'll hear bits of talk radio.

           HOST #1 (FROM RADIO)
           With the departure of head scout Grady
           Fuson and a roster that I'll describe as
           unusual, if not eccentric, you have to
           wonder what Billy Beane is thinking.
           BILLY catches a glance of ELIZABETH HATTEBERG taking her
           seat nearby.

                         
           In the family area, Elizabeth introduces herself to Tara.

                          ELIZABETH
           Hi, I'm Elizabeth.

           sound off but we can hear the live crowd in the stadium.
           CRACK--a TEXAS RANGER hits a three-run homer and BILLY
           walks out of the room and

                          CUT TO:

                         

          60 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - DAY - ARCHIVAL VIDEO 60


                         
           An OAKLAND A hits an easy pop-up to center field and

                         

                          CUT TO:

          61 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - DAY 61


                         
           Where BILLY's on a stationary bike. His blackberry buzzes
           and he takes a look--

                         
           "Fly out to cntr"

                         

                          CUT TO:

          62 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - DAY 62

           Where BILLY's bench pressing and CRACK--

                         

                          CUT TO:

                         

          63 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - DAY - ARCHIVAL VIDEO 63


                         
           Where an OAKLAND A has just hit a ground ball to the
           SHORTSTOP, who tosses it easily to second for the first
           out, and the SECOND BASEMAN throws it over to first for--

                          CUT TO:

                         

          64 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - DAY 64


                         
           Where BILLY looks at the blackberry which now says--

           75.

           75.

                         

                         

                          "643 DBL PLAY"

                         
           The blackberry goes crashing into the wall and blows
           apart.

                          CUT TO:

                         

          65 INT. LOCKER ROOM/AREA OUTSIDE ART'S OFFICE - NIGHT 65

           We find Billy and Art in conversation.

                         

                          BILLY
           Yeah. I should have made you a bigger
           part of the conversation, I should have
           had you in the scout meetings from the
           first day, that way you would have
           understood this better and that was
           another mistake, I take full
           responsibility.

                         

                          ART
           What are you trying to say?

                          BILLY
           It doesn't matter what moves I make if
           you don't play the team the way I need
           them played.

                         

                          ART

                          BILLY -

                          (LONG BEAT)
           You are out of your depth.

                          BILLY
           Why wasn't Hatteberg at first?

                         

                          ART
           Because he can't play first.

                          BILLY
           How do you know?

                         

                          ART
           Not my first baseball game.

                          BILLY

                          ART--

                         

                          ART
           Scott Hatteberg can't hit.

                         

                          BILLY
           He gets on--

           76.

           76.

                         

                         

                          ART
           And his defense--

                         

                          BILLY
           Still keeps us in the plus column and we
           only need to be 7 over 500.

                         

                          ART
           Anything else?

                         

                          BILLY
           Yeah, I would have rather seen Chad
           Bradford in there at the end than
           Magnante.

                          ART

                          BRADFORD'S--

                          BILLY
           I don't care about righty/lefty.

                         

                          ART
           I do.

                         

                          BILLY
           This is about your contract?

                          ART
           No, you've made it clear what you think
           about that. This is about you doing your
           job and me doing mine. Mine's being left
           alone to manage the beer league team you
           assembled for me.

                         

                          BILLY
           I didn't assemble them for you, I
           assembled them for me.

                         

                          ART
           No shit.

          66 INT. BILLY'S OFFICE - DAY 66


                         

                          BILLY
           I want you to go on the road with the
           team.

                          PETER
           You don't go on the road with the team.

                          BILLY
           That's why I want you to do it.

                         

                          PETER
           Why don't you?

           77.

           77.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
          I don't want to develop personal
          relationships. I need to trade them, send
          them down and sometimes cut them. You
          should learn how to do that by the way.

                          PETER
          The only way I'd have to cut a player is
          if you oh come on!

                         

                          BILLY
          Yeah, let's practice.

                         

                          PETER
          No.

                          BILLY
          I'm a player, cut me from the roster.

                         

                          PETER
          No.

                         

                          BILLY
          Do it.

                         

                          PETER
          This is stupid.

                         

                          BILLY
          Man-up, Yale.

                         

                          PETER
          Fine. Billy, would you have a seat for a
          moment, I need to talk to you.

                          BILLY
          I'm already sitting.

                          PETER
          I was pretending you weren't sitting.

                         

                          BILLY
          But I am. Keep going.

                          PETER
          This is the hardest thing there is to do
          in baseball.

                          BILLY
          You got that from Bull Durham?

                         

                          PETER
          Yeah.

           78.

           78.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
          Hitting a curve ball is the hardest thing
          there is to do in baseball but go ahead.

                         

                          PETER
          You've been a huge part of this team but
          decisions have to be made that are best
          for the team, I'm sure you can understand
          that.

                         

                          BILLY
          You're cutting me?

                         

                          PETER
          I'm really sorry.

                          BILLY
          I just bought a house here.

                          PETER

                          (BEAT)
          Well...

                         

                          BILLY
          Well? That's all you have to say? My kids
          just started at a new school, they made
          friends.

                         

                          PETER
          That's--I'd leave them in school, you
          don't want to take them out in the middle

                         OF THE--

                         

                          BILLY
          What the hell are you doing?

                          PETER
          Are you you or the player?

                         

                          BILLY
          I'm me. You're talking about kids and
          schools and you should've been out of the
          room three minutes ago.

                         

                          PETER
          Shouldn't I tell them that they'll always
          be a part of the A's family?

                         

                          BILLY
          That makes me feel so good I'm thinking
          of burning your house down with you in
          it. These are professional baseball
          players. You just do it. "Peter, I need
          to let you go. Jack's office'll handle
          the paperwork."

                          PETER
           That's it?

                         

                          BILLY
           Would you rather get one bullet in the
           head or five in the chest and bleed to
           death?

                         

                          PETER
           Those are my only choices?

                         

                          BILLY
           Go on the road with the team.

                          DAVID
           How come your boss doesn't travel with
           the team?

                          PETER
           He doesn't like to mingle with the
           players.

                          DAVID
           Makes us easier to cut?

           He's gonna make some moves if we keep
           losing.
           PETER gives a small "Yeah" shrug...

                          BILLY
           Nope.

                         
           CASEY emerges from the gate, sees her father before he
           sees her and runs to him. They hug.

                          CASEY
           Hey, Dad.

                          BILLY
           Hey, honey... I'm glad to see you.

           BILLY and PETER are throwing a ball through their office
           doors on either side of the hallway--

                          PETER
           It's not a big enough sample yet. I want
           to wait until we play more games.

           Casey sits at the table as Billy scoops ice cream.

                          BILLY
           Do you want strawberry or vanilla?

                         

                          CASEY
           Both.

                         

                          BILLY
           Don't tell your mother.

                          (THEN)
           If you could only have one ice cream for
           the rest of your life, which would you
           choose?

           Vanilla. Definitely vanilla.

                         

                          BILLY
           Interesting. Chocolate sauce?

                          CASEY
           Yup.
          A beat. Then --

                         

                          CASEY
           Dad... if you could choose between the
           power of invisibility or flight, which
           would you choose?

                          BILLY
           Flight. Yeah, I'd wanna fly. You?

                          CASEY
           I think I'd want invisibility.

                         

                          BILLY
           Really? Why?

                         

                          CASEY
           I don't know. People wouldn't notice me
           as much.

                         

                          BILLY
           Why wouldn't you want people to notice
           you?

                         

                          CASEY
           I don't know.

                          BILLY
           Well, I guess you could sneak up on
           people. Or eavesdrop on their
           conversations. You could be a spy.

                          (THEN)
           So how's school?

                         

                          CASEY
           My teacher's kinda mean. She doesn't
           like us to ask questions.

                          BILLY
           What kind of teacher doesn't let you ask
           questions?

                         

                          CASEY
           I know, right? Mom was mad, too. She
           thinks maybe I should be home schooled.

           83.

                          BILLY
           Wouldn't you miss your friends?

                         

                          CASEY
           Yeah. But the other kids are mean.

                          BILLY
           There are always going to be bullies.
           Try not to let them get to you. But let
           me know if it's becoming a problem.

                         

                          CASEY
           Can I ask you a question? Are you still
           chewing tobacco?

                          BILLY
           Yeah...

                          CASEY
           Please stop.

                         

                          BILLY
           I know, it's terrible. Look, I promise
           I'll quit in November if you promise not
           to worry about it.

                          CASEY
           Pinkie swear?

                          (PAUSE)
           You feel like what?

                          (BEAT)
           I don't know, did we talk enough this

           Anything. Did we talk about the things
           you want to talk about, did we have fun?

           You're doing it right now.

                          BILLY
           You're worrying about me.

           Sorry.

                          BILLY

           those things crash all the time. Will
           you please stop worrying about your
           father? You're a kid, I can't have it.

                          CASEY
           Okay. Can I worry about the airplane now
           though?

                         

                          BILLY
           Absolutely.

           We're all set.

                          BILLY
           Great.

                         
           There's a slightly awkward moment and CASEY isn't sure
           whether she's supposed to hug her father again and so
           they do a sort of half-hug.

                         

                          BILLY
           I love you.
           BILLY watches her go off with the attendant, feeling like
           it was an unsatisfying visit.

                         
           He looks at his blackberry--
           3-2. Magnante in.

           No! WHY IS HE IN THERE?!

                         
           EVERYONE in the area stops to look at the madman.

                          SCHOTT
           Peter. Guys, give me some idea of what's
           going on out there.

                          BILLY
          Listen, it's a team of probabilities, and
          we're gonna need 162 games to tell that
          tale in a nascent form. It's phase one,
          we're evolving and we feel confident
          where we're heading.

                         

                          SCHOTT

                         BILLY -

          We're not scared.

                         

                          SCHOTT
          3 out of 17 games. 3. We're getting
          crucified in the press. What makes you
          think this is gonna turn around?

                          BILLY
          Because I believe in what we're doing. I
          believe the numbers. I believe the record
          doesn't accurately reflect the team and
          where we're going to be at the end of the
          season. Peter and I feel very strongly
          that we need to stick to the game plan,
          and you can tell your partners to start
          booking their tickets to the playoffs.

                         

                          SCHOTT
          Billy, look, you've got guys who are
          nearly crippled, who couldn't get hired
          as an usher in a ballpark now playing on
          the team. Give me something I can go back
          to these guys with and feel like I have
          the confidence that you're gonna turn
          these things around.

                         

                          BILLY
          With all due respect you asked me to
          build a team with shoelaces and gum
          wrappers and we've done it.

                         

                          SCHOTT
          You haven't done it yet billy.

                         

                          BILLY
          And it will pay off. Stick with us.
          Suffer the blows. Listen, life with no
          money means we're gonna have to suffer a
          few embarrassments along the way, but we
          are okay in the end.

                         

                          SCHOTT
          Billy, there's a lot of money at stake
          here.

           Where do we expect to be mid July All
           Star break?

                          PETER
           Our goal and our expectation by the All
           Star break is to be within seven games of
           first place.

                         

                          BILLY
           That'll keep us in the hunt.

                         

                          PETER
           And that would be this working
           exceptionally well.

           7 within 500. By July. And what's going
           to keep us from getting there?

                         

                          BILLY
           Nothing Steve.

                          SCHOTT
           Nothing. We're 3 for 17 right now. You've
           got to be able to give me a little bit
           more to go back to my partners with.

                          BILLY
           Listen, you hired me to do this job and
           that's where we're going to be.

                         

                          SCHOTT
           That's not good enough.

                          BILLY
           Well, let's go buy Barry Bonds, then.
           This is the team we've got and this is
           the team we'll win with.

           Billy, put yourself in my shoes. What do
           you imagine is going to happen if things
           don't turn around?

                          BILLY
           It's very clear, Steve. If I put myself
           in your shoes, I'd spend another 20
           million on the team.

                         

                          SCHOTT
           We don't have another 20 million

                         

                          BILLY
           I'm just kidding, Steve, I'm just
           kidding. We've got the team.

                         

                          SCHOTT
           I gotta be honest with you, Billy, I wish
           you had a little more worry and a little
           more fear. Because things aren't going in
           our direction right now.

                         

                          BILLY
           162 games Steve.

                          SCHOTT
           Let's hope the next 30 are better than
           the last 30.

                          BILLY
           I don't need to hope.

                         

                          SCHOTT

           ART, as he always does, is watching not from the railing
           but from the bench.

                         
           BILLY walks into the dugout without saying hello.

                          BILLY
           We're not gonna lose three at home to the
           Orioles.

          I want Dye in right, Justice DH-ing, Pena
          on the bench, Hatteberg at first and
          anyone but Magnante first out of the pen.

                         

                          ART
          You want Pena on the bench?

                         

                          BILLY
          That's right. So that you can play
          Hatteberg.

          Hatte - as opposed to the guy who's going
          to win Rookie of the Year.

                          BILLY
          No, Hatte - as opposed to the guy who
          gets on base less. Pena getting voted
          Rookie of the Year and the A's making the
          playoffs are two entirely different--

                         

                          ART
          Pena's not just the best first baseman on
          the roster, he's the only first baseman
          on the roster and the most valuable
          member on this team.

                          BILLY
          Not according to, what do you call `em,
          facts.

                         HATTEBERG--

                         

                          BILLY
          Listen to me--gets on base more than
          Pena. 25% more.

                         

                          ART

                         HIS FIELDING--

                          BILLY
          His fielding doesn't matter.

                         

                          ART
          It does matter and Pena only has one
          error in 70 games.

                         

                          BILLY
          Not only is that number statistically
          insignificant but it's also subjective.
          It measures what someone did against what
          someone else thought they were supposed
          to do.

           Part of the conversation? I've heard
           enough of the conversation and I disagree
           with you, plain and simple. Moreover, I
           strongly believe that you're in the
           middle of experiencing some sort of
           personal crisis and you seem indifferent
           to the fact that you're taking a whole
           organization down with you. I'm playing
           my team in a way I can explain in job
           interviews this winter.

                         
           Some As players arrive in the dugout, causing Billy to
           hold his tongue. He simply says -

           Hatte, not Pena.

           The game plays silently on the TV as Billy lifts weights.

           inside it with a towel around his neck. He hesitates,
           then goes in and we follow him. Billy says nothing, but
           his silence is worse. Art has to break it -

                          ART
           It's just one game.

                          BILLY
           That's the point, you think?

           The point is always tomorrow's game.

                         

                          BILLY
           No, the point - as you said - is to win.

           Yeah!

                         
           He's not even aware of Billy. It's just like any other
           night as far as Jeremy Giambi is concerned. He dances to
           a CD of funk music as he dresses, until he becomes aware
           of Billy standing there, and smiling, he kills the music.

                          PETER
           Cruz -- .283, .347, .476. Stevens --
           .244, .349, .560. Miner -- .272, .349,
           .499. Hanson -- .280, .363, .450.
           Baretta -- .273, .354, .497. Durazo --
           .292, .395, .621. What do you think?

                          (THEN)
           Billy?

                         

           BILLY (V.O.)

                          (BEAT)
           I don't know where I am.

                          PETER
           You okay?

           BILLY (V.O.)
           I missed my exit.

                         

                          CUT TO:

           Billy takes the next off ramp and as LIGHTS FLARE on the
           windshield, we transition to ANOTHER TIME, YOUNG BILLY

                          DRIVING --

                         

          B97 INT. CAR - MOVING - NIGHT - 1989 B97

           Billy and his wife drive home from a game in silence,
           their infant daughter Casey asleep in a car seat in back.
           Sharon regards Billy's hands, clutched too tightly to the
           steering wheel.

                         

                          SHARON
           Have you thought about what you might do
           if baseball doesn't work out?

                         

                          BILLY

                          (PAUSE)
           What?

                         

                          SHARON
           That was too abrupt.

           95.

           95.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           No.

                          (PAUSE)
           What?

                          SHARON

                          (BEAT)
           If baseball doesn't work out. Have you
           thought about what you might do?

                         

                          BILLY

                          (BEAT)
           The game's only been over for three
           hours, I haven't had that much time to
           think about it.

                          SHARON
           Sure.

                          (BEAT)
           Maybe real estate.

                         

                          BILLY
           I'll be honest, if I don't make it in
           baseball I don't think I'm going to be
           able to afford much real estate.

                          SHARON

                          I MEANT--

                         

                          BILLY
           I know what you meant.

                         

                          SHARON

                          (PAUSE)
           It's just a slump, right?

                          BILLY

                          (BEAT)
           No.

                          SHARON
           You're saying every scout was wrong?

                         

                          BILLY
           You're kind of saying it too.

                          SHARON

                          BILLY--

                          BILLY
           Honey...don't you think you should
           divorce me now while you're young?

                         
          SHARON looks at him... then her eyes go to the window.

          98 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - CORRIDOR - DAY 98

           Billy shoves a wad of Copenhagen under his lip as he and
           Peter walk-and-talk.

                          BILLY
           Get me Wade.

                         

                          PETER
           Why.

                          BILLY
           Get him.

                         

                          PETER
           Why.

                          BILLY
           Get him.

                         

          A99 INT. BILLY'S OFFICE - DAY A99

           Billy's seated at his desk. Peter reluctantly dials a
           number from a list, the number across from the Phillies'
           GM's name. It connects on the speaker.

                         

           WADE V/O
           Hello?

                         

                          BILLY
           Ed. Billy. I need some help on defense
           and I'm willing to trade Jeremy Giambi
           for it.

                         

                          PETER
           No, you (aren't) -

                         

                          BILLY
           (ignoring Peter; to

                          WADE)
           Who you got?

           97.

           97.

                         

                         

           WADE V/O
          Let me think.

                         

                          PETER
          What are you doing? Jeremy's doing

                         (GREAT) -

                         

                          BILLY
          Cleaning house.

                         

           WADE V/O
          Maybe?

                         

                          BILLY
          Maybe what?

           WADE V/O
          No. Mabry.

                          BILLY
          Hang on.
           (put the call on

                          HOLD)
          Mabry?

                         

                          PETER
          I don't know.

                         

                          BILLY
          Yes, you do.

                          PETER
          Runs hot and cold, Billy. Impossible to
          know what we're going to get. He's a crap
          shoot. He's exactly the kind of player
          we're not looking for.

                         

                          BILLY
           (into the phone)
          He'll be fine, Ed.

           WADE V/O
          Why do I get the feeling you're picking
          my pocket?

                         

                          BILLY
          I'm not picking your pocket, you're
          picking mine. Giambi's name alone is
          worth more than Mabry.

           WADE V/O
          You realize -

           98.

           98.

                         

                         

                          BILLY

                          (INTO PHONE)
           I do. His career is stagnant, to put it
           nicely. Can we say it's done in theory
           and start drawing up paperwork?

           WADE V/O
           Okay. But -

                          BILLY
           Great.

                         
          He hangs up.

                         

                          PETER
           I think he was going to say something
           else.

                          BILLY
           Peter. Rule Number 3: When you get the
           answer you're looking for - hang up.
           That's done, and in a minute Pena's going
           to Detroit.

                         

                          PETER
           I don't think you want to do that.

                          BILLY
           Art can't put him at first if he's
           playing for the Tigers and I want Hatte
           in the lineup tonight.

                         

                          PETER
           Maybe you should think about this.
           You're upset and this is - this -

                          BILLY
           What am I missing?

                         

                          PETER
           It's just a very hard move to explain.
           People are going to think you've lost
           your mind.

                         

                          BILLY
           Why's that a problem Peter?
          Beat.

                          PETER
           Don't make an emotional decision Billy.

                         

                          SUZANNE
           David Dombrowski's on 3.

           99.

           99.

                         

                         
          Billy picks up the call.

                         

                          BILLY

                          (TO PETER)
           Sometimes you have to shake it up.

                          (INTO PHONE)
           David, Peña's going on the blocks,
           you're my first call... because he's
           making the rest of the team look bad...
           He's going to be rookie of the year...

                         

                          PETER
           (not eager to help
           but...)
           Probably an all star.

                          BILLY
           He's an all star Dave...
           (winks at Peter,

                          LISTENS)
           It's more like he's creating self-esteem
           problems for the other guys... No, I'm
           looking for a reliever and some cash...
           Ok... five minutes Dave, I'm not waiting.

                          (HANGS UP)
           What's the problem?

                          PETER
           (trying to slow it

                          DOWN)
           Billy, Peña is an all star. If you dump
           him, and if Hatte doesn't work out, you
           know, this is the kind of decision that
           gets you fired.

                          BILLY
           Why you worrying about my job?

                          (BEAT)
           You worried about my job or yours?

                          PETER

                          (BEAT)
           I'm worried about yours.

                         

                          BILLY
           Well you should be worrying about yours
           because if this thing we're doing don't
           work... neither of us have jobs.

                          PETER
           That's probably true.

           100.

           100.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           In which case I'm a 44 year old guy with
           a high-school diploma and a daughter who
           I'd like to be able to put through
           college one day.
           (lets it sink in)
           You're 25 years old with a degree from
           Yale and a pretty impressive
           apprenticeship.

                          (BEAT)
           I don't think we're asking the right
           question. I think the question we're
           supposed to be asking now is, do you
           believe in what we're doing or not?

                          (BEAT)
           It's a problem that you think we need to
           explain ourselves. Don't... to anyone.
           I'm going to see this through, for better
           or for worse. Just tell me, do you
           project we'll win more games with Peña or
           Hatteberg on first?

                         

                          PETER
           It's close Billy but theoretically
           Hatteberg.

                          BILLY
           What are we talking about then?

                         
          The phone rings.

                          BILLY
           Dave.

                          (LISTENS)
           That works. Great. There's just one more
           thing I need. I don't want the guys
           paying for soda--I want you to stock my
           soda machine for three years. Uh huh, uh
           huh, great... then that's a deal.
          Billy hangs up. He stares at Peter.

                         

                          PETER
           That was thoughtful.

                         

                          BILLY
           Yeah. Okay. You gotta tell Pena to pack.

                         

                          PETER
           You want me to tell Pena he's been
           traded?

                         

                          BILLY
           Be a man.

           101.

           101.

                         

                         

                          PETER
           What about Jeremy? Am I telling him,
           too.

                         

                          BILLY
           No. I'll do that.

                         

          B99 INT. LOCKER ROOM B99

           Peter walks into the locker room. Sees Pena talking to a
           couple of other players. He approaches Pena.

                          PETER
           Hey, Carlos.

                         

                          PENA
           Yeah.

                          PETER
           Can I get a moment with you?

                         

                          PENA
           Sure.

                         

                          PETER
           Okay, maybe we can talk over here.

                         
           They walk awkwardly to the players' lounge.

                          PETER
           Have a seat.
           They sit.

                         

                          PETER
           So, um, Carlos, you've been traded to the
           Tigers. This is the number of Jay Palmer,
           their travel secretary. He's expecting
           your call. He'll help you arrange travel
           to Detroit.

                         
           Pena sits and stares at him. It's excruciating for Peter,
           awkward, until --

                         

                          PENA
           Is that all?

                          PETER
           Yeah.

                          PENA
           Cool.

                         
           Pena just takes it. Picks up the number and leaves.

           102.

           102.

                         

                         

          99 INT. ART'S OFFICE - LATER - DAY 99


                         
           Billy knocks and lets himself in.

                         

                          BILLY
           Mind if I have a seat.

                          ART
           Please.

                          BILLY
           You can't start Pena at first tonight,
           you'll have to start Hatteberg.

                         

                          ART
           I don't want to go 15 rounds, Billy, the
           line-up card is mine and that's all.

                          BILLY
           The line-up card is definitely yours, I'm
           just saying you can't start Pena at
           first.

                         

                          ART
           I am starting Pena at first.

                          BILLY
           I don't think so, he plays for the
           Detroit Tigers now.

                         

                          ART

                          (PAUSE)
           You traded Pena?!

                         

                          BILLY
           Along with German, Hiljus and Jeremy
           Giambi.

                         

                          ART
           You are outside your fucking mind.

                         
           Art stares at him in a silence broken by Jeremy Giambi
           knocking on the open door.

                         

                          BILLY
           Jeremy, come on in.

                         
           Billy jots a phone number on an A's Post-It and hands it
           to him.

                         

                          BILLY
           This is Ed Wade's number. You know him?

                         
           Art looks sick.

           103.

           103.

                         

                         

                          JEREMY
           No.

                         

                          BILLY
           Phillies General Manager. Real nice guy.
           Give him a call - he's expecting it - say
           hello - then talk to Futterman about
           arranging a flight for you.

                          JEREMY
           The what?

                         

                          BILLY
           The flight. To Philadelphia.
          Billy gets up and shakes his hand.

                         

                          BILLY
           It's been a real pleasure, Jeremy. I
           mean that. You're a great ballplayer and
           great guy.

                         
          Jeremy, not sure he heard right, looks at the Post-It in
          his hand as Billy escorts him to the door.

                         

                          BILLY
           We're going to miss you.

                         
          Jeremy leaves. Billy looks at Art from the door.

                          BILLY
           Adkins is gone, too.

                         

                          ART
           You're killing this team.

                          BILLY
           Art? I can do this all day long.

                         
          He leaves. Art notices Peter, who had been lurking by the
          door, eavesdropping.

                         

                          ART
           What are you looking at?

                         

                          PETER
           I'm not looking at anything.

                          ART
           You went along with this? You agree with
           this bullshit?

                         

                          PETER

                          (BEAT)
           A hundred percent.

          A100 INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY A100


                         
           Pena cleans out his locker. Several players stop by to
           say goodbye. Tejada --

                         

                          TEJADA
           Keep your head up, okay? It's part of
           the business. You're gonna be a great
           player, okay?

                          PENA
           Thank you, man.

                         

                          TEJADA
           Don't let this bother you at all.

                         
           Chad Bradford --

                          CHAD
           Nice to meet you, brother. Take care
           and... God bless you, man.

                         

                          PENA
           Thank you.

                         
           Scott Hatteberg --

                         

                          HATTEBERG
           You're the best first baseman here. It's
           not right, Carlos.

                         

                          PENA
           Thank you, Hattie.

                         

                          HATTEBERG
           Yeah.

          100 INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY 100


                         
           BILLY and PETER stride through as the team is getting
           dressed for batting practice.
           The place quiets down as BILLY comes in. They've all
           heard the news and they've never experienced a move like
           this in their careers.

                         

                          BILLY

                          (CALLING OUT)
           Scottie H.!

                          SCOTT
           Yes sir.

                         

                          BILLY
           Go out and field some grounders.

           105.

           105.

                         

                         
           BILLY looks around at the PLAYERS, who are looking at
           Billy...

                         

                          BILLY
           Everybody, listen up. You may not look
           like a winning ball team. In fact, you
           look nothing like a winning ball team.
           But you are one. So play like one
           tonight. You'll get further instructions
           tomorrow.

                          CUT TO:

                         

          101 EXT. THE FIELD - NIGHT (HYBRID) 101

           DAVID JUSTICE hits a single up the middle as the runners
           on 2nd and 3rd round the bases to score.

                         

          102 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - SAME TIME 102

           BILLY's blackberry buzzes.

                         
           "Sngl up the mdl--2 rns scr"

                          BILLY
           Okay.

                         

          A103 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - NIGHT A103

           Billy talks to Chavez and Ellis. Peter stands nearby.

                         

                          BILLY
           No more bunts.

                         

                          CHAVEZ
           No more bunts?

                          BILLY
           A bunt is an out. You're paid to avoid
           outs, not make them.

                         

                          CHAVEZ
           A bunt isn't an out. It's a sacrifice.

                          BILLY
           A bunt is for pitchers and weak hitters.
           You're not a pitcher, Chavvie, so what
           are you saying?

                          (THEN)
           Until the third out, anything can happen.
           After the third out, it's over. You
           gotta protect your outs like they're your
           children. Every out's precious, don't
           give `em away.

                          (THEN)

                          BILLY (CONT'D)
           Another thing -- you should see more
           pitches. We wanna get into their
           bullpen. Deep into their bullpen. We
           want to see 100 pitches by the end of the
           5th inning. You wanna get your at-bats
           off their 10th and 11th pitcher.

                         

                          ELLIS
           You want us to walk more. How much more?

                         

                          BILLY
           Pete?

                         

                          PETER
           At least once every ten at bats.

                          ELLIS
           Or...?

                          BILLY
           Triple-A Sacramento's only 80 miles away.
           And there's no flights.
           (as they look to

                          PETER)
           Don't look at him. Here's the deal. I'm
           not interested in what you think you know
           about baseball, or what you think I don't
           know about it. I'm not interested in
           guts or heart or determination or
           anything else the fans or your mothers
           love about you. I'm interested in you
           getting on base. If you do that, we win.
           If you don't, we lose. And I hate to
           lose. I hate to lose more than I need to
           win. There's a difference.

                         

          B103 INT. VIDEO ROOM - DAY B103

           Billy and Peter give advice to Dye and Byrnes.

                          PETER
           Every at bat is like a hand of blackjack.
           Every card that's dealt, your odds
           completely change. For instance, every
           first pitch strike, your batting average
           goes down about 75 points.

                          BILLY
           75 points.

                          PETER
           75 points. Every first pitch ball, it
           goes up about the same amount. So you
           gotta lay off the first pitch.

           107.

           107.

                         

                         

                          BYRNES
           First pitch curveball or first pitch
           fastball?

                         

                          PETER
           First pitch period. When you swing at
           the first pitch you're batting .140.

                         

                          BILLY
           We want to see more pitches.

                         

                          DYE
           How many pitches?

                         

                          PETER
           Every starter, we want to see 100 pitches
           by the 5th inning.

                          DYE
           So... 5, 6 pitches per at bat?

                         

                          PETER
           Yeah. I mean, Hatteberg drained 38
           pitches.

                         

                          BILLY
           And Byrnsie, you're hackin' at
           everything. You're all squirrely out
           there. Wait for your pitch, man. This
           is a war of attrition. There's no clock
           on this thing. Wait `em out. Let them
           make the mistakes. And when your enemy's
           making mistakes -- don't interrupt them.

           Peter advises Durham as he works out.

                          PETER
           Basically, these are all your at bats.
           This is you versus righties, you versus
           lefties... and then, of course, all your
           count knowledge, okay? In an 0-0 count
           you're batting .290. In an 0-1 you
           average .238. In a 0-2, .159. When
           you're 1-0, you're batting .324.
           Understand what I'm saying?

                          DURHAM
           Not really.

                         

                          PETER
           I know, it's a lot of math. When your
           first pitch is a strike, your batting
           average goes down about 70 points.

                          PETER (CONT'D)
           When it's a ball, it goes up about 30.
           If you draw a ball on your first pitch,
           you're unstoppable. If you strike on the
           first pitch, you might as well be jumping
           off cliff. I'm trying to get you to lay
           off the first pitch.

                         

                          DURHAM
           But I'm a first pitch hitter. I like to
           swing at fastballs.

                         

                          PETER
           And that's the way you've been trained.
           But it's a habit we'd like to break you
           from. We're trying to design the game to
           your strengths. This has nothing to do
           with you being a great hitter -- you're a
           great hitter. We just want to get you on
           base.

                         

                          DURHAM
           But if I get my pitch, I'm gonna swing at
           it, no matter what the count is.

                         

                          PETER
           I'm not worried about you crushing the
           ball out of the park. I just want you to
           lay off anything that will result in a
           strike.

                          DURHAM
           I guess I'll have to watch some film and
           take a look at it.

                         

                          PETER
           Absolutely. The video room is open to
           you any time, I'm always available.

           -- But seriously. Make him use up all
           his bullets.

                          BILLY
           Yeah, make him work.

           I'm screwin' with you, Haddie.

                         

                          HATTEBERG
           So we just don't steal?

                          BILLY
           That's right.

                          LONG
           That's what I do. That's what you pay me
           to do.

                          BILLY
           No, I pay you to get on first, not get
           thrown out at second.

                         

                          LONG
           I don't get thrown out much.

           I don't hit on 17 at the blackjack table,
           but if I did, the odds would be the same.

                          PETER
           You've actually gotten caught 6 out of 17
           tries this season.

                         

                          LONG
           I get 11 of 17. That's not bad.

                          BILLY
           You just handed them an out. Protect
           your outs like they're your children.
           There's no clock on this game. Until the
           third out, anything can happen. Get on
           base and let the next guy move you up.
           Pass the torch, pass the torch. We're

           Hey, Dave. I've been thinking... I want
           you to --

                          JUSTICE
           You gonna teach me something?

                          BILLY
           You've never seen a GM who was a player.

                          JUSTICE
           Huh.

                          BILLY
           Is there a problem?

                         

                          JUSTICE
           It's okay, man. I know your routine. It's
           a patter, it's rap, it's for effect.
           That's okay. But it's for them, it's not
           for me.

                         

                          BILLY
           You're special?

                          JUSTICE
           You're paying me 7 million bucks so I
           guess I am a little.

                         

                          BILLY
           As a matter of fact I'm not paying you 7
           million bucks, David. The Yankees are
           paying half your salary. That's what the
           New York Yankees think of you.

                          BILLY
           You're almost 37, Dave. Almost as old as
           me. Let's be honest with each other
           about what we each want. I want to milk
           the last ounce of baseball you have left
           in you, and you want to stay in the show.
           So let's do that. I'm not paying you to
           be the player you used to be, I'm paying
           you to be the player you are now. You're
           smart, you know what's going on here. I
           need you to set an example for the
           younger guys. Take a leadership role.

                         
          Justice just studies him ... then nods.

                          BILLY
           All right.
          Billy starts to leave, but has one last thought for him --

                          BILLY
           You know -- the Yankees are coming to
           town. If it were me -- I'd want to take
           that three point five and shove it up
           their ass. But I'm a competitor.

           He's managing this unorthodox team in an
           unorthodox way. They are not bunting.

           You guys stop distracting him.

           Chavvie -- you couldn't hit that shit
           with a boat paddle last night. You gotta
           see more pitches. Patience.

          112 INT. ART'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 112


                         
           BILLY knocks on Art's door -- something we haven't seen
           him do before.
           ART can see BILLY through the window blinds and is a
           little surprised at the courtesy of a knock.

                         

                          ART
           Come in.
           BILLY does. He's going to try to do this nicely.

                         

                          BILLY
           How are ya?

                         

                          ART
           Good. You knocked.

                         

                          BILLY
           I did, and I hope you take it as a show
           of respect.

                         

                          ART
           We'll see.

           115.

           115.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
          You look good.

                         

                          ART
          We've won 7 in a row, what am I doing
          wrong now?

                         

                          BILLY
          Absolutely nothing.

                         

                          ART
          Good.

                         

                          BILLY
          But.

                          ART
          Yeah.

                          BILLY
          Magnante's having some head problems.

                         

                          ART
          Head problems.

                         

                          BILLY
          Yeah.

                         

                          ART
          Okay.

                          BILLY
          He's 37 and he's got three blown saves in
          two weeks. Everytime he winds up he's
          thinking he's about to throw the last
          pitch of his life. So he grips it a
          little hard.

                         

                          ART
          I appreciate this.

                          BILLY
          Sure.

                         

                          ART
          But I know my bullpen.

                          BILLY
          Yes you do. Yes you absolutely do. No
          question about it. Except not really.

                         

                          ART
          Yeah?

           116.

           116.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           If we have a lead late in the game and
           they have runners on base, I'd rather not
           see Magnante out of the bullpen.

                          ART
           I'll make that decision when the time
           comes.

                          BILLY
           That's what you should do. Baseball's a
           game of situations and you should make
           the decision when the time comes. Except
           you should make it now.

                          ART

                          LOOK--

                          BILLY
           Don't bring Magnante out if we've gotta
           hold a late lead with runners on. He's
           37, he's scared shitless of being the guy
           who blows this winning streak.

                         

                          ART
           You think a lot of yourself, don't you?

                          BILLY
           I......think the regular amount of
           myself. Magnante on the other hand, he
           doesn't think very much of himself at
           all, and when he tightens up we've got
           ourselves an adventure. So I'd like to
           see Chad Bradford out of the pen tonight
           when we're in, let's say, just to make it
           easier for you, any situation.
           Righty/lefty, two outs, no outs, the
           umpires have decided we're going to
           finish the game by playing darts,
           whatever. Bradford's the first guy out of
           the pen.

                          (BEAT)
           Okay?

                         
          ART regards BILLY for a moment...

                         

                          ART
           I could've coached you up, you know.

                          BILLY
           I don't think so.

                         

                          ART
           You think you went as far as you could
           have?

           117.

           117.

                         

                         

                          BILLY

                          (PAUSE)
           Yeah, that's what I meant. Play Bradford.

                         
           BILLY steps out of Art's office into--

                         

          113 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - LATER - NIGHT 113

           The game plays on TV as BILLY bench presses. The A's are
           up by three runs in the ninth inning but the Indians have
           a runner on first.

                         
           Through the tunnel, BILLY can hear the crack of the bat
           and a collective groan from the stands.

                         
           BILLY holds the barbell in the air--frozen--as he simply
           looks at the T.V. and sees the silent images.

                         

          114 EXT. FIELD - NIGHT (HYBRID) 114

           ART HOWE walking to the mound, tapping his left hand.

                         
           MAGNANTE heading to the mound.

          115 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - NIGHT 115


                         
           We think BILLY's going to trash the weights, but he
           simply returns the barbell to the bracket, sits up and
           watches the silent images.

                         

          116 EXT. FIELD - NIGHT (HYBRID) 116


                         
           MAGNANTE mops his brow, squints for the sign, winds up
           and makes his pitch. It misses low for ball four and
           PEDRO walks to first.

                         

          117 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - NIGHT 117

           Billy lays back on the bench, breathes, then unmutes the
           T.V. and we hear -

           ANNOUNCER (FROM TV)
           Magnante has quickly let two on base for
           Lee Stevens who's the go ahead run for
           the Indians in a game that Oakland
           appeared to have put away.
           And then - BILLY sits calmly...waits for it...and--

           CRACK!

                         
           --BILLY nods his head at the inevitable.

           118.

           118.

                         

                         

           ANNOUNCER (FROM TV)
           That ball is deep....way back...three run
           homer for Lee Stevens to put Cleveland
           ahead in the ninth inning...
           BILLY can hear 40,000 people booing their lungs out. He
           takes a moment, then grabs his jacket.

                         

          118 EXT. FIELD - NIGHT 118

           The FANS are booing as ART makes his way to the mound to
           take MAGNANTE out. BRADFORD makes his way from the
           bullpen and takes the ball from ART.
           ART turns to head back to the dugout but slows as he sees
           a strange sight: BILLY is standing at the dugout rail.

                         
           The plate UMPIRE notices and follows Art's line of sight.
           He sees BILLY and walks over there ahead of Art.

                         

                          UMPIRE
           You can't be in there, Billy.

                         
           BILLY doesn't move. He just watches ART as he comes into
           the dugout.

                          UMPIRE
           Billy?

                         
           The PLAYERS are watching to see what's going to happen.
           BILLY puts his hand on ART's shoulder a second as he says-

                          -

                         

                          BILLY
           Just nod a little bit--not too much--like
           I'm assuring you you didn't just make a
           calamitous vocational decision.

                         

                          UMPIRE
           Players and coaches only, Billy.

                         

                          BILLY
           (ignoring the umpire--
           still quietly to

                          ART)
           Remember that in about four seconds--
           BILLY sees one of the nearby TV cameras pivot over to
           catch this conversation--

                          BILLY
           --yeah there it is. We're the lead story
           on Sports Center now so let me be brief.
           First of all, that was an awfully costly
           fuck-you, wouldn't you say?

           119.

           119.

                          LOOK--

                         

                          BILLY
           Second of all, genius, those boos?
           They're for you. Drink up.

                         

                          UMPIRE
           Come on, Billy.

                         

                          BILLY
           Get me this game back.

                         
           As BILLY passes MAGNANTE he pats his back before we--

                          CUT TO:

                         

          119 INT. BILLY'S TRUCK - NIGHT 119

           The radio is on and the ANNOUNCER is telling us--

                         

           ANNOUNCER (FROM RADIO)
           ...after giving up the lead on a three
           run homer off Magnante, the A's came
           right back to win it in the bottom of the
           ninth with another three run homer by
           Miguel Tejada. And the A's have won eight
           in a row!

           Billy, standing at the door, surveys the room, his eyes
           moving from player to player as they're hanging up their
           street clothes. The team's equipment manager, pouring
           himself a cup of coffee, glances over -

                         

                          VOOS
           You want one, Billy?

           like a shark that knows it could die if it stops moving,
           doesn't through the entire scene --

           Suzanne, get Shapiro on the phone.

                          BILLY
           Yeah, he's lost faith for the season. I
           think he's gonna dump him.

           They wait as Suzanne dials the Indians' GM, staring at
           the speakerphone that sits like a little island in the
           middle of the conference table.

                          BILLY
           Mark. Billy. Let's be honest. A
           premiere setup man is not going to get
           you any closer to the playoffs.

                         

           SHAPIRO V/O
           Are you referring to Rincon?

                         

                          BILLY
           He's a luxury you can't afford.

           SHAPIRO V/O
           And you can? There's half a million on
           his contract and at least one other
           suitor.

                          BILLY
           By at least one, you mean one? Who is
           it?

                         

           SHAPIRO V/O
           I'd rather not say.

           121.

           121.

                         

                         

                          PETER

                          (WHISPERS)
           San Francisco.

                         

                          BILLY
           I'll call you back.

                         
          He hangs up. Stares down Peter.

                          PETER
           What do you think we can get for
           Magnante?

                         

                          BILLY
           Nothing.
           (continues to stare

                          DOWN PETER)
           What's left on Venafro's contract?

                          PETER
           Two-seventy-five.

                         

                          BILLY
           Suzanne -- get me Sabean.

                          (THEN)
           If we can get San Francisco interested in
           Venafro, Shapiro's only got one buyer for
           Rincon.

                         

                          PETER
           Us.

                         
          Pete gets busy on his computer.

                         

                          SUZANNE
           On three.

                         

                          BILLY
           Sabes. Billy. You like Venafro. I can
           let you have him for almost nothing.

           SABEAN V/O
           (smelling a rat)
           Why would you do that, Billy?

                         

                          BILLY
           Because I'm amazing.

                         

           SABEAN V/O
           Uh-huh.

                         

                          BILLY
           All I want is a couple of bucks and a
           sweetener. Throw in, say...

           122.

           122.

                         

                         
          Billy snaps his fingers at Peter --

                         

                          PETER
           Anderson.

                          BILLY
           Anderson.

                         

           SABEAN V/O
           I like Anderson.

                         

                          BILLY
           No, you don't. I don't even like him. I
           don't know why I'm doing this -- but let's
           do it anyway. Venafro for Michaelson?

                          PETER
           Anderson.

                          BILLY
           Anderson. See, I don't even know his
           name.

                         

           SABEAN V/O
           I'll think (about) --

                          BILLY
           Think about it and call me back.

                         
          He hangs up.

                          BILLY
           Get Shapiro back on.

                         
          Billy and Pete stare at each other in silence.

                          SUZANNE
           Two!

                         

                          BILLY

                          MARK --

                         

           SHAPIRO V/O
           You can't afford him, Billy.

                         

                          BILLY
           You sure about that? I get the
           impression the market for Rincon is
           softening. I could be wrong. Call
           whoever's interested and make sure
           they're still interested. And call me
           back.

                         
          He hangs up.

           123.

           123.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           What about the Mets for Venafro?

                         

                          PETER
           You just offered him to the Giants.

                          BILLY
           Suzanne -- Steve Phillips! Get me Steve
           Phillips.

                         
          Pete works his computer.

                         

                          BILLY
           Between Bonds, Nen, Kent and Snow,
           they're never gonna do it.

                          PETER
           Totally agree.

                          BILLY
           We just need them to cool on Rincon.

                         

                          SUZANNE
           Phillips on two.

                         

                          BILLY
           Steve-O. Billy. I hear you're looking
           for a left-handed reliever. What do you
           think of Venafro? I can make it quick
           and easy for you.

           PHILLIPS V/O
           What's the angle?

                         

                          BILLY
           No angle.

                         

           PHILLIPS V/O
           Who am I getting fleeced for?

                          BILLY
           Hang on a second.

                         
          He puts him on hold. Peter is already scrolling through
          the Mets' farm system, his eyes darting around the stats.

                          PETER
           Bennett maybe?

                          BILLY
           How old?

                         

                          PETER
           Twenty-six.

           124.

           124.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           Twenty-six and in Double-A? Forget it.

                         

                          PETER
           Duncan? No. Cerda? No. Furbush?

                          BILLY
           Furbush?

                          (BEAT)
           No.

                          PETER
           Eckerton? Eckerton. Eckerton, that's
           the guy.
          Billy punches the phone off hold.

                         

                          BILLY
           Eckerton.

                         

           PHILLIPS V/O
           Eckerton? I like Eckerton.

                          BILLY
           You don't even know who Eckerton is.
          The phone on Pete's desk rings. Peter answers a second
          blinking line.

                         

                          PETER
           Hello?

           PHILLIPS V/O
           Is Venafro hurt?

                         

                          PETER
           Oh, hi.

                         

                          BILLY
           No, he's not hurt. He's fine. This is
           just a situation for us.

                          PETER
           It's Steve.

                         

           PHILLIPS V/O
           Last couple of times out, he got
           hammered.

                         

                          BILLY

                          (MUTE)
           I'm on with Steve.

                          (UNMUTE)
           Not his fault. We misused him.

           125.

           125.

                         

                         

                          PETER
           Steve Schott.

                         

                          BILLY
           Tell him to hold.
           (to Steve Phillips)
           Look. Steve. Here's the deal. I'm
           being straight with you. I'm getting
           Rincon. It's a done deal. It's done.

                         

           PHILLIPS V/O
           I heard the Giants --

                         

                          BILLY
           No, the Giants want Venafro. And I told
           them they can have him for Michaelson...

                          PETER

                          ANDERSON --

                         

                          BILLY
           -- but I'd rather deal with you. Because
           you can give me Eckerton and two hundred
           and twenty-five thousand cash and the
           Giants can't.
          Billy's look to Peter says, Doesn't hurt to ask. As they
          listen to silence on Phillips' side of the call --

                         

                          PETER
           Yes, I understand it's impolite to keep
           you holding.

                         

           PHILLIPS V/O
           I'll think about it.

                          BILLY
           Of course. Think. But whoever calls me
           back first gets Venafro.
          He hangs up. Looks for the blinking light that belongs
          to his owner.

                         

                          PETER
           He hung up.

                         
          Silence. Then --

                          BILLY
           If you could have the power of flight or
           invisibility, which would you choose?

                         

                          PETER
           What?

           126.

           126.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           Invisibility or flight?

                         

                          PETER

                          (THINKS)
           Invisibility.

                         

                          BILLY
           That's what Casey said. Why?

                         

                          PETER
           You'd have total access. Besides,
           everyone else would choose flight.

                         
          Quiet.

                          BILLY
           Why isn't anybody calling?
          The phone rings.

                         

                          SUZANNE
           Shapiro's on two.

                         
          Billy picks up. Listens. Fist pump.

                          BILLY
           Great. Lemme talk to my owner. Call you
           right back.

                          (THEN)
           Get Steve.

                         

                          PETER
           Phillips or Schott?

                          BILLY
           Why would I call Phillips back? Schott.
           Tell him I'm on the other line.

                         

                          PETER
           Right.

                         
          Peter dials. Billy can't sit.

                         

                          PETER
           Mr. Schott, it's Peter Brand. Sorry I
           left you on hold. Billy asked me to call
           you back. He's on another line.

                          BILLY
           Tell him we need two hundred and twenty-
           five grand for Rincon.

           127.

           127.

                         

                         

                          PETER
           Billy says he needs two hundred and
           twenty-five thousand dollars for Ricardo
           Rincon. Please?

                          (THEN)
           Yes, I added the please.
           (listens; to Billy)
           No.
          Billy thinks intensely. Finally --

                         

                          BILLY
           Tell him I'll pay it, but when I sell him
           next year for twice that, I keep the
           money.

                          PETER
           Billy says he'll pay for Rincon himself,
           sell him next year, and keep the profit.

                         
          Peter listens to whatever Steve Schott is saying, then --

                         

                          PETER
           Okay. Thank you.

                          (HANGS UP)
           He says he'll pay for Rincon.
          High five.

                         

                          BILLY
           Great! Shit. What are we forgetting?

                          (CALLING OUT)
           Get me Shapiro!

                         
          -- as he grabs his cell phone and hits speed dial.

                          BILLY
           Wait, never mind!
           (beat, then into

                          PHONE)
           Mark. Yeah, it's Billy. Here's the
           deal. I don't want Rincon pitching
           against me tonight. Tell him to change
           his clothes. I got you the money and I
           accept your gratitude. It's done.
          He hangs up. Fist bump.

                         

                          BILLY
           We gotta let someone go. It's Mags.
           It's gotta be Mags.

                         

                          PETER
           I call not it.

                          BILLY
           Art. Billy. The good news is Ricardo
           Rincon's heading over to the clubhouse.
           The bad news is you got to tell Mags he
           threw his last pitch for the Oakland A's
           last night.

           ART V/O
           No.

                         

                          BILLY
           What do you mean, no.

           ART V/O
           No, as in no. I'm not doing it. You do
           it. You did it, so you do it.
           Art hangs up. Billy slams the speakerphone.

                         

                          PETER
           It's not the phone's fault. Suzanne,
           we're gonna need a new speakerphone.

                         

                          BILLY
           We gotta catch Mags before Rincon comes
           over.

                         
           He leaves.

           Billy comes through the clubhouse past his team suiting
           up to where Magnante is adjusting his knee braces next to
           his locker, and sits with him.

                          BILLY

                          MIKE --

                          MAGNANTE
           Hey, Billy. I know I've been struggling
           lately. But we're coming into the home
           stretch, and I promise I'm gonna turn it

                          AROUND --

                         

                          BILLY
           -- I need you to stop getting dressed.
           Magnante isn't sure he heard right, but the silence tells
           him he did. Eventually -

                         

                          MAGNANTE
           Traded?

          Billy shakes his head, no.

                         

                          BILLY
           I'm sorry for the crap news. I know it
           hurts.

                          (THEN)
           Mike. I can't have 26 guys in the
           clubhouse.
          Magnante nods.

                         

                          MAGNANTE
           Alright.

                         

                          BILLY
           Thanks.
          Billy gets up to leave. As he exits, he sees Peter enter
          with Rincon, standing with his new uniform in his arms,
          looking like a prison inmate. Oops. Billy joins them.

           Hola, senor.

                          BILLY
           Hola. Hey, I know this must seem a bit
           sudden, but the Oakland A's have been
           trying to get you for a long time.
           You're gonna love it here. The guys are
           fun.

                          PETER
           Muy divertido.

                          RINCON
           I pitch tonight?

                         

                          BILLY
           I don't know if you're gonna pitch
           tonight. But you're on our team tonight.

                          RINCON
           I no wanna pitch tonight.

                         

                          BILLY
           Right. So... where you from?

           don't you hang out there for five menudos
           and we'll get you a uniform and
           everything.

           Tara and I were thinking about going to
           Point Reyes to the beach.

                          CASEY
           That'd be fun.

           Me go, too?

           And I'll work on my grammar.

           Dad... are you going to lose your job?

                         

                          BILLY
           What? Where did you hear that, honey?

           The internet.

                          BILLY
           No, I'm not going to lose my job. Don't
           go on the internet or watch TV or read
           the papers or talk to people.

                          CASEY
          I'm not talking to people, I'm just
          reading stuff.

                         

                          BILLY
          Don't worry. You don't believe me? Ask
          Tara.

                         

                          TARA
          He's not (losing his job). Your dad is a
          brilliant man. He's the best GM in
          baseball.

                         

                          CASEY
          But say that you did -- just saying --
          would you have to move away?

                         

                          BILLY
          No, honey. Absolutely not. And even if
          I did, I'm not going anywhere. I told
          you not to worry about me. People say a
          lot of crazy things and they don't always
          know what they're talking about. It's
          just gossip. Like gossipers at school.

                         

                          TARA
          You can't always believe what you read.
          Sometimes you need to scratch underneath
          the surface and find who the authority
          is.

                          BILLY
          And once you do find out who the
          authorities are, ignore them at all
          costs.

                          TARA
          You can always ask your dad.

                         

                          BILLY
          Everything's fine, honey. I'm not going
          anywhere. The only way I would lose my
          job is if someone was to give me a better
          one. Don't worry about me, okay? Dad
          knows what he's doing.

                          CASEY

           This is a chart of what you should and
           shouldn't be swinging at. These circles
           represent different pitches. Red is hit,
           blue is out, yellow's missed or foul,
           green is chased, white taken. This is
           you versus Conway. What do you see?

                         

                          HATTEBERG
           I'm chasing a lot of high and outside.

                         

                          PETER
           The red is where most hits happen.
           That's where you want to be swinging.
           You don't want to be swinging at the junk
           at the top of the strike zone. We'd
           rather take those strikes, `cause you're
           not going to hit `em out of the park.
           And you're good about that, patient.

           Right now you're averaging about 4
           pitches per at-bat.

                         

                          HATTEBERG
           4 per bat?

                          PETER
           Yeah, and that's great. One of the
           reasons why we love you. You're draining
           a pitcher's pitches. Now, guys like
           Bonds and Jason Giambi average a little
           over 5. That's top tier. Does this
           chart make sense to you?

                         

                          HATTEBERG
           Yeah. I'll get on base more if I lay off
           anything high. This is awesome. So you
           have a breakdown of this from every game?

                          PETER
           Every game. Your instincts are in the
           right place. This isn't something they
           teach you in little league. This is
           something fundamental we're looking for --
           how to wear out a pitcher's arm. If
           you're about to face Conway and wondering
           what you should and shouldn't swing at,
           come in here and watch how you're
           tending. You can click on any one of
           these pitches and watch it happen.
           Pretty great, right?

           Everybody thinks the first pitch is
           what's most important, but it's not.
           It's the first two out of three pitches
           that matter the most.

           in the driver's seat?

                          PETER
           Any sort of extra discipline in the first
           three pitches will help us.

                         
           A game is on TV in the background. Billy makes various
           comments the the screen --

                          BILLY
           That's a problem right there. Terrance
           jogging to first.

                          (THEN)
           Mr. Justice. That's what we pay you for.

                          (THEN)
           Chad Bradford, you deceptive son of a

           Another train of thought --

                          PETER
           Hatteberg once had 18 walks in 30 at
           bats.

                         

                          BILLY
           My whole career I only had eighteen
           walks.

                         

                          PETER
           Actually... 11.

                          BILLY

                          BILLY
           Migs, let's make a deal. I'll pay you
           fifty bucks for every away fastball you
           hit to opposite field, but you've gotta
           pay me fifty for every one of those you

                          BILLY
           Hey, T. Did your car get egged?

                         

                          LONG
           Yeah.

                          BILLY
           I think I just got an e-mail from the
           culprit. He said he was tired of paying
           good money just to watch you jogging
           around the bases.

                         

                          LONG
           What the hell does that have to do with
           anything?

                          BILLY
           I don't know, man. Don't worry about it.

                         
           Billy exits. Long calls after --

           Billy and Mecir walk down the hall with the smelly stain.

                         

                          BILLY
           Man, you're not fooling anyone but
           yourself out there. You're falling
           further and further behind. In your
           mind, what's the problem?
           Mecir mumbles something.

                         

                          BILLY
           I can't understand you with your hand
           over your mouth.

                         

                          MECIR
           Sorry, Billy. It's just, the smell...

                          BILLY
           Right?

                          (INDICATES STAIN)
           It's that. And it's growing.

                         
           They stare at the stain in silence. Finally --

                          MECIR
           I'm gonna grab a shower.

           Hatteberg in the clubhouse. Billy enters.

                         

                          BILLY
           Hey, Scottie. What's on your mind?

                         

                          HATTEBERG
           I feel like I'm hurting the team. At
           first base I'm making a lot of errors.
           I'm gonna cost us a hundred runs.

                          BILLY
           16.5 actually. But as a hitter, you will
           create 70 runs. 70 runs wins us an awful
           lot of ball games. I can live with that.
           Can you live with that?

                         

                          HATTEBERG
           I appreciate that, but I know you're just
           pulling those numbers out of your ass.

                          BILLY
           I'm pulling them out of Pete's, actually.

                          (THEN)
           And another thing. When a guy reaches
           first base, be social.

                         

                          HATTEBERG
           Social?

                         

                          BILLY
           Like a greeter at the Gap. A guy steps
           into your office, chat him up. You're
           well read, you went to college. Have
           some fun out there. Relax.

                          HATTEBERG
           Yes sir.

           It's the Twins vs. the A's. A TWINS PLAYER stands at
           first, stoic. Scott figures "What the hell?" and turns
           to him.

                          HATTEBERG
           What are you guys getting up to tonight?

           I don't buy it.

                          TWINS PLAYER #1
           I'm sore, man. Beat up. Day in, day

           You ever get up to Boundary Waters up
           there in Minnesota? It's beautiful. I
           went on a trip up there. Fishing trip.
           Caught some walleye.

                         

                          TWINS PLAYER #1
           That's good fishing.

           Crack! The ball's in play. It's thrown to Hatteberg,

                          HATTEBERG
           I don't know. Depends on if we beat you
           today. Probably celebrating.

                          (THEN)

           Let's go!

                         

                          LEGEND:

                         
           September 4, 2002
           Kansas City Royals at Oakland A's

                          GAME 20

                         

           REPORTER #2 V/O
           --one game shy of 20 consecutive wins,
           they have a shot at redemption. How rare
           is it to win 20 games in a row? This
           rare: No American League team has ever
           done it.

           141.

          140 INT. BILLY'S TRUCK - MOVING - DAY 140


                         
           BILLY heads east on 580. His cell phone rings and he hits
           the speaker button for the truck.

                         

                          BILLY
           Don't tell me the score, Peter.

           SHARON V/O
           It's me, Billy.

                          BILLY
           How you doin', leggy.

                         

           SHARON V/O
           Nope.

                         

                          BILLY
           Sharon?

                         

           SHARON V/O
           You hangin' in there?

                         

                          BILLY
           Yeah.

                         
           There's silence...

                         

                          BILLY
           Hello?

                          (BEAT)
           Sharon?

           SHARON V/O

                          (PAUSE)
           "Go into real estate". What a stupid
           thing to say.
           BILLY didn't even realize until that moment how much he
           wanted to hear her say that...He's not sure what to say
           back.

                         

                          BILLY
           I appreciate that, thanks.

                         

           SHARON V/O
           Good luck. Casey wants to talk to you.

                         

           CASEY V/O
           Are you on your way to the stadium?

                         

                          BILLY
           No, I'm on my way to Visalia to see our
           minor league team.

           142.

           142.

                         

                         

                          CASEY
           Dad - turn around. You have to see the
           game.

                         

                          BILLY
           No, I don't.

                          CASEY
           Turn around.

                          BILLY
           I'll talk to you later, sweetheart. I
           love you.

                         
           He hangs up, drives a little longer...letting what Casey
           said sink in. Then...

                          BILLY

                          (TO HIMSELF)
           Shhhit.

                         
           ...he turns on the radio.

           ANNOUNCER V/O
           Tim Hudson is carving through this Royals
           line-up and at the end of three, it's the
           A's 11 and Kansas City nothing.

                          BILLY

                          (QUIETLY)
           Oh God.

                          (BEAT)
           Ohhhh God.

                         
           BILLY sees the sign for the next exit coming up. He makes
           a decision and quickly crosses to the right, just making
           the exit.

                          CUT TO:

          141 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - LATER - DAY 141


                         
           BILLY is striding through an underground corridor which
           is echoing with the cheers of 55,000 fans.

                         

          142 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD LEVEL - DAY 142

           BILLY emerges from a tunnel to a sight Billy's denied
           himself for 138 games: The lit-up ballpark with a game in
           play. From the field, we see Billy finding his place in
           the seats behind home plate. Peter is already there.

           143.

           143.

                         

                         
           BILLY'S POV OF THE SCOREBOARD: 11-0 at the bottom of the
           3rd. Unfortunately the idyllic moment is short-lived as
           Dye strikes out swinging and the teams swap places. The
           A's take the field with TIM HUDSON pitching.
           Billy looks around. He sees the scoreboard, a FAN with a
           big funky cowboy hat, the charged-up crowd in the stands,
           it's like the Coliseum at Rome.

           IBANEZ of the Royals singles to center field.

                         
           RANDA of the Royals singles to left field.
           But the Oakland fans are still jubilant and do the wave.

                         
           Then a big error from Tejada puts runners on 1st, 2nd and
           3rd (MAYNE, Ibanez and Randa).

          A143A EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - MAGIC HOUR - TOP OF 4TH A143A


                         
           As if we've entered the Twilight Zone, it becomes
           twilight and LIGHTS GO ON.

                         
           DEE BROWN of the Royals singles to right, bringing Ibanez
           and Randa home, and Mayne to 3rd.

                         
           Ibanez and Randa high-five each other at the plate,
           passing Billy as they head to their dugout. Okay, the
           Royals are on the board now: 11-2, but just barely. Until-

                         

          A143B EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - NIGHT - TOP OF THE 4TH A143B

           PEREZ of the Royals singles to center field, bringing
           Mayne home.
           Then TUCKER of the Royals doubles to left field. Justice
           makes an embarrassing fall trying to catch it, and Brown
           and Perez score. They high-five and pass Billy as they
           leave the plate, the second time he's seen that, and
           suddenly the Royals have 5.
           Reaction shot CLOSE-UPS: Justice, Tejada, Tucker on 2nd,
           Art Howe, the Royals' dugout, a pitcher's conference with
           Peterson and Hudson.

                         
           And finally Billy, who WALKS OUT.

           MIKE SWEENEY of the Royals singles to left-center field --
           Neither Justice or Long get it, it lands between them.
           And they have WORDS.

           144.

           144.

                         

                         
           Randa makes a sloppy single to left field... this one
           goes between Justice and Tejada.

           MONTAGE of A's at bat: Hernandez grounds out, DURHAM
           strikes out, Mabry grounds out... A stunned A'S FAN
           stands up with his arms out in a "WTF??" gesture. While
           the A's are still up, this is excruciating for the fans.

           ANNOUNCER V/O
           Kansas City's scored five and Oakland's
           lead is down to six as Art Howe comes out
           to the mound to pull Tim Hudson.

                         
           Art Howe comes out of the dugout, gives the signal for
           "underhander," takes the ball from Hudson.

           ANNOUNCER V/O
           He'll go with the submariner, Chad
           Bradford.

                         
           We see SHOTS OF FANS in the sold-out stadium experiencing
           the height of tension and excitement in sports.

                         
           Chad Bradford comes off the bullpen mound to relieve
           Hudson, and begins counting his steps -

                         

                          CHAD
           One, two, three, four -

           Chad arriving at the mound taking the game ball from Art,
           who we see is genuinely supportive and encouraging to
           Chad.

                          CHAD
           I know what it is to be in need and to
           have plenty. I am content. I can do all
           things through Christ who gives me

           BILLY is just as tense as the fans.

           (to himself but to

                          CHAD)
           Okay Chad, let's see it.

           CHAD walks Mayne. An angry fan throws toilet paper onto
           center field, the one thing Long manages to pick up. The
           crowd grows anxious.
           CHAD's submariner pitch to the next batter, DEE BROWN,
           walks him. BROWN trots down to first and there are now
           two runners on.
           Some FANS have to cover their eyes. There's a pitcher
           conference.

                         
           Art Howe simmers in frustration. He signals Rincon to
           warm up. The fans aren't happy either.

                         
           ORDAZ of the Royals grounds to Tejada, who throws home
           for the force, and misses. Now it's 11-6!

                         
           Howe pulls Bradford.
           Rincon throws a controversial strike out. The Royals
           batter, TUCKER, protests, and fans go crazy BOOING.

                         
           Brown scores, 11-7 now, Royals chipping away that lead,

                          AND --

                         
           Howe pulls Rincon. Tam comes in to relieve him.
           Sweeney's up. In rapid succession, we seem him battle off
           TEN PITCHES of Tam. He's got two strikes on him, more
           toilet paper flies on the field, Bowie comes in to warm
           up which Tam sees, then -

                         
           SWEENEY HITS A THREE-RUN HOMER TO MAKE IT 11-10! This is
           excruciating.

           BOWIE is already gone. KOCH is on the mound. There's a
           Royal, PELLOW, on 2nd. According to the scoreboard, it's
           2 outs, 2 strikes. If Koch throws a strike, the game is
           over. The fans are fucking feverish.
           ALICEA of the Royals singles to left and Pellow scores.
           The game is now TIED.

                         
           In their dugout, Royals GLOAT.

           He's ended the inning, but in the A's dugout, Koch slams
           the wall.

           The scoreboard shows us that it's still tied in the
           bottom of the ninth. Nobody's out. DYE grabs a bat and
           walks to the plate. Then, inexplicably, Howe turns to-

                          ART
           Hattie. Grab a bat.

                         
           SCOTT HATTEBERG actually points to himself and mouths,
           Me?

                         

                          ART
           Let's go.

                         
           SCOTT pulls a bat from the rack and heads to the on-deck
           circle. He only manages a warmup pitch or two before -

           Billy is watching on a muted television as he sees Dye
           fly out to right field. As Hatte approaches the plate, he
           kills the TV.

           VOICE OF GOD
           Pinch hitting for Eric Byrnes--Scott
           Hatteberg.

                         
           Scott's wife, ELIZABETH, watches from the VIP seats. She
           clutches her face.
           SCOTT lets the first pitch go by.

                         

                          UMPIRE
           Ball!

                         
           Art Howe looks like he can't stand it any longer. In the
           dugout, Koch looks like a psychopath ready to kill.
           SCOTT steps out of the box to catch his breath. He steps
           back in and stares at the exact spot in space he thinks
           the pitch will leave the pitcher's hand.

                         
           The pitch. SCOTT swings.

           Crack! 55,000 erupt. The A's leap to the front of the
           dugout steps and watch.

                         
           We see the ball ascending on a strong trajectory, but
           before we can know for sure where it's headed, TIME SLOWS

           BILLY's sitting on the floor with his back against the
           wall, trying to breathe. He looks like he's in pain. He
           can't move.
           He hears the crowd ERUPT outside. His Blackberry buzzes:

                         
           "hatte homered. a's 12, ryls 11"

                         
           Billy flips on the TV. With sound off, he watches silent
           images of his team swarming the mound in (archival
           footage) mixed in with Art Howe celebrating with them.

           The place is going crazy. ELIZABETH is screaming as she
           watches her husband get mauled by his teammates at the
           plate.

                         

          159 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 159

           BILLY's still contemplating making AL history as
           celebrating players flood into the locker room just
           outside. Billy looks through a portal on the door. He's
           trapped in here now. He crosses into the

                         

          160 INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS 160


                         
           The place is packed with players, coaches and news crews.
           There's no champagne spraying but they feel like they won
           the World Series and in fact have done something much
           more rare.
           Billy is trying to make a fast unnoticed exit. After
           pushing through the crowd, he walks outside of the club
           house into the -

           where the players' families and wives are waiting. Billy
           sees ELIZABETH HATTEBERG walking toward him--

                          ELIZABETH
           Mr. Beane? I'm Elizabeth Hatteberg. We
           met at my house last Christmas.

                         

                          BILLY
           Sure.

                         

                          ELIZABETH
           Thank you.

                         

                          BILLY
           Thank me? Thank you. Whatever you put in
           those Christmas cookies, keep--
          ELIZABETH starts to cry--

                         

                          BILLY
           Whoa. It's okay.

                         

                          ELIZABETH
           I'm sorry.

                         

                          BILLY
           It's alright.

                          ELIZABETH
           You don't know what it's like to have
           everyone think you're a failure.

                         
          BILLY doesn't say anything but of course he does.

                          BILLY
           Well...You never thought that, and that's

                          WHAT'S--

           (the worst possible

                          SIN)
           I did.

                          (BEAT)
           And he knows I did.

                         
          BILLY takes this in a second...

                         

                          BILLY
           Yeah he does know you did.

                          ELIZABETH
           He's talked to you?

                          BILLY
           No. I just know.

                          (BEAT)

           Your husband just took a Jason Grimsley
           two-seam fastball and parked it in the
           upper deck in left field for a pinch-hit
           walk-off home run in a record breaking
           game. Go tell him about it.
           ELIZABETH looks at him a moment...and then starts crying

                          AGAIN--

                          BILLY
           No it's okay now, just go.

                         
           ELIZABETH goes off to find her husband. BILLY sees PETER
           standing there.

           Aw, man. I spend the season trying to
           reduce it to numbers and we won on
           romance. Suddenly it's the Natural with
           Hatteberg. Scott Hatteberg.

           You should've seen Elizabeth's face when

                          BILLY
           She showed up afterwards.

                         

                          TARA
           What did she say?

                         

                          BILLY
           I was a big moment for them. You know
           everyone wrote him off?

                         

                          TARA
           You didn't. You found him and you put
           that together.

           I know. It was beautiful. But you
           know... it's not gonna mean a thing.

                         
           He's upset. She knows it.

                          BILLY
           Here's the thing -- we changed the game.
           We got this year, maybe next, then
           they're gonna catch on. This is our
           moment. I want to go the distance. I
           wanna shove it up the Yankees' ass. Not
           just the Yankees, but... these guys
           deserve it.

                          TARA
           You deserve it. Honey, 20 games. It's a
           record.

                          BILLY
           That's right, it's just a record. It
           gets buried in some book. Come on, tell
           me who won 19? I don't even know. It's
           4th place at the Olympics. Any other
           team wins the World Series this year...
           great. We're still in the record books.
           But if we win, we've changed the game.
           We've put it on its head and shoved it up
           their ass. If we don't, they're gonna
           erase us.

           The same shot as at the beginning: the Coliseum from high
           above, only this time the final game of the division
           series is being played at home.

           Minnesota Twins at Oakland A's
           The camera pans down the huge scoreboard. It's
           excruciating. The numbers on the board tell us it's been
           an incredibly close game but the A's are losing by one
           run in the bottom of the ninth with two outs and nobody
           on.

           151.

           Ray Durham stands in at the plate. Strike one to the
           Durham as we hear the venerable voice of ESPN's Joe
           Morgan, who's speaking post-game.

                         

           JOE MORGAN V/O
           The flaw in the A's thinking, and this
           comes from the top of their organization--
           is their failure to comprehend you have
           to manufacture runs in the post season.

                         
           Durham fouls off a pitch. Strike two.

                         

           JOE MORGAN V/O
           You have to steal. You have to bunt. You
           have to sacrifice. You have to trust in
           small ball, not Billy Ball.

                         
           Durham swings at the fastball and connects, but it's a
           pop fly to second which a TWINS INFIELDER easily nabs.
           The PITCHER throws his glove in the air and the CATCHER
           runs out to the mound as the rest of the Twins run to the
           middle of the field to begin their victory celebration.

                         
           Durham turns away and heads back to the dugout.
           The A's have lost the series.

                         

           JOE MORGAN V/O
           They think they've devised a science to
           win games. They think it resides in a
           computer. They thumb their nose at
           fundamentals. At tradition. At Baseball.

           still in uniform, hours after the game has ended, sitting
           with his face in his hands. After a long, deep breath he
           sits up and we discover that it's Billy, 10 years prior.

           of this? You're under contract, Billy.
           You extended.

                         

                          BILLY
           I know that, Steve, but I'd like to talk
           to them. I want to see what they have to
           say.

                         

           SCHOTT (V.O.)
           You're asking me to let them talk to you?

                         

                          BILLY
           Yes. With your permission.

           154.

           154.

                         

                         

           SCHOTT (V.O.)
           Well, I can't do that unless I know Peter
           is in place as my GM.

                         

                          BILLY
           Pete?

                         

           SCHOTT (V.O.)
           I'm not letting you take him with you,
           and I have no idea if he's willing to
           stay if you aren't here. How do I even
           know I can come to terms with him, given
           the extremely disadvantaged bargaining
           position you're putting me in?

                          BILLY
           Well, I think you'll agree this is a
           great opportunity for him. I can't
           believe he's not going to make a deal.
          Peter is frozen. Neither Steve nor Billy are acting like
          he's even in the room.

                         

           SCHOTT (V.O.)
           If you want out of your contract, I want
           their whole team and a lot of cash.
           We've invested in you.

                         

                          BILLY
           I haven't asked to get out of my
           contract, Steve, I just asked if I could
           talk to them.

                         

           SCHOTT (V.O.)
           And I said I won't give you permission
           unless I know I have Peter! You can't
           leave me with a vacant front office.

                         

                          BILLY
           Then talk to Peter.

           SCHOTT (V.O.)
           I will.
          Silence.

                         

           SCHOTT (V.O.)
           All right. You know what? I've made it
           a point never to stand in the way of a
           man wanting to make more money. They
           made the call, the genie's out of the
           bottle. I had faith in your judgement
           when I named you GM; that's why I did it
           and I have faith in it now. Good luck,
           Billy.

           155.

           155.

                         

                         
           Billy hangs up. A long beat. Peter looks at Billy.

                         

                          PETER
           Well, I didn't see that coming.

                          BILLY
           I think you should think about staying.
           You're one of the architects of this
           thing, it belongs as much to you as it
           does to me.

                         

                          PETER
           Okay... okay...

                         

                          BILLY
           How you doing Pete?

                         

                          PETER
           I'm a little overwhelmed right now. I
           think I need to process what's happening.

                         

                          BILLY
           Why don't you take the day off.

           Billy regards culinary treats presented fancifully in a
           towncar that transports him to Fenway Park.

                         

          170 EXT. FENWAY PARK - BOSTON - DAY 170


                         
           We establish the famous home of the Red Sox before
           finding BILLY standing on home plate. He looks around at
           the historic stadium...

           JOHN (O.S.)
           Billy Beane!

                         
           JOHN HENRY, the new owner of the Boston Red Sox, is
           shouting at him from the owner's box. BILLY gives a kind
           of wave.

                         

                          HENRY
           Due respect to the Coliseum, but this is
           a ball park.

                         

                          BILLY
           Yes it is. It is.

                         

                          HENRY

                          (SHOUTING)
           You ever play here?

           156.

          BILLY swinging hard at a pitch in the dirt.

                         

           CUT BACK TO:

                         

                          BILLY
           No.

                          JOHN
           That's a shame. Let's walk the field.

                         
          BILLY and JOHN begin a stroll around the perimeter of
          Fenway.

                          JOHN
           Hey, I'm sorry I kept you waiting but
           believe it or not there was snow on 84.
           The second week in October. The car
           turns on to Yawkee Way and it's 53
           degrees and this. How can there be an
           entirely different weather system here
           than there is three miles from here? Is
           that global warming or a sign that
           there's no such thing?

                         

                          BILLY
           I don't know.

                         

                          JOHN
           What's that Billy Joel song? Oh the snow
           it was falling from Stockbridge to
           Boston. And the hilltops seemed
           something because of that frosting.

                         

                          BILLY
           I think that's James Taylor and I'm
           certain those aren't the words.

                         

                          JOHN
           Well whatever, it was snowing from
           Stockbridge to Boston so I'm sorry I'm
           late. We'll have lunch in a little bit
           but why don't I have some coffee sent up.
           (he's already got his
           cell phone open)
           Denise?
           (back to BILLY)
           We've got espresso, cappuccino, latte,
           we've got a machine that makes whatever
           you want.

                          BILLY
           We've got free soda.

                          JOHN
           I heard about that.

                          (INTO PHONE)
           Can you have some coffee in there for us?

                          (BEAT)
           Thank you.

                         
           He snaps the phone shut.

          A171 INT. PRESS BOX - DAY A171


                         
           Billy and John admire the view. DENISE sets down a tray
           of coffee and exits.

                          JOHN
           It's her birthday and I need to get her a
           present but she's usually the one who
           does that for me so do you have any
           ideas?

                          BILLY

                          (PAUSE)
           A scarf?

                          JOHN
           You mean like wool?

                         

                          BILLY
           No I meant something that women wear
           with, you know, a decorative --

                          JOHN
           Sure! Excellent.

                          (PAUSE)
           And where would I get something like
           that?

                         

                          BILLY
           John, no disrespect, I just lost in five
           for the second year in a row -- give her
           a bowling ball for all I care.

                          JOHN
           Steve Schott told me he's offering you a
           new contract.

                          BILLY
           Yes he is.

                         

                          JOHN
           So why'd you return my call?

                         

                          BILLY
           You're the Red Sox, and I think I can
           help you.

                          BILLY (CONT'D)
           I think I can do something about the
           Curse of the Bambino. I heard you hired
           Bill James.

                         

                          HENRY
           Why it took someone so long to hire that
           guy is beyond me.

                         

                          BILLY
           Because baseball hates him.

                         

                          HENRY
           Money buys a lot of things. One is the
           luxury to disregard what baseball thinks.

                          BILLY
           That must be nice.
           (beat, then)
           I was grateful to get your call.

                         
          JOHN looks at BILLY a moment...

                         

                          JOHN
           You were grateful.

                         

                          BILLY
           Yeah.

                         

                          JOHN
           For 41 million you built a playoff team.
           You lost Damon, Giambi, Isringhausen and
           Pena and you won two more games without
           them than you did with them.
          And we begin a slow push-in on BILLY... this is the first
          person in baseball other than his assistant who doesn't
          think he's crazy.

                          JOHN
           You won the exact same number of games as
           the Yankees but the Yankees paid 1.4
           million dollars per win and you paid two-
           hundred and sixty thousand. Yes, I want
           you to be my General Manager.

                          (PAUSE)
           I know you're taking it in the teeth.
           The first guy through a wall always gets
           hurt. But those are dying voices. Any
           GM that doesn't tear down their team and
           rebuild it using your model is gonna be a
           dinosaur.

                         
          JOHN's taken a piece of paper out of his pocket and
          slides it to BILLY --

                          BILLY
           What's this?

                         

                          JOHN
           My first offer.
           BILLY opens it, looks at it for less than a second, and
           looks back up at JOHN...

          171 INT. LIMO - DAY 171


                         
           Billy looks out at the Boston scenery. He steals a
           glance at the paper in his hand, John's offer, pensive...

           Billy sits at a table. A baseball SLAMS down in front of
           him. He looks up to see where it came from. PETER is
           standing in the doorway.

                          PETER
           Heads up!

           Jesus. What the hell --

                          PETER
           Sorry.

                         

                          BILLY
           What the hell was that?

                          PETER
           I don't know. Sorry.

                          (THEN)
           How was Boston?

                         

                          BILLY
           Impressive.

                         

                          PETER
           You're giving me Youkilis, Billy.

                          BILLY
           Why would I ever do that?

                         

                          PETER
           Come on Billy, Schott's going to want
           something in exchange for letting you out
           of your contract and I want Youkilis.

                         

                          BILLY
           Oh, what is that, your GM voice? You
           can't have him.

                         

                          PETER
           And Cash. And a player to be named
           later.

                          BILLY
           You already have my job. What else do you
           want from me?

                         

                          PETER
           I don't want your job.

                         

                          BILLY
           Why did you take it?

                          PETER
           You didn't leave me much choice.

                          (THEN)
           Did Henry make you a good offer?

                          BILLY
           It doesn't matter.

                         

                          PETER
           Did he make you a good offer?

                         

                          BILLY
           It was fine.

                          PETER
           What was it?

                         

                          BILLY
           It doesn't matter.

                         
          Pete just stares at him. Finally, Billy reaches into his
          pocket, takes out the folded piece of paper and hands it
          to Peter.
          Peter looks at it...

                         

                          PETER
           He offered to make you the highest paid
           GM in pro sports.

                          BILLY

                          (GENUINELY

                          CONFLICTED)
          Do I love the Red Sox?

                          PETER
          I don't know. I've never heard you say
          you did.

                          BILLY
          So why am I doing this?

                         

                          PETER
          You're not doing it for the money.

                          BILLY
          I'm not?

                          PETER
          You're doing it for what the money says.
          It says what it says to any player who
          gets big money: that they're worth it.

                         

                          BILLY
          The offer says that. The money itself is
          redundant.

                          (BEAT)
          I made one personal decision based on
          money in my life and I swore to never do
          that again.

                          PETER
          So you're not going to Boston?

                         

                          BILLY
          I haven't decided.

                         

                          PETER
          It's all over the news that it's a done
          deal.

                          BILLY
          Look at this place. What a dump.

                          (THEN)
          I so wanted to win here.

                          PETER
          I think you've already won, Billy.

                          BILLY
          No Pete, we lost.

                         

                          PETER
          You haven't given yourself time to get
          over it, it's only been three days.

           162.

           162.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           I'm not even over last year yet. I don't
           get over it.

                         

                          PETER

                          (BEAT)
           I've got something in the video room,
           come with me.

                          BILLY
           I really can't look at video right now.

                         

                          PETER
           No, come with me.

          B177 INT. VIDEO ROOM - DAY B177


                          PAUL
           It's not much more than a home movie but
           you'll get the idea.

                          BILLY
           Who is it?

                         

                          PAUL
           The Visalia Oaks and their 240 pound
           catcher, Jeremy Brown, who's scared of
           running to second. This was in a game
           six weeks ago.

                         
           PAUL hits the remote and the tape starts. The quality is
           poor and the camera is focused only on Jeremy.

                         

                          PAUL
           This guy's gonna start him off with a
           fastball low and in because he hasn't
           read the book on our guy and doesn't know
           that low and in is where he eats. Jeremy
           takes him to deep center --
           We see JEREMY BROWN connect and the ball fly off the bat
           but the camera stays on JEREMY running to first. PAUL
           slows down the picture with the remote

                         

                          PAUL
           -- and he knows that if he runs it's a
           stand-up double and he's running.

                          BILLY

                          (QUIETLY)
           Go pal.

           163.

           163.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           And now he's gonna do something he never
           does. He's gonna round first base, he's
           gonna take the turn.

                          BILLY
           Please tell me he's safe at second.

                         

                          PAUL
           No. Because right here --

                         
          JEREMY slips and stumbles to the ground.

                         

                          PAUL
           -- is what he's always been afraid of.
           It's all he can do to get himself back to
           first.
          JEREMY has been scrambling in the dirt to get safely back
          to first base.

                         

                          BILLY
           What is that?

                         

                          PAUL
           That's the first base coach.

                         

                          BILLY
           Why's he laughing? I'm gonna fire that
           guy, why the hell is he --

                         

                          PAUL
           Everybody's laughing.

                         
          JEREMY's looking around the field now, looking at his own
          dugout. We can't see what he sees but he's confused.

                          PAUL
           And now Jeremy finds out why. Watch his
           face because this is art. He's just
           found out the ball went 60 feet over the
           fence. He'd hit a home run but he didn't
           know it.

                         
          And JEREMY's face explodes into a smile. He slaps hands
          with the first base coach and begins his trot around the
          bases.
          BILLY stares at this. He takes the remote and backs it
          up a little so he can see Jeremy's face again.

                         

                          BILLY
           How can anybody not be romantic about
           baseball?

                          PAUL

                          (PAUSE)
           It was a metaph--

                         

                          BILLY
           I know it was a metaphor.

                         

                          PAUL
           That was a hell of a baseball season,
           boss.

                         

                          BILLY
           The Island of Misfit Toys. Okay.

                         
           And with that, Billy's mind begins to go elsewhere. No
           resolution, no decision, other than to get up and wander
           on.

           DRONE of talk radio criticism.

           BILLY keeps listening a moment, then reaches in the glove
           box and pulls out a CD marked "Dad's Mix".

                         
           BILLY slips it in the CD player. The sound of the radio
           immediately snaps off and the momentary silence is soon

           Hey, Dad. I picked these songs out just

           Legend: Boston never traded to Billy - or anyone else -
           their Greek God of Walks, Kevin Youkilis. He was part of
