FOLDS OF BLUE VELVET UNDULATE EVER SO SLOWLY.

WITH TITLES

                              DISSOLVE TO:

1. EXT. BEAUMONTS' FRONT LAWN - DAY

Blue skies. PAN SLOWLY DOWN to clean white picket fence, with beautiful
red roses in front of it. Birds CHIRP in the distance. A faint sprinkler
SOUND is heard. Very sweet MUSIC is playing.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

2. EXT. TREE - DAY

A songbird SINGS in the tree.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

3. EXT. CROSSWALK - SHADY STREET - DAY

A very clean uniformed, smiling POLICEMAN with arms outstretched allows
clean happy SCHOOL CHILDREN to cross the street safely.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

4. EXT. SHADY STREET - DAY

A bright red gorgeous fire engine is moving very slowly down the street.

We MOVE IN to see the happy face of a FIREMAN.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

5. EXT. FLOWER GARDEN - DAY

Yellow tulips sway in a warm afternoon breeze.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

6. EXT. BEAUMONTS' FRONT LAWN - DAY

The same white picket fence with roses in front of it.

PANNING SLOWLY now away from the roses down to the rich green lawn
and over to the sprinkler which goes around and around shooting water
droplets sparkling in the light.

This is slightly SLOW MOTION and DREAMY.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

7. EXT. BEAUMONTS' FRONT LAWN - DAY

CLOSER ON WATER DROPLETS. The water droplets are somewhat abstracted
as they dance in the light.

PAN DOWN now to the green grass, traveling along the grass.

The MUSIC becomes fainter as we MOVE SUDDENLY under the grass, now as
if in a dark forest.

SLOWLY MOVING THROUGH.

The grass is like great timbers.

It is GETTING DARKER and ominous SOUNDS come up as we discover black
insects crawling and scratching in the darkness.

FADE TO:

8. EXT. BEAUMONT'S FRONT LAWN - DAY

MR. BEAUMONT is watering flowers and grass with the hose.

He is dressed in khaki trousers, canvas shoes, old white shirt, straw
hat and dark glasses.

CLOSE - MR. BEAUMONT

watches his watering, then looks up.

The sky and the neighborhood are reflected in his dark glasses.  He
moves his false teeth around a little in his mouth, jutting out his chin
in the process.  He's thinking about who knows what.

He looks back down at his lawn.

CLOSEUP - WATER ON GRASS

The water hits the grass and mats it down.

WIDER - MR. BEAUMONT

moves the hose over a bush and gets a kink in it.

Water stops coming out of the nozzle and there is a LOUD HISSING NOISE
of water under pressure.

CLOSEUP - KINK IN HOSE

Loud HISSING NOISE.

Mr. Beaumont goes around the bush and is undoing the kink when he is
suddenly hit with a tremendous seizure.

CLOSEUP - MR. BEAUMONT
He's doubling over and falls to the ground.  He continues to grasp onto
the hose.

Water shoots crazily onto the driveway and his car.

Mr. Beaumont seems to be in tremendous pain.

                              CUT TO:

Mrs. Beaumont is curled up on the couch, smoking a cigarette and watching

No sound is coming out.

WATER SOUND is loud.

WIDER - MR. BEAUMONT

Water is still spraying out over the driveway and onto the car and into
the yard beyond.

A small boy, GREGG, appears wearing only white underpants and a white
t-shirt.  He holds a large red popsicle.

Gregg waddles around looking at the crazy water show.  He holds his hand
out to get it wet in the spray.  This makes him screw up his face in a
laugh.

He waddles over and looks at Mr. Beaumont on the ground.

Mr. Beaumont seems to be worse now, unconscious, but still gripping the
hose tightly. His clothes are sopping wet.

11. EXT. GREGG'S HOUSE - DAY

Screen window of Gregg's house. Gregg's mother calls out but remains
looking at a bowl she is holding in her hands.

          GREGG'S MOTHER
          (calling out)
Gregg. Billy's waiting for his teddy.

She then turns to look out.

          GREGG'S MOTHER
          (continuing)
GREGG! Billy's waiting for his teddy, honey.

A COLLEGE BOY enters the auditorium, urgently looking for someone.  He
quickly approaches a GIRL.

          COLLEGE BOY
     Louise? Where's Jeffrey? His mother's on
     the phone - it's an emergency.

     while ago. I'm getting very tired of
     waiting - let's go find him.

15. INT. JANITOR'S QUARTERS - COLLEGE - NIGHT

We MOVE INTO the face of JEFFREY. He is hiding behind a furnace.  He is
fascinated by a sight beyond in the darkness of this basement room.

He sees a male student trying to rape his girlfriend.  She is crying and
telling him to stop but the boy keeps forcing her down toward the ground.
forcing her clothes off her.  Jeffrey at this point hears his name being
called.  Each time he hears his name the caller is closer.  The boy is now
hurting the girl.  Before Jeffrey leaves the furnace room he yells out:

          JEFFREY
     Hey, shit head. Leave her alone. Don't
     force girls!

The couple looks up but cannot see Jeffrey.  The boy is scared and releases
the girl who promptly pulls farther away, crying.

Jeffrey leaves the furnace room.

26. EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

Jeffrey comes walking out of the airport, where his Mother and AUNT
BARBARA, who is a very absent-minded little woman with very thick glasses,
are waiting for him.

They are parked illegally and another car is honking at them.  Their
trunk is open in anticipation of Jeffrey's things.  They are waving and
yelling at Jeffrey to get his attention.  He finally joins them and kisses
his Mother, then his Aunt.

          JEFFREY
     Hi Mom. Hi Aunt Barbara.

They AD LIB hellos.

          MRS. BEAUMONT
          (a bit concerned)
     Where's all your things, Jeffrey?

          JEFFREY
     This is it.

Mrs. Beaumont looks at Jeffrey.

          JEFFREY
     I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is
     all I have.

          AUNT BARBARA
     You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice
     flight?

          JEFFREY
     Yeah. How's Dad?

          MRS. BEAUMONT
     He's alright. We'll tell you on the way home.

27. INT. BEAUMONT'S CAR - NIGHT

They get in the car.  Aunt Barbara is driving.  She is not a good driver
and makes Jeffrey nervous.  He watches her every move from the back seat.

They drive on surface streets.  Many gas stations, traffic lights, bars.

          MRS. BEAUMONT
     He had a cerebral hemorrhage and they think
     there's some sort of clot, or tumor, or
     something in there. They're doing all sorts
     of tests. On the surface, he looks pretty
     good, but there are problems. They think he
     may have to stay in two weeks now, at least.
     You can go see him though tomorrow, Jeffrey.

          AUNT BARBARA
     They tore down the A & P, Jeffrey. Did you
     see that?


          JEFFREY

Jeffrey, Aunt Barbara, and Mrs. Beaumont enter the living room.  Mrs.
Beaumont turns on a table lamp.  A cold circle of light hits the light
blue rug.

CLOSEUP - JEFFREY

A breeze of cold powerful string MUSIC blows as we watch Jeffrey stare into
space.

31. INT. BEAUMONTS' KITCHEN/HALLWAY - DAY

Mrs. Beaumont is calling upstairs to Jeffrey.

          MRS. BEAUMONT
     Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.

          JEFFREY (V.O.)
          (calling)
     Be right down.

Mrs. Beaumont joins Aunt Barbara at the breakfast table in the kitchen.

          AUNT BARBARA
     This is marvelous jam. Are you going this
     morning?

          MRS. BEAUMONT
     I think Jeffrey would like to see his father
     alone.


Jeffrey comes down the stairs.  Everyone says their "good mornings," and
Jeffrey sits down to breakfast.

          JEFFREY
     What time are visiting hours?

          MRS. BEAUMONT
     I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for
     10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk
     over; I need the car this morning.

          JEFFREY
     Well. Okay.

          MRS. BEAUMONT
     Jeffrey, when you see your father.

          JEFFREY
     Yeah?

          MRS. BEAUMONT
     He doesn't know you're out of school. He
     thinks it's a vacation for you.

          JEFFREY
     What?

          MRS. BEAUMONT
     It would be too much for him. So please
     let him think as he does, that you're
     home just to see him.

          JEFFREY
     Thanks a lot, Mom.

          MRS. BEAUMONT
     .Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave
school and go to work in the store. maybe
going back to school will be an option one
day. I hope so.

          AUNT BARBARA
     I think it's important not to get depressed.
     Depression is a terrible thing. They say it
     can bring on illness.

          JEFFREY
          (angry)
     Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.

                              CUT TO:

33. INT. HALLWAY - HOSPITAL - DAY

Jeffrey follows a nurse to a hospital room.

          NURSE CINDY
     Please wait outside while Dr. Gynde prepares
     him to see you.


          JEFFREY
     Prepares him?

She peers into the room.  Jeffrey does too.

34. INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

All he can see are curtains surrounding a bed and stacks of medical
machinery.  Doctor Gynde comes out from behind the curtains and walks to
Jeffrey.

          DR. GYNDE
     Hello Jeffrey.

          JEFFREY
     Hello, Doctor Gynde. How is he?

          DR. GYNDE
     He's fighting hard. Jeffrey. it's very
     important that your father doesn't try
     to move. he's been immobilized. It would
     be very painful for him. sit close. you do
     the talking and moving. He knows you're
     here. He became very emotional. I don't
     think he likes the idea of you seeing him
     like this.

Nurse Cindy goes to the bed.  She begins to pull the curtains back
revealing Mr. Beaumont.

          NURSE CINDY
          (smiling a big smile)
     Mr. Beaumont! Your son is here to visit you.

Then we see Mr. Beaumont.  He has numerous tubes and needles going into
different parts of him.  A stainless steel device holds his head perfectly
still.  Nurse Cindy picks up a tray and leaves.

          JEFFREY
     (shocked but concealing it)
     Hi Dad.

          MR. BEAUMONT
     (speaking as plainly as possible,
  but sounds like mumbling)
     Hey Jeff.

Jeffrey goes to him and puts out his hand to shake his father's hand but
remembers his father cannot move.  Jeffrey pats him on the shoulder.

          JEFFREY
     Looks like they've got you strapped in
     pretty good.

          MR. BEAUMONT
     (lips moving but hardly any sound)
     uh uh.

          JEFFREY
     Are you feeling okay?

          MR. BEAUMONT
          (more mumbling)
     uh uh.

Tears well up in Mr. Beaumont's eyes.  Before Jeffrey can stop him he
reaches for Jeffrey's hand, then struggling against tremendous pain he
manages to form words.

          MR. BEAUMONT
     (more plainly but under strain)
     Good to see you, son.

          JEFFREY
          (holding back tears)
     It's good to see you, Dad.

Jeffrey squeezes his father's hand.

35. EXT. VACANT FIELD - DAY

Jeffrey is walking down a dirt road on his way home.  He kicks up little
clouds of dust as he walks.  He has some time to think about things. He
sees a green bottle in the distance. He gathers up a few more rocks and
pitches them one by one at the bottle.  He misses.

He looks for a few more good rocks to throw and while looking through some
tall grass and weeds, he sees something strange.

He looks closer.  It is a HUMAN EAR, covered with crawling ants.

Jeffrey immediately stands up and looks around.  All he sees are houses
- some laundry drying - a very peaceful scene.  No one seems to be around -
No one seems to be watching him.

He looks again at the ear.

We are so close we can hear ants racing frantically around the ear into it.
There is dried blood on part of it.

Jeffrey finds a brown paper bad and using a twig, he pushes the ear onto
it.  Again, he stands up and looks around.

IN THE DISTANCE, a MAN goes into the back door of a house.  Nothing more.

Jeffery hurries off, carrying the bag with the ear in it.

                              CUT TO:

36. EXT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

Jeffrey goes up the front steps...

37. INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

... and to the Reception Desk.  A POLICE OFFICER is standing behind the
counter.

          JEFFREY
     Hello. could you tell me if Detective
     Williams is still working here?

          POLICE OFFICER
     He's up in Room 221. Right up the stairs.

                              CUT TO:

38.      INT. ROOM 221 - POLICE STATION - DAY

Jeffrey enters Room 221 and sees the desk marked, "DETECTIVE J.D.
WILLIAMS," however, the desk is empty.  TWO MEN are talking at the end
of the room; one of them comes toward Jeffrey.

          JEFFREY
     Are you Detective Williams?

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     Yes.

          JEFFREY
     My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near
     you. I believe you know my father, Tom
     Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     Sure I do. I understand he's in the
     hospital. How is he?

          JEFFREY
     He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're
     doing tests, that's why I'm home from
     school. I was over at the hospital this
     morning and I was going home and in the
     field behind our neighborhood. there
     behind Vista, I found an ear.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
          (matter of factly)
     You did? A human ear?

          JEFFREY
     Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I
     thought I should bring it to you.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.

Jeffrey opens the bag and lets Detective Williams look inside.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
          (continuing)
     That sure looks like a human ear, doesn't
     it?. Let's run it down to the Coroner's
     Office and see what they make of it. Then,
     I want you to show me exactly where you
     found it.

                              CUT TO:

39. INT. CORONER'S OFFICE - DAY

Jeffrey, Detective Williams, and an OLD CORONER'S OFFICER are looking at
the ear, which is sitting in a medical dish on a table.

          CORONER'S OFFICER
     The tests will take awhile. Meanwhile,
     we'll check the morgue records. I don't
     recall anything coming in minus an ear.

The Coroner's Officer turns to Jeffrey.

          CORONER'S OFFICER
          (continuing)
     Now if you'd found a jaw or let's say, a
     heart, or even an arm, we would assume
     that there was a corpse, however, a finger
     or an ear. the person may very well be
     alive somewhere.

          JEFFREY
     What can you tell about the person from the
     ear?

          CORONER'S OFFICER
     Well. when the tests are done, quite a lot
     . Sex, blood type, whether or not the ear
     came off a dead person. Right now, I know
     what you know. It's a real human ear. The
     human was, or is, Caucasian.
     . also. It looks like the ear was cut off
     with scissors.

40. EXT. VACANT FIELD - DAY

Jeffrey is out with Detective Williams and a CREW OF OFFICERS who have
roped off the area and are doing a grid search.

A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER is also there taking flash pictures all around the
field, especially where Jeffrey has told them he found the ear.

Detective Williams takes Jeffrey aside.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going
     to the press and I'm going to ask you to
     consider all you've heard strictly
     confidential. Do not discuss this business
     with anyone, but me, or other police
     personnel. Got it?

          JEFFREY
     Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much
     as you did.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.

                              CUT TO:

41. INT. BEAUMONTS' KITCHEN - NIGHT

Mrs. Beaumont and Aunt Barbara are doing the dishes. The news is on a
small portable television.  There is a broadcast on the mounting crime
wave.

INSERT T.V. SCREEN

A series of murders are being discussed and a police drawing mug shot is
shown on the screen of the suspect who is at large.

                              CUT TO:

42. INT. JEFFREY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jeffrey is sitting at his desk daydreaming.  He suddenly picks up the
phone, hesitates, then dials.

          JEFFREY
     Hello?. LOUISE WERTHAM please. Louise?
     . is she there?. Louise?
          (very happy)
     Yeah! How are you? He's okay. in the
     hospital for tests.
          (very serious)
     I miss you so much.
          (smiling now)
     What have you been up to?. Louise, I don't
     know. I've got to see how my father is
     . It costs a fortune in that hospital.
     When did he ask you to that?. Look. I
     can't stop you. Go ahead. Just go ahead
     . I may never be back, go. ahead. Look
     Louise, stop trying to explain everything.
     Just do it. let's talk again in a couple
     of days or somethin', okay?. Yeah, I still
     love you. Goodbye Louise. Goodbye.

Jeffrey sits alone in his room, thinking things over.

          SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

43. INT. CORONER'S OFFICE - NIGHT

CLOSE UP - EAR IN MORTICIAN'S DISH

VERY SLOWLY, we MOVE very close to the ear, gliding slowly around the
crevices approaching the dark hole.  A huge, low rushing of air SOUND,
THEN DARKNESS.

          SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

44. INT. BEAUMONTS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Low light.  Jeffrey enters the room.  Aunt Barbara and Mrs. Beaumont are
watching television.  Aunt Barbara is knitting.

          JEFFREY
     I'm going out for awhile.

          MRS. BEAUMONT
          (looks at her watch)
     Do you want the car?

          JEFFREY
     No, I'm just gonna walk around.

          MRS. BEAUMONT
     Alright.

          AUNT BARBARA
     Jeffrey. you're not going down by Lincoln,
     are you?

          JEFFREY
          (yelling back)
     No. I'm just going to walk around the
     neighborhood. Don't worry.

Aunt Barbara and Mrs. Beaumont continue watching the television.

INSERT T.V. SCREEN

On T.V. we see a man's shoes.  He is sneaking slowly up some stairs.

                              CUT TO:

45. EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

Jeffrey walks along the dark streets.  The same sombre MUSIC plays low
and slow.

Some of the houses have a few lights on, some are dark.  Some windows have
a slow uneven blue flashing light, indicating the television is on inside.

Jeffrey continues walking through the night.  In the trees, the shadows
continuously re-arrange themselves in mysterious, sometimes frightening
patterns.

46. EXT. WILLIAMS HOME - NIGHT

Jeffrey finally comes to the house he's been looking for.

He goes up the front walk.  Now, at the last minute, he feels a little
foolish and has second thoughts about knocking on the door.

He looks in a window.  Inside, he sees a nicely-lit living room.
He goes ahead and knocks.  A very pleasant-looking middle class WOMAN
answers the door.

          JEFFREY
     Hello. uh. my name is Jeffrey
     Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?

          MRS. WILLIAMS
     Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back
any minute now. You're welcome to wait.
Is it urgent?

47. INT. WILLIAMS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT



          JEFFREY
     I just wanted to ask him a few questions,
     that's all. Maybe I better go.

          MRS. WILLIAMS
     Really, he'll be home soon, would you like
     a cup of coffee?

          JEFFREY
          (thinks a bit)
     Alright.

48. INT. WILLIAMS' KITCHEN - NIGHT

She leads him back to the kitchen where she has him sit at the kitchen
table.  She pours him a cup of coffee.

          MRS. WILLIAMS
     I was sorry to hear about your father. I
     know your mother from church. It's such a
     shame.

          JEFFREY
     Yeah, I know.

          MRS. WILLIAMS
     Would you like a piece of cake?

          JEFFREY
     No. No thank you.

          MRS. WILLIAMS
     It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan
     Hines' devil's food. real good.

          JEFFREY
     Yeah. okay.

49. INT. WILLIAMS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Out in the living room, SANDY WILLIAMS and her BOYFRIEND, MIKE SHAW,
come up from the basement.  They are both carrying books.

Sandy is a very good looking, high school senior and Mike is a big,
handsome football player type.

50. INT. WILLIAMS' KITCHEN - NIGHT

          MRS. WILLIAMS
     Sandy?.

Sandy and Mike come into the kitchen.  Jeffrey has a big piece of chocolate cake in his mouth.

          MRS. WILLIAMS
          (continuing)
     Jeffery, this is my daughter, Sandy, and.
     her boyfriend, Mike.

They all say "Hi" to one another.

          SANDY
     Mike's gotta go.
          (to Jeffrey)
     Nice to meet you.

          MIKE
     Yeah, nice meetin' yuh.

          JEFFREY
     Yeah. It was nice meeting you too.

They leave and go out the front door.

          MRS. WILLIAMS
          (smiles)
     He comes over to study.

          JEFFREY
          (smiles big)
     Yeah.

The front door opens.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS (V.O.)
     Pam?

          MRS. WILLIAMS
     In the kitchen, John!

Detective Williams comes into the kitchen surprised to see Jeffrey.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     Oh. Hello, Jeffrey. what's up?

He kisses his wife.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     Come into the study a minute.

          JEFFREY
          (getting up)
     Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.

          MRS. WILLIAMS
     Certainly.

Jeffrey follows Detective Williams into his study.

                              CUT TO:

51. INT. DETECTIVE WILLIAMS' STUDY - NIGHT

Detective Williams' study is filled with filing cabinets.  The desk has
two phones and is covered with papers and folders and a picture of Mrs.
Williams and Sandy.  The police radio is asking for Detective Williams as
they enter.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
          (to Jeffrey)
     Shut the door.

Detective Williams speaks through the radio while Jeffrey shuts the door.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
          (continuing; in radio)
     Detective Williams here. yeah. Tell him
     to go to Sergeant Milton. yeah, copy.
     (clicks off radio, turns to Jeffrey)
     Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is
     very interesting to us. Very interesting.
     I know you must be curious to know more.
     (scratches the middle of his back)
     But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask
     you not only not to tell anyone about your
     find, but also not to ask more about the
     case. One day. when it's all sewed up, I'll
     let you know all the details. Right now,
     though. I can't.

          JEFFREY
     I understand. I'm just real curious like
     you said.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     I was the same way when I was you age. I
     guess that's what got me into this business.

          JEFFREY
     It must be great.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     And it's horrible too.
          (a cold look comes over
           Detective Williams)
     I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to
     be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand.

Jeffrey studies Detective Williams' face as they walk back to the living
room.

52. INT. WILLIAMS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          JEFFREY
      (calling into the kitchen)
     Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.

          MRS. WILLIAMS
     (coming out from the kitchen)
     Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet
     you, Jeffrey.

          JEFFREY
     Say "goodnight" to Sandy.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     We will. Good night.

Jeffrey leaves and they shut the door behind him.



53. EXT. WILLIAMS HOME - NIGHT

As Jeffrey leaves the light of the front yard and enters onto the dark
sidewalk, he hears Sandy call out behind him.

          SANDY
     Are you the one that found the ear.

Jeffrey stops and turns around.  Sandy comes up to him.

          JEFFREY
     Yeah, how did you know?

          SANDY
          (coyly)
     I just know, that's all. I remember you
     from Central.

54. EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

They slowly walk down the street together.

          JEFFREY
     Oh yeah?

          SANDY
     You were pretty popular. Didn't you run
     for some office?

          JEFFREY
     Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be
     studying or something.

          SANDY
     Am I bothering you?

          JEFFREY
     No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?

          SANDY
     Yes.

          JEFFREY
     How is Central these days?

          SANDY
     Terrible. boring.

          JEFFREY
     What else is new?. right?

          SANDY
     Yeah. What are you doing now?

          JEFFREY
     I'm home from school. My father's in the
     hospital.

          SANDY
     That's too bad.

          JEFFREY
     What do you know about the ear?. anything?

          SANDY
     Didn't my father tell you not to talk about
     it?
          (she smiles)

          JEFFREY
     Come on. you brought it up. Do you know
     anything?

          SANDY
     I don't really know much but bits and pieces
     . I hear things. My room is right above my
     father's office. The ear. there's no corpse
     in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come
     off a living person. That's direct from the
     Coroner's Office. The person is unknown.
     There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on,
     but I think there are some people who were
     brought in for questioning on a murder case
     that could have something to do with the ear.
     I heard some of the same names.

          JEFFREY
     Do you know who was brought in for
     questioning?

          SANDY
     There were at least three, maybe four. But
     a name that keeps coming up is this woman
     who lives in an apartment building very
     close to your house and also close to the
     field where you found the ear. There's
     also a business man over by the Franklin
     factory district that was questioned. and
     a musician. and some others.

          JEFFREY
     Were all these people questioned this
     afternoon?

          SANDY
     No. this has been going on for some time
     . several months. About six months ago
     some parts of bodies were found down by
     the river. They were from people who were
     reported missing. They never found one
     complete body. only parts.

          JEFFREY
     The ear is from a missing person maybe?

          SANDY
     Maybe so.

          JEFFREY
     It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know
     what building the woman lives in?

          SANDY
     Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy.
     They've had her under surveillance for a
     couple of months, except I don't know what
     they've found out because my father isn't
     in charge of her.

          JEFFREY
     I guess you have to get back home soon?

          SANDY
     Not really, why?
          (then she understands)
     You want to see the building?. Come on,
     I'll show you.

                              CUT TO:

55. EXT. LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT

Jeffrey and Sandy walk through the light of a street light.  The street
sign "LINCOLN ST" can be read.  They walk into darkness and continue down
to an apartment building on the right side of the street.

          SANDY
     (nodding toward building)
     That's the building. She lives on the
     Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long
     . the police are watching.

          JEFFREY
     Where are they?

          SANDY
     I don't know. you're not supposed to see
     them. They're supposed to see you.

They begin walking slowly back to Sandy's house.

          JEFFREY
     Did they find out anything when they
     questioned her?

          SANDY
     I don't know. like I said, she's not my
     father's case.

          JEFFREY
     Oh yeah. What about those other people?
     . Anything?

          SANDY
     My father is watching the businessman.
     The businessman had a partner who
     disappeared. left his whole business and
     family, his wife and two kids. They think
     he's been murdered.

          JEFFREY
     You really do hear a lot, don't you?

          SANDY
     Yeah, I guess so.
     (they continue walking)
     What are you going to do now that you're
     home?

          JEFFREY
     I have to help out in my father's hardware
     store. they're giving me sort of my own
     hours for a while. which is nice.

          SANDY
     Still, it must be kinda rough.

          JEFFREY
     It's not bad. but it's bad enough.
     it's a lot worse for my father.
          (Jeffrey points to a house)
     I used to know a kid who lived there and who
     had the biggest tongue in the world.

Jeffrey and Sandy both laugh.

          SANDY
     What happened to him?

          JEFFREY
     I don't know. he moved away.

                              CUT TO:

56. EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

A LONG SHOT

Jeffrey and Sandy walking and talking, sometimes laughing in the distance,
while the MUSIC theme, haunting yet warm, plays over.

57. EXT. WILLIAMS HOME - NIGHT

They arrive back at Sandy's home.

CLOSER ON JEFFREY AND SANDY

in front of Sandy's home.

          SANDY
     I've gotta go in.

          JEFFREY
     Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking
     to you.

Sandy just looks at him shyly before she turns to go up the front walk.

          JEFFREY
          (continuing)
     I guess I'll see you sometime.



          SANDY
     I guess so. Like you said. It's a
     strange world.

          JEFFREY
          (smiles)
     Yeah. Good bye.

Jeffrey watches as Sandy goes inside her house.  He watches her house for
a moment and sees her cross the living room.  He turns and walks away.

Again, the MYSTERIOUS CHORDS OF MUSIC swell up as Jeffrey walks through
the night.

                              CUT TO:

58. INT. BEAUMONT'S HARDWARE STORE - DAY

Jeffrey is poking around in the back room.  He picks up some bug spraying
devices.  He yells out to an old black man who works in the store.

          JEFFREY
     Hey, Ed, okay if I borrow these bug spraying
     rigs later on?

Ed peers into the back room.  Spots Jeffrey.

          ED
     Listen Bud. If you need to spray for bugs
     they're yours.  It causes me no pain.

          JEFFREY
     Okidoke Ed. Thanks.

                              CUT TO:

59. EXT. BEAUMONT'S HARDWARE STORE - DAY

Jeffrey puts the stuff in the trunk of the car.  There are several "Awake"
magazines there too.  He gets in the front seat and drives off.

                              CUT TO:

60. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR - DAY

Jeffrey driving.  He looks at his watch.  It is 3:30.

61. EXT. CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Jeffrey is parked across the street from the school.  High school kids
are pouring out the front door.  In a moment he sees Sandy come out with
two or three other girls.  They walk down the sidewalk away from Jeffrey.

He starts the car and slowly follows them to the corner, where he pulls
up alongside of them. very close. Sandy suddenly recognizes him.

          JEFFREY
     You hungry or thirsty, or both?

          SANDY
          (taken back)
     I don't know.

          JEFFREY
     I'd like to talk to you about something.

          SANDY
     Just a minute. pull over and wait a
     minute.

Sandy pulls her girlfriends away from Jeffrey's car and says something to
them.  There is some whispering and giggling and then,

          SANDY
          (to the girls)
     Please, don't say anything to Mike.
     promise?

The girls promise.  Sandy goes around and gets in the car.

          JEFFREY
     I don't want to cause any trouble.

          SANDY
     I'm here, aren't I?

          JEFFREY
     (smiling as though he knew)
     I guess Mike's got some sort of sports
     practice in the afternoon.

          SANDY
     Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too
     smart.

                              CUT TO:

62. INT. DINER - DAY

Jeffrey and Sandy are sitting in a booth.  Jeffrey's grilled cheese on
white bread and a coke have just arrived along with Sandy's coke.

          SANDY
     Alright, now tell me. What is it?

          JEFFREY
     There are opportunities in life for gaining
     knowledge and experience. sometimes, in
     some cases. it's necessary to take a risk.
     I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could
     learn a lot by getting into that woman's
     apartment. you know. sneak in and hide
     and observe.

          SANDY
     You said it was a strange world.
     and you're the strangest part of it. Are
     you crazy.she is possibly involved in
     murder. This gives me the creeps.

          JEFFREY
     Settle down. I have a plan which I think
     will work. There is very little for you
     to do, but I do need your help.
     .Aren't you curious about my plan?

          SANDY
     (thinking and intrigued, plus she
       is beginning to like Jeffrey)
     It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.

          JEFFREY
          (getting excited)
     Alright. the first thing is to get into her
     apartment and open a window that I could
     crawl into later.

          SANDY
     Now, how are you going to do that?

          JEFFREY
     Right out in the car I happen to have some
     old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will
     go to her apartment and be the pest control
     man. I will spray her apartment. After a
     few minutes you will knock on her door,
     drawing her attention away from me and I
     will then jimmy a window.

          SANDY
     What will I say when she comes to the door?

          JEFFREY
     You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a
     few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't
     have to keep her very long. a few seconds
     is all I'll need. Whatiya think?

          SANDY
     I don't know. it sounds like a good
     daydream, . but actually doing it is too
     weird. too dangerous.

          JEFFREY
     Let's just try the first part. If that
     goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one
     will suspect us, because no one would
     believe two people like us would be crazy
     enough to do something like this.

          SANDY
     You've got a point there.

                              CUT TO:

63. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET-DAY

Jeffrey and Sandy are in the car.  Jeffrey is struggling to put on the old overalls.

          JEFFREY
     Now. we'll walk over so there's no license
     plates and you give me at least three
     minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I
     need time to find a good window .alright?

          SANDY
     Alright.

          JEFFREY
     Let's go.

64. EXT. LINCOLN STREET - DAY

They get out of the car. Sandy has the "Awake" magazines.

          JEFFREY
     Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute,
     what's her name?

          SANDY
     Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh
     Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number,
     bright boy.

          JEFFREY
     Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good
     luck . three minutes, no sooner.

          SANDY
     Alright. Good luck, yourself.

Jeffrey takes off in the direction of the apartment building.

                              CUT TO:

65. EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Jeffrey walks up the front steps and goes in the double outer doors.

66. INT. LOBBY - APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

He looks up and down the mailboxes and finally finds "D. Vallens,
Apartment Number 710."

Jeffrey goes into the lobby.

                              CUT TO:

67. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Jeffrey climbs the stairs.  An OLD LADY is making her way down the stairs.
She sees Jeffrey and his rig.

          OLD LADY
     Well, it's about time you came.

Jeffrey forces a smile at her and after she's gone.

          JEFFREY
          (to himself)
     That's a good sign.

He keeps climbing.  He arrives at the Seventh Floor. and finds Number 710.
He knocks and waits.  He looks around. the hallway is empty.

DOROTHY VALLENS opens the door.  She is a very beautiful woman in her
late thirties.  She has a beautiful full figure, dark eyes, black thick
wavy hair.  Full red lips.  Right now, however, she looks a bit tired and
a bit frumpy in an old terrycloth robe.

          DOROTHY
     Yes? What is it?

          JEFFREY
     Pest control. gotta do your apartment.

          DOROTHY
     Oh God, that stuff stinks.

          JEFFREY
          (as he goes in)
     Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.

          DOROTHY
     Oh yeah, that's good.

68. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jeffrey goes all around the baseboards, spraying.  All the while he's
getting a good look around the apartment.

There is a window above the kitchen sink out to the fire escape.  Jeffrey
looks around to see what Dorothy is doing and she is watching him spraying.
The apartment is smaller than he thought, so he sprays the kitchen very
slowly and makes believe the sprayer is jammed.

Suddenly, there is knocking at the door.

          DOROTHY
     What is this. Grand Central Station?

She opens the door.  Jeffrey looks. It's not Sandy. A MAN, with a yellow
sports coat, is standing there.  Jeffrey begins to sweat, because the MAN
looked around Dorothy to see him.  Dorothy says something to the Man which
Jeffrey cannot hear.

The next time Jeffrey looks up, the Man is gone.  The whole thing looks
to be turning out badly when Jeffrey spots a key on the counter.  On a
long shot, he steals it just as the front door shuts. He wraps things up
and gets out.

          JEFFREY
          (to Dorothy)
     That oughta do it.

          DOROTHY
     Yeah.


69.      INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Jeffrey leaves.  Out on the stairs, he finds Sandy with her "Awake"
magazines.

          SANDY
     Are you alright?

          JEFFREY
     Yeah. let's get outta here. What
     happened?

As they go downstairs,

          SANDY
     I was just about to go to the door, when
     that man did my job for me. Was it alright?

          JEFFREY
     Yes and no. Did you recognize him?

          SANDY
     No. I only saw his back. He went down
     another stairwell at the end of the hall.

          JEFFREY
     I didn't get a good look at him either, but
     he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to
     get a window, but I found this key.
          (he shows it to her)
     Pretty nifty, huh?

          SANDY
     Yeah, if it opens the door.

          JEFFREY
     Yeah.

70.      INT. LOBBY - APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

They get to the door of the apartment building.

          JEFFREY
     You go first.

71. EXT. LINCOLN STREET - DAY

They leave the building separately.  When Jeffrey gets to the car,
Sandy isn't there.  He looks around.  He starts the car and drives off.

There, up ahead, he spots her.  He pulls over and she gets in.

          SANDY
     So. what's next?

          JEFFREY
     Pretty clever. Are you game for more?

          SANDY
     I owe you. since I goofed up this one.

          JEFFREY
     You didn't goof it up, but. you still
     owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight.
     It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?

          SANDY
     Yes. I do.

          JEFFREY
     Well, it's Friday night and you're a
     beautiful girl. I guess you would have
     a date. that does that.

72. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/WILLIAMS HOME - DAY

Jeffrey is driving Sandy home.

          SANDY
     You really want to do this, don't you?

          JEFFREY
     I don't want you to get involved, really,
     I mean, I do, but if something went wrong
     I mean, like you said, they may be involved
     in murder.

They pull up in front of Sandy's house.

          SANDY
     (making up her mind - against
         her better judgment)
     I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game
     tonight anyway and he'll never miss me.
     Afterwards he can go out with the guys.
     Just so the record is kept straight though,
     I love Mike. What do want me to do?

          JEFFREY
     (studies her a moment, then)
     First of all, we'll have a nice dinner.
     Try to find out where Dorothy sings.

          SANDY
     I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on
     Route 7.

          JEFFREY
     Great. I'll pick you up around eight
     o'clock. Is that good?

          SANDY
     Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may
     think it's strange. I'll walk over to your
     house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.

          JEFFREY
     Okay. You better get out before someone
     sees us.

Sandy gets out of the car and without turning around walks into her
house.  Jeffrey calls out after her.

          JEFFREY
     See ya!

                              DISSOLVE TO:

73. INT. BEAUMONTS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

INSERT T.V. SCREEN

The television is on.  Some crime show is playing, but the SOUND is
very low.

The FAMILY DOCTOR is over and is giving Mrs. Beaumont an injection of
medicine.  Aunt Barbara is sitting nearby.

          DR. GYNDE
     That will take care of you, Frances, for
     another week. I don't want you to overdo
     things either. Take it very easy.

          AUNT BARBARA
     I'll see to it, Bill.

          DR. GYNDE
     Good.

          MRS. BEAUMONT
     I feel fine.

          DR. GYNDE
     That's not the point. You're under a great
     deal of stress. don't overdo it. don't
     be foolish.

Jeffrey enters the room - to say goodnight.

          JEFFREY
     Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick.
     What's going on?

          AUNT BARBARA
     I'm not sick.

Jeffrey points to his head and makes a circular "crazy" gesture.  They
all laugh, except Aunt Barbara.

          AUNT BARBARA
          (continuing)
     We'll see who stays in my will.

They laugh again.

          JEFFREY
          (to his mother)
     Can I use the car tonight?

          MRS. BEAUMONT
     Of course, Jeffrey.

They say their goodnights.

74. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR - NIGHT

Jeffrey and Sandy are looking at each other.  Jeffrey turns back to
driving.

Sandy watches Jeffrey drive then she turns and watches the stores and
shops go by.

When she is turned away, Jeffrey turns and look at her.  Sandy is
thinking.

          SANDY
     What's the plan.

          JEFFREY
     First of all, we're going to the Slow Club
     to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for
     awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway,
     and then also we'll know she is there and
     not in her apartment.

          SANDY
     Brilliant.

          JEFFREY
     Then we'll drive back to her apartment and
     I will plant myself there.

          SANDY
     This is not my usual Friday night!

                              CUT TO:

75. EXT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT

The SLOW CLUB is a sleazy night club on the outskirts of town.  It
has a dirty trash-strewn parking lot in front of it, where Jeffrey and
Sandy park.  They get out of the car and enter the club.

                              CUT TO:

76. INT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT

          SLEAZY MAITRE D'
          (French accent)
     Good evening. two?

          JEFFREY
     Yeah. Could we get a small table in the
     back?

          SLEZY MAITRE D'
     Surely, come this way.

They follow him and are seated.

          MAITRE D'
     May I get you something to drink?


          JEFFREY
     I'd like an ice-cold Heineken.

          SANDY
     (she might as well)
     That sounds good.

          JEFFREY
     Two.

          MAITRE D'
     Two Heinekens, thank you.

The Maitre d' leaves.

On stage a FAT COMIC is telling jokes.  The jokes are tailored for this
kind of working-class crowd.  The people are laughing.  The place is
almost full.  Jeffrey and Sandy are taking it all in.

          JEFFREY
          (to Waiter)
     When does Dorothy Vallens come on?

          WAITER
          (flustered; overworked)
     I don't know. pretty soon. Who knows.

After the Waiter leaves,

          SANDY
     That guy was filled with information.

They pour their beers.

          JEFFREY
          (raising his glass)
     Here's to. an interesting experience.

          SANDY
     I'll drink to that.

They drink.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

77. INT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT

Later. Jeffrey and Sandy have just finished dinner.  The M.C. is arranging
a floral art deco microphone and a SAXOPHONE PLAYER, a BASS PLAYER, and a
DRUMMER are on stage.

          M.C.
          (very low key)
     Ladies and gentlemen. The Blue Lady.
     Miss Dorothy Vallens.

There is quite a round of applause, even though most people continue
laughing, talking, and drinking.  Dorothy Vallens comes out on stage.



She smiles. The house lights are still up. As she sings the first lines
of "BLUE MOON" the house lights go down and a blue spot light comes up on
her as she sings the word, "Blue." This is a very sexy and slow version of
the song.

During the song, Jeffrey and Sandy look at one another with the thought
that this is the woman whose apartment they are about to break into.

Jeffrey and Sandy leave as Dorothy starts her next song, "BLUE VELVET."
They hear the first few lines before they get out the door.

78. EXT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT

They hurry to the car, get in, and drive off.

                              CUT TO:

79. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR - NIGHT

Jeffrey and Sandy drive through dark areas of the city.  They don't talk
as they drive, but again they sneak glances at one another.

80. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT

They turn in to the street where Dorothy Vallens lives and glide to a stop
close to the building.  Jeffery cuts the engine.

It is very quiet.  Both are looking around to see if anyone is out or
watching.  Jeffrey tries to look up out the front windshield to the
Seventh Floor.  It is dark.  Sandy moves.  Every tiny sound is heard.
Sandy looks at Jeffrey for some time, then back at the building.

          SANDY
     Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.

          JEFFREY
     Why not?

          SANDY
     It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I
     shouldn't have told you.

          JEFFREY
     It'll be okay. I don't think you should
     wait out here though. I think you should
     go home. Can you drive this car?

          SANDY
     Yeah. but.

          JEFFREY
     Leave it in the front of your house for me.
     okay?

          SANDY
     O.K.

          JEFFREY
     Could you wait a little while. this key may
     not fit.

          SANDY
     . I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't
     make any sense. Let's go somewhere and
     have some coffee.

          JEFFREY
     I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow
     and tell you how it went.

          SANDY
     I. I don't want to see you tomorrow.
     Mike's coming over.

          JEFFREY
     Oh, okay. can I call?

          SANDY
     Okay. yeah, call.

          JEFFREY
     Look. it can wait till Sunday.

          SANDY
     Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope
     you can sneak out okay. You're going to
     wait until she's asleep?

          JEFFREY
     Yeah.

          SANDY
     I'm going to wait here until she comes.

          JEFFREY
     Are you sure?

          SANDY
     I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and
     know she's on her way up. Okay?

Jeffrey nods.

          JEFFREY
     Okay. thanks.

          SANDY
     I don't know if you're a detective or a
     pervert.

          JEFFREY
     That's for me to know and for you to find
     out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?

          SANDY
     Okay, okay. Bye.

Jeffrey gets out of the car and shuts the door.  He looks in one more time
at Sandy.  They stare at each other silently.

Jeffrey can see her lips in the black darkness of the car.  Sandy watches
him cross the lawn and go into the apartment building.  She slides over and
sits in the driver's seat.

                              CUT TO:

81. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Jeffrey hurries up the stairs to the Seventh Floor.

SOMEONE comes out of an apartment just as Jeffrey gets to the Seventh Floor.

He goes up another flight of stairs to the Eighth Floor and waits until
the man goes downstairs.

Jeffrey then goes back to the Seventh Floor and goes to Door 710.
He takes out the key and looks around. No one.  He inserts the key.
It fits.  He turns it.  The door opens.

82. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

He quickly enters the very dark apartment and shuts the door.  It takes a
moment for his eyes to adjust to the darkness.  Soon he finds his way
around.  He decides on the closet to hide in.  However before he goes in
to the closet he slowly surveys the apartment as well as he can in the
darkness.  He goes down the hallway to the back bedroom.

Across the hallway he opens another door and is surprised to find an empty
child's room.  In the child's room he sees a small pointed hat with a
propeller on top.  The kind that plays music when the propeller turns.
The hat is sitting silently on the bed post.  He quietly closes the door.
He returns to the closet.  Once inside, he checks out how much he can see.
Through the slats he has a view of half the apartment.  This is where he
will stay.  He moves around some to relax.  He takes several deep breaths.
He looks at his watch.  It says "10:17."

83. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT

Sandy sits in the car, carefully watching the apartment building and
street.

84. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

In the closet, Jeffrey shakes his shoulders and moves around some to
stretch his muscles which are getting tired.  Again, he takes several
deep breaths.  He looks at his watch - it says 12:45.

          JEFFREY
          (to himself)
     Oh no, hurry up Dorothy. Come on!. and I
     gotta pee. Great. it's now or never.

Jeffrey sneaks out of the closet and makes his way across the bedroom to
the door of the bathroom.  His foot hits the door and it makes a loud
noise.  He freezes.

85. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

He moves again into the bathroom.  He starts to pee.

          JEFFREY
     Heineken.

                              CUT TO:

86. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT

Suddenly Sandy sits up alert.

87. EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

A car drives up and a MAN helps Dorothy Vallens get out.  They walk into
the building.

                              CUT TO:

88. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Jeffrey instinctively has flushed the toilet and because everything else
is so quiet the water SOUNDS seem very loud.

89. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT

Sandy begins to honk the horn.

90. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Unable to hear the warning horn, Jeffrey nonchalantly leaves the bathroom
as the tank is still filling.

SUDDENLY, he hears something. a key going in the door.  He bolts toward
the closet.  He flies inside it and is swinging the door shut as the front
door opens.

Just as suddenly, the toilet tank gets full and the water shuts off -
SILENCE, except for Dorothy Vallens at the front door.

          DOROTHY (V.O.)
          (we're watching Jeffrey trying to
            control frightened breathing in
     the dark closet)
     Thanks Jimmy, see you tomorrow. You want a
     drink, or something?

          JIMMY (V.O.)
     I better get back. thanks anyway.

          DOROTHY
     Goodnight.

          JIMMY
     Goodnight now.

The front door shuts and the living room lights go on.  Jeffrey can see
Dorothy come toward him.  She walks RIGHT UP, almost to his face, when
the phone RINGS.

She turns immediately and goes to answer it.  Jeffrey almost passes out.
He thought he'd had it.  He overhears.


          DOROTHY
          (on the phone)
     Hello. yes. yes sir, Frank. Let me
     talk to him. Please Frank, sir. I like
     to sing Blue Velvet. Don? It's okay.
     Don't worry. Don??. can you hear me?
     Is little Donny OK? Is he there? Don? You
     mean Meadow Lane? Frank?! What's the
     matter with him? I know. When? Okay. In
     an hour. I'll be sweet. Momma loves you.
     Okay Frank, sir.

She hangs up the phone hard and puts her head in her hands.

          DOROTHY
          (to herself)
     Frank, you son of a bitch!

She goes and sits down and starts chewing a fingernail.  She nervously
gets up again and looks at a framed photograph for a moment then hides
the photograph under a pillow on the couch.  She puts on a record, "FOR
YOUR PRECIOUS LOVE."  She sits back down and chews her nail again,
listening to the MUSIC; she starts to cry.  She stops herself and takes
the record off.  She starts taking off her stocking.  She then takes off
her dress.

Underneath, she has on a bra and panties.  She crosses the living room,
goes down the hallway into the bathroom.

Jeffrey can't see her too well now.  She takes off her panties in the
bathroom.  She is now naked.  She looks at herself in the mirror.  We see
Jeffrey's face as he watches her.  She disappears from view completely and
we HEAR her start a SHOWER.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

91. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jeffrey's face.  He sees Dorothy - in a towel - come toward him again.
He quickly moves back into the closet as far as he can.

She opens the door, reaches in and gets a blue velvet robe.  She doesn't
see Jeffrey even though he isn't well hidden.  She closes the door.  It
CLICKS shut.

Jeffrey is in almost total darkness.  He listens.  He can HEAR WALKING
around, then silence.  He hears the kitchen sink WATER RUNNING.

He HEARS her WALKING AGAIN.  Now he can see her.  She sits down on her
bed.  She looks up.  Just as Jeffrey shifts his weight.  She looks at the
closet strangely, but then calmly picks up a book and thumbs through it.
She slowly gets up.

Jeffrey doesn't know what is up.  He looks but she walks out of view.

SUDDENLY, he hears a DRAWER OPEN, and just as suddenly, the CLOSET DOOR
FLIES OPEN, and there she is with a pistol pointed right at him.  When
she realizes that SOMEONE IS REALLY THERE, she SCREAMS ONCE, very loud.

          DOROTHY
          (crazy scream, then)
     GET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your
     hands up, on your head. GO ON!! Get down
     on your knees - DO IT!! What are you
     doing? Who are you? What's your name?.
     WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

          JEFFREY
     Jeffrey.

          DOROTHY
     Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?

          JEFFREY
     Jeffrey nothing.

          DOROTHY
     You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.
          (reads his license)
     Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in
     my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?

          JEFFREY
     I wanted to see you.

          DOROTHY
     What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you
     here?

          JEFFREY
     Nobody.

          DOROTHY
     Shit. You better tell me something.

          JEFFREY
     I was. an experiment. Just to see if
     I could do it.

          DOROTHY
     An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.

          JEFFREY
     I sprayed your apartment. I took your key.
     I really didn't mean to do anything but
     see you.

          DOROTHY
     Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.

          JEFFREY
          (scared, nervous)
     . I saw you come in, talk on the phone.
     get undressed.

          DOROTHY
          (interrupting)
     The phone. What did you hear on the phone
     . Tell me. Word for word.

          JEFFREY
          (trying to remember)
     You said hello. to Frank. You wanted to
     talk to someone?. Don?. and little Donny.
     You said something about Momma loves you.
     and something about a Meadow Lane.
     something in an hour. I don't remember
     any more.

Dorothy stares at Jeffrey studying him for some time thinking.

          DOROTHY
     That's right. That's what I said. You
     have a good memory. Then what?

          JEFFREY
     Well.

          DOROTHY
     THEN WHAT?

          JEFFREY
     Then you got undressed.

          DOROTHY
     How many times have you sneaked into girls'
     apartments and watched them undress?

          JEFFREY
     (quietly; feeling guilty)
     Never before this.

          DOROTHY
     How'd you like it if someone sneaked into
     your house and watched you.
          (gets an idea)
     Get undressed. I want to see you.

          JEFFREY
     No. Come on.

          DOROTHY
     NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I
     want to see you.

          JEFFREY
     Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.

          DOROTHY
     No way.

Dorothy moves to the kitchen counter and gets a knife.  She goes to
Jeffrey.  Now she has a knife and a gun.  He's scared.

          DOROTHY
     Get undressed. I want to see you.

Jeffrey begins to undress. First he takes off his shoes and socks,
Then his shirt.  He undoes his belt and unzips his pants and takes them
off.  Now he is only in his underwear.

          DOROTHY
     STAND UP.

He does.

          DOROTHY
          (continuing)
     Come closer.

Dorothy has a strange look on her face.  She reaches out and pulls
Jeffrey's underpants down to his knees.  She looks at him.

          DOROTHY
          (whispering)
     What do you want from me?

          JEFFREY
     (quietly, getting very hot)
     I . I don't know.

          DOROTHY
          (whispering)
     What do you want?

Dorothy is getting very DREAMY and begins to talk in a childlike voice.
She opens her robe and pulls Jeffrey to her breasts.

          DOROTHY
     Don't move. don't look at me.

Jeffrey's eyes close with nervous ecstasy as Dorothy begins touching him.

          DOROTHY
     Do you like that?

          JEFFREY
     Yes.

He tries to touch her.

          DOROTHY
     Don't move or I'll kill you.

She looks at him.

          DOROTHY
          (continuing)
     Do you like talk like that?

          JEFFREY
     No.

          DOROTHY
     Lie down on the bed.

He lies down.  He looks frightened.

There's a KNOCK, KNOCK on the door.  Dorothy looks VERY frightened.  She
quickly moves a finger to her lips in a "quiet" sign and whispers to
Jeffrey.

          DOROTHY
          (whispers, frantic)
     Shut up. Hurry! Go in the closet. Don't
     say anything or you'll get killed. I mean
     it.

KNOCKING is heard louder at the door.  Jeffrey picks up all his clothes
and gets in the closet.  He's naked and hiding in the closet.  Dorothy
closes her robe and glides to the front door.

Jeffrey sees FRANK come in.

Frank is medium height and stocky with a burr hair cut.  He is wearing a
tight blue t-shirt and an old black sports jacket.  He's got on a pair of
blue jeans and boots.  He has a raw, mean sexuality - a "bomb about to go
off" - presence.

He comes into the room slowly, always looking at Dorothy.  He sits on the
couch.

          DOROTHY
     Hello, baby.

          FRANK
                      (annoyed, condescending)
     Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.

          DOROTHY
     Hello, daddy.

          FRANK
     (can't-you-remember-
     anything-attitude)
     . my bourbon.

Dorothy goes into the kitchen to get Frank his drink.  As she passes the
closet, Jeffrey can see the fear in her face.

She returns with a small glass of bourbon and hands it to Frank.  Frank
sips on it.

          FRANK
     . sit down. get your chair.

Dorothy brings a small chair over from the wall and sits down.  She
adjusts her robe.

          FRANK
          (studying her)
     . spread your legs.

Dorothy slowly spreads her legs.  She can see Jeffrey staring out of the
darkness of the closet at her.

          FRANK
     wider.

She opens her legs wider.  Frank looks at her crotch and drinks his
bourbon.  He stares at the floor for a moment, then slowly looks back at
Dorothy, her body - her crotch.

Dorothy looks up at the ceiling, waiting.  Frank suddenly reaches to his
belt, where he has a small canister and a mask.  He opens a valve on the
canister and places the mask over his nose and mouth.  The canister is
filled with helium, which makes Frank's voice very high and strange
sounding.  The result is frightening.

          FRANK
          (high voice)
     . mommy.

Dorothy jumps.  She keeps looking at the ceiling.

          FRANK
     (continuing, with high voice)
     . MOMMY!.

          DOROTHY
          (frightened)
     . mommy's here.

          FRANK
          (high voice)
     Baby wants to fuck.

Then, Frank's voice goes to normal.

          FRANK
     (normal voice, but loud - like
         an army order to himself)
     GET READY TO FUCK!

Frank goes to Dorothy and kneels down in front of her.  He takes one more
gasp of helium.

          FRANK
          (high voice)
     Baby wants blue velvet.

Dorothy opens her robe and gives a part of the robe to Frank.

          DOROTHY
          (whispering)
     Okay.

Frank slowly moves

Frank slowly moves his mouth to the robe and runs his lips along the
texture of the velvet.  His hands rub the velvet and feel Dorothy's body
underneath.  His hands start feeling her breasts as he sucks and bites the
velvet robe.

Dorothy is very frightened but she is getting hot in spite of her fear.
Then Frank, in a sort of sickening way, pulls Dorothy down to rug.  He
warns her.

          FRANK
     Don't look at me!

He begins stuffing part of the robe into her mouth.  Then, he pushes her
arms back and she keeps them back, letting Frank have his way.  Frank
sucks and bites the velvet coming out of her mouth, while he pinches and
feels her breasts in a strange, compulsive, timidly sickening way.
Dorothy is moaning.  Frank is breathing very heavily. He feels her crotch.

          FRANK
     Don't look at me!!!
     (heavy breathing)
     Daddy's home.

He starts stuffing the robe in his mouth now and he gets on top of Dorothy.
He starts humping her and pulling her nude body up and down him.  Faster
and faster, then he has a climax in his pants.  Dorothy's head is falling
back.  She can see Jeffrey blurred in the distance - in the closet.
Cautiously, she looks sideways at Frank.

          FRANK
          (screaming)
     Don't look at me!!!

He slugs her in the face.  His nose is running and he's stifling sobs from
deep within him.  On his hands and knees, he moves away.  The robe pulls
out of his mouth.  His breathing is even heavier now.  He stands and
begins to move around the apartment.  He goes to a wall, turns off the
lights, then turns and walks into the bathroom, all the while breathing
big, heavy breaths, trying to stop the crying.  Dorothy moans softly.

It gets very quiet and still for a moment.  Then, Jeffrey hears Frank
with his high helium voice talking to himself in the bathroom.  The high,
strange sound reverberates in the distance.  Jeffrey can't make it out -
soon, he hears Frank's high laughing.  Frank comes back into the living
room.  The mask is around his face.  All his breathing - every sound is
high . He laughs a little and crosses the darkened room to the door.

          FRANK
     Stay alive baby. See you next Christmas!

Frank leaves and shuts the door.  The apartment is silent except for
Dorothy's moans.

Jeffrey is stunned.  He doesn't move.  He watches Dorothy in the
half-light.  She rolls over and starts crying.  The crying is deep and
genuine.

Slowly, Jeffrey emerges from the closet and goes to her.  He bends down
and touches her.  She flinches and turns to see him.  She turns back
sobbing.  He tries to get her up.

          JEFFREY
     Why don't you come lie down. Come on, I'll
     help you.

She struggles up with Jeffrey's help and he takes her over to the bed.
She falls down on her side, turned toward the wall.  He covers her with
the sheet.

          DOROTHY
     Don't.
     (referring to the sheet)
     I don't like that. What do you want?

          JEFFREY
     Nothing. Are you alright?

          DOROTHY
     Sure I'm alright.
     (she starts crying again)

          JEFFREY
     I'll go then.

He starts to put on his underwear.  They're inside out.  He tries to turn
them around.

          DOROTHY
     Don?

          JEFFREY
     No.

          DOROTHY
     Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me.
     Please.

Jeffrey turns to her.  He studies her.  He reaches out and takes her
shoulders.  He moves down and holds her.

          DOROTHY
          (whispering)
     Thank you. honey.

          JEFFREY
          (whispering)
     It's okay. It's okay.

They lie together for a long silent moment.

          DOROTHY
     Do you like the way I feel?

          JEFFREY
          (hesitates)
     Yes.

          DOROTHY
     See my breasts?  . See?

Jeffrey looks.

          JEFFREY
     Yes.

          DOROTHY
     See my nipples?

          JEFFREY
     Yes.

          DOROTHY
          (whispering)
     You can kiss them if you want. Fell them
     . They're getting hard.

Jeffrey starts to move closer.  Dorothy closes her eyes.

          DOROTHY
          (continuing)
     Go ahead. I don't mind.

Jeffrey can't help himself.  He licks and sucks her nipples and feels her
breasts.  They both are getting very hot.

          DOROTHY
     Feel me.

Jeffrey is all over her now.  Dorothy suddenly seems to recognize him.

          DOROTHY
     You can hit me, if you want to.

          JEFFREY
     No. please. I won't.

Dorothy arches back and whining she throws her head back hard against the
wall.

          JEFFREY
     Stop it!

She moves and won't let him feel her anymore.  She holds his hands away.

          DOROTHY
          (whispering)
     Do you like me?

          JEFFREY
          (whispering)
     Yes, I like you.

          DOROTHY
          (whispering)
     You can be my special friend and come and
     put that in me.

They start making love.  Suddenly, Dorothy starts crying.

          JEFFREY
     What's the matter?

Suddenly Dorothy slaps Jeffrey in the face. very hard.

          DOROTHY
     Get off me.

Jeffrey gets off her, pressing his hand to his face.  Dorothy goes into
the bathroom crying all the way.  Jeffrey sits, confused.

Suddenly Jeffrey hears a horrible scream from Dorothy.  A true scream of
horror.  He rushes into the bathroom to see what is wrong.

92. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

She is just flushing something down the toilet.  The water SOUND rushes.
He turns to her.  She is trembling and in a state of shock.

          DOROTHY
     I made it go down the toilet.

          JEFFREY
     What?

He looks in the swirling water. It looks like an ear revolving around and
around then whatever it is disappears.

          DOROTHY
     I made it go down the toilet.

Jeffrey looks up. he sees written with a bar of soap the words "look down"
on the mirror.

He looks down into the sink.  At the bottom he sees a small clot of blood
and a smear of fresher blood.

Jeffrey suddenly remembers mentally Frank's high helium voice reverberating
in the bathroom.

93. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

FLASHBACK

Frank in bathroom.

94. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

FLASHBACK

Frank at door saying "see you next Christmas."

95. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

          JEFFREY
          (inner voice)
     Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has
     left a present for Dorothy? What was it?
     An ear? Another ear?!!
          (out loud, to Dorothy)
     What was it?

          DOROTHY
     (strangely - extremely frightened
       now that Jeffrey may have left it)
     Do you know?

          JEFFREY
     No.



          DOROTHY
     (breathing heavily, strangely)
     You don't?

          JEFFREY
     No. What is happening?

          DOROTHY
     Maybe you don't know. I know you though.
     You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where
     you live and I know ways to get you and I
     know ways to kill you.

          JEFFREY
     Please don't talk like that. You're upset.
     I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I
     did. I better go.

          DOROTHY
     Go then. I can't let you put it in me now
     but I want you. I like you.

          JEFFREY
     Then don't talk about killing.

          DOROTHY
     Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?
          (laughs)
     Sometimes I think it would be fun.
          (strange smile)
     Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't
     open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little
     secret.
          (she leans close)
     I want to die.

          JEFFREY
     Don't say that.

          DOROTHY
     It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day
     I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep
     now.

          JEFFREY
     (frightened by her craziness)
     O.K.

He takes another look at the blood in the bottom of the sink.  He takes
another look at the beautiful dark troubled eyes of Dorothy Vallens, and
turns, goes through the hall to the living room.  He crosses slowly to the
door, suddenly he turns back and enters the hallway going down to the
bathroom.  He stops and looks at Dorothy who is turned away from him.
She stares into the sink.  Jeffrey notices that a square of fabric has
been cut from the bottom of her blue velvet robe

          JEFFREY
     I'm leaving now.

She is whispering something to herself.

          DOROTHY
          (very faint whisper)
     Help me. help me. please help me.

Jeffrey doesn't know what he can do.

96. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jeffrey turns back, goes through the living room.  He looks around and
sees the empty bourbon glass of Frank's.  Suddenly he remembers the
photograph that Dorothy hid.  He picks up the pillow and sees a picture
of a smiling man and a small boy standing next to him wearing a pointed
hat with a propeller. He turns the photo over and finds an old marriage
license.  It reads: Dorothy Vallens to Don.

          JEFFREY (V.O.)
     Don. Oh my God.

He hides the photo again.  He sees Dorothy's telephone.  He memorizes the
number - moving his lips with each digit.  He goes to the front door and
opens it quietly.

97. EXT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

He looks out into the hall.  It's empty.

97A. INT. HALLWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

He quickly goes to the back stairway and down the stairs.  These steps are
cement and his feet make echoing sounds which seem very loud.  He goes
through a door marked "EXIT".

98. EXT. LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT

. and comes out, crosses a lawn and goes out onto the sidewalk.

He walks along taking in deep cleansing breaths.  He looks at his watch.
2:30.  He feels so confused, exhilarated, so uneasy.  He secretly worries
about what he's gotten into.

99. INT. BEAUMONTS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Jeffrey enters the house. THE CAMERA RUSHES along the rug in the dark to a
foot.  The lights come on.  PAN UP the leg to Mrs. Beaumont waiting in a
chair, staring.

          JEFFREY
          (startled)
     God. you scared me.

          MRS. BEAUMONT
     Is something wrong? What's happened to
     your face?

          JEFFREY
     Nothing. I'm fine.

          MRS. BEAUMONT
     You can't just stay out half the night and
     carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some
     order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have
     been nice to call your father when you got
     home but now it is much too late.

FADE TO:

100. INT. JEFFREY'S BEDROOM - DAY

Jeffrey gets out of bed and goes to the phone.  He dials a number.

          JEFFREY
     Louise Wertham, please. okay.
          (waits)
     Louise?. Jeffrey. Hi. What's up?
          (pause)
     MARRIED?! Good night! Louise! Are
     you kidding?
          (long pause)
     Well, Louise, I wish you a lot of
     luck and if things don't work out,
I think you should go into comedy.

Jeffrey hangs up the phone hard.  He shakes his head.

101. INT. BEAUMONTS' HARDWARE STORE - DAY

Jeffrey's drinking a cup of coffee behind the counter in the store.
He thinks.  He takes another drink of coffee and sets the cup down.
He clasps his hands behind his back and begins pacing up and down.

          JEFFREY
          (to himself, out loud)
     How can I help her? I can't tell her to go
     to Detective Williams. She'll think I'm a
     policeman. She has my address. She can go
     there. if she has to. I'll tell her. and
     her. and she thinks I'm Don. her husband?
     Where the hell is Don? - maybe he died.

Jeffrey dials the phone.

          JEFFREY
     Hello?. Mrs. Williams?. This is Jeffrey
     Beaumont. Fine. Okay. Is Sandy there?
     Okay. Hi Sandy. Can you talk? He is?.
     Well, I guess I'll talk to you later on.
     It went okay. I'll tell you about it.
     Dinner?. Tomorrow night? Seven o'clock,
     yeah, sounds good. Okay. he's still in
     the hospital. Okay, yeah. See you
     tomorrow. thanks.

102. INT. HOSPITAL LABORATORY - DAY

The searching, mysterious MUSIC plays over while,

A DOCTOR is looking at various blood samples under a powerful microscope.
Various sophisticated gadgets are seen in CLOSEUPS.

          JEFFREY (V.O.)
     This is what my father's disease looks like?

          DR. GYNDE
     Yes.

The BLOOD is seen in CLOSEUP. Cells are moving.

The Doctor makes a change in magnification.  The cells are huge - then,
even bigger.  They are so big we can hear them moving.

103. EXT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT

The parking lot is half-full.  A strong wind is blowing trash around.
Jeffrey parks his car.

104. INT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT

. and enters the club. He speaks to the Maitre d'.

          JEFFREY
     A table in back, please.

          MAITRE D'
     Certainly

Dorothy is singing her opening song as the Maitre d' seats Jeffrey.

          JEFFREY
     I'll have an ice-cold Heineken.

          MAITRE D'
     One Heineken, certainly, sir.

Jeffrey surveys the place after the Maitre d' leaves.  It is very dark and
smoky inside.  He has trouble seeing, but suddenly he spots Frank sitting
with some other GUYS watching Dorothy sing.  They are sitting two tables
away.

Frank is totally captivated by Dorothy's singing and is very serious-
looking.  He looks right up to her eyes.  In his hand he works a small
piece of blue velvet cloth with his fingers.  Again her first number,
"BLUE MOON," segues into "BLUE VELVET."  This song she sings mainly to
Frank.  When it is over Frank continues watching Dorothy and everyone else
applauds loudly.

Jeffrey drinks up his Heineken and goes back outside.

EXT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT

He looks around at all the cars but none stand out as Frank's.  He gets
into his car and pulls out across the street, re-parks the car and waits.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

106. EXT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT

Traffic roars past Jeffrey and in the distance several people exit the
SLOW CLUB.  Among them are Frank and his friends.  They get into a black
Ford Fairlane and drive out of the parking lot - down the highway.
Jeffrey starts his engine and moves out after them.  He has to gun the car
up to sixty-five to catch up with them.

107. EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

The mysterious MUSIC plays.

He follows them to an intersection where they turn off to the right.
He waits at a light right behind them.  Inside they are lighting
cigarettes.  The light turns green and Frank takes off.  Jeffrey follows
them through a dark area down by the docks.  He follows them up a narrow
street through dark factories.

108. EXT. FRONT STREET - NIGHT

Dark, low MUSIC now.

Up ahead, Frank parks his car.  Jeffrey quickly pulls over and kills his
lights and engine.  He watches Frank and his friends enter an old apartment
building next to a bookbinding factory.  They disappear within.  The
electric lines above buzz loudly.

Jeffrey gets out of his car and walks up the deserted street.  He reaches
Frank's car which is making popping and clicking NOISES as it cools down.
He looks at the license plates - walks a few paces ahead and then writes it
down in his notebook.  He continues on to the apartment building.

109.      INT. LOBBY - FRANK'S BUILDING - NIGHT

Inside he looks at the names on the mailboxes.  He sees a name - Frank
Booth.  The name gives him the chills.  The apartment number is 26.

In the distance, he hears footsteps.  He quickly leaves.

110. EXT. FRONT STREET - NIGHT

. and crosses the street down to his car.  He gets in and waits.  Frank
comes out of the building and crosses to his car.

          JEFFREY
     (out loud to himself)
     I'll bet I know where you're going.

He follows Frank as he pulls out.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

111.      EXT. DINER PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Jeffrey discreetly parks just after Frank kills the engine on his car.
He watches Frank leave the parking lot.

112. EXT. VACANT FIELD - NIGHT

He follows Frank through the same vacant lot where he found the ear.  He
seems to use the lot as a secret short cut to Dorothy's apartment.


113. EXT. DINER PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Jeffrey goes back to his car to wait.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

114. EXT. DINER PARKING LOT - NIGHT

A storm is building.  There is a roar of thunder as Frank slams his car
door as he gets in.  His mouth twists into a smile as he guns the engine
and leaves.  Jeffrey waits till Frank is safely gone.

          JEFFREY
     (thinking out loud)
     I shouldn't go in. I shouldn't. but I'm
     too curious. and I have to try to help her.

He then gets out of his car as the wind is building.

115. EXT. VACANT FIELD - NIGHT

. and runs through the vacant lot.

116. EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

. to Dorothy's building.

117. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

He goes up to the seventh floor and knocks twice on 710.  A moment passes,
then the door flies open.

Dorothy looks as if she was expecting Frank to be coming back.  Dorothy
LOOKS BAD.

          JEFFREY
     Hi. can I come in?

          DOROTHY
     (looking around the hallway)
     Yeah. hurry up though.

They go inside.

118. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          JEFFREY
     Are you alright?

Dorothy breaks down crying.

          DOROTHY
     No. I'm not.

Jeffrey goes to her.

          DOROTHY
     Why are you here. whatiya want?


          JEFFREY
     . I. uh.

          DOROTHY
          (still crying)
     I looked for you in my closet tonight.
          (a little laugh)
     It's crazy, I don't know where you came
     from but. I like you.

          JEFFREY
     That's not crazy. I like you too.

Dorothy looks up.  They stare at each other for some time.

          DOROTHY
     I liked being with you last night.

          JEFFREY
     . same here.

There is a loud knocking on the door.

          DOROTHY
          (she starts to stagger)
     Oh shit.

          JEFFREY
          (frightened)
     Frank? .can you stand up?

          DOROTHY
     I'm alright. go hide. This won't
     take long. Be quiet.

Jeffrey gets in the closet and Dorothy closes the door.  She holds her
head collecting her fragile self.  Dorothy goes to the door and opens it.
It's the Man with the Yellow Sports Coat - tonight he's wearing a purple
sports coat and light blue double knit pants.  His eyes are glazed and his
face is broken out in a sweat.

          YELLOW MAN
     Frank gone?

          DOROTHY
     Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin'
     back.

          YELLOW MAN
     Bull.

          DOROTHY
     Alright, suit yourself.

          YELLOW MAN
     He's comin' back?. What for?

          DOROTHY
          (shaking)
     'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for.
     Frank's got you really loaded tonight.

          YELLOW MAN
          (getting upset)
     Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you.
     and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't
     it. remember that. Your husband was the
     one who started fucking my mind with drugs.

          DOROTHY
     Oh he forced you, huh?

          YELLOW MAN
     He's the reformed dealer though who wanted
     to turn himself in. he's the one that caused
     Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real
     good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to
     be here watching you why can't I be here
     fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the
     size of a pin - let me give you the real
     thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.

          DOROTHY
          (cool, but real mad)
     No way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank.
     I'm gonna tell him what you said.

          YELLOW MAN
     Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see. I'll get you.

Dorothy kicks the door after he closes it, then she chains it.  Jeffrey
comes out of the closet.

          JEFFREY
          (talking softly)
     Nice guy.  Who's he?

          DOROTHY
     Who's it, you mean.

SUDDENLY, Dorothy starts to shake and cry.

Jeffrey grabs her and shakes her and holds her tight to him.  She starts
sobbing again.

          DOROTHY
          (continuing)
     Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.

          JEFFREY
          (quietly, soothing her)
     There you go again. stop saying that.
     You can make it.

          DOROTHY
     I can't. I can't. You think you know
     so much.

          JEFFREY
     Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway?.
     Why are you in so much trouble?

Dorothy is sobbing and Jeffrey is holding her.  There is a long silence
and she calms down.

          DOROTHY
          (whispering)
     I. don't. okay. Just don't. just be
     with me.
          (now very strangely)
     Oh God. Come with me. Who are you.
     Come up here.

Dorothy takes Jeffrey through the kitchen and out the back.

119. INT. BACK STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

. to a back stairway leading to the roof.

120. EXT. ROOFTOP - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

The storm is closer and the dark clouds move violently in front of a full
moon.  The wind continues to moan.  They move to the roof top and Dorothy
leads Jeffrey through the chimneys to the edge of the building.  A very
sad forlorn version of "Somewhere over the Rainbow" - creeps through the
wind.

          DOROTHY
          (as she stares down)
     Look.

          JEFFREY
          (turning to her quickly)
     No.

          DOROTHY
     (continuing to look down, her
         eyes widening - she whispers)
Falling.

          JEFFREY
     No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so
     much trouble?

He moves closer to her.

          JEFFREY
          (continuing)
     Who is Don?

          DOROTHY
     (very crazy and angry)
     Don?. Are you in with them?

          JEFFREY
                            (whispering)
     No. But you're in very big trouble.

          DOROTHY
     Why are you so interested? Why do you
     keep asking me?


          JEFFREY
     I came back to help you. You said do I
     let girls sneak into my house. You know
     where I live. if you need to. come to
     where I live. O.K.?

          DOROTHY
     Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like
     me, huh?

          JEFFREY
     Yes.

          DOROTHY
          (whispering)
     . or do you just want me? I'm going to let
     you enter me now.

          JEFFREY
     No. I should go.

          DOROTHY
     Please. please stay.

She makes him kiss her. he really likes it.  Once again, Jeffrey and
Dorothy get VERY HOT.  Dorothy and Jeffrey lie down on the roof.  Dorothy
cries out suddenly and bangs her head hard again and again against the
roof.

          JEFFREY
     Why Dorothy?

We move very close to Jeffrey's ear as Dorothy's lips come up and whisper
into it.

          DOROTHY
     Don? I have to make it hurt. I want
     there to be nothing again. Don!!!
          (as she slams her head
             again and again)

She reaches up and clutches Jeffrey then pulls him down with a feverish
kiss.  Lightening cracks above them and the wind howls.

FADE TO WHITE:

FADE DOWN TO:

121. EXT. LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT

Jeffrey leaves the pool of light from a street light and walks into
darkness.  He continues down the sidewalk.  He looks up at the starry sky.
The stars are so far away - the feeling is cold and lonely.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

121A.

Darkness: There are bell tones sounding, and as each one sounds pin points
of light appear on Mr. Beaumonts distorted dream face.  He is trying to
speak.  He's trying to say "Jeffrey."

121B.

Another dark image appears.  A robin sits in a tree at night.  Very close.
There is a slow low reverberating chirping sound.

121C.

Now Dorothy's apartment building at night.  A very low angle looking up
to the roof.  Suddenly a pinpoint of red appears coming toward us from
the roof.  It flies toward us very fast growing larger until we see it is
a red high-heeled shoe.  As it fills the screen it becomes red lips of
Dorothy's which open into a scream.

121D.

Jeffrey wakes in his room - terrified.

122. INT. BEAUMONTS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Jeffrey is talking with Aunt Barbara in the semi-dark living room.

          JEFFREY
     Will you tell Mom when she gets home from
     the hospital that I've gone to dinner at
     Sandy Williams' house?

          AUNT BARBARA
     Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey.
     I think you've got termites in the house.

          JEFFREY
     Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?

          AUNT BARBARA
     I've seen a few.

          JEFFREY
     Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry
     about it. Look. I better go.

          AUNT BARBARA
     Okay honey.

Jeffrey leaves and Aunt Barbara moves about tapping on the walls.  She
moves into a dark area and taps.  Something falls.  She reaches down.

In EXTREME CLOSEUP we see a termite walking by her shoe on the thick
carpet.  Then in EXTREME CLOSEUP we see Aunt Barbara's fingers pinch the
termite and bring it up in front of her thick glasses for a look.  She
looks at the termite, then looks back at the walls.

We GLIDE ALONG the dark walls of the house.

                              CUT TO:

123. INT. WILLIAMS' DINING ROOM - NIGHT

They all sit around the dining room table.  They have their heads bowed
in a prayer before dinner.

          SANDY
     We thank you in the name of the Father, the
     Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

They start passing food around.

          MIKE
     Like I was saying. if you toss the ball like
     this, with your fingers just down here, that
     thing'll spin like a beauty. real straight.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
          (teasing him)
     Yeah? Then how come nobody caught anything
     last week?.

          MIKE
          (not laughing)
     'Cause we had a bad day.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     You play any sports, Jeffrey?

          JEFFREY
     No.

          MIKE
     Looks like you'd make a good runner.

          JEFFREY
     Well.

          MIKE
     I mean, you don't exactly have the build
     for a football. I mean. no offense.

Jeffrey looks around and sees Sandy looking at him.  She then gives a
stern look to Mike.  Then Mike and Sandy both look at Jeffrey.

          JEFFREY
          (not offended)
     No. you're right.

          MIKE
     I mean. some guys play anyway but they
     usually get slaughtered.

          JEFFREY
     Yeah, well I never wanted to get
     slaughtered much.

          MIKE
          (not getting any humor)
     Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the
     point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?

          MRS. WILLIAMS
     No, Mike. but there are vitamins in the
     food, you know.

Everyone laughs.

          MIKE
     Yeah, but I gotta supplement that. I gotta
     take a bunch of zinc too. The body is like
     a machine. EVERYTHING has got to stay in
     perfect tune for perfect health. That's
     what I'm interested in.

Sandy looks at Mike.

          MIKE
     Oh yeah. and a few other things.

Everyone laughs again.

          SANDY
     We've got some Heinekens.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     Yeah. I like Bud myself.

          SANDY
     I'll get it. Mike, whatiya want?

          MIKE
     I guess another glass of water.

Sandy and Jeffrey share a look.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

124. INT. WILLIAMS' BASEMENT - NIGHT

Mike and Sandy are sitting on a couch in the basement.  Jeffrey is sitting
on a chair nearby.  The television set is on.

          MRS. WILLIAMS
          (calling downstairs)
     Who wants dessert? It's blueberry pie. and
     ice cream.

Jeffrey and Sandy say "yes."

          MIKE
     None for me, thanks.

Jeffrey looks over at Sandy.  Mike sees this.  There is more tension
growing.

          MIKE
          (referring to T.V.)
     What are watchin' this junk for?

          SANDY
     You can change it if you want to.

          MIKE
     I don't know why we have to watch T.V.

          SANDY
     Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come
     on.

Mrs. Williams comes downstairs carrying a tray with dessert.

          MRS. WILLIAMS
     Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?

          JEFFREY
     That sounds great!

          MRS. WILLIAMS
     Anyone else?. Alright Jeffrey, just a
     minute.

Mrs. Williams goes back upstairs.  Jeffrey and Sandy start eating their
dessert.  Sandy watches Jeffrey happily wolf down his pie.  Mike stands up.

          MIKE
     I'll be right back.

He leaves as if he's going to go upstairs.  Once around the corner he
stops and listens to see what Jeffery and Sandy will say to one another.

          SANDY
     Well, how did it go?. What happened?

          JEFFREY
     Well. I've found out some things.
     nothing really for certain. There are some
     strange people involved.

          SANDY
     What did you see?

          JEFFREY
     Well.
     (looking around, feeling funny)
     Maybe we should discuss this somewhere
     else. you know what I mean?

Just then, Mrs. Williams starts down with the coffee for Jeffrey.
She sees Mike at the bottom of the stairs.  This seems strange to her.

          MRS. WILLIAMS
     Mike?. Are you alright?

Mike starts upstairs.

          MIKE
          (mumbling)
     Yes.

Downstairs, Jeffrey and Sandy hear that Mike was close by.  Mrs. Williams
and Mike pass on the stairs and Mrs. Williams enters the basement.  She
throws Sandy a concerned look.  Just then, Mike calls downstairs.


          MIKE
     Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?

          SANDY
          (calling up)
     Sure. just a sec.
          (to Jeffrey)
     Excuse me.

125. INT. WILLIAMS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Upstairs, Mike is by the front door.

          MIKE
     Come on out a minute, okay?

          SANDY
     Okay.

They leave.

125A. INT. WILLIAMS' BASEMENT - NIGHT

Downstairs Mrs. Williams picks up some dishes.

          MRS. WILLIAMS
     Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll
     get to the dishes.

          JEFFREY
     Sure thing. please don't worry about me.
     Can I help you with the dishes?

          MRS. WILLIAMS
     Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly
     not. just relax and enjoy your coffee.
     I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.

Detective Williams comes to the top of the stairs and calls down.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     Jeffrey?

          JEFFREY
     Yes?

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     If you want to come up a minute, I'll show
     you some pictures.

126. INT. DETECTIVE WILLIAMS' STUDY - NIGHT

Jeffrey enters Detective Williams' study.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
          (continuing)
     Take a look at these. These are the photos
     of the vacant lot where you found the ear.
     You might find them interesting.


Jeffrey begins going through the pictures.  They are 8 X 10 black and
white prints.  Mostly they are pictures of weeds, but they look quite
beautiful in an abstract way.  As he goes through them.

          JEFFREY
     These are beautiful. How's the case
     coming?

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     Okay.

          JEFFREY
     Anything you can tell me?

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     The criminals are winning.

          JEFFREY
     Is that why you say it's horrible?

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     Yes.

          JEFFREY
     I guess you've seen some bad things.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison
     your mind by telling you.

          JEFFREY
     Why do you do it?

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     I won't let the bastards get me up against
     the wall. It's an act of defiance.

          JEFFREY
     Yeah. I get it.

Suddenly Jeffrey sees something in the black and white photos.  A piece
of cloth in the grass.  Carefully he asks.

          JEFFREY
     What is this? What color is it?

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
          (leaning over to see)
     Blue. It's Blue Velvet.

Sandy comes into her father's study looking upset.  Detective Williams
puts the photos away.

          SANDY
     Can I use the car for a while?

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     Sure. What's up?

          SANDY
     I want to buy Jeffrey a Dairy Queen.

          JEFFREY
     A Dairy Queen?
          (he holds his stomach)
     Oh yeah? Sure, that sounds great.

                              CUT TO:

127. INT. WILLIAMS CAR/NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

Jeffrey gets in and Sandy starts the car.  She pulls out.  They drive away.

          JEFFREY
     What's with Mike?

          SANDY
     He got a little jealous.

          JEFFREY
     I'm sorry, I didn't.

          SANDY
     It's okay. Don't worry about it.

The car glides along.

Jeffrey and Sandy smile at one another.  They drive on.

          SANDY
     You want a Dairy Queen?

          JEFFREY
     No way. I'm about to blow up.

128. INT. WILLIAMS CAR/CHURCH - NIGHT

Sandy laughs as she pulls the car curbside in a quiet street by a church.
The church pipe-organ music drifts softly into the night.

          SANDY
     You want to tell me about it?

          JEFFREY
     . OK. It's a strange world, Sandy.
     this is what I have found out. What I
     think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens
     is married to a man named Don. they have
     a son. I think the son and the husband
     have been kidnapped by a man named
     Frank who has now cut off both of Don's
     ears. I think he is holding them to make
     her do things for him. I think she wants
     to die. the ears were for her a warning
     to stay alive. there is another man
     involved. I call him the "yellow man".
     you saw his back the other day in the hall
     at her door. I don't know what he does but
     I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank.
     Frank is a very dangerous man.

          SANDY
          (quietly)
     Wow. Should you tell my father?

          JEFFREY
     I don't see how I can. and I can't prove
     any of this. I got all this information
     illegally. also it could get you in
     trouble.

          SANDY
     You saw a lot in one night.

          JEFFREY
     . Actually. I've been in twice.

          SANDY
          (uneasy)
     Twice. without her sensing anything?

          JEFFREY
          (lying)
     Yes.

          SANDY
          (pausing)
     Did you see her undressed?

          JEFFREY
     Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.

          SANDY
     Yeah?

          JEFFREY
     (a searching, slight smile)
     That doesn't bother you, does it?

          SANDY
     Who, me? Why should it?

          JEFFREY
     (seeing some jealousy and
                      and happy for it)
     That's what I thought.

          SANDY
     You're sure right. It is a strange world.

          JEFFREY
     Why are there people like Frank. Why is
     there so much trouble in this world.?


          SANDY
     I don't know. I had a dream. in fact. the
     night I met you.
          (she reflects silently on
                         this before proceeding)
     . in the dream the world was dark because
     there weren't any robins. you know, birds.
     robins stood for love. and all of a sudden
     thousands of robins flew down and brought
     this blinding light of love. and it felt
     like that love would be the only thing that
     would make any difference. I guess. until
     the robins come there is trouble.

          JEFFREY
     Yeah I guess so.
     (he turns to her)
     You're a neat girl.

          SANDY
     So are you.
          (laughs)
     I mean you're a neat guy. We better
     get back.

          JEFFREY
     I guess so. you want to help me watch
     Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's
     place tomorrow. with a camera.

Sandy starts the car and pulls out into the street.  They begin driving
back.

129. INT. WILLIAMS CAR/NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

          SANDY
     No, silly - I'm still in school you know.
     but I'll meet you after school and you
     can tell me what you've learned. You better
     be careful, Jeffrey.

          JEFFREY
     I will.  I'll pick you up on the same
     corner at three thirty-five, okay?

They pull up in front of Jeffrey's house.

          SANDY
     Okay. be careful.

          JEFFREY
     Okay, Sandy.

130. EXT. BEAUMONTS' HOME - NIGHT

Jeffrey gets out of the car.  He goes around to her side and looks down
at her in the car.  She looks very beautiful.  He stands there for a
moment.

          JEFFREY
     Can I give you a kiss good night?

          SANDY
          (pauses, trembling)
     You better not, Jeffrey.

          JEFFREY
     Okay. okay.

          SANDY
     Goodnight.

          JEFFREY
     See ya tomorrow.

Sandy slowly drives off.  Jeffrey watches her go then turns and goes
inside his house.

131. INT. BEAUMONTS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The house is very dark and quiet.  Jeffrey finds a note by the one table
light is on.  The note is from his mother.  It reads, "Jeffrey hope you
enjoyed yourself. See you at breakfast. Love Mom."  A postscript is written
on the note by Aunt Barbara.  "Jeffrey, honey, I found these. Love, Aunt
Barbara."  Jeffrey sees that Aunt Barbara has left him two dead termites.
He picks one up and studies it.  Again we see a huge CLOSEUP of a termite
in the half-light.  Jeffrey shakes his head in amusement.

132. INT. JEFFREY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Jeffrey paces nervously.  He picks up the phone and mouthing the numbers
he dials Dorothy's number.  There is a "click" but no one speaks.
Jeffrey instinctively speaks.

          JEFFREY
     Hello?

          FRANK (telephone V.O.)
     Speak to me Fucker.

Jeffrey hangs up immediately.  He's scared.

          JEFFREY
          (to himself)
     Stupid!! So stupid. now she might be in
     even more trouble with Frank. I hope not.
     I hope not. tomorrow I have to find out
     more about Frank.

133. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/FRONT STREET - DAY

Jeffrey has a camera taped and rigged to the dashboard aimed at the front
door of Frank Booth's apartment building.  The camera is covered with a
cardboard shoe box.  Jeffrey is eating a sandwich which was
wrapped in wax paper and is waiting and watching.

A LADY steps out of the building and begins walking down the steps.
Jeffrey reaches over and removes the shoe box and quickly takes two
pictures.


We see a MAN walk down the street and turn up the steps.  Jeffrey shoots,
but really only gets the back of the man.

JEFFREY
     Damn!

He replaces the cardboard box and continues eating.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

134. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/FRONT STREET - DAY

Later in the day.  Jeffrey sits waiting.  He looks at his watch.  It says
2:00.

As he looks up he sees Frank getting out of a car with another man. the
Yellow Man.  They head for Frank's building.  Jeffrey hurriedly removes
the shoe box and begins snapping pictures.  They mount the steps and
disappear within the old dark structure.

          JEFFREY
     Wow.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

135. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/FRONT STREET - DAY

Jeffrey's watch - the hand - time lapses around to 3:00.

          JEFFREY
     (out loud to himself)
     Fifteen more minutes.

Just then, he sees movement and takes the box off the camera.  He starts
shooting as TWO MEN come out the door.  It is the Yellow Man and a man who
is very well dressed with wavy hair and a mustache.  He carries an
alligator-skin briefcase FRANK HAS DISAPPEARED.  Both are talking together
and now laughing.  Jeffrey takes five or six pictures and then tries to
cover the camera as they approach.  The box falls.  The Yellow Man looks,
but Jeffrey gets the box back in time and pretends to be looking in the
glove compartment.

The two men walk right by Jeffrey and get into the car behind his.
Jeffrey decides to follow them.  He waits a few seconds and starts off.

136. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

They drive through town.

137. FACTORY BUILDING - DAY

. to a large factory building, park and go up a flight of metal stairs on the side of the building.  Jeffrey steps into the shadows and watches them.  At a metal landing they stop.  He sees them standing on their tip toes in order to see something in the

distance.  The man with the alligator briefcase is laughing with the Yellow Man at what he sees.  He grips the Yellow Man on the shoulder.  Jeffrey cannot see what they see from his vintage point.  He looks at his watch. "3:25".

          JEFFREY
     You gotta wait for me Sandy. I'm on a real roll.

He quickly takes a picture of the two of them on the staircase.

138. EXT. ALLEY - DAY

. then he goes down an alley in the direction they were looking.  At the
end of the alley he turns left and stops short.

139. EXT. COLD STORAGE COMPANY - DAY

He sees a crowd of people, an ambulance, and two police cars.  He walks
closer.  Through the crowd he sees a broken window.  Hanging in the window
is a dead man.  Blood is dripping out of a huge wound to the head.

On the sidewalk in front of the building a woman is lying in shock.
Her legs have been brutally broken and are angled back toward her head
in horrible positions.  Jeffrey stands next to two black guys.  Suddenly
one of the police officers start pushing everyone away.  Jeffrey turns to
them.

          JEFFREY
     What happened?

          GUY #1
     He was blown away man. can't you see?

          GUY #2
     That cracker was the biggest dealer in
     this section of the city, brother. the
     police are going to find more drugs in
     there than you can believe. It's a
     speedball heaven in there.

          JEFFREY
     Oh yeah? What about the woman?

          GUY #1
     Probably just a whore he happened to be
     with at the time.

          JEFFREY
     Man oh brother.

          GUY #1
     This is the way the world is my man. take
     a good look.

Jeffrey takes a last look before checking his watch and hurrying off.

                              CUT TO:

140. EXT. CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Jeffrey drives up to the corner where Sandy is standing.  She is
frantically looking around.  Jeffrey stops for her.

          SANDY
     (looking beyond the car)
     GO ON!!!. GO!

Jeffrey looks around.  A big FOOTBALL PLAYER is running up to a chain
link fence across the street, but it's too late - Mike sees Jeffrey.
Everything stops for a moment.  Then, Mike runs off.

          SANDY
     Oh great.

141. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Sandy goes around and gets in the car.

          SANDY
          (continuing)
     You were late.

          JEFFREY
     I'm really sorry.

          SANDY
     What am I going to do?

          JEFFREY
     You want to go talk to him?

          SANDY
     Yeah, but. I don't think it's going to do
     much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to
     him later.

                              CUT TO:

142. INT. DINER - DAY

Jeffrey and Sandy are sitting in the diner in a different booth, but
having the same things as before.

          SANDY
     You know, that cheese is practically
     all chemicals.

          JEFFREY
     That's what makes it so good. You wanta
     hear what I saw today?

          SANDY
     Shoot.

          JEFFREY
     Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into
     Frank's building, laughing with Frank.
     Now. the only trouble is. what does this
     prove?

          SANDY
          (thinking)
     Nothing really, but it's interesting.
     they know each other. they seem to like
     each other.



          JEFFREY
     Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on
     drugs. I think Frank supplies him.

          SANDY
     Oh yeah?

          JEFFREY
     Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out.
     This time with a well-dressed man with an
     alligator briefcase. They drove down this
     factory building and stood on a staircase
     looking at something in the distance.
     Number three. now get this. In the distance
     was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death
     and a woman with her legs broken.

          SANDY
     Jeffrey!!

          JEFFREY
     Then these guys told me the police will
     find a huge amount of drugs inside the
     dead man's place.

          SANDY
     I can't believe what you are finding out.
     Are you going to continue with this. Are
     you going back to her apartment?

          JEFFREY
     Yeah.

          SANDY
     Jeffrey?. Why?

          JEFFREY
     I'm seeing something that was always hidden.
     I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning.
     and it's all secret.

          SANDY
     You like mysteries that much?

          JEFFREY
     Yeah. you're a mystery. I like you.
     very much.

Jeffrey stands up and moves to her side of the booth.  They stare at each
other.

          SANDY
     Oh yeah?

Jeffrey leans over and kisses her gently.  She pulls away.

          SANDY
     Don't. please, Jeffrey.

Jeffrey looks at her for a moment.

          JEFFREY
     You worry about me really?

          SANDY
     Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I
     worry. a lot. I got you into this.

                              CUT TO:

143. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Jeffrey winds his way up the staircase of Dorothy's apartment building.
He hesitates before crossing to Dorothy's door.  He knocks on the door and
Dorothy opens it.

          DOROTHY
     Come in.

          JEFFREY
     Hello.

144. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Dorothy closes the door.  She chains it.

They kiss.  The kiss gets hotter.  The feeling begins.

They move down the hall to the back bedroom.  They've never made love
there.  As they hurriedly undress Jeffrey sees the pointed child's hat
with the propeller.  He picks it up and spins the propeller.  It makes a
bit of music.  Dorothy shrieks as she lurches toward Jeffrey grabbing his
hand, stopping him from turning the tiny propeller.  She gains some
control of herself.  Jeffrey releases the hat into her hand.

          DOROTHY
     It used to make me laugh .but.

          JEFFREY
     I'm sorry .maybe I better go Dorothy.

          DOROTHY
     Yes. Frank-

          JEFFREY
     Frank is coming?

          DOROTHY
     No. how could he?. Don't go. You think
     I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.
          (crying)
     . don't hate me.

          JEFFREY
          (very nervous)
     I sure don't hate you.

          DOROTHY
     I'm not crazy.
          (thinking)
     I know the difference between right
     and wrong.

          JEFFREY
     That's good.

Jeffrey moves to get out of bed.

          DOROTHY
          (she poses)
     Do you like my body?

          JEFFREY
     Sure I do.

She moves closer to him, towards his back touching it with her tongue.
She gets down in a pose and holds it.

          DOROTHY
     I'm a statue. you can feel me.you
     can do anything you want.

Jeffrey's hands find her flesh and move about.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

Jeffrey and Dorothy are making love in her bed in almost total darkness.

          DOROTHY
          (dreamily)
     What do you want to do?

          JEFFREY
     I'm doing it.

          DOROTHY
     Are you a bad boy?

          JEFFREY
     Whatiya mean?

          DOROTHY
     Do you want to do bad things?
          (very dreamy)
     Anything. anything.

          JEFFREY
          (whispering hot)
     What do you want?

          DOROTHY
     I want you to hurt me.

          JEFFREY
     No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you.
     I want to help you. I think I know some of
     what is happening to you.
          (she doesn't react)
     . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son.
     Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do
     something Dorothy. go to the police.


          DOROTHY
     No police!!!.
     (pushing herself back against
     the headboard; then frantic)
     No police!!

Suddenly, Dorothy gets very odd.  She turns into a little girl.  She has
a frightening little girl smile.

          DOROTHY
     You like to open me. don't you?

          JEFFREY
     Yes.

          DOROTHY
          (thinking with a grin)
     What if I told Frank that you opened me?

For just one quiet moment we see the stairway to Dorothy's apartment.
It is empty.  Then back to Jeffrey and Dorothy.

          JEFFREY
     That wouldn't be too good, would it?

          DOROTHY
     Frank would open you.

          JEFFREY
     Okay. I know you've been scared. now you
     want to scare someone.

          DOROTHY
     (smiles very strangely)
     Does that scare you?

          JEFFREY
     Shut up.

          DOROTHY
     Beeeee careful.

          JEFFREY
          (scared and mad)
     Come on Dorothy.

          DOROTHY
     What if Frank came over here and found us?

The curtains in the kitchen bellow out with an eerie gust of wind.

          JEFFREY
     Look, snap out of it, will ya?

          DOROTHY
     Kiss me.

They kiss.



          DOROTHY
          (continuing)
     Do you love me?

          JEFFREY
     Do you love me?

          DOROTHY
     I asked first.

          JEFFREY
     Sometimes I think I do.

          DOROTHY
     And sometimes you think you don't?! Well,
     get away then!

She bolts up.

          JEFFREY
     Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For
     cryin' out loud!

          DOROTHY
     Just get outta my bed.

She hits out at Jeffrey and strikes him in the face.  Jeffrey struggles
with her to keep her from hitting him again but she breaks loose and slams
out at his face again.  He pushes back hard and her head actually hits the
wall.  She smiles through the pain.

          JEFFREY
     Oh God. are you alright.

She falls on him and smothers him with kisses.

          DOROTHY
     See. see how you hurt me? Now. Open
     me. enter me.

Jeffrey moves on top of her in the darkness.

We move very close to Jeffrey's ear as Dorothy's lips come up and whisper
into it.

          DOROTHY
     I love you Don with all my heart.

          JEFFREY
     No. it's not Don.

But he can't stop himself or her from making love.

          DOROTHY
     Come inside me. Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.
          (very frantic)
     Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.

The movement subsides.  There is silence in the room, except for breathing.

          JEFFREY
     I didn't mean to hurt you.

          DOROTHY
     Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.

          JEFFREY
     You. what?

          DOROTHY
     You put your disease in me. your semen.
     it's hot and full of disease.

          JEFFREY
     There's no disease, I can tell you.

          DOROTHY
     Men are crazy. then they put their
     craziness into me. then it makes me
     crazy. then they aren't so crazy for
     awhile. then they put their craziness
     in me again.
          (starts crying)
     . it's burning me. but I love you. I
     do, I do. Did you know that? Did you
     know that I love you?

          JEFFREY
          (very apprehensive)
     I'm glad you do.

          DOROTHY
     There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in
     so much darkness though with things moving.
     there is darkness sucking me. It's kissing
     me and darkness is entering me. in every
     hole. It's opening me to a death.

          JEFFREY
     Dorothy. no!

          DOROTHY
          (whispering)
     If I die, then they'll be free. It's
     getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's
     a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm
     then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it
     getting cold.

          JEFFREY
     You called me Jeffrey.

          DOROTHY
     I did. are you?

          JEFFREY
     Yes.

          DOROTHY
     Why are you here?
          (Jeffrey gets on top
             of her again)
     Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.

          JEFFREY
     No. not really.
     (they kiss - very hot)
     but also because I really want you
     to be alright.

Dorothy stops and looks at him - she holds his face.  She starts to cry.

          DOROTHY
     You do .you really do.

She continues holding his face - looking in his eyes crying openly.
he pulls him down to her.

          DOROTHY
     Jeffrey. Jeffrey. Jeffrey.

Jeffrey smiles.

          JEFFREY
     I guess I should go.

          DOROTHY
     I want you to stay with me.

          JEFFREY
     I think I better go.

146. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Later.  Jeffrey is dressed and Dorothy comes out of the bathroom in her
robe.  She is combing her hair.  One or two lights are on now.  She looks
at Jeffrey and smiles, brushes some of his hair back from his face.

          DOROTHY
     You're my special friend, aren't you?
          (whispers)
     I have you inside of me still.
          (big smile)
     It helps me. I need you.

Jeffrey doesn't know what to say.  He starts walking toward the door with
Dorothy beside him.

          JEFFREY
          (lying)
     I'll call you.

          DOROTHY
     Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?

          JEFFREY
     What?

          DOROTHY
     I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.

          JEFFREY
     You look beautiful to me.

She pats her hips.

          DOROTHY
     Right in here. fat, fat, fat.

Dorothy takes the chain off the door and opens it.  The hall is empty.
There is some noise on the stairs.  Suddenly, Frank and TWO FRIENDS of
his come into view on the stairway.

          JEFFREY
          (to Dorothy)
     Oh no.

          DOROTHY
     (her eyes glaze over -
                  she's gone again)
     No.
          (calling out to Frank)
     Hi baby.

          FRANK
     Who's this fuck?

          DOROTHY
     He's a friend. from the neighborhood.
     we were just talking.

          FRANK
          (to Jeffrey)
     From the neighborhood?
          (slowly)
     Shut the fuck up.
          (to Jeffrey)
     You like telephones? Huh?. You wanta go
     for a ride?

          JEFFREY
     No thanks.

          FRANK
     No thanks. what does that mean?

          JEFFREY
          (very carefully)
     I don't want to go.

          FRANK
     Go where?

          JEFFREY
     On a ride.

          FRANK
     A ride?. Hell, that's a good idea. okay,
     let's go. Hey, let's go.

Frank grabs Jeffrey and pulls him along.

          FRANK
     (continuing to Dorothy)
     Come on. We're goin' for a joy ride.

147. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Frank takes Jeffrey on a wide-eyed terror walk down the stairway.

                              CUT TO:

148. INT. FRANK'S CAR/CITY STREETS - NIGHT

Frank and Dorothy are in the front seat.  Jeffrey is sandwiched between
two very dirty strange guys in the back.  Frank is driving very fast and
very crazy.  Sitting next to him on the front seat is a police radio which
periodically blares out police reports.  At the lights, when they turn
green, Frank lays rubber.

          FRANK
     Where you wanna go? I know!. We gotta see
     Ben. We gotta, right?

          PAUL
          (laughing)
     Yeah. we gotta see Ben.

The car roars through a seedy street lined with bars and clubs.  Liquor
and sex shop signs glow in hot neon colors.  They are blurred visions
because of the speed of Frank's car.

Driving music plays.
Frank careens dangerously down various narrow streets, just barely making
turns.  The Ford bounces off several curbs.  Dorothy occasionally steals
a glance back at Jeffrey.  She squeals out loud - sometimes with glee,
mostly in fear.

Raymond and Paul laugh with Frank, yell out or light cigarettes.

149. EXT. "BARBARY COAST" - NIGHT

Frank finally gets to where he's going - a corner bar - and skids to a
hault.  They all pile out.  Frank grabs Jeffrey.

          FRANK
     Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine.
     Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.

          RAYMOND
     Okay Frank.

          FRANK
          (to Jeffrey)
     What kinda beer do you like?

          JEFFREY
          (just says it)
     Heineken.

          FRANK
     FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!

He grabs Jeffrey and pushes him into the bar.

150. INT. "BARBARY COAST" - NIGHT

Moving fast now, they go through this dark frightening place.  Frank has
Jeffrey by the neck forcing him faster.  In the back there is a black man
fondling a white girl near a doorway.

151. INT. BACK ROOM - "BARBARY COAST" - NIGHT

They go through the door to a back room.  A few naked girls are there near
beds with curtains around them.  One girl lies on her bed with dried vomit
around her head and pillow.  Suddenly Frank spots his friend Willard.
He runs toward him violently and grabs him by the throat.

          FRANK
     Hey shithead. that's the last time I get
     you high and watch you freak out -
     motherfucker you tore my coat and I lost
     my lucky piece of blue velvet, man.

152.      INT. DETECTIVE WILLIAMS' STUDY - NIGHT

FLASHBACK

to the black and white photo of a piece of cloth in the weeds in the
vacant lot.

          JEFFREY (V.O.)
     What color is it?

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS (V.O.)
     It's blue. blue velvet.

153.      INT. BACK ROOM - "BARBARY COAST" - NIGHT

          WILLARD
     Hey Frank I'm sorry buddy.

          FRANK

     When you least expect it.

          WILLARD
     Frank. please man.

          FRANK
     A big love letter.

Frank pushes him down on the bed with the dried vomit whore.  They leave
Willard.

154. INT. STAIRS AND LANDING - BEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

... and go up a flight of dirty wooden steps.  Frank bangs on a door at the
first landing.  Raymond joins him with a case of Pabst Blue Ribbon Beer.

          FRANK
     Hey Ben. OPEN UP. It's Frank.

A tall, slender man with a smoking jacket and a mustache opens the door.
It's BEN.  His voice is very horse from years of smoking.

          BEN
          (very gracious)
     Frank. Come in.

          FRANK
     Hey, I brought some friends. and some
     beer.

          BEN
     Fine. Welcome. Come sit down.

155. INT. BEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The apartment is very large.  All the furniture is over-stuffed.  In
the room there is a very much over-weight WOMAN dressed in black and a
greasy-looking COUPLE.  On the couch, a YOUNG WOMAN plays with a large
doll.

          FRANK
     (getting higher all the time)
     Suave. goddam are you suave, you fucker.

     Certainly Frank.
          (to the fat woman)
     Darling, get some glasses. We'll have
     some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?

Everyone kinds of mills around.  Paul sits down in a chair and starts
laughing at some private joke in his head.

          FRANK
     Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?

          BEN
     Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?

          BEN
     Darling, where are the glasses?. Oh.

The Big Lady brings the glasses in and sets them on the card table.
She looks worried.  She gives a helpless pleading look to Ben.

          FRANK
     Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?

          RAYMOND
     Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?

          FRANK
          (laughs loud)
     Cheers. Suave man. you're so fuckin'
     suave. WE LOVE BEN! Here's to Ben!.

Frank slaps Jeffrey in the face.

          FRANK
     Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.

          JEFFREY
     (stunned, grabbing his face)
     Here's to Ben.

          FRANK
     Do you see, Ben?. I can make him do
     anything I fuckin' please.

Ben goes to Jeffrey.

          BEN
     Thank you neighbor. let me see your
     face. did he hurt you?

Jeffrey shows him.

          BEN
          (continuing)
     Oh. my.

Suddenly Ben slugs Jeffrey in the stomach.  Jeffrey doubles over.

          BEN
          (continuing again)
     Is that any better?

Frank almost dies laughing.  Everyone else joins in.  Ben turns to Frank.

          BEN
     Frank, I have something for you. Excuse
     us everyone.

          FRANK
     EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see
     her kid.

As Jeffrey tries to catch his breath, he sees tremendous emotion fill
Dorothy's face.  She rushes forward.  Raymond grabs her by the arm and
takes her into another room.  Jeffrey hears her crying out.  He hears a
small boy.

          DOROTHY (V.O.)
     Donny, oh my Donny.

          DONNY (V.O.)
     Mommy!

155A. INT. BACK ROOM - BEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Dorothy is sobbing and clinging to Donny.  He is crying and gripping her
like a small monkey would grip its mother.  Suddenly Donny breaks away,
screaming.

DONNY
     Mommy. You left me. you stopped loving me.

          FRANK
     (coming back into Ben's living room)
     Okay. let's hit the fuckin' road. we're
     givin' our neighbor a joy ride. let's get
     on with it. Bye, Ben. Ya wanna go on a
     joy ride with us, anyone? You?
          (looking around)

Dorothy rejoins the group.  She's in a state of shock.  Frank pinches her
cheek.

          FRANK
          (continuing)
     No smile for Frank? No? Okay, fuck it.
     Let's go. Oh you wanna come with Raymond?

Raymond has picked up the greasy girl.

          BEN
     See you Tuesday, Frank.

          FRANK
     Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck
     anything that moves.

They leave and pile back into the car.

157. INT. FRANK'S CAR/CITY STREETS - NIGHT

Girl.  They speed on into the night.  Frank drives through various dark
streets.

158. INT. FRANK'S CAR/HIGHWAY - NIGHT

. then out onto a highway and goes over 100 mph down a two-lane highway.

          FRANK
          (to Jeffrey)
     Hey? . You like to walk.

          JEFFREY
     What?

          FRANK
     Let's take our neighbor out. Let him
     fuckin' walk back.
          (laughs)

As Frank is driving Jeffrey sees Dorothy nervously look at the road and
surrounding countryside, then questioningly at Frank.  She senses something
about where they are going.

          DOROTHY
     Where are we going, Frank?

          FRANK
     Hey. Tits. I'm taking your neighbor to
     the country. maybe something for you too.

          DOROTHY
          (very anxious)
     Frank?

          FRANK
     You want to see him too, right?

          DOROTHY
     Yes, but.

          FRANK
     Then, shut up!

Frank sees Dorothy look back at Jeffrey.


          FRANK
          (continuing)
     Hey. What's this fuck got to do with
     anything.

159. INT. FRANK'S CAR/DIRT ROAD - NIGHT

Frank angrily swerves the car off onto a small dirt road bouncing down
it, screeching to a halt near an orchard of trees.  He turns violently
around to Jeffrey.

          FRANK
     What are you lookin' at?

          JEFFREY
     Nothing.

          FRANK
     (locks eyes with Jeffrey;
                long pause)
     Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see
     the whites of the eyes.
          (takes helium)
     You like me?.

Jeffrey is quiet.

          FRANK
          (still high voice)
     Look at these. What are these?

          DOROTHY
     Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.

Frank is doing something to Dorothy's chest but Jeffrey can't see.

          FRANK
     Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE
     THESE?

          DOROTHY
     Those are my breasts.

          FRANK
     Can I feel 'em?

          DOROTHY
     If you want to.

Frank takes helium.

          FRANK
     Baby wants to pinch 'em.

She winces and tries to pull away.

          FRANK
          (continuing)
     What's the matter? Give 'em back. They're
     just a little red, that's all. let me feel
     'em again. Come here.

Frank pulls her over and starts to pinch her again.  It really hurts her
and she is frightened and in pain.

          JEFFREY
     Hey. leave her alone.

Frank pretends not to hear Jeffrey and pinches Dorothy's breasts real hard.
She stifles a scream.  Jeffrey gets mad.  He hits Frank hard in the face.
Everyone is deadly silent as Frank turns to Jeffrey.  Frank stares at
Jeffrey.

          FRANK
     NEXT! . out of the car fuck. HELP HIM
     OUT, RAYMOND!!

160. EXT. FRANK'S CAR/DIRT ROAD - NIGHT

Frank gets out and presses his face against the rear window.  His distorted
face is hideous.  He opens the back door.  Raymond and Paul grab Jeffrey
and pull him out of the car.  The Greasy Girl laughs nervously.

          DOROTHY
     Frank. he didn't mean it. Leave him
     alone. come on. He didn't mean it.

          FRANK
     Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.
          (takes gas)
     . Hey, pretty, pretty.

Dorothy doesn't move fast enough so Frank dumps her whole purse out on the
front seat and grabs the lipstick and a flashlight.  He puts lipstick
heavy onto his lips.

While Raymond and Paul hold Jeffrey.  Frank kisses Jeffrey all over the
mouth.  Jeffrey tries to hit Frank and pull away, but Raymond and Paul
have a hold of him.  Jeffrey looks very strange with these big blotches
of red lipstick on his face and mouth.

          DOROTHY
     LEAVE HIM ALONE!! FRANK!!

Frank slams the front door shut to muffle Dorothy.  He grabs Jeffrey and
presses his frightened face against the front window.  Then, the back
window.  Then, he flops Jeffrey up on the hood with Paul's help and presses
Jeffrey's face against the rear window.  Inside the car, this show is
crazy and scary.  Then, Frank takes Jeffrey over to the side of the car
again.

          FRANK
          (to Jeffrey)
     You're fuckin' lucky to be alive.
     LOOK AT ME!

Raymond pulls Jeffrey's face back so he's looking at Frank.  Dorothy and
the Greasy Girl watch in terror.



          FRANK
     Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm
     gonna send you a love letter. straight
     from my heart, fucker. You know what a
     love letter is? It's a bullet. straight
     from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love
     letter from me, you're fucked forever.
     Understand, Fuck?

          JEFFREY
     Yes.

          FRANK
     I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!

Frank takes a small square of blue velvet out of his pocket and begins
feeling Jeffrey's face with it.

          FRANK
     (continuing; breathing heavily)
     You feel good. feel my muscles.

Raymond makes Jeffrey raise his arm and Jeffrey feels Frank's biceps.

          FRANK
          (continuing)
     You like that?
                     (to Raymond and Paul)
     Hold him tight for me.

Suddenly Frank starts hitting Jeffrey in the face.  Dorothy screams at the
car window.

CUT TO BLACK:

161.      EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

NO SOUND. THEN A MOAN.

JEFFREY'S P.O.V. of rocks on the ground.

He slowly picks up and looks around.  The car is gone.  He is swollen,
bloody, and covered with lipstick.  His pants have been pulled down and
"FUCK YOU" has been written with lipstick on his legs.

He struggles to his feet and pulls his pants up.  He fastens his belt
and begins limping up the dirt road highway.

          AUNT BARBARA

          JEFFREY
     (interrupting, smiling
                         at Aunt Barbara)

Jeffrey climbs the stairs up to Detective Williams' office.

174. INT. ROOM 221 - POLICE STATION - DAY

He rounds the corner and steps inside the office, when he stops short with
fear.  Detective Williams is not there, but sitting at a desk next to
Detective Williams' desk is the Yellow Man.  Their eyes lock.

Jeffrey freezes.

          JEFFREY
     Excuse me.

Jeffrey turns away as quickly as possible and goes over to a water cooler
and gets a drink, keeping his back to the Yellow Man.  He shakes with
fear.  He slowly turns around.  The Yellow Man is studying some papers on
his desk.

Again the Yellow Man looks up.  This time he is slightly suspicious and he
cooks his head.  Jeffrey cannot move.

Finally, Jeffrey is able to step away.  As he leaves the Yellow Man's line
of sight, Jeffrey catches the names on the door.

179. EXT. WILLIAMS HOME - NIGHT

Jeffrey walks through the darkness, carrying the photos.  He stops in
front of Detective Williams' house and hesitates.  Jeffrey's face has a
troubled look.  He approaches the front door.

He hesitates again before finally knocking.  Detective Williams answers
the door.  Sandy is in the background.  When she sees the look on Jeffrey's
face, she knows why he's there.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     Jeffrey! Come on in.

          JEFFREY
     Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you,
     but I've got to talk to you.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a
     bad face lift.

          JEFFREY
     (with a goofy smile to Sandy)
     Yeah.

180. INT. WILLIAMS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Sandy gives him a concerned look.  Jeffrey follows Detective Williams to
his study.

181. INT. DETECTIVE WILLIAMS STUDY - NIGHT

He closes the door behind him.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     Okay?

          JEFFREY
     Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered
     some things. .Anyway I have to show you
     some pictures and tell you some things
     about them. The first picture is this.

He shows him the picture of Frank and studies Detective Williams' face as
he sees it.



          JEFFREY
          (continuing)
     This is Frank Booth. His address is on
     the back of the photo. He, in my opinion,
     is very sick and dangerous. This photo
     here is of Frank with another man as they
     went into Frank's apartment.

Jeffrey casually hands the photo over and watches Detective Williams' face
extra carefully.  Detective Williams doesn't flinch, yet his eyes slowly
glide upwards to meet Jeffrey's.

          JEFFREY
          (continuing)
     And that man came out with a third man -
     this well-dressed guy. here's the photo.
     I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is
     in trouble with these people. I think
     Frank has taken her husband and her son.

          JEFFREY
          (continuing)
     I have no hard proof of any of this. Her
     address is also on the photos. I think
     these people are involved with drugs. and
     murder. I think Frank is killing drug
     dealers and.
     (he decides not to tell Detective
            Williams everything)
     . and somehow Frank is getting all their
     drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly
     more involved in this than you wanted me
     to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to
     tell you about these things in case it
     could help.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get
     so involved?

          JEFFREY
     I can't tell you the whole story. I. I
     took it upon myself. I can't say more.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     Is Sandy part of this?

          JEFFREY
     No. not at all.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
          (referring to the photos)
     Who knows you have these?

          JEFFREY
     Only you. and the photo lab.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     You're all through with this now?


          JEFFREY
     Yes sir. I sure am.

Detective Williams studies Jeffrey, then the photos.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     For now. Alright. you better be. And
     Sandy better not be involved with this,
     I can tell you. Be prepared to come in
     for further interrogation on this later.

          JEFFREY
     Yes sir.

Jeffrey leaves the study.

182. INT. WILLIAMS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

In the living room, Jeffrey looks at Sandy.

          SANDY
     Everything okay?

          JEFFREY
     Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him
     some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?

          SANDY
     You didn't tell him about me?

          JEFFREY
     No.

Detective Williams comes out of his study and sees the two of them talking.
He sees some nervousness.  Sandy quickly changes the subject.

          SANDY
     I should never had gotten you going on this.
          (changing, smiling)
     Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!

Jeffrey is driving over to Sandy's.

He has to park across the street because a police car is sitting in front
of the Williams' house.  Its lights are slowly revolving on top. The engine
idles. a Man is inside. his head down, studying some papers.

Jeffrey barely notices all this, as he heads for the door.

Mrs. Williams answers the door and Sandy is behind her in the dining room.

          MRS. WILLIAMS
     Hello, Jeffrey. Come in.

187. INT. WILLIAMS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Jeffrey enters and crosses the room to Sandy.

          JEFFREY
     You all set?

Detective Williams comes in arranging some papers which he begins placing
in a briefcase on the dining room table.  Just then a man comes up to the
door which is still open.  Jeffrey turns to see.  It is Detective
T.R. Gordon, the Yellow Man.  All the color instantly drains from
Jeffrey's face.

          YELLOW MAN
          (yelling inside)
     Hey John - get a move on!!

Detective Williams turns.  He sees Detective Gordon.  He turns again.  He
sees Jeffrey's expression.  Sandy hasn't seen it yet.

Detective Williams goes to Jeffrey.  He looks him straight in the eye.  He
also positions himself between Jeffrey and T.R. Gordon.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     Easy does it Jeffrey. Behave yourself.
     don't blow it.

Sandy becomes curious and moves over to Jeffrey and her father.  Jeffrey
decides to trust Detective Williams.  The Yellow Man (T.R. Gordon) yells
again.

          YELLOW MAN
     Come on John, get it in gear pal!

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     So long Jeffrey. You two have a nice
     night, okay?


          JEFFREY
     Okay.

          SANDY
     What is it?

          JEFFREY
     Just some fatherly advice.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     That's right.

Jeffrey and Sandy head for the door.  The Yellow Man's and Jeffrey's eyes
meet once more.  The Yellow Man cocks his head. thinking.  No recognition.

          SANDY
          (to her mother)
     Goodnight mom.
     (to the Yellow Man)
     Goodnight Tom.

          T.R. GORDON-YELLOW MAN
     Goodnight, Sandy.

188. EXT. WILLIAMS HOME - NIGHT

They cross the yard to the car.  Jeffrey helps Sandy in, then goes around
and gets in himself.  They are both dressed very nicely.

Jeffrey starts the car and pulls out.

          SANDY
     What was that all about?

          JEFFREY
     Nothing. really! It's good to see you.

          SANDY
     It's good to see you.

          JEFFREY
     Where to?

          SANDY
     Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista.
     It's not far. Can you tell me any more
     about what you learned?

          JEFFREY
     I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell
     you about it sometime.

          SANDY
     It's okay.

          JEFFREY
     ... You look beautiful.

          SANDY
     Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the
     evening?

          JEFFREY
     I like that idea. that's a real good idea.

                              CUT TO:

190. INT. PARTY BASEMENT - NIGHT

Jeffrey and Sandy go downstairs to a basement which is dark and crowded
with kids dancing and talking.  Jeffrey and Sandy are holding hands.
Jeffrey feels a little out of place.

A COUPLE OF GIRLS raise their eyebrows and give approving looks to Sandy.
The music is loud, fast dancing music.

          SANDY
     You want to dance?

          JEFFREY
     I can't dance fast.

          SANDY
     Really?

          JEFFREY
     Really. you want to dance with someone
     else?

          SANDY
     NO.

          JEFFREY
     Let's wait for some slow one.

          SANDY
     Just a minute.

Sandy leaves Jeffrey for a moment and Jeffrey watches her make her way
through the crowd to a GIRL by the record player.  Sandy confers with the
girl.  Sandy comes back to Jeffrey.

          SANDY
     Don't worry. I took care of it. You
     want something to drink?

Just then, the music goes slow.

          JEFFREY
     You want to dance?

          SANDY
     Okay.

They begin to dance.  At first, further apart, then, they make the mistake
of looking in each other's eyes and they move very close together.
They move around to another look.  Then they kiss.  They kiss for the
entire rest of the song.  Between songs and during the entire next song.
They finally, as they say, come up for air.

          SANDY
     I love you, Jeffrey.

They kiss again.  Then they dance and look at each other.  Then they hug
each other.  As they hug, Jeffrey closes his eyes.

          JEFFREY
          (inner voice)
     I really do love you.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

191. INT. PARTY BASEMENT - NIGHT

Later.  Jeffrey gives Sandy a little kiss while they're over by the cokes.  They're having a drink.  Sandy introduces Jeffrey to some of her friends.  She is very proud of him.  They are both very happy.  They look at each other and kiss again.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

193. INT./EXT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT

Later.  The party is breaking up.  Kids are beginning to go upstairs and go out the front doors to their cars.  Jeffrey and Sandy are coming up stairs arm in arm.  They say goodnight to the PARENTS in the living room and leave through the front door.  The

y can't take their eyes off one another.  They are totally oblivious to the THREE GUYS in a car across the street.

As soon as Jeffrey gets Sandy and himself in his car, he starts it and moves off.

194. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - NIGHT

The dark car comes to life with a loud low roar and peels out with a
scream.  It follows Jeffrey and Sandy for a way, then it roars up behind
them swaying back and forth, honking its horn and trying to ram Jeffrey's
car in the rear.

Jeffrey looks frantically in the rear view mirror.  Sandy turns around in
fear.  Jeffrey guns his car and races down the street.

          SANDY
     Oh my God. What's wrong?

          JEFFREY
     Frank!!

He swerves around the corner.  Up ahead, a car is pulling out of a
driveway.

          JEFFREY
                     (continuing; referring
                      to the car ahead)
     Come on. MOVE IT!

Jeffrey swings hard around another corner and heads up a dark street,
passing "Lincoln St."

          JEFFREY
     I can't outrun this guy.

He floors the car and flies down another street very fast.

          JEFFREY
     My father has a gun at home.

          SANDY
     No.

          JEFFREY
     Sandy. this guy is a killer!! I promise
     you.

Sandy turns back to take a look.  Jeffrey swerves the car again; he bangs
it off a curb as he rounds a corner.  A hub cap goes flying off rolling
noisily down the street.

          SANDY
     Try to get to my house. then my father
     can.

CLOSEUP ON JEFFREY

195. INT. WILLIAMS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

He remembers Detective Gordon, the Yellow Man, at Sandy's house.

196. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - NIGHT

          JEFFREY
     No!!

Jeffrey floors the car again. but the car behind him is fast and gains
on him.  It swerves back and forth in the rear view mirror.  Now it
swerves and roars up alongside Jeffrey's car.  Sandy screams.

          SANDY
     It's Mike! It's Mike!

Jeffrey looks over.  It is Mike.  Out of enormous sense of relief he
starts laughing.  He slows instantly and so does Mike.

197. EXT. BEAUMONTS' HOME - NIGHT

He pulls slowly up in front of his house, his head back laughing.  Mike
swerves his car in front of Jeffrey's and jumps out.

          MIKE
          (out of the car; very drunk)
     Hey come here, you stole my girl, you
     bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right
     in front of your stupid house.

          SANDY
     ... Stop it Mike.


          MIKE
                           (to Sandy)
     You shut up. nobody's talkin' to you.
     Hey who's that Jeffrey? Your mother?

Everyone turns and looks.  Slowly out of the darkness comes a nude woman.  It is Dorothy.  She is totally in shock, bloody saliva is dripping from her mouth.  She is bloody, swollen and bruised all over.  She is totally different, drained of her sexuality

.  She has been ravaged.

          JEFFREY
     Dorothy! ... Dorothy!

          SANDY
     Dorothy Vallens?

          JEFFREY
     Yes.

He jumps out of the car, gets a hold of her and helps her back.  Mike
comes after him.

          MIKE
                        (going for Jeffrey)
     Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!

          JEFFREY
                       (pushing Mike off)
     Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone
     who's hurt here, in case you haven't
     noticed.

          SANDY
     Mike, go home.

Mike's friends are dazed, watching Dorothy staggering beside Jeffrey.
Mike steps back as Jeffrey puts Dorothy in the car.  Jeffrey stands back
up and glances at Mike.

          MIKE
                       (dull, very drunk)
     Hey, I'm sorry. Hey.

Jeffrey gets into the car.

          JEFFREY
     Yeah. okay, Mike.

Jeffrey shuts the door.  Dorothy is sandwiched between him and Sandy in
the front seat.

          SANDY
     Take her to my house. My dad can get an
     ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have
     anything to put around her?

          JEFFREY
               (starts the car)
     No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at
     your house?

          SANDY
     Probably not. no. Why?

          JEFFREY
     OK. Let's get her over to your father's.

          SANDY
                   (looking quickly from
                    Dorothy to Jeffrey)
     Right. Watch out for Mike, there.

Mike and his friends are getting in Mike's car.  Mike is trying to start
the engine.  He does and clumsily throws the car in reverse.  He screeches
out and screeches to a stop.  Then he guns away forward and shoots crazily
down the road.

          JEFFREY
     Here we go.

They drive off.

198. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

          DOROTHY
          (looking over)
     Oh God. Jeffrey is that you?

          JEFFREY
     Yeah, it's me.

          DOROTHY
     Oh God, Jeffrey. is that you? Oh God.

Sandy is confused. how do they know each other?

          MRS. WILLIAMS
          (shocked at sight)
     No.

          SANDY
     You better call him and get an ambulance
     too.

Dorothy is clinging to Jeffrey.  Mrs. Williams goes to call.

Sandy moves closer.  Jeffrey looks at Sandy and she returns the look.

          DOROTHY
          (crazy)
     Where have you been?
          (screams)
     Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey,
     Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME.
     Oh God.

          JEFFREY
     It's okay. it's okay.

          DOROTHY
                        (like a little girl)
     My secret lover.

Mrs. Williams comes in.

          MRS. WILLIAMS
     The ambulance will be here in a minute.
     I left word for John. The police are on
     their way.

          DOROTHY
                             (screams)
     Don't get the police. Oh God, ...Jeffrey
     I CAN'T STAND IT!! STOP IT. STOP IT.
     LOVE ME,

She looks up at Mrs. Williams.

          DOROTHY
                            (continuing)
     I opened myself to him. He put his
     disease in me.

She presses herself tight to Jeffrey.

          DOROTHY
                            (continuing)
     Tell me its okay. I opened myself to
     you. Okay, okay, okay, okay?

Mrs. Williams watches with confusion and worry for the hurt this is
causing Sandy.  Sandy is crying now and turns away.

          JEFFREY
     Sandy? ...Sandy, please.

          MRS. WILLIAMS
     I'll get a coat for her.

She leaves the room hurriedly.

          SANDY
          (crying)
     Jeffrey? .What's going on?


          JEFFREY
     Shh. I'll tell you.

          DOROTHY
          (quietly)
     They hurt his head.

          JEFFREY
     Who, Dorothy?

          DOROTHY

The SCREAMS DISSOLVE INTO a SIREN as it roars to a stop in front of the
Williams' house.

Sandy is still crying, while she moves back and watches Jeffrey.  Jeffrey
turns to look at Sandy.

          SANDY
          (crying)
     I still love you Jeffrey.

Mrs. Williams comes to put a coat around Dorothy.  Mrs. Williams is

          SANDY
     Go ahead.

          JEFFREY

     Don?. Where is he?

          DOROTHY
     (straining her eyes to
                      focus on Jeffrey)
     HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!

          JEFFREY
     I promise, Dorothy. I promise.

          DOROTHY
     Hold me. I'M FALLING!

Jeffrey arrives at Dorothy's apartment building and pays the driver.
He gets out of the cab and looks around.  No police.  Quiet.  The
building looks just the same standing there in the dark.  The dim lights
in the front entrance.  Jeffrey moves up to the front doors and enters.
No one.

                              CUT TO:

     No. he only wants my father to come over.
     It's very important. he said someone was
     hurt and he wants Detective Williams there.
     well, find him!!

210. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Jeffrey slowly climbs the stairs.  His shoes squashing the carpet make
mall crushing sounds as he climbs higher into the building.

He arrives at the Seventh Floor and stops.  A high-pitched whine can be
heard faintly.  It gets louder as Jeffrey crosses to Dorothy's apartment
door.  He gets his key out and inserts it.  Turns it.  With a loud click
the door swings open and the high whine becomes piercing.  He sees
something and jumps back.

211. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

It is Detective Gordon, the Yellow Man, standing in the center of the room.

FLASHBACK

He plays the look into the apartment again in his mind and again.

CLOSER ON DETECTIVE GORDON

Something is wrong with him.  He is bleeding from the head.  He stands
almost motionless. in shock.

Jeffrey peers into the room again.  He enters carefully and lets the door
close behind him.  He very cautiously moves forward into the room.  Slowly
he moves closer to a hideous sight.  Standing in the middle of Dorothy's
apartment is T.R. Gordon, the Yellow Man.  He is in an extreme state of
shock.  He is bleeding badly from a huge wound at the top left of his head.  His eyes focused on something only his twisted inner mind see.  Sitting in one of Dorothy's chairs is a dead man with no ears. only half-healed bloody wounds at each side of his

head.  A bullet hole in the center of his forehead.  The T.V. is crushed in but it is turned on and it is the television that produces the high electrical whine.  Jeffrey moves forward again and kicks the television cord out of the wall.  The high whine s

tops instantly.  Silence except for the Yellow Man's labored breathing.

Suddenly there is a loud "radio voice" coming from the Yellow Man's police
radio which is turned "on" in his jacket pocket.  Jeffrey's heart leaps
and just as suddenly the Yellow Man throws his arms out wildly knocking a
floor lamp to the ground and crushing out its light.  Jeffrey's heart goes
wild at this sight and he jumps back but the Yellow Man is silent and
motionless again.  The radio talks again.

          RADIO VOICE #1
     Get back and stay down.

          RADIO VOICE #2
     . It's apartment eight.

Music. LOVE LETTERS STRAIGHT FROM MY HEART. begins to play.
Jeffrey watches the Yellow Man and listens to the radio.

          RADIO VOICE #2
          (continuing)
     I'm sending Jack and Pete to the roof.
     It's.

          RADIO VOICE #1
     Hey.

Sounds of shots.

          RADIO VOICE #1
          (continuing)
     He's shooting. from the second window.

          RADIO VOICE #3
     Stay in place.

          RADIO VOICE #2
     Jack. get up there quick. can return
     fire?.

          RADIO VOICE #3
     I think he's alone. but return fire to
     second window only.

Many shots.

We see Jeffrey's face in CLOSEUP.

                              CUT TO:

212. EXT. FRONT STREET - NIGHT

The real scene is before us.  Police cars line the street along with a
huge fire truck and several ambulances.  Special police marksmen are
crouched behind cars and behind a stone wall opposite Frank's building.
Screams are heard from within and police radios blare.  Shots are being
fired into a black window.  Once in a while a shot is returned.  Two
policeman are dead and one is being loaded onto an ambulance.

          POLICEMAN #1
     He hasn't fired a shot for six minutes.
     maybe we got him. get on the radio. get
     Detective Williams. ask him if we can
     rush the son of a bitch.

A policeman runs off. more shots are fired into the building but none
are returned.  The policeman comes running back.

          POLICEMAN #2
     It's in the works already. we're in
     there. they're goin' down the back stairs
     now. It won't be long. and they'll have
     us rush 'em from here. one whistle and
     we go.

Suddenly there is a long barrage of gunfire into Frank's apartment.
Then a loud whistle.

          POLICEMAN #1
     That's it. let's go.

Police race across the street to Frank's building.

213. INT. FRANK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Police kick the door in and rush into the apartment.  It's empty excpt for
a large dog which has been shot.  The dog growls and cowers back in a
corner.  Every now and then it limps on bloody legs back and forth.

214. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jeffrey hears the radio.  He hears the policemen talking at Frank's place.  He hears that Frank is gone.  He decides to leave Dorothy's apartment.

          JEFFREY
     (speaking to T.R. Gordon who doesn't
     hear him because he's almost dead)
     I'm leaving now. I'll let them find you
     all on their own. find all this horror
     on their own.
          (whispers)
     Good bye.

He goes out and closes the door.

215. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

The door clicks shut.  He makes his way quietly down the hall to the
stairway. thinking.  He starts down the stairs.

          JEFFREY
     So. Frank escaped.

He rounds the corner on a landing on the stairway and goes down another
floor. and another.  At the next landing, something out the window catches
his eye.  He notices a man get out of the car.  He recognizes the man.
It is the well-dressed man he saw with the alligator briefcase.  Jeffrey
watches the man come toward Dorothy's building.  Then his eye goes back
to the man's car.  It is Frank's car.  He notices the man is carrying a
police radio.

          JEFFREY
          (to himself)
     Frank's car. Is this man a cop? He has a
     radio!. So did Frank though and he's no
     cop. that's for sure. and he's driving
     Frank's car. who is he?

The man enters the building at the front entrance directly below Jeffrey.

Jeffrey starts climbing back up the stairs. thinking faster.

          JEFFREY
     What happened that day?.

Jeffrey runs like mad up to Dorothy's apartment.  He looks back once and
sees the well-dressed man hurrying up the stairs.

CLOSEUP on well-dressed man's face. It is Frank, underneath a very good
disguise.

Jeffrey has trouble getting the key out of his pocket.  He fumbles with it
and it drops to the floor.

Frank climbs the stairs.

Finally the key goes in and Jeffrey frantically opens the door.  He rushes
into the room.

220. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The horror and strangeness of the scene within strikes him again.  He
rushes to the Yellow Man and takes the police radio out of his pocket.
He runs into the back of the apartment - to the back bedroom where he
crouches down behind a double bed.

          JEFFREY
          (into the radio)
     Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
          (over radio)
     Detective Williams here. Is that you,
     Jeffrey?

          JEFFREY
     Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up
     to Dorothy's apartment.
     (thinks; hits himself in the
                              forehead; inner voice)
                        Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing
                        everything we say!!
     (thinks some more - fast)
     Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the
     apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back
     bedroom.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     We're ten minutes away and moving as fast
     as we can.

221. EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

Sandy runs frantically down a dark street.  We see a street sign which
says "Lincoln."

222. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jeffrey drops the radio under the bed and runs back to the living room.
He leaps safely into the closet just as Frank opens the apartment door and
enters.  Jeffrey freezes with fear in the darkness of the closet.  Frank
is smiling.

          FRANK
     (calling pleasantly in the direction
  of the back bedroom)
     Hey neighbor. shit for brains. You forgot
     I have a police radio. I know where your
     cute little butt is hiding. Here I come!
     Ready or not!

He starts down the hall to the back bedroom.  The police radio which
Jeffrey planted under the bed and Frank's radio both start broadcasting.
Frank turns his radio off - now only the one under the bed plays.

          FRANK
     Hey fuck. I can hear you radio! .Hey
     you stupid fuck. you got about a
     second to live.

Jeffrey watches Frank reach inside his coat for his gun.  He watches Frank
sneak to the back bedroom area.  Jeffrey turns and looks at the Yellow
Man.  He gets an idea. He quickly rushes out of the closet - feels inside
the Yellow Man's coat for his police gun.  It's there.  He gets it but it
causes the Yellow Man to moan and leap some in another almost death-spasm.  Jeffrey takes the bloody pistol and races back inside the closet frantically catching his breath.  Just then he hears Frank in the back room.

          FRANK (V.O.)
     (helium voice)
     Hey pretty pretty.

Jeffrey then hears three or four shots - deadly sounding coming from a
pistol with a silencer attached.

          FRANK (V.O.)
     Hey fuck, where are you?

Jeffrey sees a furious Frank come storming out of the back room and come
slowly up the hall - directly toward him.

Jeffrey raises his pistol - very slowly.  Frank enters the living room.
He looks around.  The Yellow Man moans.  Frank makes a face and blasts the
remainder of the Yellow Man's head away and this time the Yellow Man falls
dead to the floor.  Jeffrey tenses in the silence which hangs in the air.  Frank looks to the kitchen. all around the living room.  He looks at the closet.  He smiles - he slowly goes right toward Jeffrey - smiling.  Jeffrey points the pistol.  His finger

 moves to the trigger.  He squints his eyes.  He doesn't want to kill a man. any man.  Frank comes right to the closet door and throws it open, when Jeffrey hears Sandy scream.

          SANDY (V.O.)
     Jeffrey!!

Frank and Jeffrey lock eyes as Jeffrey pulls the trigger.  He yells Sandy's
name and Frank's head is blown off.

We see Sandy's frightened face.  We see policemen racing up the stairs in
Dorothy's apartment.

223. EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

We see cop cars with lights revolving, radios blaring.

224. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - POLICE STATION - NIGHT

The large room is crowded with policemen and members of the F.B.I.
Everyone is talking excitedly.  Jeffrey and Sandy are sitting by Detective
Williams in wooden chairs near the center of the room.  We hear bits of
conversation.

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
          (to Jeffrey)
     Because of your information I alerted
     internal affairs to check out Detective
     Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as
     if nothing was different.  He slipped
     off on his own when he found out we were
     going to raid Frank's place.

          JEFFREY
     Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?

          DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
     Not yet.

          JEFFREY
     Oh my God. Is her son OK?

          F.B.I. MAN
     We're looking for him. In your opinion,
     why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and
     husband?

          JEFFREY
     He became obsessed with her. She hated
     him. He had to have her. He kidnapped
     them to control her. to make her do
     things. Then she wanted to commit
     suicide so he started cutting off ears
     as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm
     not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue
     velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause
     her whole life was blue.

          F.B.I. MAN
     You seemed to see some very interesting
     things on your little escapade with
     Dorothy Vallens.

          JEFFREY
     Yeah. I guess I did.
          (He turns to Sandy
  with a worried look)
     What's going to happen to me?

          F.B.I. MAN
     We're going to leave that up to Detective
     Williams. I'll tell you though. you're
     okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.

          JEFFREY
     Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how
     many more are out there?

FADE TO BLACK - DARKNESS

225. EXT. BEAUMONTS' BACK YARD - DAY

A huge low roaring sound comes in.

SLOWLY WE COME UP OUT OF A HUGE DARK HOLE. We see we are rising out of an
ear but still among the crevices.  They look enormous.  We move up and
float above the ear and traverse across a cheek to an eye.  Jeffrey's eye.
His face is bathed in light.

All sorts of springtime-in-the-garden sounds are heard.

We suddenly see that Jeffrey is sleeping in his back yard. Detective
Williams is with Mr. Beaumont working in the garden in the distance.
The sprinkler is turning.  Sandy comes out on the back porch and calls.

          SANDY
     Jeffrey. Lunch is ready.

Jeffrey opens his eyes.  He looks around confused for a moment.  He sees
Sandy.

          JEFFREY
     Okay. I'll be right in.

Sandy goes back inside.  Suddenly, a big red ROBIN chirps loudly above.
Jeffrey looks up at it sitting in the cherry tree.  The Robin and Jeffrey
seems to exchange a special look.

Jeffrey smiles up at the fat bird.

He gets off the lawn chair and walks away from us toward the back door of
the house.  As he passes his father and Detective Williams:

          JEFFREY
     How ya doin' Dad?

          MR. BEAUMONT
          (distant voice)
     Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.

          JEFFREY
     Good deal Dad.

He and Detective Williams share a smile.

226. INT. BEAUMONTS' KITCHEN - DAY

Jeffrey enters the kitchen and sees Sandy standing with Aunt Barbara by the
kitchen window.  Beyond, in the living room Mrs. Williams and Jeffrey's
mother turn toward the kitchen when they hear the screen door slam.

A large Red Robin has just flown down to the window still carrying a big
bug in its mouth.

          SANDY
     (Referring to the bird)
     Look Jeffrey.

          JEFFREY
     (As he joins Aunt Barbara and
     Sandy to look at the robin)
     Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe
     the robins are here.

          AUNT BARBARA
     I don't see how they do it. I could
     never eat a bug.

          JEFFREY AND SANDY
          (smiling)
     It's a strange world, isn't it?

                              CUT TO:

227.      EXT. FLOWER GARDEN - DAY

Yellow tulips sway in a warm afternoon breeze.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

228. EXT. SHADY STREET - DAY

A bright red gorgeous fire engine is moving very slowly down the street.

We MOVE IN to see the happy face of a FIREMAN.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

229. EXT. CROSSWALK - SHADY STREET - DAY

A very clean uniformed, smiling POLICEMAN with arms outstretched allows
clean happy SCHOOL CHILDREN to cross the street safely.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

230. EXT. TREE - DAY

A songbird SINGS in a tree.

We are in a beautiful park.  Slowly we move down and a little hat with a
propeller comes into view.  The hat is on the head of a small child who is
dancing slowly toward Dorothy.  She is laughing.  When the boy gets within
arms reach they embrace.  We move close to Dorothy's smiling face.  Tears
of happiness come into her eyes, but there is still a distant look as we
hear Bobby Vinton sing the last lines of his song.

"and I still can see Blue Velvet through
 my tears."

Blue Velvet dissolves in and takes over the image.
