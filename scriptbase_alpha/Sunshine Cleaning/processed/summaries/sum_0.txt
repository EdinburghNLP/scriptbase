A family.
Rose and Norah, in Albuquerque, lost their mother when they were young.
Rose is responsible - a housecleaner, raising her seven-year-old son Oscar.
She's also having an affair with Mac, a married cop, her high-school sweetheart.
Norah can't hold a job.
Their dad, Joe, is quirky.
When Oscar is expelled for odd behavior, Rose wants to earn enough to send him to private school.
Mac suggests she clean up after crime scenes, suicides, and deaths that go undiscovered for awhile.
Rose enlists Norah, and Sunshine Cleaners is born.
Norah bonds with the dead, Rose finds out that it's a regulated business, and complications arise.
Can a family marked by tragedy sort things out?
