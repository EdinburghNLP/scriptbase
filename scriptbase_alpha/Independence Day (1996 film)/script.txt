INDEPENDENCE DAY

     AN AMERICAN FLAG

     Oddly still, posted in gray dusty sand.

     WIDEN TO REVEAL:

     EXT. LUNAR SURFACE - THE MOON

     One small step for man, one large pile of garbage for moon-
     kind.  Untouched for years, the flag stands next to the
     castoff remains of the Apollo mission.  Slowly the discarded
     equipment begins to RATTLE and SHAKE.

     AN ENORMOUS SHADOW creeps towards us blotting out the horizon,
     a loud RUMBLE is heard.

     Suddenly we are covered in DARKNESS as the SHADOW engulfs us.
     Only the lonely image of our EARTH hangs in the air, until a
     huge silhouetted OBJECT suddenly blocks our view.

                                                        CUT TO:

     EXT. NEW MEXICO - RADIO TELESCOPE VALLEY - NIGHT

     A field of large satellite dishes scan the skies.

     Super up: S.E.T.I. INSTITUTE, NEW MEXICO

     INT. INSTITUTE - MONITORING CONTROL CENTER - SAME

     A lone TECHNICIAN works on his putting skills.  Behind him,
     wall to wall technical equipment quietly sifts through data.
     A RED LIGHT begins to flash.

     The Technician turns and slowly walks towards the source.  One
     by one a series of LIGHTS turn on.  The Technician (TECH ONE)
     grabs a pair of headphones.  His eyes widen.

     INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS - SAME

     Sleepily a SUPERVISOR picks up the phone.

                                SUPERVISOR
                If this isn't an insanely
                beautiful woman, I'm hanging up.

     INT. CONTROL CENTER - SAME

                                TECH ONE
                Shut up and listen.

     He holds the phone up to a speaker, increases the volume.  A
     strange FLUCTUATING TONE plays out in sequential patterns.

     INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS - SAME

     HEARING it, the Supervisor BOLTS UP, banging his head on the
     bunk above him.

     INT. CONTROL CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

     A pajama party on acid.  Five other technicians, in various
     states of undress, hover anxiously around the main console.
     The Supervisor enters, tying his robe.

                                SUPERVISOR
                God, I hope it's not just another
                damned Russian spy job.

                                TECH THREE
                     (overlapping)
                Negative.  Computer affirms the
                signal is unidentified.

                                TECH TWO
                     (hanging up the phone)
                The boy from Air Res Traffic say the
                skies are clear.  No terrestrial
                launches.

                                TECH ONE
                It's the real thing.  A radio
                signal from another world.

     The room becomes quiet as they realize that after years of
     searching the heavens, they might have finally found
     something.

                                SUPERVISOR
                Let's not jump the gun.  Run a
                trajectory source computation.

     Tech Three slides over to another computer.

                                SUPERVISOR (cont'd)
                I want to know exactly where it's
                coming from.

                                TECH THREE
                This can't be right.

     Tech Three just stares at his screen in disbelief.

                                SUPERVISOR
                What's wrong?

                                TECH THREE
                Calculated distance from source is
                at three hundred and eight five
                thousand kilometers.
                     (turning to Supervisor)
                It's coming from the moon.

     The Supervisor reaches over and turns up the volume on the
     speaker.  As they listen to the strange TONES we...

     INT. HALLWAY - PENTAGON - SAME

     Elevator doors OPENS revealing four star GENERAL GREY,
     Commander in Chief U.S. Space Command.  Understandably
     nervous, the COMMANDING OFFICER escorts him down the hall.

                                GENERAL GREY
                Who else knows about this?

                                COMMANDING OFFICER
                S.E.T.I. in New Mexico identified a
                signal but they're even more
                confused than we are.

     The General shoots him a disapproving glance.

                                COMMANDING OFFICER
                Excuse me, Sir.

     He slides his security card through the lock and the doors fly
     open.

     INT. SPACE COMMAND - THE PENTAGON - CONTINUOUS

     Banks of computers, Technicians and assistants working
     feverishly through the night.  The Officers cross the room.

     Super: SPACE COMMAND - THE PENTAGON

                                COMMANDING OFFICER
                Satellite reception has been
                impaired but we were able to get
                these.

     They arrive at a glass table.  The surrounding officers snap
     to attention as a SECOND OFFICER quickly brings over a large
     transparency.  We SEE a grainy image of a large vague OBJECT.

                                GENERAL GREY
                Looks like a big turd.

     The two Officers exchange a glance.

                                COMMANDING OFFICER
                We estimate it has a diameter of
                over five hundred and fifty
                kilometers and a mass roughly one
                fourth the size of our moon.

     The General turns to the Second Officer, concerned.

                                GENERAL GREY
                A meteor?

                                SECOND OFFICER
                No Sir.  Definitely not.

                                GENERAL GREY
                How do you know?

                                SECOND OFFICER
                Well, er... it's slowing down.

                                GENERAL GREY
                It's doing what?

                                SECOND OFFICER
                It's... slowing down, Sir.

     The General walks over to a phone, picks it up.

                                GENERAL GREY
                Get me the Secretary of Defense.
                     (pause)
                Then wake him up.

     INT. WHITMORE'S BEDROOM - FRE-DAWN

     Laying in bed THOMAS J. WHITMORE reads a stack of papers.  The
     phone RINGS.

                                WOMAN'S VOICE
                     (filtering through phone)
                Hi. It's me.

     The warm look on Whitmore's face tells us everything about how
     he feels about the woman on the other end.

                                WHITMORE
                Hi honey.  What time is it there?

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     Dressed in a night gown, MRS. MARGARET WHITMORE unpacks her
     briefing papers lays them out on a small desk as she talks.
     Through the window we SEE Los Angeles at night.

                                MARGARET
                Two in the morning.  I know I
                didn't wake you?

                                WHITMORE
                     (filtered)
                As a matter of fact you did.

                                MARGARET
                     (smiles)
                Liar.

     INT. WHITMORE BEDROOM - SAME

     Whitmore sits up.

                                WHITMORE
                I have a confession to make.
                There's a beautiful young blonde
                sleeping next to me.

     Sleeping next to him, his six-year-old daughter, PATRICIA.

                                MARGARET
                     (filtered)
                You didn't let her stay up
                watching T.V. all night?

                                WHITMORE
                Of course not.

     The little girl stirs awake, looks up.

                                PATRICIA
                Mommy?

                                WHITMORE
                You're flying back right after the
                luncheon?  Okay, here she is.

     Whitmore hands her the phone and gets out of bed.  Habitably
     he turns on the television.

     T.V. - NEWS PROGRAM

     Several "Pundits" sit around a MaLaughlin-type news discussion
     program.  The picture quality is snowy, static ridden.

                                PUNDIT #1
                ... the inexperience in public
                office was inevitably going to
                catch up with him.  He's
                scarified his ideals for
                "politics as usual."

     Whitmore ties on his robe as he adjusts the picture quality.

                                PUNDIT #2
                ...I said this during the
                campaign.  Leadership as a pilot
                in the Gulf War has no
                relationship to political
                leadership.  It's a different
                animal...

     Suddenly the channel changes.  A cartoon comes on.  Whitmore
     turns to his daughter who holds he remote.

                                PATRICIA
                     (into phone)
                Daddy let me watch Letterman.

                                WHITMORE
                     Traitor.

     Whitmore exits the room.

     INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

     As Whitmore steps out of his bedroom, a Security guard snaps
     to attention.  Someone hidden behind a newspaper, sits on a
     bench.

                                SECURITY GUARD
                Good morning, Mr. President.

                                WHITMORE
                Good morning, George.

     The paper is dropped revealing CONSTANCE HALBROOK, mid-
     thirties, aggressive, sharp, the President's communications
     director.  Quickly she gathers her things and follows
     Whitmore.

     INT. BREAKFAST TABLE - CONTINUOUS

     Two servants are preparing breakfast as Whitmore and Constance
     enter.  Whitmore sits down, grabs a coffee.

                                WHITMORE
                You're up early this morning,
                Connie.

     She tosses him one of the many newspapers in her hands.

                                CONSTANCE
                They're not attacking your
                policies, they're attacking your
                age.
                     (another paper; reading)
                "...addressing Congress, Whitmore
                seems less like the President and
                more like the orphan child Oliver
                asking, 'please sir, I'd like some
                more.'"

                                WHITMORE
                Clever.

                                CONSTANCE
                Age was never an issue when you
                stuck to your gun.  You were
                thought of as young and
                idealistic.  But the message has
                gotten lost.  There's too much
                compromise, too much politics.

                                WHITMORE
                     (pointedly)
                Isn't it amazing how fast everyone
                can turn against you.

     Realizing she may be pushing him too far, she hands him
     another paper.

                                CONSTANCE
                Well, the Orange County Register
                has named you one of the ten
                sexiest men of the year.

                                WHITMORE
                You see, substance at last.

     An AIDE appears at the doorway.

                                CONSTANCE
                Excuse me, Mr. President.  It's
                the Secretary of Defense.

     Whitmore goes to the phone, picks it up.

                                WHITMORE
                Yes?  Say that again?

     AN OLD RUSSIAN SATELLITE

     Drifting away from us the old Russian satellite becomes
     smaller and smaller.  We PAN with it as we SEE it's on a
     collision course with something huge.

     Suddenly the satellite EXPLODES on IMPACT with the much larger
     object that dwarfs the puny piece of hardware.  As huge as it
     is, we get the feeling we've only seen a portion of the total.

     EXT. CLIFFSIDE PARK - NEW JERSEY - MORNING

     With the New York skyline across the Hudson behind them, old
     men sit in this small park playing chess.  Unlike the others,
     DAVID MARTIN is in his early thirties, sixties hippie meets
     nineties yuppie nerd.

     He concentrates intensely on his next move.  MOISHE. sixties.
     smokes a cigar impatiently.

                What are you waiting?  My social
                security will expire, you'll still

                                DAVID
                I'm thinking.

                                MOISHE
                So think already.

     David makes a move.  Instantly Moishe counters his move.
     David furls his brow in thought.

                                MOISHE
                Again he's thinking.

     Moishe reaches into a paper bag and retrieves a coffee in a
     Styrofoam cup.

                                DAVID
                You have any idea how long it
                takes for those things to
                decompose?

                                MOISHE
                You don't move soon.  I'll begin to
                decompose.

     Just as David finally makes his move, Moishe counters again.
     David shoots him a look and stares back down to the board.

                                MOISHE (cont'd)
                David, I've been meaning to talk
                with you.  It's nice you've been
                spending so much time with me,
                but...

                Dad, don't start.

                                MOISHE
                I'm only saying, it's been what?
                Four years, you still haven't
                signed your divorce papers.

                Three, four.  Move on.  It's not
                healthy.

     Moishe takes a big puff on the cigar and coughs.

                Look who's talking healthy.

     Suddenly David's beeper goes off.

                                MOISHE
                How many times is that now?  You
                trying to get fired?

     David moves his queen.

                                DAVID
                Checkmate.  See you tomorrow, Dad.

     He gives his father a quick kiss and hurries away.

                                DAVID
                It was turned on.  I was ignoring
                you.  What's the big emergency?

                                MARTY
                Started this morning.  Every
                channel is making like it's
                nineteen fifty.  Snow, static, all
                kinds of distortions.  No one
                knows what the hell is going on.

     David deposits his bike in the kitchenette as Marty tosses his
     coke bottle in the trash.  David retrieves it.

                                DAVID
                Damn it, Marty.  There's a reason
                we have bins labeled "recycle."

     Finding more bottles in the trash, David turns to Marty
     accusingly.

                                DAVID
                What the hell is this?

                                MARTY
                So sue me.

     Before David can say anything, Marty ushers him out of the
     room.

     INT. TRANSMISSION FEED - CONTINUOUS

     Technicians are working feverishly.  Clearly every monitor is
     experiencing varying degrees of signal disruption.  David
     moves over to the main console.

                                DAVID
                Did you try to switch to
                transponder channels?

                                MARTY
                Please, would I be this panicked
                if it was that simple?

     David examines the readouts, puzzled.

                                DAVID
                Let's retrofit the dish to another
                satellite.

                                MARTY
                We've tried.  It's not working.
                It's almost as though they
                weren't even there.

     David looks up, puzzled.

                                DAVID
                That's impossible.

     INT. MOBILE HOME - DAY

     Eleven-year-old TROY BRENNON tries to fix the television.
     His older brother MIGUEL, seventeen, cooks breakfast.

                                MIGUEL
                Stop it.

                                TROY
                It's all fuzzy.

                                MIGUEL
                You're gonna break it.  Just leave
                it alone.  Here, take your
                medicine.

     Miguel sits a small bottle of medicine and a spoon down in
     front of Troy.  Troy pushes the bottle away.

                                TROY
                I don't need it.

                                MIGUEL
                     (pushing it back)
                Just take it, dick head.
                     (turning to his sister)
                Alicia!  Make sure he takes his
                medicine.

     His sister, ALICIA, fourteen, hormones kicking in, testing
     boundaries, listens to her walkman while putting on too much
     makeup.  Miguel throws a dish towel to get her as Troy hits
     the television again.

     EXT. TRAILER PARK - SAME - MORNING

     A beat up pick-up truck comes down a dirt road and skids to a
     halt on the gravel next to the Brennon Mobile Home at this
     small shabby countryside trailer park.  An angry FARMER jumps
     out, slamming his door.

     INT. BRENNON MOBILE HOME - SAME

     Alicia opens the front door and smiles flirtatiously at the
     angry farmers, LUCAS, who marches over.  Miguel edges her out
     of the doorway, wanting to handle this himself.

                                MIGUEL
                Morning, Lucas.

     Lucas holds a bowl full of rotted vegetables.

                                LUCAS
                You like these!  I've got a whole
                goddamned crop full!

     Unceremoniously, he dumps them at Miguel's feet.

                                LUCAS (cont'd)
                Where the hell is your father?
                You know what time it is?

                                MIGUEL
                He had to re-fuel.  There musta
                been a problem.

                                LUCAS
                We both know what the problem is.
                He's a damned nut case, is what he
                is.  I musta been out of my mind.

     Troy SMACKS the television again.

                                MIGUEL
                Troy, stop it!  I swear to God!

                                LUCAS
                Miguel, if he's not in the air in
                twenty minutes, that's it.  I'm
                getting someone else.

     Lucas storms away.  Again, Troy whacks at the television.

                                MIGUEL
                Stop it, Troy!  I swear to God!

     Determined, Troy HITS the television again.  This time the
     picture goes out completely.

     Constance escapes into the elevator, turns around.

     INT. OVAL OFFICE - WIDE SHOT - SAME

     The President, General Grey, the SECRETARY OF DEFENSE and
     White House Chief of Staff ALBERT NIMZIKI are gathered around
     the couch.

                                SEC. OF DEFENSE
                At the moment, our satellites are
                somewhat unreliable.  Isn't it
                possible that thing may just pass
                us by?

                                NIMZIKI
                What if it doesn't "pass us by?"
                Let's retarget some ICBMs to blow
                it out of the sky...

                                GENERAL GREY
                Forgive me, but with the little
                information we do have, the only
                thing that would accomplish is
                turn one dangerous falling object
                into many.

     Just then the door opens and Constance enters.

                                PRESIDENT WHITMORE
                What's the damage?

                                CONSTANCE
                The press is making up their own
                stories at this point.

                Get on the horn with Atlantic

                situation to DEFCON 3.

                                GENERAL GREY
                That's not your call to make, Mr.
                Nimziki.

                                CONSTANCE
                Isn't that a little premature?

                                NIMZIKI
                I don't think so.

                                SEC OF DEFENSE
                We're two days away from the fourth
                of July.  We have over fifty percent
                of our armed forces on weekend leave,
                not to mention the troops and
                commanders we   have in town for the
                Fourth of July  parade.  We call them
                back now, we're sending up a major red
                flag.

     They go quiet as Commanding Officer from Space Command dashes
     into the room.

                                COMMANDING OFFICER
                Our intelligence tells us the
                object has settled into a
                stationary orbit.

                                NIMZIKI
                Well that's good news.

                                COMMANDING OFFICER
                Not really.

     He lays out the diagrams and photos on the table.  Everyone
     gathers around.

                                COMMANDING OFFICER
                Part of it has broken off into
                nearly three dozen other pieces.

                                PRESIDENT WHITMORE
                Pieces?

                                COMMANDING OFFICER
                Smaller than the whole, yet over
                fifteen miles in width themselves.

                                NIMZIKI
                Where are they heading?

                                COMMANDING OFFICER
                They should be entering our
                atmosphere within the next twenty-
                five minutes.

     The room is silenced.  All eyes turn to the President who says
     nothing.  Nimziki leans in close to him.

                                NIMZIKI
                Like it or not, we're at DEFCON 3.

                                DAVID
                No.  The good news is I found the
                problem and it's not our
                equipment.  There's some weird

                                DAVID
                Yes, because the analog signal has

                patterns embedded within it.  When

     EXT. CALIFORNIA FARMLANDS, IMPERIAL VALLEY - DAY

     Racing over back roads behind a long open field, Miguel rides
     his beat-up motor bike, searching.  Looking up he SEES
     something in the air.

     MIGUEL'S POV - AN OLD BI-WING AIRPLANE

     converted into a crop-duster, BUZZES overhead.  Spraying
     insecticide wildly, the plane zigzags over the field.

                                MIGUEL
                     (yelling)
                Russell!  God damn it, Russell!

     Looking down from the cockpit, RUSSELL BRENNON waves stupidly.
     Shaggy blonde hair and two days' growth, Russell is the image
     of a fifty-one-year-old little boy.

     Miguel follows him below, screaming at him.  Russell, flying
     recklessly, looks down at Miguel not understanding.  By the
     time he looks back he SEES...

     A LINE OF TREES

     at the edge of the field, nearly on top of him.  In a trick
     move, Russell turns the plane on ITS SIDE, and SLICES through
     the narrow gap between the trees.

     Miguel screams with delight at his prowess.  Miguel looks
     pissed.

     ANGLE - OTHER SIDE OF TREES - MOMENTS LATER

     Miguel races over, skidding to a halt next to the landed Bi-
     with plane.

                                MIGUEL

                I'm bringing home the bacon.
                Earning my keep.  And doing a fine
                job if I do say so myself.

                                MIGUEL
                It's the wrong field, you idiot!
                Lucas' farm is on the other side
                of town.

                                RUSSELL
                You sure?

                                MIGUEL
                Damn it, he was doing you a favor.
                You know how hard it is to find
                someone who doesn't think you're

                Huh?  Where are we supposed to go
                now?

     Pissed, Miguel peels away, kicking gravel back at Russell.
     Pathetically, he reaches into his jacket and pulls out a
     bottle of Jack Daniels.  He takes a healthy swig.

     A BEDOUIN stokes a small fire besides his family's tent.
     Suddenly a group of shouting SCREAMING TRIBES PEOPLE come
     rushing past him.

     The Bedouin watches them with confusion.  Overcome with
     curiosity he goes against the tide of people, up the hillside.

     As the Bedouin reaches the top of the hillside, his mouth
     falls open, aghast as he SEES...

     THE SKIES - THE PHENOMENON

     Creeping from across the horizon above the rocky mountain
     terrain, a wide FIREBALL high in the sky, flaring and
     exploding.  A terrifying sight.

     Super: Battle Carrier, USS Eisenhower - Persian Gulf

     INT. USS EISENHOWER - RADAR ROOM - DAY

     A loud KLAXON ALARM is ringing out.  The FIRST LIEUTENANT
     comes rushing in.

                                LIEUTENANT
                Ensign, status?

                                SAILOR #1
                We have a total radar black out
                over a thirteen kilometer area.

     The Lieutenant moves over to the main radar screen.  The
     entire upper portion of the screen is BLANK.  And the blank
     area is MOVING.

                                LIEUTENANT
                Have a complete diagnostic run...

                                SAILOR #1
                Excuse me sir, radar may be
                malfunctioning but infrared is off
                the map!

     He diverts the Lieutenant's attention to another screen; A
     BRIGHT SEA OF RED light bleeds off the map.

                                LIEUTENANT
                Get the CINC Atlantic Command on
                the line.

     A technical OFFICER rips off a data sheet as it shoots out of

                Sir, we now have visual range with
                incoming over Iraqi airspace.

                                COMMANDING OFFICER
                A second sighting?

                                OFFICER
                Yes Sir, this just came in from
                the Eisenhower.

     The Commanding Officer grabs a phone laying off the hook.

                                COMMANDING OFFICER
                Correction, we have two confirmed
                visual contacts.  One over Iraq,
                one over the Pacific.

     INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY

     The room is packed.  The President and his chief advisors are
     there along with the Joint Chief of Staff.  Representatives
     from the Atlantic Command and U.S. Space Command have formed
     small clusters around telephones.

                                GENERAL GREY
                Where in the Pacific?
                     (turning to the President)
                They've spotted one off the
                California coast line.

     Surrounded by the Secret Service, the President is speechless.
     Constance Halbrook comes rushing into the room and whispers to
     the President.

                                PRESIDENT
                Put it on.

     Constance moves over to a cabinet and turns on the T.V. (the
     reception is still fuzzy, picture "rolling").  The CNN News
     broadcast shows the phenomenon over Novosibirsk, Russia.
     There is mass hysteria behind the reporter.

     General Grey confers with the Atlantic command CINC.  He nods,

                Mr. President, we have an AWAC on

                That's correct.  We're IMC blind,
                sir.

     We TRACK across them over to the pilots and into the cockpit.
     Cloudy skies.  The PILOT squints out the window as he speaks.

                                PILOT

     The AWAC disappears from view into the clouds.

     INT. OVAL OFFICE - SAME

     The President and his top advisors are gathered around a

                Mr. President, you can discuss
                this on the way.

     Torn, the President grapples with a decision.  Finally...

                                PRESIDENT
                I'm not leaving.

                                NIMZIKI
                We must maintain a working

                to a secured location.
                I'm staying here.  I am not going
                to add to a public hysteria that
                could cost lives.

                                NIMZIKI
                But, Mr. President...

                                PRESIDENT
                So far these things have not
                become hostile.  For the moment
                let's assume they won't.
                     (to Constance)
                Connie, let's issue statements
                advising people not to panic, to
                stay home and take cover.

     Constance issues commands to her staff as they quickly
     exit along with most people in the room.  General Grey goes
     over to the President.

                become hostile?

                I know, you're probably still a

     traces of extinguishing flames illuminate it.

     INT. COMPACT CABLE - STAIRWELL - SAME

     David pushes past the people making their way down, fighting
     against the tide.  Another CO-WORKER (#3) stops halfway.

                                CO-WORKER #3
                Aren't you coming, David?

                                DAVID
                No way, I've got to see this.

     EXT. WASHINGTON MONUMENT - SAME

     Frightened tourists run for cover as the colossal SHADOW
     approaches.  Reflected in the water below we SEE the fiery
     apparition transfigure into the dark foreboding clouds.

     THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL - WASHINGTON, D.C. - SAME

     The SHADOW writhes up the detailed statue of Lincoln,
     devouring him completely until we are left in total darkness.

     INT. WHITE HOUSE - HALLWAYS - SAME

     People are being evacuated from their offices.  Patricia, the
     President's daughter, breaks away from her nanny.

     INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - SAME

     The President talks on the phone.  Constance waits nearby.

                                PRESIDENT WHITMORE
                     (into phone)
                Of course, Russia and the United
                States are in this together.  Yes,
                Mr. President, you have my word.
                Yes, Das Vedanya.

     The President hangs up.

                                CONSTANCE
                What is their position?

                                PRESIDENT WHITMORE
                I think he was drunk.

     Patricia bursts through the door and runs into her father's
     arms, terrified.  A SECRET SERVICE man appears.

                                SECRET SERVICE GUY
                Mr. President, we have to go.

     Abruptly, the room DARKENS as it begins to RUMBLE.

     EXT. WHITE HOUSE - SAME

     The long, dark SHADOW moves across the entire White House,
     engulfing it in darkness.

     EXT. HUDSON RIVER, NEW YORK - STATUE OF LIBERTY - SAME

     In the distance we SEE the mutated phenomenon's dark gray
     clouds nearing Miss. Liberty.  As it approaches we SEE the New
     York skyline begin to darken.

     EXT. BLACK TOP BASKET BALL COURT, NEW YORK - SAME

     Kids playing basket ball.  A young BOY stops playing, staring
     skyward.  One by one, they all look upwards, stunned as a long
     dark SHADOW creeps over them.

     With a loud CRASH, several New York Cabs SLAM into one another
     in the street.  Two more cars crash into them.  A pile up
     ensues.

     EXT. WALL STREET - SECOND LATER

     Foot traffic stops as the long SHADOW crawls over the entire
     area.

     EXT. ROOFTOP - COMPACT CABLE - SAME

     Large satellite dishes beset a doorway to the roof which flies
     open.  David steps out just as a long, dark SHADOW covers over
     him, sending the city into darkness.  David looks up to SEE...

     SKYLINE AND ALIEN CRAFT

     Protruding through the dark clouds we get a glimpse of the
     underbelly of a colossal ALIEN CRAFT, its outer veneer of
     smoke and clouds beginning to fade away.

     Below we see PANIC, cabs SLAMMING into one another, people
     staring, people screaming.  No one knows how to react.

     David runs to the other side of the rooftop, overlooking
     Central Park, to get a better look.

     DAVID'S POV - CENTRAL PARK - SAME

     The entire park is plunged into darkness as the craft above
     blots out of the sun.  Amazing as it may seem, the hovering craft
     BLANKETS THE ENTIRE PARK and BEYOND.  We still have NOT seen
     an entire craft.

                                DAVID
                     (realizing)
                My God.  The signal.

     EXT. LOS ANGELES BASIN - WIDE ANGLE - LATER MORNING

     A panoramic view of the Los Angeles basin.  Slowly filling the
     screen, we SEE a portion of the enormous space craft as it
     creeps towards the city, obliterating our view.

     EXT. HILLSIDE RESIDENTIAL AREA - SAME

     A station wagon, filled with kids and a harried HOUSEWIFE,
     comes to a stop.  The passenger door opens and a young six-
     year-old boy, DYLAN steps out.

                                HOUSEWIFE
                Dylan, tell your mom you can stay
                overnight again Thursday.

     Suddenly a car SAILS over a nearby hill in front of them,
     hitting the ground with a BANG.  Two more cars follows, air
     bound.  As the Housewife turns she SEES...

     SPACE SHIP - SAME

     Rising over the mountain we SEE the Space Ship as it nears the
     city, blocking out the sunshine.

     Panicked, the Housewife hits the gas and peels out, leaving a
     confused Dylan staring skyward.

     INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Two people sleep as Dylan runs into the room.

                                DYLAN
                Mommy, look at!

     He rushes away.  The SHADOW moves past the window, darkening
     the room.  His mother, JASMINE DUBROW, stirs.

                                JASMINE
                     (re: darkness)
                It's too early, baby.

     She turns back over.  Suddenly the room briefly RUMBLES.

                                MAN
                Earthquake?

                                JASMINE
                Not even a four pointer.  Go back
                to sleep.

     Shrugging, the man does.

     HOLLYWOOD SIGN (FORMERLY SC. 72) - SAME

     In Los Angeles.  The SHADOW slowly covers the sign.

     EXT. WHITE HOUSE - WINDOW - SAME

     The President and his daughter cautiously approach the window
     staring in awe at the amazing sight above them.  Several
     others approach from behind.

     Cautiously some people begin to walk outside, staring up at
     the leviathan, mouths agape.

     INT. OVAL OFFICE - SAME

     Slowly staff members approach, gazing out the window.
     Constance steps up behind the President.

                                CONSTANCE
                What do we do now?

                                PRESIDENT WHITMORE
                Address the nation.  There are a
                lot of very frightened people out
                there right now.

                                CONSTANCE
                Yeah.  I'm one of them.

     EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - ALIEN CRAFT - SAME

     All of Washington is under the shadow of this gargantuan alien
     craft.  A stunning tableau.

     INT. JASMINE'S DEBROW'S BEDROOM - SAME

     The man sleeping next to Jasmine's beagle BOOMER drops
     Steven's tennis shoes on top of him, waking him.

                                JASMINE
                He's trying to impress you.

                                STEVE
                He's doing a good job.

     He pats the dog on the head and takes the shoes.  Steven gets
     up and makes his way to the bathroom.

     INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

     As Steve takes a pee, he SEES out the window a family packing
     up their car, others standing around staring at something in
     the distance.  A HELICOPTER flies overhead.

                                STEVE
                Neighbors are moving.  I think
                they're tired of earthquakes.

     He finished and flushes.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Steve enters the living room.  The television is playing a
     news broadcast.

                                NEWSCASTER
                ...with little damage reported to
                the southland area.  People are
                advised not to panic...

                                STEVE
                Hon, something's on the table 'bout
                the quake.

     Jasmine sits up in bed, yelling out to Steve.

                                JASMINE
                Dylan out there?

     Steve turns, looking for Dylan when the doggie door pops open
     and Dylan crawls through.

                                STEVE
                What have you been up to, Sport?

                                DYLAN
                     (holding his gun)
                Shooting aliens.

     Steve musses up the boy's hair, smiling.

                                JASMINE
                     (entering)
                Coffee?

     Steve mumbles an affirmative as he exits.

     EXT. JASMINE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     Steve picks up the morning paper and opens it.  He doesn't
     notice the DOZENS of neighbors quickly packing up and rushing
     to get away as he reads the paper oblivious.

                                JASMINE (O.S.)
                You want milk with your coffee?

     Jasmine appears behind him, her view, too, obscured by the
     open newspaper.  Suddenly another HELICOPTER room overhead.
     Annoyed, Steve lowers his paper.

     STEVE AND JASMINE'S POV

     As the paper is lowered we SEE the helicopter SWOOP down.  As
     it flies away we SEE...

     THE ALIEN CRAFT

     Covering all of Los Angeles.  This is the first time we see
     the entire craft.  It is stupendous.  Steve's jaw hits the
     floor.  The milk goes CRASHING as Jasmine SCREAMS.

     Running for all he's worth, David sprints down the stairs.

     INT. COMPACT CABLE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     Dashing off the stairs, David stops seeing that the room is
     now completely empty.  The wall of monitors play for no one.
     David walks up to one, adjusting the volume.

     T.V. - CNN BROADCAST - (DISTORTED BROADCAST SIGNAL)

     A space ship logo spins next to the words VISITORS: CONTACT OR
     CRISIS.  Wolf Blitzer comes on screen live from the Pentagon.

                                WOLF BLITZER
                Pentagon officials are reporting
                more ships have just arrived over
                the capitals of India, England and
                Germany.

     As he speaks we get quick glimpses of the other ships.

                                MARTY (O.S.)
                I know, babycakes.  Calm down.

     David spins around at the sound of the voice but the room is
     still empty.  David leans down and looks under a desk where he
     finds Marty still on the phone with his wife.

                                DAVID
                Tell her to get the kids and leave
                town.

                                MARTY
                What happened?

                     (yells)
                Just do it!

     Marty realizes David is dead serious.

                                MARTY
                Babycakes, pack the kids up and
                take them to your mother's.  Don't
                ask.  Go.

     Mary hangs up, crawls out from under the table.

                                MARTY (cont'd)
                Okay, why did I just send my
                family to Atlanta?

                                DAVID
                Remember I told you that the
                signal hidden within our satellite
                signal is slowly recycling down to
                extinction.

                                MARTY
                Not really...

                                DAVID
                That signal.  It's a countdown.

                     (confused)
                A countdown to what?

                                DAVID
                Think.  It's like in chess.  First
                you strategically position your
                pieces.  Then, when the timing's
                right.  You strike.

     David motions to the television.

                They are positioning themselves
                all over the world and using this
                one signal to synchronize their
                efforts.  In approximately six
                hours the signal will disappear
                and the countdown will be over.

                                MARTY
                Then what?

                                DAVID
                Checkmate.

     Marty takes a beat to digest.  Then, grabbing the phone....

                                MARTY
                I gotta call my brother, my
                bookie, my lawyer... fuck my

     As Constance watches the President, she unconsciously mouths
     the words of his speech, after all, she did write them.  A
     PRESS AIDE tugs on her sleeve.  She tries to wave her off.

                He says he's your husband.

                It's not paranoia.  The embedding
                is very subtle.  It's probably
                been overlooked...

     Constance hangs up.  Her face betrays mixed emotions.

     Steve, wearing his Marine flight officer uniform, shoves the
     last of his things into his duffel bag.  We notice there are
     small figurines of dolphins everywhere.  Jasmine hovers
     nervously behind him.

                                JASMINE
                You can't go.  Call them back.

                                STEVE
                Baby, you know how it is.  I have
                to report to El Toro right away.

                                JASMINE
                You said you were on leave for the
                Fourth.

                                STEVE
                They cancelled it.  Why are you
                acting like this?

     Jasmine grabs the blinds and yanks them away.  We SEE the
     alien craft through the window.

                                JASMINE
                Why?  That's why.  That thing
                scares the piss out of me.

     EXT. DEBROW HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     Dylan sits behind the wheel pretending to drive.  Steve grabs
     him, pulling him out.  He reaches into his duffel, grabs a small
     brown paper bag.

                                STEVE
                Here.  I got these for you.  Be
                careful with them.

     Dylan opens the bag; fireworks.  Jasmine walks over.

                                DYLAN
                Cool.

     Steve tosses his gear into the back, opens his door.

                                JASMINE
                Wait.  I have to tell you
                something.

                                STEVE
                What?

                                JASMINE
                     (loses her nerve)
                Be careful.

                                STEVE
                Look, after your shift tonight,
                why don't you grab Dylan and come
                stay with me on base.

                                JASMINE
                Really?  You don't mind?

                                STEVE
                     (smiling)
                Naw.  I'll just tell my other
                girlfriends they can't come over
                tonight.

     Pissed, she hits him.  He loves it.

                                JASMINE
                You know, you're not as charming
                as you think you are.

                                STEVE
                Yes, I am.

                                JASMINE
                Dick-weed!

                                STEVE
                Butt-munch.

     They kiss.  Steve hops into his car and peels out.  Jasmine
     takes the bag from Dylan.

                                JASMINE
                I'll take these.

                                DYLAN

     A perfectly preserved '68 Olds drives cautiously down the
     highway.  Around him we see other cars packed to the gills as
     they make their escape from New York.

     INT. OLDS - SAME

     Not the most confident driver, Moishe holds the steering wheel
     close to his chest.

                Tell me something, you're so smart

                Okay, fine but the second your

     He hands Patty the phone as General Grey and Nimziki appear in

     A long crowded highway of people trying to escape from Los
     Angeles can be seen in the distance.  The huge space craft
     hovering behind them.

     Miguel is on the roof of the trailer, adjusting the T.V.
     antenna trying to get a picture.  Suddenly the image clears
     and we SEE a group of people in a crowded hallway.

                                REPORTER

     On the T.V. we SEE Russell being escorted to a police car.
     Mortified, Miguel can't believe what he's seeing.

                                RUSSELL
                They've got to do something.
                I was abducted by space aliens ten
                years ago.  They did all kinds of
                experiments on me.  They've been
                studying us for years, learning
                our weakness.  We've go to do
                something before they kill us all!

                                TROY (O.S.)

     Just as Troy starts to climb up, Miguel changes the channel to
     Mrs. Whitmore.  Troy sits down next to Miguel.

                Yeah.  What would you think if we
                went there to live for a while?

                                TROY
                That'd be cool!

     Miguel thinks for a second, makes a decision.

                                MIGUEL
                Pack up, we're going.

     Miguel jumps down from the roof.  Troy climbs down the ladder.

     ALICIA AND OLDER BOY

     Kissing.  It's getting hot.  Alicia laughs, pushes him away.

                                OLDER BOY
                This could be our last night on
                Earth.  You don't want to die a

                What makes you think I'm a virgin?

     The Older Boy is taken off guard.  Before he can answer the
     tarp they were hiding under is ripped away.  Miguel stands
     there.

                                MIGUEL
                Come on, we're going.

                                ALICIA

     Miguel grabs her by the wrist and pulls her away.

     EXT. FREEWAY - OUTSIDE WASHINGTON - NIGHT

     We see the long highway leading to Washington, the space ship
     hovering above it.  One side of the freeway is packed solid,
     the other completely empty, save for one car...

     INT. MOISHE'S OLDS - NIGHT

     Moishe looks to the other side of the freeway, jam packed.  On
     his side, they are the only car for miles.

                                MOISHE

                out of Washington and we're the
                only schmucks trying to get in.

     As Moishe drives, David distracts him as he unpacks his
     backpack unloading his laptop.  He grabs a CD.

                Sometimes it's just her first
                initial, sometime her nickname...

     David starts to look it up.  Suddenly...

     DOZENS OF CARS HEADING STRAIGHT FOR THEM

     In the attempt to get out, hundreds of cars have been re-
     directed by the military to use the opposite side of the
     highway.

                                MOISHE
                Oh my God!

     Moishe SWERVES violently to avoid collision, barely missing
     the oncoming traffic.  Dodging right to left, Moishe hangs on
     for dear life.

     A Military Office, assisting in diverting the cars turns just
     in time to see the Olds whiz by.

     David and Moishe are bounded around the inside of the car as
     Moishe tries to veer through traffic.

     Suddenly A TRUCK  blocks off their only escape route.

     Moishe turns HARD and drives up onto the right shoulder.

     OVERHEAD ANGLE - OLDS AND TRAFFIC

     The Olds is the only car in headed that direction.  Using the
     shoulder, swerving to miss barricades, they drives off an exit
     ramp.

                                DAVID
                Nice driving, pops!

     Dangerously close to a heart attack, Moishe is, for once, at a

     The streets are nearly deserted.  Millions of small lights on
     the underbelly of the craft cast strange reflections on the
     streets below.  The Olds drives on its way towards the Capitol
     building.

                                DAVID
                I just haven't found it yet.  I

                She didn't take my name when we
                were married.

     Moishe shrugs.  David gives it a shot.  Finds it.  The machine
     BEEPS.

     INT. LOCKER ROOM - EL TORO MARINE CORPS STATION - NIGHT

     A crowded locker room.  Steve enters.

                                MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                Where the hell've you been?

                                STEVE
                Ah, were you guys waiting for me?

     Several Marines throws towels at Steve as he makes his way to
     his locker.  His best friend, JIMMY, sits next to him.

                                JIMMY
                Can you believe it?  This is
                serious shit, Stevie.  They've
                recalled everyone!

     As Steve sits he SEES some envelops stuck into the side of his
     locker.

                                STEVE
                Well, the mail's still working.

     He flips through the envelops and FREEZES when he sees one
     with the NASA insignia on it.  Jimmy snatches it away from
     him.

                                JIMMY
                Junk mail.  You don't want this.

     Steve quickly snatches it back, right it open and reads.  From
     the disappointment on his face we can tell it's bad news.
     Realizing, Jimmy puts a hand on Steve's shoulder.

                                JIMMY
                I don't believe it.  They make you
                learn how to fly everything from
                an Apache to a Harrier and still
                they turn you down?  What else do
                they want you to learn?

                                STEVE
                How to kiss ass.

     Steve crumples at the letter and tosses it.  Angrily he opens his
     locker.  Pasted on the locker door we see photos of Jasmine
     next to the photos of the space shuttle, Apollo Missions, and a
     NASA insignia bumper sticker.

     As Steve stuffs his jacket into the locker, something falls
     out.  Before Steve can grab it, Jimmy snatches it up first.

                                JIMMY
                     (embarrassed)
                Jasmine has this thing for
                dolphins.  I had them make it...

                                STEVE
                I thought you said you were doing
                to break it off.

     Steve snatches it back, embarrassed.

                                JIMMY (cont'd)
                Steve, listen to me, you're never
                gonna get to fly the space shuttle
                if you marry a stripper.

     Steve knows he's right.  He's torn.

     The Olds stops near the White House.  From here we can SEE

     gathered, upset about the military hardware.  Signs: "Don't
     provoke" "Violence begets Violence."

     David adjusts a small portable satellite, connecting it to his

                So, you want to ring the bell or
                should I?

     David flips open the phone, dials the number on the screen.

                                DAVID
                Perfect, she's using it.

     The moment she hangs up, it RINGS.  Surprised, she answers.

                                CONSTANCE

                Walk to the window.  Right in

     Constance looks up to the large glass windows.  She walks over
     to it, looking out.

     Between two of the tanks outside, Constance can SEE David
     standing on top of the Olds across the street.  Moishe steps

     something comes SAILING DOWN FROM THE SKY.

     We realize it's the B-WING PLANE landing on the stretch of
     roadway directly in front of them.

     EXT. ROADWAY - CONTINUOUS

     The plane lands, skids into a turn.  Russell jumps out, walks
     over to the trailer.  We can tell he's drunk again.

                                MIGUEL
                They let you out?

                Just what the hell do you think
                you're doing?

     Miguel moves to meet Russell away from the trailer, not
     wanting the others to hear.

                                MIGUEL
                We're leaving, don't try and stop
                us.

                                RUSSELL
                You're not going anywhere.  You
                hear me?  I'm still your father.

     Miguel explodes, this has been building up for some time.

                                MIGUEL
                No, you're not!  You're just the man
                who married my mother.  You're
                nothing to me!

     Russell is momentarily silent, stunned.  Recovering...

                Troy's still my son no matter how
                you feel about me.

                                MIGUEL
                For once in your life think about
                what's best for Troy.  Who has to
                beg for money to buy him medicine
                when you screw up?  Who?

     Suddenly we hear glass CRASHING.  Both men spin to find Troy
     standing behind them.

                                TROY
                Stop it!  I'm not a baby!  I don't
                need your stupid medicine.  I
                don't need anyone to take care of
                me!

     Miguel leans down to see the broken MEDICINE BOTTLE on the
     floor.  Miguel rushes over to him, furious.

                                MIGUEL
                You know what this stuff costs?
                Do you want to get sick again!?
                Do you!?

     Frustrated, Miguel shoves Troy aside and heads back into the
     trailer.  Wobbly from the drinking, Russell stands there
     pathetically, watching.

     David draws a circle representing Earth and a smaller circle
     just away from it.  The President reluctantly nears.

                ...If you wanted t coordinate

                called line of sight...

     Drawing a line from the ship of either side of the Earth, we
     SEE that you could not send a signal to the other side.

                                DAVID (cont'd)
                ...you'd need to relay your signal
                using satellites...

     David draws small satellites surrounding Earth.

                                DAVID (cont'd)
                ...to reach each ship.  I have
                found a signal hidden inside our
                own satellite network.

     Suddenly an aide, ALEX, appears in the doorway.

                                ALEX
                Excuse me, Mr. President.  They're
                starting.

     The President turns to the monitor in his office.  We SEE the
     helicopters turning on the light boards affixed to the front
     of their cockpits.  He turns back to David.

                                DAVID
                Mr. President, they are using our
                own satellites against us and the
                clock is ticking.

     EXT. HELICOPTERS - SAME - NIGHT

     The large light panels TURN ON, multi-colored lights slowly
     begins to flash in a repeating sequential patterns.

     REVERE ANGLE - HELICOPTERS AND SPACE CRAFT

     The helicopters are puny little specs next to this Goliath.
     The light boards continues to FLASH but there is no reaction
     from the ship.

     INT. BRIEFING ROOM - SECONDS LATER

     Everyone is glued to the monitors as the President storms in.

                                PRESIDENT
                General Grey, co-ordinate with
                Atlantic Command.  Tell them they
                have twenty five minutes to get as
                many people out of the cities as
                they can.

                                GENERAL GREY
                But Mr. President...

                                PRESIDENT
                And get those helicopters away
                from the ship.  Call them back
                immediately.

     General Grey obeys, turning to an assistant who quickly grabs
     a phone.  Nimziki steps up to the President.

                                NIMZIKI
                What the hell's going on?

                                PRESIDENT
                We're leaving.

     An AIDE motions to the monitors.

                                AIDE
                They're responding.

     The room goes silent, everyone turns to the monitors.

     MONITOR - NEWS PROGRAM & NIGHT VISION VIDEO

     On all screens we SEE the space ship as a long thin line of
     WHITE LIGHT suddenly emits from the side of the craft,
     illuminating the four Apache Helicopters.

     EXT. APACHE HELICOPTERS - SAME

     The light boards are overpowered by the bright light coming
     from the space craft.  Suddenly with a loud SCREECHING NOISE,
     the white light spills out as the huge OPENING unfolds at the
     side of the craft.

     The four helicopters have to flight to hold their positions, as
     something powerful emits from the schism in the ship.

     Then like a gigantic bug-zapper, the four pesky little Apache
     Helicopters are BLOWN OUT OF THE SKY, one by one.  They leave
     no time to retreat.

     INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

     Mrs. Whitmore packs her bag, as the horrifying image of the
     destruction of the helicopter replays on the T.V.

                                SECRET SERVICEMAN
                Mrs. Whitmore?  The President has
                ordered the evacuation.  We have
                to leave, now.

     She slams her valise SHUT and quickly exits.

     POLICE HELICOPTER

     SOARS over us, headed directly for downtown Los Angeles.

     EXT. ROOFTOP - SAME

     The UFO true believers are still there, holding up their
     signs.  Making her way through several of them we see Tiffany.
     She looks up to the spacecraft above.

                                TIFFANY
                     (awed)
                It's beautiful.

     She digs her drawing of an alien out of her purse as she
     excitedly rushes up to the others.  She holds it up to the
     sky, proudly.

     POLICE HELICOPTER

     From out of nowhere the helicopter LIFTS up over the side of
     the building, shining its spotlight down the believers
     below.

                                POLICE (P.A.)
                ...we are evacuating the city.
                Please leave the building at once.

     The sign holders begin to "boo" the police, ignoring them.

     EXT. CITY STREET - PASADENA THROUGHWAY - SAME

     The freeway is packed on both sides, every car headed out of
     town.  There is no opposing traffic.

     INT. JASMINE'S CAR - SAME

     Dylan holds Boomers as Jasmine drives.  The news plays over her
     car radio.

                                RADIO VOICE
                ...authorities have called for a
                complete evacuation of Los Angeles
                County.  People are advised to
                avoid the highways whenever
                possible.

                                JASMINE
                Now he tells me.

     EXT. WHITE HOUSE - SAME

     The President stops on his way to the Presidential helicopter
     as an aide brings his daughter outside.  The President ushers
     her into the helicopter.  He turns back and see a military
     guard holding back Moishe and David.

                                PRESIDENT
                They're okay.  Let them on!

     INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

     The President steps inside, turns to General Grey.

                                PRESIDENT
                Is my wife in the air?

                                GENERAL GREY
                She should be shortly.

     David flips open his laptop which reads: 09:07. 09:96...

     EXT. WHITE HOUSE LAWN - HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

     The Presidential helicopter lifts off as several other
     helicopters wait behind, people filing into them.

     EXT. ROOFTOPS - LOS ANGELES - SAME

     The Police helicopter is still flashing their lights at the
     UFO believers who refuse to budge.  Suddenly the entire
     rooftop is BATHED IN WHITE LIGHT.  They all grow silent
     staring up at the craft.

     Above them another SCHISM has opened at the bottom of the
     craft, the white light spilling out.

     As though the heavens had opened, the UFO believers lift their
     arms, waiting to be taken.

                                BELIEVERS
                Take me!  No, take me!  Take me!

     Slowly, this beam of light from the base of the ship
     INTENSIFIES directly on the top of this building.

     EXT. HELIPORT - SAME

     Standing on this rooftop heliport directly across from the UFO
     believers, the First Lady watches them, concerned.

                                SECRET SERVICEMAN
                     (yelling over helicopter)
                Mrs. Whitmore!

     Reluctantly, the First Lady turns and runs for the helicopter.
     The door is shut and the helicopter takes off.

     EXT. THE CAPITOL BUILDING - SAME

     With a ROAR, the Presidential helicopter ZOOMS past, behind it
     we see an enormous SCHISM opening beneath the space craft.

     EXT. WHITE HOUSE - SAME

     Alex is helping people get onto the remaining helicopters.
     Suddenly he is bathed in WHITE LIGHT.  He looks up and sees
     the SCHISM, its WHITE BEAM coming directly down upon the White
     House.

     EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - SAME

     The pinnacle of this landmark is abruptly illuminated in WHITE
     LIGHT.  We PAN UP to the space craft above, the beam
     intensifying from the SCHISM below the ship.

     EXT. ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE - SAME

     The Presidential helicopter lands.  The President and his
     group are ushered over to AIR FORCE ONE which stands only
     hundred yard away.

     INT. AIR FORCE ONE - SAME

     The door OPENS and the President and his advisors rush in.
     David flops down into a seat, quickly flips open his laptop
     which reads: 00:05, 00:04...

     EXT. ROOFTOP - LOS ANGELES - SAME

     As the light amplifies, the believers chant, louder and
     louder.  Suddenly the white light DISAPPEARS.  The believers
     are stunned.  In a brief moment it is replaced with a BLAST.

     A DESTRUCTION BEAM BLASTS down onto the rooftop, splintering
     everything there, Police helicopter included, into a billion
     tiny particles.

     Tiffany is he epicenter, from here the WALL OF DESTRUCTION GROWS
     outwardly, destroying everything in its path.

     EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING -  SAME

     Just as the BLAST HITS, the historic building is DECIMATED.

     EXT. WHITE HOUSE LAWN -  SAME

     Alex shuts the door on a helicopter.  As he steps back the
     white light VANISHES.  He looks up as the BLAST replaces the
     beam.

     ANGLE - WHITE HOUSE

     Just as one of the helicopters pass us, the White House
     SPLINTERS BEFORE OUR EYES.

     EXT. ANDREWS - RUNWAY - AIR FORCE ONE - SAME

     Air Force One quickly taxis down the runway toward us.
     Behind them in the distance we can SEE the DESTRUCTIVE beam
     GROWING OUTWARDLY from the epicenter.

     THE CAPITOL BUILDING

     The WALL OF DESTRUCTION reaches the Capitol Building,
     fragmenting into a trillion particles.

     THE PENTAGON

     Washed under the WALL OF DESTRUCTION, the Pentagon, too, is
     blown to smithereens.

     INT. AIR FORCE ONE - SAME

     Thick with tension.  Everyone is white-knuckled, anxious for
     take off as they taxi quicky down the runway.

     EXT. ANDREWS - RUNWAY - AIR FORCE ONE

     Air Force one, full throttle.  It LIFTS OFF just in time to
     miss the WALL OF DESTRUCTION as it rips apart the airport
     behind them, dangerously close.

     WIDE ANGLES - WASHINGTON, D.C.

     We SEE the WAVE OF DESTRUCTION growing outwardly from the
     epicenter, ENGULFING ALL OF WASHINGTON.

     Air Force One is just barely making it out in time.

     EXT. PASADENA FREEWAY - SAME

     Jasmine's car is caught in traffic just outside the tunneled
     underpass at the Griffith Park Mountains.

     Suddenly the radio CUTS OUT.  Jasmine turns around and SEES...

     JASMINE'S POV - FREEWAY & DOWNTOWN

     Far off the devastation of downtown can be seen.  The WALL OF
     DESTRUCTION growing towards us.

     Reacting, Jasmine grabs Dylan and dashes out of the car.
     Boomer follows.  Every drivers who can, jumps out of their
     cars, running in all directions.

     Jasmine heads for the tunnel.

     ANGLE - FREEWAY

     The grid-locked cars have nowhere to run as the WALL OF
     DESTRUCTION grows out from downtown.  All the cars are WIPED
     OUT in a row, sitting ducks.

     ANGLE - OVERPASS - BRIDGES

     Packed with cars.  They're quickly demolished as the WALL OF
     DESTRUCTION blasts by.

     INT. TUNNEL - SAME

     Jasmine turns back from the tunnel entrance.

     JASMINE'S POV - WALL OF DESTRUCTION

     Ever nearing, only moments away.

     Jasmine spots an open MAINTENANCE ALCOVE deep within the
     tunnel.  She runs to it, puts Dylan inside and climbs in after
     him.

     Leaning back out, Jasmine looks for Boomer who stares at her,
     wagging his tail.

                                JASMINE
                Boomer, come.  Come boy!

     Boomer LEAPS inside and Jasmine ducks to the side of the WALL
     OF DESTRUCTION hits the tunnel entrance, cars are JAMMED
     TOGETHER, SMASHING into one another.

     Suddenly the car ARE BLOWN CLEAR THROUGH THE TUNNEL like so
     many toy Hot Wheel cars.

     Inside the Maintenance alcove, Jasmine shields Dylan and
     Boomer with her body.

     EXT. MANHATTAN - WIDE ANGLE - SAME

     From a distance we WATCH as all of Manhattan is consumed from
     its center outwardly by the growing WALL OF DESTRUCTION.
     Within seconds all of Manhattan is gone.

     The WALL OF DESTRUCTION reaches its outer most edges and fades
     away.

     The SCHISM under the craft slowly CLOSES.  The ship now hovers
     over a completely wiped out Manhattan.

                                                        SLOW DISSOLVE:

                left in ruins...

     Russell shoots a worried look over to Miguel.  Suddenly Troy
     moves up to the front on wobbly legs.

                                TROY
                Guys, I don't feel so good.

                                RUSSELL
                When was the last time you had
                your medicine?

                Four days... five?

     Troy looks really sick.  Miguel is shocked.

                                MIGUEL
                But I gave you some this morning.

                                TROY
                I didn't take it.  I thought I
                didn't need it anymore.

     EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - SAME

     The trailer, with Russell's Bi-wing in tow, pulls over.  Troy
     rushes out, vomiting on the side of the road.  Miguel comes to
     his aide.  Russell steps out and walks to the curve in the
     highway.

                                RUSSELL
                Miguel?  Come take a look at this.

     Reluctantly Miguel leaves his brother's side.

     Below an entire valley filled with campers, trailers and
     busses.  An instant refugee city, if you will, for as far as
     the eye can see.  Spectacular.

     INT. EL TORO - BRIEFING ROOM - MORNING

     Thirty-five pilots are being briefed by their Commanding
     Office, CAPTAIN WATSON who points to a fuzzy photograph of
     the craft over Los Angeles.

                                WATSON
                You will be the first wave in our
                counter attack.  Though
                surveillance satellite
                reconnaissance has been impaired,
                we have a fix on our primary
                target.

     Steve and Jimmy sit next to each other near the back of the
     room

                                STEVE
                     (whispered)
                You won't exactly need radar to
                find it.

     Jimmy chuckles.  Watson is annoyed.

                                WATSON
                You want to add something to this
                briefing, Lt. Hill?

     Steve smiles confidently.

                                STEVE
                Sorry, Sir.  Just real anxious to
                kick some alien ass.

     Everyone chuckles, including Captain Watson.

     INT. AIR FORCE ONE - SAME

     The President is deeply contemplative.  Constance sits down
     next to him.  She knows what he's thinking.

                                CONSTANCE
                You saved a lot of lives.

                                PRESIDENT
                I could have evacuated the cities
                hours ago.
                     (beat)
                You know, when I flew in the Gulf
                War everything is simple.  We
                knew what we had to do.  It's not
                simple anymore, Connie.  A lot of
                people died today.  How many
                didn't have to?

     Constance realizes there's no comforting him.  She supports
     him silently by being there.  General Grey comes over.

                                PRESIDENT
                Any news on my wife?

                                GENERAL GREY
                The helicopter never arrived at
                Nellis and there's been no radio
                contact.

     The news rocks the President.  They both know what that means.

                                GENERAL GREY (cont'd)
                The fighters are in the air.

     Whitmore nods and follows the General to the back of the
     plane.

     COMMAND CENTER - AIR FORCE ONE

     Military Command has been set up on Air Force One, a kind of
     flying NORAD.  Military and technical crew are seated at the
     controls.  Nimziki is already there.

                                GENERAL GREY
                All satellites, microwave and
                ground communications with the
                cities are gone.  We believe we're
                looking at a total loss.

     Maintaining his composure, the President looks up at the many
     tracking screens.

                                PRESIDENT
                Where are they?

     INT. AIR FORCE ONE - PASSENGER SECTION - SAME

     Air sick, David holds a "barf bag" as Moishe talks.

                                MOISHE
                It's Air Force One for crying out
                loud.  Still he gets sick?

                                DAVID
                Moishe, please, don't talk.

     Moishe pats his belly.

                                MOISHE
                Look at me, like a rock.  Good
                weather, bad, doesn't matter.
                     (motions with his hands)
                We can go up and down, back and
                forth, side to side...

     David can't take any more of this story and takes off running
     for the bathroom.

                                MOISHE
                What I say?

     Constance comes over, sits next to Moishe.

                                CONSTANCE
                He still gets air sick, huh?  In
                all of this I didn't get the
                chance to thank you two.

                                MOISHE
                Think nothing of it, Spanky.

     Constance smiles, corrects him.

                Spunky.  He told you about that?

                     (nods)
                All he could think about was
                getting to you.  There's still
                love there I think.

                                CONSTANCE
                     (sadly)
                Love was never our problem.

                                MOISHE
                All you need is love.  John
                Lennon.  Smart man.  Shot in the

     INT. STEVE'S FIGHTER - SAME

     Steve looks down, becomes worried.

                she got out of here before it
                happened.

     Steve nods absently.

     INT. AIR FORCE ONE - SAME

     The center F/A-18 on the radar map begins to FLASH yellow,
     just under its image.  We SEE a video display of its FLIR
     (forward-looking infrared) targeting system, locked on.

     EXT. STEVE'S FIGHTER - SAME

     An Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) DROPS
     down from the underbelly of the fighter, DARTING OFF.

     Radar targeted, the missile BANKS hard, adjusting.  We SEE it
     is joined by FOURTEEN other missiles, all rocketing towards
     their target.

     EXT. ALIEN SHIP - SECONDS LATER

     The missiles are headed straight for the alien ship.
     Suddenly about a quarter mile before they reach it, they
     EXPLODE, as though blown out of the sky.

     When the smoke clears we see there has been zero damage.

     INT. STEVE'S FIGHTER - SAME

                Command, Eagle One.  Switching to
                "sidewinders."  We're moving in.

     EXT. SKIES - SAME

     In unison these amazing birds DIVE together, realigning
     themselves into six groups of five, spreading out to attack
     different areas of the ship.

     STEVE'S GROUP

     The first attack group, Steve's, are the first to near the
     colossal alien craft. Simultaneously they drop their AIM-9
     sidewinder missiles.

     PACK OF AIM-9 SIDEWINDER MISSILES

     They reach the same quarter-mile proximity and EXPLODE.

     INT. STEVE'S FIGHTER - SAME

                                STEVE
                They must have some kind of
                protective shield surrounding
                their hull.  Pull up.

     Most of the fighters do, but one is too late and SMASHES into
     the ship's protective shield.

     EXT. SKIES - SAME

     Steve's squadron BANKS hard, skirting the edge of the ship's
     protective shield.

     As the fighters approach, the alien ship's enormous ATTACK BAY
     doors OPEN.  Suddenly DOZENS OF ALIEN ATTACKERS dart out
     towards our fighters.

                                STEVE
                     (filtered)
                Evasive maneuvers!  Check Six!

     Just moving away in time, our Fighters barely dodge the
     oncoming enemy Attackers as they FIRE a HAILSTORM of FIREPOWER
     (tracker bullet-like lasers) showering the sky.

     As Steve's plane DIVES, an Attacker follows.  Jimmy's plane
     pulls up behind the attacker.

     HEADS UP DISPLAY - HUD

     Jimmy's HUD has the alien attacker in his sights.

                     (filtered)
                Got you covered, Stevie.

     Jimmy FIRES, another AIM-9 Sidewinder TAKES OFF.

     ALIEN ATTACKER

     The Sidewinder overtakes the attacker as Steve ROLLS AWAY out
     of position.  Five yards before the sidewinder can get to the
     Attacker, it EXPLODES.

                                JIMMY
                     Shit!  They've got shield too.

     STEVE'S FIGHTER

     Banks back around to get a shot.  Just as he turns, three
     American Fighters are BLOWN TO RIBBONS from Attacker tracer
     fire.

     The Attackers are in hot pursuit of Jimmy's fighter.  The
     Fighter flying next to Jimmy is DEMOLISHED.

                                STEVE
                Jimmy, roll right.  I'll cover.

     Jimmy's fighter narrowly rolls away from the tracer fire as
     Steve fires another Sidewinder, momentarily distracting the
     Attacker.

     Jimmy falls in line with Steve as the attackers turn on them.
     Both fighters jerk downwards at a ninety degree angle at MACH
     ONE.  Narrowly missing the ground, they bank away.  The
     Attackers can't follow.

     INT. AIR FORCE ONE - SAME

     Fighter after fighter begin to disappear from the display
     screens.

                                CONSTANCE
                We're losing them.

                                PRESIDENT
                Then get them out of there.

     Suddenly one of the large radar display maps FIZZLES OUT.

                                TECHNICIAN
                We've lost the satellite.

     Before he can adjust, another monitor FIZZLES AWAY.

     EXT. LOS ANGELES - SAME

     One by one we SEE the fighters getting TAKEN OUT.  Fireballs
     litter the laser-tracer fire covered skies.

                                STEVE
                Maybe we can out run them.  Follow
                my lead.

     Jimmy and Steve bank away from the craft, hit the supercruise,
     BOLTING AWAY at Mach 2.

     Both  Jimmy and Steve are held tight against their seats,
     straining against the G-Force.

     Two Attackers spot them and follow in hot pursuit.

     Steve and Jimmy are flying at breakneck speeds, the attackers
     slowly gaining on them.

                                STEVE
                Jimmy, kick it!  They're gaining.

                                JIMMY
                We're already over Mach 2!

                                STEVE
                So push it!

     Readouts show the  planes flying beyond measurement.

     INT. JIMMY'S FIGHTER - SAME

     As the  planes accelerate, Jimmy fights to remain conscious.

                Stevie... I can't...

                                STEVE
                Jimmy, stay with me.

     Jimmy slowly loses consciousness.  His fighter slows, drifting
     off to the right.

                                STEVE
                JIMMY!

     ALIEN ATTACKERS

     gain on them.  One catches up with Jimmy's fighter and FIRES.

     JIMMY'S FIGHTER

     Laser-tracers SHOWER the Fighter.  It EXPLODES.  Job done, his
     Attacker banks away, returning to Los Angeles.

                                STEVE
                No!!!!

     Steve's Attacker stays right with him, slowly gaining.  Steve
     kicks his harder, keeping the distance.

     A dozen PILOTS race out onto the field, running for their
     planes.  Before anyone can reach them, the sky darkens with
     ALIEN ATTACKERS who STRAFE the runway.

     INT. TOWER - SAME

     Through the front glass of the tower we SEE the Attackers
     firing.  One fires directly at the tower.  Watson DIVES for
     cover as everything around him erupts into a gigantic
     FIREBALL.

     The entire base goes up in flames.

     STEVE'S POV - THE GRAND CANYON - SAME

     Steve HITS THE BRAKES.  Surprised, the Attacker SAILS PAST.

     Taking the moment, Steve DIVES down INTO THE GRAND CANYON.

                                STEVE
                     (to himself)
                Okay, jerk-off.  Let's have some
                fun.

     The Attacker recovers, dives after Steve who flies dangerously
     close to the canyon walls.  The Attacker has trouble keeping
     up with him but does.

     Steve puts on a clinic in advanced aerobatics, banking,
     diving, swerving.

     The Attacker seems to be improving, following closer and
     closer.

     Steve ducks into smaller canyons, twisting sideways.  Still
     the Attacker follows close.

     FUEL GAUGE - RUNNING LOW

     Near empty.  Frustrated, Steve gets pissed.

                                STEVE
                Damn it!

     Steve turns down a dead and side canyon.  The Attacker is
     right on his tail.

                                STEVE
                Let's see if you're fully
                equipped.

     The Fighter is on a collision course with the end of the
     canyon wall.  Suddenly Steve yanks his ACES II - EJECTION
     SEAT.

     Stave SAILS UPWARDS into the air.

     The Fighter CRASHES into the canyon wall.

     The Attacker can't turn in time.  He tries to pull up, over
     it, just misses the top of the canyon wall.

     As the nose of the Attacker hits the tip of the canyon wall
     the Attacker is FLIPPED OVER, ROLLING END OVER END over the
     top of the canyon.

     The parachute on Steve's ejection seat pops OPEN.

     EXT. TOP OF CANYON - CONTINUOUS

     Rolling end over end, the Attacker is banged up BADLY as it
     finally comes to a stop.

     Not far away, Steve has a quick, hard, landing.  Rolling over,
     Steve quickly pops the buckles on the chute and frees himself.

     He stands and looks around.  Spotting the beat up and
     incapacitated alien Attacker, Steve gets an angry resolved
     look.  He marches over to the fallen alien Attacker.  He scans
     it quickly, spots a type of door that has been knocked ajar.

     With all his might, Steve YANKS the door OPEN.

     AN ALIEN

     For the first time we get a quick glance at these aliens, an
     odd hybrid creature with fluctuating skeletal structure.

     The reason we only get a quick glance is because the moment it
     turns woozily towards us, Steve rears back and SLUGS HIM IN
     THE FACE, knocking the alien totally unconscious.

     His anger finally subsiding, exhaustion taking over, Steve
     stands over the craft, slowly withdrawing the prized Victory
     Dance cigar.  He lights it and takes a long angry puff.

                                STEVE
                Now that's a close encounter.

     Jasmine rushes over to a phone but the line is dead.  Taking
     Dylan by the hand she moves to the large garage doors but she
     can't open them.

     She turns around and see a large maintenance truck, a huge
     land-mover shovel attached to the front.  She smiles.

                                RUSSELL
                We should leave too.

                our on board computers?

     The Technician nods and exits.  Defeated, the President slumps
     sullenly.

                                GENERAL GREY
                We've moved as many of our forces
                away from the bases as possible
                but we've already sustained heavy
                losses.

     The President nods his approval absently.  Coming out of the
     bathroom, David overhears.

                                NIMZIKI
                I spoke with the Joint Chief when
                they arrived at NORAD.  They
                agree, we must launch a counter
                offensive with a full nuclear
                strike.  Hit 'em with everything
                we've got.

                                PRESIDENT
                Above American soil?

                                NIMZIKI
                If we don't strike soon, there may
                not be much of an America left to
                defend.

     The Technician returns, his face is white with fear.

                                GENERAL GREY
                What's the latest from NORAD?

                                OFFICER
                It's gone, sir.  They've taken out
                NORAD.

                                NIMZIKI
                That's impossible...

                                GENERAL GREY
                My God, the Vice President and the
                Joint Chiefs...

                                NIMZIKI
                Mr. President, we must launch.  A
                delay now would be more costly
                than when you waited to evacuate
                the cities!

     That stings the President.  He considers the option.  David is
     shocked.

                                DAVID
                You can't be seriously considering
                firing nuclear weapons?

                                CONSTANCE
                David, don't...

     David pushes past her.

                                DAVID
                If you fire nukes, so will the
                rest of the world.  Do you know
                what that kind of fall out will
                do?  How many innocent people...

     The General gets up running interference.  Constance tries to
     pull David back.

                                GENERAL GREY
                     (stern)
                Sir, i remind you that you are
                just a guest here...

                                CONSTANCE
                     (overlapping)
                David, please...

                                DAVID
                This is insanity!  You'll kill us
                and them at the same time.
                There'll be nothing left!

                                NIMZIKI
                     (interrupting)
                Sit down and shut up!

     Suddenly Moishe is on his feet, interrupting.

                                MOISHE
                Don't tell him to shut up!  You'd
                all be dead, were it not for my
                David.  You didn't do anything to
                prevent this!

     As everyone is about to besiege Moishe, the President tries to
     calm him down.

                                PRESIDENT
                Sir, there wasn't much more we
                could have done.  We were totally
                unprepared for this.

                                MOISHE
                Don't give me unprepared!  Since
                nineteen fifty whatever you guys
                have had that space ship, the
                thing you found in New Mexico.

                                DAVID
                     (embarrassed)
                Dad, please...

                                MOISHE
                What was it, Roswell?  You had the
                space ship, the bodies, everything
                locked up in a bunker, the what is
                it, Area fifty one.  That's it!
                Area fifty one.  You knew and you
                didn't do nothing!

     For the first time in along time, President Whitmore smiles.

                                PRESIDENT
                Regardless of what the tabloids
                have said, there were never any
                space crafts recovered by the
                government.  Take my word for it,
                there is no Area 51 and no
                recovered space ship.

     Chief of Staff Nimziki suddenly clears his throat.

                                NIMZIKI
                Uh, excuse me, Mr. President, but
                that's not entirely accurate.

     The President and General Grey turn to Nimziki, shocked.

     SMASHED AND BURNED OUT CARS

     laying across the roadway.  Suddenly SMASH, Jasmine's
     maintenance truck BLASTS through.

     EXT. HIGHWAY - CITY LIMITS - SAME

     With the massive devastation in the b.g., Jasmine drives the
     maintenance truck down the highway.  In the back, the few
     survivors she's found.

     In the back, four INJURED PASSENGERS lay across the flatbed as
     a thin, older man, TEDDY tends to them.

     INT. MAINTENANCE TRUCK - SAME

     Jasmine spots a TALL MAN, his closes in tatters RUNNING down
     the highway, his arms in the air.

                                TALL MAN
                The end has come!  He speaketh
                his word and the end hast come!

     Jasmine pulls up along side him.

                                JASMINE
                Hop on.  We're heading out to El
                Toro.

                                TALL MAN
                You cannot defy what has come, it
                is the end!

     The tall man moves off, screaming to the heavens.  As Jasmine
     watches him drift away she SEES...

     OVERTURNED MILITARY HELICOPTER

     Still smoldering from the crash.  A woman can be seen inside,
     still alive.  Jasmine jumps out.

                                JASMINE
                Give me a hand.

     Teddy joins Jasmine as they pry open the door.  Inside, the
     pilots have been killed, but Mrs. Whitmore, THE FIRST LADY,
     lays there in great pain, blood across her blouse.

                                JASMINE
                Let's get her out of here.

     They erase her from the wreckage, laying her on the
     ground.  Dylan comes over, standing next to his mother.

                                TEDDY
                She's bleeding pretty bad.

     Suddenly we HEAR the CLICKING of a rifle COCKING.

                                MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                Who's got the key?

     Jasmine turns and see a REDNECK leveling his rifle at her.
     Behind him a small damaged sports car pulls up, packed to the
     gills with stolen, looted appliances.

                                REDNECK
                     (yelling to pals)
                Looks like I've solved our
                transportation problem.

                                JASMINE
                Hey, you're welcome to come with
                us.  We're leaving here anyway...

                                REDNECK
                We're not.  Give me the key.
                     (yelling back)
                Get 'em off.

     Two GUYS rush from their vehicle over to the maintenance
     truck, pulling the injured off the tailback.

                                TALL MAN (O.S.)
                Repent!  Sinners!  Repent!  The
                end hast come!

     Running up from behind, the Tall Man comes over screaming.
     The Redneck turns his gun on him.

                                REDNECK
                Back off.  This ain't your
                business.

     As the Redneck is distracted, Jasmine spots the bag of
     fireworks protruding out of Dylan's back pocket.

                                TALL MAN
                You cannot go against the word,
                brother.

                                REDNECK
                Sure I can.

     The Redneck SHOOTS the Tall Man.  His buddies laugh.

                                REDNECK (cont'd)
                Now give me that key, bitch.

     As he turns back to Jasmine, Boomer starts BARKING wildly.
     Just as he turns to shoot the dog, Jasmine lights a key ROCKET
     from the fireworks bag.  The rocket BLASTS into the Redneck,
     his shirt IGNITING ON FIRE.

     The Redneck drops the rifle, attempting to put out the flames,
     his cronies rush to his aid.  Jasmine picks up the gun, moves
     in on them.

                                JASMINE
                This "bitch" was born in  Alabama
                with a Daddy who loved to hunt.
                     (cocking the weapon)
                So don't think for one second that
                I don't know how to use this.

     She FIRES the rifle.  Quickly the rednecks scamper away.

                                             CUT TO:

     EXT. DRY LAKE - DESERT - LATER

     Dragging a heavy bundle wrapped in his parachute, Steve
     marches across the desert floor.  The alien ARM/TENTACLE
     dangles out of the parachute.

     Exhausted, Steve stops to wipe his brow.  He hears something,
     turns around.

     STEVE'S POV - THE TRAILER ARMADA

     Several hundred of the trailers from the refugee camp are
     headed en mass towards him.  Smiling, Steve signals them.

     The trailers pull up on either side, surrounding him.  Miguel
     leans out of his trailer.

                                MIGUEL
                     (sarcastic)
                Need a lift?

                                STEVE
                When I flew overhead, I saw some
                kind of base, not far.

     Confused, Miguel checks his map.

                                MIGUEL
                It's not on the map.

                                STEVE
                Trust me, it's there.

     EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - LATER

     Flying over the desert, Air Force One sails over an immense
     valley, Area 51 below - hangars, a few buildings, a small air
     strip, not much.

     Super: N.I.A. Base - "Area 51", Nevada

     EXT. RUNWAY - LATER

     Air Force One lands.  Wheels touch down, skid.

     INT. HANGAR - LATER

     The large hangar doors open and Air Force One is rolled
     inside.  The President and his entourage are met by a
     contingent of base personnel led by field operative, LT.
     MITCHELL.  He escorts them to a side hallway.

     INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

     Lt. Mitchell walks over to an odd wall switch as the President
     and his entourage wait in the center of the hall.  With a loud
     hydraulic HUM, the entire hallway begins to SINK DOWN, an
     enormous ELEVATOR.

                                PRESIDENT
                Why the hell wasn't I told about
                this place?

                                NIMZIKI
                Two words, Mr. President.
                Plausible deniability.

     General Grey shoots Nimziki a pissed off look.  When the
     elevator stops, a door SLIDES open.

     INT. RESEARCH FACILITIES - CONTINUOUS

     Stepping out of the elevator, they walk into a large state of
     the art, sterile clean research facility.  It is amazingly
     well staffed and organized.

                                PRESIDENT
                I don't understand.  Where did all
                this come from?  How did this get
                funded?

                                MOISHE
                You didn't think they actually
                spent ten thousand dollars for a
                hammer and thirty thousand for a
                toilet seat, did you?

     The President shoots him a look.  They are greeted by a group
     of SCIENTISTS in whit coats led by, DR. OKUN.

                                MITCHELL
                Mr. President, I'd like to
                introduce you to Dr. Okun.  He's
                been heading up our research here
                for the last fifteen years.

     Dr. Okun is an odd, hyper-energetic man who's spent too much
     time in isolation.

                                OKUN
                Mr. President, a real pleasure.
                They don't let us out much, you
                you.

                                PRESIDENT
                     (uncomfortable)
                Yes.

                                OKUN
                Well, I guess you'd like to see
                the big tamale?  Follow me.

     They walk up a ramp at the end of the room.  Large heavily
     enforced doors SLIDE open.

     INT. STORAGE LAB - CONTINUOUS

     The group steps inside and nearly gasps at...

     THE ALIEN ATTACKER

     Just like the one that chased Steve.  The entourage stares in
     horror and wonder.  We can SEE the patch-work repairs they've
     made on the ship over the years.

                                OKUN
                She's a beaut, ain't she?

     Moishe leans close to David and Constance.

                                MOISHE
                     (smug)
                Never any space ships recovered by
                the government, huh?

                                PRESIDENT
                We've had this for forty years and
                you don't know anything about
                them?

                                OKUN
                Hell no, we know tons about them.
                The nearest stuff has only
                happened in the last few days.

     The President slowly walks around the ship as Okun talks.
     David, mouth agape, just stares at it.

                                OKUN (cont'd)
                See, we can't duplicate their type
                of power so we've never been able
                to experiment.  But since these
                guys started showing up, all the
                gizmos inside turned on.  The last
                twenty four hours have been really
                exciting!

                                PRESIDENT
                     (exploding)
                People are dying out there.  I
                don't think "exciting" is the word
                I'd choose to describe it!

     The room goes silent, letting the President blow off steam.

                                PRESIDENT
                     (calming)
                What can you tell us about the
                enemy we're facing?

                                OKUN
                Not all too dissimilar to us.
                Breathes oxygen, comparable
                tolerances to heat,
                cold...probably why they're
                interested in our planet.
                     (suddenly excited)
                Hey, you wanna see them?

     INT. MEDICAL RESEARCH VAULT - MOMENTS LATER

     The lights slowly TURN ON, illuminated the vault.  Okun leads
     the group to a sealed partition.

                                OKUN
                This is vault, or as some of us
                have come to call it, the "freak
                show."

     Okun hits a switch and the sealed partition lifts revealing...

     FORMALDEHYDE TANKS - ALIENS

     Three dead aliens float in the milky formaldehyde tanks.  The
     murky fluid and condensation obstructs our view.  What we do
     see is not pretty.

                                OKUN
                When we found them they were
                wearing bio-mechanical suits.
                Once we got them off, we were able
                to learn a great deal about their
                anatomy; eyes, ears, bipolar
                digestive system... no vocal cords
                though.  We're assuming they
                communicate with each other
                through other means.

     David cannot contain his fascination.  He steps forward.

                                DAVID
                What kind of other means?  Hand
                signals, body language?

                                OKUN
                Some kind of extra sensory
                perception.  Telepathy.

                                PRESIDENT
                Can they be killed?

                                OKUN
                These three died in the crash.
                Their bodies are as frail as our
                own.  You just have to get past
                their technology, which is, I'm
                sorry to say, far more advanced.

     The President turns to David.

                                PRESIDENT
                You unlocked a part of that
                technology.  You cracked their
                code.

                                DAVID
                All I did was stumble onto their
                signal.  I don't know how helpful
                I can be...

                                PRESIDENT
                Show them what you've discovered.
                Work together.  We've got to find
                a way to beat them.

     EXT. SECURITY GATE - SAME

     Four armed GUARDS watch the gate.  An armada of trucks and
     trailers heads right for them.  They move into position to
     block their entrance as a blue pick-up skids to a halt before
     them.  Steve stands up from the back of the pick up.

                                GUARD
                Sorry, Lt. Colonel, I can't open
                the gates without clearance.

                                STEVE
                You want to see my clearance?

     Impatiently Steve grabs the Guard by the collar, pulling him
     over the side of the truck putting him face to face with the
     bundled parachute in the flatbed.  Steve rips the fabric aside
     revealing...

     THE ALIEN CREATURE

     Still unconscious, the alien stirs.  The Guard JUMPS BACK,
     shitting in his pants.  Quickly he signals for the other to
     open the gate.

     The armada quickly drives past.

     BLACKNESS

     Total darkness.  Suddenly light pours in as a  door is open.
     We see the faces of Okun, David and three technicians all
     peering at us with inquisitive expressions.

                                OKUN
                See the gizmos flashing?

     REVERSE - INSIDE ALIEN CRAFT

     Sure enough, tons of gizmos with lights flashing.  High tech
     meets organic organisms.  This alien ship looks familiar to
     our own technology and completely different at the same time.

                                OKUN (cont'd)
                We've been working around the
                clock trying to get a fix on all
                this crap.  Some stuff we figured
                out right away.

     David climbs in, fascinated.  He touches everything.  Okun
     points to everything as he describes it.

                                OKUN (cont'd)
                This thing we're pretty sure is
                the life support for the cabin,
                this do-hickey over here is
                connected with the engines, this
                crap...we have no idea what that
                stuff is for.

     David is transfixed by it.  He stares at the small screens
     with flashing light patterns on them.

                                OKUN (cont'd)
                But this over here is clearly what
                they use to navigate and guide the
                craft.

     But David still stares at the small screens.

                                DAVID
                Someone grab my laptop for me?

     One of the technicians rushes off as Okun leans close.

                                OKUN
                Find something interesting?

                                DAVID
                Maybe.

     The technician hands David his retrieved laptop which he
     quickly flips open and turns on.

                                DAVID
                These patterns here, they're
                repeating sequentially, just
                like...

     David turns his laptop around for Okun to see.  The pattern on
     David's laptop flashes identically as the alien screen.

                                DAVID (cont'd)
                ...their countdown signal.  Their
                using this frequency for computer
                communications.  It's how they co-
                ordinate their ships.

                                OKUN
                You know, you're really starting
                to make us look bad.

     The two men exchange a smile.  Another TECHY pops his head
     inside.

                                TECHY
                     (out of breath)
                They got one!  They got one,
                alive!

     INT. HALLWAY OFF MAIN HANGAR - AREA 51 - SAME

     The bundled alien lays on a stretcher that's wheeled quickly
     into the hall.  Okun and his staff surround it.  Trailing
     behind them is Steve, Russell and Miguel.

                                OKUN
                How long has it been unconscious?

                                RUSSELL
                Excuse me Doctor...

                                STEVE
                Three hours.

                                OKUN
                Get him into containment, stat.

                                RUSSELL
                My boy is very sick, he needs
                immediate attention.

     Okun ignores Russell, hitting the elevator switch on the wall,
     the room begins its hydraulic HUM.

                                OKUN
                He's dying out.  I want him
                sprayed down with saline.

     Russell SLAMS his fist against the switch, the room stops.  He
     GRABS a doctor nearby, gets in his face.

                                RUSSELL
                My boys is slipping into a diabetic
                coma.  If you don't do something
                about it right now he will die.

     Miguel is surprised and proud of Russell as he holds DOCTOR
     ISAACS, meaning business.

                                DR. ISAACS
                O'Haver, Miller, come with me.
                     (to Russell)
                Take us to him.

                                                        CUT TO:

     EXT. ROAD - MAINTENANCE TRUCK - NIGHT

     Headlights pierce the darkness as the maintenance truck rolls
     to a stop.  Jasmine climbs down out of the truck, her face
     ashen.

     She walks past a sign reading: El Toro Marine Corps Air
     Station.  Tears begin to roll from her eyes.  We follow her
     gaze to see...

     EXT. EL TORO MARINE CORPS AIR STATION - CONTINUOUS

     The entire facility is smoldering, the last remnants of the
     fire burning itself to extinction.  Jasmine is devastated.

                                                        CUT TO:

     INT. AREA 51 COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT

     General Grey and Nimziki are in a heated argument.

                                GENERAL GREY
                You were the head of the National
                Intelligence Agency!  You knew all
                about this.  When were you
                planning on informing the rest of
                us!?

                                NIMZIKI
                It had been deemed classified.

                                GENERAL GREY
                Christ, why didn't you say
                anything about this when they
                first arrived?  You could have
                warned us before we launched a
                counter attack that cost us
                hundreds of American pilots!

     Just then the President enters along with Constance and some
     other ADVISORS.  He examines a paper map of the United States,
     tacked to the wall, each major city circled in black.

                                PRESIDENT
                Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia,
                destroyed?

                                GENERAL GREY
                     (composing himself)
                And there are scattered reports of
                sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth,
                And Memphis.

     The President and his team take seats at the large conference
     table.

                                GENERAL GREY (cont'd)
                We've learned that NATO and
                western allied installations were
                the firs to be taken out.  We
                were next.  They knew exactly where
                and how to hit us.

     Grey sneaks an accusatory glare at Nimziki.

                                PRESIDENT
                And our forces?

                                GENERAL GREY
                We're down to approximately
                fifteen percent, Sir.
                     (beat)
                If you calculate the time it takes
                them to destroy a city and move
                on, we're looking at world wide
                destruction of every major city
                within the next thirty six hours.

                                PRESIDENT
                We're being exterminated.

     The room is quiet.  Constance runs her fingers through her
     hair.  The door to the room opens and Lt. Mitchell enters with
     Steve.

                                MITCHELL
                Mr. President, this is Lt.
                Colonel Steven Hill.

     The President quickly gets to his feet, anxiously shaking
     Steve's hand.

                                PRESIDENT
                Lieutenant, congratulations.

                                STEVE
                Thank you, sir.

                                PRESIDENT
                Where is the prisoner now?

                                MITCHELL
                We have him in isolation.  The
                doctors are very hopeful he will
                survive.

                                PRESIDENT
                I'd like to see him.

                                MITCHELL
                Yes, sir.

     The General is concerned but the President is determined.
     They head for the door.

                                STEVE
                     (to General Grey)
                General, I'm anxious to get back
                to El Toro.

                                GENERAL GREY
                Didn't anyone tell you?  I'm
                sorry.  El Toro was destroyed in
                the attack.

     Steve is shattered, he had no idea.

                                                        CUT TO:

     EXT. EL TORO BASE - NIGHT

     The injured are gathered around a small camp fire.  Jasmine
     walks up, dumping a box full of charred can goods.

                                JASMINE
                These should last us a while.

     As Margaret tries to move, she winces in pain.  Jasmine rushes
     to her aid.  The color from her face drained, Margaret looks
     like she's taking a turn for the worse.

                                JASMINE
                Don't move.  Stay still.

     Jasmine adjusts the bandages as Margaret turns and see Dylan
     curled up next to Boomer, too adorable.  Slowly he starts to
     wake up.

                                MARGARET
                Your son.

                                JASMINE
                He's my angel.

                                MARGARET
                Was his father stationed here?

                                JASMINE
                He wasn't his father.  I was kinda
                hoping he'd want the job, though.

     Jasmine becomes sad, remembering.  Margaret changes the
     subject.

                                MARGARET
                So, what do yo do for a living?

                                JASMINE
                I'm a dancer.

                                MARGARET
                Really?  Ballet?

                                JASMINE
                     (laughs)
                No.  Exotic.

                                MARGARET
                Oh.  Sorry.

                                JASMINE
                Don't be.  I'm not.  It's good
                money.
                     (re: Dylan)
                'Side, he's worth it.

     The bandages changed, Jasmine sits down next to Margaret.

                                MARGARET
                And when the dancing's over?  What
                about your future?

                                JASMINE
                Funny, it used to scare me when I
                thought about the future.
                     (looking around)
                Guess it doesn't really matter
                anymore.

     Dylan comes walking over.

                                JASMINE
                Dylan, come here.  I want you to
                meet the First Lady.

                                MARGARET
                     (surprised)
                I thought you didn't recognize me.

                                JASMINE
                Didn't want to say anything.  I
                voted for the other guy.

     INT. CONTAINMENT LAB - NIGHT

     Okun and two Medical assistants examine the alien creature.
     His arms and chest have been strapped down to the examining
     table.

     For the first time we get a good look at the head of this
     creature, long tentacled-type cords interlocked, covering the
     face.  The doctors attach clamps to each of the cords.

                                OKUN
                Everyone ready?

     The doctors exchange nervous glances, nod to each other.  At
     the same moment all they pull on the clamps, unraveling the
     interlocked cords.  As the cords unravel, we SEE that this is
     in fact a bio-mechanical SUIT as we REVEAL...

     THE ALIEN

     Beneath the cords lay the unconscious face of the alien, his
     skin translucent, his body fluids, capillaries, muscle tissue,
     alien's skin.

                                OKUN
                Do we have life support monitors
                recording?

                                MED ASSIST #2
                Yes.  If we fuck up it'll all be
                on tape.

                                OKUN
                Can we get some ventilation in
                here?  I can't take this smell.

                                MED ASSIST #2
                They've conquered space travel but
                not b.o.

     As Okun begins to put on a pair of surgical gloves he suddenly
     grabs his forehead.

                                MED ASSIST #1
                You all right?

                                OKUN
                Yeah.  It's just that stink gives
                me a headache.

                                MED ASSIST #2
                He's moving!

     Instantly everyone's attention is riveted to the arm of the
     alien as it moves beneath the sheet.  Unseen by the others the
     alien creature's EYES OPEN.

     Another SHARP PAIN hits Okun who SCREAMS, stumbling backwards
     grabbing his head.  The others turn in surprise.

     THE ALIEN

     Suddenly SPRINGS up, the restraining straps SNAPPING.  Before
     Med #2 can react, one of the alien's tentacles SMASHES her
     across the face.  She is sent sprawling backwards.

     LOW ANGLE - THE ALIEN

     Standing before her.  In a wink of an eye, he ATTACKS, leaping
     on her.

     Together they TUMBLE back into a formaldehyde tank.  Hoses
     are ripped from their sides and STEAM pours out.  We get quick
     glimpse of their struggle as the steam engulfs them.

     INT. HALLWAY - SAME

     Mitchell leads the Presidential party down the hall.  They
     turn and enter the Medical lab.

     INT. CONTAINMENT LAB - CONTINUOUS

     The group slows as they enter the room.  They see the
     containment room through the glass is covered with white
     steam.  Nothing can be seen.  It's eerily quiet.

     Cautiously they approach.  Suddenly Okun is SLAMMED AGAINST
     the glass partition, the creature's tentacles wrapped around
     him.  Pressed firmly to the glass, his eyes are shut, his
     expression pained, but when he speaks the voice is angry.

                                OKUN/ALIEN
                Release...me.

                                MITCHELL
                Open the door.  Get him out of
                there.

     Suspicious, General Grey stops him.

                                GENERAL GREY
                Wait.
                     (to Okun)
                Can you hear me?

                                OKUN/ALIEN
                Will kill...release me.  Now!

     They follow the tentacles with their eyes, up to the ceiling
     of the containment tank.  Suddenly the alien LEAPS DOWN,
     startling them, landing before them behind the glass.

     We see he's holding Okun against the glass, speaking THROUGH
     HIM.  This is the first real good look we get at the this bizarre
     creature.  Everyone in the room is repulsed and compelled by
     it at the same time.

     EXT. AREA 51 - NIGHT

     Through the hundreds of campers and trailers parked outside,
     Steve runs past until he reaches the open tarmac.

     A transport helicopter sits on the edge of the landing area.
     Steve runs up to it and climbs inside.

     INT. TRANSPORT HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

     Steve quickly starts it engines, preparing to take off.  A
     SOLDIER rushes over to the cockpit.

                                SOLIDER
                     (yelling)
                What the hell are you doing?  Get
                out of there!

                                STEVE
                I'm just going to borrow it.

     The Soldier pulls out his pistol, taking aim.

                                SOLIDER
                No you're not, sir.

                                STEVE
                You really want to shoot me?

     Steve stares the Soldier down.  Reluctantly he lowers his gun.

                                SOLDIER
                Shit.  I'm gonna catch the hell for
                this.

     Steve smiles and gives him a quick salute then TAKES OFF.
     Quickly the bird RISES UP and darts off into the night.

     INT. MEDICAL LAB - SAME

     The President has moved closer to the glass and is talking
     with the alien.  The alien uses Okun like a ventriloquist's
     dummy.

                                PRESIDENT
                Why did you people come here?

                                OKUN/ALIEN
                Air...water...your "sun."

                                PRESIDENT
                Where do your people come from?
                     (no answer)
                Where is your home?

                                OKUN/ALIEN
                Here...now.

                                PRESIDENT
                And before here?

                                OKUN/ALIEN
                Many worlds...

                                PRESIDENT
                Can we negotiate a truce?  is
                there room for co-existance?
                     (no answer)
                Can there be peace between us?

                                OKUN/ALIEN
                Peace?  No peace.

                                PRESIDENT
                What do you want us to do?

                                OKUN/ALIEN
                Die.

     The Alien moves closer to the glass staring at the President.
     Suddenly the President clutches his head in pain.

                                NIMZIKI
                Mr. President?

                                OKUN/ALIEN
                We kill you...all.

     The pain becomes more severe and the President SCREAM OUT.
     There is general panic as people rush to the President's side.

                                GENERAL GREY
                     (to Mitchell)
                Is that glass bullet proof?

                                MITCHELL
                No sir.

     The General draws his pistol.  Mitchell and the other military
     officers follow his lead.  Simultaneously they all begin to
     FIRE!

     The glass SHATTERS into a billion pieces.  The Alien is cut to
     ribbons, falling backwards.

     The President collapses.  So does Okun.  A STAFFER rushes over
     to Okun, checks his pulse.

                                STAFFER
                He's dead.

     General Grey moves to the President who slowly recovers.

                                GENERAL GREY
                Mr. President, are you okay?

     Woozily the President sits up, a strange look in his eye.

                                PRESIDENT
                He wanted me to understand.  He
                communicated with me.
                     (turning to Grey)
                They're like locusts.  They travel
                from planet to planet, their whole
                civilization.  After they've
                consumed every natural resource
                they move on.  And we're next.

     The President stands with a new resolve.  He stares at the
     dead alien on the floor.

                                PRESIDENT
                     (cold)
                Prepare a nuclear strike.

     INT. STORAGE LAB - MINUTES LATER

     The research staff are working near the recovered alien
     attacker.  Constance comes rushing in.  She looks around for
     David.  Through the glass of one of the offices she sees him.

     INT. OFFICES - CONTINUOUS

     Holding a bottle of Jack Daniels, David fishes through a small
     refrigerator as Constance enters.

                                DAVID
                Just my luck, no ice.

                                CONSTANCE
                I take it you've heard.

                                DAVID
                A toast to the end of the world.

     David toasts her with the bottle, takes a swig.

                                CONSTANCE
                He didn't come to this decision
                lightly.

     David nods, he doesn't want to argue.  He smiles cynically.

                                DAVID
                You still believe in him.

                                CONSTANCE
                He's a good man.

                                DAVID
                Better be.  You left me for him.

                                CONSTANCE
                I wanted a career.  Didn't you
                ever want to be part of something
                special?

     David stares daggers at her.

                                DAVID
                I was part of something special.

     Constance realizes he means their marriage.  She's hurt him
     and can see it.  She turns and leaves.

                                                        CUT TO:

     EXT. DARK SKIES - NIGHT

     A black shadow is vaguely seen in the dark night.  As we pass
     some moonlit clouds we recognize the shadow is, in fact, a B-2
     STEALTH BOMBER.

     As we WIDEN, we see that the bomber is part of a squadron of
     eight.  These mighty winged giants fly together in attack
     formation.

     INT. COMMAND CENTER - ARE 51 - SAME

     A tracking screen comes to life, eight blips flashing.

                Who will we reach first?

                                COMMANDER
                Houston, Texas.  Intercept ETA,
                six minutes and counting down.

                                PRESIDENT
                Oh my God, Houston.

                                GENERAL GREY
                The major cities have been
                deserted.  Civilian casualties
                should be at a minimum, sir.

     One map screen, ENLARGES, tracking the bomber on route to
     Houston.

     EXT. LIQUOR STORE - OUTSIDE HOUSTON - NIGHT

     Looters take all they can carry through the broken glass store
     front.  A large heavily armored TANK rolls up front.

                Target is locked, sir.  Do you
                wish to deploy?

     Everyone turns to the President who does not answer.

                                GENERAL GREY
                Mr. President, do you wish to
                deploy.

     Still there is no answer.
                                NIMZIKI

     The bay doors open and a large Tactical Nuclear Cruise Missile

     The bomber BANKS AWAY.

     On the big map we see one FLASHING target line tracking the

     The targeting map shows how close the missile is, nearly on
     top of the target.  Everyone in the room holds their breath.

     WIDE ANGLE - HOUSTON

     With the B-2 Stealth Bomber in the foreground, the city behind
     it vanishes in a FLASH OF LIGHT, blinding us.

                It's a hit!

     The others are still waiting.  The monitor shows the night

     General Grey shoots Nimziki a look.  The President holds up a
     hand, silencing the room.

                                PRESIDENT
                Can they see it?  Did it destroy
                the target?

     TANK COMMANDER'S POV THROUGH PERISCOPE - SAME

                Negative.  Target remains.

     INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME

     On the monitors as well, we can see the target remain.  The
     air is let out of the room, everyone deflated.

                                PRESIDENT
                Call them back.

                                NIMZIKI
                The other bombers might have more
                luck.  We shouldn't just give
                up...

                                PRESIDENT
                I said call them back.

     As the technicians call the bombers away, the President sinks
     into a depression.  His last hope of survival gone.

     Jasmine keeps Margaret company as the rest sleep around the
     last flames of their campfire.  From the worried expression on
     Jasmine's face we can tell that Margaret has gotten worse, her
     wounds bleeding badly.

     A WIND kicks up, the sound of an ENGINE approaching.  Jasmine
     squints her eyes looking up into the wind when a BRIGHT LIGHT
     engulfs her.

     JASMINE'S POV - LIGHTS - NIGHT

     Bright lights in the sky growing nearer.  Slowly the others
     begin to wake up, frightened as the lights INTENSIFY.

     The others slowly begin to retreat but Jasmine stands, staring
     defiantly.  A smile creeps across her face as she sees that
     the lights belong to...

     TRANSPORT HELICOPTER

     The Transport Helicopter touches down and Steve leaps out,

     The double doors burst open as the President carrying his

                How is she?

                I'm sorry, Mr. President.  If only
                we could have gotten to her
                sooner.

     The President puts his daughter down as he sees...

     PRESIDENT'S POV - MARGARET

     Margaret lays in bed, doctors and nurses surrounding her.
     Patricia rushes over.

                                ISAACS
                She's bleeding internally.
                There's nothing else we can do.

     Stunned, the President watches as Patricia hugs her mother.

                                MARGARET
                I'm right here, baby.

     Recovering, the President nods for the doctors to leave the
     room.  As they begin to march out, he makes his way over to
     his wife and daughter.

                                PRESIDENT
                Honey, why don't you wait outside
                so Mommy can get some rest.

     Patricia kisses her mother, says goodbye and leaves.  Out of
     sight, Margaret winces, fading away.  The President grabs her
     hand for support.  She squeezes tightly.

                                MARGARET
                     (through tears)
                I'm scared, Tom.

                                PRESIDENT
                It's okay.  The doctors said
                you're going to be just fine.

     Margaret smiles at the man she knows all too well.

                                MARGARET
                Liar.

     The look between them says more than any words.

     INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE MARGARET'S ROOM - LATER

     The President exits the room, overcome with emotion.
     Constance, the doctors and some medical crew move to comfort
     him.  He holds them off with a gesture.

     He looks up and sees Jasmine, Steve and Dylan down the hall.
     He pushes through the crowd and makes his way over to them.

                                JASMINE
                I'm so sorry.

                                PRESIDENT
                I just wanted to thank you.
                You're a very brave woman.

     Across the hall, Patricia sits in a chair, waiting.  Whitmore
     walks over to her and kneels down next to his small child.

                                PATRICIA
                Is Mommy sleeping now?

                                PRESIDENT
                Yes, baby.  Mommy's sleeping.

                                                        FADE OUT:

     A GARBAGE CAN

     Topples over with a BANG!  A foot steps in and starts kicking
     trash all over.

     EXT. AREA 51 - NIGHT

     David is drunkenly knocking everything over, making a gigantic
     mess.  Moishe comes up behind, restraining him.

                                MOISHE
                David, David!  What the hell are
                you doing!?

                                DAVID
                I'm making a mess.

                                MOISHE
                This I can see.

                                DAVID
                We've gotta burn the rain forest,
                Pops.  Dump toxic waste, pollute
                the air, rip up the ozone.  Maybe
                if we screw this planet up enough
                they won't want it anymore.

                                MOISHE
                David, you're drunk.

     David slips, falls on his ass, hard.  Moishe helps him back up
     on his feet.

                                MOISHE
                I think you better sleep this off.
                Go back inside before you catch a
                cold.

     Slowly David looks up towards Moishe, an idea.

                                DAVID
                Pops, you're a genius!

                                MOISHE
                What'd I say?

                                DAVID
                A cold?  Of course.

     Sobered, David jumps kisses his father and bolts inside.

                                                        CUT TO:

     INT. STORAGE LAB - DAY

     A large crowd has been gathered here at the lab.  General Grey
     and Nimziki walk up to Constance.

                                NIMZIKI
                All right, Connie, we're here.
                What's this all about?

                                CONSTANCE
                I really have no idea.  He just
                said to bring everyone down here.

     Steve shows Dylan the alien space craft.

                                DYLAN
                Does that thing fly in outer
                space?

     Steve loos up at the craft admiringly.

                                STEVE
                It certainly does.

     When the President enters a technician rushes over and knocks
     on the hatch door on the alien attacker.  The door swings open
     and David climbs down.

     Grabbing a coke can from the "recycle" trash bin, David places
     the empty can on top of the alien attacker.  David turns and
     faces the gathering.

                                DAVID
                Could anyone please step back
                away from the craft?

     They do and David nods to a Technician inside the craft.  The
     Technician disappears inside, closing the door behind him.  A
     loud HUM emits from the craft.  David has to yell over it.

                                DAVID
                Lt. Mitchell, would you mind
                drawing your pistol?

                                MITCHELL
                What?

                                DAVID
                From where you're standing, do you
                think you could shoot that can off
                the alien craft?

     Mitchell shrugs affirmatively.  David gestures for him to try.
     Taking aim, Mitchell SHOOTS.

     The bullet RICOCHETS off the attacker's protective shield.
     Several people in the crowd dock, afraid of being hit by the
     errant bullet.

                                DAVID
                Sorry 'bout that.  You see, it's
                protected by the craft's shields.
                We can't penetrate their defenses.

                                NIMZIKI
                We know that already.  What's your
                point?

     David walks over to his laptop, now connected directly to the
     craft by cables and starts typing furiously.

                                DAVID
                My point is if we can't beat their
                defenses, then we must get around
                them.

     David stops typing and stares at his wrist watch, silently
     counting down.

                                DAVID
                Lt. Mitchell, would you please try
                to shoot it again?

     Reluctantly Mitchell obliges.  This time the can is BLOWN OFF
     THE CRAFT.  Everyone in the room is shocked.  The Technician
     re-opens the craft's door and the loud HUM disappears.

                                GENERAL GREY
                How did you do that?

                                DAVID
                I gave it a cold.

     The President is fascinated, he steps closer.  Moishe beams
     proudly at his smart son.  Constance is amazed.

                                DAVID (cont'd)
                More accurately, I gave it a
                virus.  A computer virus.

     David turns his laptop around for the President to see.

                                GENERAL GREY
                Are you telling us you can send
                out a signal that will disable all
                their shields?

                                DAVID
                Just as they used our satellites
                against us, we can use their own
                signal against them.

     David walks over to a diagram he's made showing the
     relationship between the Mother Ship, the Space Crafts and the
     smaller alien attackers.

                                DAVID (cont'd)
                If we plant the virus directly
                into the mother ship, it would
                then filter down into all the
                corresponding ships below.

                                NIMZIKI
                And just how do we infect the
                "Mother Ship" with a virus?

     David gestures to the alien attacker behind him.

                                DAVID
                We'll have to fly their craft out
                of our atmosphere and dock with
                the mother ship.

     Intrigued Steve turns and looks back at the alien attacker,
     sizing it up.  David points to a satellite photo of the
     underbelly of the Mother Ship.

                                DAVID (cont'd)
                We can enter here, upload the
                virus and set off an explosion
                that could disable it.  This would
                disorient the smaller ship below
                and buy you some time to take them
                out.

     Constance reacts, realizing David's participation in the plan.

                                NIMZIKI
                This is ridiculous.

                                GENERAL GREY
                How long would their shields be
                down?

                                DAVID
                Once they discover the virus it
                could be a matter of minutes.

                                NIMZIKI
                You want us to co-ordinate a
                massive world wide counter strike
                with a window of only a few
                minutes?

                                GENERAL GREY
                With their shields down it might
                be possible.

                                NIMZIKI
                Please, you're not buying into any
                of this nonsense, are you?  We
                don't have the manpower or the
                resources to launch that kind of a
                campaign.
                     (gesturing to the alien
                         ship)
                Not to mention that this whole
                cockamamie plan is dependent on a
                machine that no one in the world
                is qualified to operate.

                                STEVE (O.S.)
                I wouldn't say that, sir.

     Everyone turns to Steve who steps through the crowd.

                                STEVE
                I've seen them in action.  I've
                watched their maneuvers.  With
                your permission, sir, I'd like the
                opportunity to try.

                                NIMZIKI
                That thing's a wreck.  It crash
                landed back in the fifties!  We
                don't even know if it's capable of
                flying.

     David turns to the Technicians.

                                DAVID
                Remove the clamps!

     Technicians move to the large holding clamps on either side of
     the craft.  With a loud CLANK, the clamps are pulled away.

     For a moment the hulking craft TEETERS unevenly, but quickly
     stabilizes, FLOATING ABOVE THEM.

                                DAVID
                Any other questions?

     Everyone stares at the floating ship with wonder.

                                PRESIDENT
                Let's do it.

     INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

     Constance, General Grey and the President are walking down the
     hall.  Nimziki rushes to catch up.

                                NIMZIKI
                I understand that you're upset
                over the death of your wife but
                that's no excuse for making
                another fatal mistake...

     The President whirls, grabs Nimziki and SLAMS him against the
     wall.  Holding him tight, the President gets in his face.

                                PRESIDENT
                The only mistake I made was
                appointing a sniveling little
                weasel like you Chief of Staff.

     Constance is about to intervene when General Grey stops her.

                                PRESIDENT (cont'd)
                But this is a mistake, I am
                thankful to say, I do not have to
                live with.  Mr. Nimziki, you're
                fired.

     The President releases him and turns to General Grey.

                                PRESIDENT (cont'd)
                Organize every plane you can find
                and get some Goddamned pilots
                to fly them.

                                GENERAL GREY
                Yes, Sir.

     He storms off leaving everyone stunned.

                                NIMZIKI
                He can't do that.

                                CONSTANCE
                     (amazed)
                He just did.

                                                        CUT TO:

     INT. MILITARY TENT - CONTINUOUS

     Four BRITISH AIR PILOTS are gathered around a table going over
     a map.  One pilot, REGINALD, is in charge.

                                REGINALD
                ...we've been told that there may
                be additional re-enforcement in
                hiding near the Golan Straights...

     Suddenly the flap to the tent opens.  All the pilots draw
     their pistols frightening the ARAB PILOT who stands in the
     doorway.  The Arab Pilot speaks quickly in Arabic.

                                REGINALD
                What the hell's he saying?

                                THOMSON
                     (explaining)
                Seems they're getting a signal.
                One Morse code.

     EXT. DRY LAKE - SECONDS LATER

     As they step out of the tent we SEE more than a HUNDRED
     FIGHTERS PLANES from different nations parked around them.
     They've all gone into hiding out here in the desert, divided
     into many smaller camps.

     Reginald and Thomson follow their Arab cohort, walking through
     the many other campsites.  Thomson gets some stares from the
     IRAQI PILOTS.

                                REGINALD
                I still get believe this.

                                THOMSON
                The Iraqis don't appear altogether
                too pleased with this arrangement.

                                REGINALD
                How do you think the Israelis
                feel?

     Sure enough a campsite of ISRAELI PILOTS sits very near by.

     ANGLE - ARABIAN AIR FORCE CAMP

     Dozens of Arab pilots are gathered around a large radio as the
     Morse code comes through.  Thomson quickly kneels down, taking
     notes.

                                THOMSON
                It's from the Americans.  They
                want to organize a counter
                offensive.

                                REGINALD
                It's about bloody time.  What do
                they plan to do?

     EXT. ICE PLATEAU - SIBERIA - DAY

     Several Russian Pilots are gathered around a radio, their
     dozen MIG FIGHTERS standing behind them.

                                RUSSIAN #1
                     (subtitled)
                They claims to be able to bring
                down their shields.

                                RUSSIAN #2
                When do they want to attack?

     EXT. VOLCANO BASE - FUJI - DAY

     At the base of a large Volcano in Fuji, several Japanese
     attack helicopters stand near their pilots, gathered around a
     radio.

                                JAPANESE PILOT
                     (subtitled)
                The attack begins in thirteen
                hours.

                                                        CUT TO:

     INT. AREA 51 - WAR ROOM - DAY

     A large world map has been constructed.  Several sites are
     marked with stickers reading: COMBAT READY.  Another sticker
     is put onto Mr. Fuji.

     Striding in, the President surveys the war room.  General Grey
     rushes over to meet him.

                                PRESIDENT
                How're we doing?

                                GENERAL GREY
                Better than we thought.

     General Grey leads the President over to the wall map.

                                GENERAL GREY
                We have confirmed divisions of
                troops from different armies all
                around the world.  Most of Europe,
                the Middle East and Asia are
                battle ready.

                                PRESIDENT
                And our troops here?

                                GENERALE GREY
                We've been collecting planes from
                all over but...

                                PRESIDENT
                But what, General?

                                GENERAL GREY
                Pilots, sir.  We don't have enough
                people to get them in the air.

                                PRESIDENT
                Then find them.

                                                        CUT TO:

     INT. BRENNON TRAILER - NIGHT

     Troy is sleeping peacefully in his bed.  Russell sits at the
     kitchen table as Miguel enters.

                                MIGUEL
                How' he doing?

                                RUSSELL
                Just fell asleep.  He's gonna be
                just fine.  Join me in a little
                celebration?

     Russell holds up his bottle of Jack Daniels.  Clearly he's
     been drinking again.  Miguel is crestfallen.  Pissed he turns
     and storms out.

                                RUSSELL
                Miguel.  Don't be mad.  Miguel!

     Drunkenly, Russell chases after him.

     INT. AREA 51 - REFUGEE CAMP - CONTINUOUS

     Making his way through the campers, Russell SEES a group of
     refugees around some MILITARY OFFICERS who addresses them.

                                OFFICER
                     (through megaphone)
                ...We're planning to launch a
                counter offensive...

     Russell wanders over towards them.

                                OFFICER (cont'd)
                ...with our depleted manpower we
                must ask that anyone with any
                flight experience come forward.
                Military training is preferable
                but anyone who can fly a plane
                could be useful...

     Russell pushes his way through the crowd.

                                RUSSELL
                     (slurred)
                I can fly, I mean, I'm a pilot.

     The officer just stares at the bottle of Jack Daniels still in
     his hand.

                                OFFICER
                Sorry, sir.

     Russell gets into his face, desperate.

                                RUSSELL
                You don't understand.  I've gotta
                be part of this.  This is
                important to me.  They ruined my
                life.

                                OFFICER
                Why don't you go somewhere and
                sleep it off.

     The Officers move on, taking a few volunteers with them.
     Russell watches them go, dejected.  Angrily, he throws the
     bottle of Jack, SMASHING it.

     INT. STORAGE LAB - NIGHT

     A large MISSILE slides back into a LAUNCHER that has been
     attached to the top of the alien attacker.  Some workers PAINT
     over the patch-work repairs.  Below, Mitchell briefs Steve and
     David.

                                MITCHELL
                We've hid the launcher in the
                ship's manifold.

     Mitchell takes a small black box from a table near by.

                                MITCHELL (cont'd)
                This will be attached to the ships
                main console.

                                STEVE
                It's just like an AMRAAM launch
                pad on the stealths.

                                MITCHELL
                Exactly.  Use it the same way.
                Only the nuke won't detonate on
                impact.  You'll have another
                thirty seconds to get as far away
                as you can.

                                DAVID
                I'll see how they're doing with
                the radio transmitter.

                                STEVE
                     (checking his watch)
                Oh shit, we're late.

                                DAVID
                We'll meet you there.

     Steve dashes off as David moves toward the attacker.
     Constance has been eavesdropping.  She walks to David.

                                CONSTANCE
                Thirty seconds?  Isn't that
                cutting it a little too close?

                                DAVID
                We'll be well on our way out of
                there before we shoot that thing
                off.

     David leans under the attacker where a TECHNICIAN is attaching
     another device.

                                TECHNICIAN
                It's the strongest SHF transmitter
                we could get.  It'll tell us when
                you've uploaded the virus.

                                DAVID
                Then cross your fingers the
                shields go down.

     David turns and walks away, Constance following.

                                CONSTANCE
                With you?  I don't understand why
                you can't just show someone how to
                plant the virus, somebody trained
                for this kind of mission?

                                DAVID
                If anything goes wrong I'll have
                to think quickly, adjust the
                signal, who knows?

     David stops, picking up a small trash can labelled "recycle."

                                DAVID
                     (smiling)
                You know how I'm always trying to
                save the planet.  This is my
                chance.

     David rushes off.  Constance watches him leave.

                                CONSTANCE
                     (to herself)
                Now he gets ambitious.

     INT. SMALL GATHERING HALL - SAME

     Jasmine is kneeling as Dylan tries to zip up the back of her
     dress.

                                DYLAN
                It's too tight.

                                JASMINE
                I had to borrow it.  I guess
                that's good enough.

     Jasmine stands, turns to Dylan.

                                JASMINE
                How do I look?

     She looks great.  But Dylan only gives her the "so-so" hand
     gesture.

                                JASMINE
                You're a lot of help.

     The door behind her flies open and Steve marches in.

                                JASMINE
                You're late.

                                STEVE
                You know me...

                                JASMINE
                I know, you like to make a big
                entrance.

     Steve moves next to Jasmine, takes her hand.

                                STEVE
                Before we do this, I want you to
                know I'm sorry.

                                JASMINE
                Sorry for what?

                                STEVE
                     (serious)
                I should have done this a long
                long time ago.

                                MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                Do you have the ring?

     As we REVERSE ANGLE we see that we are in a military CHAPEL, a
     large crucifix on the wall.  A CHAPLAIN stands by the altar.

                                STEVE
                You bet.

     Steve pulls out the famous "dolphin" ring.

                                CHAPLAIN
                Witnesses?

     Just then the doors open and David and Constance enter taking
     seats on opposing sides of the aisle.

                                CHAPLAIN
                Then let's get this show on the
                road.

     Steve and Jasmine take their places at the altar.  Jasmine is
     radiant.  Dylan rushes up and joins them.

     As the ceremony begins, David and Constance share a pregnant
     glance.  Slowly they reach across the aisle and hold hands as
     Steve and Jasmine exchange their vows.

                                                        CUT TO:

     HANGAR DOORS - PRE-DAWN

     Slowly spread apart revealing the myriad of different planes
     that have been gathered.  Pilots, flights crews and refugees
     prepare for the battle.

     EXT. AREA 51 - TARMAC - PRE-DAWN

     Walking out the President scans the motley collection of
     planes; old, new, high-tech, low-tech.

                                GENERAL GREY
                Beggars can't be choosers, sir.

     Nodding in agreement, the President walks among the rank and
     file.  Slowly they turn their attention to the President.

                                PRESIDENT
                Good morning.  In less than one
                hour planes from here and all
                around the world will launch the
                largest aerial battle in the
                history of mankind...
                     (beat)
                Mankind.  The word has new meaning
                for all of us now.  We are
                reminded not of our petty
                differences but of our common
                interests.

     Constance, David and Moishe join the group, listening.  Even
     David is moved.

                                PRESIDENT (cont'd)
                Perhaps it's fate that today, July
                the Fourth, we will once again
                fight for our freedom.  Not from
                tyranny, persecution or
                oppression.  But from
                annihilation.  We're fighting for
                our right to live, to exit.  From
                this day on, the fourth day of
                July will no longer be remembered
                as an American holiday but as the
                day that all of mankind declared
                we will not go quietly into the
                night.  We will not vanish without
                a fight.  We will live on.  We
                will survive.

     The crowd erupts into applause and cheers.  The President
     turns and walks over to an Officer holding a bundle of
     clothes.  General Grey confronts the President as he begins to
     disrobe.

                                GENERAL GREY
                Mr. President, just what do you
                think you're doing?

                                PRESIDENT
                I'm a pilot, Will.  This is where
                I belong.

     General Grey wants to argue but can't.

     INT. STORAGE LAB - SAME

     Constance and David embrace as Steve turns to Dylan.

                                STEVE
                When I'm back we'll light those
                fireworks.

     Jasmine hugs them both as Moishe walks over to David.

                                MOISHE
                David, take these.

     David looks down at the "barf bags" in Moishe's hand.

                                DAVID
                Thanks, Pops.

                                MOISHE
                I want you should know, I'm very
                proud of you, son.

     That means more to David than Moishe could have known.

                                CONSTANCE
                Be careful.

     Constance hugs David as Steve suddenly freaks out.

                                STEVE
                Damn it.  We can't go yet.  I
                gotta find some cigars.

     Steve is about to bolt when Moishe grabs him, retrieving two
     cigars from his coat pocket.

                                MOISHE
                My last two.  With my blessings.

                                STEVE
                You're a lifesaver.

     Steve grabs them and climbs inside.  David smiles awkwardly,
     then follows Steve.

     INT. ALIEN ATTACKER - CONTINUOUS

     The hatch shuts and David takes a seat next to Steve who hands
     him one of the cigars.

                                STEVE
                Hang on to this.  For our victory
                dance.  But not 'til we hear the
                fat lady sing.

     Reluctantly David takes it.  As he does Steve notices the
     "barf bag" on David's lap.  Off Steve's look...

                                DAVID
                I have a confession to make.  I'm
                not real big on flying.

                                STEVE
                Great.

     INT. STORAGE LAB - SAME

     Constance and Jasmine join the others behind the observation
     glass outside the room as the Attacker prepares for lift off.

     Part of the ceiling suddenly PEELS AWAY, revealing an enormous
     SHAFT leading topside.

     INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME

     Strapping in and securing their equipment, Steve grabs hold of
     the throttle.

                                STEVE
                You ready?  Let' rock and roll.

     Steve pulls back on the throttle but the attacker swings
     BACKWARDS.

     INT. STORAGE LAB - SAME

     The Alien Attacker SMASHES BACKWARD into the rear of the lab.
     Moishe winces as the others react fearfully.

     INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME

     Embarrassed, Steve adjusts the throttle.

                                STEVE
                Oops.

     Like a stick shift diagram of a car, a small hand written
     "post it" card is pasted onto the dash.  Steve reaches over
     and turns it upside down, righting the problem.

                                STEVE
                Let's try that again.

     This time he pushes the throttle forward and the Attacker
     JERKS ahead.

     INT. STORAGE LAB - CONTINUOUS

     Shooting up into the ceiling shaft above, the Attacker ZOOMS
     out of the underground laboratory.

     EXT. AREA 51 - SHAFT - SAME

     With a WHOOSH the Alien Attacker ZOOMS out of the underground
     shaft and SOARS into the sky.  Once high enough it goes into a
     wild barrel roll.

     INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME

     Just as it comes out of the roll.

                                DAVID
                What the hell are you doing?

                                STEVE
                Just getting a feel for her.

     EXT. MORNING SKIES - CLOUD BANK - SAME

     The Attacker arcs upward and disappears into the clouds.

     The President watches the Attacker flying away.  His canopy
     locks down as he adjusts his helmet.

                I think our secret is out.
                They're headed right for us.

     INT. PRESIDENT'S PLANE - SAME

                                GENERAL GREY
                     (filtered)
                ETA thirty six minutes.

     The President gets a determined look in his eye.  He FIRES UP
     his engine.  Following his lead, engines ignite, canopies lock
     down and planes taxi to position.

     EXT. UPPER ATMOSPHERE - ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME

     The captured alien attacker soars higher and higher.

     INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

     Slowly getting sick, David holds onto his "barf bag."

                                STEVE
                You still with me?

     David nods sheepishly.  Steve's eyes go wide with wonder as
     the ship climbs to the edge of our atmosphere.

                                STEVE
                     (to himself)
                I've waited a long time for this.

     The ship begins to SHAKE, rattling harshly as it climbs.
     Through the window we SEE the blue sky EVAPORATE.  Slowly a
     field of STARS take its place.

     This is the moment Steve had wished for all his life.  He's
     not disappointed.  David, however, is not so thrilled.

     EXT. SPACE - STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

     Heading further into space, ZOOMING overhead.

     INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

     Through the windshield we see a huge OBJECT floating in
     the distance, the moon behind it.

                                DAVID
                That's it.  Head straight for it.

     But Steve gets distracted, something wrong with the controls.

                                STEVE
                Something's happening.  It's not
                responding.

     David looks over at his laptop, connected to the ship's on
     board computers.  Th signal is ADJUSTING.

                                DAVID
                     (thrilled)
                I was counting on that.  They're
                bringing us in.

     EXT. BLUE SKIES - MORNING

     The President's plane leads thirty fighters in attack
     formation.

                                PRESIDENT
                We have visual.

     RESERVE ANGLE - ALIEN SPACE CRAFT

     The fifteen mile wide space craft peeks over a mountain range
     headed straight for us.

                                GENERAL GREY
                     (filtered)
                Do not engage until we've
                confirmed the package has been
                delivered.

                                PRESIDENT
                Roger.

     INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

     Constance is standing by Lt. Mitchell behind the Military
     cadre coordinating the battle.

                                CONSTANCE
                What if that thing gets here
                before we can plant the virus?

                                MITCHELL
                The entire compound is buried deep
                within the mountain.  It should
                give us some protection.

                                CONSTANCE
                But what about all the people
                outside?

     Mitchell shoots her a worried look.  Quickly they both dash
     outside.

     EXT. MOTHER SHIP - SAME

     Steve and David's attacker flies towards the gigantic Mother
     Ship.  Hundreds of other attackers flow in and out of the
     Mother Ship through the many triangular portals.  Steve and
     David's attacker's drawn into one of them.

     INT. PORTAL SHAFT - MOTHER SHIP - SAME

     Caught in a stream of attackers, they flow through the portal
     shaft leading into this planet sized space craft.  They pass
     by enormous windows revealing the HUNDREDS OF ALIENS working
     within the Mother Ship.

     We spill out of the shaft and into a gigantic cavity
     stretching out beyond visibility.  Enormous TOWERS are
     scattered throughout.

     INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - CONTINUOUS

     Neither can believe their eyes.  Staring out the front window
     they SEES...

     STEVE AND DAVID'S POV ALIEN TROOP PARADE GROUND

     Below them THOUSANDS OF ALIENS can be seen as they are marched
     into dozens of enormous TROOP CONTAINERS docked at the edges
     of the parade grounds.

                                DAVID
                Must be thousands of them.  What
                are they doing?

                                STEVE
                Looks like they're preparing the
                invasion.

     INT. DOCKING STATIONS - MOTHER SHIP - CONTINUOUS

     They pass the parade ground and head into the middle of this
     huge cavernous sphere, closing in on the many LANDINGS.
     Hundreds of attackers are docked at each one.

     In the center of the Landing are large BAY WINDOWS, inside is
     a kind of control tower.  We can SEE several ALIEN WORKERS
     through the glass.  Steve and David's attacker is heading
     straight towards them.

                                STEVE
                This won't work.  They'll see
                before we can do anything.

     Lifting up another hand written card labeled "window," David
     pushes the button underneath.

                                DAVID
                These things are fully equipped.
                Reclining bucket seats, power
                windows...

     A BLAST SHIELD lowers covering the window.

     Slowly Steve and David's attacker lowers onto large docking
     CLAMPS which LOCK ON, holding it in place.

                                DAVID
                We're in!

     David starts typing frantically.

     INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

     Mitchell turns from one of the consoles to General Grey.

                                MITCHELL
                He's uploading the virus.

                                GENERAL GREY

                Eagle One...

     EXT. BLUE SKIES - SAME

     The Presidential attack squadron zeroing in on target.

                     (filtered)
                ...the package is being delivered.

     EXT. AREA 51 - BRENNON TRAILER - SAME

     Alicia struggles to drag out a large duffle bag.  Philip (the
     boy who brought the penicillin earlier) rushes over.

                                PHILIP
                Let me get that.

     He grabs the bag for her.  Alicia smiles.  Miguel helps Troy
     down from the trailer.  As they rush away, Miguel turns to
     Philip.

                                MIGUEL
                Where's Russell?

     ANGLE - HANGAR - ENTRANCE TO COMPOUND

     Constance, Jasmine and Mitchell are helping to usher the
     refugees into the compound.

                                CONSTANCE
                Hurry, we've got to get everyone
                inside.

     Constance looks up and SEES off in the distance...

     THE ALIEN SPACE CRAFT

     Piercing the horizon, coming over the top of a distant
     mountain.  Headed this way.

     INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

     David finishes typing.  The screen on his laptop flashes:
     UPLOAD COMPLETE.

                                DAVID
                The virus is in.  All we can do
                now is pray.

     EXT. BLUE SKIES - AMERICAN FIGHTERS - SAME

                Delivery complete.  Engage.

                                PRESIDENT
                Roger.

     The fighter jets GUN IT and overtake the smaller planes in
     front of them.

     Below the President's plane the weapons bay door opens and a
     long range AMRAAM Missile DROPS DOWN, computes its target and
     DARTS OFF.

     INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

     Mitchell and General Grey move over to a monitor showing
     visual from the Present's Plane.  They SEE the missile
     moving towards target.

                                GENERAL GREY
                Keep your fingers crossed.

     EXT. AMERICAN FIGHTERS - SAME

     The pilots watch nervously as the missile nears its target.

                                PRESIDENT
                Come on, baby.

     ANGLE - AMRAAM MISSILE

     Just as it gets to the shield perimeter, the missile EXPLODES.
     The shields are still up.

     INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

     They watch the missile blow up harmlessly.  Deflated, General
     Grey grabs his mic.

                                GENERAL GREY
                It didn't work.  Disengage.  Sir,
                get your people out of there.

     EXT. PRESIDENT'S PLANE - SAME

     The President is not ready to give up.

                                PRESIDENT
                Not yet!

     Below his plane another MISSILE drops down, and DARTS OFF.

     ANGLE - MISSILE

     This one goes past the point of the previous explosion.  It
     moves in closer and closer.  Suddenly it HITS THE SIDE OF THE
     SHIP.  A HUGE EXPLOSION, rips off a part of the side of this
     immense ship.

     INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

     We SEE the explosion on the monitor.  Everyone in the room
     CHEERS.

                                GENERAL GREY
                You did it!  A direct hit!

     EXT. BLUE SKIES - AMERICAN FIGHTERS - SAME

     The pilots are thrilled.

                                PRESIDENT
                We're going in!  Squadron leaders,
                take point.

     The fighters break off into six group of five.  One by one,
     each fighter DROPS A MISSILE.  We follow DOZENS OF MISSILES on
     their way to the space craft.

     ANGLE - SPACE CRAFT

     The Attacker Bay doors open and DOZENS OF ALIEN ATTACKERS
     shoot out.  Spreading wide.

     Guided missiles EXPLODES as they hit the City Destroyer,
     damaging the outer hull.  The Attackers go after the American
     fighters.  The six groups split wide.  An aerial dog fight
     ensues.

     EXT. AREA 51 - REFUGEE CAMP - SAME

     Miguel searches for Russell as the refugees run for the
     hangar.

                                MIGUEL
                Russell!

     Miguel gets swept up in the tide.  As the last of them enter
     the hangar, TWO ALIEN ATTACKERS arrive behind them, STRAFING
     the ground.  The rows of trailers homes EXPLODE one after
     another.

     ANGLE - ELEVATOR HALLWAY - BACK OF HANGAR

     Constance ushers the crowd into the elevator hallway.  Packed
     into the hallway together, they are panicked at the sound of
     the nearby explosions.  As the last one is safely inside,
     Constance turns back and SEES...

     CONSTANCE'S POV - HANGAR AND ATTACKERS

     The attackers FIRE and the front half of the hangar EXPLODES.
     Constance is KNOCKED back against the wall.  She activates the
     elevator and the room begins to SINK.

     As the hallway submerges, the entire hangar comes CRASHING
     DOWN behind them.

     INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

     Over monitors the General observes the aerial battle.  This
     room, too, ROCKS from the explosions.  The monitors FLICKER.

     INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

     Steve struggles with the controls but is getting no where.

                                DAVID
                Get us out of here!

                                STEVE
                I can't shake her free.

     EXT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

     Though the attacker guns its engine, the CLAMPS below HOLD
     TIGHT.

     INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

     David moves over to the computer to see if he can help.
     Suddenly the large window slowly begins to DROP DOWN.

                                STEVE
                What're you doing?

                                DAVID
                It's not me.  They're overriding
                the system.

     The blast shield continues to peel away.  David and Steve drop
     down below the dash, hiding from view.  As the view becomes
     unobstructed we SEE...

     POV - THROUGH WINDOW - THE LANDING

     Several Alien's looking across at us from the large bay
     window of the Landing's control tower.

                                STEVE
                Damn!

     David leans from his hiding position and SEES several other
     alien attackers are moving in on them.  They are surrounded.

                                DAVID
                Check and mate.

     INT. AREA 51 - RESEARCH FACILITY - SAME

     Like images from England during the blitzkrieg, the refugees
     are huddled on the floor, the lights FLICKERING and the muted
     sounds of distant EXPLOSIONS.  Miguel moves through the
     refugees, searching for Russell.

     A Yarmulke is unfolded.  As it is lifted we realize Moishe is
     putting it on.  He holds the hands with the people around him
     and begins to pray.  Nimziki moves next to Moishe.  Moishe
     takes his hand.

                                NIMZIKI
                I'm not Jewish.

                                MOISHE
                It's okay.

     ANGLE - PHILIP AND ALICIA

     As another bomb rocks the room, Alicia moves closer to Philip.

                                ALICIA
                This could be our last night on
                Earth.  I don't want to die a
                virgin.

                                PHILIP
                If we do, we'll both die virgins.
                But at last we'll be together.

     Alicia smiles, a nice guy at last.

     EXT. AREA 51 - SPACE SHIP - SAME

     The City Destroyer space ship is settling just above the
     compound as the American fighters circle it, chased by the
     attackers.  Below the SCHISM begins to open!

     INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

     In all the commotion, no one notices as Miguel sneaks inside.

                                OFFICER
                We're running out of missiles,
                Sir.  We're just not causing
                enough damage.

     EXT. PRESIDENT'S PLANE - SAME

                                GENERAL GREY
                     (filtered)
                They're getting ready to fire the
                big gun.  You're going to have to
                find a vulnerable spot, fast.

                                PRESIDENT
                I've got an idea.  Keep 'em off my
                tail.

     Taking the advice, the President DIVES.  He's met by two
     flanking Fighters (EAGLES 9 & 2) as they cruise the underbelly
     of the City Destroyer.  Sure enough, the SCHISM is opening,
     preparing to fire the WALL OF DESTRUCTION.

                                PRESIDENT
                Let's take 'em out before they
                take us out.

     The President locks the SCHISM hatchway into the center of his
     HUD (heads up display).  Just as he FIRES, Eagle 9 is BLOWN
     OUT OF THE SKY.  It rocks the President, sending his missile
     off target.

     Off balance, the missile hits just wide of the hatchway and
     EXPLODES, rocking the entire ship.

                                PRESIDENT
                I'm out of missiles!  Eagle 2?

                                EAGLE #2 PILOT
                I'm on it.

     But before he can target, his fighter EXPLODES.

     INT. HALLWAY - SAME

     The lights continue to flicker.  Jasmine grabs onto Dylan and
     Patricia, holding them tight.

     INT. WAR ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     On the monitor we SEE the SCHISM, and BRIGHT LIGHTS as several
     fighters fly past.

                                GENERAL GREY
                We're out of time.  Get out of
                there!  Get as far away as you
                can.

     EXT. PRESIDENT'S FIGHTER - SAME

     Pissed, the President refuses to give up.

                                PRESIDENT
                Doesn't anyone have any damned
                missiles left?!

                                RUSSELL (O.S.)
                Sorry I'm late, Mr. President.

     The President spins and SEES darting out of the clouds...

     RUSSELL'S OLD BI-PLANE

     Russell ZOOMS past the President and alien attackers, barely
     missing their FIRE.

                It's okay, Sir.  I'm packin'.

     We SEE he has a large MISSILES propped up in the seat behind
     him.  A light on it flashes ARMED.

                Just keep those guys off me for a
                few more seconds.

     Hearing his voice, Miguel is shocked.  He moves closer towards
     the monitors.

     EXT. CITY DESTROYER - SAME

     The remaining fighters lay down COVER FIRE for Russell's old
     bi-wing.  Russell heads directly TOWARDS THE SCHISM.

     INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

     Everyone is gripped to the screen as we see it get closer and
     closer to the closing bay doors.  Miguel is aghast.

                ...tell my children I love them
                very much.

     EXT. CITY DESTROYER - SCHISM - SAME

     Russell nears the SCHISM, a hail of alien firepower erupting
     around him.

                                MIGUEL
                     (filtered)
                Dad!  No!

     Russell smiles at b being called "Dad."

                                RUSSELL
                I've got to, kid.  You were always
                better at taking care of them than
                I was anyways.

     Russell turns off his radio as he banks UPWARD towards the
     open SCHISM.  The climb is steep, and the bi-wing nearly
     stalls out.

     Suddenly the bright lights VANISH and the beam begins to form.

     Russell's bi-wing just makes it INSIDE THE OPEN SCHISM and
     disappears from view.

     The President and remaining fighters BANK AWAY, clearing.

     Suddenly, A GIGANTIC EXPLOSION, RIPS THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE
     SPACE CRAFT.  It's causing a CHAIN REACTION of explosion.

     Teetering, the entire space ship, turns away out of control.

     INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

     The room erupts in CHEERS.  Everyone, that is, except Miguel.

     EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - SAME

     Not far away from Area 51, the enormous craft is burning from
     the center outwards.  Suddenly it DROPS and COLLIDES with the
     mountain range, EXPLODING ON IMPACT.

     INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

     Intercepting the celebration, General Grey moves over to a
     radio technician.

                                GENERAL GREY
                Let's get on the wire.  Tell every
                squadron around the world how to
                shoot those fuckers down.

     INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME

     Sitting below the dash, Steve takes out the cigars, hands one
     to David.

                                STEVE
                I guess there's nothing left to
                do.  Let's nuke 'em.

     David realizes they're both about to die.  He stares at the
     cigar.

                                DAVID
                     (re: cigar)
                Funny, I always thought things
                like these would kill me.

     They share a quick sober laugh.

                                STEVE
                Nice meeting you.

                                DAVID
                You as well.

     Steve lights his cigar, then lights David's.

                                STEVE
                Ready?

     EXT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME

     Popping up from behind the dash, cigars in their mouths, Steve
     and David start waving "good-bye" like idiots.

     The Aliens in the tower don't know how to react.  The
     attackers move in for the kill.

     INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

                                STEVE
                Think they know what's coming?

     He reaches down to the black box we saw before and enters the
     launch code.

                                DAVID
                     (still waving)
                Not a chance in hell.

     EXT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

     Suddenly the missile ERUPTS from behind the manifold and
     BLASTS into the control tower, SHATTERING THE GLASS WINDOW.

     INT. CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     The missile SMASHES through the glass.  The atmosphere
     impeached, the aliens quickly succumb to the elements, chocking
     and dying.

     The missile BLASTS by WRECKING equipment until it LODGES into
     the back wall of the Landing tower.

     A small counter on the missile begins to count down 30:00,
     29:00, 28:00...

     EXT. DOCKING CLAMPS - SAME

     Rocked from the explosions, the docking clamps RELEASES and the

     Steve grabs the controls.

                                STEVE
                We're loose!

                                DAVID
                Doesn't matter.  Game's over.

                                STEVE
                I don't hear no fat lady.

     Steve THROTTLES IT.  The craft JOLTS AWAY.

     EXT. DOCKING STATION - SAME

     Steve and David's attacker BLAST away, the other alien
     attackers follow in hot pursuit.

     The attackers FIRE.  Steve SWERVES avoiding the blasts as they
     race for the exit.

     INT. LANDING - CONTROL TOWER - SAME

     Grasping for breath, a dying Alien looks up at the wedged in
     nuclear missile.  The counter reads: 00:04, 00:03, 00:02.

     We get the feeling the Alien knows what's coming.

     INT. DOCKING BAY - SAME

     Steve and David's attacker just reaches the doorway as the
     center of the landing EXPLODES behind them.

     The enormous impact, rocks some of the lagging attackers off
     track.

     EXT. MOTHER SHIP - SAME

     Steve DARTS his attacker out from underneath the Mother Ship's
     belly.  A group of attackers FOLLOW.

     Just as the last of them exit the docking bay, a HUGE FIREBALL
     erupts behind them ripping through the Mother Ship.

     ANGLE - FARTHER AWAY

     ZOOMING towards us, Steve guides his ship away.  The Alien
     attackers in hot pursuit.  Behind them we SEE the ENTIRE
     MOTHER SHIP EXPLODE.

     The immense EXPLOSION GROWS OUTWARDS coming right at us.  The
     ATTACKERS are GOBBLED UP as the EXPLOSION WIDENS.  Quickly the
     explosion gains ground on Steve and David.

     ANGLE - STEVE AND DAVID'S SHIP

     Like a loose board caught in the surf, Steve and David's ship
     rides the edge of the explosion, getting knocked END OVER END.

     INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER

     Tumbling ass over tea kettle, David and Steve are ROCKED in
     their seats.  Steve battles to regain control of the ship.

     EXT. STEVE AND DAVID'S SHIP

     The mammoth fireball reaches the outer edge of its zenith.
     Steve and David's ship is SPIT OUT, tumbling down towards
     EARTH.

     EXT. AREA 51 - TARMAC - SAME

     The fighters are returning home.  Crowd RACE out of the ruins

     arrival.

     THE PRESIDENT'S PLANE

     The President is climbing out as General Grey rushes to his
     aid.  Behind him, Jasmine leads Dylan and Patricia, who breaks
     free and RUSHES to her father.  The President sweeps her up in
     his arms as Jasmine approaches.

                                JASMINE
                     (to General Grey)
                Any word from Steve?

     Behind her, Constance rushes over, the same thing on her mind.
     Before he can answer they HEAR a ROAR above.  They all become
     silent as they turn and look to the skies.

     ANGLE - BLUE SKIES - FIREBALL

     The FIREBALL COMET is rapidly shooting down towards us.
     Suddenly BURSTING OUT OF THE FLAMES, Steve and David's ship
     DARTS DOWN.

     Just over the heads of the cheering crowds, Steve and David's
     ship ZOOMS overhead, disappearing out of sight.

     EXT. DRY LAKE - DESERT - MINUTES LATER

     Several army JEEPS race across the arid desert floor.  As they
     WHIP past we see they are headed towards a gigantic BLACK
     PLUME OF SMOKE in the distance.

     ANGLE PLUME OF SMOKE

     The Jeeps SKID to a halt.  Jasmine and Constance are the first
     to leap off the Jeeps.

     Steve and David walk towards us, cigars in their mouths.
     Jasmine races over to him.

                                JASMINE
                You scared the hell out of me.

                                STEVE
                Yeah, but what an entrance!

                                JASMINE
                Dick-weed.

                                STEVE
                Butt-munch.

     Constance comes running up to David, hugs him tightly.

                                CONSTANCE
                Are you all right?

                                DAVID
                Did it work?

                                CONSTANCE
                You bet it did.

     She hugs him.  They kiss.

     ANGLE - STEVE AND JASMINE

     Behind them Dylan, Patricia, the President and General Grey
     come walking over.  The President and General Grey approach.

                                PRESIDENT
                We're getting reports from all
                over.  Their ships are going down!

     As they begin to celebrate, they look up to the sky.

     GROUP POV - BRILLIANT LIGHTS IN THE SKIES

     The debris from the Mother Ship explosion enters the
     atmosphere like thousands of SHOOTING STARS.  It's an
     incredible sight.

     The group stares happily at the show in the sky.  Steve takes
     Dylan by the hand.

                                STEVE
                Didn't I promise you fireworks?

     Everyone stares in wonder at the beautiful lights.
