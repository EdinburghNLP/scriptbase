All About Eve

FADE IN:

INT. DINING HALL - SARAH SIDDONS SOCIETY - NIGHT

It is not a large room and jammed with tables, mostly for
four but some for six and eight. A long table of honor, for
about thirty people, has been placed upon a dais. 

Diner is over. Demi-tasses, cigars and brandy. The overall
effect is one of worn elegance and dogged gentility. It is
June.

The CAMERA, as it has been throughout the CREDIT TITLES, is
on the SARAH SIDDONS AWARD. It is a gold statuette, about a
foot high, of Sarah Siddons as The Tragic Muse. Exquisitely
framed in a nest of flowers, it rests on a miniature altar in
the center of the table of honor. 

Over this we hear the crisp, cultured, precise VOICE of
ADDISON deWITT:

               ADDISON'S VOICE
      The Sarah Siddons Award for
      Distinguished Achievement is
      perhaps unknown to you. It has been
      spared the sensational and
      commercial publicity that attends
      such questionable "honors" as the
      Pulitzer Prize and those awards
      presented annually by the film
      society...

The CAMERA has EASED BACK to include some of the table of
honor and a distinguished gentleman with snow-white hair who
is speaking. We do not hear what he says. 

               ADDISON'S VOICE
      The distinguished looking gentleman
      is an extremely old actor. Being an
      actor - he will go on speaking for
      some time. It is not important what
      you hear what he says. 

The CAMERA EASES BACK some more, and CONTINUES until it
discloses a fairly COMPREHENSIVE SHOT of the room

               ADDISON'S VOICE
      However it is important that you
      know where you are, and why you are
      here. This is the dining room of
      the Sarah Siddons Society.
      The occasion is its annual banquet
      and presentation of the highest
      honor our Theater knows - the Sarah
      Siddons Award for Distinguished
      Achievement. 

A GROUP OF WAITERS are clustered near the screen masking the
entrances of the kitchen. The screens are papered with old
theatrical programs. The waiters are all aged and venerable.
They look respectfully toward the speaker. 

               ADDISON'S VOICE
      These hollowed walls, indeed many
      of these faces, have looked upon
      Modjeska, Ada Rehan and Minnie
      Fiske; Mansfield's voice filled the
      room, Booth breathed this air. It
      is unlikely that the windows have
      been opened since his death. 

CLOSE - THE AWARD on its altar, it shines proudly above five
or six smaller altars which surround it and which are now
empty. 

               ADDISON'S VOICE
      The minor awards, as you can see,
      have already been presented. Minor
      awards are for such as the writer
      and director - since their function
      is merely to construct a tower so
      that the world can applaud a light
      which flashes on top of it and no
      brighter light has ever dazzled the
      eye than Eve Harrington. Eve... but
      more of Eve, later. All about Eve,
      in fact.  

THE CAMERA MOVES TO: CLOSE - ADDISON deWITT, not young, not
unattractive, a fastidious dresser, sharp of eye and
merciless of tongue. An omnipresent cigarette holder projects
from his mouth like the sward of D'Artagnan. 

He sits back in his chair, musingly, his fingers making
little cannonballs out of bread crumbs. His narration covers
the MOVE of the CAMERA to him:

               ADDISON'S VOICE
      To those of you who do not read,
      attend the Theater, listen to
      uncensored radio programs or know
      anything of the world in which we
      live - it is perhaps necessary to
      introduce myself. My name is
      Addison deWitt.
      My native habitat is the Theater -
      in it I toil not, neither do I
      spin. I am a critic and
      commentator. I am essential to the
      Theater - as ants are to a picnic,
      as the ball weevil to a cotton
      field... 

He looks to his left. KAREN RICHARDS is lovely and thirtyish
in an unprofessional way. She is scraping bread crumbs,
spilled sugar, etc., into a pile with a spoon. Addison takes
one of her bread crumbs. She smiles absently. Addison rolls
the bread crumb into a cannonball. 

               ADDISON'S VOICE
      This is Karen Richards. She is the
      wife of a playwright, therefore of
      the Theater by marriage. Nothing in
      her background or breeding should
      have brought her any closer the
      stage than row E, center...

Karen continues her doodling. 

               ADDISON'S VOICE
      ... however, during her senior year
      in Radcliffe, Lloyd Richards
      lectured on drama. The following
      year Karen became Mrs. Lloyd
      Richards. Lloyd is the author of
      'Footsteps on the Ceiling' - the
      play which has won for Eve
      Harrington the Sarah Siddons
      Award...

Karen absently pats the top of her little pile of refuse. A
hand reaches in to take the spoon away. Karen looks as the
CAMERA PANS with IT to MAX FABIAN. He sits at her left. He's
a sad-faced man with glasses and a look of constant
apprehension. He smiles apologetically and indicated a white
powder with he unwraps. He pantomimes that his ulcer is
snapping.   

Karen smiles back, returns to her doodling. Addison mashes a
cigarette stub, pops it out of his holder. He eyes Max. 

               ADDISON'S VOICE
      There are two types of theatrical
      producers. One has a great many
      wealthy friends who will risk a tax
      deductible loss. This type is
      interested in Art. 

Max drops the powder into some water, stirs it, drinks, burps
delicately and close his eyes. 

               ADDISON'S VOICE
      The other is one to whom each
      production mean potential ruin or
      fortune. This type is out to make a
      buck. Meet Max Fabian. He is the
      producer of the play which has won
      Eve Harrington the Sarah Siddons
      Award...

Max rests fitfully. He twitches. A hand reaches into the
SCENE, removes a bottle of Scotch from before him. The CAMERA
follows the bottle to MARGO CHANNING. She sits at Max's left,
at deWitt's right. An attractive, strong face. She is
childish, adult, reasonable, unreasonable - usually one when
she should be the other, but always positive. She pours a
stiff drink.   

Addison hold out the soda bottle to her. She looks at it, and
at him, as if it were a tarantula and he had gone mad. He
smiles and pours a glass of soda for himself. 

               ADDISON'S VOICE
      Margo Channing is the Star of the
      Theater. She made her first stage
      appearance, at the age of four, in
      'Midsummer Night's Dream'. She
      played a fairy and entered - quite
      unexpectedly - stark naked. She has
      been a Star ever since. 

Margo sloshes her drink around moodily, pulls at it.

               ADDISON'S VOICE
      Margo is a great Star. A true Star.
      She never was or will be anything
      less or anything less... 
          (slight pause)
      ... the part for which Eve
      Harrington is receiving the Sarah
      Siddons Award was intended
      originally for Margo Channing...

Addison, having sipped his soda water, puts a new cigarette
in his holder, leans back, lights it, looks and exhales in
the general direction of the table of honor. As he speaks the
CAMERA MOVES in the direction of his glance...

               ADDISON'S VOICE
      Having covered in tedious detail
      not only the history of the Sarah
      Siddons Society, but also the
      history of acting since Thespis
      first stepped out of the chorus
      line - our distinguished chairman
      has finally arrived at our reason
      for being here...  

At this point Addison's voice FADES OUT and the voice of the
aged actor FADES IN. CAMERA is in MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT of him
and the podium. 

               AGED ACTOR
      I have been proud and privileged to
      have spent my life in the Theater -
      "a poor player ... that struts and
      frets his hour upon the stage" -
      and I have been honored to be, for
      forty years, Chief Promoter of the
      Sarah Siddons Society...
          (he lifts the Sarah
           Siddons Award from its
           altar)
      Thirty-nine times have I placed in
      deserving hands this highest honor
      the Theater knows...
          (he grows a bit arch, he
           uses his eyebrows)
      Surely no actor is older than I - I
      have earned my place out of the
      sun...
          (indulgent laughter)
      ... and never before has this Award
      gone to anyone younger than its
      recipient tonight. How fitting that
      it should pass from my hands to
      hers...

EVE HANDS: Lovely, beautifully groomed. In serene repose,
they rest between a demi-tasse cup and an exquisite small
evening cup.  

               AGED ACTOR
      Such young hands. Such a young
      lady. Young in years, but whose
      heart is as old as the Theater...

Addison's eyes narrow quizzically as he listens. Then,
slowly, he turns to look at Karen...

               AGED ACTOR
      Some of us a privileged to know
      her. We have seen beyond the beauty
      and artistry- 

Karen never ceases her thoughtful pat-a-cake with the crumbs. 

               AGED ACTOR
      -that have made her name resound
      through the nation. We know her
      humility. Her devotion, her loyalty
      to her art. 

Addison's glance moves from Karen to Margo. 

               AGED ACTOR
      Her love, her deep and abiding love
      for us-

Margo's face is a mask. She looks down at the drink which she
cradles with both hands. 

               AGED ACTOR
      -for what we are and what we do.
      The Theater. She has had one wish,
      one prayer, one dream. To belong to
      us. 
          (he's nearing his curtain
           line)
      Tonight her dream has come true.
      And henceforth we shall dream the
      same of her. 
          (a slight pause)
      Honored members, ladies and
      gentlemen - for distinguished
      achievement in the Theater - the
      Sarah Siddons Award to Miss Eve
      Harrington. 

The entire room is galvanized into sudden and tumultuous
applause. Some enthusiastic gentlemen rise to her feet...
Flash bulbs start popping about halfway down the table of the
Aged Actor's left... 

Eve rises - beautiful, radiant, poised, exquisitely gowned.
She stands in simple and dignified response to the ovation. 

A dozen photographers skip, squat, and dart about like water
bugs. Flash bulbs pop and pop and pop...

THE WAITERS applaud enthusiastically...

AGED ACTOR, Award in hand, he beams at her...

EVE smiles sweetly to her left, then to her right...

MAX has come to. He applauds lustily.

ADDISON's applauding too, more discreetly. 

MARGO, not applauding. But you sense no deliberate slight,
merely an impression that as she looks at Eve her mind is on
something else...

KAREN, nor is she applauding. But her gaze is similarly fixed
on Eve in a strange, faraway fashion. 

ADDISON, still applauding, his eyes flash first at Margo and
then at Karen. Then he directs them back to Eve. He smiles
ever so slightly.  

The applause has continued unabated. EVE turns now, and moves
gracefully toward the Aged Actor. She moves through
applauding ladies and gentlemen; from below the flash bulbs
keep popping... 

As she nears her goal, the Ages Actor turns to her. He holds
out the award. Her hand reaches out for it. At that precise
moment - with the award just beyond her fingertips - THE
PICTURE HOLDS, THE ACTION STOPS. The SOUND STOPS. 

               ADDISON'S VOICE
      Eve. Eve, the Golden Girl. The
      cover girl, the girl next door, the
      girl on the moon... Time has been
      good to Eve, Life goes where she
      goes - she's been profiled,
      covered, revealed, reported, what
      she eats and when and where, whom
      she knows and where she was and
      when and where she's going...   

ADDISON has stopped applauding, he's sitting forward, staring
intently at Eve... his narration continues unbroken.

               ADDISON'S VOICE
      ... Eve. You all know all about
      Eve... what can there be to know
      that you don't know...?

As he leans back, the APPLAUSE FADES IN as tumultuous as
before. Addison's look moves slowly from Eve to Karen.  

KAREN, she leans forward now, her eyes intently on Eve. Her
lovely face FILLS THE SCREEN as the APPLAUSE FADES ONCE MORE -
as she thinks back:

               KAREN'S VOICE
      When was it? How long? It seems a
      lifetime ago. Lloyd always said
      that in the Theater a lifetime was
      a season, and a season a lifetime.
      It's June now. That was - early
      October... only last October. It
      was a drizzly night, I remember I
      asked the taxi to wait...

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. NEW YORK THEATER STREET - NIGHT

Traffic is not heavy, the shows have broken some half-hour
before. The rain is just a drizzle. 

There are other theaters on the street; display lights are
being extinguished. Going out just as Karen's taxi pulls up
is: MARGO CHANNING in 'AGED IN WOOD'. The marquis display
below includes "Max Fabian Presents" and "By Lloyd Richards."

The taxi comes to a stop at the alley. Karen can be seen
through the closed windows telling the driver to wait. Then
she gets out. She takes a step, hesitates, then looks about
curiously:

               KAREN'S VOICE
      Where was she? Strange... I had
      become so accustomed to seeing her
      there night after night - I found
      myself looking for a girl I'd never
      spoken to, wondering where she
      was...

She smiles a little at her own romanticism, puts her head
down and makes her way into the alley. 

EXT. ALLEY - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT

Karen moves toward the stage door. She passes a recess in the
wall - perhaps an exit - about halfway. 

               EVE'S VOICE
          (softly)
      Mrs. Richards...

Karen hesitates, looks. Eve is barely distinguishable in the
shadow of the recess. Karen smiles, waits. Eve comes out. A
gooseneck light above them reveals her... 

She wears a cheap trench coat, low-heeled shoes, a rain hat
stuck on the back of her head... Her large, luminous eyes
seem to glow up at Karen in the strange half-light. 

               KAREN
      So there you are. It seemed odd,
      suddenly, your not being there...

               EVE
      Why should you think I wouldn't be?

               KAREN
      Why should you be? After all, six
      nights a week - for weeks - of
      watching even Margo Channing enter
      and leave a theater-

               EVE
      I hope you don't mind my speaking
      to you...

               KAREN
      Not at all. 

               EVE
      I've seen you so often - it took
      every bit of courage I could raise-

               KAREN
          (smiles)
      To speak to just a playwright's
      wife? I'm the lowest form of
      celebrity...

               EVE
      You're Margo Channing's best
      friend. You and your husband are
      always with her - and Mr.
      Sampson... what's he like?

               KAREN
          (grins)
      Bill Sampson? He's - he's a
      director.

               EVE
      He's the best. 

               KAREN
      He'll agree with you. Tell me, what
      do you between the time Margo goes
      in and comes out? Just huddle in
      that doorway and wait? 

               EVE
      Oh, no. I see the play. 

               KAREN
          (incredulous)
      You see the play? You've seen the
      play every performance?
          (Eve nods)
      But, don't you find it - I mean
      apart from everything else - don't
      you find it expensive? 

               EVE
      Standing room doesn't cost much. I
      manage. 

Karen contemplates Eve. Then she takes her arm. 

               KAREN
      I'm going to take you to Margo...

               EVE
          (hanging back)
      Oh, no...

               KAREN
      She's got to meet you-

               EVE
      No, I'd be imposing on her, I'd be
      just another tongue-tied gushing
      fan...

Karen practically propels her toward the stage door. 

               KAREN
          (insisting)
      There isn't another like you, there
      couldn't be- 

               EVE
      But if I'd known... maybe some
      other time... I mean, looking like
      this. 

               KAREN
      You look just fine...
          (they're at the stage
           door)
      ... by the way. What's your name?

               EVE
      Eve. Eve Harrington. 

Karen opens the door. They go in. 

INT. BACKSTAGE - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT

Everything, including the doorman, looks fireproof. 

Eve enters like a novitiate's first visit to the Vatican.
Karen, with a "Good evening, Gus -" to the doorman, leads the
way toward Margo's stage dressing room. Eve, drinking in the
wonderment of all the surveys, lags behind. Karen waits for
her to catch up... 

               EVE
      You can breathe it - can't you?
      Like some magic perfume...

Karen smiles, takes Eve's arm. They proceed to Margo's
dressing room. 

EXT. MARGO'S DRESSING ROOM - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT

No star on the closed door; the paint is peeling. A type
written chit, thumbtacked, says MISS CHANNING.

As Karen and Eve approach it, an uninhibited guffaw from
Margo makes them pause. 

               KAREN
          (whispers)
      You wait a minute...
          (smiles)
      ... now don't run away-

Eve smiles shakily. At the same moment:

               MARGO'S VOICE
          (loudly; through the door)
      "Honey chile," I said, "if the
      South had won the war, you could
      write the same plays about the
      North!"

Karen enters during the line. 

INT. MARGO'S DRESSING ROOM - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT

It is a medium-sized box, lined with hot water pipes and
cracked plaster. It is furnished in beat-up wicker. A door
leads to an old-fashioned bathroom. 

Margo is at the dressing table. She wears an old wrapper, her
hair drawn back tightly to fit under the wig which lies
before her like a dead poodle. Also before her is an almost
finished drink. 

LLOYD RICHARDS is stretched out on the wicker chaise. He's in
his late thirties, sensitive, literate. 

Between them, by the dressing table, is BIRDIE - Margo's
maid. Her age is unimportant. She was conceived during a
split week in Walla Walla and born in a carnival riot. She is
fiercely loyal to Margo. 

Karen enters during the line Margo started while she was
outside. Lloyd chuckles, Birdie cackles. 

               KAREN
      Hi.
          (she goes to kiss Lloyd)
      Hello, darling-

               MARGO 
      Hi. 
          (she goes right on - in a
           think "Suth'n" accent)
      "Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't
      think you can rightly say we lost
      the wah, we was mo' stahved out,
      you might say - an' that's what ah
      don' unnerstand about all these
      plays about love-stahved Suth'n
      women - love is one thing we was
      nevah stahved for the South!"

               LLOYD
      How was the concert?

               KAREN
      Loud.

               BIRDIE
      Lemme fix you a drink. 

               KAREN
      No thanks, Birdie. 

Karen laughs with them. 

               LLOYD
      Margo's interview with a lady
      reporter from the South-

               BIRDIE
      The minute it gets printed they're
      gonna fire on Gettysburg all over
      again...

               MARGO
      It was Fort Sumter they fired on-

               BIRDIE
      I never played Fort Sumter.

She takes the wig into the bathroom. Margo starts creaming
the make-up off her face. 

               MARGO
      Honey chili had a point. You know,
      I can remember plays about women -
      even from the South - where it
      never even occurred to them whether
      they wanted to marry their fathers
      more than their brothers...

               LLOYD
      That was way back...

               MARGO
      Within your time, buster. Lloyd,
      honey, be a playwright with guts.
      Write me one about a nice, normal
      woman who shoots her husband. 

Birdie comes out of the bathroom without the wig. 

               BIRDIE
      You need new girdles. 

               MARGO
      Buy some. 

               BIRDIE
      The same size? 

               MARGO
      Of course!

               BIRDIE
      Well. I guess a real tight girdle
      help when you're playin' a lunatic.  

She picks up Lloud empty glass, asks "more"? He shakes his
head. She pours herself a quick one. 

               KAREN
          (firmly)
      Margo does not play a lunatic,
      Birdie. 

               BIRDIE
      I know. She just keeps hearin' her
      dead father play the banjo. 

               MARGO
      It's the tight girdle that does it. 

               KAREN
      I find these wisecracks
      increasingly less funny! 'Aged in
      Wood' happens to be a fine and
      distinguished play-

               LLOYD
      - 'at's my loyal little woman. 

               KAREN
      The critics thought so, the
      audiences certainly think so -
      packed houses, tickets for months
      in advance - I can't see that
      either of Lloyd's last two plays
      have hurt you any!

               LLOYD
      Easy, now...

               MARGO
          (grins)
      Relax, kid. It's only me and my big
      mouth...

               KAREN
          (mollified)
      It's just that you get me so mad
      sometimes... of all the women in
      the world with nothing to complain
      about-

               MARGO
          (dryly)
      Ain't it the truth?

               KAREN
      Yes, it is! You're talented,
      famous, wealthy - people waiting
      around night after night just to
      see you, even in the wind and
      rain...

               MARGO
      Autograph fiends! They're not
      people - those little beast who run
      in packs like coyotes-

               KAREN
      They're your fans, your audience-

               MARGO
      They're nobody's fans! They're
      juvenile delinquents, mental
      detectives, they're nobody's
      audience, they never see a play or
      a movie, even - they're never
      indoors long enough!

There is a pause. Lloyd applauds lightly. 

               KAREN
      Well... there's one indoors now.
      I've brought her back to see you. 

               MARGO
      You've what? 

               KAREN
          (in a whisper)
      She's just outside the door. 

               MARGO
          (to Birdie; also a
           whisper)
      The heave-ho. 

Birdie starts. Karen stops her. It's all in whisper, now,
until Eve comes in. 

               KAREN
      You can't put her out, I
      promised... Margo, you've got to
      see her, she worships you, it's
      like something out of a book-

               LLOYD
      That book is out of print, Karen,
      those days are gone.
      Fans no longer pull the carriage
      through the streets - they tear off
      clothes and steal wrist watches...

               KAREN
      If you'd only see her, you're her
      whole life - you must have spotted
      her by now, she's always there...

               MARGO
      Kind of mousy trench coat and funny
      hat?
          (Karen nods)
      How could I miss her? Every night
      and matinee - well...

She looks to Birdie. 

               BIRDIE
      Once George Jessel played my
      hometown. For a girl, gettin' in to
      see him was easy. Gettin' out was
      the problem...

They all laugh. Karen goes to the door, opens it. Eve comes
in. Karen closes the door behind her. A moment. 

               EVE
          (simply)
      I thought you'd forgotten about me. 

               KAREN
      Not at all. 
          (her arm through Eve's)
      Margo, this is Eve Harrington. 

Margo changes swiftly into a first-lady-of-the-theater
manner. 

               MARGO
          (musically)
      How do you do, my dear. 

               BIRDIE
          (mutters)
      Oh, brother. 

               EVE
      Hello, Miss Channing. 

               KAREN
      My husband...

               LLOYD
          (nicely)
      Hello, Miss Harrington. 

               EVE
      How do you do, Mr. Richards. 

               MARGO
          (graciously)
      And this is my good friend and
      companion, Miss Birdie Coonan.

               BIRDIE
      Oh, brother. 

               MARGO
      Miss Coonan...

               LLOYD
          (to Birdie)
      Oh brother what? 

               BIRDIE
      When she gets like this... all of a
      sudden she's playin' Hamlet's
      mother...

               MARGO
          (quiet menace)
      I'm sure you must have things to do
      in the bathroom, Birdie dear. 

               BIRDIE
      If I haven't, I'll find something
      till you're normal.

She goes into the bathroom. 

               MARGO
      Dear Birdie. Won't you sit down,
      Miss Worthington? 

               KAREN
      Harrington. 

               MARGO
      I'm so sorry... Harrington. Won't
      you sit down? 

               EVE
      Thank you. 

She sits. A short lull.

               MARGO
      Would you like a drink? It's right
      beside you... 

               KAREN
      I was telling Margo and Lloyd about
      how often you'd seen the play...

They start together, and stop in deference to each other.
They're a little flustered. But not Eve. 

               EVE
          (to Margo)
      No, thank you.
          (to Lloyd)
      Yes. I've seen every performance. 

               LLOYD
          (delighted)
      Every performance? Then - am I safe
      in assuming you like it? 

               EVE
      I'd like anything Miss Channing
      played...

               MARGO
          (beams)
      Would you, really? How sweet-

               LLOYD
          (flatly)
      I doubt very much that you'd like
      her in 'The Hairy Ape'.

               EVE
      Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr.
      Richards. I think that part of Miss
      Channing's greatness lies in her
      ability to choose the best plays...
      your new play is for Miss Channing,
      isn't it, Mr. Richards?

               MARGO
      Of course it is.

               LLOYD
      How'd hear about it?

               EVE
      There was an item in the Times. i
      like the title. 'Footsteps on the
      Ceiling'.

               LLOYD
      Let's get back to this one. Have
      you really seen every performance? 
          (Eve nods)
      Why? I'm curious...

Eve looks at Margo, then drops her eyes. 

               EVE
      Well. If I didn't come to see the
      play, I wouldn't have anywhere else
      to go. 

               MARGO
      There are other plays...

               EVE
      Not with you in them. Not by Mr.
      Richards...

               LLOYD
      But you must have friends, a
      family, a home-

Eve pauses. Then shakes her head. 

               KAREN
      Tell us about it - Eve...

Eve looks at her - grateful because Karen called her "Eve."
Then away, again...

               EVE
      If I only knew how...

               KAREN
      Try...

               EVE
      Well...

Birdie comes out of the bathroom. Everybody looks at her
sharply. She realizes she's in on something important. She
closes the door quietly, leans against it.

               EVE
      Well... it started with the play
      before this one...

               LLOYD
      'Remembrance'.

               MARGO
      Did you see it here in New York?

               EVE
      San Francisco. It was the last
      week. I went one night... the most
      important night in my life - until
      this one. Anyway... I found myself
      going the next night - and the next
      and the next. Every performance.
      Then, when the show went East - I
      went East. 

               BIRDIE
      I'll never forget that blizzard the
      night we played Cheyenne. A cold
      night. First time I ever saw a
      brassiere break like a piece of
      matzos... 

Eve looks at her unsmilingly, then back to her hands. 

               KAREN
      Eve... why don't you start at the
      beginning? 

               EVE
      It couldn't possibly interest you. 

               MARGO
      Please...

Eve speaks simply and without self-pity. 

               EVE
      I guess it started back home.
      Wisconsin, that is. There was just
      mum, and dad - and me. I was the
      only child, and I made believe a
      lot when I was a kid - I acted out
      all sorts of things... what they
      were isn't important. But somehow
      acting and make-believe began to
      fill up my life more and more, it
      got so that I couldn't tell the
      real from the unreal except that
      the unreal seemed more real to
      me... I'm talking a lot of
      gibberish, aren't I? 

               LLOYD
      Not at all...

               EVE
      Farmers were poor in those days,
      that's what dad was - a farmer. I
      had to help out. So I quit school
      and I went to Milwaukee. I became a
      secretary. In a brewery.
          (she smiles)
      When you're a secretary in a
      brewery - it's pretty hard to make
      believe you're anything else.
      Everything is beer. It wasn't much
      fun, but it helped at home -  and
      there was a Little Theater Group...
      like a drop of rain in the desert.
      That's where I met Eddie. He was a
      radio technician. We played
      'Liliom' for three performances, I
      was awful - then the war came, and
      we got married. Eddie was in the
      air force - and they sent him to
      the South Pacific. You were with
      the O.W.I., weren't you Mr.
      Richards?
          (Lloyd nods)
      That's what 'Who's Who' says...
      well, with Eddie gone, my life went
      back to beer. Except for a letter a
      week. One week Eddie wrote he had a
      leave coming up. I'd saved my money
      and vacation time. I went to San
      Francisco to meet him. 
          (a slight pause)
      Eddie wasn't there. They forwarded
      the telegram from Milwaukee - the
      one that came from Washington to
      say that Eddie wasn't coming at
      all. That Eddie was dead...
          (Karen puts her hand on
           Lloyd's)
      ... so I figured I'd stay in San
      Francisco. i was alone, but
      couldn't go back without Eddie. I
      found a job. And his insurance
      helped... and there were theaters
      in San Francisco. And one night
      Margo Channing came to play in
      'Remembrance'... and I went to see
      it. And - well - here I am...

She finishes dry-eyes and self-composed. Margo squeezes the
bridge of her nose, dabs at her eyes. 

               BIRDIE
          (finally)
      What a story. Everything but the
      bloodhounds snappin' at her rear
      end...

That breaks the spell. Margo turns to her-

               MARGO
      There are some human experiences,
      Birdie, that do not take place in a
      vaudeville house - and that even a
      fifth-rate vaudevillian should
      understand and respect!
          (to Eve)
      I want to apologize for Birdie's-

               BIRDIE
          (snaps in)
      You don't have to apologize for me!
          (to Eve)
      I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.
      It's just my way of talkin'...

               EVE
          (nicely)
      You didn't hurt my feelings, Miss
      Coonan...

               BIRDIE
      Call me Birdie. 
          (to Margo)
      As for bein' fifth-rate - i closed
      the first half for eleven years an'
      you know it!

She slams into the bathroom again. At that precise instant
BILL SAMPSON flings open the door to the dressing room. He's
youngish, vital, undisciplined. He lugs a beat-up suitcase
which he drops as he crosses to Margo-

               BILL
      Forty-five minutes from now my
      plane takes off and how do I find
      you? Not ready yet, looking like a
      junk yard-

               MARGO
      Thank you so much. 

               BILL
      Is it sabotage, does my career mean
      nothing to you? Have you no human
      consideration? 

               MARGO
      Show me a human and I might have!

               KAREN
          (conscious of Eve)
      Bill...

               BILL
      The air lines have clocks, even if
      you haven't! I start shooting a
      week from Monday - Zanuck is
      impatient, he wants me, he needs
      me!

               KAREN
          (louder)
      Bill-

               MARGO
      Zanuck, Zanuck, Zanuck! What are
      you two - lovers? 

Bill grins suddenly, drops to one knee beside her.

               BILL
          (smiling)
      Only in some ways. You're
      prettier...

               MARGO
      I'm a junk yard. 

               KAREN
          (yells)
      Bill!

               BILL
          (vaguely; to Karen)
      Huh?

               KAREN
      This is Eve Harrington.

Bill flashes a fleeting look at Eve. 

               BILL
      Hi.
          (to Margo)
      My wonderful junk yard. The mystery
      and dreams you find in a junk yard-

               MARGO
          (kisses him)
      Heaven help me, I love a psychotic. 

Bill grins, rises, sees Eve as if for the first time. 

               BILL
      Hello, what's your name? 

               EVE
      Eve. Eve Harrington. 

               KAREN
      You've already met. 

               BILL
      Where? 

               KAREN
      Right here. A minute ago. 

               BILL
      That's nice. 

               MARGO
      She, too, is a great admirer of
      yours. 

               BIRDIE
      Imagine. All this admiration in
      just one room. 

               BILL
      Take your mistress into the
      bathroom and dress her.
          (Birdie opens her mouth)
      Without comment. 

Birdie shuts it and goes into the bathroom. In a moment we
hear a shower start to run. Eve gets up. 

               KAREN
      You're not going, are you?

               EVE
      I think I'd better. It's been -
      well, I can hardly find the words
      to say how it's been...

               MARGO
          (rises)
      No, don't go...

               EVE
      The four of you must have so much
      to say to each other - with Mr.
      Sampson leaving...

Margo, impulsively crosses to Eve. 

               MARGO
      Stick around. Please. Tell you what
      - we'll put Stanislavsky on his
      plane, you and I, then go somewhere
      and talk. 

               EVE
      Well - if I'm not in the way...

               MARGO
      I won't be a minute. 

She darts into the bathroom. Eve sits down again. 

               KAREN
      Lloyd, we've got to go-

Lloyd gets up. Karen crosses to pound on the bathroom door.
She yells - the shower is going...

               KAREN
      Margo, good night! I'll call you
      tomorrow!

Margo's answer is lost in the shower noise. Karen crosses to
kiss Bill. She's joined by Lloyd. 

               KAREN
      Good luck, genius...

               BILL
      Geniuses don't need good luck.
          (he grins)
      I do. 

               LLOYD
      I'm not worried about you. 

               BILL
      Keep the thought. 

They shake hands warmly. Karen and Lloyd move to Eve. 

               KAREN
      Good night, Eve. I hope I see you
      again soon-

               EVE
      I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow
      matinee-

               KAREN
      Not just that way. As a friend...

               EVE
      I'd like that. 

               LLOYD
      It's been a real pleasure, Eve. 

               EVE
      I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good
      night...

Lloyd shakes her hand, crosses to join Karen who waits at the
open dressing room door. 

               EVE
      Mrs. Richards.
          (Karen and Lloyd look
           back)
      ... I'll never forget this night as
      long as I live. And I'll never
      forget you for making it possible. 

Karen smiles warmly. She closes the door. They leave. 

               KAREN'S VOICE
      - and I'll never forget you, Eve.
      Where were we going that night,
      Lloyd and I? Funny the things you
      remember - and the things you
      don't...

INT. MARGO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Eve sits on the same chair. Bill keeps moving around. Eve
never takes her eyes off him. He offers her a cigarette. She
shakes her head. He looks at his watch. 

               EVE
      You said forty-seven minutes.
      You'll never make it. 

               BILL
          (grins)
      I told you a lie. We'll make it
      easily. Margo's got no more
      conception of time than a halibut. 

He goes to the dressing table, picks up Margo's pocketbook,
opens it. He finds a letter. He glances at it, puts it back.

               BILL
      She's been carrying that letter
      around for weeks. I've read it
      three times...

There's a sudden sharp yelp from the bathroom. 

               MARGO'S VOICE
      You're supposed to zip the zipper -
      not me. 

               BIRDIE'S VOICE
      Like tryin' to zip a pretzel -
      stand still!

Bill grins. 

               BILL
      What a documentary those two would
      make... like the mongoose and the
      cobra-

He sprawls on the chaise, closes his eyes. A pause.

               EVE
          (finally)
      So you're going to Hollywood.

Bill grunts in the affirmative. Silence. 

               BILL
      Why?

               EVE
      I just wondered.

               BILL
      Just wondered what?

               EVE
      Why.

               BILL
      Why what?

               EVE
      Why you have to go out there.

               BILL
      I don't have to. I want to.

               EVE
      Is it the money?

               BILL
      Eighty percent of it will go for
      taxes. 

               EVE
      Then why? Why, if you're the best
      and most successful young director
      in the Theater-

               BILL
      The Theatuh, the Theatuh-
          (he sits up)
      - what book of rules says the
      Theater exists only within some
      ugly buildings crowded into one
      square mile of New York City? Or
      London, Paris or Vienna?
          (he gets up)
      Listen, junior. And learn. Want to
      know what the Theater is? A flea
      circus. Also opera. Also rodeos,
      carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal
      dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man
      band - all Theater. Wherever
      there's magic and make-believe and
      an audience - there's Theater.
      Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone
      Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles
      Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty
      Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora
      Duse. You don't understand them
      all, you don't like them all, why
      should you? The Theater's for
      everybody - you included, but not
      exclusively - so don't approve or
      disapprove. It may not be your
      Theater, but it's Theater of
      somebody, somewhere. 

               EVE
      I just asked a simple question. 

               BILL
          (grins)
      And I shot my mouth off. Nothing
      personal, junior, no offense...
          (he sits back down)
      ... it's just that there's so much
      bushwah in this Ivory Green Room
      they call the Theatuh - sometimes
      it gets up around my chin...

He lies down again. 

               EVE
      But Hollywood. You mustn't stay
      there. 

               BILL
          (he closes his eyes)
      It's only one picture deal. 

               EVE
      So few come back...

               BILL
      Yeah. They keep you under drugs out
      there with armed guards...

A pause.

               EVE
      I read George Jean Nathan every
      week.

               BILL
      Also Addison deWitt. 

               EVE
      Every day. 

               BILL
      You didn't have to tell me. 

Margo, putting on an earring, buzzes out of the bathroom
followed by Birdie. Bill sits up. 

               MARGO
          (en route)
      I understand it's the latest thing -
      just one earring. If it isn't, it's
      going to be - I can't find the
      other...

She grabs her pocketbook, starts rummaging. Out comes the
letter...

               BILL
      Throw that dreary thing away, it
      bores me-

Margo drops it in the wastebasket, keeps rummaging. 

               EVE
          (concerned)
      Where do you suppose it could be?

               BIRDIE
      It'll show up.

               MARGO
          (gives up)
      Oh well...
          (to Birdie)
      ... look through the wigs, maybe it
      got caught-

               BILL
      Real diamonds in a wig. The world
      we live in...

               MARGO
          (she's been looking)
      Where's my coat?

               BIRDIE
      Right where you left it...

She goes behind the chaise. She comes up with a magnificent
mink. 

               BILL
          (to Margo)
      The seams. 

Margo starts to straighten them. 

               MARGO
          (to Eve)
      Can't keep his eyes off my legs. 

               BILL
      Like a nylon lemon peel-

               MARGO
          (straightens up)
      Byron couldn't have said it more
      graciously... here we go-

By now she's in the coat and has Eve's arm, heading for the
door. Bill puts his arms around Birdie. 

               BILL
      Got any messages? What do you want
      me to tell Tyrone Power?

               BIRDIE
      Just give him my phone number, I'll
      tell him myself. 

Bill kisses her cheek. She kisses Bill. 

               BIRDIE
      Kill the people. 
          (to Margo)
      Got your key?

               MARGO
          (nods)
      See you home...

Margo and Eve precede Bill out of the door...

EXT. LAGUARDIA FIELD - NIGHT

American Airlines baggage counter. The rain has stopped, but
it's wet. 

Margo, Eve, and Bill are stymied behind two or three couples
waiting to be checked in. Margo's arm is through Bill's. They
become increasingly aware of their imminent separation. Eve
senses her superfluity. 

A lull. Bill cranes at the passenger heading the line, in
earnest conversation with the dispatcher. He sighs. 

               MARGO
      They have to time it so everybody
      gets on at the last minute. So they
      can close the doors and let you
      sit. 

The man up ahead moves on.

               BILL
      Ah...

               EVE
      I have a suggestion.
          (they look at her)
      There's really not much time left -
      I mean, you haven't had a minute
      alone yet, and - well, I could take
      care of everything here and meet
      you at the gate with the ticket...
      if you'd like. 

               BILL
      I think we'd like very much. Sure
      you won't mind?

               EVE
      Of course not. 

Bill hands Eve the ticket. Margo smiles gratefully at her.
Eve smiles back. 

EXT. PASSAGE AND GATE - LAGUARDIA - NIGHT

It's covered, with glass windows. Margo's arm is in Bill's. 

               BILL
      She's quite a girl, that what's-her
      name...

               MARGO
      Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that
      way...

               BILL
      The lack of pretense, that sort of
      strange directness and
      understanding-

               MARGO
      Did she tell you about the Theater
      and what it meant? 

               BILL
          (grins)
      I told her. I sounded off. 

               MARGO
      All the religions in the world
      rolled into one, and we're Gods and
      Goddesses... isn't it silly,
      suddenly I've developed a big
      protective feeling for her - a lamb
      loose in our big stone jungle...

Bill pauses and pulls her to one side. Some passengers go by.
A pause. 

               MARGO
      Take care of yourself out there...

               BILL
      I understand they've got the
      Indians pretty well in hand...

               MARGO
      Bill...

               BILL
      Huh?

               MARGO
      Don't get stuck on some glamour
      puss-

               BILL
      I'll try.

               MARGO
      You're not such a bargain, you
      know, conceited and thoughtless and
      messy-

               BILL
      Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.

               MARGO
      - you're a setup for some gorgeous
      wide-eyed young babe.

               BILL
      How childish are you going to get
      before you quit it? 

               MARGO
      I don't want to be childish, I'd
      settle for just a few years-

               BILL
          (firmly)
      And cut that out right now. 

               MARGO
      Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?

               BILL
      As of this moment you're six years
      old...

He starts to kiss her, stops when he becomes aware of Eve
standing near them. She has his ticket in her hand. 

               EVE
      All ready.

She hands Bill his ticket, they start toward the gate. 

INT. BOARDING GATE - LAGUARDIA - NIGHT

The D.C. 6 in the b.g. A few visitors. Bill hands his ticket
to the guard, turns to Eve. 

               BILL
      Thanks for your help... good luck. 

               EVE
      Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.

Bill puts his arms around Margo. 

               BILL
      Knit me a muffler. 

               MARGO
      Call me when you get in...

They kiss. Margo's arms tighten desperately. Bill pulls away,
kisses her again lightly, starts for the plane. Margo turns
away. Eve puts her arms through Margo's. 

Bill pauses en route to the plane. 

               BILL
      Hey - junior...

Margo turns to look at him with Eve. 

               BILL
      Keep your eyes on her. Don't let
      her get lonely. She's a loose lamb
      in a jungle...

Eve looks at Margo. Margo smiles. 

               EVE
      Don't worry...

Bill waves, climbs aboard. The door is closed behind him, the
departure routine starts...

Margo and eve turn to go. They walk down the passage. As they
walk, Eve gently disengages her arm from Margo's and puts it
comfortingly about her...

               MARGO'S VOICE
      That same night we sent for Eve's
      things, her few pitiful
      possessions... she moved into the
      little guest room on the top
      floor...

INT. DINING HALL - NIGHT

MARGO slides her fingers reflectively up and down the sides
of the almost empty highball glass. 

               MARGO'S VOICE
      ... she cried when she saw it - it
      was so like her little room back
      home in Wisconsin.

ADDISON eyeing her quizzically. He offers her the whiskey. 

MARGO shakes her head, absently. She looks down at her glass
again. Then, she raises her eyes to look at Eve. 

               MARGO'S VOICE
      ... the next three weeks were out
      of a fairy tale - and I was
      Cinderella in the last act. Eve
      became my sister, lawyer, mother,
      friend, psychiatrist and cop - the
      honeymoon was on...

INT. MARGO'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

It's one floor above street level. A long narrow room,
smartly furnished - including a Sarah Siddons Award. 

MARGO'S NARRATIVE overlaps into the scene which is a SILENT
ONE. 

Eve sits at a smart desk. She is just arranging a stack of
letters which she carries to Margo with a pen. Margo sits
comfortably by the fire with a play script. She hands the
scrips up to Eve, shakes her head and holds her nose. Eve
smiles, takes the script, hands Margo the letters to sign.

Birdie comes in with a tea tray which she sets on a low table
before the fire. 

The phone rings.

Birdie and Eve both go for it. Eve gets there first. By her
polite but negative attitude, we know she is giving someone a
skillful brush-off.

Birdie glares first at her, then at Margo. 

Margo leans her head back, closes her eyes blissfully...

Birdie slams the double door to the landing on her way out...

INT. BACKSTAGE - CURRAN THEATER - DAY

From the wings. The audience is never visible. Eve in the
f.g. Margo and company taking a curtain call. Tumultuous
applause... the curtain falls. The cast, except for Margo and
two male leads, walk off. The curtain rises again...

EVE, watching and listening to the storm of applause. Her
eyes shine, she clasps and unclasps her hands...

THE STAGE, Eve again in the f.g., but closer. Again the
curtain falls. This time the two men go off. Curtain rises on
Margo alone. If anything, the applause builds...

EVE, that same hypnotic look... there are tears in her eyes.
The curtain falls offscene, then rises again - 

MARGO, the curtain falls again between her and CAMERA...

BACKSTAGE, the curtain just settling on the floor. Margo
starts off. 

               STAGE MANAGER
      One more?

               MARGO
          (shakes her head)
      From now on it's not applause -
      just something to do till the
      aisles get less crowded...

She walks as she talks and winds up at Eve - still in the
wings. Eve's eyes are wet, she dabs at her nose. 

               MARGO
      What - again?

               EVE
      I could watch you play that last
      scene a thousand times and cry
      every time-

               MARGO
          (grins)
      Performance number one thousand of
      this one - if I play it that long -
      will take place in a well-padded
      booby hatch...

She takes Eve's arm, they stroll toward her dressing room. 

               EVE
      I must say you can certainly tell
      Mr. Sampson's been gone a month. 

               MARGO
      You certainly can. Especially if
      you're me between now and tomorrow
      morning...

               EVE
      I mean the performance. Except for
      you, you'd think he'd never even
      directed it - it's disgraceful the
      way they change everything
      around...

               MARGO
          (smiles)
      Well, teacher's away and actors
      will be actors...

               EVE
      During your second act scene with
      your father, Roger Ferraday's
      supposed to stay way upstage at the
      arch. He's been coming closer down
      every night...

               MARGO
      When he gets too close, I'll spit
      in his eye.

They're at her dressing room by now. Margo's been unhooking
her gown, with Eve's help. They go in. 

INT. MARGO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

It's undergone quite a change. A new carpet, chintz covers
for the furniture, new lampshades, dainty curtains across the
filthy barred window. 

Birdie waits within. She's listening to a fight; she shuts it
off as they enter.

               MARGO
          (entering)
      You bought the new girdles a size
      smaller. I can feel it. 

               BIRDIE
      Something maybe grew a size bigger.

               MARGO
      When we get home you're going to
      get into one of those girdles and
      act for two and half hours. 

               BIRDIE
      I couldn't get into the girdle in
      two an' a half hours...

Margo's out of her wig and dress by now. She gets into her
robe, sits at the dressing table. Eve's on the chaise, by the
discarded costume.

               EVE
      You haven't noticed my latest bit
      of interior decorating...

               MARGO
          (turns, looks)
      Well, you've done so much... what's
      new? 

               EVE
      The curtains. I made them myself. 

               MARGO
      They are lovely. Aren't they
      lovely, Birdie? 

               BIRDIE
      Adorable. We now got everything a
      dressing room needs except a
      basketball hoop. 

               MARGO
      Just because you can't even work a
      zipper. It was very thoughtful,
      Eve, and I appreciate it- 

A pause. Eve rises, picking up Margo's costume.

               EVE
      While you're cleaning up, I'll take
      this to the wardrobe mistress-

               MARGO
      Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be
      along for it in a minute. 

               EVE
      No trouble at all. 

And she goes out with the costume. Birdie opens her mouth,
shuts it, then opens it again. 

               BIRDIE
      If I may so bold as to say
      something - did you ever hear the
      word "union"?

               MARGO
      Behind in your dues? How much?

               BIRDIE
      I haven't got a union. I'm slave
      labor. 

               MARGO
      Well?

               BIRDIE
      But the wardrobe women have got
      one. And next to a tenor, a
      wardrobe woman is the touchiest
      thing in show business-

               MARGO
          (catching on)
      Oh-oh.

               BIRDIE
      She's got two things to do - carry
      clothes an' press 'em wrong - an'
      just let anybody else muscle in...

As she talks, Margo hurries to the door and out after Eve. 

INT. BACKSTAGE - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT

Margo pops out, looks for Eve, then stares in amazement. 

EVE, near the wings. She stands before a couple of cheval
mirrors set up for cast members. She has Margo's dress held
up against her body. She turns this way and that, bows as if
to applause - mimicking Margo exactly...

MARGO watches her curiously. Then she smiles. 

               MARGO
          (calling)
      Eve-

EVE, startled, whips the gown away, turns to Margo. 

MARGO smiles understandingly. 

               MARGO
          (quietly)
      I think we'd better let Mrs. Brown
      pick up the wardrobe...

Wordlessly, Eve brings it toward her...

INT. MARGO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Margo's asleep. A bedside clock with a luminous dial reads 3
A.M. exactly. The phone rings. Her head comes up out of the
pillow, she shakes it. She fumbles, switches on a lamp, then
picks up the phone. 

               MARGO
      Hello..

               OPERATOR'S VOICE
      We are ready with your call to
      Beverly Hills...

               MARGO
      Call, what call?

               OPERATOR'S VOICE
      It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo
      Channing? 

               MARGO
      That's right, but I don't
      understand-

               OPERATOR'S VOICE
      We are ready with the call you
      placed for 12 midnight, California
      time, to Mr. William Sampson in
      Beverly Hills...

               MARGO
      I placed...?

               OPERATOR'S VOICE
      Go ahead, please...

               BILL'S VOICE
          (a loud, happy squawk)
      Margo! What a wonderful surprise!

Margo jumps at his vehemence. As she does so, the SCREEN
WIPES DOWN DIAGONALLY LEFT TO RIGHT, so that Margo remains in
the lower right-hand diagonal of the screen and Bill is
disclosed in the upper left. He, too, is in bed, reading. His
clock says midnight. 

               BILL
          (continuing)
      What a thoughtful, ever-lovin'
      thing to do-

               MARGO
          (dazed)
      Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?

               BILL
      You're my girl, aren't you?

               MARGO
      That I am...

               BILL
      Then you're crazy. 

               MARGO
          (nods in agreement)
      When - when are you coming back? 

               BILL 
      I leave in a week - the picture's
      all wrapped up, we previewed last
      night... those previews. Like
      opening out of town, but
      terrifying. There's nothing you can
      do, you're trapped, you're in a tin
      can-

               MARGO
      - in a tin can, cellophane or
      wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want
      you home...

               BILL 
      You in a hurry?

               MARGO
      A big hurry, be quick about it - so
      good night, darling, and sleep
      tight...

               BILL 
      Wait a minute! You can't hang up,
      you haven't even said it-

               MARGO
      Bill, you know how much I do - but
      over the phone, now really, that's
      kid stuff...

               BILL
      Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen
      every day, I want to heat it - and
      if you won't say it, you can sing
      it...

               MARGO
          (convinced she's gone mad)
      Sing it?

               BILL 
      Sure! Like the Western Union boys
      used to do...

Margo's eyes pop. Her jaw and the phone sag. 

               MARGO
      Bill... Bill, it's your birthday. 

               BILL 
      And who remembered it? Who was
      there on the dot, at twelve
      midnight...?

Margo knows damn well it wasn't she. 

               MARGO
          (miserably)
      Happy birthday, darling...

               BILL 
      The reading could have been better,
      but you said it - now "many happy
      returns of the day..."

               MARGO
          (the same)
      Many happy returns of the day...

               BILL 
      I get a party, don't I?

               MARGO
      Of course, birthday and welcome
      home... who'll I ask?

               BILL 
          (laughs)
      It's no secret, I know all about
      the party - Eve wrote me...

               MARGO
      She did...?

                BILL 
      She hasn't missed a week since I
      left - but you know all that, you
      probably tell her what to write...
      anyway, I sent her a list of people
      to ask - check with her. 

               MARGO
      Yeah... I will.

               BILL 
      How is Eve? Okay?

               MARGO
      Okay. 

               BILL 
      I love you...

               MARGO
          (mutters)
      I'll check with Eve...

               BILL
      What? 

               MARGO
      I love you too. Good night, darling-

               BILL 
      See you...

Margo hangs up. Bill hangs up. He replaces the phone, picks
up his book... SLOW WIPE until ONLY MARGO is on screen. She
puts her phone away. She gets a cigarette. She lights it. She
rolls over on her back...

INT. MARGO'S BEDROOM - DAY

Margo is propped up in bed, still reflective. Birdie comes in
with her breakfast tray and a "hi" which gets a "hi" from
Margo. She starts on some petty chores. Margo takes a sip of
orange juice...

               MARGO
      Birdie-

               BIRDIE
      Hmm?

               MARGO
      You don't like Eve, do you?

               BIRDIE
      Do you want an argument or an
      answer?

               MARGO
      An answer. 

               BIRDIE
      No. 

               MARGO
      Why not?

               BIRDIE
      Now you want an argument. 

               MARGO
      She works hard. 

               BIRDIE
      Night an' day. 

               MARGO
      She's loyal and efficient-

               BIRDIE
      Like an agent with one client.

               MARGO
      She thinks only for me...
          (no answer from Birdie)
      ... doesn't she? 

               BIRDIE
          (finally)
      Well... let's say she thinks only
      about you, anyway...

               MARGO
      How do you mean that?

Birdie stops whatever it is she's doing.

               BIRDIE
      I'll tell you how. Like - let's see
      - like she was studyin' you, like
      you were a play or a book or a set
      of blueprints. How you walk, talk,
      think, eat, sleep-

               MARGO
          (breaks in; sharply)
      I'm sure that's very flattering,
      Birdie, and I'm sure there's
      nothing wrong with that!

There is a sharp, brisk knock. Eve comes in. She's dressed in
a smart suit. She carries a leather portfolio.

               EVE
      Good morning!

Margo says "good morning," Birdie says nothing. Eve shows off
the suit, proudly. 

               EVE
      Well - what do you think of my
      elegant new suit? 

               MARGO
      Very becoming. It looks better on
      you than it did on me. 

               EVE
          (scoffs)
      I can imagine... you know, all it
      needed was some taking in here and
      letting out there - are you sure
      you won't want it yourself? 

               MARGO
      Quite sure. I find it just a bit
      too - too "Seventeenish" for me...

               EVE 
          (laughs)
      Oh, come now, as though you were an
      old lady... I'm on my way. Is there
      anything more you've thought of-?

               MARGO
      There's the script to go back to
      the Guild-

               EVE
      I've got it. 

               MARGO
      - and those checks or whatever it
      is for the income tax man. 

               EVE
      Right here. 

               MARGO
      It seems I can't think of a thing
      you haven't thought of...

               EVE
          (smile)
      That's my job.
          (she turns to go)
      See you at tea time...

               MARGO
      Eve...
          (Eve turns at the door)
      ... by any chance, did you place a
      call from me to Bill for midnight
      California time? 

               EVE
          (gasps)
      Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-

               MARGO
      Yes, dear. You forgot all about it. 

               EVE
      Well, I was sure you'd want to, of
      course, being his birthday, and
      you've been so busy these past few
      days, and last night I meant to
      tell you before you went out with
      the Richards - and I guess I was
      asleep when you got home...

               MARGO
      Yes, I guess you were. It - it was
      very thoughtful of you, Eve. 

               EVE
      Mr. Sampson's birthday. I certainly
      wouldn't forget that. You'd never
      forgive me. 
          (she smiles shyly)
      As a matter of fact, I sent him a
      telegram myself...

And she's gone. Margo stares at the closed door. Then at
Birdie. Birdie, without comment, goes out. Margo, alone,
looks down at her orange juice. Absently, she twirls it in
its bed of shaved ice...

INT. DINING HALL - SARAH SIDDONS SOCIETY - NIGHT

MARGO, reflectively twirling her highball glass. The applause
continues. She lifts her glass to drink. Her glance meets
Karen's. She raises the glass in a silent toast.   

KAREN smiles wanly at Margo's toast. Then the smile fades as
she looks reflectively back to Eve...

               KAREN'S VOICE
      I saw Eve quite often after our
      first meeting, but we never really
      talked again - until the party
      Margo gave for Bill when he
      returned from Hollywood...

INT. MARGO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's January. The bed is littered with fur coats. Through the
open door, from the floor below, the murmur of a party at a
late hour. No hilarity. 

               KAREN'S VOICE
      It's always convenient at a party
      to know the hostess well enough to
      use her bedroom rather than go
      where all the others have to go...

Karen is making repairs at Margo's dressing table. Eve
enters, carrying a magnificent sable coat which she drops on
the bed. 

               KAREN
      Now who's show up at this hour?
      It's time people went home - hold
      that coat up...
          (Eve holds it up; Karen
           whistles)
      ... whose is it? 

               EVE
      Some Hollywood movie star, her
      plane got in late. 

               KAREN
      Discouraging, isn't it? Women with
      furs like that where it never gets
      cold...

               EVE
      Hollywood. 

               KAREN
      Tell me, Eve - how are things with
      you? Happy? 

Eve melts into warmth. She beams, sits on the bed. Karen has
spun around on the dressing table stool. 

               EVE
      There should be a new word for
      happiness. Being here with Miss
      Channing has been - I just can't
      say, she's been so wonderful, done
      so much for me-

               KAREN
          (smiles)
      Lloyd says Margo compensates for
      underplaying on the stage by
      overplaying reality...
          (she gets up, gets her
           coat)
      ... next to that sable, my new mink
      seems like an old bedjacket... 
          (throws it over her
           shoulder)
      ... you've done your share, Eve.
      You've worked wonders with Margo...

She starts out. 

               EVE
          (hesitantly)
      Mrs. Richards. 

               KAREN
          (pauses, smiles)
      Karen.

               EVE
      Karen...
          (she picks at the
           coverlet)
      ... isn't it awful, I'm about to
      ask you for another favor - after
      all you've already done. 

               KAREN
          (crosses to her)
      Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've
      got to stop thinking of yourself as
      one of the Hundred Neediest
      Cases... what is it? 

               EVE
      Well... Miss Channing's affairs are
      in such good shape... there isn't
      enough to keep me as busy as I
      should be, really - not that I've
      ever considered anything that would
      take me away from her... but the
      other day - when I heard Mr. Fabian
      tell Miss Channing that her
      understudy was going to have a
      baby, and they'd have to replace
      her... 

She looks down at the coverlet once more. 

               KAREN
      ... you want to be Margo's new
      understudy. 

               EVE
      I don't let myself think about it,
      even- 
          (she looks up, rises as
           she speaks)
      - but I do know the part so well,
      and every bit of the staging,
      there'd be no need to break in a
      new girl-
          (suddenly afraid, she
           sits)
      - but suppose I had to go on one
      night? To an audience that came to
      see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't
      possibly...

               KAREN
          (laughs)
      Don't worry too much about that.
      Margo just doesn't miss
      performances. If she can walk,
      crawl or roll - she plays. 

               EVE
          (nods proudly)
      The show must go on. 

               KAREN
      No, dear. Margo must go on. 
          (she sits beside Eve)
      As a matter of fact, I see no
      reason why you shouldn't be Margo's
      understudy...

               EVE
      Do you think Miss Channing would
      approve?

               KAREN
      I think she would cheer. 

               EVE
      But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-

               KAREN
      They'll do as they're told.

Eve smiles a little. A pause. 

               EVE
      Then - would you talk to Mr. Fabian
      about it? 

               KAREN
      Of course. 

               EVE
      You won't forget it?

               KAREN
      I won't forget. 

               EVE
      I seem to be forever thanking you
      for something, don't I?

She hugs Karen, leaves. She nearly collides with Birdie on
her way in. 

               BIRDIE
      The bed looks like a dead animal
      act. Which one is sables?

               KAREN
          (pointing)
      But she just got here...

               BIRDIE
      She's on her way. With half the men
      in the joint. 
          (she hold up the coat)
      It's only a fur coat...

               KAREN
      What did you expect - live sables?

               BIRDIE
      A diamond collar, gold sleeves -
      you know, picture people...

They start out. 

               KAREN
      Bill says actors out there eat just
      as infrequently as here-

               BIRDIE
      They can always grab oranges off
      trees. This you can't do in Times
      Square...

Through the open door, we see them go down the stairs and out
of sight. 

INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING AND STAIRS - NIGHT

Karen and Birdie come down the stairs to Bill, Max, Addison,
a blonde young lady named MISS CASWELL (Addison's protegee-of
the-moment) - and, at the feet of Bill and Addison... Eve.
They are all seated on the steps.

Birdie goes through and down the stairs to the first floor.
Karen remains with the others. 

Addison is holding forth:

               ADDISON 
      Every now and then, some elder
      statesman of the Theater or cinema
      assures the public that actors and
      actresses are just plain folk.
      Ignoring the fact that their
      greatest attraction to the public
      is their complete lack of
      resemblance to normal human beings.

               MISS CASWELL
          (as Birdie and the sables
           pass)
      Now there's something a girl could
      make sacrifices for. 

               BILL'S VOICE
      And probably has. 

               MISS CASWELL
      Sable. 

               MAX
          (to Miss Caswell)
      Did you say sable - or Gable?

               MISS CASWELL
      Either one. 

               ADDISON
      It is senseless to insist that
      theatrical folk in New York,
      Hollywood and London are no
      different from the good people of
      Des Moines, Chillicothe and
      Liverpool. By and large, we are
      concentrated gatherings of
      neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional
      misfits, and precocious children-

               MAX
          (to Bill)
      Gable. Why a feller like that don't
      come East to do a play...

               BILL 
          (nods)
      He must be miserable, the life he
      lives out there-

               ADDISON
      These so-called abnormalities -
      they're our stock in trade, they
      make us actors, writers, directors,
      et cetera in the first place-

               MAX
      Answer me this. What makes a man
      become a producer?

               ADDISON 
      What makes a man walk into a lion
      cage with nothing but a chair?

               MAX
      This answer satisfies me a hundred
      percent. 

               ADDISON 
      We all have abnormality in common.
      We are a breed apart from the rest
      of the humanity, we Theater folk.
      We are the original displaced
      personalities...

               BILL 
          (laughs; to Eve)
      You don't have to read his column
      tomorrow - you just heard it. I
      don't agree, Addison...

               ADDISON
      That happens to be your particular
      abnormality. 

               BILL 
      Oh, I admit there's a screwball
      element in the Theater. It sticks
      out, it's got spotlights on it and
      a brass band. But it isn't basic,
      it isn't standard - if it were, the
      Theater couldn't survive...

               MISS CASWELL
          (to a passing butler)
      Oh, waiter...

The butler goes right by.

               ADDISON
      That isn't a waiter, my dear.
      That's a butler. 

               MISS CASWELL
      Well, I can't yell "Oh, butler,"
      can I? Maybe somebody's name is
      Butler...

               ADDISON 
      You have a point. An idiotic one,
      but a point. 

               MISS CASWELL
      I don't want to make trouble. All I
      want is a drink. 

               MAX
          (getting up)
      Leave me get you one...

               MISS CASWELL
          (pitching)
      Oh, thank you, Mr. Fabian.

Max leaves with her empty glass. 

               ADDISON
      Well done. I see your career rising
      in the East like the sun...
          (to Bill)
      ... you were saying?

               BILL 
      I was saying that the Theater is
      nine-tenths hard work. Work done
      the hard way - by sweat,
      application and craftsmanship. I'll
      agree to this - that to be a good
      actor, actress, or anything else in
      the Theater, means wanting to be
      that more than anything else in the
      world...

               EVE
          (abruptly)
      Yes. Yes, it does. 

               BILL
          (goes on)
      It means concentration of ambition,
      desire, and sacrifice such as no
      other profession demands... And
      I'll agree that the man or woman
      who accepts those terms can't be
      ordinary, can't be - just someone.
      To give so much for almost always
      so little...

Eve speaks almost unaware of what she says. She looks at no
one in particular, just off...

               EVE
      So little. So little, did you say?
      Why, if there's nothing else -
      there's applause. It's like - like
      waves of love coming over the
      footlights and wrapping you up.
      Imagine...
      To know, every night, that
      different hundreds of people love
      you... they smile, their eyes shine
      - you've pleased them, they want
      you, you belong. Just that alone is
      worth anything...

She becomes aware of Addison's strange smile, of Bill's looks
of warm interest. She's embarrassed, she turns away - then
scrambles to her feet as Margo approaches with Lloyd from the
direction of the pantry. 

Margo's had too much to drink. Her fake smile fades as Eve
gets up. She's unpleasant and depressed. 

               MARGO
      Don't get up. And please stop
      acting as if I were the queen
      mother. 

               EVE
          (hurt)
      I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-

               BILL
          (sharply)
      Outside of a beehive, Margo, your
      behavior would hardly be considered
      either queenly or motherly!

               MARGO
      You're in a beehive, pal, didn't
      you know? We're all busy little
      bees, full of stings, making honey
      day and night-
          (to Eve)
      - aren't we, honey?

               KAREN
      Margo, really...

               MARGO
      Please don't play governess, Karen,
      I haven't your unyielding good
      taste, I wish I'd gone to Radcliffe
      too but father wouldn't hear of it -
      he needed help at the notions
      counter...
          (to Addison)
      I'm being rude now, aren't I? OR
      should I say "ain't I"?

               ADDISON
      You're maudlin and full of self
      pity. You're magnificent. 

Max has come up with Miss Caswell's drink. 

               LLOYD
      How about calling it a night?

               MARGO
      And you pose as a playwright. A
      situation pregnant with
      possibilities - and all you can
      think of is everybody to go to
      sleep...

               BILL
      It's a good thought. 

               MARGO
      It won't play. 

               KAREN
      As a nonprofessional, I think it's
      an excellent idea. Undramatic, but
      practical...

As she speaks, she makes her way to Lloyd's side. 

               MARGO
      Happy little housewife...

               BILL
      Cut it out.

               MARGO
      This is my house, not a theater! In
      my house you're a guest, not a
      director-!

               KAREN
      Then stop being a star - start
      treating your guests as your
      supporting cast!

               ADDISON
      Hear, hear...

               LLOYD
      Now let's not get into a big hassle-

               KAREN 
      It's about time we did! It's about
      time Margo realized that what's
      attractive on stage need not
      necessarily be attractive off.

               MARGO
          (suddenly)
      All right! I'm going to bed.
          (to Bill)
      You be the host. It's your party.
      Happy Birthday, welcome home, and
      we-who-are-about-to-die-salute-you.

She starts upstairs.

               BILL
      Need any help?

               MARGO
          (pauses, smiles)
      To put me to bed? Take my clothes
      off, hold my head, tuck me in, turn
      off the lights, tiptoe out...? eve
      would. Wouldn't you, Eve?

               EVE
      If you'd like. 

               MARGO
      I wouldn't like. 

She goes up, exits out of sight. A pause. Miss Caswell
reaches up to take the drink out of Max's hand. 

               MAX
      I forgot I had it. 

               MISS CASWELL
      I didn't. 

Bill gets up and goes after Margo...

               ADDISON
      Too bad! We'll miss the third act.
      They're going to play it off stage. 

Eve turns away abruptly, in sudden tears. 

               LLOYD
      Coming?

               KAREN 
      In a minute...

She crosses to Eve, puts an arm around her. 

               KAREN 
      You mustn't mind Margo too much,
      even if I do...

               EVE
      But there must be some reason,
      something I've done without
      knowing...

               KAREN 
      The reason is Margo and don't try
      to figure it out. Einstein
      couldn't. 

               EVE
      If I thought I'd offended her, of
      all people-

               KAREN 
      Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I
      know Margo. And every now and then
      there is nothing I want to do so
      much as to kick her right square in
      the pants.

               EVE
          (smiles)
      Well - if she's got to pick on
      someone, I'd just as soon it was
      me.

Karen smiles back. She joins Lloyd and Max. 

               LLOYD
      Max is going to drop us...

               ADDISON 
      I've often wondered, Max, why you
      bother with a chauffeur and
      limousine in New York City.

               MAX
      In my case it's necessary. Too many
      taxi drivers write plays. 

               ADDISON 
      And too many of them are produced. 

               MISS CASWELL
      Let's go sit by the piano. 

               ADDISON
      You have me confused with Dan
      Dailey. You go sit by the piano.
          (to Eve)
      And you come sit by me.
          (to the others)
      Good night. 

They laugh, say "good night," and start downstairs. As Eve
crosses to Addison:

               EVE
      Karen...
          (Karen pauses)
      ... you won't forget, will you?
      What we talked about before?

               KAREN
          (smiles)
      No, Eve, I won't forget...

She follows the men downstairs. CLOSE UP of an old engraving
of Mrs. Siddons as 'The Tragic Muse' which hangs among other
theatrical mementos on the stair wall...

INT. DINING HALL - SARAH SIDDONS SOCIETY - NIGHT

The applause continues. Margo sits back in her chair now,
picking at a bit of fingernail polish...

               MARGO'S VOICE
      Bill's welcoming-home-birthday
      party... a night to go down in
      history. Like the Chicago Fire - or
      the Massacre of the Huguenots. Even
      before the party started, I could
      smell disaster in the air...

INT. MARGO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The same night as the previous sequence, but before the party
has started. Margo is all dressed except for jewelry. She
stands before her dressing table putting it on. She sips at
an enormous Martini...

               MARGO'S VOICE
      I knew it, I sensed it even as I
      finished dressing for that blasted
      party...

Birdie comes in. 

               BIRDIE
      You all put together? 

               MARGO
      My back's open.
          (Birdie goes to work on
           it)
      Did the extra help get here?

               BIRDIE
      There's some loose characters
      dressed like maids and butlers.
      Who'd you call - the William Morris
      Agency?

               MARGO
      You're not being funny, I could get
      actors for less. What about the
      food? 

               BIRDIE
      The caterer had to back for hors
      d'oeuvres-
          (she zips Margo)
      Voila. 

               MARGO
          (laughs)
      That French ventriloquist taught
      you a lot, didn't he?

               BIRDIE
      There was nothing he didn't know.
          (she starts tidying the
           room)
      There's a message from the
      bartender. Does Miss Channing know
      we ordered domestic gin by mistake?

               MARGO
      The only thing I ordered by mistake
      is the guests.
          (Birdie cackles)
      They're domestic, too, and they
      don't care what they drink as long
      as it burns... where's Bill? He's
      late. 

               BIRDIE
      Late for what?

               MARGO
      Don't be dense. The party. 

               BIRDIE
      I ain't dense. And he's been here
      twenty minutes. 

               MARGO
      Well, I certainly think it's odd he
      hasn't even come up...

Her glance meets Birdie's. She turns and strolls out. 

INT. THIRD FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT

Margo speeds up going down the stairs. 

INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT

Margo shows up again deliberately as she reaches the landing.
Sound of Bill and Eve laughing together from the living room.
Margo strolls toward it casually. 

We see Eve seated, looking up fascinated at Bill as he talks -
out of the laughter...

               BILL 
      "Don't let it worry you," said the
      cameraman, "Even DeMille couldn't
      see anything looking through the
      wrong end-"
          (Eve chuckles)
      So that was the first and last time-

Eve sees Margo approach. She gets up. Bill turns. 

INT. MARGO'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

As Margo strolls up, very off-hand.

               MARGO
      Don't let me kill the point. Or
      isn't it a story for grownups?

               BILL 
      You've heard it. About when I
      looked through the wrong end of a
      camera finder. 

               MARGO
          (to Eve)
      Remind me to tell you about when I
      looked into the heart of an
      artichoke. 

               EVE
      I'd like to hear it. 

               MARGO
      Some snowy night in front of the
      fire... in the meantime, while
      we're on the subject, will you
      check about the hors d'oeuvres? The
      caterer forgot them, the varnish
      wasn't dry or something...

               EVE
      Of course.

She leaves. A short lull. Margo looks into cigarette boxes.
Bill eyes her curiosity, crosses to the fire. 

               BILL 
      Looks like I'm going to have a very
      fancy party...

               MARGO
      I thought you were going to be late-

               BILL 
      When I'm guest of honor?

               MARGO 
      I had no idea you were even here. 

               BILL 
      I ran into Eve on my way upstairs;
      she told me you were dressing. 

               MARGO
      That never stopped you before. 

               BILL 
      Well, we started talking, she
      wanted to know all about Hollywood,
      she seemed so interested...

               MARGO
      She's a girl of so many interests. 

               BILL 
      It's a pretty rare quality these
      days. 

               MARGO
      She's a girl of so many rare
      qualities. 

               BILL 
      So she seems. 

               MARGO
          (the steel begins to
           flash)
      So you've pointed out, so often. So
      many qualities, so often. Her
      loyalty, efficiency, devotion,
      warmth, affection - and so young.
      So young and so fair...

Bill catches the drift. Incredulously. 

               BILL 
      I can't believe you're making this
      up - it sounds like something out
      of an old Clyde Fitch play...

               MARGO
      Clyde Fitch, thought you may not
      think so, was well before my time!

               BILL 
          (laughs)
      I've always denied the legend that
      you were in 'Our American Cousin'
      the night Lincoln was shot...

               MARGO
      I don't think that's funny!

               BILL 
      Of course it's funny - this is all
      too laughable to be anything else.
      You know what I think about this -
      this age obsession of yours - and
      now this ridiculous attempt to whip
      yourself up into a jealous froth
      because I spent ten minutes with a
      stage-struck kid-

               MARGO
      Twenty minutes!

               BILL 
      Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What
      of it?

               MARGO
      Stage-struck kid... she's a young
      lady - of qualities. And I'll have
      you know I'm fed up with both the
      young lady and her qualities!
      Studying me as if - as if I were a
      play or a set of blueprints! How I
      walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!

               BILL 
      Now how can you take offense at a
      kid trying in every way to be as
      much like her ideal as possible! 

               MARGO
      Stop calling her a kid! It so
      happens there are particular
      aspects of my life to which I would
      like to maintain sole and exclusive
      rights and privileges!

               BILL 
      For instance what?

               MARGO
      For instance - you!

               BILL 
      This is my cue to take you in my
      arms and reassure you - but I'm not
      going to. I'm too mad-

               MARGO
      - guilty.

               BILL 
      Mad! Darling, there are certain
      characteristics for which you are
      famous - on stage and off. I love
      you for some of them - and in spite
      of others. I haven't let those
      become too important to me. They're
      part of your equipment for getting
      along in what is laughably called
      out environment - you've got to
      keep your teeth sharp. All right.
      But you will not sharpen them on me
      - or on Eve...

               MARGO
      What about her teeth? What about
      her fangs? 

               BILL 
      She hasn't cut them yet, and you
      know it! So when you start judging
      an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by
      the barroom, Benzedrine standards
      of this megalomaniac society - I
      won't have it! Eve Harrington has
      never by word, look, thought or
      suggestion indicated anything to me
      but her adoration for you and her
      happiness at our being in love! And
      to intimate anything else doesn't
      spell jealousy to me - it spells a
      paranoic insecurity that you should
      be ashamed of!

               MARGO
      Cut! Print it! What happens in the
      next reel? Do I get dragged off
      screaming to the snake pit? 

               EVE'S VOICE
          (quietly)
      Miss Channing?

Bill and Margo look off. Eve is in the room. They have no way
of knowing how long she's been there. 

               EVE
      The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is
      there anything else I can do? 

               MARGO
      Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini -
      very dry. 

               BILL 
      I'll get it.
          (he crosses to Eve)
      What'll you have? 

Eve, involuntarily, looks to Margo.

               MARGO
      A milkshake?

Eve smiles, turns to Bill. 

               EVE
      A Martini. Very dry, please...

Bill smiles back and starts across the landing toward the
pantry. As he crosses the stairs, Karen, Lloyd and Max come
up from the street level below. General greetings. Bill
continues up to pantry. Eve and then Margo come up to add
their welcome...

               EVE
          (to Karen)
      May I have your coat?

               KAREN
      Don't bother, I can take it up
      myself...

               EVE
      Please...

Karen yields with a "thank you, Eve-." Eve goes up with the
coat. Lloyd looks after her approvingly.

               LLOYD
      I like that girl. That quality of
      quiet graciousness...

               MARGO
      ... Among so many quiet qualities.

They start for the living room.

               KAREN 
      Margo, nothing you've ever done has
      made me as happy as your taking Eve
      in...

               MARGO
      I'm so happy you're happy. 

               MAX
      Look, you haven't been running a
      settlement house exactly - the
      kid's earned her way. You had a
      pretty mixed-up inventory when she
      took over - merchandise laying all
      over the shop...

               LLOYD
      You've got Margo mixed up with a
      five-and-ten-cent store...

               MARGO
      Make it Bergdorf Goodman... and now
      everything is on its proper shelf,
      eh, Max? Done up in little ribbons.
      I could die right now and nobody'd
      be confused. How about you, Max?

               MAX
      How about me what? 

They've come to a halt near the fireplace. 

               MARGO
      Supposed you dropped dead. What
      about your inventory?

               MAX
      I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit. 

               KAREN 
      This is the most ghoulish
      conversation...

Bill brings two Martinis. He hands one to Margo. 

               MARGO
          (it drips ice)
      Thank you. 

               BILL 
      Nothing, really...

               MARGO
      The kid - junior, that is - will be
      right down. Unless you'd like to
      take her drink up to her...

               BILL 
          (smiles)
      I can always get a fresh one. Karen
      - you're a Gibson girl...

He hands Eve's drink to Karen. Max has wandered off. Other
guests are arriving. Margo gulps her drink, hands Bill the
empty glass. He puts it on a passing tray. Margo takes a
fresh one at the same time. 

               LLOYD
      The general atmosphere is very
      Macbethish. What has or is about to
      happen? 

               MARGO
          (to Bill)
      What is he talking about? 

               BILL 
      Macbeth. 

               KAREN 
          (to Margo)
      We know you, we've seen you before
      like this. Is it over - or just
      beginning? 

Margo surveys them all. 

               MARGO
      Fasten your seat belts. It's going
      to be a bumpy night. 

She downs the drink, hands the empty glass to Bill, and
leaves them. She passes two women, gabbing by the piano. As
they see her:

               WOMAN #1
      Margo, darling!

               WOMAN #2
      Darling!

               MARGO
          (passing)
      Darlings...

She arrives at the landing just as Addison comes up with Miss
Caswell. Margo takes a drink from a passing tray. 

               MARGO
          (to Addison)
      I distinctly remember striking your
      name from the guest list. What are
      you doing here?

               ADDISON
      Dear Margo. You were an
      unforgettable Peter Pan - you must
      play it again, soon. You remember
      Miss Caswell?

               MARGO
      I do not. How do you do?

               MISS CASWELL
      We never met. That's why. 

               ADDISON
      Miss Caswell is an actress. A
      graduate of Copacabana School of
      Dramatic Arts. 
          (his glance is attracted
           by Eve coming downstairs)
      Ah... Eve.

               EVE
          (deferentially)
      Good evening, Mr. deWitt.

               MARGO
      I had no idea you knew each other.

               ADDISON 
      This must be, at long last, our
      formal introduction. Until now we
      have met only in passing...

               MISS CASWELL
      That's how you met me. In passing. 

               MARGO
          (smiles)
      Eve, this is an old friend of Mr.
      deWitt's mother - Miss Caswell,
      Miss Harrington...
          (the two girls say hello)
      Addison, I've been wanting you to
      meet Eve for the longest time-

               ADDISON
          (murmurs)
      It could only have been your
      natural timidity that kept you from
      mentioning it...

               MARGO
      You've heard of her great interest
      in the Theater-

               ADDISON
      We have that in common. 

               MARGO
      Then you two must have a long talk-

               EVE
      I'm afraid Mr. deWitt would find me
      boring before too long. 

               MISS CASWELL
      You won't bore him, honey. You
      won't even get to talk. 

               ADDISON
          (icily)
      Claudia dear, come closer.
          (she does, and he points)
      This is Max Fabian. He is a
      producer. Go do yourself some good. 

               MISS CASWELL
          (sighs)
      Why do they always look like
      unhappy rabbits? 

               ADDISON
      Because that is what they are. Go
      make him happy. 

Miss Caswell drapes her coat over the rail, heads for Max.
Addison puts Eve's arm in his. 

               ADDISON
          (to Margo)
      You mustn't worry about your little
      charge. She is in safe hands. 

               MARGO
      Amen.

Eve smiles uncertainly at Margo as he leads her away. Margo
looks after them. She downs her drink...

INT. MARGO'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

It's many Martinis later. Most of the guests have gone. The
party has reached that static state - everyone's assumed more
or less permanent places. 

Birdie passes, carrying a cup of coffee. CAMERA FOLLOWS her
to the piano where Margo sits on the bench beside the
pianist. He is just finishing "Liebestraum" and she stares
moodily into a Martini. Birdie halts beside her with the
coffee. Margo looks up. Birdie holds out the coffee. Margo
takes the onion out of the Martini, drops it into the coffee
and waves Birdie away. Birdie goes. "Liebestraum" comes to an
end. The pianist tries to ease into a more sophisticated
rhythm. Margo stops him. 

               MARGO
          (quietly)
      "Liebestraum."

               PIANIST
      I just played it. 

               MARGO
      Play it again. 

               PIANIST
      But that was the fourth straight
      time. 

               MARGO
      Then this will be five. I suppose
      you think I'm too drunk to count. 

               PIANIST
      No. You're just crazy about
      "Liebestraum."

               MARGO
      "Liebestraum."

               PIANIST
      Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of
      depressing. If you don't mind my
      saying so, everybody's kind of
      dying on the vine...

               MARGO
      My dear Horowitz. In the first
      place, I'm paying you union scale.
      Second, it's my piano. Third, if
      everybody doesn't like kind of
      dying on the vine, they can get off
      the vine and go home.
      "Liebestraum."

Unhappily, he plays "Liebestraum." Margo sips her Martini,
stares down into it again. Bill tiptoes up. 

               BILL
          (whispers)
      Many of your guests have been
      wondering when they may be
      permitted to view the body. Where
      has it been laid out? 

               MARGO
          (somberly)
      It hasn't been laid out, we haven't
      finished with the embalming. As a
      matter of fact, you're looking at
      it. The remains of Margo Channing.
      Sitting up. It is my last wish to
      be buried sitting up. 

               BILL 
          (trying to kid her out of
           it)
      Wouldn't you feel more natural
      taking a bow?

               MARGO
      You know nothing about feelings,
      natural or unnatural. 

               BILL 
      Then without feeling, your guests
      were also wondering whether the
      music couldn't be a shade more on
      the - shall we say, happier side?

               MARGO
      If my guests do not like it here, I
      suggest they accompany you to the
      nursery where I'm sure you will all
      feel more at home. 

Bill is about to get mad - when Max bustles up. 

               MAX
      Margo. You by any chance got
      bicarbonate of soda in the house?

               MARGO
          (sympathetic)
      Poor Max. Heartburn?
          (Max nods)
      It's that Miss Caswell. I don't
      know why she doesn't give Addison
      heartburn. 

               BILL 
      No heart to burn. 

               MARGO
      Everybody has a heart - except some
      people.
          (she finishes her drink,
           stands up)
      Of course I've got bicarb. There's
      a box in the pantry. We'll put your
      name on it. Max Fabian. It'll say
      there. Always. Just for you. 

               MAX
          (touched)
      Let the rest of the world beat
      their brains out for a buck. It's
      friends that count. And I got
      friends. 

               MARGO
      I love you, Max. I really mean it.
      I love you. Come to the pantry. 

She takes off. Max waits to set Bill straight. 

               MAX
      She loves me like a father. Also,
      she's loaded. 

He starts off after Margo. As the CAMERA PANS with Bill we
see Margo going into the pantry with Max following her. Bill
joins Addison and Miss Caswell on the stairs. 

INT. PANTRY - NIGHT

It's a good sized one. In the b.g., the caterers are packing
dishes, glassware, etc. Margo crosses to a cupboard. She
finds the bicarb. 

               MARGO
      Here you are, Maxie dear. One good
      burp and you'll be rid of that Miss
      Caswell...

               MAX
      The situation I'm in ain't the kind
      you can belch your way out. I made
      a promise...

               MARGO
      Miss Caswell?
          (Max nods)
      What?

               MAX
      An audition for the part we're
      replacing. What's-her-name, your
      sister...

He adds water to the bicarb. 

               MARGO
      Well, if she can act, she might not
      be bad. She looks like she might
      burn down a plantation...

               MAX
          (mixing)
      I feel right now like there's one
      burning in me. 

               MARGO
      When's the audition?

               MAX
      A couple of weeks. 

               MARGO
      I tell you what. Why don't I read
      with her? 

               MAX
      Would you?

               MARGO
      Anything to help you out, Max. 

               MAX
      This is real cooperation. I
      appreciate it. 

               MARGO
      Not at all. And you could do me a
      big favor, if you would-

               MAX
      All you got to do is name it. 

               MARGO
      Give Eve Harrington job in you
      office.

Max burps. 

               MARGO
      You get quick action, don't you?

               MAX
      Margo, I wouldn't think of taking
      that girl away from you...

               MARGO
      You said yourself my inventory was
      in good shape - all of my
      merchandise put away. To keep her
      here with nothing to do - I'd be
      standing in her way... and you need
      her, Max. 

               MAX
      But what could she do?

               MARGO
      She'd be a great help - read
      scripts, interview people you have
      to see, get rid of the ones you
      don't have to... you'd be a man of
      leisure-

               MAX
      Well...

               MARGO 
      Think of your health, Max - more
      time to relax out in the fresh air
      at a race track...

               MAX
      I don't know if this would be a
      wise move...

               MARGO
      Promise. 

               MAX
      I promise. 

               MARGO
          (happily)
      That's my Max. 

Lloyd enters, looking for her. 

               LLOYD
      There you are, both of you. Max,
      Karen has decided it's time to go.

               MARGO
      Where is she?

               LLOYD
      Up in the room. 

               MAX
      If you'll excuse me-
          (to Margo)
      I'll tell Miss Caswell...

He goes out. A pause. 

               MARGO
      Who's left out there?

               LLOYD
      Too many. And you've got a new
      guest. A movie star from Hollywood. 

               MARGO
      Shucks. And my autograph book is at
      the cleaners.

Another pause. 

               MARGO
      You disapprove of me when I'm like
      this, don't you?

               LLOYD
      Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I
      wish I understood you better.

               MARGO
      When you do, let me in on it. 

               LLOYD
      I will. 

Another pause. 

               MARGO
      How's the new one coming?

               LLOYD
      The play? All right, I guess...

               MARGO
      "Cora." She's - still a girl of
      twenty?

               LLOYD
      Twentyish. It isn't important. 

               MARGO
      Don't you think it's about time it
      became important?

               LLOYD
      How do you mean? 

               MARGO
      Don't be evasive. 

               LLOYD
      Margo, you haven't got any age. 

               MARGO
      Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken
      like a press agent.

               LLOYD
      I know what I'm talking about,
      after all they're my plays...

               MARGO
      Spoken like an author.
          (abruptly)
      Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not
      thirtyish. Three months ago, I was
      forty years old. Forty. Four oh.
          (smiles)
      That slipped out, I hadn't quite
      made up my mind to admit it. Now I
      feel as if I'd suddenly taken all
      my clothes off...

               LLOYD
      Week after week, to thousands of
      people, you're as young as you
      want...

               MARGO
      ... as young as they want, you
      mean. And I'm not interested in
      whether thousands of people think
      I'm six or six hundred-

               LLOYD
      Just one person. Isn't that so?
          (Margo doesn't answer)
      You know what this is all about,
      don't you? It has very little to do
      with whether you should play "Cora"
      - it has everything to do with the
      fact that you've had another fight
      with Bill. 

A pause. Margo closes the box of bicarb. 

               MARGO
      Bill's thirty-two. He looks thirty
      two. He looked it five years ago,
      he'll look it twenty years from
      now. I hate men. 
          (she puts the box down)
      Don't worry, Lloyd. I'll play your
      play. I'll wear rompers and come in
      rolling a hoop if you like... let's
      go say good night. 

They exit into the dining room. As they open the swinging
door, the CAMERA REMAINS in the doorway. Margo and Lloyd walk
toward the stairs. In the b.g., Eve is talking to the group.
How much she says is dependent on how long it takes Margo and
Lloyd to reach her. 

               EVE
          (in the b.g.)
      Imagine... to know, every night,
      that different hundreds of people
      love you... They smile, their eyes
      shine - you've pleased them, they
      want you, you belong. Anything's
      worth that. 

Just as before, she becomes aware of Margo's approach with
Lloyd. She scrambles to her feet...

               MARGO
      Don't get up. And please stop
      acting as if I were the queen
      mother. 

And as Margo speaks - or before - we 

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. N.Y. THEATER STREET - DAY

Margo gets out of a cab in front of the theater and goes in.
It's Friday afternoon - no performance. 

               MARGO'S VOICE
      What was it the wise man said -
      "This, too, will pass away"? Two
      weeks later - the day of the
      audition - all was well with Bill
      and me, the world and me-

INT. LOBBY AND FOYER - CURRAN THEATER - DAY

Margo comes from the street through the lobby ( a few people
buying tickets) and into the deserted foyer. She spots
Addison sprawled on one of the sofas. 

               MARGO
      Why so remote, Addison? I should
      think you'd be at the side of your
      protegee, lending her moral
      support...

               ADDISON
      Miss Caswell, at the moment, is
      where I can lend no support - moral
      or otherwise.

               MARGO
      The ladies' - shall we say -
      lounge?

               ADDISON
      Being violently ill to her tummy. 

               MARGO
      It's good luck before an audition.
      She'll be all right once it starts.

She heads for the auditorium.

               ADDISON
      Miss Caswell got lucky too late.
      The audition is over. 

               MARGO
          (stops)
      Over? It can't be. I've come to
      read with her. I promised Max. 

               ADDISON
      The audition was called for 2:30.
      It is now nearly four. 

               MARGO
          (lightly)
      Is it really? I must start wearing
      a watch, I never do, you know...
      who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?
          (he shakes his head)
      Lloyd?
          (he shakes his head)
      Well, it couldn't have been Max!
      Who?

               ADDISON
      Naturally enough, your understudy. 

               MARGO
      I consider it highly unnatural to
      allow a girl in an advanced state
      of pregnancy-

               ADDISON
      I refer to your new and unpregnant
      understudy. Eve Harrington. 

               MARGO
      Eve! My understudy...

               ADDISON
          (keenly)
      Didn't you know?

               MARGO
          (quickly)
      Of course I knew. 

               ADDISON
      It just slipped your mind. 

A moment of silence. 

               MARGO
      How... how was Miss Caswell?

               ADDISON
      Frankly, I don't remember.

               MARGO
      Just slipped your mind. 

               ADDISON
      Completely. Nor, I am sure, could
      anyone else present tell you how
      Miss Caswell read or whether Miss
      Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.

               MARGO
      Was she that bad?

As Addison speaks, he rises with excitement.

               ADDISON
      Margo, as you know, i have lived in
      the Theater as a Trappist monk
      lives in his faith. I have no other
      world, no other life - and once in
      a great while I experience that
      moment of Revelation for which all
      true believers wait and pray. You
      were one. Jeanne Eagels another...
      Paula Wessely... Hayes - there are
      others, three or four. Eve
      Harrington will be among them...

               MARGO
          (flatly)
      I take it she read well.

               ADDISON
      It wasn't reading, it was a
      performance. Brilliant, vivid,
      something made of music and fire...

               MARGO
      How nice. 

               ADDISON
      In time she'll be what you are. 

               MARGO
      A mass of music and fire. That's
      me. An old kazoo and some sparkles.
      Tell me - was Bill swept away, too,
      or were you too full of Revelation
      to notice?

               ADDISON
      Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was
      beside himself. He listened to his
      play as if someone else had written
      it, he said, it sounded so fresh,
      so new, so full of meaning...

               MARGO
      How nice for Lloyd. And how nice
      for Eve. How nice for everybody.

Addison, of course, knows exactly what she's doing. He senses
the approaching typhoon, he whips it up...

               ADDISON
      Eve was incredibly modest. She
      insisted that no credit was due
      her, that Lloyd felt as he did only
      because she read lines exactly as
      he had written them. 

               MARGO
      The implication being that I have
      not been reading them as written.

               ADDISON
      To the best of my recollection,
      neither your name nor your
      performance entered the
      conversation. 

Miss Caswell appears, uncertain, in the b.g.

               ADDISON 
      Feeling better, my dear?

               MISS CASWELL
      Like I just swam the English
      Channel. Now what?

               ADDISON
      You next move, it seems to me,
      should be toward television. 

Margo, abruptly, starts for the auditorium. Addison smiles.
He takes Miss Caswell's arm. 

               MISS CASWELL
      Tell me this. Do they have
      auditions for television?

               ADDISON
      That's all television is, my dear.
      Nothing but auditions. 

He takes her toward the street. 

INT. THEATER - CURRAN THEATER - DAY

The curtain is up; the set, covered, is a bedroom in a
deteriorating Southern mansion. 

There is no one in the theater but Max, seated on the aisle
about two-thirds down, and Eve with Lloyd and Bill on the
stage. She is seated; they stand between her and auditorium.
There is some ad lib talk among the three which we cannot
make out. Margo marches down the aisle with a steady pace. 

She passes Max smiles a sickly, hopeful smile. She ignores
him as if he were a used paper cup. She disappears through
the door which leads backstage. 

Max whistles. Lloyd turns. Max indicated the door and puts
his hands to his head in despair. 

Margo walks out of the wings on stage. Bill and Lloyd turn to
her. Eve rises. 

               MARGO
          (cheerily)
      Terribly sorry I'm late, lunch was
      long and I couldn't find a cab -
      where's Miss Caswell, shall we
      start? Oh, hello, Eve...

               EVE
      Hello, Miss Channing. 

               MARGO
      How are you making out in Mr.
      Fabian's office?
          (over the footlights to
           Max)
      I don't want you working the child
      too hard, Max - just because you
      promised. As you see, I kept my
      promise, too...

Max slumps in his seat. By the time Margo turns back to them,
the others have exchanged swift looks. 

               BILL 
      It's all over. 

               MARGO
      What's all over?

               BILL 
      The audition. 

               MARGO
          (pleased astonishment)
      Eve?
          (she turns to her)
      How enchanting...
          (to Lloyd and Bill)
      Wherever did you get the idea of
      having Eve read with Miss Caswell?

               LLOYD
      She's your understudy.

               MARGO
      Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had
      no idea...

               LLOYD
      I thought you knew... She was put
      on over a week ago-

               MARGO
      It seems almost inconceivable that
      I haven't seen her backstage, but
      with so many people loitering
      around... well, well. So Eve is not
      working for Max after all-
          (out to Max again)
      - Max you sly puss.

Max submerges further in his seat. 

               EVE
      Miss Channing, I can't tell you how
      glad I am that you arrived so late.

               MARGO
      Really, Eve? Why?

               EVE
      Well, if you'd been here to begin
      with, I wouldn't have dared to read
      at all...

               MARGO
      Why not?

               EVE
      ... and if you'd come in the
      middle, I'd have stopped, I
      couldn't have gone on-

               MARGO
          (murmurs)
      What a pity, all that fire and
      music being turned off...

               BILL 
      What fire and music?

               MARGO
      You wouldn't understand. 
          (to Lloyd)
      How was Miss Caswell?

               LLOYD
      Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo,
      let me tell you about Eve-

               EVE
          (breaking in)
      I was dreadful, Miss Channing,
      believe me - I have no right to be
      anyone's understudy, much less
      yours...

               MARGO
      I'm sure you underestimate
      yourself, Eve. You always do.
          (to Lloyd)
      You were about to tell me about
      Eve...

               LLOYD
      You'd have been proud of her.

               MARGO
      I'm sure. 

               LLOYD
      She was a revelation...

               MARGO
      To you, too?

               LLOYD
      What do you mean?

               MARGO
          (the ice begins to form)
      I mean, among other things, that it
      must have been a revelation to have
      your twenty-four-year-old character
      played by twenty-four-year-old
      actress...

               LLOYD
      That's beside the point. 

               MARGO
      It's right to the point. Also that
      it must have sounded so new and
      fresh to you - so exciting to have
      the lines read as you wrote them!

               BILL 
      Addison-!

               MARGO
      So full of meaning, fire and music!

               LLOYD
      You've been talking to that
      venomous fishwife, Addison deWitt-

               MARGO
      - in this case, apparently, as
      trustworthy as the World Almanac!

               LLOYD
      You knew when you came in that the
      audition was over, that Eve was
      your understudy! Playing that
      childish game of cat and mouse...

               MARGO
      Not mouse, never mouse! If anything
      - rat!

               LLOYD
      You have a genius for making
      barroom brawl out of a perfectly
      innocent misunderstanding at most! 

               MARGO
      Perfectly innocent! Man have been
      hanged for less! I'm lied to,
      attacked behind my back, accused of
      reading your silly dialogue
      inaccurately - as if it were Holy
      Gospel!

               LLOYD
      I never said it was!

               MARGO
      Then you listened as if someone
      else had written you play - whom
      did you have in mind? Sherwood?
      Arthur Miller? Beaumont and
      Fletcher? 

Max has edged his way to the stage. 

               MAX
          (from below)
      May I say a word?

               LLOYD
      No!
          (to Margo)
      What makes you think that either
      Miller or Sherwood would stand for
      the nonsense I take from you -
      you'd better stick to Beaumont and
      Fletcher! They've been dead for
      three hundred years! 

He stalks into the wings. Bill's reaction to the fight is
typical. He lights a cigarette, stretches out on the covered
bed. Eve stands frozen with fear. Margo yells after Lloyd
into the wings. 

               MARGO
      And they're getting better
      performances today than they ever
      got! All playwrights should be dead
      for three hundred years!

Lloyd comes out of the door leading to the auditorium. The
battle goes on without a pause. As he yells back, he crosses
to Max at row A, center. 

               LLOYD
      That would solve none of their
      problems - because actresses never
      die! The stars never die and never
      change!

He starts up the aisle with Max. 

               MARGO
      You can change this star any time
      you want! For a new, fresh,
      exciting one fully equipped with
      fire and music! Any time you want -
      starting with tonight's
      performance!

Now it's Max who stops and shouts back at her.

               MAX
      This is for lawyers to talk about,
      this concerns a run-of-the-play
      contract, and this you can't
      rewrite or ad lib!

               MARGO
          (from the stage)
      Are you threatening me with legal
      action, Mr. Fabian?

               MAX
      Are you breaking the contract?

               MARGO
      Answer my question!

               MAX
      Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying
      man. 

               MARGO
      I didn't hear you. 

               MAX 
          (yelling)
      I said I'm a dying man!

               MARGO
      Not until the last drugstore has
      sold its last pill!

               LLOYD
          (from the top of the
           aisle)
      I shall never understand the weird
      process by which a body with a
      voice suddenly fancies itself a
      mind! Just when exactly does an
      actress decide they're her words
      she's saying and her thoughts she's
      expressing? 

               MARGO
      Usually at the point when she's got
      to rewrite and rethink them to keep
      the audience from leaving the
      theater!

               LLOYD
      It's about time the piano realized
      it has not written the concerto!

Max has already walked out unhappily. Lloyd now slams out.
Margo glares after him, then turns to Bill who smokes his
cigarette peacefully on the bed. 

               MARGO
          (quiet menace)
      And you, I take it, are the
      Paderewski who plays his concerto
      on me, the piano? 
          (Bill waves his cigarette;
           he's noncommittal)
      Where is Princess Fire-and-Music?

               BILL 
      Who?

               MARGO
      The kid. Junior. 

               BILL 
          (looks lazily)
      Gone.

               MARGO
      I must have frightened her away. 

               BILL 
      I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes
      you frighten me. 

               MARGO
          (paces up and down)
      Poor little flower. Just dropped
      her petals and folded her tent...

               BILL 
      Don't mix your metaphors. 

               MARGO
      I mix what I like. 

               BILL 
      Okay. Mix. 

               MARGO
      I'm nothing but a body with a
      voice. No mind. 

               BILL
      What a body, what a voice. 

               MARGO
      The ex-ship news' reporter. No
      body, no voice, all mind!

               BILL 
      The gong rang. The fight's over.
      Calm down. 

               MARGO
      I will not calm down!

               BILL 
      Don't calm down. 

               MARGO
      You're being terribly tolerant,
      aren't you?

               BILL 
      I'm trying terribly hard. 

               MARGO
      Well, you needn't. I will not be
      tolerated. And I will not be
      plotted against!

               BILL 
      Here we go...

               MARGO
      Such nonsense, what do you all take
      me for - little Nell from the
      country? Been my understudy for
      over a week without my knowing,
      carefully hidden no doubt-

               BILL 
          (sits up)
      Now don't get carried away-

               MARGO
          (going right on)
      - shows up for an audition when
      everyone knew I'd be here... and
      gives a performance! Out of nowhere
      - gives a performance!

               BILL 
      You've been all through that with
      Lloyd-

               MARGO
      The playwright doesn't make the
      performance - and it doesn't just
      happen! And this one didn't - full
      of fire and music and whatnot, it
      was carefully rehearsed I have no
      doubt, over and over, full of those
      Bill Sampson touches!

               BILL 
      I am sick and tired of these
      paranoiac outbursts!

               MARGO
      Paranoiac!

               BILL 
      I didn't know Eve Harrington was
      your understudy until half past two
      this afternoon!

               MARGO
      Tell that to Dr. Freud! Along with
      the rest of it...

She turns away. Bill grabs her, pulls her down on the bed. He
holds her down. 

               BILL 
      No, I'll tell it to you! For the
      last time, I'll tell it to you.
      Because you've got to stop hurting
      yourself, and me, and the two of us
      by these paranoiac tantrums!

               MARGO
          (struggling)
      That word again! I don't even know
      what it means...

               BILL 
          (firmly)
      It's time you found out. I love
      you.
          (Margo says "Ha!")
      I love you. You're a beautiful and
      intelligent woman-          
          (Margo says "A body with a
           voice")
      - a beautiful and intelligent woman
      and a great actress-
          (he waits; Margo says
           nothing)
      - at the peak of her career. You
      have every reason for happiness-
          (Margo says "Except
           happiness")
      - every reason, but due to some
      strange, uncontrollable,
      unconscious drive you permit the
      slightest action of a kid-
          (Margo sneers "Kid!")
      - kid like Eve to turn you into a
      hysterical, screaming harpy! Now
      once and for all, stop it!  

Margo seems quiet. He gets up. She sits up. 

               MARGO
      It's obvious you're not a woman.

               BILL 
      I've been aware of that for some
      time. 

               MARGO
      Well, I am. 

               BILL 
      I'll say. 

               MARGO
      Don't be condescending. 

               BILL 
      Come on, get up. I'll buy you a
      drink. 

               MARGO
          (with dignity)
      I admit I may have seen better
      days, but I am still not to be had
      for the price of a cocktail - like
      a salted peanut.

               BILL 
          (laughs)
      Margo, let's make peace.

               MARGO
      The terms are too high.
      Unconditional surrender. 

               BILL 
      Just being happy? Just stopping all
      this nonsense about Eve - and Eve
      and me?

               MARGO
      It's not nonsense. 

               BILL 
      But if I tell you it is - as I just
      did. Were you listening to me? 
          (Margo nods)
      Isn't that enough?

               MARGO
      I wish it were. 

               BILL 
      Then what would be enough?
          (Margo doesn't answer)
      If we were married?

               MARGO
      I wouldn't want you to marry me
      just to prove something. 

               BILL 
      You've had so many reasons for not
      wanting to marry me... Margo, tell
      me what's behind all this.

               MARGO
      I - I don't know, Bill. Just a
      feeling, I don't know...

               BILL 
      I think you do know but you won't
      or can't tell me. 
          (Margo doesn't say)
      I said before it was going to be my
      last try, and I meant it. I can't
      think of anything else to do. I
      wish I could. 
          (a pause)
      We usually wind up screaming and
      throwing things as the curtain
      comes down. Then it comes up again
      and everything's fine. But not this
      time.
          (he takes a breath)
      You know there isn't a playwright
      in the world who could make me
      believe this would happen between
      two adult people. Goodbye, Margo. 

No word from her. He starts away. 

               MARGO
      Bill...
          (he stops)
      ... where are you going? To find
      Eve? 

               BILL 
          (smiles grimly)
      That suddenly makes the whole thing
      believable.

He goes out. Margo, alone, sit for a moment sadly. Then she
begins to cry...

INT. RICHARDS' STUDIO APARTMENT - DAY

One large room, a small foyer with a door to the corridor. A
stair up one wall to a narrow balcony from which a couple of
bedroom open.

Karen is painting. Earnestly but badly. A still life of an
orange, an avocado, an eggplant and three bananas. 

               KAREN'S VOICE
      On the day of the audition, my
      biggest worry was to keep a banana
      looking part of an eggplant... then
      Lloyd came home.
          (in the b.g., Lloyd lets
           himself in)
      It was right after his brawl with
      Margo...

Lloyd slams the door, flings his hat away, strides in,
peeling off muffler and overcoat. 

               KAREN
      Lloyd, what happened...?

               LLOYD
      Up to here! That's where I've got
      it - up to here! Of all the star
      ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-

               KAREN
      Margo, again...

               LLOYD
      And again and again! Two hours late
      for the audition, to begin with-

               KAREN
      That's on time for Margo. 

               LLOYD
      Then a childish, heavy-handed
      routine about not knowing Eve was
      her understudy-

               KAREN
      It's just possible she didn't...

               LLOYD
      Of course she knew! For one thing,
      Addison told her how superbly Eve
      had read the part-!
          (suddenly softening)
      Karen, let me tell you about Eve.
      She's got everything - a born
      actress. Sensitive, understanding,
      young, exciting, vibrant-

               KAREN
      - don't run out of adjectives,
      dear. 

               LLOYD
      - everything a playwright first
      thinks of wanting to write about...
      until his play becomes a vehicle
      for Miss Channing...

               KAREN
      Margo hasn't done badly by it.

               LLOYD
      Margo. Margo's great. She knows it.
      That's the trouble.
      She can play Peck's Bad Boy all she
      wants, and who's to stop her? Who's
      to give her that boot in the rear
      she needs and deserves? 

He starts up the stairs to the bedroom. 

               KAREN
          (murmurs)
      It's going to be a cozy weekend.

               LLOYD
          (pauses)
      What is?

               KAREN
      We're driving out to the country
      tomorrow night. Just the four of
      us. Bill, Margo, you and I...

               LLOYD
      Well. We've spent weekends before
      with nobody talking...
          (continues up stairs)
      ... just be sure to lock up all
      blunt instruments and throwable
      objects...

As he goes into one of the bedrooms, Karen sits thoughtfully
on a couch. She muses...

               KAREN'S VOICE
      Newton - they say, thought of
      gravity by getting hit on the head
      by an apple. And the man who
      invented the steam engine, he was
      watching a tea-kettle... but not
      me. My Big Idea came to me just
      sitting on a couch...

She lies down, folds her hands behind her head. 

               KAREN'S VOICE
      That boot in the rear to Margo.
      Heaven knows she had one coming.
      From me, from Lloyd, from Eve,
      Bill, Max, and so on - we'd all
      felt those size fives of hers often
      enough... but how? The answer was
      buzzing around me like a fly...

She sits up. She smiles. The smile fades...

               KAREN'S VOICE
      I had it. But I let it go.
      Screaming and calling names is one
      thing - but this could mean...

She shakes her head, crosses to her easel, resumes work on
the bananas. She slows down, then stops. 

               KAREN'S VOICE
      Why not? Why, I said to myself,
      not? It would all seem perfectly
      legitimate. And there were only two
      people in the world who would know.
      Also, the boot would land where it
      would do the most good for all
      concerned-

She puts the brush away and crosses to the phone which is by
Lloyd's work chair. As she crosses:

               KAREN'S VOICE
      And after all, it was not more than
      a perfectly harmless joke which
      Margo, herself, would be the first
      to enjoy...

She looks in a leather phone book, pick up the phone and
dials. 

               KAREN'S VOICE
      ... and no reason why she shouldn't
      be told about it - in time. 

There's an answer at the other end. 

               KAREN
          (into phone)
      Hello... will you call Miss Eve
      Harrington to the phone, please?
      Not at all... thank you.  

And as she waits we...

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

Open country. Preferably no houses in sight. Plenty of snow.
Lloyd's car drives along. 

               KAREN'S VOICE
      It was a cold weekend - outside and
      in. Bill didn't come at all.
      Margo didn't know where he was and
      didn't care - she kept saying.
      Somehow we staggered through Sunday
      - and by the time we drive Margo to
      the station late Monday afternoon,
      she and Lloyd had thawed out to the
      extent of being civil to each
      other...

INT. COUPE - NIGHT

Lloyd driving. All three in the front seat. 

               KAREN
      What time is it?

               LLOYD
      When you asked a minute ago it was
      five-forty-two. It is now five
      forty-three. When you ask a minute
      from no, it will be-

               KAREN
      I just don't want Margo to miss her
      train. As it is, she'll barely make
      the theater...

               LLOYD
      Five-fifty-five. We'll be at the
      station in plenty of time...

               MARGO
      That little place just two hours
      form New York. It's on my list of
      things-I'll-never-understand. Like
      collecting shrunken Indian heads...

               KAREN
      Of all people you should know what
      it means to want some peace and
      quiet-

               MARGO
      Peace and quit is for libraries. 

The car swerves - suddenly and slightly. 

               KAREN
      Lloyd, be careful...

               LLOYD
      Just a little skid, that's all.
      This road's like glass. 

               MARGO
      Karen and I just don't want an
      accident-

               LLOYD
      I have no intention of having an
      accident!

               MARGO
      It's not important whether you do.
      We are wearing long underwear. 

They all laugh. Suddenly the car slows and stops - with that
hissing sound that can mean only one thing - no gas. 

               LLOYD
      Now what's this...?

He tries to start it again. No luck. He turns on the
dashboard lights. The gas gauge reads empty. 

               LLOYD
      But it can't be! We can't be out of
      gas! I filled it myself yesterday!
          (to Karen)
      Wasn't it full when you drove to
      Brewster this morning?

               KAREN
          (very low)
      I guess I didn't look. You know I
      don't pay attention to those
      things...

               LLOYD
      Incredible. 

Futilely, he runs the started again. 

               MARGO
          (crisply)
      How much time have we? 

               KAREN
      Roughly ten minutes. 

               MARGO
      How far to the station?

               KAREN
      Three or four miles...

               MARGO
      Any houses or farms around where we
      can borrow gas?

               KAREN
          (looking)
      None in sight, there aren't many
      along this back road...

               MARGO
      Not many car either, not much
      chance of a lift...

A moment of silence. 

               LLOYD
      Well. No sense my just sitting
      here. I'm going to walk up about
      half a mile, just in case.

He starts out of the car. The cold comes in like a knife, the
women react. 

               KAREN
      You'll break your neck on that ice. 

               LLOYD
          (grins)
      What a way to die - trying to get
      an actress to the theater in time.
      Tell Max I want to be buried with
      royalties...

               KAREN
      Don't joke about such things.

               MARGO
          (quietly)
      How fortunate that I have an
      understudy so ready, so willing and
      so able to go on. 

               LLOYD
      The audience will want its money
      refunded, believe me. 

               MARGO
      Thank you, Lloyd. Godspeed. 

Lloyd starts down the road. He slips once, recovers, waves
and keeps going. 

               KAREN
      He always looks so pathetic
      whenever he does anything physical-

               MARGO
      It seems to me that walking, for
      most people, is not very dangerous. 

               KAREN
          (smiles)
      I just never think of Lloyd as
      anywhere but indoors and anything
      but sitting down. 

               MARGO
      Be brave. He'll come back - with or
      without gas. 

They tuck the fur car robe around them. A pause. Margo turns
on the radio... it's "Liebestraum."

               MARGO
      Do you want it on?

               KAREN
      It doesn't matter. 

               MARGO
      I detest cheap sentiment. 

She turns it off. Another pause. 

               MARGO
      Karen.
          (Karen says "hm?")
      I haven't been pleasant this
      weekend. 

               KAREN
      We've all seemed a little tense
      lately...

               MARGO
      Come to think of it, I haven't been
      very pleasant for weeks. For that,
      I'm truly sorry. More than any two
      people I know, I don't want you and
      Lloyd to be angry with me...

               KAREN
      We're never deeply angry, we just
      get sore. The way you do. We know
      you too well...

               MARGO
      So many people - know me. I wish I
      did. I wish someone would tell be
      about me...

               KAREN
      You're Margo. Just - Margo. 

               MARGO
      And what is that? Besides something
      spelled out in light bulbs, I mean.
      Besides something called
      temperament, which consists mostly
      of swooping about on a broomstick
      creaming at the top of my voice...
      infants behave the way I do, you
      know. They carry on and misbehave -
      they'd get drunk if they knew how -
      when they can't have what they
      want. When they feel unwanted and
      insecure - or unloved.   

There's a pause. 

               KAREN
      What about Bill?

               MARGO
      What about Bill?

               KAREN
      He's in love with you. 

               MARGO
      More than anything in this world, I
      love Bill. And I want Bill. I want
      him to want me. But me. Not Margo
      Channing. And if I can't tell they
      apart - how can he? 

               KAREN
      Why should he - and why should you? 

               MARGO
      Bill's in love with Margo Channing.
      He's fought with her, worked with
      her, loved her... but ten years
      from now - Margo Channing will have
      ceased to exist. And what's left
      will be... what?

               KAREN
      Margo. Bill is all of eight years
      younger than you. 

               MARGO
      Those years stretch as the years go
      on. I've seen it happen too often. 

               KAREN
      Not to you. Not to Bill.

               MARGO
      Isn't that what they always say? 

She turns the radio on again. A piano nocturne...

               MARGO
      I don't suppose the heater runs
      when the motor doesn't?

               KAREN
      Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd
      fix it so people could just sit in
      a car and keep warm...

Margo nods, get some cigarettes out of her bag. She offers
one to Karen. They light up. 

               MARGO
      About Eve. I've acted pretty
      disgracefully toward her, too. 

               KAREN
      Well...

               MARGO
      Let's not fumble for excuses, not
      here and now with my hair down. At
      best, let's say I've been
      oversensitive to... well, to the
      fact that she's so young - so
      feminine and helpless. To so many
      things I want to be for Bill...
      funny business, a woman's career.
      The things you drop on your way up
      the ladder, so you can move faster.
      You forget you'll need them again
      when you go back to being a woman.
      That's one career all females have
      in common - whether we like it or
      not - being a woman.
      Sooner or later we've all got to
      work at it, no matter what other
      careers we've had or wanted... and,
      in the last analysis, nothing is
      any good unless you can look up
      just before dinner or turns around
      in bed - and there he is. Without
      that, you're not woman. You're
      something with a French provincial
      office or a book full of clippings -
      but you're not a woman...     
          (she smiles at Karen)
      ... slow curtain. The end. 

A pause. There are tears in Karen's eyes. 

               KAREN
      Margo.
          (she hesitates)
      Margo, I want you to know how sorry
      I am about this...

               MARGO
      About what? 

               KAREN
          (indicating their
           predicament)
      This. I can't tell you how sorry I
      am!

               MARGO
      Don't give it another thought, one
      of destiny's many pranks. After
      all, you didn't personally drain
      the gasoline out of the tank...

She snuggles down into her furs. Karen flashes an unhappy
look at her. She, too, snuggles down...

EXT. THEATER ALLEY - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT

The snow has been shoveled to either side of the alley,
making a lane. The performance is just over. 

Addison, his back to us, stands looking toward the stage
door. A few actors, on their way out. 

               ADDISON'S VOICE
      Eve, of course, was superb. Many of
      the audience understandably
      preferred to return another time to
      see Margo.
      But those who remained cheered
      loudly, lustily and long for Eve...
      how thoughtful of her to call and
      invite me - that afternoon...

He starts to walk toward the stage door. 

               ADDISON'S VOICE
      ... and what a happy coincidence
      that several representatives of
      other newspapers happened to be
      present. All of us - invited that
      afternoon to attend an understudy's
      performance...

He goes in the stage door. 

INT. BACKSTAGE - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT

More activity than last time, the performance being just
over. Addison comes through the door, picks his way toward
Margo's dressing room. 

               ADDISON'S VOICE
      ... about which the management knew
      nothing until they were forced to
      ring up the curtain at nine
      o'clock. Coincidence. Also every
      indication of intrigue, skulduggery
      and fraud...  

The door tot he dressing room is open just a bit. Addison
pauses beside the door to listen. 

               BILL 
          (from within)
      ... you were better than all right,
      kid, you gave a performance, you
      rang a bell-

Addison uses his cane to swing the door open farther, so that
both he and WE can see as well as hear. 

INT. MARGO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Bill faces Eve, who wears Margo's costume. She is a ravishing
sight. Her eyes shine up to his radiantly:

               BILL 
          (continuing)
      - little things here and there, it
      doesn't matter. You can be proud of
      yourself, you've got a right to be. 

               EVE
          (quietly)
      Are you proud of me, Bill?

               BILL 
      I'll admit I was worried when Max
      called. I had my doubts.

               EVE
      You shouldn't have had any doubts.

               BILL
      - after all, the other day was one
      scene, the woods are full of one
      scene sensations. But you did it.
      With work and patience, you'll be a
      fine actress. If that's what you
      want to be. 

               EVE
      Is that what you want me to be? 

               BILL 
      I'm talking about you. And what you
      want. 

               EVE
      So am I. 

               BILL 
      What have I got to do with it?

               EVE
      Everything. 

               BILL 
          (lightly)
      The names I've been called. But
      never Svengali. 
          (he pats her shoulder)
      Good luck. 

He starts out. Addison ducks. 

               EVE
      Don't run away, Bill. 

               BILL 
          (stops)
      From what would I be running?

               EVE
      You're always after truth - on the
      stage. What about off?

               BILL 
          (curiously)
      I'm for it. 

               EVE
      Then face it. I have. Since that
      first night - here - in the
      dressing room. 

               BILL 
          (smiles)
      When I told you what every young
      actress should know. 

               EVE
      When you told me that whatever I
      became, it would be because of you-

               BILL 
      Your make-up's a little heavy. 

               EVE
      - and for you. 

               BILL 
          (slowly)
      You're quite a girl. 

               EVE
      You think?

               BILL 
      I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you
      heard? 

               EVE
      You hear all kinds of things. 

               BILL 
      I'm only human, rumors to the
      contrary. And I'm as curious as the
      next man...

               EVE
      Find out. 

               BILL 
          (deliberately)
      Only thing, what I go after, I want
      to go after. I don't want it to
      come after me.  

Tears come to Eve's eyes. She turns away slowly. 

               BILL 
      Don't cry. Just score it as an
      incomplete forward pass. 

He walks out. Addison ducks to avoid being seen. Eve glares
after Bill, tears the wig from her head, throws it on the
dressing table. Her glance is caught by a pair of scissors.
Swiftly, she snatches them up and in a sharp, vicious gesture
she slashes the wig. Addison knocks politely at the door. Eve
turns. 

               ADDISON
      May I come in?

               EVE
      Certainly, Mr. deWitt...

               ADDISON
          (entering)
      I expected to find this little room
      overcrowded, with a theater full of
      people at your feet...

               EVE
      I consider myself lucky they didn't
      throw things. 

She starts creaming her face, removing make-up.

               ADDISON
      Of course your performance was no
      surprise to me. After the other day
      I regarded it as no more than - a
      promised fulfilled.

               EVE
      You're more than kind. But it's
      still Miss Channing's performance.
      I'm just a carbon copy you read
      when you can't find the original...

               ADDISON
      You're more than modest.

               EVE
      It's not modesty. I just don't try
      to kid myself. 

               ADDISON
      A revolutionary approach to the
      Theater. However, if I may a
      suggestion...

               EVE
      Please do.

               ADDISON
      I think the time has come for you
      to shed some of your humility. It
      is just as false not to blow your
      horn at all as it is to blow it too
      loudly... 

               EVE
      I don't think I've done anything to
      sound off about. 

               ADDISON
      We all come into this world with
      our little egos equipped with
      individual horns. If we don't blow
      them - who will?

               EVE
      Even so. One isolated pretty good
      performance by an understudy. It'll
      be forgotten tomorrow. 

               ADDISON
      It needn't be. 

               EVE
      Even if I wanted to - as you say -
      be less humble, blow my own horn...
      how would I do it? I'm less than
      nobody. 

               ADDISON
      I am somebody. 

Eve rises. She eyes him steadily. 

               EVE
      You certainly are. 

She goes into the bathroom. 

               ADDISON
      Leave the door open a bit, so we
      can talk. 

Eve does so. 

               ADDISON
      After you change, if you're not
      busy elsewhere, we can have supper.

               EVE
          (from the bathroom)
      I'd love to! Or should I pretend
      I'm busy?

               ADDISON
          (smiling)
      Let's have a minimum of pretending.
      I'll want to do a column about you-

               EVE
      I'm not enough for a paragraph. 

               ADDISON
      - perhaps more than one. There's so
      much I want to know. I've heard
      your story in bits and pieces...
      your home in Wisconsin, your tragic
      marriage, your financial attachment
      to Margo - it started in San
      Francisco, didn't it? 
          (no answer; Addison
           smiles)
      I say - your idolatry of Margo
      started in San Francisco, didn't
      it?

               EVE
      That's right. 

               ADDISON
      San Francisco. An oasis of
      civilization in the California
      desert. Tell me, do you share my
      high opinion of San Francisco? 

               EVE
      Yes. I do. 

               ADDISON
      And that memorable night when Margo
      first dazzled you from the stage -
      which theater was it in San
      Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?

               EVE
          (a slight pause)
      Yes. The Shubert. 

               ADDISON
          (grins happily)
      A fine old theater, the Shubert.
      Full of tradition, untouched by the
      earthquake - so sorry - fire... by
      the way, what was your husband's
      name? 

               EVE
      Eddie...

               ADDISON
      Eddie what?

Eve sticks her head and naked shoulder around the door. 

               EVE
      I'm about to go into the shower, I
      won't be able to hear you...

               ADDISON
      I can wait. Where would you like to
      go? We'll make this a special
      night...

               EVE
          (trustingly)
      You take charge. 

               ADDISON
      I believe I will.

She closes the door. He leans back, lights a cigarette. 

EXT. 52ND STREET - NEW YORK - NIGHT

A cab drives up to "21."

               KAREN'S VOICE
      Some of the morning papers carried
      a little squib about Eve's
      performance. Not much, but full
      praise...
      I couldn't imagine how they found
      out about it - but Lloyd said Max's
      publicity man probably sent out the
      story...

Karen gets out of the cab, pays and goes in. 

               KAREN'S VOICE
      ... at any rate, I feel terribly
      guilty and ashamed of myself - and
      wanted nothing so much as to forget
      the whole thing. Margo and I were
      having lunch at "21" - just like
      girlfriends - with hats on...

INT. LOBBY - "21" - DAY

Karen consults her watch and the doorman as she enters. 

               KAREN
      Has Miss Channing come in?

               DOORMAN
      Not yet, Mrs. Richards...

Karen sees Eve who waits as Addison hands his hat, coat, and
cane to an attendant. She smiles, crosses to her.

               KAREN
      Eve. I've heard the most wonderful
      things about your performance-

               EVE
      Mostly relief that I managed to
      stagger through it at all...

               ADDISON
      She was magnificent. 

               KAREN
          (pleased)
      Then you've heard too. 

               ADDISON
      I was there. An eyewitness.

               KAREN
          (staggered)
      You were there? At the play - last
      night?

               ADDISON 
          (smiles)
      A happy coincidence.

               EVE
          (quickly)
      We're having lunch with a movie
      talent scout. 

               KAREN
      They certainly don't waste much
      time. 

               EVE
      Nothing definite yet - it's just to
      have lunch. 

               ADDISON
      They'll be wasting this much of
      their time at any rate. Eve has no
      intention of going to Hollywood. 

He turns to Karen, changing the subject. 

               ADDISON
      From the smartness of your dress, I
      take it your luncheon companion is
      a lady?

               KAREN
          (smiles)
      Margo. 

               ADDISON
      Margo? Lunching in public?

               KAREN
      It's new Margo. But she's just as
      late as the old one. 

               ADDISON
      She may be later than you think...

As he speaks, he crosses to pick up an evening paper, opens
it as he comes back. 

               ADDISON
          (handing it to her)
      Why not read my column to pass the
      time? The minutes will fly like
      hours...
          (he takes Eve's arm)
      ... and now we must join our
      sunburned eager beaver. 

He goes up the stairs with Eve. Karen glances after them
curiously, then at the column.
It is headed: "Things I Promised Not To Tell" by Addison
deWitt. He expression becomes increasingly horrified. She
drops the paper and rushes out...

INT. MARGO'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Addison's column quivers in Margo's hand as she strides about
reading it. Karen sits miserably. 

               MARGO
          (declaiming)
      "... my hat which has, lo, these
      many seasons become more firmly
      rooted about my ears, is lifted to
      Miss Harrington. I am once more
      available for dancing in the
      streets and shouting from the
      housetops." ... I thought that one
      went out with Woollcott... 
          (she skips part of the
           column)
      Down here... here, listen to this-
      "... Miss Harrington had much to
      tell - and these columns shall
      report her faithfully - about the
      lamentable practice in our Theater
      of permitting, shall we say -
      mature - actresses to continue
      playing roles requiring a youth and
      vigor of which they retain but a
      dim memory-"

               KAREN
      I just can't believe it. 

               MARGO
      It get better! "- About the
      understandable reluctance on the
      part of our entrenched First Ladies
      of the Stage to encourage, shall we
      say - younger - actresses; about
      Miss Harrington's own long and
      unsupported struggle for
      opportunity-"

               KAREN
      I can't believe Eve said those
      things!

Margo crumples the paper as if it were Eve's neck. 

               MARGO
          (pacing)
      In this rat race, everybody's
      guilty till they're proved
      innocent! One of the differences
      between the Theater and
      civilization... 
          (she hurls the paper away)
      ... what gets me is how all of
      those papers in town happened to
      catch that particular performance!

               KAREN
          (weakly)
      Lloyd says it's a publicity
      release...

               MARGO
      The little witch must have had
      Indians runners out snatching
      critics out of bars, steam rooms
      and museums or wherever they hole
      up... well, she won't get away with
      it! Nor will Addison deWitt and his
      poison pen! If Equity or my lawyer
      can't or won't do anything about
      it, I will personally stuff that
      pathetic little lost lamb down Mr.
      deWitt's ugly throat...

She pauses in midair to look at... Bill. He has come up the
stairs tow at a time, stands at the landing. 

               BILL 
          (quietly)
      I came as soon as I read that piece
      of filth. I ran all the way...

Margo suddenly starts to cry. She turns from him. Bill takes
her in his arms. He holds her...

               BILL 
      Bill's here, baby. Everything's all
      right, now...

Margo says nothing, just hides in his embrace. He soothes
her, pets her... he looks over at Karen. 

               KAREN
      I guess at this point I'm what the
      French call 'de trop'...

               BILL 
          (smiles)
      Maybe just a little around the
      edges.

Karen smiles back, waves, and goes out. 

INT. RICHARDS' APARTMENT - DAY

Karen's having some lunch. Lloyd, still in his robe, sits
opposite her having some coffee and a cigarette. A copy of
the interview before him. 

               LLOYD
          (is saying)
      - it's Addison, from start to
      finish, it drips with his brand of
      venom... taking advantage of a kid
      like that, twisting her words,
      making her say what he wanted her
      to say-

               KAREN
      Where'd you get all that
      information?

               LLOYD
          (put out his cigarette)
      Eve. 

               KAREN
      Eve?

               LLOYD
      She's been to see me, as a matter
      of fact she left just before you
      came in - you just missed her...

               KAREN
      That was a pity...

               LLOYD
          (gets up)
      She wanted to explain about her
      interview, wanted to apologize to
      someone - and didn't dare face
      Margo...

               KAREN
      I wonder why.

Lloyd wanders about - he seems to be searching for words, for
a position to maintain...

               LLOYD
      She started to tell me all about it
      - and she couldn't finish, she
      cried so...

He's over by a window, his back to her. Karen eyes him
curiously, waiting for the payoff...

               LLOYD
          (finally)
      You know, I've been going over our
      financial condition - if you'll
      pardon the expression...

               KAREN
      That's quite a change of subject. 

               LLOYD
          (walks again)
      What with taxes coming up - and
      since I'm a playwright and not an
      oil well operator - well, I've been
      thinking...

               KAREN
      I'm trying hard to follow you.

               LLOYD
      If - instead of waiting until next
      season to do 'Footsteps on the
      Ceiling', which is in pretty good
      shape - and if Margo can be talked
      into going on tour with 'Aged in
      Wood' - we could put 'Footsteps...'
      into production right away...

               KAREN
      I'm beginning to catch up. 

               LLOYD
      If we could cast it properly, that
      is...

               KAREN
          (carefully)
      Maybe get some younger actress for
      the part? Someone who'd look the
      part as well as play it? 

               LLOYD
          (smiles)
      You've got to admit it would be a
      novelty. 

               KAREN
      Now you're quoting Addison. Or Eve. 

A pause. 

               LLOYD
      Eve did mention the play, you know.
      But just in passing - she's never
      ask to play a part like "Cora,"
      she'd never have the nerve...

               KAREN
      Eve would ask Abbott to give her
      Costello. 

               LLOYD
      No, I got the idea myself - while
      she was talking to me...

               KAREN
      With gestures, of course. 

               LLOYD
          (wistfully)
      For once, to write something and
      have it realized completely. For
      once, not to compromise-

Now Karen explodes. She rises.

               KAREN
      Lloyd Richards, you are not to
      consider giving that contemptible
      little worm the part of "Cora."

               LLOYD
      Now just a minute-

               KAREN
      Margo Channing has not been exactly
      a compromise all these years, half
      the playwrights in the world would
      give their shirts for that
      particular compromise!

               LLOYD
          (angry)
      Now just a minute!

               KAREN
      It strikes me that Eve's disloyalty
      and ingratitude must be contagious!

Lloyd's full of anger and guilt. He snaps back.

               LLOYD
      All this fuss and hysteria because
      an impulsive kid got carried away
      by excitement and the conniving of
      a professional manure slinger named
      deWitt! She apologized, didn't she? 

               KAREN
      On her knees, I have no doubt! Very
      touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic
      Arts!

               LLOYD
      That bitter cynicism of yours is
      something you've acquired since you
      left Radcliffe!

               KAREN
      The cynicism you refer to, I
      acquired the day I discovered I was
      different from little boys!

The phone has been ringing. Lloyd snarls into it.

               LLOYD
      Hello!
          (he quiets down)
      ... hi, Margo... no, not at all,
      Karen and I were just chatting...
      hmm?... why - why, yes, I'm sure we
      can and I'm sure we'd love to...
      right... 11:45ish. See you then...

He hangs up. He smiles - suddenly, there's peace.

               LLOYD
      Margo - and Bill - want us to meet
      them at the Cub Room tonight, after
      theater. For a bottle of wine. 

               KAREN
          (smiles)
      Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't
      be more surprised if she'd said
      Grant's Tomb. 

               LLOYD
      I'm glad Bill's back. 

               KAREN
      They'd die without each other. 

A pause. 

               LLOYD
      Darling, I didn't promise Eve
      anything. Just said I thought she'd
      be fine for the part, but there
      were some practical difficulties...

               KAREN
      Such as?

               LLOYD
          (grins)
      You - for one. I told her you were
      set on Margo playing the part - and
      I certainly wouldn't make a change
      without your approval. 

Karen smiles happily.

               KAREN
      That's fine. Fine and dandy. I'd
      enjoy nothing more. Just refer all
      of Miss Harrington's future
      requests to me...

INT. CUB ROOM - STORK CLUB - NIGHT

Margo, Karen, Bill and Lloyd are ensconced happily at a table
in the rear of the room. A bottle of fine wine is being
poured. Their mood is equally bubbly. 

               BILL
      The so-called art of acting is not
      one for which I have a particularly
      high regard...

               MARGO
      Hear, hear...

               BILL 
      But you may quote me as follows.
      Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing
      gave a performance in your
      cockamamie play, the like of which
      I have never seen before and expect
      rarely to see again. Unquote. 

               MARGO
      He does not exaggerate. I was good. 

               BILL 
      You were great. 

As they look at each other, they reflect the understanding
that has hit them both at last. 

               LLOYD
      It's been quite a night. I
      understand that your understudy -
      Miss Harrington - has given her
      notice. 

               MARGO
          (eyes still on Bill)
      Too bad. 

               BILL 
          (eyes still on Margo)
      I'm broken up about it...

The wine has been poured by now. 

               LLOYD
      For some reason you can't just pick
      up champagne and drink it.
      Somebody's got to be very witty
      about a toast.     
          (he lifts his glass)
      For instance...

               BILL 
          (abruptly)
      I'm going to propose the toast.
      Without wit. With all my heart. 

Lloyd lowers his glass. There's a little pause. 

               BILL 
      To Margo. To my bride-to-be.

               MARGO
      Glory Hallelujah.

               LLOYD
      Well of all-

               KAREN
      Margo!

               BILL 
      Drink.

They drink, then burst into a flurry of questions. 

               KAREN
      When? When are you going to do it?

               BILL 
      Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at
      ten-
          (to Margo)
      - and you're going to be on time. 

               MARGO
      Yes, sir. 

               LLOYD
      City Hall, that's for prize
      fighters, and reporters - I see a
      cathedral, a bishop, banks of
      flowers...

               BILL 
      It's only for the license. There's
      a three-day wait - blood tests,
      things like that...

               MARGO
      I'll marry you if it turns out you
      have no blood at all. 

               LLOYD
      Three days, that's for the
      bourgeois - I see a midnight
      elopement, waking up a village
      person...

               KAREN
          (to Margo)
      What are you going to wear?

               MARGO
      Something simple. A fur coat over a
      nightgown...

               BILL 
      The point is - in the cathedral, a
      ball park or a penny arcade - we
      want to have you two beside us our
      nearest and dearest friends.

Lloyd fills all the glasses. 

               LLOYD
      There are very few moments in life
      as good as this. Let's remember it.
          (he lifts his glass)
      To each of us and all of us...
      never have we been more close - may
      we never be farther apart.

They drink. A waiter approaches with a note. 

               WAITER
      Mrs. Richards?

               KAREN
      Yes?

               WAITER
      For you. 

Karen stares at it curiously, then opens it. 

               LLOYD
      Very discreet. A note right out in
      the open like that. Next time tell
      your lover to blow smoke rings - or
      tap a glass...

               MARGO
      Lloyd, I want you to be big about
      this... the world is full of love
      tonight, no woman is safe...

               KAREN
          (angrily)
      This beats all world's records for
      running, standing and jumping gall!

She whips the note to Margo, who reads it aloud. 

               MARGO
          (reading)
      "Please forgive me for butting into
      what seems such a happy occasion -
      but it's most important that I
      speak with you. Please" - it's
      underlined - "meet me in the
      Ladies' Room. Eve."

               BILL 
      I understand she is now the
      understudy in there. 

               MARGO
          (looking about)
      Pass me the empty bottle. I may
      find her... why, look. There's
      Rasputin. 

Addison sits near the entrance, at a banquette table for two.
A crumpled napkin and a wine glass indicate Eve's place. He
nibbles daintily at some blini. 

Margo hails a passing captain.

               MARGO
      Encore du champagne.

               CAPTAIN
      More champagne, Miss Channing?

               MARGO
      That's what I said, bub.

               LLOYD 
          (to Karen)
      After all, maybe she just wants to
      apologize...

               KAREN
      I have no possible interest in
      anything she'd have to say.

               BILL 
      But what could she say? That's what
      fascinates me...

               LLOYD
      Go on - find out...

               MARGO
      Karen, in all the years of our
      friendship, I have never let you go
      to the Ladies' Room alone. But now
      I must. I am busting to know what
      goes on in that feverish little
      brain waiting there...

               KAREN
      Well... all right.

She gets up and goes. The CAMERA takes her past Addison's
table. He rises in polite surprise. 

               ADDISON
      Karen! How nice...

She walks past him without a word. He smiles, looks toward
the group. He raises his glass in a toast. 

Margo responds to the toast by waving an onion with a grand
flourish, then eating it. 

               BILL 
      Very effective. But why take it out
      on me? 

He eats one in self-defense. 

INT. LADIES' ROOM - STORK CLUB - NIGHT

Never having been, I can't say what it looks like. It is to
be hoped that there is an outer and inner room. We are
concerned with the outer. 

There is an attendant in charge, and a constantly changing
flow of ladies who pause to make various repairs. All cafe
society - including one young drunk stretched out under a
mink coat and a wet towel.

There are two chairs - or a banquette - in a corner. Eve
waits there. She rises as Karen approaches. 

               EVE
      I was wondering whether you'd come
      at all..

               KAREN
      Don't get up.
          (she smiles grimly)
      And don't act as if I were the
      queen mother. 

               EVE
      I don't expect you to be pleasant. 

               KAREN
      I don't intend to be. 

               EVE
      Can't we sit down? Just for a
      minute...

She sits down. Karen remains standing.

               EVE
      I've got a lot to say. And none of
      it is easy. 

               KAREN
      There can't be very much-

               EVE
      Oh, but there is-

               KAREN
      - and easy or not, I won't believe
      a word. 

               EVE
      Why shouldn't you?
          (a pause)
      Please sit down. 

Karen sits, reluctantly and rigidly.

               EVE
      You know, I've always considered
      myself a very clever girl. Smart.
      Good head on my shoulders, that
      sort of thing, never the wrong word
      at the wrong time... but then, I'd
      never met Addison deWitt.
          (another pause)
      I remember once I had a tooth
      pulled. They gave me some
      anaesthetic - I don't remember the
      name - and it affected me in a
      strange way. I heard myself saying
      things I wasn't even thinking... as
      if my mind were someplace outside
      of my body, and couldn't control
      what I did or said-

               KAREN
          (leading her on)
      - and you felt just like that
      talking to Addison. 

               EVE
          (nods)
      In a way. You find yourself trying
      to say what you mean, but somehow
      the words change - and they become
      his words - and suddenly you're not
      saying what you mean, but what he
      means-

               KAREN
          (sharply)
      Do you expect me to believe that
      you didn't say any of those things -
      that they were all Addison?

               EVE
      No! I don't expect you to believe
      anything. Except that the
      responsibility is mine. And the
      disgrace. 

               KAREN
      Let's not get over-dramatic. 

               EVE
          (smiles grimly)
      You've really got a low opinion of
      me, haven't you? We'll I'll give
      you some pleasant news. I've been
      told off in no uncertain terms all
      over town. Miss Channing should be
      happy to hear that. To know how
      loyal her friends are - how much
      more loyal they are than she had a
      right to expect me to be...

She turns away from Karen. Karen's embarrassed. 

               KAREN
      Eve... don't cry. 

               EVE
          (turned away)
      I'm not crying.

               KAREN
      Tell me. How did your lunch turn
      out - with the man from Hollywood? 

               EVE
      Some vague promises of a test,
      that's all - if a particular part
      should come along, one of those
      things-

               KAREN
      But the raves about your
      performance-

               EVE
      - an understudy's performance. 

               KAREN
      Well. I think you're painting the
      picture a little darker than it is,
      really. If nothing else - and don't
      underestimate him - you have a
      powerful friend in Addison. 

               EVE
      He's not my friend. You were my
      friends...

               KAREN
      He can help you. 

               EVE
      I wish I'd never met him, I'd like
      him to be dead... I want my friends
      back. 

This time she does cry. Softly, miserably. Karen looks about.
A pause. She puts an arm around Eve. 

               KAREN
      Eve. I - I don't think you meant to
      cause unhappiness. But you did.
      More to yourself, perhaps - as it
      turned out - than to anyone else...

               EVE
      I'll never get over it. 

               KAREN
          (smiles)
      Yes, you will. You Theater people
      always do. Nothing is forever in
      the Theater. Love or hate, success
      or failure - whatever it is, it's
      here, it flares up and burns hot -
      and then it's gone. 

               EVE
      I wish I could believe that. 

               KAREN
      Give yourself time. Don't worry too
      much about what people think,
      you're very young and very
      talented... 
          (she gets up, her hand
           still on Eve's shoulder)
      ... and, believe it or not, if
      there's anything I can do-

Eve has reached up to take Karen's hand. She holds it now, as
she turns slowly to face her. 

               EVE
      There is something. 

Karen stares down at her. Eve's eyes burn into tears. Karen
is caught, fascinated by them. 

               KAREN
      I think I know...

               EVE
      Something most important you can
      do. 

               KAREN
      You want to play "Cora." You want
      me to tell Lloyd I think you should
      play it. 

               EVE
      If you told him so, he'd give me
      the part. He said he would. 

               KAREN
      After all you've said... don't you
      know the part was written for
      Margo? 

               EVE
      It could have been - fifteen years
      ago. It's my part now. 

               KAREN
      You talk just as Addison said you
      did. 

               EVE
      "Cora" is my part. You've got to
      tell Lloyd it's for me. 

               KAREN
      I don't think anything in the world
      could make me say that. 

She turns away again, but Eve's grip is like a vise. 

               EVE
      Addison wants me to play it. 

               KAREN
      Over my dead body...

               EVE
          (cold, relentless)
      That won't be necessary. Addison
      knows how Margo happen to miss that
      performance - how I happened to
      know she'd miss it in time to call
      him and notify every paper in
      town...
          (Karen stops struggling)
      ... it's quite a story.
      Addison could make quite a thing of
      it - imagine how snide and vicious
      he could get and still write
      nothing but the truth. I had a time
      persuading him...
          (she smiles, now)
      ... you'd better sit down. You look
      a bit wobbly. 
          (Karen sits)
      If I play "Cora," Addison will
      never tell what happened - in or
      out of print. A simple exchange of
      favors. And I'm so happy I can do
      something for you - at long last...
          (Karen covers her face
           with her hands)
      Your friendship with Margo - your
      deep, close friendship - what would
      happen to it, do you think, if she
      knew the chap trick you'd played on
      her - for my benefit? And you and
      Lloyd - how long, even in the
      Theater, before people forgot what
      happened - and trusted you again?
          (now Eve gets up)
      No... it would be so much easier on
      everyone concerned, if I were to
      play "Cora." And so much better
      theater, too...

Karen looks up slowly.

               KAREN
      A part in a play. You'd do all that
      - just for a part in a play. 

               EVE
          (smiles)
      I'd do much more - for a part that
      good.

She leaves. Karen is alone. 

INT. CUB ROOM - NIGHT

Eve enters and slides in beside Addison. 

               ADDISON
      Hungry?

               EVE
      Just some coffee. 

               ADDISON
          (pours)
      I'm not surprised. After all that
      humble pie...

               EVE
      Nothing of the kind. Karen and I
      had a nice talk. 

               ADDISON
      Heart to heart? Woman to woman?
      Including a casual reference to the
      part of "Cora" - and your hopes of
      playing it. 

               EVE
      I discussed it very openly. I told
      her that I had spoken to Lloyd -
      and that he was interested. 

               ADDISON
      She mentioned, of course, that
      Margo expects to play the part?

               EVE
      Oddly enough - she didn't say a
      word about Margo. Just that she'll
      be happy to do what she can to see
      that I play the part.   

Addison puffs at his cigarette, bemused. 

               ADDISON
      Just like that, eh?

               EVE
      Just like that. 

               ADDISON
          (thoughtfully)
      Do you know, Eve - sometimes I
      think you keep things from me. 

Eve's feelings are hurt. 

               EVE
      I don't think that's funny. 

               ADDISON
      It wasn't meant to be. 

               EVE
      I confide in you and rely on you
      more than anyone I've ever known!
      To say a thing like that now -
      without any reason - when I need
      you more than ever...

               ADDISON
          (breaks in)
      I hope you mean what you say, Eve.
      I intend to hold you to it. 

Their eyes meet. 

               ADDISON
      We have a great deal in common, it
      seems to me...

They both look as Karen passes them on her way back to her
table. 

GROUP, as Karen joins them. Another bottle of champagne has
come and almost gone - there's a fine, cheery feeling among
them. Margo, in particular, is cheery. A pause. Karen downs a
glass of champagne.

               LLOYD
      - well? What happened?

               KAREN
      Nothing much. She apologized. 

               MARGO
      With tears?

               KAREN
      With tears. 

               MARGO
      But not right away? First the
      business of fighting them off, chin
      up, stout fella...

               KAREN
      Check. 

               MARGO
      Very classy stuff, lots of
      technique-

               LLOYD
      You mean - all this time - she'd
      done nothing but apologize? What'd
      you say? 

               KAREN
      Not much.

               MARGO
      Groom-
          (Bill says "huh?")
      - may I have a wedding present? 

               BILL 
      What would you like? Texas?

               MARGO
      I want everybody to shut up about
      Eve. Just shut up about Eve, that's
      all I want. Give Karen more wine...
          (blissfully)
      ... never have I been so happy.
      Isn't this a lovely room? The Cub
      Room. What a lovely, clever name.
      Where the elite meet. Never have I
      seen so much elite - and all with
      their eyes on me. Waiting for me to
      crack that little gnome over the
      noggin with a bottle. But not
      tonight. Even Eve. I forgive Eve...
      there they go.  

They all look. 

ADDISON AND EVE, they get up and go without looking back.

GROUP, they watch for an instant. 

               MARGO
      There goes Eve. Eve evil, Little
      Miss Evil. But the evil that men do
      - how does it go, groom? Something
      about the good they leave behind -
      I played it once in rep in Wilkes
      Barre...

               BILL 
      You've got it backwards. Even for
      Wilkes-Barre.

               MARGO
      You know why I forgive Eve? Because
      she's left good behind - the four
      of us, together like this, it's
      Eve's fault - I forgive her...

Karen's reactions are, of course, most important. Knowing
what she's done to Margo - wondering how to do what she must. 

               MARGO
      ... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve
      did that, too. 

               LLOYD
      You know, she probably means well,
      after all...

               MARGO
      She is a louse. 

               BILL 
          (to Lloyd)
      Never try to outguess Margo. 

               MARGO
      Groom.

               BILL 
      Yes, dear. 

               MARGO
      You know what I'm going to be?

               BILL 
      A cowboy. 

               MARGO
      A married lady. 

               BILL 
      With the paper to prove it. 

               MARGO
      I'm going to have a home. Not just
      a house I'm afraid to stay in...
      and a man to go with it. I'll look
      up at six o'clock - and there he'll
      be... remember, Karen? 

               KAREN
          (quietly)
      I remember. 

               MARGO
          (to Bill)
      You'll be there, won't you. 

               BILL 
          (grins)
      Often enough to keep the franchise. 

               MARGO
      A foursquare, upright, downright,
      forthright married lady... that's
      for me. And no more make believe!
      Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd.
          (Lloyd nods)
      I mean it, now. Grown-up women
      only, I might even play a mother -
      only one child, of course, not over
      eight...     
          (they all smile)
      Lloyd, will you promise not to be
      angry with me? 

               LLOYD
          (smiles)
      That depends. 

               MARGO
      I mean really, deeply angry...

               LLOYD
      I don't think I could be.

               MARGO
      Well. I don't want to play "Cora."

               KAREN
          (explodes)
      What?

Margo misinterprets her vehemence. 

               MARGO
          (hastily)
      Now wait a minute, you're always so
      touchy about his plays, it isn't
      the part - it's a great part. And a
      fine play. But not for me anymore -
      not a foursquare, upright,
      downright, forthright married lady.

               LLOYD
      What's your being married got to do
      with it? 

               MARGO
      It means I've finally got a life to
      live! I don't have to play parts
      I'm too old for - just because I've
      got nothing to do with my nights!
          (then quietly)
      I know you've made plans. I'll make
      it up to you, believe me. I'll tour
      a year with this one, anything -
      only you do understand - don't you,
      Lloyd?

Lloyd never gets to answer. Because Karen, before anyone can
stop her, bursts into hysterical laughter...

               LLOYD
      What's so funny?

               KAREN
      Nothing...

               BILL 
      Nothing?

               KAREN
      Everything... everything's so
      funny... 

Margo removes the champagne glass from in front of Karen...

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. THEATER - CURRAN THEATER - DAY

Karen is seated unobtrusively in a rear lower box. Lloyd sits
beside Max up front.

On stage, the play is "on its feet." Eve plays a dramatic
scene with a young man. They carry "sides" but do not consult
them.

As she speaks, Eve moves upstage, turns to face the young man
who is forced to turn his back to the auditorium. 

Bill calls a halt. He indicates to Eve that she was to have
remained downstage. 

Eve seems to be at a loss. She looks at Lloyd. 

Lloyd rises, says that he told her to make the change. 

Bill comes down to the footlights to tell him to stick to
writing, he'll do the directing. It mounts swiftly to a
screaming fight. Bill throws the script out into the
auditorium, takes his coat and stalks off.

Eve runs after him. Max retrieves the script. Lloyd remains
adamant. Karen has risen in dismay. 

Eve drags Bill back. Without looking at Lloyd, he takes the
script from Max, tells the actors to pick up where they left
off. 

Eve whispers to Lloyd from the stage. Lloyd smiles,
mollified, sits down again with Max. 

Karen walks up the side aisle, out of the theater...

               KAREN'S VOICE
      Lloyd never got around, somehow -
      to asking me whether it was all
      right with me for Eve to play
      "Cora"... Bill, oddly enough,
      refused to direct the play at first
      - with Eve in it. Lloyd and Max
      finally won him over... Margo never
      came to a rehearsal, too much to do
      around the house, she said. I'd
      never known Bill and Lloyd to fight
      as bitterly and as often... and
      always over some business for Eve,
      or a move or the way she read a
      speech... but then I'd never known
      Lloyd to meddle as much with Bill's
      directing - as far as it affected
      Eve, that is... somehow, Eve kept
      them going. Bill stuck it out - and
      Lloyd seemed happy - and I thought
      it might be best if I skipped
      rehearsals from then on... 

INT. RICHARDS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

It is a lovely, large room. Two double beds, not alongside
each other and each with an extension phone beside it. In
addition to the door to the living room, there are two more -
to separate dressing rooms and baths. Lloyd is asleep. But
not Karen. She turns restlessly, finally sits up, lights a
cigarette. 

               KAREN'S VOICE
      It seemed to me I had known always
      that it would happen - and here it
      was.
      It felt helpless, that helplessness
      you feel when you have no talent to
      offer - outside of loving your
      husband. How could I compete?
      Everything Lloyd loved about me, he
      had gotten used to long ago... 

The phone jangles suddenly, startling her. It wakes Lloyd up.
Karen answers. 

               KAREN
      Hello... who?... who's calling Mr.
      Richards?

INT. ROOMING HOUSE - NIGHT

A girl, in a wrapper, at a wall phone. Her hair's in curlers.
She's frightened. 

               GIRL
      My name wouldn't mean anything. I
      room across the hall from Eve
      Harrington, and she isn't well.
      She's been crying all night and
      hysterical, and she doesn't want a
      doctor...

RICHARDS' BEDROOM, Lloyd is sitting on the edge of the bed,
looking over...

               LLOYD
      Who is it? What's it all about?

               KAREN
          (into phone)
      Did Miss Harrington tell you to
      call Mr. Richards?

Lloyd picks up his phone. 

ROOMING HOUSE

               GIRL
      No, Eve didn't say to call him, but
      I remembered I saw Mr. Richards
      with her a couple of times - and I
      thought they being such good
      friends...

RICHARDS' BEDROOM

               LLOYD
          (into phone)
      Hello...hello, this is Lloyd
      Richards. Where is Eve? Let me talk
      to her-

ROOMING HOUSE

               GIRL
      She's up in her room, Mr. Richards.
      I really hate to bother you like
      this, but the way Eve's been
      feeling - I'm just worried sick
      what with her leaving for New Haven
      tomorrow, and everything...

RICHARDS' BEDROOM

               LLOYD
      Tell her not to worry - tell her
      I'll be right over. 

ROOMING HOUSE

               GIRL
      I'll tell her, Mr. Richards.

She hangs up. As she moves from the phone, the ANGLE WIDENS
to disclose Eve at the foot of the stairs. The girls smile at
each other. They go upstairs, arm in arm. 

RICHARDS' BEDROOM, Karen is still in bed, phone still in her
hand. She hangs up, swings her legs out, puts out her
cigarette, gets into a robe. The open door and light of the
dressing room tell us where Lloyd is.

Karen walks to the door, starts to say something, changes her
mind. She crosses to a table, lights a fresh cigarette, comes
back to the door. 

               KAREN
          (finally)
      Aren't you... broadening the duties
      of a playwright just a bit? Rushing
      off in the middle of the night 
      like a country doctor?

No answer except the opening and closing of drawers. 

               KAREN
      What would you do if, instead of
      Eve, the leading man had called up
      to say her was hysterical?

Still no answer. Her tension increasing, Karen goes back to
the table, snubs out the fresh cigarette, then strides
swiftly back to the open door. 

               KAREN
      Lloyd, I don't want you to go!

Now Lloyd appears. He's in flannels, and a sport shirt with
no tie. He's confused and guilty and tortured.

               LLOYD
      I didn't think you would! It seems
      to me, Karen, that for some tine,
      now, you've been developing a deep
      unconcern for the feeling of human
      being in general-

               KAREN
      I'm a human being, I've got some!

               LLOYD
          (goes right on)
      - and for my feelings in
      particular! For my play, my career -
      and now for a frightened,
      hysterical girl on the eve of her
      first night in the Theater!

He goes back into his room. 

               KAREN
      Have you forgotten about Eve? What
      she is, what she's done?

               LLOYD
      Old wives' tales, born of envy and
      jealousy! And a phobia against
      truth!

               KAREN
      Then tell me this isn't true! That
      your concern for your play and
      career is one thing - and that poor
      frightened hysterical girl another -
      and that your concern for her has
      nothing to do with either your play
      or your career!

Lloyd comes out wearing a jacket. He crosses to the door,
Karen after him.

               KAREN
      That first, last, and foremost -
      your reason for going now is that
      you want to be with Eve! Three in
      the morning or high noon - play or
      no play - wife or no wife!
          (Lloyd stops at the door)
      Isn't it true, Lloyd?

Lloyd goes out. Karen looks after him, despairing.

EXT. SHUBERT THEATER - NEW HAVEN - DAY

The theater is but a few doors from the TAFT HOTEL. The
marquee announces a new play by Lloyd Richards, presented by
Max Fabian, opening tonight. 

Addison and Eve stand before the theater admiring her photo
on a lobby display. None of the actors are starred. 

               ADDISON'S VOICE
      To the Theater world - New Haven,
      Connecticut, is a short stretch of
      sidewalk between the Shubert
      Theater and the Taft Hotel,
      surrounded by what looks very much
      like a small city. It is here that
      managers have what are called out
      of-town openings - which are
      openings for New Yorkers who want
      to go out of town...

They start for the hotel - Eve's arm through Addison's.

               EVE
      What a day - what a heavenly day...

               ADDISON
      D-day.

               EVE
      Just like it. 

               ADDISON
      And tomorrow morning you will have
      won your beachhead on the shores of
      Immortality...

               EVE
          (grins)
      Stop rehearsing your column...
      Isn't it strange, Addison?
      I thought I'd be panic-stricken,
      want to run away or something.
      Instead, I can't wait for tonight
      to come. To come and go...

               ADDISON
      Are you that sure of tomorrow?

               EVE
      Aren't you?

               ADDISON
      Frankly - yes.

They've arrived in front of the hotel. 

               EVE
      It'll be a night to remember. It'll
      bring to me everything I've ever
      wanted. The end of an old road -
      and the beginning of a new one...

               ADDISON
      All paved with diamonds and gold?

               EVE
      You know me better than that. 

               ADDISON
      Paved with what, then?

               EVE
      Stars.

She goes in. Addison follows her. 

INT. CORRIDOR - TAFT HOTEL - DAY

Addison accompanies Eve along the corridor to her door.

               EVE
      What time?

               ADDISON
      Almost four.

               EVE
      Plenty of time for a nice long nap -
      we rehearsed most of last night...

               ADDISON
      You could sleep, too, couldn't you?

               EVE
      Why not?

They've arrived at her door. She opens it. 

               ADDISON
      The mark of a true killer.
          (he holds out his hand)
      Sleep tight, rest easy - and come
      out fighting...

               EVE
      Why'd call me a killer?

               ADDISON
      Did I say killer? I meant champion.
      I get my boxing terms mixed. 

He turns to go. After a few steps-

               EVE
          (calling)
      Addison-
          (he pauses)
      - come on in for just a minute,
      won't you? There's... I've got
      something to tell you. 

Addison turns curiously, and enters behind her. 

INT. EVE'S SUITE - TAFT HOTEL - DAY

Old-fashioned, dreary and small. The action starts in the
living room and continues to the bedroom. 

Addison closes the door, crosses to a comfortable chair. 

               ADDISON
      Suites are for expense accounts.
      Aren't you being extravagant? 

               EVE
      Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd
      had a terrific row but Lloyd
      insisted... well. Can I fix you a
      drink?

She indicates a table elaborately stocked with liquor,
glasses, etc. Addison's eyebrows lift.

               ADDISON
      Also with the reluctant compliments
      of Max Fabian. 

               EVE
      Lloyd. I never have any, and he
      likes a couple of drinks after we
      finish - so he sent it up...

               ADDISON
      Some plain soda.
          (Eve starts to fix it)
      Lloyd must be expecting a record
      run in New Haven...

               EVE
      That's for tonight. You're invited.
      We're having everyone up after the
      performance. 

               ADDISON
      We're?

               EVE
      Lloyd and I.

She carries the soda to him, sits on an ottoman at his feet. 

               ADDISON
      I find it odd that Karen isn't here
      for the opening, don't you?

He sips his soda and puts away, carefully avoiding a look at
Eve. As he looks back-

               EVE
      Addison...

               ADDISON
          (blandly)
      She's always been so fantastically
      devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine
      that only death or destruction
      could keep her-

               EVE
          (breaks in)
      Addison, just a few minutes ago.
      When I told you this would be a
      night to remember - that it would
      bring me everything I wanted-

               ADDISON
          (nods)
      - something about an old road
      ending and a new one starting -
      paved with stars...

               EVE
      I didn't mean just the Theater.

               ADDISON
      What else?

Eve gets up, crosses to look out over the Common.

               EVE 
          (her back to him)
      Lloyd Richards. He's going to leave
      Karen. We're going to be married.

For just a flash, Addison's eyes narrow coldly, viciously.
Then they crinkle into a bland smile. 

               ADDISON
      So that's it. Lloyd. Still just the
      Theater, after all...

               EVE
          (turns; shocked)
      It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd
      loves me, I love him!

               ADDISON
      I know nothing about Lloyd and his
      loves - I leave those to Louisa May
      Alcott. But I do know you.

               EVE
      I'm in love with Lloyd!

               ADDISON
      Lloyd Richards is commercially the
      most successful playwright in
      America-

               EVE
      You have no right to say such
      things!

               ADDISON
      - and artistically, the most
      promising! Eve dear, this is
      Addison.

Eve drops her shocked manner like a cape. Her face lights up -
she crosses back to the ottoman. 

               EVE
      Addison, won't it be just perfect?
      Lloyd and I - there's no telling
      how far we can go... he'll write
      great plays for me, I'll make them
      be great!
          (as she sits)
      You're the only one I've told, the
      only one that knows except Lloyd
      and me...

               ADDISON
      ... and Karen.

               EVE
      She doesn't know. 

               KAREN
      She knows enough not to be here.

               EVE
      But not all of it - not that Lloyd
      and I are going to be married.

               ADDISON
          (thoughtfully)
      I see. And when was this unholy
      alliance joined?

               EVE
      We decided the night before last,
      before we came up here...

               ADDISON
          (increasingly tense)
      Was the setting properly romantic -
      the lights on dimmers, gypsy
      violins off stage?

               EVE
      The setting wasn't romantic, but
      Lloyd was. He woke me up at three
      in the morning, banging on my door -
      he couldn't sleep, he told me -
      he's left Karen, he couldn't go on
      with the play or anything else
      until I promised to marry him... we
      sat and talked until it was light.
      He never went home...

               ADDISON
      You sat and talked until it was
      light...

               EVE
          (meaningly)
      We sat and talked, Addison. I want
      a run of the play contract. 

               ADDISON
          (quietly)
      There never was, there'll never be
      another like you. 

               EVE
          (happily)
      Well, say something - anything!
      Congratulations, skol - good work,
      Eve!

Addison rises slowly, to his full height. As Eve watches him,
as her eyes go up to his, her smile fades-

               ADDISON
      What do you take me for?

               EVE
          (cautiously)
      I don't know what I take you for
      anything...

               ADDISON
          (moving away)
      It is possible - even conceivable -
      that you've confused me with that
      gang of backward children you've
      been playing tricks on - that you
      have the same contempt for me that
      you have for them?

               EVE
      I'm sure you mean something by
      that, Addison, but I don't know
      what...

               ADDISON
      Look closely, Eve, it's time you
      did. I am Addison deWitt. I'm
      nobody's fool. Least of all -
      yours.

               EVE
      I never intended you to be.

               ADDISON
      Yes, you did. You still do. 

Eve gets up, now. 

               EVE
      I still don't know what you're
      getting at. Right now I want to
      take my nap. It's important that I-

               ADDISON
          (breaks in)
      - it's important right now that we
      talk. Killer to killer.

               EVE
          (wisely)
      Champion to champion. 

               ADDISON
      Not with me, you're no champion.
      You're stepping way up in class. 

               EVE
      Addison, will you please say what
      you have to say plainly and
      distinctly - and then get out so I
      can take my nap!

               ADDISON
      Very well, plainly and distinctly.
      Although I consider it unnecessary -
      because you know as well as I, what
      I am about to say.
          (they are now facing each
           other)
      Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will
      not leave Karen for you. 

               EVE
      What do you mean by that?

               ADDISON
      More plainly and more distinctly? I
      Have not come to New Haven to see
      the play, discuss your dreams, or
      to pull the ivy from the walls of
      Yale! I have come to tell you that
      you will not marry Lloyd - or
      anyone else - because I will not
      permit it. 

               EVE
      What have you got to do with it?

               ADDISON
      Everything. Because after tonight,
      you will belong to me. 

               EVE
      I can't believe my ears...

               ADDISON
      A dull cliche.

               EVE
      Belong - to you? That sound
      medieval - something out of an old
      melodrama...

               ADDISON
      So does the history of the world
      for the past twenty years. I don't
      enjoy putting it as bluntly as
      this, frankly I had hoped that you
      would, somehow, have known - have
      taken it for granted that you and
      I...

               EVE
      ... taken it for granted? That you
      and I...

She smiles. Then she chuckles, then laughs. A mistake.
Addison slaps her sharply across the face. 

               ADDISON
          (quietly)
      Remember as long as you live, never
      to laugh at me. At anything or
      anyone else - but never at me.

Eve eyes him coldly, goes to the door, throws it open.

               EVE
      Get out!

Addison walks to the door, closes it. 

               ADDISON
      You're too short for that gesture.
      Besides, it went out with Mrs.
      Fiske.

               EVE
      Then if you won't get out, I'll
      have you thrown out.

She goes to the phone. 

               ADDISON
      Don't pick it up! Don't even put
      your hand on it...

She doesn't. Her back is to him. Addison smiles. 

               ADDISON
      Something told you to do as I say,
      didn't it? That instinct is worth
      millions, you can't buy it, cherish
      it, Eve. When that alarm goes off,
      go to your battle stations...

He comes up behind her. Eve is tense and wary.

               ADDISON
      Your name is not Eve Harrington. It
      is Gertrude Slescynski.

               EVE
      What of it?

               ADDISON
      It is true that your parents were
      poor. They still are. And they
      would like to know how you are -
      and where. They haven't heard from
      you for three years...

               EVE
          (curtly)
      What of it?

She walks away. Addison eyes her keenly. 

               ADDISON
      A matter of opinion. Granted. It is
      also true that you worked in a
      brewery. But life in the brewery
      was apparently not as dull as you
      pictured it. As a matter of fact,
      it got less and less dull - until
      you boss's wife had your boss
      followed by detectives!

               EVE
          (whirls on him)
      She never proved anything, not a
      thing!

               ADDISON
      But the $500 you got to get out of
      town brought you straight to New
      York - didn't it?

Eve turns and runs into the bedroom, slamming the door.
Addison opens it, follows close after her... he can be seen
in the bedroom, shouting at Eve who is offscene.

               ADDISON
      That $500 brought you straight to
      New York - didn't it?

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

Eve, trapped, in a corner of the room. 

               EVE
      She was a liar, she was a liar!

               ADDISON
      Answer my question! Weren't you
      paid to get out of town?

Eve throws herself on the bed, face down, bursts in tears.
Addison, merciless, moves closer. 

               ADDISON
      Fourth. There was no Eddie - no
      pilot - and you've never been
      married! That was not only a lie,
      but an insult to dead heroes and to
      the women who loved them...
          (Eve, sobbing, puts her
           hands over her ears;
           Addison, closer, pulls
           them away)
      ... Fifth. San Francisco has no
      Shubert Theater and North Shore,
      you've never been to San Francisco!
      That was a stupid lie, easy to
      expose, not worthy of you...

Eve twists to look up at him, her eyes streaming.

               EVE
      I had to get in, to meet Margo! I
      had to say something, be somebody,
      make her like me!

               ADDISON
      She did like you, she helped and
      trusted you! You paid her back by
      trying to take Bill away!

               EVE
      That's not true!

               ADDISON
      I was there, I saw you and heard
      you through the dressing room door!

Eve turns face down again, sobbing miserably.

               ADDISON
      You used my name and my column to
      blackmail Karen into getting you
      the part of "Cora" - and you lied
      to me about it!

               EVE
          (into the bed)
      No-no-no...

               ADDISON
      I had lunch with Karen not three
      hours ago. As always with women who
      want to find out things, she told
      more than she learned...
          (he lets go of her hands)
      ... do you want to change your
      story about Lloyd beating at your
      door the other night?

Eve covers her face with her hands. 

               EVE
      Please... please...

Addison get off the bed, looks down at her. 

               ADDISON
      That I should want you at all
      suddenly strikes me as the height
      of improbability. But that, in
      itself, is probably the reason.
      You're an improbable person, Eve,
      and so am I. We have that in
      common. Also a contempt for
      humanity, an inability to love or
      be loved, insatiable ambition - and
      talent. We deserve each other. Are
      you listening to me?

Eve lies listlessly now, her tear-stained cheek against the
coverlet. She nods.

               ADDISON
      Then say so. 

               EVE
      Yes, Addison.

               ADDISON
      And you realize - you agree how
      completely you belong to me?

               EVE
      Yes, Addison.

               ADDISON
      Take your nap, now. And good luck
      for tonight.

He starts out. 

               EVE
          (tonelessly)
      I won't play tonight.
          (Addison pauses)
      I couldn't. Not possibly. I
      couldn't go on...

               ADDISON
          (smiles)
      Couldn't go on? You'll give the
      performance of your life.

He goes out. The CAMERA REMAINS on Eve's forlorn, tear
stained face. Her eyes close... she goes to sleep.

INT. DINING HALL - SARAH SIDDONS SOCIETY - NIGHT

THE STOPPED ACTION of Eve reaching out for the award. The
applause and bulb-popping still going on.

               ADDISON'S VOICE
      And she gave the performance of her
      life. And it was a night to
      remember, that night...

THE ACTION picks up where it left off. Eve accepts the award
from the Aged Actor, kisses him tenderly, folds the award to
her bosom and waits for quiet.

She speaks with assurance, yet modestly and humbly.

               EVE
      Honored members of Sarah Siddons
      Society, distinguished guests,
      ladies and gentlemen: What is there
      for me to say? Everything wise and
      witty has long since been said - by
      minds more mature and talents far
      greater than mine. For me to thank
      you as equals would be presumptuous
      - I am an apprentice in the Theater
      and have much to learn from you
      all. I can say only that I am proud
      and happy and that I regard this
      great honor not so much as an award
      for what I have achieved, but as a
      standard to hold against what I
      have yet to accomplish.
          (applause)
      And further, I regard it as
      bestowed upon me only in part. The
      larger share belongs to my friends
      in the Theater - and to the Theater
      itself, which has given me all I
      have. In good conscience, I must
      give credit where credit is due. To
      Max Fabian-

MAX sits erect, beaming proudly.

               EVE'S VOICE
      - dear Max. Dear, sentimental,
      generous, courageous Max Fabian -
      who took a chance on an unknown,
      untried, amateur...

EVE, after applause greets Max. 

               EVE
      And to my first friend in the
      Theater - whose kindness and
      graciousness I shall never
      forget... Karen - Mrs. Lloyd
      Richards...

KAREN resumes her doodling as applause breaks out for her...

               EVE'S VOICE
      ... and it was Karen who first
      brought me to one whom I had always
      idolized - and who was to become my
      benefactor and champion. A great
      actress and a great woman - Margo
      Channing.

MARGO, part of Eve's tribute has been over her CLOSE-UP. She
smiles grimly in reaction to the applause.

EVE looks to her right, waits for the applause to die. 

               EVE
      My director - who demanded always a
      little more than my talent could
      provide-

BILL, seated at the speakers' table. He has his award before
him - a smaller one. He puts out a cigarette expressionlessly
as the applause breaks out. 

               EVE
      - but who taught me patiently and
      well... Bill Sampson.

LLOYD sits beside Bill. He, too, has a smaller award. As Eve
speaks, he throws her a brief glance. 

               EVE'S VOICE
      And one, without whose great play
      and faith in me, this night would
      never have been. How can I repay
      Lloyd Richards?

EVE waits for the applause to die. 

               EVE
      Hoe can I repay the many others? So
      many, that I couldn't possibly name
      them all...

ADDISON smiles approvingly. 

               EVE'S VOICE
      ... whose help, guidance and advice
      have made this, the happiest night
      of my life, possible. 

EVE stares at the award for an instant, as if fighting for
self-control.

               EVE
      Although I am going to Hollywood
      next week to make a film - do not
      think for a moment that I am
      leaving you. How could I? For my
      heart is here in the Theater - and
      three thousand miles are too far to
      be away from one's heart.
      I'll be back to claim it - and
      soon. That is, if you want me back.

Another storm of applause. Much ad lib shouting as Bill and
Lloyd are summoned to pose beside her for more pictures.
People are thronging out. The Aged Actor shouts above the
hubbub...

               AGED ACTOR
      A good night to all - and to all a
      good night!

Eve disengages herself from the photographers, makes her way
toward Addison's table... Bill and Lloyd follow. CAMERA
FOLLOWS Lloyd to Karen. They kiss. He gives her the award. 

               LLOYD
      For services rendered - beyond the
      whatever-it-is-of-duty, darling.

Max bustles into the SHOT.

               MAX
      Come on! I'm the host, I gotta get
      home before the guests start
      stealing the liquor...

She and Lloyd follow Max. Addison and Eve are on their way.
Lloyd goes right by. Karen pauses at Eve.

               KAREN
      Congratulations, Eve. 

               EVE
      Thank you, Karen.

Karen goes. Eve is being constantly congratulated. Some ad
lib about seeing her at Max's party...

               MAX
          (to Addison)
      I'm giving her a very high-class
      party. It ain't like a rehearsal,
      she don't have to be late. 

               ADDISON
      As soon as the peasants stop pawing
      her. 

Max hurries out. Margo and Bill step into the SHOT. Eve turns
from a well-wisher to face her. 

               MARGO
      ... nice speech, Eve. But I
      wouldn't worry too much about your
      heart. You can always put that
      award where your heart ought to be. 

Eve looks at her wordlessly. Margo and Bill leave. Addison
and Eve are alone. The tables about them are empty. Suddenly,
her face becomes expressionless, her eyes dull... she glances
at the table.

               EVE
      I don't suppose there's a drink
      left...

               ADDISON
      You can have one at Max's. 

               EVE
          (sits)
      I don't think I'm going. 

               ADDISON
          (sighs)
      Why not?

               EVE
      Because I don't want to. 

               ADDISON
          (patiently)
      Max has gone to a great deal of
      trouble, it's going to be an
      elaborate party, and it's for you. 

               EVE
      No, it's not.
          (she holds up the award)
      It's for this. 

               ADDISON
      It's the same thing, isn't it?

               EVE
      Exactly.
          (she gives him the award)
      Here. Take it to the party instead
      of me. 

               ADDISON
      You're being childish.

A well-wisher rushes up to Eve with an "Eve, darling, I'm so
happy!" Eve rises, thanks her graciously. Then she pulls her
wrap over her shoulder.

               EVE
      I'm tired. I want to go home. 

               ADDISON
          (curtly)
      Very well. I shall drop you and go
      on to the party. I have no
      intention of missing it...

They exit from the room, now empty of everything but tables,
waiters, and the usual banquet debris. 

EXT. PARK AVENUE - NIGHT

Eve gets out of taxi in front of a fashionable apartment
hotel. She doesn't say good night to Addison, she enters the
hotel as the cab drives off. She hasn't the award with her. 

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE EVE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Smart, but not gaudy. Eve crosses from the elevator to her
apartment. She lets herself in. 

INT. EVE'S HOTEL APARTMENT - NIGHT

A small foyer, from which one door leads to the leaving room,
another to the bedroom. The bedroom and living room do not
connect except through the foyer. 

All the lights are out. Eve turns them on in the foyer, the
same as she enters the bedroom. There are some new trunks, in
various stages of being packed. Eve tosses her wrap on the
bed, goes through the foyer to the living room.

She turns on the light in the living room. CAMERA FOLLOWS her
to a smart small bar where she fixes a stiff drink. As she
turns from the bar, she stares - starts in fright - and drops
the drink. 

A young girl, asleep in a chair, wakes with a jump. She
stares at Eve, horror-stricken. 

               EVE
      Who are you?

               GIRL
      Miss Harrington...

               EVE
      What are you doing here?

               GIRL
      I - I guess I fell asleep.

Eve starts for the phone. The girl rises in panic. 

               GIRL
      Please don't have me arrested,
      please! I didn't steal anything -
      you can search me!

               EVE
          (pauses)
      How did you get in here?

               GIRL
      I hid outside in the hall till the
      maid came to turn down your bed.
      She must've forgot something and
      when she went to get it, she left
      the door open. I sneaked in and hid
      till she finished. Then I just
      looked around - and pretty soon I
      was afraid somebody'd notice the
      lights were on so I turned them off
      - and then I guess, I fell asleep.

               EVE
      You were just looking around...

               GIRL
      That's all. 

               EVE
      What for?

               GIRL
      You probably won't believe me. 

               EVE
      Probably not. 

               GIRL
      It was for my report. 

               EVE
      What report? To whom?

               GIRL
      About how you live, what kind of
      clothes you wear - what kind of
      perfume and books - things like
      that. You know the Eve Harrington
      clubs - that they've got in most of
      the girls' high schools?

               EVE
      I've heard of them.

               GIRL
      Ours was one of the first. Erasmus
      Hall. I'm the president. 

               EVE
      Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn,
      isn't it?

               GIRL
      Lots of actresses come from
      Brooklyn. Barbara Stanwyck, Susan
      Hayward - of course, they're just
      movie stars. 

Eve makes no comment. She lies wearily on the couch. 

               GIRL
      You're going to Hollywood - aren't
      you?
          (Eve murmurs "uh-huh")
      From the trunks you're packing, you
      must be going to stay a long time.

               EVE
      I might. 

               GIRL
      That spilled drink is going to ruin
      your carper. 

She crosses to it. 

               EVE
      The maid'll fix it in the morning. 

               GIRL
      I'll just pick up the broken glass.

               EVE
      Don't bother. 

The girl puts the broken glass on the bar. She starts to mix
Eve a fresh drink. 

               EVE
      How'd you get all the way up here
      from Brooklyn?

               GIRL
      Subway.

               EVE
      How long does it take?

               GIRL
      With changing and everything, a
      little over an hour.

She carries the drink over to Eve. 

               EVE
      It's after one now. You won't get
      home till all hours.

               GIRL
          (smiles)
      I don't care if I never get home. 

The door buzzer sounds. 

               EVE
      That's the door. 

               GIRL
      You rest. I'll get it...

She goes to the door, opens it. Addison stands there, the
Sarah Siddons Award in his hands. 

               ADDISON
      Hello, there. Who are you?

               GIRL
          (shyly)
      Miss Harrington's resting, Mr.
      deWitt. She asked me to see who it
      is...

               ADDISON
      We won't disturb her rest. It seems
      she left her award in the taxicab.
      Will you give it to her?

She holds it as if it were the Promised Land. Addison smiles
faintly. He knows the look. 

               ADDISON
      How do you know my name?

               GIRL
      It's a very famous name, Mr.
      deWitt. 

               ADDISON
      And what is your name?

               GIRL
      Phoebe. 

               ADDISON
      Phoebe?

               GIRL
          (stubbornly)
      I call myself Phoebe. 

               ADDISON
      Why not? Tell me, Phoebe, do you
      want some day to have an award like
      that of your own? 

Phoebe lifts her eyes to him. 

               PHOEBE
      More than anything else in the
      world. 

Addison pats her shoulder lightly. 

               ADDISON
      Then you must Miss Harrington how
      to get one. Miss Harrington knows
      all about it...

Phoebe smiles shyly. Addison closes the door. Phoebe stares
down at the award for an instant. 

               EVE'S VOICE
          (sleepy; from the living
           room)
      Who was it?

               PHOEBE
      Just a taxi driver, Miss
      Harrington. You left the award in
      his cab and he brought it back...

               EVE'S VOICE
      Oh. Put it on one of the trunks,
      will you? I want to pack it...

               PHOEBE
      Sure, Miss Harrington...

She takes the award into the bedroom, sets it on a trunk. As
she starts out, she sees Eve's fabulous wrap on the bed. She
listens. Then, quietly, she puts on the wrap and picks up the
award. 

Slowly, she walks to a large three-mirrored cheval. With
grace and infinite dignity she holds the award to her, and
bows again and again... as if to the applause of a multitude. 

                                   FADE OUT.

                     THE END
