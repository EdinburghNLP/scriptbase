<b>1   INT. AIRPLANE - DAY                                        1
</b>    On a chartered plane flying from Miami to Newark Airport.
    JACK is the captain. His copilot PAUL is seated beside
    him. In the passenger cabin, a female gymnastics team is
    celebrating a hard-won, glorious victory over the Miami
    team. They are singing, dancing in the aisles and
    drinking champagne.

    In the rear of the cabin, there are three regular pass-
    engers: a teenager, his mother, and a man who appears to
    be a BUSINESSMAN.
    The plane is flying over the coastline.
    The partition between the cockpit and the passenger cabin
    is open. Jack is very excited. He can't stop turning
    around to look at the passengers.
<b>                             JACK
</b>                      (to Paul)
               Oh my God! I can't believe my
               eyes! Look at these women! Will
               you look at the gorgeous calves on
               them?! I'm telling you, give me
               an athlete any day... Oh God!
               Look at that redhead over there,
               and look at that one! Christ,
               I hadn't noticed her.
                      (miming a heart
                       attack)
               Paul, I've just fallen madly in
               love with the most beautiful
               woman in the world...
<b>                             PAUL
</b>                      (totally
                       uninterested)
               Oh yeah? Which one?
<b>                             JACK
</b>                      (as though about
                       to keel over)
               The blonde over there, she's too
               gorgeous for words. Just look at
               those eyes, look at those
               shoulders and the way she moves.
               I'm in love. Here, take over,
               I'll be right back.

</b><b>                                                          3.
</b>

Jack gets up and Paul takes his place at the controls.
Jack makes his way up the aisle, through the girls who
are blocking the way, to the object of his affections.
She is sitting in one of the aisle seats and singing
her head off. Jack leans over and whispers, quickly and
intensely, to her.
<b>                         JACK
</b>          Hello.   I'm the captain of this
          plane.   May I ask your name?
<b>                        GIRL
</b>          Sure, my name is Jane.    Why?
<b>                        JACK
</b>          Listen, Jane, I've seen many
          beautiful women in my life but I
          swear to you, I've never, ever
          met a woman as exquisite as you
          are.
Jack kneels down before her, and the Girl looks at him,
amused. He takes her hand and places it over his heart.
<b>                        JACK
</b>          Jane, can you feel my heart? It's
          pounding. This is horrible, I
          think I'm gonna faint. Listen: I'm
          madly in love with you, I'm single
          and here's my phone number.
He hands her his business card.
<b>                        JACK
</b>          I'm putting my fate in your hands.
          If you don't call me, you'll make
          me the most miserable man on earth.
          This is no line and I'm not trying
          to get you into bed. This is
          something completely different. I
          love you Jane and if you call me I'll
          be the happiest man in the entire
          universe -- this is 'love at first
          sight.' Out of all these beautiful
          women I noticed only you, and...
The Girl laughs as Jack goes on. Meanwhile, the Busi-
nessman who was seated in the rear of the plane has
gotten up and walked over to Jack.
<b>                          BUSINESSMAN
</b>          Are you Paul?
<b>                        JACK
</b>          No, I'm not.
                 (to Jane)
<b>
</b><b>                                                     4.
</b>
          My name's Jack and I live in a
          fabulous apartment in Manhattan
          overlooking the park and...
<b>                        BUSINESSMAN
</b>          But you're the pilot, aren't you?

<b>                        JACK
</b>          Yes, I'm the pilot...
                 (to Jane)
          ... I'm not even asking for your
          phone number...
<b>                        BUSINESSMAN
</b>          Isn't there a pilot whose name is
          Paul?

<b>                        JACK
</b>                 (annoyed)
          Yeah, the copilot -- he's up
          front...
The Businessman disappears in the direction of the
cockpit.
<b>                         JACK
</b>                  (back to Jane)
          I'm leaving it all up to you,
          Jane, but if you do give me
          your phone number, then Jane,
          then...
The Businessman has reached the cockpit.
<b>                        BUSINESSMAN
</b>                 (in a low tone)
          Are you Paul?
<b>                        PAUL
</b>                 (turning around
                  nervously)
          Yeah... Are you Jim?
<b>                        BUSINESSMAN
</b>          Yeah.
He hands Paul a man's purse.
<b>                        BUSINESSMAN
</b>          Here's your cash.
<b>                        PAUL
</b>          What about the stuff?
<b>                        BUSINESSMAN
</b>          I don't have it. We've got
          problems. Too much heat. Too
<b>
</b><b>                                                       5.
</b>
          risky. We think the cops are
          on to us.
<b>                        PAUL
</b>          Whadda ya mean us?   You mean me?

<b>                        BUSINESSMAN
</b>          I mean shut up and listen. Two
          guys will be waiting for you in
          a black T-Bird, expecting the
          dope. Just ignore them. It'll
          be delivered to you on Sunday
          and picked up the following
          Thursday, okay?
<b>                        PAUL
</b>          But I won't be home, I'll be in
          the air for two weeks.
<b>                        BUSINESSMAN
</b>          That's your problem. Make
          arrangements, a deal's a deal.
          Got it!?
<b>                        PAUL
</b>          Got it.
Jack returns.
<b>                        JACK
</b>                 (bursting with
                  excitement)
          I got her phone number!   She gave
          me her phone number!
<b>                        BUSINESSMAN
</b>          That's some magnificent view,
          isn't it?
<b>                        JACK
</b>          It's wonderful -- Life is
          wonderful!
The Businessman goes back to his seat and Jack grabs
hold of the microphone.
<b>                        JACK
</b>          This is your captain speaking. In
          honor of your victory, in honor of
          your beauty, and in honor of Jane,
          the most beautiful gymnast I have
          ever met. I'm going to give you a
          little demonstration of aviation
          gymnastics -- reserved only for the
          most important guest, hip, hip...
Everyone shouts "HOORAY!" except for Paul and the

</b>
    Businessman, who remain grim.
    Jack dips the plane very low over the water and skims the
    cliffs along the coast. It is a beautiful, impressive
    stunt. There are gleeful shouts in the cabin among the
    passengers.


<b>2   INT. NEWARK AIRPORT - PASSENGER TERMINAL - DAY              2
</b>    Jack is saying an emotional goodbye to Jane as she leaves
    with her teammates. Jane finds it all very funny, but
    Jack looks totally wretched seeing her go.
    Jack and Paul walk toward the exit.

<b>                            JACK
</b>              God, what a woman!
    Paul is nervous, glancing uneasily from car to car.
<b>                            JACK
</b>              Wanna share a cab?
                               Paul
              Yeah, sure!
    A black Ford pulls up in front of them and its driver
    looks at Paul who immediately turns his back on him.

</b>              She's so beautiful! I've never
              been so in love before. Can you
              believe she gave me her phone
              number... Oh, Christ -- where is
              it?... Oh, no, don't tell me I
              lost it... It's a matter of life
              and death... Oh here it is --
              thank God!
    All the while    Jack has been rambling on, a beige car
    on the other    side of the street has slowed down. Paul
    notices it.     In the beige car, a narcotics agent, GRATON,
    is behind the    wheel with one of his colleagues sitting
    beside him.
<b>                            GRATON
</b>              They're slowing down.    Take a
              picture.
    The colleague snaps a picture of everyone who happens to
    be standing near the black Ford, including Jack and Paul.
    The black Ford pulls out. The beige car follows it.
    Paul observes all this out of the corner of his eye.
<b>                            PAUL
</b>              Listen, I need a favor, I got

</b><b>                                                         7.
</b>
          a little problem.
<b>                        JACK
</b>          Yeah, sure... Hey, look, will you
          -- look at that sparkling beauty.

A very beautiful woman is coming down the walkway with
cart overflowing with luggage. One of them falls off.
<b>                        PAUL
</b>          Yeah... I mean, it's like...
          There's this little package...
<b>                        JACK
</b>          She'll never make it with all
          that luggage she's got. I gotta
          give her a hand. Look at the
          colors in her hair! Christ, I've
          never seen a woman like her
          before...
He's about to walk off when Paul grabs him by the arm.
<b>                        PAUL
</b>          Jack, listen, can I...
<b>                        JACK
</b>          Sure you can, no problem...
          Listen, I gotta go now, I'm
          gonna see if she'll share a cab
          with me.  You take the shuttle,
          okay?
<b>                        PAUL
</b>          But I gotta explain to you
          about...
<b>                        JACK
</b>          Come over to my place tonight.
          We're having a huge party. Come
          around 9, okay? See ya later.

Jack races toward the woman and begins to help her
with the fallen luggage. We see him talking to her
and we can hear a little of what he's saying.
<b>                        JACK
</b>          As exquisite as you are...
          I think I'm gonna faint.
He kneels, takes her hand and puts it over his heart.
The young woman is flabbergasted.
A lonely-looking Paul hails the shuttle bus.

<b>3   INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT                                    3
</b>    A large, stylishly decorated apartment in Manhattan.
    A tremendous living room. A party's going on. Very
    LOUD JAZZ is PLAYING. The lights are dim. There are
    about 30 guests. Lots of young pretty women. Gourmet
    buffet. People are sitting on couches talking, others
    are eating, drinking or dancing. In a dimly-lit corner,
    Jack is kneeling before a girl sitting in an armchair.
    She is laughing as she listens to him.
<b>                             JACK
</b>                     (whispering
                      passionately)
              This is no line and I'm not
              trying to get you into bed. This
              is something completely different.
              This is 'love at first sight.'
              Oh, I'm so happy... Let me go get
              you a glass of champagne. I'll
              be right back.
    Jack gets up and goes over to the buffet. As soon as
    he's out of the girl's line of sight, he starts running
    toward the other end of the apartment. On the way he
    passes MICHAEL, who's deeply engrossed in a vehement
    conversation about modern art with a girl called SOPHIA.
    They're fighting like cats and dogs but seem to be enjoy-
    ing it.
<b>                            SOPHIA
</b>              Are you saying that's art, are
              you really saying that's art?
              Well then you explain why.
<b>                            MICHAEL
</b>              It goes back to prehistoric man.
              They had comic strips on their
              walls, for God's sake.
<b>                            JACK
</b>                     (whispering
                      in Michael's
                      ear)
              I'm having a hard time.    I'm
              working on two at once.
<b>                            MICHAEL
</b>                     (very interested)
              Oh yeah, who?
<b>                            JACK
</b>              The brunette in the armchair in
              the living room -- her name's
              Rosalie...

</b><b>                                                           9.

          And the other one?
<b>                         JACK
</b>          Clementine -- she's waiting for
          me in the den.

He moves away towards the den.
<b>                         MICHAEL
</b>                 (to Sophia)
          Wait one second for me, I'll
          be right back.
Michael walks off in the direction of Rosalie.
Paul is wandering among the guests, trying to find Jack,
he sees PETER who is talking with another young woman,
NICOLE. Peter is nodding, idly looking around, com-
pletely uninterested in the conversation.
<b>                        NICOLE
</b>          You guys have a beautiful place
          here. But the rent must be a
          killer.
Peter isn't paying attention.
<b>                        NICOLE
</b>          Isn't it a killer?
<b>                           PETER
</b>          What?...
<b>                           PETER (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh,    the rent... yeah, it's high
          but    split between the three of
          us    it isn't that bad, as long
          as    we don't eat.
Nicole laughs.
<b>                        PAUL
</b>          Hi Peter, I'm looking for Jack,
          have you seen him?

</b>          Oh hi, Paul, how are you doing?
          Yeah, sure, I'll take you to
          Jack.
                 (to Nicole)
          Excuse me for a minute.
They move away.
<b>                        PETER

          trying to get away from that woman

         for 20 minutes. That sonofabitch
         Carl is moving in on my Natalie.
         Gotta go... bye.
<b>                       PAUL
</b>         Wait -- What about Jack?

<b>                       PETER
</b>                (in a hurry)
         He's around somewhere.     Check
         under all the couches.
Paul walks off in Jack's direction. We STAY WITH Peter,
who reaches Natalie. She is talking with a very styl-
ishly-dressed, tall, young man, CARL.

<b>                       PETER
</b>         Oh Natalie, I've been looking
         for you all night.
<b>                       CARL
</b>         All night? I just saw you deep
         in conversation with Nicole!
<b>                       PETER
</b>         Deep? Hell no, we were just
         talking shop.
<b>                       NATALIE
</b>         Oh come on Peter, we all know
         what a ladies' man you are.
<b>                      PETER
</b>         Who, me? Jack's the ladies' man,
         not me. You're the only lady I'm
         after.
<b>                       CARL
</b>                (interrupting)
         So tell me, how's your project
         coming along? I heard you're not
         ready yet.
<b>                       PETER
</b>         We've still got two weeks left
         before the semi-finals. We'll
         be ready.
<b>                       CARL
</b>         We've been ready for three days
         now. We're gonna kick your ass.
<b>                       NATALIE
</b>         Their project is really incredible.
<b>                        PETER
</b>         Oh really?   You've seen it?
<b>
</b><b>                                                            11.

<b>                        NATALIE
</b>                 (smiling broadly
                  at Carl)
          No, it's top secret but he's been
          telling me about it...

<b>                        PETER
</b>                 (in a bad mood)
          Ours is incredible too.
<b>                        CARL
</b>          If you ever get it finished.
Paul comes up to Jack, who is kneeling before Clementine,
whispering passionate sweet nothings in her ear. It
appears he's gotten beyond the "This is love at first
sight" stage. He's getting down to the nitty-gritty
now. Clementine is thrilled. Paul taps Jack on the
shoulder.
<b>                        PAUL
</b>          Jack, can I talk to you for a
          second?
<b>                        JACK
</b>          Oh, hi, Paul, yeah sure...
<b>                        JACK (CONT'D)
</b>                 (to Clementine)
          ... Please darling, don't move...
          I'll be right back, okay? I'll
          bring us back some champagne...
He disappears with Paul.
<b>                        JACK
</b>          You're a lifesaver, Paul. I
          thought I'd never get away.
          Rosalie's waiting for me in the
          living room. Isn't she
          terrific?
<b>                            PAUL
</b>          Who?   Rosalie?
<b>                            JACK
</b>          Clementine.
<b>                        PAUL
</b>          Oh yeah, for sure, I dunno.
          Listen, can you do me a favor?
With some difficulty, Paul follows Jack as he picks his
way through the people dancing, heading in Rosalie's
direction.
<b>
</b><b>                                     12.
</b>
<b>              JACK
</b>Yeah... What kind of favor?
Damn, I've got to get her
a glass of champagne.
<b>              PAUL
</b>Listen, I've got a little problem.
I'm having a valuable package
delivered to me on Sunday, but I'm
not going to be home. I've got to
do the Hawaii-Tahiti-Australia
route, so can I have the package
delivered here instead?
<b>              JACK
</b>       (filling a glass
        with champagne)
Yeah, sure, of course.
       (he stops,
        thinking)
No, wait, I'm leaving for South
America tomorrow. I'll be gone
for three weeks.
<b>              JACK (CONT'D)
</b>But it's okay. Peter and Michael
will be here. They'll take care
of it.
<b>              PAUL
</b>Will you be sure to tell them
about it?
<b>               JACK
</b>Absolutely.   Don't worry about
a thing.
<b>              PAUL
</b>It'll be delivered Sunday and
picked up next Thursday, okay?
<b>              JACK
</b>Delivered Sunday picked up
Thursday. Got it. No problem.
<b>              PAUL
</b>This is a very delicate matter,
Jack. It's very important they
don't tell anybody about this
package. It could be very... uh,
embarrassing for me, you know
what I'm saying?
<b>             JACK
</b>Sure. You got it.    I'll see you
later...

    Jack is about to rejoin Rosalie.     Paul grabs his arm.
<b>                            PAUL
</b>              Not to anyone at all.    Tell
              them that, okay?

<b>                            JACK
</b>              Okay, sure, not to anyone at
              all... Look, I'm sorry Paul, but
              I gotta get back to Rosalie. Now
              go have a good time. I'll take
              care of everything.
<b>                            PAUL
</b>              Bye and thanks a lot.

<b>                            JACK
</b>              Don't mention it.
    Paul leaves.
    Jack finally reaches the armchair where Rosalie is
    sitting. He stops short, obviously disappointed.
<b>                             JACK
</b>              Uh-oh.   Too late.
    Michael is sitting next to Rosalie, right next to her.
    They get up to dance. As he passes Jack, Michael
    smiles broadly.
<b>                            MICHAEL
</b>              All's fair, old buddy...
    Jack watches a moment, then breaks into a wide smile.
<b>                            JACK
</b>                     (singing)
              Oh my darling, oh my darling,
              oh my darling Clementine.
    Jack whirls around and heads back towards Clementine.

She has already left.   The door closes on the last of the
departing guests.
<b>                        MICHAEL

          'I heard you're not ready yet.'
          'We're gonna kick your ass.' Well,
          we may be behind schedule, but
          we're still going to beat that
          sonofabitch and maybe I haven't
          scored with Natalie yet, but
          neither has he. She's not an easy
          lay, that's what I like about her.
          You know what they say: it ain't
          over till it's over.

</b>              Michael, all you want to do is
              steal Jack's girl friends. You
              don't give a shit about the women
              themselves...
<b>                            MICHAEL
</b>              That's not true. It's just that
              Sophia drives me crazy. She knows
              all the right buttons to push to
              make me mad.
<b>                            PETER
</b>                     (going into the
                      kitchen)
              Anyway, it was a great party,
              everyone had a good time...
<b>                             MICHAEL
</b>                     (still in the living
                      room, shouting to
                      Peter)
              Terrific... time.
    He, too, leaves the living room and runs into Jack, who
    has his arm around Clementine's waist as he heads toward
    his bedroom with her.

    him, dumping the ashes. Peter begins washing the glasses.

<b>                            PETER
</b>              That's not Clementine. I saw him

<b>                        MICHAEL
</b>          No, it is Clementine, the one with
          the tits this big...
<b>                        PETER
</b>          Christie's got tits that big,
          too...
<b>                        MICHAEL
</b>          Yeah, but he was with Christie at
          the beginning of the evening --
          after that he was with Rosalie
          and then with Clementine. And
          since I stole Rosalie away from
          him... Are you following this?

<b>                          PETER
</b>          I'm not.
Jack enters the kitchen in very high spirits, singing.
<b>                        JACK
</b>          Nice work if you can get it, and
          you can get it if you try... Any
          scotch left?
<b>                        PETER
</b>          Yeah, here, I just put it away.
<b>                        JACK
</b>          Sorry I can't give you guys a

          cooking.

</b>          I am, the night's still young!...
          It's gonna be a lively one. I'm
          gonna make us a little snack.
He makes up a tray with sandwiches.
<b>                         MICHAEL
</b>          So, who is it anyway -- Christie
          or Clementine?
<b>                          JACK
</b>          Maxine.    Beautiful, enchanting
          Maxine.
Peter and Michael look at one another surprised, mouthing
silently, "Maxine?"

              Rosalie?
<b>                            MICHAEL
</b>              Well, things were going great

</b>              Your old friend Sophia appeared
              and dragged you into a thrilling
              conversation about modern art and
              in the meantime Rosalie took off
              with someone else.
<b>                            MICHAEL
</b>              How did you know?
<b>                            JACK
</b>              I dunno -- lucky guess...
<b>                            MICHAEL
</b>              Well, I don't give a damn anyway,
              I have 24 drawings to hand in to
              my editor three days from now and
              I gotta work all night anyway...
              So it was all for the best. But
              you better not leave that Maxine's
              phone number lying around because
              when I'm done...
<b>                             JACK
</b>              Don't worry, I'll leave you her
              phone number on the hall table.
              If she's really terrific I'll put
              a big 'X' next to it. 'Bye, guys

    wearing his pilot's uniform. Maxine    pushes the button
    for the elevator. Jack sneaks back    into the apartment
    and leaves a note on the hall table   that says: "Maxine

    Jack is in the cockpit with his copilot, RON. The
    ENGINES are REVVING. Jack is checking gauges. He looks
    out the window idly and sees:
    The crew of another plane walking across the tarmac.
    Paul is one of the crew. Paul sees Jack and begins to
    gesture wildly, but his voice is drowned out by the noise
    of the ENGINES.
    Just seeing Paul is enough to remind Jack about his
    package.
<b>                            JACK
</b>              Damn! I forgot to tell them about

                     (to Ron)
              I gotta make a quick phone call.
              I'll be right back.

              Jack, there'll be plenty of girls
              where we're going.

</b>              Oh, c'mon, I've really got to

              one of the New Jersey delegates
              to the I.B.M. convention?
    Jack walks back towards the phone. As he walks we see
    that the plane is filled with ugly, boring businessmen.

</b>    In the architecture firm of which Peter is one of three
    partners. The whole staff, about 15 people in all, is
    gathered around a large model, the project for a big
    amusement park. They all seem worried about something.
    JERRY, one of Peter's partners, seems particularly angry.

<b>                       JERRY
</b>         Because this is the chance of a

     resting on a lace pillow. Peter looks at this object

making! What are we s'posed to
do?

Let's call Jack's mother!

         She can't stop the baby crying
         from Miami.
<b>                       MICHAEL

<b>                       PETER
</b>         No! No way! You know what a pain
         that woman is -- she'll be on the
         next plane here to move in with
         us...
<b>                       MICHAEL
</b>         Maybe I should call my mother...
<b>                       PETER
</b>         No, please -- leave the mothers
         out of this, okay?! It's only
         four days. We should be able to
         handle that, besides you know
         the rule around here: it's fine
         to have a woman over once in a
         while, but...
Michael finishes the sentence in unison with him.

Peter steps over the basket and heads towards the
elevator.

<b>                       PETER

               never held a baby -- I'll drop

     Peter is already gone.

<b>     CLERK.

<b>                             CLERK
</b>               Down there by the meat section.
     Peter heads for it purposefully. When he    gets to the
     right aisle, he stops short, taken aback:    a vast range
     of products extends before him. He starts    examining the
     baby food jars and cans of formulas, going   from one to
     the next, not knowing where to begin.

</b>     Michael is still in the hall holding Mary very clumsily
     in his arms. He is anxious. He realizes she's soaked.
     This disgusts him. He holds her at arm's length; she
     squirms. He goes and gets a towel from the bathroom,
     spreads it out on the living room couch and lays the
     baby down on it. MARY SCREAMS -- she much prefers
     Michael's arms to the couch. A panicky Michael picks her
     up again, grumbling.
<b>                             MICHAEL
</b>               Okay, okay, don't cry like that...
               I'll hold you, I'll hold you.
     He tries rather unsuccessfully to wrap the towel around
     the child. Obviously Michael is very put off by the
     smell coming from Mary.

</b>They're all good, sir.
<b>              PETER

     looking down on everyone; an efficient, practical sort
     of young woman (WOMAN #1); and another thin, pale woman
     whose baby is lying in a baby carrier in her shopping
     cart and who seems very nervous (WOMAN #2).

               My grandson's only five months old
               and he already has two teeth.
               But my daughter didn't have a
               single one at seven months -- so,

               No, actually they had to leave

     She acts out her words.

I told you they had to leave
unexpectedly.
<b>              WOMAN #1
</b>Or else you could weigh her; that
would tell you how old she is.
<b>              STORE CLERK
</b>See, my five-month-old grandson
weighs more than my neighbor's
grandson and he's nine months old.
So, y'know, how much they weigh...
doesn't mean a thing.

</b>You have no idea how weird.
<b>              WOMAN #1
</b>Or else her hair. Does she have
lots of hair?
<b>              STORE CLERK
</b>My grandson, y'know, he has so
much hair you can make a ponytail
with it! And I know some kids
who are totally bald at a year-
and-a-half. So, y'know, how much
hair they have... doesn't mean a
thing...

</b>          Yeah, well you just don't feed a
          baby. First you gotta look and
          see if she has any teeth or not.
<b>                           MICHAEL
</b>          Why?

Peter slides his finger over Mary's gums.
<b>                        PETER
</b>          I can't feel anything -- I'll
          give her the stuff for newborns

     taking care to place several towels between her bottom
     and the immaculate velvet. Mary is squirming, laughing,
     feeling great. They have already gone through half
     a box of cotton in their attempts to clean up the
     crap. But it's still all over, on their hands, on the
     baby's feet and legs, on the towels, etc.

how it goes on.

but she squirms and kicks it off with her feet.

</b>          Hold her under her arms -- I'm
          gonna try it this way.
Michael holds Mary under    her armpits.     Peter tries to put
the diaper on her. It's     hard. What's     more, it would
seem that Michael didn't    buy the right    size -- The
diaper comes all the way    up to Mary's    chin.
<b>                        PETER
</b>          What the hell kind of lousy

          better.
Peter has more or less managed to adjust the diaper.

          I don't get it. Didn't they tell

</b>          Sure they told us! So what?

Peter turns and walks toward the basket.
<b>                        PETER
</b>          The next bottle's in 45 minutes.
          I made it already. It's in the

<b>                        MICHAEL
</b>          About an hour after her bottle,
          she starts yawning. Put her to
          bed right away or it's pure hell
          for the next three hours, at least
          that's what we've noticed.
Peter has returned with the basket. The Punks look at
the baby, their eyes wide with disbelief.
<b>                        PUNK #1
</b>          What the hell is that?   A baby?

          Of course it's a baby! Now listen
          carefully: I'm giving you a can
          of the milk she's been getting.

          she's not allergic to it. I even
          put a can of the same brand in
          here for you, but in powdered form,
          understand?
Punk #1 hears "powder" and catches on.

He hands them the basket.    Punk #1 grabs the handles.

He passes the basket to Punk #2

</b>          ... Here, hold this. Okay, so
          long!
They start to leave, pressing the elevator button.

</b>                 (suddenly a little
                  worried)
          Uh... listen... maybe you could
          leave us the address or the phone
          number just in case. So we can
          find out how she's doing?
The Punks exchange a puzzled glance.
<b>                        PUNK #1
</b>          Oh, yeah, sure, the address.
                 (feebly searching
                  his pockets)
          Oh shit, I don't have it on me...

<b>                           PETER &amp; MICHAEL
</b>          So long!
The elevator has arrived.    The Punks quickly slip inside
it with the basket.
Michael closes the door.
Peter plops down in the armchair by the front door.
<b>                        PETER
</b>          Aah, relief at last!    Good riddance!
<b>                        MICHAEL
</b>          You said it! Now maybe I can get
          some work done.
He disappears in the direction of his room.
Peter is sitting    on something hard. He pulls it out from
under him, it's    a package. He looks at it, casually
reading: "Care     of Jack Collins." He tosses it to the
side. Suddenly,     it dawns on him. He leaps up, grabs
the package and    runs into Michael's room.

     Michael runs to the window.
     Peter runs like a madman through the apartment out the
     front door. He presses the button for the elevator.
     It's in use.

     He opens the door leading to the stairs and races down
     them, holding on to the bannister. He flies, overwhelmed
     by anxiety. Suddenly he trips, loses his balance and
     makes a spectacular crash landing. The package gets a
     bit crushed, and little individual packets of white powder
     spill out of it. Peter stares at them in horror.
<b>                             PETER
</b>               What the hell is this?
     He picks up a few packets and examines them.

</b>               Oh, God, no... dope!    That's all

     He starts to tremble  with fear. He picks the packets up
     as fast as he can and  hastily puts them back into what's
     left of the package;  then shoves it all into his pocket
     and continues racing  down the stairs.

They disappear inside the building. Peter is carrying
the basket in his left hand; his right hand is clenched
on the horrible package hidden in his pocket.
Just then Cop #1 comes running back, empty-handed.
Graton gets out of his car and comes up to Cop #1, show-
ing him his badge.

     Peter enters the apartment and calmly crosses through
     the house, carrying the basket.
     As soon as he's out of the cop's sight, he starts running
     like a madman down the corridor. He runs into Michael
     who was just coming to meet him.

               were those cops doing...
     Peter shuts him up, grabs him roughly under the arm and
     leads him into his room, closing the door behind them.
     Peter speaks softly but he's totally freaking out, he
     can hardly breathe.

Michael takes the package, opens the window and starts to
climb out it when Peter stops him.

</b>         Oh, by the way, I put some water
         up to boil for her bottle.
Michael disappears. Peter picks up Mary, grabs his  wal-
let and leaves the room. When he gets to the hall,  he
discovers that Cop #1 has joined Cop #2, to whom he is
whispering something. Peter holds his license out  for
them to see.

</b>     Michael is buying a pair of scissors, glue and a roll of
     Scotch tape. Then he buys a box of large diapers -- he
     chooses the ones that come in a box. Michael leaves the
     supermarket, whistling.

</b>     Michael is sitting on a bench facing the grass, with
     his back to us, he seems quite busy.
     As we CLOSE IN, we discover that he has opened the box of
     diapers and that he's holding one of them; its plastic
     has been carefully cut out with scissors.
     Casually, glancing right and left, he takes the individ-
     ual packets of white powder out of his pocket and shoves
     them into a little plastic bag from the supermarket.
     Then he carefully tapes the bag so it's well-sealed and
     flattened out, and he inserts it into the diaper, be-
     tween the plastic and the absorbent fabric.
     Next, the diaper is taped up, folded back up and put
     back in the box, neatly packed between the other ones.
     Michael closes the box again and glues it together so
     it looks as if it's never been opened. He throws all
     the other stuff away in a trash can and grabs hold of
     his brand-new box of diapers. He walks away.

     diapers and a bag of groceries.
     In addition to the two cops there are now THREE NARCOTIC
     AGENTS who are interrogating Peter. He is holding Mary.
     The basket is on an armchair.

               misunderstanding.

</b>               Okay, I'll do it.
     Michael puts down his bag of groceries, takes Mary from
     Peter and disappears with the box of diapers.
     In his room, he lays Mary down on his bed and starts
     undressing her.

</b>     Mary is lying on Michael's bed. He has just finished
     putting a regular diaper on her.
     Then Michael looks for the tampered-with diaper in the
     box. He finds it, checks that it is well-sealed, and
     places it under Mary's bottom.
     Just then Agent #3 appears in the doorway. Michael
     calmly finishes putting the dope-filled diaper on the
     baby on top of the other one. MARY is COOING. Every-
     thing appears normal. However, a trained eye might be
     very surprised by the enormous thickness of the diaper
     covering the young lady's backside. But a narcotics
     agent is not necessarily the most qualified person to
     notice something odd like this.
     Agent #3 silently observes Michael, who gives him a big
     smile as he slips on Mary's pajama bottoms. Michael
     picks Mary up and for the first time talks to her in the
     kind of silly babytalk used by adoring parents.

Michael has laid Mary down for a nap in her basket,
observed by the five cops. He now sits down, cheerful
and bubbling over with enthusiasm.

them, putting on a very urbane act.

     Razzolini's floor. They each are holding one of the
     handles on the basket. They are walking quickly.
     Suddenly Michael stops Peter.

          see...
Peter waits with the basket.   Michael tiptoes to the
corner of the corridor.

At the very end of the corridor, on Mrs. Razzolini's
doorstep, he sees the three narcotics Agents talking with
Mrs. Razzolini. We can hear snippets of their
conversation.
<b>                        RAZZOLINI

</b>          What are these people like? What
          kind of lifestyle do they have?
Michael hastily returns to Peter, still on tiptoes. He
leads him back to the elevator and pushes the elevator
button.

The elevator has arrived meanwhile.

          She's as regular as clockwork.

</b>     The three men, slumped in their car, are watching the
     door of the apartment building.

     The three narcotics Agents emerge from the building and
     walk away. A short time goes by. Peter and Michael
     emerge from the building and quickly walk away. The three
     men get out of their car, cross the street and enter the
     building.

     Peter comes out of the elevator, key in hand. He's about
     to put it in the lock on the door, but stops short -- the
     door is already open.
<b>                              PETER
</b>               Michael?   Michael, are you here?
     No answer.
     Peter pushes the door open. The sight that greets his
     eyes is very dismaying. It looks like a tornado has hit
     the house. Everything's on the floor, it's all been
     smashed, it's all been ripped apart. Gone is the beauti-
     ful apartment that had been so lovingly decorated. In
     its place, utter devastation and shambles.
     Peter stands there speechless for a moment, then an awful
     thought crosses his mind. He runs like crazy into his
     room -- the basket's not there. Stepping over the debris
     and all the things strewn over the floor, he rushes into
     the living room, then into Michael's room. The basket's
     nowhere to be seen.
     Peter falls apart; without even realizing it, he's moan-
     ing and muttering distractedly. He runs into Jack's
     room, into the kitchen, into the bathroom. The basket is
     nowhere to be seen. Peter runs all over, back and forth
     ten times in all the rooms. Tears are flowing from his
     eyes.
     Suddenly, he hears FAINT CRIES.   They're coming from the
     back bathroom. Peter rushes to   it, practically ripping
     the door from its hinges. There   on the toilet is the
     basket, and on it there's a note  written in big messy
     printing which says: "NEXT TIME   WE TAKE HER."
     Mary looks at Peter and smiles; she seems in great shape.
     A distraught Peter picks her up, hugs her tightly and
     kisses her all over as he takes her into his room.
     Just then, Michael appears in the corridor, silent and

     overwhelmed. He comes to the door to Peter's    room and
     looks at him. Peter, mortified to have been    caught
     kissing Mary, hastily distances himself from   her, hold-
     ing her at arm's length. He puts her down on    his bed
     and exits the room.

</b>     The debris has been shoved up against the walls. Peter
     and Michael, in their pajamas and dead tired, are slumped
     over the table. Peter is giving Mary her bottle.
     Michael is looking at Mary as though he were seeing her
     for the first time.

</b>     Peter is in bed, completely out of it.
     Michael is changing Mary very carefully. He puts one
     diaper on her, then the second one, full of dope. He
     lays Mary down in her basket, then places the basket on
     the bed, nestled between the wall and Peter's body.
     Michael, holding the soiled diaper, silently goes out.
     Once he's alone, Peter leans over the basket. Mary and
     he stare at each other intently and seriously. Peter
     switches off the light.

     Michael, asleep on his mattress on the    floor in the
     middle of his wrecked bedroom, emerges    from sleep and
     glances at his clock: it's 6:10 AM.      He staggers to the
     front door and opens it. The door is     being held together
     with a string.
     Agents #1, #2, and #3 are at the door, with four other
     cops backing them up.
     Mrs. Razzolini is standing behind them and staring, wide-
     eyed, a look of horror on her face.

               looking for the dope and that they
               probably didn't find it. So that
               means we've still got it.

               it is. I'll go downstairs. You

</b>     Michael is peeking out at the street from the window
     above. Peter comes out of the building and turns left,
     walking very quickly.
     Suddenly, Peter stops, turns     around and retraces his
     steps. We can clearly see a      man, who was walking about
     six yards behind Peter on the     opposite side of the
     street, also turn around and     retrace his steps.
     It is Graton.

     groceries. Suddenly, a guy walks up to him and elbows
     him sharply.

</b>               And we want to give it to you.
               But the cops are tailing us
               nonstop. Matter of fact, there's
               one right behind us now...

               out a way to shake 'em. Either we
               safely get the dope tomorrow, or
               you, your friend and the kid'll
               get this.

                       the grocery bags
                       three times)
               We'll call you tonight.
     He runs off, disappearing into the darkness. From the
     slit-open grocery bag milk flows out onto the sidewalk.
     Michael is shaking all over. Standing about twenty yards
     away, Graton hasn't missed a thing.

               Never mind about that. Look, Jack,
               you got us into this mess, and
               you're going to help us get out of

               were you, I'd watch what I said
               about her... because she just so

     MARY, wearing a bonnet and coat, is lying on one of the
     couches, CHIRPING merrily. Next  to her, also in his
     coat, Michael is just finishing wrapping a brown package
     which he puts in a plastic bag, along with a book, a
     baby rattle, and a clean diaper.
     Peter and Jack, disguised as punks, each with punk
     hairstyles and wearing black sunglasses, are climbing
     out the window leading to the fire escape.

     woolen blanket, is in his arms. Michael is also carry-
     ing his plastic bag.
     Graton, in his car, is speaking into the radio mike.

</b>               Okay, he's coming out alone.
               I'll follow him. Someone else

</b>     Michael is lying on the grass near the fountain with
     Mary on her blanket near him.
     Graton is nearby, also lying casually on the grass,
     watching them out of the corner of his eye.
     Michael glances at his watch, then at the passersby.
     The punk from the day before walks by with his arm around
     a girl. He strolls by casually. He spots Michael and
     their eyes meet. The couple sit down on a bench a few
     yards away and they begin "making out."

Michael leans over Mary, coochie-coos her and surrepti-
tiously takes off her diaper, which he puts down beside
him. He puts the clean diaper on her.
Graton, nervous and wary,   watches Michael and the
passersby. Just then, two    punks (Peter and Jack) come
running up to Michael. He    ostensibly takes the brown
package out of his plastic   bag and gives it to them.
The two punks immediately take off with the package.
Graton leaps up, shouts "let's get 'em" and takes off
after the punks, followed by about 10 other plainclothes
detectives, who'd been hiding all around.
Michael quickly gets up,    picks Mary up and discreetly
deposits the dope-filled    diaper in a trash can, giving
the punk on the bench an    intent look. Then he goes off
in the direction of the    cops.
The punk calmly goes over to the trash can, takes out the
diaper, which he stuffs into his girl friend's purse, and
goes off in the opposite direction.
The cops have meanwhile arrested Peter and Jack, who put
up no resistance whatsoever. Michael now joins them.

          you admit you gave these men this
          package?
<b>                       MICHAEL
</b>          Sure. I gave it to them, just a

</b>                 (to one of the cops)
          Officer, will you please open this
          package in front of these witnesses?
The cop opens the package: it's a box of chocolate
Easter bunnies. Graton is mortified. He crushes all
the bunnies -- there's absolutely nothing but chocolate
inside them.
<b>                        MICHAEL
</b>          Is it against the law to give a

               Holy shit! The diaper!
     Graton starts running like crazy back to the fountain.
     He rummages like a sick dog all around the spot where
     Michael had been lying. Suddenly he dashes toward the
     trash can and dumps out its contents, throwing the
     garbage around like a lunatic.

</b>     In the devastated living room Peter, still disguised as
     a punk, and Michael, both very high, are dancing around
     in circles with each other and laughing. They are
     singing a lullaby at the top of their lungs, and har-
     monizing. Peter is holding Mary close, and Michael,
     holding a near-empty bottle of liquor, staggers over to
     him and starts turning around in circles with him.
     MARY, snuggled up warmly between Peter and Michael, is
     LAUGHING her head off.
     In the b.g., in the hall, Jack, also still in his punk
     getup, is on the phone. He's got a glass in his hand

     is sitting on a bench. When he sees Jack, he gets up
     and comes to greet him, smiling and extending his hand.
     Without warning, Jack suddenly jumps him and  sends him
     with a forceful shove flying into the water.   Paul lands
     on his back with a big splash, and comes back  up to the
     surface totally dumbfounded. Jack leans over   the water
     and yells at him, like a madman, still a bit  drunk.

<b>              MRS. BRETSAWS

with the father?

</b>Well, listen, Mrs. Fretsaw, umm...
Brainsore...

</b>Bretsaws, Mrs. Bretsaws.
<b>              PETER
</b>Right... Bratsnot, lemme tell
you something. With a child you
always know who the mother is,
but the father -- that's another
kettle of fish. So don't give me
that bullshit, okay?
<b>              MRS. BRETSAWS
</b>Very well. I won't discuss it any
further with you. Will you please
show me where the kitchen and the
bathroom are?
<b>               PETER
</b>What for?
<b>              MRS. BRETSAWS
</b>So I can make you a list of the
things we need.

</b>What do you mean, make you a list?
-- Don't you do the shopping
yourself?
<b>              MRS. BRETSAWS
</b>No shopping or laundry or
housekeeping. I am a professional
nanny.
<b>              PETER
</b>We have plenty of everything.
<b>              MRS. BRETSAWS
</b>Do you have a sufficient amount
of fruit and vegetables for the
child?
<b>              PETER
</b>She only eats milk and cereal.

</b>
<b>              MRS. BRETSAWS
</b>That's not enough, sir. From
the age of three months children
should be started on a normal,
varied diet.

<b>              PETER
</b>Oh that's bullshit. You don't
feed a baby like an adult.

</b>       (mockingly)
Oh, really? And how would you
know?
<b>              PETER
</b>I've read plenty of books. The
diet recommended by those quack
pediatricians today is way too
rich. I'm in favor of natural
methods, Mrs. Breathmint.
<b>              MRS. BRETSAWS
</b>Bretsaws, Mrs. Bretsaws.
<b>              PETER
</b>For instance, if a child is having
trouble getting to sleep, what
would you do?
<b>              MRS. BRETSAWS
</b>Depends, if it was a continuing
problem, I might recommend a
mild sedative...

I knew you'd say something like
that, you jerk!

</b>Fine. Anything you     say, sir.
Let me just remind    you that I have
my diploma and that    medicine is
a serious matter.
<b>              PETER
</b>Do you know the song that goes
'Medicine's a whore and the
pharmacist is her pimp'?
<b>              MRS. BRETSAWS
</b>No, I don't. We must listen to

very fond of opera.

                speak to us ever since the whole
                business with the cops -- we don't
                want to involve any of our
                girlfriends; Sylvia's taking it

                way she's gonna come back now
                that Michael went and told her
                everything's just fine and dandy.
                Peter did a terrific job getting
                rid of Mrs. Bretsaws, and all
                that's left are the daycare
                centers, but Peter's positive
                they're a breeding pit for A.I.D.S.
                So you tell me: What are we
                suppose to do? You want me to

</b>Look,  her mother'll be back in

<b>              JACK
</b>What do you mean, organized?
<b>              PETER
</b>Well, you'll have to ask to fly
the New York-Washington shuttle
for five months, on account of
serious personal problems.
<b>              JACK
</b>What? Never! I'd rather be a
subway conductor.
<b>              PETER
</b>       (barking)
Then dump her in an orphanage,
'cause there's no way we're gonna
take care of her all by ourselves
anymore!
<b>              MICHAEL
</b>Come on, stop arguing, you two!
Jack, you're going to have to
ask to do the New York-Washington

No!   Never.

</b>       (unruffled)
That way, you can do the 6-10 A.M.
shift. That amounts to two bottles
and two diaper changes. You do
the shopping when you get home in
the evening and that's all. Peter,
you'll take the 6-10 P.M. shift.
That's two bottles and two diaper
changes, her bath and her laundry.
Since I work at home I'll take
the longest shift from 10 A.M. to
6 P.M. I'll take her to the park
for an hour, but that's it. No

      kisses her forehead. Mary smiles in her sleep.

      Mary's laughter and Michael's coochie-coo's.
      Noiselessly he tiptoes over to the living room door and
      listens, troubled. Then he walks away and shouts, as
      though he were just coming out of his room.

      Peter carefully locks the door behind him. He removes
      Mary's towel and sits her in her little tub, filled
      with warm water.
      Mary quivers as she comes in contact with the water.
      Peter kneels down and very gently pours glasses of water
      on her shoulders and head. The water streams down her
      face. She blinks and laughs. Peter whispers lovingly

      one-year-old, with a lot more hair on her head, and
      able to sit up a lot better.

</b>      Although it is dark, we can distinguish in Jack's bed
      a rather bulky shape, which is moving around under the
      comforter and doesn't exactly seem to be sleeping...
      Suddenly, from the direction of    the living room, we can
      hear MARY CRYING. Jack emerges     from under the comforter
      and switches on the light: he     has a female guest in
      his bed, a pretty BRUNETTE this    time.
<b>                               JACK

</b>                 What?
<b>                               JACK
</b>                 Nothing, nothing. I'll be right
                 back.
      He gets up, slips on a bathrobe and goes out of the
      bedroom, carefully closing the door behind him. He
      goes into the living room, picks Mary up, and showers
      her with kisses.
      Mary stops crying immediately and lays her head on
      Jack's shoulder, sucking her thumb. Jack rocks her
      for a moment then puts her back to bed.
      Mary instantly starts crying again. Jack very quickly
      picks her up again and kisses her. Mary is delighted
      by his tenderness. Jack puts her back to bed again.

      Mary cries again.

      Mary keeps crying, Jack picks her up again. Peter and
      Michael in their pajamas, their faces swollen with
      sleep, enter the living room.

</b>                       (hushed voice)
                Maybe she's thirsty?
<b>                              PETER
</b>                No, her back teeth must be
                starting to bother her...

</b>                I've bought some stuff for her

      He rubs some of the medication on Mary's gums.

</b>                Try and put her back to bed;
                we'll sing.
      Jack puts Mary back to bed. Michael, as a routine,
      sings a major chord, giving each of them their notes.
      They start singing a lullabye in three-part harmony,
      as they lean over the crib. Mary is in seventh heaven.
      She looks up at them, she stops crying, she sucks her
      thumb.

Peter and Michael stare at her, scandalized. Jack
gestures wildly to her to shut up and go away.

Meanwhile, the Brunette has put her clothes back on and
gathered up her belongings. Now she enters the kitchen.

      CLASSICAL MUSIC, a very fancy table, candles: they're
      at the tail-end of the dinner, before dessert. Everyone
      is very fashionably dressed.

      Natalie is sitting between Peter and Carl. Jay and
      Jerry, Peter's partners, are also there with their wives.
      Michael and Sophia are having a vehement discussion as
      usual, Jack is between two gorgeous models: CHRISTIE
      and CAROLINE.

          Don't cry, Mary, don't cry...
<b>                        PETER
</b>          There's too much noise.
He shuts the MUSIC OFF.   MARY keeps on SCREAMING.

</b>                  (to everyone)
          She's teething, that's why she's
          cranky.
                  (to Jack)
          Give her to me, I'll try and calm
          her down.
Peter takes MARY on his lap.    The SCREAMING CONTINUES.
<b>                        MICHAEL
</b>                 (very tense)
          Don't sit down -- it'll get worse.
          You have to walk around.
Peter gets up and walks around.      Jack and Michael,
standing, watch him walk.
MARY SCREAMS even LOUDER as Peter walks back and forth
in the room with her. The guests watch in uncomfortable
silence.

<b>                        MICHAEL

          You'd never think something so

MARY'S CRYING fills the room.

</b>Gosh, my ears are ringing, I

</b>What?

<b>              CARL
</b>       (loudly)
We were just saying that this
baby's conversation is actually
rather limited... and a touch
annoying. Don't you think?
<b>              PETER
</b>Well, she's not the only one
with a limited conversation.
At least she has an excuse, she's
a baby! What's yours?
<b>              CARL
</b>I frankly don't know what you
mean.
<b>              PETER
</b>I mean, I've been listening to
your pompous drivel about the
latest trends for the last two
hours, and frankly, it's a crock
of horseshit.

          grown!
Recovering, wiping away her tears, she walks over to the
playpen.
<b>                        SYLVIA
</b>          Hello, Mary, hello my darling...
She picks her up, hugs her tightly, showers kisses on
her. MARY LAUGHS. Sylvia starts crying again.
<b>                        SYLVIA
</b>          How beautiful she is... Her hair
          has grown... Look how much she
          changed, I missed it all. I
          missed her so much!
Peter, in a kind of daze, stares at Sylvia. Without
looking at Peter, she dries her eyes and tries to stop
crying.

      He exits like a sleepwalker and goes straight into
      Michael's room. The latter is asleep.

      Peter sits down on the edge of Michael's bed and gently
      shakes him.

      all her stuff into a bag -- bottles, nipples, cereals,

      In the doorway Sylvia, with reddened eyes, silently
      watches them.

          Okay, you can have ours.
He stuffs the blender into the bag.
Mary has now finished her bottle.

<b>                        PETER
</b>          No, I have to burp her first.
With dexterity, he places Mary face down on his shoulder
and walks around in the kitchen, patting her on the back.

          Here, could you give these to

He hands two bibs to Sylvia.
Sylvia walks through the apartment, and stops in front
of Michael's room, where she looks strangely at the
changing table with its mattress, its pretty sheet, and
the baby's toilet articles.
Sylvia enters the living room.
Michael has spread all of Mary's clothes, neatly folded
and ironed on the couch. He is packing them in a big
bag.
<b>                        SYLVIA

          Yeah, sure...
Michael bustles about. Sylvia's gaze comes to rest on
the crib which stands imposingly in the middle of the
living room. Music boxes, little booties and stuffed
animals are hanging from the bars, and a pretty white
tulle frames the crib.

</b>      A taxi is there. Behind the    wheel the driver sits
      waiting. Sylvia is sitting    in the back, on the side
      nearest the sidewalk, and on   her lap is Mary, whom
      she's gently fondling.
      On the sidewalk, beside the   open trunk of the cab,

      Peter is attempting to pack it all in the trunk.    Michael
      is handing the things to him.

      Jack is standing beside the back door of the cab, leaning
      over toward Sylvia, who is holding Mary. He is trying
      unsuccessfully to sound angry.

      Michael enters a fancy building on 5th Avenue.   He's
      carrying a big portfolio and is full of beans.
      In the lobby, he pushes the button for the elevator and
      looks around absentmindedly.

      His gaze suddenly freezes on something.
      By the guard's desk he notices a stroller. Inside, look-
      ing pretty bored, is MARY. Michael is overwhelmed.
      He walks toward Mary and through the sea of people --
      they exchange an intense look.
      He looks around and suddenly sees Sylvia and two men
      deep in discussion coming out of an elevator. Michael,
      startled, runs and hides behind one of the elevators,
      staring out wide-eyed.
      Sylvia is dressed in a very chic, tight black suit, with
      a veiled little black hat and spiked heels. One of the
      men is carrying a bunch of cameras. They walk out
      toward the front door, and Sylvia suddenly stops. She
      seems to have forgotten something. She kisses them
      goodbye and heads toward the elevator. Once she's out
      of their sight, she turns and waits for them to leave.
      When they're gone for sure, she rushes toward Mary and
      showers her with kisses.

      She wheels the stroller over to the door and quickly
      takes off her high heels, and her hat, and stuffs them
      into a big bag. She takes out a pair of old shoes and
      a comfortable jacket, and slips them on. She removes
      the pins from her hair -- she looks like her normal self
      again.
      She leaves, pushing the stroller out the door.
      Michael stands frozen.

      ment. He's with a few of his colleagues, both men and
      women. They say good night to each other.
      Everyone goes into his or her own room.

      Jack's the last one, he goes into his room alone. His
      smile drops. For a moment he stands there just looking.
      He sits down on the bed: on the pillow is a little
      chocolate Santa Claus with a card that reads "Merry
      Christmas. The Marriott Hotels." Jack contemplates
      it forlornly.

      Michael and Sophia, both in kimonos, are sitting in
      front of the last bits of an elegant midnight supper,
      in Michael's room. The bed in unmade.
      Sophia, a glass of champagne in her hand, is yakking
      away nonstop, like a real motor-mouth.
      Michael, silent, is doodling on a paper napkin.
      His pen is making little squares and circles; the circles
      come together and start looking like a baby lying in a
      crib.
      Sophia is absorbed in her monologue.
      Suddenly Michael realizes what he has drawn. He crumples
      the napkin and throws it in the wastebasket. Sophia
      hasn't noticed anything. Michael is bored stiff.

Jack, alone in his room, with his back to us, is facing
his full-length mirror.
He's looking at himself, with one fist on his hip and
the other hand clutching a half-empty bottle of scotch.
He observes himself and slowly turns around -- we can
now see him in profile. His hair is disheveled, he's
unshaven, and he's put a pillow underneath his sweater.
He's pregnant. He takes a big swig of scotch. The
DOORBELL RINGS. Jack walks away from the mirror. He
staggers dead drunk. But dignified, pregnant.
Jack opens the door. Standing there is Graton holding
a stuffed animal, a rabbit.

with a serious, unruffled expression.

<b>                       JACK
</b>         Sylvia doing okay?
<b>                       YOUNG MAN
</b>         I don't know -- I'm a med student.
         I'm just babysitting. I only met
         her a couple hours ago.
<b>                        JACK
</b>         Oh, I see...
Silence. The Young Man sits down at the table and
immerses himself in his books.
Mary doesn't look up from her pack of cigarettes anymore.
<b>                       JACK
</b>         Listen, on second thought, I
         don't think I'll wait for her.
         Just give her this when she gets
         back, okay? And this is for the
         baby.
Jack hands the bouquet and the rabbit to the Young Man,
who plops them down on a chair.
<b>                       YOUNG MAN
</b>         Sure, no problem.
He immerses himself again in his books.
Jack heads toward the door, then turns around.
<b>                       JACK
</b>         Shouldn't the baby be in bed by
         now?
<b>                       YOUNG MAN
</b>         Yeah... I don't know... When I
         put her to bed she cries so I
         just let her stay up...
<b>                       JACK
</b>         Don't you have any tights to put
         on her legs?
<b>                       YOUNG MAN
</b>         Tights?... Well, it's pretty hot
         in here anyway...

      Jack gets out of there in a hurry.

</b>      Jack, in his pilot's uniform, is sitting on the living
      room couch. Michael is standing before him.
<b>                              MICHAEL
</b>                You want me to call them?

</b>                No, I'm not going anywhere anymore,

                still got time.
<b>                              JACK
</b>                Don't you call anybody.

</b>                But the plane's s'posed to take

                have time to replace you. This
                is serious -- you'll lose your

                your share of the apartment
                anymore... you...
      Jack takes off his pilot's jacket and throws it aside.
<b>                              JACK
</b>                I'll be a dishwasher, I'll live

                and tired of traveling, sick and
                tired of broads. They all have
                the same asses and I can't seem
                to love them anyway. I can't
                take another hotel room, and
                swimming pools and trendy
                restaurants! I want to know

      Michael has no answer to these questions.     He leaves.

</b>      Michael, wearing an apron and holding a wooden spoon,
      goes into Jack's room. The latter, lying on his bed,
      is smoking and staring at the ceiling.
<b>                              MICHAEL
</b>                Come on, I made us a good dinner.
                I bought some filet mignon and
                Haagen-Dazs butter pecan. When
                Peter comes back he'll cheer you
                up...
<b>                              JACK
</b>                He's been here all day.

      Michael heads towards Peter's room.    Jack feebly gets
      up and follows him.
      Michael knocks on the door.     No answer.
<b>                                MICHAEL
</b>                Peter!    Dinner's ready!
      Still no answer. Michael opens the door:      Peter's lying
      face-down on his bed.
      He's holding the rubber giraffe and sobbing. Michael
      and Jack, dismayed, stare at him. Peter hides his face
      in his arm.
      Jack and Michael go to the kitchen and sit down to their
      steaks, totally depressed.

</b>      The DOORBELL RINGS. A bare-chested Michael, in jeans,
      drags himself over to the front door and opens it.
      There stands Sylvia with Mary in her stroller.

</b><b>                                                         136.

Sylvia is a disheveled mess.

</b>          Is Jack here? 'Cause I'm a mess.
          I can't handle it, I'm all alone...

          Jack!   Jack, c'mere for Chrissake!
<b>                        SYLVIA
</b>          'Cause my place is tiny, y'know,
          and my schedule's insane -- and I
          just finished four days of posing
          and we ended up every day at...

Jack, bare-chested, comes in pulling on his jeans. He
stops short at the front door. Sylvia is about to cry.
<b>                        SYLVIA
</b>                 (to Jack)
          Yeah, y'see, Jack, I just did
          four days of posing...
<b>                         JACK
</b>          Yeah...
<b>                        SYLVIA
</b>          And every day we finished at
          three in the morning and since
          Mary always gets up around 5:30...
<b>                         JACK
</b>          Yeah...
<b>                        SYLVIA
</b>          Well, you can imagine how much
          sleep I've gotten...
<b>                        JACK
</b>          Yeah, of course, 'cause after
          the 5:30 bottle it starts all
          over again around nine...
<b>                        SYLVIA
</b>          And by the time I change her
          and play with her a little, it's
          already eight o'clock...

          only an hour of sleep.

<b>                        JACK
</b>          Plus they don't put the kids to

          half-naked...

<b>                        SYLVIA
</b>          Oh, so the flowers and the
          rabbit were from you...

</b>          I could have strangled that guy...
<b>                        SYLVIA
</b>          I mean it, I can't cope anymore.
          My parents and I don't talk to
          each other and anyway they live
          in Texas, and the baby needs to
          get out to the park...
<b>                        MICHAEL
</b>          Yeah, tell me about it! Finding
          time to take her to the park
          every day is a real bitch!
<b>                         SYLVIA
</b>          And I have to work, I need the
          money to survive and anyway I
          love my job...
A distraught Peter, bare-chested and in jeans, comes
running in from his room.
<b>                        SYLVIA
</b>          But to work I've gotta have
          a babysitter, and to have a

                 (she sobs)
          ... and I'm not sure I'm

</b>                 (sobbing)
          It's just 'cause I haven't slept
          in four nights -- she must be
          teething or something, I don't
          know but I can't manage...
<b>                        PETER

         cutting a tooth -- you just have
         to put some stuff on her gums...
<b>                       MICHAEL
</b>         She pulled the same thing on us.
         We lost all our friends in one
         night -- on account of one tooth!
<b>                          SYLVIA
</b>         And just look    at my face!
         Nobody's going    to want me to
         model for them    with the way my
         face looks...    And what'll happen
         to me if they    don't want me
         anymore?

<b>                       MICHAEL
</b>         But you're beautiful -- At your
         age all you need is a good night's
         sleep and you'll look like new.
<b>                       SYLVIA
</b>         Right, a good night's sleep --
         but when?
<b>                       PETER
</b>         Well, why don't you leave the
         baby with us for a few days,
         till you recuperate... I mean,
         if you want.
<b>                       MICHAEL
</b>         We're old pros -- it's not a
         big deal for us...
<b>                       SYLVIA
</b>                (blowing her nose,
                 wiping her eyes)
         Really? I can leave her with
         you for a little while?
<b>                        JACK
</b>         Of course. Leave her with us.
         Come back whenever you want.
         Get some rest.
Sylvia, between two sobs, picks up a big bag beside her
on the doorstep.
<b>                       SYLVIA
</b>         I brought a couple of things
         for her, just for a few days...
Michael eagerly takes the bag from her.    It's followed by
a second, and then a third.
<b>                          PETER
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                           139.
</b>
                (taking Mary
                 in his arms)
         Is she hungry?
<b>                       SYLVIA
</b>         Yeah, it's time for her bottle
         -- it's all ready in the bag...
<b>                       JACK
</b>         I'll go heat up some water right
         away. Would you like a cup of
         coffee?
<b>                       SYLVIA
</b>         Oh, okay, thanks...

Peter, carrying Mary towards the kitchen, is followed by
Jack and Michael with the bags.
Sylvia blows her nose and walks around aimlessly in the
hall.
In the kitchen the three men bustle about with the bags,
the bottle, the saucepan... They've swallowed all their
pride and are kissing Mary all over, on her neck, her
hands, her tummy. They're deliriously happy. Michael
takes some sheets out of the bag.
<b>                       MICHAEL
</b>         I'll go make up her bed!
He exits, and, once in the corridor, prances around,
leaping and dancing... He gets to the living room and
goes over to the crib: suddenly, he recoils and freezes,
a fearful expression on his face. Then he turns and
races back to the kitchen.
<b>                       MICHAEL
</b>                (floored)
         Hey, you guys -- come and see,
         come and see!
<b>                        PETER
</b>         What?
<b>                       MICHAEL
</b>         Come see, I said.
Jack and Peter nervously follow Michael into the living
room. They stop short in front of the crib: There is
Sylvia, curled up in a fetal position, sucking her thumb
and sleeping like an angel.
<b>                       MICHAEL
</b>         The poor thing, she's really
         wiped out.
<b>
</b><b>                                                               140.
</b>
<b>                          JACK
</b>            She'll need two or three months
            to recover, at least... Maybe
            more!
<b>                          PETER
</b>            We could set up a room for her
            here...
<b>                          MICHAEL
</b>            A room for her and a room for
            Mary...
<b>                          JACK
</b>            Then we could have four shifts
            instead of three!

<b>                          PETER
</b>            Yeah, but I don't think she'll
            agree. She's got her own life
            to live.
<b>                          MICHAEL
</b>            Yeah, she probably wouldn't want
            to move here. She'd think we'd
            jump on her any chance we could...
<b>                          JACK
</b>            But we'd make a rule, she'd just
            be 'one of the guys!'
<b>                          MICHAEL
</b>            She'll never want to...
<b>                          SYLVIA
</b>                   (very awake)
            So, I'll take the ten A.M. to three
            P.M. shift... And I'll take every
            other night... plus the walk in
            the park in the afternoon before I
            go to work... and we split the
            rent equally... and I'll just be
            'one of the guys'... deal?
<b>                           PETER, MICHAEL, AND JACK
</b>                    (smiling broadly)
            Deal.
Mary    suddenly comes in from the kitchen, walking unstead-
ily    but determinedly. She's dragging Graton's rabbit by
its    ear. She looks at the four of them and laughs her
head    off.
