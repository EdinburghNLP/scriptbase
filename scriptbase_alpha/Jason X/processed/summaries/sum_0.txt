Set way in the future, Earth is no longer inhabitable, so humans have colonized in outer space.
One colony receives two cryogenically frozen bodies, and when they defrost them, one of the bodies turns out to be.....who else?
Jason Voorhees.
No longer in the forest or Camp Crystal Lake, Jason stalks the colonists in a whole new environment.
