	JASON X
	By Todd Famer

	WE OPEN ON:

	An EYE

	We have seen this eye before, but we can't be sure just
	where.  It stares at us implacably.  Malevolently.  It
	blinks.  Blinks again.  Then closes.  We are in...

	DARKNESS

	The darkness is slowly broken by moving vertical lines.  At
	first we don't realize what we're seeing.  But soon the lines
	resolve themselves into PILLARS.

	We are moving past pillars.  A vast line of them -- cold,
	concrete -- marching away into the distance.

	INTERCUT

	Extreme close-ups reveal bits and pieces of maybe... a
	figure.  We see the hint of a shoe, a link of a chain, a
	scrap of tattered leather... A MASK.  An EYE.  The eye closes
	and again we are in --

	BLACKNESS

	Now we hear FOOTSTEPS.  We go from black to gray as we move
	past the large concrete pillars.  In the distance looms --

	A PEDESTAL

	Rising high off the seeping concrete floor, it is framed by
	pillars on either side -- and lit from above by a single
	shaft of harsh white light.

	Something stands on the pedestal.  Something huge.  But from
	this distance we can't see what it is. 

	Moving with the footsteps, we approach --

	Now we are CLOSE enough to see a massive figure, wrapped in a
	STRAIGHT JACKET and secured by CHAINS to the floor below and
	the ceiling above.  He is immobile, imprisoned -- chained
	like an animal.

	As we get closer, we recognize this figure.  His massive
	limbs...his MASK.

	A HOCKEY MASK!

	And behind the mask: the eyes.  The left eye is gone.  Long
	ago gouged out and scarred over.  But the right eye stares
	with dark, brooding fury.

	JASON VORHEES

	He lives.

	An IV is plugged into his neck, a steady drip of tranquilizer
	coming from a HANGING CLEAR BAG.

	A young woman enters with a plate of brownies.  Let's call
	her TRACEY.  She stops and stares at Jason for a moment until
	a voice causes her to jump slightly.

					JOHNSON (O.S.)
			Creepy, huh?

	Tracey turns to see JOHNSON, a young soldier posted behind
	the 50 Cal.

					TRACEY
			What?

					JOHNSON
			I said it's creepy -- the way he keeps
			staring out like that.

					TRACEY
			Creepy.

					JOHNSON
			You know you're not supposed to be in
			here.

					TRACEY
			I know.  I just thought you'd like some
			company.

					JOHNSON
			Love some.  But Rowan would shit
			kittens.

					TRACEY
			I've got brownies.

					JOHNSON
			Double-fudge?

					TRACEY
			With nuts...just the way you like 'em.

	Tracey offers up the plate and Johnson grabs a couple,
	wolfing them down.  Tracey sets the plate down, turns to
	Johnson and reaching into her (blouse?) pulls out a camera.

					JOHNSON
				(mouth full)
			Oh no... no way.

					TRACEY
			Come on... you promised.

					JOHNSON
			Are you kidding?  If Rowan finds out
			we'll both get pink slips.

					TRACEY
			Just a couple of quick shots...
				(unbuttons blouse)
			...something kinky?

	Johnson grins, mouth full of brownies, heart full of light.

							   CUT TO:

	FLASH

	Johnson is snapping photos of Tracey posing with Jason.  She
	mock kisses him, grabs Jason's crotch...kid stuff.  It pulls
	slightly from Jason's neck, nearly comes out.  Neither takes
	notice.  Then --

	ROWAN ENTERS

					ROWAN
			Just what in the hell do you think
			you're doing?

	Johnson and Tracey compose themselves quickly.

					JOHNSON
			Sorry, doc.  We were just goofing
			around.

					ROWAN
			Goofing around.  That's exactly what got
			167 people killed.

	Tracey grabs her plate of brownies and dashes out.

					ROWAN (CONT'D)
				(continuing; to Johnson)
			I'm going to put you on report for this,
			Johnson.

					JOHNSON
			I'm on report.  Look, we weren't hurting
			anything. 
			You've been pumping him full of drugs
			for two years.  The guy's harmless. 
			What can he do?

					ROWAN
			You better hope you don't find out.  Now
			get back behind that weapon and keep
			your eyes on him at all times.

					JOHNSON
			Yes, sir.  Er, ma'am.

	Johnson gets back behind the 50 as Rowan stares at Jason for
	a moment.  Everything looks in order.  She exits.

	Johnson stares at Jason for a few moments then goes and
	throws a sheet over his head.  It doesn't weigh much but its
	enough to pull the IV from Jason's neck.

	Johnson doesn't notice.

					JOHNSON (CONT'D)
				(continuing)
			Stare at that, you ugly son-of-a bitch.

	EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - DAWN

	We see a nondescript sign that reads: CRYSTAL LAKE RESEARCH
	FACILITY.  In the distance is a small concrete building. 
	Something about its structure suggests that it leads
	underground.

	A military personnel truck stops at the concrete building. 
	Soldiers jump out of the back and disappear into the
	building.

	INT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR - MORNING

	Dr. Wimmer moves with the soldiers towards Jason's room when
	Rowan comes up.

					ROWAN
			What are you doing here?

					DR. WIMMER
			What do you think -- I'm taking the
			specimen.

					ROWAN
			But you can't.  I haven't prepared the
			cryostasis chamber yet.

					DR. WIMMER
			I don't want him frozen, Doctor.  I want
			him alive.

					ROWAN
			We've already discusses this.

					DR. WIMMER
			Yes, well, I went over your head.  I
			have the Army's permission to remove the
			specimen to our Scranton Facility.

					ROWAN
			But Dr. Wimmer you can't risk
			transporting him through open country.

					DR. WIMMER
			You have to see the bigger picture here.

					ROWAN
			I've seen it, or should I remind you of
			the last time you tried to move him?

					DR. WIMMER
			We've come a long way since then.

					ROWAN
			I'm telling you...

					DR. WIMMER
			Look, this isn't open for discussion. 
			His unique ability to regenerate lost
			and damaged tissue, even to defy death
			simply calls for more research.

					ROWAN
			You're willing to risk the deaths of
			innocent civilians if he escapes.

					DR. WIMMER
			No one is truly innocent, besides, I'm
			sure Sgt. Mazur and his men can handle
			the transfer.  Right, Sgt.?

					SGT. MAZUR
			Don't worry, ma'am.  He so much as
			twitches, I'll blow him right into
			Tomorrow-morrow land.

					DR. WIMMER
			Dr. Wimmer, please...

					DR. WIMMER (CONT'D)
			You've done good work on this project,
			Rowan, but you are no longer needed
			here.
				(to Mazur)
			Sergeant?

					SGT. MAZUR
				(to his men)
			Let's move him out.

					ROWAN
			But...

	As they brush past Rowan and she's powerless to stop them.

	INT. HOLDING CELL - MOMENTS LATER

	Once again, we're in the cavernous room line with pillars. 
	Mazur and his men move quickly to surround Jason' pedestal.

	No one speaks.  Doctor Wimmer's upper lip is slick with
	sweat.  The men close in around the STILL-SHROUDED JASON. 
	Some have CATTLE PRODS.  Others carry noose polls with slip
	knots on the end.  Still, others hold BILLY CLUBS at the
	ready.  And all of them carry HOLSTERED SIDEARMS.

	They stand there, waiting for the word from Mazur, who goes
	to the pillbox and raps on the wall near the snout of the
	machine gun.

					SGT. MAZUR
			Careful with that 50, soldier.  You've
			got friendlies out here.

	Mazur then circles Jason cautiously.

					DR. WIMMER
				(agitated)
			What are you waiting for?

					SGT. MAZUR
			Just takin' my time, doc.  I only want
			to have to do this once.
				(to his men)
			All right, boys.  Let's knock him out.

	Three men with CATTLE PRODS move in and administer a
	methodical SERIES OF JOLTS through the shroud.

	The shrouded figure twitches violently, then falls still. 
	After a moment, the black shroud falls off and slips silently
	away.  Mazur and Wimmer react with horror!

					SGT. MAZUR (CONT'D)
			What the Christ?

					DR. WIMMER
			It can't be!

	But it is.

	JOHNSON

	One of the chains is cinched around his neck.  His face is
	ghostly blue.  He couldn't be more dead.  Grim realization
	dawns on Sgt. Mazur who spins around wildly, frantic eyes
	searching.  Then finding...

	JASON

	emerging from the pillbox.  His straight jacket is split open
	at the seams.  Broken chains hang off his wrists and drag
	behind his legs.  He stands firm, the massive 50 in hand as
	if he were about to mow them all down.

					SGT. MAZUR
			Oh, shit.

	Suddenly, Jason swings the massive gun, CRACKING a nearby
	soldier's skull. 

	The remaining men OPEN FIRE, peppering Jason with ordinance,
	but this only seems to infuriate him.  Jason grabs a nearby
	soldier and holds him up like a shield just as --

	Another soldier FIRES.  Riddling the captive soldier with
	bullets.  Dropping the dead soldier, Jason windmills both
	arms, WHIPPING THE CHAINS over his head.  One length of chain
	wraps around a soldier's neck.  The other hits the side of
	Sgt. Mazur's head.

	A soldier runs at Jason with a NOOSE POLE and tries to put
	the NOOSE around his neck.  Jason grabs a POLE and smashes
	the soldier across the forehead.  The soldier at the end of
	the chain tries to run.  Jason JERKS the chain, snapping the
	soldier's neck and pulls him off his feet.

	Dr. Wimmer turns to run, but he only gets a step before Jason
	throws the NOOSE POLE and spears Dr. Wimmer through the
	chest.  He falls to his knees and forward.  The tip of the
	pole hits the floor.  Holding the Doctor up as he dies.

	Soon no one is left alive except Sgt. Mazur, who struggles to
	stand, shotgun in hand.  Jason closes in.  Mazur fires point
	blank.  To no effect.

	Jason moves toward him.  Mazur disappears behind a pillar. 
	Jason moves off down the line of pillars, heading for an
	exit.

	INT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

	Mayhem hasn't reached this hallway yet.  It remains tranquil
	and quiet as Rowan walks along, carrying a cardboard box
	stenciled on the side "DESTROY".

	Suddenly, a SOLDIER runs past.

					ROWAN
			Hey, what's the...?

	But the soldier is GONE.  Then another runs by.

					ROWAN (CONT'D)
			Oh shit.

	Suddenly, BOOM!  A third running soldier accidentally
	FLATTENS ROWAN.

	The box goes flying, scattering JASONIANA all over the
	hallway: blood-encrusted work gloves, newspaper clippings. 
	We watch one ARTIFACT go skittering across the floor.

	JASON'S MACHETE

	The soldiers disappear through a door.  Sounds of GUN FIRE
	and SCREAMS echo through the hall.  Rowan struggles to her
	feet and moves slowly down the hall towards the door.

	WHAM! 

	The door flies off its hinges as Sgt. Mazur lands nearby. 
	Rowan, blood pouring from his mouth, kneels beside him.

					SGT. MAZUR
			Get out of here!  Get out now!

					ROWAN
			What's happened?

					SGT. MAZUR
			He's escaped!

					ROWAN
			Damnit, Wimmer!

	The Sgt. dies in her arms.  She takes his shotgun, locks and
	loads, and moves off down the dark hallway.

			JASON VORHEES

	comes into the corridor, filling it with his bulk, back-lit
	and ominous.

	Jason picks up his old MACHETE.  It fits in his hand like an
	old friend.  He moves past the dead Sergeant.

	INT. STAIRS SUBTERRANEAN - LATER

	ON ROWAN

	Steel steps ring with her footsteps as Rowan pounds down the
	stairs.  She shivers with the cold as she looks for a place
	to hide among the huge tanks and gothic-looking ducts and
	pipes.

	Jason moves down the stairs into the subterranean lair.

	ON ROWAN

	She crouches in the dark, shotgun cradled in her arms.  She
	spots a large STEEL DOOR and moves to it.

	INT. CRYO LAB - CONTINUOUS

	Rowan darts behind a RACK OF GAS CANISTERS.  Jason enters,
	his machete ready.  In one corner, the door to a boxy, cell
	like chamber.  THE CRYO UNIT.  Stands open.  There's no sign
	of the girl.

	Jason looks around, seeking his prey.  Suddenly, Rowan STEPS
	OUT OF HIDING, shotgun at the ready.  

	KABLAM!

	The point-blank blast nails Jason in the back and drives him
	forward.  He spins as...

	KABLAM!

	He's hit in the knee.  He stumbles but doesn't fall.  

	KABLAM!

	Jason is hit in the shoulder.  But doesn't fall.

	This isn't working.  Thus Rowan glances to a ROLLING RACK OF
	GAS CANISTERS beside her.  USING her foot, she shoves the
	rack,

	The wheels squeak as it rolls forward finally stopping at
	Jason's feet.  Jason looks at the rack like "You gotta be
	kidding me..."  He looks back to:

	Rowan, who just grins and lowers her shotgun.  She fires at
	the canisters.

	KABOOM!

	The canister's pressurized contents explode, sending Jason
	falling into the Cryo Chamber.  Rowan dives for cover.

	Hurling herself across the cryo lab, Rowan slams shut the
	Cryo Unit door.  And Jason is trapped inside.

					COMPUTER VOICE (O.S.)
			Cryo Unit sealed.  Please initiate
			activation sequence.

	Jason BASHES AWAY at the Cryo Unit door.

					COMPUTER VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
			Please initial --

	Rowan SLAMS her FIST against the initiate button.

					COMPUTER VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
			Cryo Unit activated.

	Lights glow.  Engines HUM to life.

	THROUGH CRYO UNIT WINDOW

	We hear a sibilant HISS as CRYO GAS cascades over Jason.  His
	movements slow as the coldness sets into his flesh.

	Slowly the hiss dies away as the unit goes silent and still. 
	Rowan breaths a sigh of relief.  She sags against the door. 
	Then --

	THE MACHETE

	BURSTS through the steel door and into Rowan's gut.  ALARMS
	SOUND.

					COMPUTER VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
			Cryo Unit Breach.  Lock-down in
			progress.

					ROWAN
			No!
			She places her hands on the Cryo Unit
			and shoves herself off the machete
			blade.  She screams in pain and staggers
			toward the closing door.

	She grabs the edges of the door, but it swings inexorably
	closed.  She yanks her fingers away at the last second before
	they're pulverized by the closing door.  Massive pressure
	bolts suss the door shut.

					ROWAN (CONT'D)
			No!

	She jerks on the door.  It won't budge.

					ROWAN (CONT'D)
			Somebody!  No!

	CHSSHSHSHSHSSH...

	Gash filters into the room from the leak in the Cryo Unit. 
	Rowan begins to fade.  She stumbles backward against a wall
	and falls to her knees.

					ROWAN (CONT'D)
			NO!  Please!

	As the CRYO GAS washes over her, Rowan passes out.  

	CLOSE ON

	Her face as ice crystals form.

	TABLEAU

	Rowan, frozen on the floor, and Jason, motionless behind the
	Cryo Unit Door.

	We move slowly over the scene, languidly drinking it in. 
	From Rowan...to Jason...back to Rowan...

								FADE TO BLACK.

			FADE IN:

	INT. SUBTERRANEAN LAIR - 445 YEARS LATER

	PITCH BLACK.  A light slices through the darkness.  Then
	another.  Illuminating the stale air.

	Cloaked figures, holding lights, move down the concrete steps
	and into the dusty space below.

	They reach the LARGE STEEL DOOR.  Ice has crusted over the
	window in the door.

	INT. CYRO LAB

	A thick layer of ice and frost covers the floor and ceiling. 
	Through the door we can see lights on the other side of the
	frozen door.  

	Now we hear a HUMMING sound followed by TURNING GEARS.  Then
	the sound of CRACKING ICE as the metallic door opens.

					LOWE (O.S.)
			Everyone stay put...Kay-em.

	The mixture of warm and cold air creates a THICK FOG. 
	Through the fog steps a BEAUTIFUL FEMALE (19-22).  We notice
	that her movements are fluid, perfect and precise.  Almost
	too precise.

	This is KAY-EM 14, and as time goes on, we realize that she's
	a science droid.

	She casually glances around the room, sniffs the air, then
	speaks in a warm contralto that is, like her movements,
	almost too exact.

					KAY-EM 14
			No viruses, no bacteria, no toxins. 
			It's clean.

	KICKER (30), a big, no-nonsense military man, enters and
	scans the area.  PROFESSOR LOWE (35) enters behind him.

	Both men wear strange dusters with collars wrapped around
	their faces.  Lowe opens his duster and lowers his goggles.

					LOWE
				(awe-stricken)
			Amazing.  It's still cold.

	Three new figures enter the room.  As they remove their
	goggles we realize they're just kids.

	JANESSA (18) pushes past him impatiently.  She's a hottie and
	she knows it.  She looks around with disgust.

	TSUNARON (19), a genius on the cusp of insanity.

	AZRAEL (17), looks around excitedly.

					AZRAEL
			Awesome, this is the real deal, isn't
			it?

					LOWE
			It certainly is.  Someone tell me what
			you make of that?

	He motions toward the cryo-cell and can hardly contain his
	excitement.

					AZRAEL
			Some kind of storage container.

					TSUNARON
			Probably a cryostasis unit.  I'd guess
			an early Port series.  Kay-Em?

					KAY-EM 14
			Z-port Eleven.  Manufactured around
			twenty-ten.  Precise historic records
			are inconsistent.

	As they stare at the massive cryo-unit.

					TSUNARON
			Is anyone thinking what I'm thinking?

	They stare at one another with excitement.

					LOWE
			Kicker, open it up.

	Kicker approaches the cryo unit slowly, cautiously.  He scans
	it for a moment.  Then hits the door release button.

	CHSSHSHSHSHSHS - a cold fog rolls out of the unit as Kicker
	slowly swings the door open.  As the fog dissipates, Jason's
	frozen body becomes more clear.  He stands motionless, his
	machete raised at shoulder height.

					JANESSA
			What the hell is that?

					LOWE
			My god, he's a monster.  Who can tell me
			what he's wearing on his face?

					JANESSA
			Some kind of 20th century carbon
			filtration unit?

					TSUNARON
			No, it's a hockey mask.

					LOWE
			Very good, Tsun.

					JANESSA
			What's a hockey mask?

					KAY-EM 14
			Facial armor used in a sport outlawed in
			twenty-twenty four.

					LOWE
			Amazing.  Absolute museum quality.  We
			are looking at the find of the century,
			here.
				(shakes his head in disbelief)

					JANESSA
			Kids?

					LOWE
			Azrael, are you paying attention?

	ON AZRAEL

	Who's wandering around the room.

					AZRAEL
			Not really.

					LOWE
			Don't touch anything.

	Oops.  He's already picked up a metallic cup.  He tries to
	set it down without being seen.  But it's so cold that it
	sticks to his fingers.  He tries to shake it free.  No good.

					LOWE (CONT'D)
				(re: Jason)
			Let's get him back to the ship.

					TSUNARON (O.S.)
			Uh, guys...

	They turn to Tsunaron.

					TSUNARON (CONT'D)
			There's a body over here.

	They shine their lights at his feet revealing Rowan, frozen
	and curled into a ball.  Azrael moves toward the cryo-unit as
	the others gather around Rowan.

					LOWE
			Kay-Em?

	Kay-Em examines Rowan closely.

					KAY-EM 14
			She's perfectly preserved.  Cell
			crystallization is at 25 percent.

					LOWE
			25 percent?

					KAY-EM 14
			Suggest extensive nano-tech and phase
			one cell reconstruction.  Chances of
			resuscitation are one in five.

					LOWE
			That's incredible.

					JANESSA
			Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're saying we could
			bring her back to life?

					KAY-EM 14
			Precisely, but she is deteriorating. 
			Opening the door has compromised her
			hibernation.

					LOWE
				(into radio)
			Lou, get ready for dust off.  We have a
			priority evac.

					FAT LOU (O.S.)
			Copy that.  En route in five.

					LOWE
			Not five.  NOW!

	Tsunaron and Janessa prep Rowan's stiff body to move as
	Kicker and Lowe watch over them.

	AZRAEL

	is still trying to remove the frozen cup from his hand.  He
	rakes it across the cryo-cell, then --

	A HUGE CHUNK of ICE drops from the roof of the Cryo Unit and
	SHATTERS at Azrael's feet, scattering shards of ice across
	the frozen floor.

	Now it's Azrael's turn to jump.  Backward.  Right into
	Jason's FROZEN FRAME.

					KICKER
			Look out!

	Jason teeters backward, then FALLS FORWARD.  The Machete
	still cemented to his hand.  Catches Azrael in the shoulder.

	And the momentum takes the kids ARM CLEAN OFF.

	When Jason hits the cold ground, all his chains and shackles
	SHATTER into tiny, brittle bits.

	And the impact jars the machete free from his hand.

	Kay-Em rushes to Azrael, who's staring at the pulsing stump
	of his arm in breathless horror.  She removes a syringe and a
	clear patch from her pack.  She quickly injects him with the
	needle.

					KAY-EM 14
			50 CCs of etherene.  You'll be fine.

					AZRAEL
			Fine?!  I'm missing my fucking --
				(the drug takes hold)
			You're so pretty.

	Kay-Em deftly applies the clear patch to Azreal's shoulder. 
	The patch instantly expands sealing the wound and stopping
	the flow of blood.

	Lowe moves to Jason's body fearing it's been damaged.

					LOWE
				(to Azreal)
			In the future, try not to destroy the
			400 year old artifacts.

	Lowe picks up Jason's machete and slides it into his belt.

					LOWE (CONT'D)
			We're gonna make history here, people.

	EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE RESEARCH FACILITY - WASTELAND - WIDE

	Lowe, Kicker and the kids appear through the rubble where the
	brick building once stood.

	The trees are gone, the lake has dried up.  Acrid DUST DEVILS
	swirl in the dead air.  LIGHTNING CRACKLES overhead in the
	red, scorched sky.

	We follow the group as they struggle to carry the two bodies
	across the wasteland, toward --


	A SHUTTLE

	It hovers and touches down on the cracked land.

	INT. SHUTTLE COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

	FAT LOU, rail-thin pilot (50), sits at the comm, surrounded
	by high-tech displays and controls.

					FAT LOU
				(into mic)
			Kicker, are the doors secure?

					KICKER (O.S.)
			Locked and blocked.

					FAT LOU
			Lift off in three, two...

	EXT. WASTELAND - CONTINUOUS

	Battling the powerful winds, the shuttle lifts off the ground
	and starts into the sky.

	EXT. ORBIT - OLD EARTH - CONTINUOUS

	The shuttle maneuvers through a maze of old space junk.

	INT. SHUTTLE COCKPIT

	Kicker enters the cockpit.

					FAT LOU
			What did you find?

					KICKER
			You won't believe it.  Get the Sarge on
			the horn.

	INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS

	Within the bay we see the EX-GRUNT TEAM.  Trained killers
	forced to do manual labor.  CONDOR SHARPENS a massive drill
	bit extending from the MOLE, a massive four-wheeled
	Archaeological vehicle.

	SVEN, a strong, good-looking guy, has cornered GEKO, female,
	deadly.  They should be working on the satellite near them
	but instead they are flirting with one another.  DALLAS and
	BRIGGS move a giant winch hook into position.

					BRIGGS
			You hear?  Division four just entered
			the occupied zone.

					DALLAS
			Casualties?

					BRIGGS
			Minimal.

					DALLAS
			How the hell did we get this screwed up
			assignment?

					BRIGGS
			Amen, bro.  I didn't join the Grunt corp
			to be a friggin' babysitter.

	O.S. a BUZZER begins to sound.  SGT. BRODSKI crosses toward a
	WALL COMM.  Tall, ebony, gleaming bald head.  From the look
	in his eyes we can tell he's seen some shit in his time.  And
	dealt some out, too.

					BRODSKI
				(into mic)
			Brodski, here.

					KICKER (O.S.)
			We found a viable down here.

					BRODSKI
			Say again?

	The sudden change in Brodski's voice stops the grunts in
	their tracks.  They begin to gather around.

					KICKER (O.S.)
			We found two bodies in deep cryo-stasis. 
			The Kay-Em unit thinks we can
			resuscitate the female.  We're on
			approach now.

					BRODSKI
			Roger that.
				(disconnects)
			Okay, team.  Company's coming.  Let's
			get out the welcome mat.

	The grunts frown and move away.

					CONDOR
			Damn, I thought we might get to kill
			something.

	Brodski flips a switch on his COMM UNIT.

					BRODSKI
			Crutch!  You copy?

	INT. GRENDEL - BRIDGE

	CRUTCH (50), bald, ship's engineer and co-pilot, sleeps in
	the co-pilot's seat.

					BRODSKI (O.S.)
			Crutch!  Do you read?

	Crutch doesn't stir.

					BRODSKI (O.S.) (CONT'D)
			Crutch?  Wake the hell up!

	Crutch opens one eye.

					CRUTCH
			What do you want?

	INT. CARGO BAY

					BRIGGS
				(into COMM UNIT)
			They're on their way back.  Prepare
			docking and power up the labs.

	INT. GRENDEL - BRIDGE

	Crutch shakes his head trying to wake himself up.

					CRUTCH
			Whatever...

	He starts to do his job.

	INT. SHUTTLE COCKPIT

	Fat Lou works the controls as the shuttle approaches GRENDEL.
	Through the front windshield we see -- GRENDEL, a class IV
	Catamaran Transport.  It looks like two huge half-torpedoes
	connected to a middle BRIDGE SECTION by three thin walkways
	on either side.  Not new, but by no means old.

	EXT. GRENDEL - CONTINUOUS

	Beowulf approaches and docks with the much larger Grendel.

	INT. SHUTTLE BAY - CONTINUOUS

	The doors fly open.

					BRODSKI
			Kicker, Briggs, take the girl.  Condor,
			Geko, you got the big guy.

	Briggs joins Kicker on Rowan's stretcher, Dallas and Geko
	lift Jason's as Lowe exits.

					LOWE
			We need to get her to the lab.

	As Rowan's stretcher passes.

					BRODSKI
			Can you bring her back?

					LOWE
			We'll find out, sergeant.

	As Jason's stretcher passes.

					BRODSKI
			You're not bringing him back, are you?

					LOWE
			Impossible.

	ANGLE ON AZRAEL

	Still dopey, he stands at the door to the shuttle.

					AZRAEL
			Oh shit!  I forgot my arm!

					JANESSA
			Here, dumbass.

	She hands him his arm and moves on.

					AZRAEL
			Hi, hand.

	We move into --

	INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS

					BRODSKI
			Any idea how long she's been down?

					KAY-EM 14
			4.55 centuries.

	ON ROWAN'S FROZEN FACE

					BRODSKI
				(if this works)
			This'll be one helluva wake-up call.

					JANESSA
			I'm bitchy as hell when I wake up.

					TSUNARON
			Did you just wake up?

	Janessa glares at him as they move into --

	INT. LAB HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	As our guys move quickly through, we get a swift look at this
	steel cylinder.  It connects the Bridge Section to the labs
	and living spaces in the left pontoon.

					TSUNARON
				(to Kay-Em)
			Once we're in the clear I'd like to
			check your circuits.

					JANESSA
			I bet you would.

					TSUNARON
			It's not like that.

	INT. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE WALKWAY "B"

	The gang enters with the two frozen bodies.

					LOWE
				(to Kinsa)
			Where are the others?

					KINSA
			Waylander's in Lab One.  He's charging
			the bed now.

					LOWE
			Good.  Get Stoney and Adrienne into Lab
			Two.
				(to the Grunts)
			Take the big guy and meet them there. 
			The female goes to Lab One with me.

					KINSA
			Oh, you guys always find the cool shit.

	The grunts carry the stretchers down the hall.

					AZRAEL
			Oh my God.  My arm's not on my body.

					LOWE
			Tsunaron get him fixed in the bed now.

					TSUNARON
			Got it.

	Adrienne enters.

					LOWE
			Adrienne, good.  I need you in Lab Two.

					ADRIENNE
			What's happening?  You found something,
			didn't you?

					LOWE
			Two viables.

					ADRIENNE
				(excited)
			Two?!  My God, in what condition?

					LOWE
			Perfect.  We're attempting reanimation
			on one.

					ADRIENNE
				(chattering)
			This is unbelievable!  A walking,
			talking Earth 1 ancestor.  I got a
			million questions.

					LOWE
			Save it for later.  Complete a full
			endothelic structural scan on the large
			body.

					ADRIENNE
			Not a problem.

					LOWE
			Take point on this one.  Use Kinsa and
			Stoney.  They're second year so lead
			them through it step by step.

					KINSA
			Good deal.

					ADRIENNE
			They'll just slow me down.

					LOWE
			Just take them through it.  Log him in
			properly and place him in stasis.  I'll
			check back with you.

					ADRIENNE
			Right.

	INT. LAB ONE - CONTINUOUS

	Azrael is set up on the Nanotech 1000, assisted by Brodski
	and Tsunaron.

					AZRAEL
			My arm, it's not on my body, dude.

					BRODSKI
			It will be, just give it a few minutes.

					TSUNARON
			Lie back, man.  Let our beautiful
			Nanotech 1000 make your arm as good as
			new.

					AZRAEL
				(as if saying it for the first
				time)
			My arm, man, it's not on my body, dude.

					TSUNARON
			We gotcha, man.  Just lie back and don't
			move.

	PAN OFF

	To Waylander throwing switches and monitoring readouts.

					WAYLANDER
			How much Etherene did you give him, Kay
			Em?

					KAY-EM 14
			Normal dosage for trauma.  50ccs.

	Waylander shakes his head.  Some kids just can't handle
	drugs.  

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Rowan's body already lays on the Nanotech 2000 as Lowe takes
	charge.

					LOWE
				(to Way)
			Where are we?

					WAYLANDER
			Board's all green.  The N2's warm and
			ready, teach.

					LOWE
			Good.  Kay-Em begin stabilizing any
			cellular fractures.

					KAY-EM 14
			Yes, Professor.

	Kay-Em begins typing.

					LOWE
			Janessa.  Give me a full scan.  Glycerol
			levels, cerebral perfusion saturation,
			the works.

					JANESSA
			I live to serve, Professor.

					LOWE
			Let's see what we are dealing with.

					JANESSA
			Thaw rate has accelerated. 
			Decrystalization of the membranes is now
			at 32 percent and rising.

					LOWE
			Good.  Someone get those clothes off
			her.

					WAYLANDER
			I got it.

					JANESSA
			I got it.

	She takes a pair of SURGICAL SCISSORS and starts to cut Rowan
	free.

					JANESSA (CONT'D)
			Honestly, you'd think you'd never seen a
			woman before.

					WAYLANDER
			Not a 400-year old naked one.

					JANESSA
			And the difference would be?

					LOWE
			Waylander, where are her diffusion
			barriers?

					WAYLANDER
			Seventeen and stable.

	PAN BACK TO THE N1000

	Tsunaron makes an adjustment to Azrael's arm and hits a
	switch.

					TSUNARON
			Here we go.

	The N1000 hums to life.

					TSUNARON (CONT'D)
				(working the control panel)
			Az, when I was 12, I fell into a tri
			baler.  Took one of my legs clean off. 
			Look at this, good as new.

					AZRAEL
			Great looking leg, man.

	Brodski points to the monitor.

					BRODSKI
			See, there.  That's your arm.

					TSUNARON
			Sit still, now.  Or you'll have an elbow
			where a wrist should be.

					AZRAEL
			Right.  Like I'm gonna interfere with
			defracturization.  It's not like I've
			never been W.O.A.  You know.

	The healing process continues.

	ANGLE ON ROWAN

	As Janessa removes Rowan's shirt --

					WAYLANDER
			Damn!  Talk about your hard nipples.

					JANESSA
			They can't be real.  Kay-Em, check for
			silicone.

					TSUNARON
			She's kidding.

	Janessa cuts off Rowan's underpants.

					WAYLANDER
			Oh, boy.

	Waylander's a hound.  But Janessa can live with it.

					JANESSA
			And she's clear.

	Janessa places the thermal blanket over Rowan.

					LOWE
			Okay, what next?

					WAYLANDER
			Finish removing the vitrified
			extracellular solution?

					LOWE
			That will happen spontaneously.

					TSUNARON
			Introduce metabolic inhibitors into the
			cytoplasm.

	Tsun does know his stuff.

					LOWE
			Very good.

					JANESSA
			I knew that.

					KAY-EM 14
				(to Tsun)
			I knew that too.

	Waylander presses a button on a console.  An overheard probe
	lowers and the table begins to glow, bathing Rowan with
	radiant heat.

					LOWE
			Stay positive, people.  This will take a
			little while.
				(re: Azrael)
			How is he?

					BRODSKI
				(monitoring progress)
			Just a couple more adjustments.

					LOWE
			Good.

	Lowe checks one of the many monitors involved in Rowan's
	scan.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

					BRODSKI
				(satisfied)
			Son, you're damn near good as new.

					AZRAEL
				(re: Rowan)
			Hey, who's the grizzle grabber.

					TSUNARON
			We brought her back from Earth.

					AZRAEL
			Can I have her?

					TSUNARON
			Absolutely.

	The nano-process is complete.

					TSUNARON (CONT'D)
				(re: arm)
			Try it out.  Go on.

	He rubs his arm.  Not too bad.

					AZRAEL
			All right.
				(as he gets to his feet)
			Whoa, still a little dizzy.

					BRODSKI
				(sweetly)
			Easy boy.  Just take it easy.

					AZRAEL
			Yeah, right.  Everybody, I'm goin' to
			the grid.  Kay?

	That's fine with everybody.  Including Az.  The drugs will be
	with him for a while, yet.

	Azrael exits and the STEADICAM follows him into the hallway
	where STONEY enters Lab Two carrying some equipment.  The
	Camera follows him into --

	INT. LAB TWO - CONTINUOUS

	Adrienne stands at a computer.  Kinsa is around.

					ADRIENNE
				(talking to the computer)
			Specimen 4420 found in sector 3930L on
			Earth Prime.  Subject discovered in
			complete cryosuspension.  Severe loss in
			the axoplastic proteins as well as major
			hemorrhaging in most major organs
			renders subject invalid.

					STONEY
				(re: equipment)
			Where do you want this?

					ADRIENNE
				(to Stoney)
			On the Specimen table.

	As Stoney walks, Kinsa gooses him.

					ADRIENNE (CONT'D)
			We need to do a full morphological work
			up on this one.  So let's start with a --

					KINSA
			Cerebral C-Tep Scan.
				(off Adrienne's look)
			What?  I read the same medfiles you do.

					STONEY
			Mmmm.  Smart and sexy.

	Kinsa smiles at the compliment as he touches her shoulder.

					ADRIENNE
			Initiating scan.

	A computerized model of Jason appears on the monitor.

					ADRIENNE (CONT'D)
			Weight 309.7 mercrons.

					STONEY
			Big sucker.

					KINSA
			I bet he's hung like a mammoth.

	Kinsa reaches below the table for Stoney's thigh.

					ADRIENNE
			There's been massive cerebral
			diminishment.  Even more than would be
			expected in a --

	Adrienne looks over at Kinsa and Stoney playing a game of
	nipple grab.  They stop when they realize they've been
	caught.

					KINSA
			Sorry.  You were saying?

					ADRIENNE
			Look, why don't you two take a break.

					STONEY
			No, we'll help.

					KINSA
			No problem.

					ADRIENNE
			I can handle this.  Come back in an
			hour.  We'll but him into stasis when
			you -- when you're more focused.

					STONEY
			You mean that?

					KINSA
			Thanks, Adrienne.

	They exit.

					ADRIENNE
			Don't mention it.
				(hits a button)
			Professor.
				(then)
			The cerebrum has shrunk so much the
			proteins make identification of
			individual nerve fibres impossible.

					LOWE (O.S.)
			Amazing.
				(then)
			See what you can salvage from the optic
			cortex, then move on.

					ADRIENNE
			My pleasure, professor.

	INT. LAB ONE - CONTINUOUS

	Jason's 3-D SCAN appears on one of the big monitors.

					ADRIENNE (O.S.)
			Look at the brain on the male subject.

					LOWE
			Amazing.

					TSUNARON
			How could he function with a brain that
			small?

					JANESSA
			Way manages.

					WAYLANDER
			Very funny.

	Suddenly BEEP BEEP BEEP.  Alarms blare around Rowan.

					JANESSA
			Professor!

					WAYLANDER
			She's de-animating!

					JANESSA
			The lipids in her cytoplasm are
			separating.

					TSUNARON
			GTT is 59 and rising.

					LOWE
			Kay-Em.  What's her maximum limit
			transition temperature.

					KAY-EM 14
			80 degrees, sir.

	INSERT MONITOR

	indicates Glass Transition Temperature gauge.  It reads from
	20 to 90 with everything above 70 indicated by a bright red
	danger zone.

					TSUNARON
			We're at 61 and rising...

					BRODSKI
				(quietly)
			Is this bad?

					TSUNARON
				(without missing a beat)
			If we don't reattach her lipids before
			the GTT hits 80 she'll be a 400 year old
			vegetable.

	BEEP!  BEEP!

					LOWE
			So what's happening?!

					WAYLANDER
			Her psychorophillic levels are still at
			45 over 200.

					JANESSA
			Q.E.P.'s are green.

					TSUNARON
			Metabolic inhibitors are all in.  What
			about cryoprotectant in her lymphatic
			system.

					LOWE
			No.  Her potassium levels would be off
			the scale.

	INSERT

	Gauge rising.

					KAY-EM 14
			GTT.  68 and rising.

					LOWE
			Stay focused.  Find it.  And find it

					TSUNARON
			Initiating a Hex2 charge.

					KAY-EM 14
			Engaged.

					TSUNARON
			Again.

					WAYLANDER
			Still nothing, professor?

					KAY-EM 14
			GTT passing 72.

					JANESSA
			Lipids still falling.

					LOWE
			Damn it!

	BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!  PUSH IN on concerned faces.  They are
	losing her.

	BEEP!  BEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeepppppppp!  Suddenly Janessa
	realizes something and starts moving switches.  She's found
	the problem!

					JANESSA
			I got it!

					KAY-EM 14
			Lipid cohesion positive.

					WAYLANDER
			Glass Transition Temperature 67 and
			falling.  We're in the safe level.

					JANESSA
			Basal Core Temp was too low causing a
			phase separation of lipid.

	The beeping has stopped.  There's a big sigh of relief.

					TSUNARON
			What the hell'd you do?

					JANESSA
			Her potassium saturation was causing the
			hippocampal dendrites to fire early.

					LOWE
			Which caused the lipids to lose their
			cohesion.  Good catch, Janessa.

					JANESSA
			I had a good teacher.

	New deal.

					LOWE
			Good bring her up slow and steady.

					TSUNARON
				(mimicing)
			I had a good teacher.

					JANESSA
			Shut up.

					LOWE
			Ready phase two.  Are we stable?

					WAYLANDER
			Stable.

					KAY-EM 14
			Ready sir.

					JANESSA
			Stable.

					LOWE
			Start cell reconstruction.

					TSUNARON
			Initiating res sequence.

					WAYLANDER
			Bring on the Ants!

					LOWE
			Cross your fingers people.

					KAY-EM 14
			Temperature 96.2...97...

	The Nano process begins.  A tense beat.

					WAYLANDER
			Tsun, what'a ya got?

					JANESSA
			Tsun?!

					KAY-EM 14
			97.6...

					TSUNARON
			I don't know yet!

	They stay focused on the monitor.

					KAY-EM 14
			98...98.6... and holding!

	ON ROWAN'S BODY

	Her wound begins to repair from the inside.

					TSUNARON
			Cool!  It's working!

	ON SCREEN

	Nano-Ants do stuff.

					KAY-EM 14
			Cell reproduction is complete.  Internal
			defib in three, two, one.

	Rowan's body jerks, her eyes FLUTTER open.  Suddenly:

	WHAM!

	She jerks upright, hitting Lowe square in the FACE!  Lowe
	stumbles backwards.

					KAY-EM 14 (CONT'D)
			Heart.  BP.  Brain waves all show green. 
			Vital signs are normal and strong.

					LOWE
			No shit.  I think she broke my nose.

	Brodski smiles and leans close to Waylander.

					BRODSKI
			I like her already.

	Lowe covers Rowan with a blanket.  She looks frightened,
	confused.

					LOWE
			Easy, easy.

	Rowan looks up.  Finally she smiles.  An attempt to be nice.

					ROWAN
			Did you get him?

	The kids glance at each other.  What was she talking about?

					LOWE
			Got who?  

					ROWAN
			Then he's still out there?!

					LOWE
			Shhh, everything's alright.  No one's
			out there.  You're safe here.

	Rowan takes a breath.  Looks around.

					ROWAN
			Where am I?  Last thing I remember there
			was a leak in the cryo-unit.  Is it
			contained?

					LOWE
			It was contained, but when the cryo-unit
			ruptured, you didn't escape it.  It put
			you into stasis.

	Rowan looks around.  The equipment, the clothes...

					ROWAN
			My God.  How long?

	Lowe considers, then --

					LOWE
			The year is 2455.

	Another smile.  Are they putting her on?

					ROWAN
			2455...

					LOWE
			I know this is a huge shock, but you're
			safe with us.  We're aboard Grendel, a
			class IV Catamaran transport ship. 
			We're on our way home.  You're going to

	Rowan isn't sure what to make of this.

	There's a KNOCK at the door.  Lowe sticks his head in.

	Rowan, now dressed, stands near a VIEWPORT, staring out into

	a beat.  Cleaned up, she is quite beautiful.

					LOWE
			I brought you something to eat.  Not
			much longer and we'll be at Earth II.

					ROWAN
			Earth II?  What about Earth?

					LOWE
			It's dead.  The oceans, the soil. 
			Neither will sustain life.  Is there
			anything I can do for you?

					ROWAN
			Super Bowl tickets on the fifty yard

					LOWE
			I beg your pardon?

					ROWAN
			Am I going to be alright?

					LOWE
				(Marcus Welby warm)
			You should be completely normal.  Don't
			worry.  We'll keep an eye on you.

	Isn't that the damnedest thing?

					ROWAN
				(light)
			Why did you bring me back?

					LOWE
			Seemed like the right thing to do.

					ROWAN
			I'm just confused.

					LOWE
			I can imagine.

					ROWAN
			How do you thank someone who gives you
			your life back?

					LOWE
			You'll live a long time.  We'll figure
			something out.
				(off her smile)
			You want to tell me what happened down
			there?  I take it being stabbed and
			frozen wasn't part of the plan.

					ROWAN
			It's a long story.

					LOWE
			I'm a good listener.

					ROWAN
			It's classified.  If I told you, I'd
			have to kill you.

					LOWE
			Oh dear.

					ROWAN
			It's a joke.
				(sighs, then)
			I'm a Project Leader.  I was a Project
			Leader at Crystal Lake Research.  Jason
			Vorhees was the subject.

					LOWE
			Jason Vorhees?

					ROWAN
			Notorious murderer.  We executed him for
			the first time in 2008.

					LOWE
			The first time?

					ROWAN
				(smiles wearily)
			Electrocution, gas, firing squad... we
			even hung him once.
				(beat)
			Nothing worked.  Finally it was decided
			if we couldn't terminate him, at least
			we could contain him.  Cryogenic stasis. 
			Freeze him until we could figure it out.

					LOWE
			Sounds sensible.

					ROWAN
			I thought so.  But people who were too
			smart for their own good felt a creature
			that couldn't be killed was too valuable
			to be filed away.
				(an amen)
			In the end it always comes down to

			PULL BACK AS

	SHOOOK!  Adrienne lifts the mask from Jason's frozen face.

					ADRIENNE
			Poor baby, I can see why you wore that

			Sure, they're great.  I wasn't sure that

	Two-shot.  Both stay completely still.

					KINSA
			Because...

					STONEY
			Because Kinsa is the most beautiful,
			most sexy girl in the universe.
				(optional)
			And I want to go down on her.

					KINSA
			Okay.  That oughta do it.

	He kisses her.  She allows it, then --

					KINSA (CONT'D)
			Bed!

	A bed slides out from the wall, hitting Stoney in the back of
	the legs.  He falls.  She leaps on top of him.

	INT. LAB TWO - CONTINUOUS

	SHMACK.  Thick black goo glops to the floor from Jason's
	body.  SHMACK.

	Rhythmic and steady.  It's not unlike a ticking clock.  Jason
	is clearly thawing.  Adrienne takes the recently removed
	EYEBALL over to the sink and dips it into the liquid
	nitrogen.  It FREEZES INSTANTLY.

	INT. LOWE'S CABIN - CONTINUOUS

	CLOSE ON A NIPPLE

	Firmly clamped by the strange CHROME TOOL.

					LOWE (O.S.)
			Harder!  Harder!

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL 

	Janessa astride Lowe.  Wearing a see-through charcoal dental
	dam top, she works his nipple with one hand while drinking
	champagne with the other.  She pours some on his chest.

	INT. STONEY'S CABIN - CONTINUOUS

	Kinsa rips off Stoney's shirt.  They are giggling and happy.
	Stoney grabs her and rolls on top of her.  Stoney kisses her
	neck gently.  Then lightly BITES her --

							QUICK CUT TO:

	INT. LAB TWO - CONTINUOUS

	CLOSE ON JASON'S HAND

	It curls, the frozen joints crackle.  The noise draws
	Adrienne's attention from her workstation where she's
	studying the eye.  A huge chunk of thawing goo SPLATS on the
	floor.  Satisfied that she's identified the source of the
	sound, she goes back to inspecting the eye.

	INT. STONEY'S CABIN - CONTINUOUS

	Stoney glides his tongue down her body until he reaches the
	top of her cotton underpants.

	CLOSE ON KINSA'S FACE

	A moment.  Then she GASPS!

	INT. LAB TWO - CONTINUOUS

	Jason's leg JERKS!  Adrienne doesn't notice as she places the
	frozen eye in a specimen tray.

	INT. STONEY'S CABIN - CONTINUOUS

	Stoney and Kinsa, eye to eye.  Both GASP as he enters her.

	INT. LAB TWO - CONTINUOUS

	JASON SITS UP!

	CLOSE ON

	Adrienne.  She transfers samples of Jason's goo to a
	microscope slide, slots the slide into the microscope and
	peers in.

	A SHADOW FALLS over her.  She adjusts her light.  She turns
	and stares in silent shock at Jason.  She opens her mouth to
	scream, but Jason GRABS HER by the throat!  She kicks wildly
	as he studies her, then --

	Throws her across the room.  She slams into the glass
	partition, looking into --

	INT. LAB ONE - CONTINUOUS

	Waylander works at a monitor.  Through the glass beside him,
	we see Adrienne screaming, beating the glass.  But NO SOUND. 
	The labs are mutually soundproof.

	BACK TO LAB TWO AS -- 

	Jason grabs Adrienne by the scruff of her neck and drags her
	to the sink.

	POV FROM SINK

	Looking up, as Adrienne's face is shoved into the liquid
	nitrogen.  Her SCREAMING face FLASH FREEZES before our eyes.

	Her body goes limp.  Jason pulls her up and stares at her
	frozen head.  Her eyes open, mouth locked in a scream.

	He shoves her head against a counter top.  The head SHATTERS
	and the pieces rain down on the floor as he tosses the body
	across the room.

	Jason heads for the door.  Pauses.  A glint of gleaming metal
	catches his eye.

	ON A TRAY OF DISSECTION TOOLS

	The tray is full of futuristic autopsy instruments: self
	powered cutting utensils, chest crackers, rib spreaders, and
	one very, very, VERY LARGE chrome, sharp, lethal blade. 
	Jason's wet dream of a killing tool.

	He picks it up and heads for the door.

	INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

	Jason exits the lab and moves slowly down the passageway.

	INT. BAY ONE - GAME GRID - CONTINUOUS

	Dallas, one of the EX-GRUNTS, moves through a maze of oozing
	walls, dripping pipes and weird, Rube Goldbergesque ductwork.
	He's dressed in full military garb, a huge gun strapped to
	his shoulder.

	STALKING POV

	Something watches Dallas, his back to us.  Dallas stops,
	listens.  He stares toward the stalker, but sees nothing,
	then continues on.

	The stalker closes in.  Suddenly Dallas rolls and comes up
	with his weapon ready.

	HIS POV

	A huge ALIEN CREATURE leaps at him, all dripping fangs and
	sharp claws.  Dallas FIRES!  The blaster hits home.  The
	alien is blown to pieces.

	His back against a stack of STEEL CRATES, Dallas SIGHS and
	wipes his brow.  Suddenly another ALIEN rises from behind the
	crates.  It leans in close over Dallas.

	A glob of clear, shiny goo drips from its mouth and splats on
	Dallas' helmet.  Dallas feels the impact and rubs hi hand up
	there tentatively.  Apprehensively.

	He turns and looks up.  There's nothing Dallas can do.  He's
	a goner.  Then --

	FZZZZT! A burst from elsewhere BLASTS the creature.  

	MOVE TO REVEAL

	Azrael, wearing combat gear several sizes too big.  Smoking
	gun in his hand, goofy grin on his face.

					AZRAEL
			I just saved your ass.

					DALLAS
			Don't get too cocky.

					AZRAEL
			I mean, you must really feel like a
			wuss.

					DALLAS
			Check the score, kid.  It's still nine
			to-three.

					AZRAEL
			Yeah, but I'm in the groove now.  What
			do you say?  Next kill wins?

	Dallas punches Azreal's helmet in a brotherly gesture.

					DALLAS
			Lock and load, killer.

	AND right on cue, we hear a horrible screech.  Dallas and
	Azreal spin with weapons ready in time to see 

	ANOTHER HUGE CREATURE loping toward them.  As they take aim,
	the ALIEN is sliced in HALF!  Green goo squirts from its
	body.  It crumples to the deck.

					AZRAEL
			My kill!

					DALLAS
			No, Id say that was his kill.

	JASON VORHEES

	Steps across the disemboweled creature, his autopsy knife
	slick with goo.

					AZRAEL
			What the hell? 

					DALLAS
			I thought this was an alien sim.

					AZRAEL
			It is.

	Azrael speaks to no one in particular.

					AZRAEL (CONT'D)
			Pause play.

	Jason stares at them for a beat then takes a step forward.

					AZRAEL (CONT'D)
			I said, "Pause play."

	Jason continues to advance.  He raises his knife.

					DALLAS
			He's not pausing.

					AZRAEL
			I'm aware of that.

	Jason walks up to them.  Tilts his head like a dog hearing a
	high-pitched whistle.  Why aren't they running.

					AZRAEL (CONT'D)
			We may need to reboot.

	Jason raises his silver blade high.  SLASH!  Azrael's torso
	from his collarbone to his stomach, is separated.  

	Blood fountains everywhere as a great chunk of Azrael's body
	falls away.  Azrael does not seem hurt, only pissed.  He
	turns to Dallas, who's laughing his head off.

					AZRAEL (CONT'D)
			That doesn't count as a kill.

					DALLAS
			Oh, yes it does.

	Jason is confused.  He spins and SLASHES, taking Dallas' head
	clean off.

					DALLAS (CONT'D)
			Okay, screw this.  Game over.

	ENGINES WHINE and shut down.  LIGHTS FLICKER.  Suddenly the
	eerie lighting and strange pipes and ductwork disappear. 
	Jason finds himself, alone, within --

	INT. BAY TWO - CONTINUOUS

	NOTE: Bay Two is the same as Bay One without all the cargo.

	Which makes it a large, dark, empty room.  Jason looks
	around, disoriented. 

	AZRAEL AND DALLAS

	They're at opposite ends of the room, legs crossed, seated on
	the floor.  They hold strange orbs with blinking lights and
	three pronged wire are inserted into their temples.  They
	seem to snap out of their VR sleep.

	Suddenly Jason spots Azrael and starts towards him, grabs him
	by the throat and lifts him off the floor.  Azrael's eyes
	bulge and his feet kick spastically. 

	Dallas pulls his sidearm and races toward Jason.

					DALLAS
			Drop the kid!  I said drop the kid! 
			Now!!

	Dallas fires a shot into Jason's leg.  Jason tosses Azrael
	aside and turns to Dallas.

					DALLAS (CONT'D)
			Azrael, get out of here!

	As Jason moves toward Dallas, he backs away and fires two
	SHOTS into his chest.  Suddenly, Azrael leaps on Jason's
	back.  Dallas jerks his weapon into the air.

					DALLAS (CONT'D)
			What are you?!  Get out of there!  I got
			no shot!!

	Jason grabs Azrael and swings him around and breaks his back,
	then tosses the heap to the ground.  Dallas stares in shock
	as Jason grabs the gun hand.  A shot is fired.

	Jason spins Dallas around and slams his head into the ships
	hull wall.  WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!  Finally, Dallas falls dead to
	the ground.

	INT. LAB ONE - CONTINUOUS

	Tsunaron and Janessa are seated across from one another,
	staring.  Waylander is working on the Nanotech 2000.

					JANESSA
			Just admit it.  You want me.

					TSUNARON
			I could never be with a girl who's balls
			are hairier than mine.

	Rowan and Lowe enter.

					LOWE
			Guys, our star patient is back.  Rowan,
			this is Tsunaron, Janessa and Waylander.

	Tsunaron and Janessa say their "Hi's."

					JANESSA
				(not bitchy)
			Looks like my clothes fit.

					ROWAN
				(grateful)
			These are yours?  Thank you.
				(noticing specimens in the
				wall)
			Wow!  What're these?

					TSUNARON
			Janessa's love children.

					JANESSA
			That wit is the reason you haven't had a
			real date since I've known you.

	Brodski enters, followed by Kay-Em.

					LOWE
			And of course, you've already met
			Sergeant Brodski.

					BRODSKI
			Ma'am.

					JANESSA
			And Kay-Em 14.
				(Kay-Em smiles)
			Tsunaron's love machine.

					TSUNARON
			Would you stop it.
				(defensive; to Rowan)
			Kay-Em's an advanced knowledge Matrix
			android that I have been programming.

					WAYLANDER
			Is that what you call it?

	This is apparently a running joke with Tsunaron.  They're all
	having fun with him.  It doesn't bother Kay-Em at all.

					ROWAN
			Amazing.  You seem so real.

					KAY-EM 14
				(cheerful as ever)
			I am real.

	Maybe Rowan has fallen through the rabbit hole.  Lowe wants
	to get on with business.

					LOWE
			Well, I thought we might take a look at
			your friend.  Run some tests before we
			determine the best preservation
			protocol.

					ROWAN
			My friend?

					TSUNARON
			Big fella in the mask.

					ROWAN
			He's not my friend.  He killed everyone
			then came after me.  He's alive?  On
			this ship?!

					LOWE
			Our scans reveal he is very dead.

					ROWAN
			Then your scans are wrong.
				(off his look)
			You should definitely dump him into
			space or something.

					LOWE
			That would be irresponsible and
			foolhardy.  He is a valuable scientific
			artifact.  And must be carefully
			preserved.
				(condescending smile)
			Just like yourself.

					ROWAN
			Freezing him just stopped him.  It
			didn't kill him.  He's not dead.

					LOWE
			Believe me, he's definitely dead.

					ROWAN
			Where is he?

	INT. LAB TWO - MOMENTS LATER

	Lowe and the others stare at the empty slab in shock.  

					JANESSA
			Ohmygod!

	ADRIENNE'S HEADLESS BODY lay on the cold floor.

					BRODSKI
			Everyone back off and don't touch a
			thing!

					LOWE
			What the hell happened here?

					ROWAN
			You let the guy thaw, didn't you?

					LOWE
			What?  Don't be silly.

	Brodski takes a knee and begins looking over the crime scene.

					ROWAN
			I'm telling you, he got up off that slab
			and he killed her and I guarantee you,
			he's up walking around right now looking
			for someone else to kill.

					JANESSA
			But he was frozen solid.

					ROWAN
			So?  So was I.

					TSUNARON
			He's frozen and he's dead.

					ROWAN
			No he's not.  He's Jason Vorhees.

					LOWE
			Young lady, I think you're a bit
			hysterical.

	Rowan turns and faces Lowe.  Her face a grim mask.

					ROWAN
			Do I look hysterical, Professor?

					BRODSKI
			I'm putting us on lockdown.
				(into mic)
			Lou, how long till we make Solaris?

					FAT LOU (V.O.)
			Forty-seven minutes.  Give or take.

					LOWE
			I don't believe this.

					BRODSKI
			What part of that dead body do you not
			believe?

					LOWE
			That's not what I meant.

					BRODSKI
			I know what you meant.  
				(into mic)
			Attention.

	INT. GRENDEL BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

	Fat Lou listens.  

					BRODSKI (O.S.)
			We have a hostile on board.

	He looks around the bridge, peering into dark shadows, half
	expecting something to jump them now.

	INT. WEAPONS HOLD - CONTINUOUS

	The remaining GRUNTS listen.

					BRODSKI (O.S.)
			Repeat: hostile on board.

	INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS

	Crutch hunches over his workbench, wearing a set of wireless
	headphones.  We hear faint CLASSICAL MUSIC emanating from
	them.

					BRODSKI (O.S.)
			Grunt team report to weapons.

	Concentrating intently on something we can't see, and humming
	along with the music, Crutch doesn't react at all to
	Brodski's chilling announcement.

	INT. STONEY'S CABIN - CONTINUOUS

					BRODSKI (O.S.)
			Everyone else report to Lab One
			immediately.

	Stoney and Kinsa struggle into their clothes.  Stoney hits a
	button on the wall.

					KINSA
			Wait a second.

					STONEY
			Well, hurry up!

	Stoney turns to face the opening door.  There stands Jason!

	KINSA'S POV

	The metal AUTOPSY KNIFE bursts through Stoney's back!

	ON KINSA

	Blood spatters across her face.  She screams.  Stoney turns
	to her, the huge knife buried up the hilt in his chest.  He
	reaches for her, but --

	Jason wraps a beefy hand around the knife blade and pulls
	Stoney backward out into the corridor.  Kinsa races out of
	the room, SCREAMING.

	INT. LAB TWO - CONTINUOUS

	Brodski is emotionally jacked up, his jaw set.  Clearly in
	assault mode.

					BRODSKI
			You found all your kids yet?

					LOWE
			Yes, look.  Sergeant Brodski, what are
			your plans?

	Brodski's radio CRACKLES.

					KICKER (O.S.)
			Sarge, Grunt team's assembled.  Dallas
			is a no show.

					LOWE
			Sergeant...

					BRODSKI
			Where the hell is he?!

					KICKER (O.S.)
			Dunno, Sarge.

					TSUNARON
			I think he and Az are in Bay Two. 
			Playing one of my game sims.

					LOWE
			Sergeant!  I think we should talk.

	Suddenly, the lab door SHUSHES open.  All eyes turn to see --

	KINSA

	Standing there, nearly naked, deep in shock.  Covered in
	blood.

					KINSA
			St...Stoney's dead.

	She stumbles in and falls to the floor in tears.  Lowe and
	Janessa rush to her.

					BRODSKI
				(into radio)
			Kicker, I want full tac and armor.  Two
			minutes.  Whoever this guy is, I don't
			want anything left of him by the time we
			reach Solaris!

					KICKER (O.S.)
			Roger that!

					LOWE
			Whoa, don't want anything left of him?! 
			What are you talking about?

					BRODSKI
			Everyone get to Lab One and stay there
			until you hear from me.

	Brodski heads out.

	INT. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE LAB TWO - CONTINUOUS

	Brodski bulls through the doors, double-checking his sidearm.
	Lowe follows him out.

					LOWE
			Sergeant Brodski.

	Brodski pauses, pissed.

					BRODSKI
			Don't leave those kids alone.  What the
			hell's the matter with you?

					LOWE
			We're less than an hour from Solaris. 
			They have seven fully equipped tactical
			units completely capable of handling
			this.  I say we wait and sedate him.

					BRODSKI
			I'm taking this guy out.

	Lowe runs in front of Brodski.  He's at his wits end.

					LOWE
			Sergeant!  I need him alive!

					BRODSKI
			No, you want him alive what you need is
			to get out of my face!

	Brodski pushes past him into the corridor.  Lowe follows.

					LOWE
			Look, Sergeant.  There are other
			considerations.  Financial...
			considerations.

					BRODSKI
			My only consideration is the safety of
			the people on this ship.

					LOWE
			All right!  A hundred thousand.

	Brodski keeps moving.

					LOWE (CONT'D)
			Two hundred.

	Keeps moving.

					LOWE (CONT'D)
			Five!

	Brodski stops, turns back.

					BRODSKI
				(interested)
			Five?

	INT. WEAPONS HOLD - CONTINUOUS

	The remaining five GRUNTS -- Kicker, Sven, Geko, Briggs and
	Condor -- are there.  They are in various stages of battle
	dress.  Brodski enters.

					BRODSKI
			Kicker, Briggs, you'll head to Bay Two. 
			Find Dallas.  Sven, Geko, you got
			Starboard pontoon.  Condor with me.  I
			want full armor, BFG's and Rail-capable
			blasters.

					GEKO
			Hell yeah!

	The team is impressed.  That sort of weaponry means biz.

					SVEN
			So, Sarge, we got permission to download
			some whoop ass on this guy?

					BRODSKI
			I promised the doc we'd take him alive.
				(grunts look bummed)
			So after you've blown him to hell, put
			on in his knee so we can say we tried.

	The team laughs.  "YES!"  They're ready for combat.

	INT. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE BAY TWO - CONTINUOUS

	Kicker and Briggs approach cautiously.  The doors HISS OPEN,
	darkness spilling out from the other side. 

	Their combat sense perks up.  Something's not right.  They
	turn on they're flashlights and ready their weapons.  Kicker
	motions fro them to spread out.

	INT. BAY TWO - CONTINUOUS

	Hard beams of light search for anything.  Kicker finds
	Azrael's body.  He rushes to it, drops to one knee and checks
	for a pulse.

					KICKER
				(into mic)
			Sarge, we've got a body in Bay Two.

					BRODSKI (O.S.)
			Dead?

					KICKER
			Roger that.  I think it's the Azrael
			kid.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Briggs moves through the bay slowly.  Her light falls on
	Dallas' body.

					BRIGGS
			Oh Lord.

	She rolls the body over and checks a pulse.

					BRODSKI
			Sarge, I found Dallas.  He's dead.

	Geko and Sven stare at a bloody trail.

					SVEN
			Sarge, we got a blood trail leading
			toward the Cargo Bay.

	INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR NEAR STONEY'S CABIN - CONTINUOUS

	Brodski and Condor stop.  They both look mad as hell.

					BRODSKI
			Condor, Kicker and I will take Cargo
			main, rest of you take portside.  Stay
			alert.  We want some definite payback on
			his ass.  Breech on my command.

	As Brodski and Condor exit we pan down to see Stoney's body
	at their feet.

	INT. BAY TWO - CONTINUOUS

					KICKER
			Roger that.
				(to himself)
			Time to kill something.

	A HAND reaches out of the darkness.  Kicker JUMPS.  Spins
	with his weapon at the ready.  It's BRIGGS.

					BRIGGS
			Sorry! 

					KICKER
			Don't do that!

					BRIGGS
			Dude, you sort of scream like a girl.

					KICKER
			Screw you.

					BRIGGS
			You wish.

	INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS

	Crutch is again happily working and humming.

	CLOSE OVER HIS SHOULDER

	At last we see what the crusty old guy's working on:
	NEEDLEPOINT!

	STALKING POV

	From a distance, Crutch is being watched.  

	STALKING POV - MOVING

	Crutch drops a skein of thread.  He bends to pick it up and
	glances in the direction of the stalker.  

	CRUTCH'S POV

	The STALKER moves closer from a different vantage as Crutch
	threads a needle with rapt intensity.  In the reflection, we
	see that the stalker is JASON!

	Crutch has finished threading his needle and resumed
	stitching.  We see that he's working on a giant-looking
	sampler that reads "ENGINEERS DO IT WITH PRECISION".

	Jason closes in.  Unseen.  As he's in striking distance --

	The GRUNTS open fire with a barrage of bullets.  Hitting
	Jason and ripping Crutch's workspace to shreds.  Crutch drops
	just in time.  SPARKS fly as the lighting shorts out.  The
	place darkens.

	As the smoke clears.  Jason is gone, Crutch peeks up from the
	floor.

					CRUTCH
			What the hell is going on?

					BRODSKI
			Crutch, out, now?!

	Crutch scrabbles across the floor making his way out to
	safety as Brodski (using hand signals) sends Condor up to the
	catwalk.  The men spread out in two teams, one on each side
	of the Cargo Bay.

	CONDOR

	He's on station on the CATWALK overhead with a massive SNIPER
	RIFLE deployed.

	INT. LAB ONE - CONTINUOUS

	Rowan, Lowe and the kids are huddled together listening. 
	They've patched into the GRUNT team's communications.

					BRODSKI (O.S.)
			Briggs, anything?

					BRIGGS (O.S.)
			Negative.

					ROWAN
			This isn't gonna work.

					LOWE
			I've got everything under control.

					BRODSKI (O.S.)
			Condor?  Anything topside?

					CONDOR (O.S.)
			Nothing yet, Sarge.

					ROWAN
			Jesus, I need a cigarette.

					JANESSA
			I thought those caused cancer.

					ROWAN
			What, you guys can't cure cancer?

					TSUNARON
			Of course we can.

					ROWAN
			Then somebody get me a fucking
			cigarette.

	INT. CARGO BAY - CAT

	Condor scans the cargo bay through the sniper rifle.  

	VIEW THROUGH SCOPE

	Storpods...mining equipment...the Mole stands directly
	beneath his position.

	INT. CARGO BAY - PORTSIDE - CONTINUOUS

	Briggs and Geko move side by side.  Sven brings up the rear.

	POV FROM ABOVE

	As they walk past.

	CLOSE ON SVEN'S FACE

	Sven, suddenly he is yanked out of frame.  In the shadows,
	Sven's neck makes a sickening sound as Jason slowly snaps the
	bone.

	INT. CARGO BAY - STARBOARD - CONTINUOUS

	Sergeant Brodski's stops.  Kicker turns to guard their rear.

	INT. CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

	Briggs and Geko are the first to reach the spot where Jason
	should be.

					BRIGGS
			He was...he was right here!

	Brodski and Kicker have arrived.

					BRODSKI
			Target is gone.  Repeat.  Target is
			gone.

					KICKER
			Where's Sven?

	INT. CARGO BAY - CATWALK

	STALKING POV

	We see Condor scanning the area with his scoped rifle.  The
	stalker moves closer.  

	ON CONDOR

	As he continues to search the area.  Suddenly he turns and
	sees Jason closing in.  In an instant, Condor's combat mode,
	unleashing an arsenal of martial arts moves on Vorhees.

	Jason, of course, absorbs all the blows, then BACKHANDS
	Condor off the catwalk.

	SHPLACK!

	Condor's back has slammed against the Mole's up-thrust drill
	bit.  He SCREAMS!  Blood spews.  He rotates slowly down the
	screw.  It's horrible.

					BRIGGS
				(off Condor's scream)
			That was Condor.

					BRODSKI
			Condor, report!
				(nothing)
			Sven, report!
				(nothing)
			Condor, report.  Repeat, Condor, report!

	INT. LAB ONE - CONTINUOUS

	Our guys have heard enough of the above dialogue to be
	seriously concerned.

	INT. CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE - CONTINUOUS

	Brodski deploys what's left of the GRUNT TEAM: Kicker and
	Geko left.  Brodski and Briggs right.

	KICKER AND GEKO

	Move through the Cargo Bay.  Ducking beneath the SKYHOOKS
	that hang down.  They see Condor.

	INTERCUT

					KICKER
				(into radio)
			Sarge, we've found Condor.

					BRODSKI (O.S.)
			What's his condition?

					GEKO
			He's screwed.

	A NOISE

	They turn and stare at a massive, metallic FREIGHT CUBE.

					GEKO (CONT'D)
			Let's smoke this fucker.

	Kicker and Geko split up, moving around either side of the
	cube.

	KICKER'S POV

	Gun ready, he moves around the CUBE slowly.  As he rounds the
	corner -- GEKO STAGGERS OUT OF THE DARK.  Blood spills from
	Geko's open throat.  He falls down, dead.

	Kicker turns quickly just as Jason raises his steel blade.

	Kicker FIRES.  Jacked up on adrenaline, Kicker pumps a
	HUNDRED ROUNDS into Jason's flesh.

	Jason's body is riddled with bullets.  He FALLS HARD against
	winch hook.

	Kicker leaps for the control and raises Jason off the floor.

					KICKER
				(into radio)
			I got him!  I got him!!

	INT. LAB ONE - CONTINUOUS

					WAYLANDER
			Yes!

	CHEERS from everyone.  Except Lowe.

					WAYLANDER (CONT'D)
			See, they got him.

	ON ROWAN

	She's not so sure.

	INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS

	Kicker FIRES A ROUND right into JASON'S KNEE.

					BRODSKI (O.S.)
			Hang tight.  We're on our way.

	Kicker turns away from Jason and speaks into the radio.

					KICKER
			Take your time.  He ain't goin' nowhere.

	OVER HIS SHOULDER

	Jason drops to the ground.  

	BRIGGS

	Hears Kicker SCREAM

					BRIGGS
			Kicker!  Where are you?!

	ON KICKER

	As he crawls across the floor, blood spewing from his mouth.

					KICKER
			Get out of here.

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL

	He's been split in half at the waist.  His entrails dragging
	behind him.  He stops, glances up.

	HIS POV

	Jason stands over him.  He raises his glistening autopsy
	knife and drives it into Kicker's face.

	INT. LAB ONE - CONTINUOUS

					ROWAN
			Jesus!  Get them out of there.

					LOWE
			They know what they're doing.

	INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS

	BRIGGS rounds a 6X12 crate then another until she finds
	Kicker.

					BRIGGS
			No, no no no...

	Jason steps up behind her.

	ON BRODSKI

					BRODSKI
			Briggs, Kicker, damnit!  Report!  Where
			are you!?

	Brodski races in the direction of Briggs' scream then whirls
	around as something swings in from the darkness IMPALED on a
	huge hook.

	It's BRIGGS.  She swings past him.

					BRODSKI (CONT'D)
			Oh God, Briggs...

	INT. LAB ONE - CONTINUOUS

	Lowe and the kids stare at one another in shock.

					ROWAN
			He's all alone in there.

	INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS

	Brodski's heading toward the Cargo Bay exit.  Suddenly he
	stops.  He stares at the bend ahead.  He raises his gun. 
	Something's not right.  

	OVER HIS SHOULDER

	Jason steps up behind him.  Brodski spins and fires.  But
	Jason absorbs the rounds without flinching.  He twists the
	rifle from Brodski's grip and flings it across the bay.

					BRODSKI
			That's how you want it, huh?

	Brodski pulls out two wicked-looking, jagged-edged BATTLE
	KNIVES.  About two-feet long with stone handles.

					BRODSKI (CONT'D)
			Come and gitcha some.

	Jason pulls out his CHROME SURGICAL TOOL.  They circle each
	other.  This is going to be a real KNIFE FIGHT.  Jason
	lunges.  Brodski side-steps, blades hit blades...

	Jason backhands Brodski, sending him flying. 

	Jason throws his large SURGICAL TOOL at Brodski.

	Brodski ducks his head, and the blade impales the container. 
	Brodski scrambles to his feet, wiping blood from his lips.

					BRODSKI (CONT'D)
			Now you're officially pissing me off.

	Jason's gone.  Brodski spins quickly, checking his rear. 
	Nothing.  He moves left, along a line of Stor-Pods.  Stops.  

	He assumes a defensive position with his back to a pod.  No
	sign or sound of Jason.  Water drips in the distance, then --

	WHAM!

	Jason's hand bursts through the pod, clutching Brodski around
	the neck.  He struggles as Jason hoists him up.  Then --

	SHUNK!

	A steel bar bursts through his gut.

					BRODSKI (CONT'D)
			Man, it's gonna take more than a little
			poke in the ribs to bring this ol' dog
			down.

	SHUNK!

	Another steel shaft pierces Brodski.  

					BRODSKI (CONT'D)
			Yup, that oughta do it.

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL

	Brodski hanging from the pod, twice impaled.

	INT. LAB ONE - CONTINUOUS

	THE COMM is dead.  Nothing but static.  Tsunaron reaches over
	and switches it off.  Silence.

					LOWE
			Such a waste.  I told him, stay calm. 
			Wait until we reach Solaris.  Then get
			your revenge.  But don't go up against
			that killing machine shorthand.  Brodski
			was too proud.

	WHAM!  Pounds from the lab door.  Everyone jumps.

					CRUTCH (O.S.)
			Who locked the door?!

	Tsunaron hits a switch and the door slides open.  Crutch
	enters.  Tsunaron looks past him, out into the empty
	corridor, then quickly closes and locks the lab door.

					CRUTCH (CONT'D)
			Somebody want to tell me what the hell's
			going on?

					TSUNARON
			Grunts are dead.

					CRUTCH
			Which ones?

					TSUNARON
			All of them.

	Lowe turns away and stabs a Comm Stud.

					LOWE
			How much longer before Solaris?

					FAT LOU (O.S.)
			I'm about to bring us out of hyperdrive
			now.

	Lowe disconnects the Comm Mic and turns back to Crutch.

					CRUTCH
			He's trapped in the cargo bay.  We're
			locked in here.  We're safe.

					KINSA
			Will they be able to kill him?

					LOWE
			Absolutely.  Relax, people.  I've been
			in constant contact with Solaris.  They
			have 60 highly trained professionals
			standing by to get us off.

					WAYLANDER
			No offense, Doc.  But when we get there
			I think I'm gonna drop your class.

	INT. GRENDEL BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

	Fat Lou mumbles as he works.

					FAT LOU
			Damn kids.  Goddamn field trips.  Got me
			working on a Friday.  Bringing psychos
			on my ship.  Be damned if I'm gonna
			clean up the mess.

	Behind him, through the viewport, we see a swirl of vivid
	colors.  Hyperdrive lightspeed.  A BEEPING SOUND emanates
	from the console.  He flips a switch.  The viewport clears. 

	SOLARIS RESEARCH STATION

	Looms in view.  The gorgeous space city fills the viewport
	with the rising crescent of EARTH TWO visible beyond.

	Suddenly, the ship-to-ship radio crackles to life.

					VOICE (O.S.)
			Solaris to Grendel.  We have you on
			approach. Standby for docking number.

	Fat Lou goes to the COMM.

					FAT LOU
			Grendel to Solaris.  We need medical and
			military at the gate.  We've got a gib
			goddamn problem here!

					VOICE (O.S.)
			What kind of problem, Grendel?

	Then Jason steps out of the darkness behind him.  He was in
	there all along!

					VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
			Repeat, what kind of problem?

	Lou starts to respond but the words die in his throat as he
	sees Jason's reflection in the viewport.

					FAT LOU
				(into mic)
			I'm dead.

	ANGLE ON THE VIEWPORT

	Solaris looms closer, just beautiful against the velvety
	black night.  Blood sprays across the viewport, spoiling the
	view.

					VOICE (O.S.)
			Solaris to Grendel, decrease approach
			speed.  Over.
				(a beat)
			Grendel, you're coming in too hot. Pull
			off!

	A COLLISION ALARM beings to SOUND.  Fat Lou's corpse doesn't
	seem to care.

	INT. LAB ONE - CONTINUOUS

	Our guys REACT to the collision alarm.

					WAYLANDER
			What now?

	Waylander goes to the console and PUNCHES UP an exterior view
	on a monitor.  Solaris is WAY TOO CLOSE and coming up WAY TOO
	FAST!

					WAYLANDER (CONT'D)
			Look out!

	Everyone dives for cover as --

	EXT. GRENDEL - CONTINUOUS

	Grendel SMASHES into SOLARIS!  Grendel slides along the steel
	structure, PEELING BACK huge chunks of metal like a can
	opener.

	INT. LAB ONE - CONTINUOUS

	The lab jerks violently.  Sparks fly.  ALARMS SOUND.  WARNING
	LIGHTS strobe.  Lowe and the kids are slammed into the
	forward wall!

	EXT. GRENDEL - CONTINUOUS

	The ship SCREECHES along the science station, as tiny
	explosions erupt from both.  Grendel's LEFT HULL is SHEARED
	COMPLETELY OFF.

	INT. LAB ONE - CONTINUOUS

	Our heroes are CATAPULTED across the lab into the opposite
	wall!

	KAY-EM

	SLAMS into the N2 Unit in a shower of sparks and FLYING
	GLASS!  Its scanners are knocked askew and flicker on and
	off.

	EXT. GRENDEL - CONTINUOUS

	SOLARIS EXPLODES!  The shockwave slams Grendel!

	INT. LAB ONE - CONTINUOUS

	Our guys are buffeted mercilessly by the shock wave, which
	gradually fades away, only to be replaced by ominous silence.

	Suddenly the SYSTEM LIGHTS flicker and die, replaced after a
	moment by dim BACKUPS.

					TSUNARON
			Everyone okay?

					JANESSA
			What the hell happened?

					ROWAN
			I know I don't have a handle on this
			whole future thing.  But my guess is
			that wasn't a smooth landing.

	Waylander climbs up to look through a viewport.

					WAYLANDER
			Oh my God.  It's... Solaris is gone!

					KINSA
			Gone?!  It can't be gone?!

	Janessa looks as well.

					WAYLANDER
				(testy, utter strain)
			Look for yourself, it's gone.

					KINSA
			It can't be gone.  Where are we gonna
			go?  
				(somebody must have an answer)
			What are we going to do?!

					LOWE
				(snaps)
			I can't think with you screaming!
				(into mic)
			Lou, what sort of damage are we looking
			at?!
				(no response)
			Lou!  Lou?!

	Crutch begins doing diagnostics.

					ROWAN
			Something wrong with the mic?

					TSUNARON
				(trying to deny the obvious)
			You think he could've gotten to the
			bridge?

	Lowe's face says "most likely."  Tsunaron moves to one of the
	consoles.

					TSUNARON (CONT'D)
			I'm sending out a distress beacon.

					JANESSA
				(from viewport)
			We've lost our entire port pontoon,
			guys.

	Janessa crosses behind Crutch.

					KINSA
			Please, can't somebody do something?

					ROWAN
				(off Kinsa's sobs)
			They're trying, honey.

					CRUTCH
			Our internal pressure's holding, but the
			main thrusters are off line.

					LOWE
			Life support?

					CRUTCH
			I can't guarantee anything but she
			should limp along for now.  If I could
			get to the engine core, I might be able
			to...

					KINSA
			But he's out there!

					LOWE
			Let's keep our priorities straight here,
			people.  We're in high traffic lanes. 
			There'll be another ship, I'm sure of
			it.
				(everybody isn't as sure as
				Lowe)
			At least we're safe here.


	WHAM!WHAM!WHAM!WHAM!

	The lab door bucks!  Kinsa screams!  Everyone freezes this is
	the big "Oh shit!" moment. 

					KINSA
			Ohmygod!!!!

					LOWE
			Shut up!!!

	Then SILENCE.

					WAYLANDER
			Maybe he gave up.

					JANESSA
			Yeah, right.

	Rowan shushes him and moves to the door.  She presses her ear
	close to listen.  Janessa has backed up so she now stands
	near the window to Lab Two.

					ROWAN
			I don't think he's out there.

					JANESSA
			Why don't you poke your head out and
			see?

	Before Rowan can answer, THE OBSERVATION WINDOW between LAB
	ONE and LAB TWO SHATTERS as Jason crashes through!

	Mass CONFUSION.  Crutch opens the door to flee, but it JAMS
	halfway.  Jason has damaged too much.

	Jason turns and moves toward Lowe, who grabs Kay-Em and
	shoves her toward Jason. 

	KAY-EM

	Scans the behemoth as the others climb through the crack in
	the door one-by-one.

					KAY-EM 14
			Heart beat irregular.  No blood flow. 
			Humanoid, but not human.

	Jason throws a backhand at Kay-Em.  She ducks and backs up
	into a wall.

					KAY-EM 14 (CONT'D)
			And short-tempered.

					TSUNARON
			Kay-Em, come on!

	Jason takes ANOTHER SWING, but Kay-Em does an IMPOSSIBLY HIGH
	FLYING FLIP over Jason and slips out into the hall.

	The others hurry through. Waylander, the last and the biggest
	of the group, gets stuck.

					WAYLANDER
			What a time to be big-boned.

	Jason rushes toward Waylander, who's suddenly JERKED THROUGH
	from the other side.

	INT. LAB CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

	Rowan, Tsunaron and Waylander crash to the floor and get the
	hell out of there.

	INT. LAB ONE - CONTINUOUS

	Jason PICKS UP Lowe and throws him into a corner.  Lowe hits
	the wall hard and falls onto a lab table.

					LOWE
			Look, look, look, have you considered
			how valuable you are?  Fame, money...
			with my help, you can have it all.

	Jason stops above him.

					LOWE (CONT'D)
			I have the connections.  You name it, I
			can get it for you.  Together we can
			make a fortune.

	But Jason's attention isn't on Lowe.  It's on --

	THE MACHETE

	sticking through Lowe's belt.  Suddenly it dawns on Lowe what
	Jason's after.

					LOWE (CONT'D)
			You want the machete?  Shit, take it. 
			It's yours.  Just remember who saved it
			for you.

	Jason reaches down and slowly, almost gently, plucks the
	machete from Lowe's belt.

					LOWE (CONT'D)
			It's okay!  He just wanted his machete!
				(to Jason)
			You're not going to regret this.

	Jason stares at the two cutting instruments.  Comparing,
	then, drops the old machete to the ground.  Jason raises the
	new machete.

	INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS

	Our guys race in, close and dog the door behind them.

					KINSA
			Where's professor Lowe?

	Some eye contact, everybody's assuming he's toast.  Finally:

					ROWAN
			I think he's in the lab still.

	This answer seems to satisfy Kinsa for now.

					JANESSA
			What do we do now?

					KINSA
			I think I'll go to my room now. 
			Stoney's going to meet me there.

	Poor kid is losing it.

					ROWAN
			How do we get off this ship?

					WAYLANDER
			I don't know, you tell me.

					ROWAN
			How the hell do I know?  Can't you beam
			us off or something?

					WAYLANDER
			"Beam" us off?

	Tsunaron looks up.

					TSUNARON
			The shuttle.

					WAYLANDER
			Hell yeah, the shuttle.  Crutch?

					CRUTCH
			I can do prelaunch from the bridge. 
			Tsun, you'd have to rework the
			navigational module.  It's only set up
			for short hauls.

					JANESSA
			The rest of us will go to the shuttle. 
			Start the checkoff and get some
			provisions.  Call when you're ready to
			reroute the fuel. 

					CRUTCH
			Watch your backs, guys.

					ROWAN
			Thanks.

	Crutch and Waylander slip off.  In the B.G., a huge creak
	followed by a distant explosion.  The Grendel is in trouble.

					ROWAN (CONT'D)
			How long will it take?

					TSUNARON
			Not long, I hope.

					JANESSA
			Let's hit it guys.

	Tsunaron looks around, notices a corpse -- probably Geko --
	and picks up the dead grunt's weapon.  Tsunaron pitches the
	Grunt-gun to Rowan.

					TSUNARON
			You know how to use that?

	Rowan RACKS a cartridge into position.

					ROWAN
			Like ridin' a bike.  Once you do it, you
			never forget how.

					TSUNARON
			Good.
				(to Waylander)
			Kay-Em and I will go to the supply hold. 
			Meet you at the shuttle bay.

	Tsun and Kay-Em head out.

					JANESSA
				(to Rowan)
			What's a bike?

	EXT. GRENDEL BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

	Crutch and Waylander approach carefully, seeing the shattered
	wreck of the bridge door.

	INT. GRENDEL BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

	Crutch and Waylander enter.  They glance over at what's left
	of Fat Lou.

					CRUTCH
			Poor bastard.

					WAYLANDER
			Jesus.  That's twisted.

					CRUTCH
			Course.  I seen worse.

	Crutch moves to the pilot's seat, starts throwing switches. 
	Crutch wipes a copious amount of blood off the control
	screen.  Then pauses, looks around.

					CRUTCH (CONT'D)
			Come here.

					WAYLANDER
			What?

	Crutch wipes his hands clean on Waylander's shirt.

					WAYLANDER (CONT'D)
			Bastard.

	With clean hands, Crutch goes to work.

					CRUTCH
			You're lucky you weren't alive during
			the Microsoft conflict.  Hell, we were
			fighting each other with our own severed
			limbs.

					WAYLANDER
			That's...nice.

	INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS

	Rowan, Kinsa and Janessa move slowly through the dark Cargo
	Bay.  Suddenly they hear a DISTANT SOUND.

					ROWAN
			Quiet.

	Another noise?

					KINSA
			It's him, isn't it?  Isn't it?

					ROWAN
			Quiet.

					KINSA
			But if it's him...

	Kinsa freaks and starts to SCREAM.  Rowan clamps a hand over
	Kinsa's mouth.

					ROWAN
			Make another sound and I'll snap your
			neck.  Got it?

	Kinsa's eyes go wide as she nods.

					JANESSA
			You're good with people.

	SUDDENLY an ELECTRICAL SHORT CIRCUIT fills the Cargo Hold
	with light.  Across the bay, they see a body -- it's MOVING. 
	Hard to tell who it is.

					ROWAN
			My God, I think there's somebody over
			there.

					JANESSA
			I didn't see anything.
				(then)
			We don't have much time.

					ROWAN
			Which way is the shuttle?

					JANESSA
			Straight across.

					ROWAN
			Go.  I'll catch up.

					JANESSA
			Be careful.

	Janessa leads Kinsa toward the Shuttle Bay.  Just as Rowan
	starts toward the body, the LIGHT FAILS AGAIN and she's
	PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS.

	WITH ROWAN

	She works her way edgily across the Cargo Hold, the GRUNT GUN
	held ready.

	She continues, an act of sheer will.  At last she reaches the
	corner of the STOR-POD where she thought she saw the body. 
	She braces herself, whips around the corner to see --

	NOTHING

	Just two bloody steel rods sticking through the STOR-POD.

	Rowan takes a few steps backward, panic seeping in.  Suddenly
	she senses danger to her right -- jumps back and levels the
	grunt-gun all at the same time.  She's this close to firing
	when she sees --

	BRODSKI

	Trashed.  Laying on the floor of Cargo Bay.  How he managed
	to drag himself off the steel rods is anybody's guess.

					BRODSKI
			Hi.

					ROWAN
			Hi.
				(then)
			I better get you outta here.  They're
			refitting the shuttle.

	She drops the grunt-gun and grabs Brodski beneath his massive
	shoulders.  He groans in pain, but she's not strong enough to
	pull him.

					ROWAN (CONT'D)
			I'm sorry.  You're too heavy.  I'll have
			to go get help.

	Brodski grabs her arm.

					BRODSKI
			Save yourselves.  Get the hell out.

					ROWAN
			I'm not leaving you.  I'll get help and
			come back.

	Rowan races toward the shuttle.

	INT. SHUTTLE BAY - CONTINUOUS

	Janessa and Kinsa pass through en route to cockpit.

					JANESSA
			C'mon, girl.  We're going home.

	INT. SHUTTLE COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

	Kinsa sits, puts on COMM-GEAR.  Janessa takes down clipboard
	with check list, etc.

					JANESSA
			You gonna do this thing?

					KINSA
			Absolutely.

	Janessa isn't sure if she believes her or not, but she has no
	choice.

					JANESSA
			Good.  Let's get started.

	Kinsa starts flipping switches and prepares a well-rehearsed
	routine.  They've all done this before.  Janessa exits for
	the Outboard Module.

	INT. SHUTTLE BAY - CONTINUOUS

	Janessa returns, goes to OUTBOARD, pulls on COMM-GEAR and
	starts to hit buttons.  She speaks to Kinsa and Crutch.

					JANESSA
			Kinsa, you there?

					KINSA
			Yes, ma'am.

					JANESSA
			Crutch?

					CRUTCH
			I'm working here, lady.

					JANESSA
			Gotcha.

			Dorsal sensor indicator?

			I'll over-ride.  How's that?

					KINSA
			Dorsal sensor array is engaged.  Nodes
			in flight position.

					JANESSA
			Good.  Lateral spectrum?

					KINSA
			Controls are free and correct.

	A NEW DEAL.  Crutch interrupts.  Waylander is there, helping
	when possible.

					CRUTCH
			Stand by for the Fuel Transfer, cells
			six and seven bypass.

					JANESSA
			Negative, Crutch.  I'm not showing
			isolinear integrity.

					CRUTCH
			Repeat, please.

					JANESSA
			No insolinear integrity.  I think we may
			be screwed here.

					CRUTCH
			Re route through Lem-Pac Fusion Bypass.

					JANESSA
			Say again?  Confirm Lem-Pac Fusion.

					CRUTCH
			That's affirmative.  Lem-Pac Fusion.

	Tsunaron and Kay-Em are loading supplies and some firearms.

			There's enough firepower here to level a

			back to the shuttle.

	As they continue to load up --

					TSUNARON (CONT'D)
			So, what do you think?  You think we're
			going to make it?

					KAY-EM 14
			Statistical probability of survival --
			12 percent.

					TSUNARON
			Can't you do a little better on those
			odds?

					KAY-EM 14
			I didn't choose them, that's what logic
			dictates.

					TSUNARON
			Forget logic, what does your gut tell
			you?

					KAY-EM 14
			If I answer that, aren't you afraid it
			will fry my emotional cortex?

	Tsunaron smiles then takes her face in his hands and kisses
	her.

					TSUNARON
			In case things go bad out there, I just
			wanted you to know how much I care about
			you.

	Kay-Em grabs him forcefully and really kisses him. 

					TSUNARON (CONT'D)
			Whoa.

					KAY-EM 14
			Statistical probability for survival: 53
			percent.

					TSUNARON
			Wow, one kiss jumped us 40 percent?

					KAY-EM 14
			Want to go for a hundred, cowboy?

	INT. SHUTTLE BAY - CONTINUOUS

					JANESSA
			Damnit Crutch, you better know what
			you're doing.

	Crutch switches six different knobs.  We all know this is
	dangerous shit, whatever he's doing.  Finally he hits one.

					JANESSA (CONT'D)
			Yes, Crutch, you did it!  You did it!!

	Rowan enters from Cargo Bay.

					KINSA
			Transfer underway.

					JANESSA
			Master conduit is free of obstructions. 
			We are fueling.

					ROWAN
				(good news)
			Brodski.  It was Brodski.  He's alive.

					JANESSA
			No shit!

					ROWAN
			I can't move him.  Are Way and Crutch
			back?

					JANESSA
			Still on the bridge, rerouting the fuel.
				(pleased)
			They pulled it off...

					ROWAN
			I need help.

	Janessa punches a button for intercom --

	INTERCUT WITH CRUTCH AND WAYLANDER

					JANESSA
			Yo, guys.

					ROWAN
			Show me...

					JANESSA
			Just hold this down.

					ROWAN
			Brodski.  He's still alive in the Cargo
			Bay.  I can't move him by myself.

					CRUTCH
			I can handle it from here.

					WAYLANDER
			On my way.

					ROWAN
			Do we have any kind of stretcher?

					JANESSA
			Check by the first aid.
				(points)
			There.  I'll send Way.
				(back to biz)
			Crutch, how we doing on time?

					CRUTCH
			Time we ain't got, lady.  But with my

					JANESSA
			And a shitload of good luck.

					CRUTCH
			And a giant shitload of good luck.

				play with the console)
			We will be out of here.

	Crutch finishes up his work.  Just as he completes his last

	Crutch hits the all-call intercom button, allowing everybody
	to hear his last words.

					CRUTCH
			Oh, shit.  I've got company, people.

	INT. SHUTTLE COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

	Kinsa sits in the pilot's seat.  Over the intercom, she hears
	Crutch buying the farm.  Kinsa shivers uncontrollably with

	becoming primal.  Feral.

	She sees a button labeled HATCH LOCK and reaches for it --

			Fuck me.

	JASON grabs Crutch and smashes him into the electrical panel,

			Kinsa!  Open the door!

			And this is really a bad time for this!

					ROWAN
			Janessa.  Gentle.
				(into mic)
			Kinsa, honey, can you hear me?  I need
			you to open the door.

	Static, then --

					KINSA (O.S.)
			No...

					ROWAN
			Kinsa, we can go home now, it's over. 
			Just open the door.

					KINSA (O.S.)
			No.

	There are sounds from offstage.  It could be Jason.

					ROWAN
			Open the fucking door right fucking now
			you dumb bitch!!!

					JANESSA
			That was gentle?

	INT. SHUTTLE COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

	Kinsa leans forward and presses a button labeled LAUNCH!

	INT. SHUTTLE BAY - CONTINUOUS

	The LAUNCH LIGHT blinks RED.

					JANESSA
			NO!  Kinsa, the fuel lines are still
			attached!

	EXT. GRENDEL - CONTINUOUS

	The SHUTTLE TEARS away from the docking bay.  Fuel lines
	pulls tight.

	INT. SHUTTLE COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

	Kinsa stares out the window as the shuttle JERKS and stops
	its outward movement.

	EXT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS

	It slides away, held fast by straining fuel lines.  With
	agonizing slowness.  The shuttle SLAMS into Grendel's hull.

	KAFWAM!  The SHUTTLE EXPLODES!



	INT. SHUTTLE BAY - CONTINUOUS

					JANESSA
			Kinsa!

	The impact throws our heroes to the deck.

					WAYLANDER
			Now what?

	At that moment, Jason steps into the boarding area, blocking
	their path.

					JANESSA
			Now what?  Basically, now is when we
			die.

					ROWAN
			Bullshit.

	She levels her gun to fire and CLICK.  It's empty.

					JANESSA
			Great.  Okay, new plan.  When he gets
			you, I'll run.

	They're trapped.  This is it.  Jason closes in. 

					TSUNARON (O.S.)
			Hey, slappy!  Got a little something for
			ya!

	Jason turns around.  Tsunaron stands at the entrance to the
	boarding area, hair mussed, shirt half tucked, big smile on
	his face.  Tsun reaches behind him and grabs the hand of --

	KAY-EM

	The new and improved killer droid!  Her hair is wild, not
	nearly as wild as her eyes, though.  Dressed in reinforced
	battle armor and packing an assortment of high-tech weapons,
	she's a sultry, sexy, and completely lethal work of art.

					WAYLANDER
			Uh, wow.

					TSUNARON
			I gave her an upload.

					JANESSA
			Give me one.

	Jason cocks his head, dumbfounded.  The sight of this
	formidable adversary throws him momentarily off-stride.

	Kay-Em steps forward.  Cool, confident, and ready to rock and
	with one hand wracks her large weapon.

					KAY-EM 14
			'fraid I'm gonna have to hurt-cha now.

	She whips the gun at Jason as he flings his machete at her.
	SHUNK!  The machete slams into her chest and she collapses.

					TSUNARON
			Kay-Em!!!

					JANESSA
			That didn't go so well.

	Jason moves to Kay-Em.  Tsunaron gives ground.  With a deep
	sigh, Kay-Em goes limp.  Jason bends down to retrieve his
	machete.  As he pulls it free.

	Kay-Em's EYES POP OPEN!  She smiles and grabs his wrist.

					KAY-EM 14
			Gotcha!

	Jason looks down and sees the chain gun placed point-blank at
	his chest.  BRRRRAAATTTT!  Jason is hurled through the air
	with machete in hand.  He flies through the doorway and into 

	INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS

	Jason lands hard on his back.  

	BACK TO SHUTTLE BAY

					TSUNARON
				(total pride)
			That's my girl.

	Kay-Em stands in the doorway looking down at Jason.

					KAY-EM 14
			Alright, let's get started.

	Kay-Em flips through the air and lands on top of a 6X12
	crate.  Looks down to find JASON IS GONE!

					KAY-EM 14 (CONT'D)
			Ooo, you wanna play.

	Jason appears behind the crate and slams his hand into it.
	It upturns.  But Kay-Em walks the crate like a river log and
	flips BACKWARDS, landing behind Jason.

					KAY-EM 14 (CONT'D)
			Sorry, chump, not good enough.

	Jason turns to her, the satellite dish over his shoulder. 
	Kay-Em opens fire.  Jason and the satellite beyond are
	riddled with bullets.  

	Through the shards of flying glass and debris, Kay-Em catches
	a glimpse of Jason's retreat.  She moves between two racks
	filled with reflective satellite panels, spots Jason and
	opens FIRE.

	Panels shatter.  She's shooting at his reflection as Jason
	steps up behind her.  Kay-Em realizes her mistake as Jason
	raises his machete.

					KAY-EM 14 (CONT'D)
			Tricky little sumbitch.

	She leaps into a roundhouse kick, but Jason catches her leg
	and flings her through the air.  She tumbles, then lands like
	a cat in the Weapons hold doorway, then BACKFLIPS into the
	weapons hold.

	Jason moves toward the weapons hold.

	INT. WEAPONS HOLD - CONTINUOUS

	Jason enters but finds no Kay-Em.  He glances around then
	moves toward the walkway.

	OVER HIS SHOULDER

	Kay-Em drops to the pedestal in the center of the room.  She
	tosses her gatlin gun aside and pulls her sidearms.

	Jason turns.

					KAY-EM 14
			Peek-a-boo.

	Kay-Em opens fire.  Jason is blown into --

	INT. WALKWAY "B" - CONTINUOUS

	Through a blurred combo of martial arts kicks mixed with
	sidearm onslaught, Kay-Em pushes Jason to the end of the
	walkway where he finally crumbles to the floor.

	Kay-Em immediately FLIPS through the air and lands straddling
	Jason.  She slams the barrels of her sidearms up to his
	temples.

					KAY-EM 14
			Say goodnight, ass --

	KAFWAM!  Jason bashes her in the chest, sending her flying
	backwards.  She crashes onto the floor, begins to rise, but
	Jason's FOOT SLAMS her throat to the ground.

	She struggles to get up, but Jason's too much.  He raises her
	machete.  

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As the kids stare into the hallway, there's nothing they can
	do.  

	JASON

	Brings his machete down when suddenly --

	BRODSKI rises behind Jason and STABS him in the leg.

					ROWAN
			Brodski!

	Jason reaches down and breaks the knife blade.  Kay-Em
	glances up at Brodski.  

					KAY-EM 14
			I had it under control, but thanks.

	She leaps to her feet.

					BRODSKI
			My pleasure.

	The exertion and loss of blood leaves Brodski weak.  He
	stumbles, nearly falls, but Rowan and Waylander catch him.

	Kay-Em points her guns at Jason.

					KAY-EM 14
			As for you...

	She fires a round of bullets at him, describing a circle on
	the wall behind him.

	INT. LAB ONE - CONTINUOUS

	The slugs BURST through the back wall, SHATTERING the
	assorted glassed specimens.

	INT. WALKWAY "B" - CONTINUOUS

	Jason must be wondering why Kay-Em fired AROUND and not AT
	him, but he doesn't contemplate the moment, instead he raises
	his weapon.  

	Kay-Em opens fire again, BLOWING Jason's arm off.  Jason
	stares down at the severed limb as Kay-Em barrels toward him.
	She spins and throws a round-house kick, SLAMMING him RIGHT
	THROUGH the shattered wall!

	INT. LAB ONE - CONTINUOUS

	Jason tumbles through SHATTERING the remaining specimens,
	which fall all around him and cover him with goo.  He lands
	in front of the N2.

	Kay-Em leaps through the hole firing, then holsters her gun.
	She reaches back and retrieves the rocket launcher.  If Jason
	could speak, his first words would probably be "Oh shit!"

					KAY-EM 14
			Now I'm gonna fuck you up.

	And then Kay-Em unleashes a final SAVAGE ONSLAUGHT of
	firepower.  A rocket blows his leg to hell.  Another slams
	into the side of his chest.  

	And finally, Kay-Em zeros in on his head and fires.  

	POV THROUGH JASON'S MASK

	The rocket screams right toward him, then --

	KAFOOM

	A third of his mask and skull is blown to hell.  The
	remaining mass drops to the ground.  And now -- finally --
	Kay-Em approaches with Jason's machete.  She spikes it
	ceremonially in the last little lump of Jason that remains.

					JANESSA
			You did it! 

					WAYLANDER
			All right!

	Tsunaron goes to Kay-Em, who throws her arm around him in a
	very possessive and sexually knowing way.

					KAY-EM 14
			Who's your mama?

	She gives him a lusty kiss.  Rowan turns to Brodski.

					ROWAN
			I was coming back for you.

	Brodski nods.  He believes her.

					WAYLANDER
			Let's get you patched up.

	Rowan helps Brodski into the N2 and Tsun throws a switch.

	EXT. GRENDEL - LATER

	The pathetic sounds of Grendel's distress beacon fill the
	time.

	INT. LAB ONE - CONTINUOUS

	Brodski, Tsun and Rowan are alone in Lab One.  Brodski gets
	off the N2 machine.  He seems pretty healthy and strong. 
	Suddenly the ship RUMBLES.  They grab hold of something
	secure, then --

					ROWAN
			What the hell's that?

					TSUNARON
			Nothing good.

	EXT. GRENDEL BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

	A piece of the hull flies off the ship and floats off into
	deep space.

	INT. LAB ONE - CONTINUOUS

					TSUNARON
			Can you walk?

					BRODSKI
			Better 'n' ever, kid.

	All right, maybe not better than ever, but not too bad. 
	Rowan smiles and Tsun kicks a roll cart out of the way as
	they exit.  The roll cart thumps into the N2, sparks fly.

	The N2 continues to twitch and spasm, sending random scanning
	beams around the lab.  

	ON N2 SCREEN

	We see the simple word: "SCANNING"...

	A SCANNING BEAM hits what's left of Jason's body and stops.

	ON N2 SCREEN

	"DNA SOURCE LOCATED" blinks.

	INT. LAB TWO - CONTINUOUS

	Waylander crosses to the console and punches something up on
	the monitor: a ship's schematic.  Brodski, Rowan and Tsun
	enter.

					WAYLANDER
			We've got trouble.

	They gather around the monitor and check out the schematic
	which shows the whole RIGHT HULL blinking with  RED "CRITICAL
	FAILURE" lights.

					WAYLANDER (CONT'D)
			The collision compromised the hull. 
			She's bleeding out.

					JANESSA
			Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit!

					RESCUE VOICE (O.S.)
			Tiamat to Grendel, Tiamat to Grendel, do
			you read?  Over.  Tiamat to Grendel.  Do
			you read?

	Holy shit, there is a God!  Janessa leaps toward the COMM.

					JANESSA
			Yes, yes.  Thank God!  This is Grendel. 
			Tiamat, we read you!  Can you hear us?!

					RESCUE VOICE (O.S.)
			That's affirmative, Tiamat.  Very
			affirmative.  Please advise us of
			earliest possible ETA.  Situation
			critical.

					RESCUE VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
			ETA 97 minutes.

					WAYLANDER
				(re: schematic)
			We don't have that much time.
				(rushes over; punches the COMM
				button)
			This is Grendel.  Our hull is bleeding
			out.  We're gonna have a core implosion
			in less than thirty minutes.  Do you
			copy?

					RESCUE VOICE (O.S.)
			We copy you, Grendel.  Advise how you
			would like us to proceed?

					JANESSA
			You've got to come now.  Do you copy? 
			Now.

					RESCUE VOICE (O.S.)
			We're four parsecs away, Grendel.

	Waylander considers, then --

					WAYLANDER
			I don't want to take them down with us.
				(beat)
			If you can't get here in half an hour,
			there's no point.

					JANESSA
			What?!  Are you fucking high?!
				(punches comm button)
			Tiamat, this is Grendel!  Ignore the
			last idiot!  You get your ass out here,
			you hear me!  Get your ass out here!

	ON ROWAN

	Staring at the schematic with a stranger's eyes.  She notices
	the BRIDGE SECTION.  Connected to the RIGHT HULL by three
	walkways.

					ROWAN
			Would it help if we just go over here?

					TSUNARON
			No good.  When this hull blows, it'll
			take the bridge with it.

	Waylander crosses to the console and punches something up on
	the monitor.  A ship's schematic.  She points to the WALKWAYS
	connecting the BRIDGE and the RIGHT HULL.

					ROWAN
			Unless we disconnect these walkways.

					WAYLANDER
			You can't disconnect them.

					BRODSKI
			Blow them up?

					ROWAN
			Don't know.

					TSUNARON
			Plenty of macrocharge in the weapons
			hold.

					BRODSKI
			This...this could work.

					WAYLANDER
			Tiamat, we're gonna try something here. 
			If you're game, maintain your current
			course and speed and, God willing, we'll
			see you when you get here.

					RESCUE VOICE (O.S.)
			Roger that.  See you in 95 minutes. 
			Good luck, Grendel.

					BRODSKI
			Let's move out.

	INT. WEAPONS HOLD - CONTINUOUS

	Our group is gathered near the door, macrocharges in hand,
	and cordless headset COMM RIGS in place.

					BRODSKI
			We'll split up and set the charges.  Who
			has the remote?

	Waylander tapes a BLACK BOX belted to his waist.

					WAYLANDER
			Right here, baby.

					BRODSKI
			We'll meet back in Walkway B.

	The teams split up and head out.

	INT. LAB ONE - CONTINUOUS

	We see a schematic of Jason's battered body on the monitor. 
	Beside it is the one Adrienne did when they first brought
	Jason on board.

	The computer is busy comparing the two.  Doing its job. 
	Hoses lower from the N2 and nano-ants pour out from within. 
	They swarm over what's left of Jason's body.  The scanning
	lasers move to the stump at Jason's shoulder.

	ON N2 SCREEN

	"SEARCHING FOR BIO-MATCH"

	Several strands of Nano-ant groups spread out from the body
	and swarm over parts of lab debris.  The swarm pulls assorted
	parts back toward Jason's body.

	ON N2 SCREEN

	"BIO-MATCH LOCATED -- INITIATE TISSUE FORMATION"

	Nano-nats swarm with more intensity as a huge sphere of
	robotic arms swings over the body and joins in to the fun. 
	On the schematic, we see Jason's internal organs being
	repaired.  By now we've figured out...nothing good can come
	from this.

	INT. WALKWAY "A"

	Waylander and Janessa work feverishly, planting a line of
	charges along the steel tube.

	INT. WALKWAY "B" - CONTINUOUS

	Tsunaron and Kay-Em set their charges, then hustle back along
	the walkway.

	INT. WALKWAY "X" - CONTINUOUS

	Brodski and Rowan plant the last of their charges.

					BRODSKI
			Okay, I've got two more that I want to
			put near the core.  Tell Waylander to
			wait for me outside the hold.  I'll be
			another three, four minutes.

					ROWAN
			Got it.  You sure you don't need me
			here?

					BRODSKI
			No, just tell Waylander.  He's got the
			detonator.

	She exits.

	INT. WALKWAY "C" - CONTINUOUS

	Waylander and Janessa come rushing up the walkway, with Tsun
	and Kay-Em just a beat behind.

					JANESSA
			All set?

	Waylander nods.

					TSUNARON
			Good to go.

	They turn to cross to the BRIDGE SECTION but at that instant,
	an OMINOUS RUMBLE throws them all to the deck of the walkway.

					TSUNARON (CONT'D)
			Hold together, baby.

	They scramble up the walkway toward a DOOR connecting to the
	weapons hold.  But just as they reach it, they hear CHANG!

					JANESSA
			What the hell is that?

	ANGLE ON 

	The other end of the walkway.  The entrance from the right
	hull.  The CHANGS get louder as a silhouette emerges.  

	VARIOUS SHOTS

	of a chrome, black and leather, bio-mechanoid of body parts.

	JASON VORHEES

	steps into view.  A NEW JASON!  UBER JASON!  His vaporized
	leg and arm are now forged out of Chrome Metal melded with
	flesh.  His clothes are BLACK, no longer tattered - fitting
	much tighter to his muscular frame.

	His mask is CHROME.  We can't see them, but we just know. 
	His insides are in better shape than ever.

	He closes in.

					WAYLANDER
			Impossible!  He's dead.

					ROWAN
			I'd say he got better.

					KAY-EM 14
			He's been modified.

					JANESSA
			Ya think?

					TSUNARON
			Can you take him?

					KAY-EM 14
			I can try.

	Kay-Em pulls out her weapons.  BRRRAATT!! But it doesn't faze
	the NEW uber Jason.  SPARKS FLY as bullets bounce off his
	metal limbs. 

	Uber Jason steps up and swings a NEW, improved MACHETE.  It
	SLICES through Kay-Em's armor, removing a huge chunk of
	metal.

	Uber Jason grabs her and swings against a walkway stanchion. 
	Kay-Em does a back flip, kicking Uber Jason in the chest with
	all her android might.  But he doesn't budge.

	INT. CARGO BAY - INTERCUT

	Brodski is finishing his last charge.  He either hears the
	gunshots (choice two) or buzzes Rowan on her COMM-GEAR.

					BRODSKI
			I'm set.  On my way back.

					ROWAN
			Better hurry.

	MORE GUNSHOTS.

					BRODSKI
			What the hell's going on?

					ROWAN
			Jason Fucking Vorhees, that's what!

					BRODSKI
			Now way!

	He runs for the Weapons Hold.

	INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

	Shot of Brodski tearing down to help.

	INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

	Kay-Em runs up Uber Jason's chest and kicks him in the face. 
	It does nothing.  She backs off and unleashes all her
	firepower, creating a curtain of death in the walkway area.

	But when she's done...and the smoke clears...Uber Jason
	emerges UNHARMED.

					KAY-EM 14
			You guys might wanna run.

	BACK ON KAY-EM as --

	Uber Jason wraps his metallic hand around her throat, holding
	her tight.

					KAY-EM 14 (CONT'D)
			That the best you can do...
				(to the gang)
			Go!  GO!!!

	Uber Jason cocks a massive fist.  He punches Kay-Em in the
	face and KAY-EM'S HEAD FLIES OFF!  It rolls to a stop halfway
	between Uber Jason and where our gang is gathered by the
	door.

					TSUNARON
			Kay-Em!!!

					KAY-EM 14
			Is that it?!  Come back and fight like a
			man!

	Tsunaron rushes back to retrieve the head.

					KAY-EM 14 (CONT'D)
			Tsun!  No!!

	Tsun hurls himself along the walkway, diving for Kay-Em's
	head like a loose football.  Uber Jason raises his machete,
	about to give Tsun the death blow --

	But Rowan hurls herself RIGHT OVER TSUN, catching Uber Jason
	in the mid-section.  She doesn't take him down, but his
	machete blow falls wide.

					TSUNARON
			Rowan, what are you doing?

	Uber Jason grabs Rowan by her hair and lifts her up to eye
	level.  He pulls her close to his mask, staring at her.  Oh,
	yes, he remembers her.

	SHE SPITS IN HIS FACE!

	Once again, Uber Jason cocks his massive fist, but --

	WHAM!

	Waylander lands on Uber Jason's back, his beefy arm locked
	around Jason's neck.  Vorhees spins, dropping Rowan and
	smashing Waylander into the wall.

	Waylander still clings to Uber Jason's back, who drives into
	the walkway wall again.

	CRACK!

	Waylander let's out an agonizing howl.  He falls to the deck,
	his back broken, his legs bent under him at a sickening
	angle.  It's obvious he can't move.

					TSUNARON (CONT'D)
			Waylander!

	Jason faces our heroes.

					ROWAN
			Run!  Run!

	They dart toward the door of the weapons hold and safety.

	INT. WALKWAY AT WEAPONS' HOLD - CONTINUOUS

	Brodski flies in.  Janessa points toward the corridor and
	Uber Jason.

					JANESSA
			There...

	Rowan and Tsun (still holding Kay-Em's head) race down the
	walkway toward them.

	INT. WEAPONS HOLD - CONTINUOUS

					JANESSA
			Oh shit!  Waylander had the trigger!

	Brodski helps Rowan and Tsunaron dive under the door a split
	second before it slides shut - then --

	KA-FWAM!  Uber Jason slams into it from the other side.

					TSUNARON
			Get ready to blow the walkway!

					BRODSKI
			Waylander's got the trigger.

	Brodski looks through the viewport to see Waylander's body. 
	There's no way to get the remote.  Then --

	INT. WALKWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Waylander's head rises.  He stares right at Brodski.  He
	smiles a sad smile, then coughs.  Blood dribbles from his
	mouth.  Both know what has to happen next.

	WAYLANDER'S POV

	AS Jason pounds the door. 

					WAYLANDER
			Hey, asshole!

	Uber Jason stops pounding and turns.

	INT. WEAPONS HOLD - CONTINUOUS

					BRODSKI
			Hit the deck!

	He drags Rowan to the floor.  The others dive too.

	INT. WALKWAY - CONTINUOUS

	With one hand, Waylander FLIPS Uber Jason the bird.  With the
	other, he hits the TRIGGER.  The charges BLOW!  A fireball
	rushes toward Uber Jason!  It lifts him off his feet and
	HURLS him directly at CAMERA.

	INT. WEAPONS HOLD - CONTINUOUS

	KA-FWAM!!! An imprint of Jason's body is STAMPED into the
	door.

	EXT. GRENDEL - CONTINUOUS

	The walkways explode!  The right hull separates from the
	BRIDGE SECTION.  Vectors off a short distance, then --

	KA-FOOM!

	Grendel's RIGHT HULL EXPLODES!  They barely made it!

	INT. WEAPONS HOLD - CONTINUOUS

	The area bucks from the blast's impact.  Our heroes go
	airborne for a moment, then CRASH to the deck.

	Everybody checks their body for injury and their immediate
	surroundings for damage.  They can all breath, the hull is
	holding -- at least for the time being.

					BRODSKI
			Damage?

	Tsunaron climbs to a console.

					TSUNARON
			We're okay.  I think we're okay.

					ROWAN
			We made it?

					BRODSKI
			Maybe.

					KAY-EM 14
			I'd clap if I could.

					RESCUE VOICE (O.S.)
			Tiamat to Grendel.  Come in.

					JANESSA
				(into mic)
			We read you, Tiamat.  Our little plan
			worked.

	The kids gather around with growing excitement.

	EXT. GRENDEL BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

	The one remaining pontoon is rotating from the explosion.
	The Tiamat is near the damaged hull.

					RESCUE VOICE (O.S.)
			What the hell is going on in there?  You
			almost took us out.

	INT. TIAMAT - CONTINUOUS

	NOTE: Shoot both sides of this conversation.

					JANESSA (O.S.)
			Where are you, Tiamat?

					RESCUE PILOT
			Right next door.  We have you vectored
			for approach and emergency docking. 
			You're doing a little rocking and
			rolling out there.  So do what you can
			to hold your position.

	INT. GRENDEL BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

					JANESSA
			Like we've got a choice?

					BRODSKI
				(into mic)
			Understood, Tiamat.  Standing by.
				(to others)
			Let's head to docking.  You okay, girl?

					ROWAN
			Never better.

	Brodski likes this girl.  Tough kid.  And she likes him,
	too.

					BRODSKI
			Let's go.

	On JANESSA sitting on the bench.

					JANESSA
			It's about damn time!

	Suddenly, behind her.  WHAM!  Uber Jason's FIST BURSTS
	THROUGH the hull!

					BRODSKI
			You've got to be shitting me!

	EXT. GRENDEL BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

	Uber Jason is glued to the outside of the spacecraft and
	has punched his fist through the goddamn hull.

	INT. WEAPONS HOLD - CONTINUOUS

	Jason rips his hand back out and the vacuum starts sucking. 
	WARNING ALARMS SOUND.  A SUCKING WIND RISES.  Uber Jason rips
	a hole in the hull.  He's not finished yet.

	The VACUUM wreaks havoc in the weapons hold.  Everything not
	tied down goes shooshing out the hole.

	EXT. GRENDEL BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

	Uber Jason holds onto the ship as stuff whizzes past him.

	INT. WEAPONS HOLD - CONTINUOUS

	Fighting against the hurricane-force wind, Brodski, Tsunaron
	and Rowan reach the CORRIDOR.  The noise is deafening.

					BRODSKI
			Come on!

	Our heroes make their way through the door 
	- all but Janessa - she's in shit shape.

	JANESSA

	Crawls across the floor against the onrushing wind.  Clinging
	desperately to a section of steel grating.

					BRODSKI (CONT'D)
			JANESSA!

					JANESSA
			SHUT THE DAMN DOOR!

	A section of the steel grating TEARS FREE and goes whipping
	past her.

	THE STEEL MESH SPLATS ACROSS THE HOLE, COVERING IT WITH A
	CHEESE-GRATER PATTERN OF STEEL.

	Behind it, we see one of Uber Jason's HANDS clinging to the
	edge of the hole.

	Brodski grabs hold of the door frame and reaches out.  She's
	too far.

					ROWAN
			Here!

	Rowan takes his hand and forming a human chain, she moves
	toward Janessa, but it's too late.

	Janessa's grating tears free.

					JANESSA
			This sucks on so many levels!

	And so it does.  Janessa is JERKED FREE.  She flies PAST
	CAMERA and out the ship.

	THE OTHERS

	Look on in horror.  Brodski drags the others out into the
	corridor and shuts the door behind them.

	ON THE STEEL MESH

	As the pressure in the Weapons Hold equalizes and the wind
	dies down, we see a TATTER of flesh and hair across the steel
	mesh.  Then Uber Jason's hand grabs the grate and punches it
	in.  His other hand appears and he starts to rip steel.

	INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

	Our heroes race along the corridor, closing HATCHES behind
	them.  BOOM!  Behind them --

					ROWAN
			Oh, great!

	INT. WEAPONS HOLD - CONTINUOUS

	KA-BOOM!  Uber Jason smashes through the weapons hold door
	and steps into the corridor. 

	INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS

	Our guys race across the room into --

	INT. SHUTTLE BAY - CONTINUOUS

					BRODSKI
			Tiamat, we are at the evac door.

					RESCUE PILOT (O.S.)
			So am I, Grendel.  You ready to get off
			that boat?

					ROWAN
			We are so ready.

					BRODSKI
			That's affirmative, Tiamat!  Standing by
			for acquisition.

	EXT. GRENDEL BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

	The Tiamat is beginning to extend its EMERGENCY EVACUATION
	SLIDE.  Think of it as some sort of strong tube that will
	make a pressurized union between the two hatches.  It looks
	like a ritual mating dance between sexual space ships.  The
	Tiamat pulls close and connects.

	INT. SHUTTLE BAY - CONTINUOUS

	Bump.  Rumble.

					RESCUE PILOT (O.S.)
			Tiamat to Grendel, lifeline secured. 
			Initiate collar pressurization.

					BRODSKI
			Roger, Tiamat!  Opening under doors.

	Brodski throws the switch.  Instead of the door opening,
	there is an ugly, grinding sound.

					ROWAN
			Lemme guess, we just got another visit
			from the fuck-up fairy.

					TSUNARON
				(re: computer)
			I've got this.  Let me try an override.
				(tries some things)
			Shit shit shit shit shit shit.
				(finally)
			The exterior motor's got no power.

	Brodski has the service panel open, exposing a handful of hi
	tech laser beams and terminals.  Having looked it over, he
	knows Tsunaron's right.  There's only one thing he can do.

					BRODSKI
			Yeah.

					ROWAN
			What does that mean?

					BRODSKI
			It means I'm going EVA.
				(to Tsun)
			I can get it from outside.

					TSUNARON
			Yeah.

					ROWAN
			What does that mean?

					BRODSKI
			It means I'm going EVA.
				(to Tsun)
			I can get it from outside.

					TSUNARON
			I don't think we have time.

					BRODSKI
			We don't have a choice.
				(to Rowan)
			I'll need you here on this side.

					ROWAN
			EVA.  What's EVA?

					BRODSKI
			Spacewalk.

	Brodski exits frame to put on EVA suit.

					ROWAN
			Oh yeah, spacewalk.

					TSUNARON
			It's worth a shot.  Go.

	Brodski begins putting on his EVA suit.

					TSUNARON (CONT'D)
			If he can jump the leads out there we
			can reroute them in here. 
			Hopefully, that will open the door and
			we get off this thing before it blows
			the hell up.

					ROWAN
			Sounds like a good plan.

					TSUNARON
			Tiamat?  This is Grendel.  Our escape
			hatch's jammed.  We're going EVA to try
			to patch it up.

	INT. TIAMAT - CONTINUOUS

	Concern.

					RESCUE PILOT
			Then get a move on.  Systems show you
			are leaking serious nitro-methane.  It's
			already at 41 percent.  You get off now
			or you don't get off.

					TSUNARON (O.S.)
			We're on it, Tiamat.  Just a few more
			minutes. 

	INT. MAINTENANCE HATCH - CONTINUOUS

	Brodski steps forward in a red environment suit.

					BRODSKI
			Set.  I'm in the Maintenance Hatch.
				(pulls down visor)
			Check 1, 2, 3.

					ROWAN
			It's working.

					BRODSKI
			I'm ready.

					TSUNARON
			Then go, Sarge.

	BUMP.

					ROWAN
			Sarge...

					BRODSKI
			Yeah.

					ROWAN
			Don't fuck this up.

	They both smile.  Brodski exits.

	INT. SHUTTLE BAY - CONTINUOUS

	INSERT COMPUTER SCREEN.

	Tsun hits a button and a schematic shows up where JASON IS
	and how many hatches he's going through.  We might cut to
	this schematic from time-to-time to chart his progress.

					TSUNARON
			Those hatches aren't going to keep him
			out much longer.  You were an expert on
			this guy, right?

					ROWAN
			What are you thinking?

					TSUNARON
			Tell me everything you know about
			Crystal Lake.

	EXT. GRENDEL BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

	CGI Brodski floats around toward the evacuation slide. Gets
	in position.  He opens the side access panel.

					BRODSKI
			I'm out here, let's do this.

	INT. SHUTTLE BAY - CONTINUOUS

	Rowan crosses to the access panel from Tsunaron's side,
	wearing her comm-gear.  Kay-Em's head has been hardwired to
	the computer that Tsunaron is sitting at.

					ROWAN
			Standing by.  Over.

					BRODSKI
			Okay, I'm going to bypass the main power
			supply unit and send it to you.

					ROWAN
				(studying)
			Send it?  How will I know I got it?

					BRODSKI
			Just listen.  There's a red wire next to
			a red and blue striped conducer. 
			Disconnect it and hold it free.  Don't
			touch anything.

					ROWAN
			Got it.

					BRODSKI
			When I tell yo, attach it to the
			terminal on the lower left corner.  See
			it.  It has two yellow leads coming in.

					ROWAN
			I see them.

					BRODSKI
			Connect them and don't do anything else. 
			Until I tell you.

	BUMP.

	EXT. GRENDEL BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

	A small explosion at the front of the ship sends shrapnel
	sailing back over Brodski and the Tiamat.

	INT. SHUTTLE BAY - CONTINUOUS

	Tsunaron is over with Kay-Em, typing like crazy.

					RESCUE PILOT (O.S.)
			That was another part of your hull,
			Grendel.  You are running out of time.

					BRODSKI (O.S.)
			Just a few more minutes, Tiamat.

					TSUNARON
			We're working very hard and very fast,
			right guys?!

					RESCUE PILOT (O.S.)
			We can disengage and come around again.

					TSUNARON
			No way, Tiamat.  Just another minute.

					RESCUE PILOT (O.S.)
			We'll stand by as long as we can,
			Grendel.

	Then in the Cargo Bay, there's a loud noise.  BOOM! BOOM!

					TSUNARON
			Uh-oh.

	Then -- KA-FWAM!  Uber Jason finally steps through the
	twisted mass of metal into Cargo Bay.

	INT. SHUTTLE BAY - CONTINUOUS

	Tsun sees Jason in the Cargo Hold.

					TSUNARON
			He's here.  You ready, Kay?

					KAY-EM 14
			I was built ready, babe.

					TSUNARON
			Initiate.

	INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS

	Jason steps down into the Cargo Bay.  As he starts toward
	Tsunaron, the room blurs and shifts and becomes --

	CRYSTAL LAKE

	Almost.  Forest, cabins, the lake, all a bit distorted.

	It gets Uber Jason's attention.  At first he's confused, but
	then he's interested.

	INT. SHUTTLE BAY - CONTINUOUS

	Tsunaron watches Jason through the cabin window.

					TSUNARON
			It's working.  It's working, he's buying
			it!
				(to Computer/Kay-Em)
			Repair variations using data file
			Crystal Lake circa 1980.

	Rowan pokes her head out of the closet and looks at Crystal
	Lake.  Pretty impressive.

					ROWAN
			Wow.

	Brodski snaps her back to attention.

					BRODSKI (O.S.)
			Rowan.  Are you there?

					ROWAN
			Yes. 

					BRODSKI (O.S.)
			Now!  See the bright blue diode? 
			Connect it to the terminal.

	Rowan puts the diode to the terminal.  It sparks.  Lights dim
	as a result.

					TSUNARON
			Was that you or me?

					BRODSKI
			That's the wrong one!

					ROWAN
			Shut up!  I did what you said!

					BRODSKI
			The bright blue diode?!

	She sees that the one she had in her hands was not the
	brightest of the bunch.

					ROWAN
				(looking closely)
			Okay, it was just blue.  I've got it
			now.  Sorry.

	Tsunaron looks out the window again.

	INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS

	At that moment, Jason turns and sees Tsun.

	INT. SHUTTLE BAY - CONTINUOUS

	Tsun whips his head back.

					TSUNARON
			Ooops.

					ROWAN
			What do you mean, "oops"?

					TSUNARON
			Nothing.
				(covering)
			How's it coming with that door?

					ROWAN
			Not nothing.  You don't just say oops. 
			What?

					TSUNARON
			I think he saw me.

	Rowan looks out the window.  Sees Jason advancing.

					ROWAN
			If you got something brilliant up your
			sleeve, do it now!

	Tsun works feverishly at the console.

					TSUNARON
			I got something.  Kay?  Where are you?

					KAY-EM 14
			Searching...found, downloading.

					TSUNARON
			Initiate.

	WE HEAR the distant GIRLISH LAUGHTER.

	INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS

	Jason stops.  Turns toward the sound.  Through the bushes, he
	sees TWO TEEN GIRLS wearing only a bra and panties.  He moves
	toward them and steps into their campsite.

	INT. SHUTTLE BAY - CONTINUOUS

	Rowan smiles brightly.

					ROWAN
			That's brilliant!

					TSUNARON
				(never stopping work)
			Thank you, thank you.

					KAY-EM 14
			I think he's wonderful!

	INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS

					GIRL TEEN #1
				(offers a beer)
			Hey?  You wanna beer?

					GIRL TEEN #2
			Or do you wanna smoke pot?

					GIRL TEEN #1
			Or we can have pre-marital sex?!

					GIRL TEEN #1 &amp; #2
			We love pre-marital sex!!

	He stares from one sleeping bag to the other.  Which to do
	first?  Then he reaches down and grabs them both.  He swings
	the bags in circles over his head then slams them both into a
	TREE!  He repeats this over and over and over...

	INT. SHUTTLE BAY - CONTINUOUS

					TSUNARON
			Now why don't you get that door open? 
			Do something?

					ROWAN
				(focused)
			You do something!  We're busy here!

					BRODSKI (O.S.)
			Okay, Rowan!  Try it now!

					ROWAN
			Here we go!

	She hits the door panel.  NOTHING!  Just more grinding.

					ROWAN (CONT'D)
			Didn't work.

					BRODSKI (O.S.)
			Okay.  I'll try the other.  Stand by.

					TSUNARON
			He's done with the campers.

					KAY-EM 14
			Wow, he's good.

					TSUNARON
			Too good.  He's coming back.

					ROWAN
			We need something, Tsunaron.

					TSUNARON
			I know...ummmm...

					ROWAN
			Anything!

					TSUNARON
			Okay!  Here!

	Tsunaron stammers, he can't think of anything.  Then:

	INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS

	Jason stops short.  Looks up --

	INT. SHUTTLE BAY - CONTINUOUS

					ROWAN
			That's the beset you could come up with?

	Tsunaron shrugs.

	INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS

	There - in the middle of Crystal Lake - is a 12' TALL BUNNY
	RABBIT.  It looks at Jason and hops off.

	INT. SHUTTLE BAY - CONTINUOUS

					BRODSKI (O.S.)
			Okay!  Try it again!

	Rowan punches the door control panel.  LIGHTS GO ON!

					TSUNARON
			It's engaged, man.  The door is engaged.

					RESCUE PILOT (O.S.)
			We have lock, Grendel.  We have lock.

	And with that, SWOOSH!  The door opens revealing the Tiamat
	rescue room.  BUMP!  RUMBLE!

					TSUNARON
			Brodski, you're a GOD!

					ROWAN
			We gonna see you some time soon?

					BRODSKI (O.S.)
			I'm on my way.

	EXT. GRENDEL - CONTINUOUS

	Brodski jets back around toward the maintenance hatch.

	INT. SHUTTLE BAY - CONTINUOUS

	BUMP!  RUMBLE!

					RESCUE PILOT (O.S.)
			Come on, Grendel!  We gotta go now!

					BRODSKI
			Rowan, you and Tsunaron get on that
			ship.  If you have to leave, leave! 
			Don't wait for me.

					ROWAN
			No.

					BRODSKI
			Tsunaron, make sure she gets on that
			ship.

					TSUNARON
			I hear you, Sarge.

	INT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE SIMULATION - CONTINUOUS

	Uber Jason heads towards the cabin.

					ROWAN
			Hey, Slappy.  Yeah you!  I owe you big
			time and now it's time for payback.  You
			wanna piece of me, c'mon!

	As we know it's not a good idea to talk to Jason like that.
	He starts toward Rowan, which begins an abbreviated hide and
	seek routine through whatever woods and cover are available.

					ROWAN (CONT'D)
			C'mon.  Over here.
				(Jason starts at her)
			You know how old I am?  Four-hundred
			eighty one!  When I woke up I was
			confused.  Why was I here?  What was I
			supposed to do at my age?  Now I know. 
			To put your ass down once and for all,
			you menace to society!

	With all her might, she swings a tree branch at him.  It has
	no effect whatsoever.  She realizes her master plan didn't
	work.  She smiles - just kidding.

					ROWAN (CONT'D)
			Do you wanna have sex?  Sex with me? 
			C'mon, can you handle it?  Please,
			please, please.  I need it.  I want it. 
			Plllleeeeaaase.

	She tears off again, ducking behind a tree. 

					ROWAN (CONT'D)
			Brodski?  Where are you?

	EXT. GRENDEL - CONTINUOUS

	Brodski is busy pulling himself to the maintenance hatch.

					BRODSKI
			I'm almost at the hatch.

	INT. CRYSTAL LAKE SIMULATOR - CONTINUOUS

					ROWAN
			I don't know how much longer this is
			going to work.

	She peers out the tree and JUMPS BACK!  Jason is right there.
	Rowan keeps the tree between them.  He takes a swipe at her,
	cutting the tree in HALF!  

	Rowan looks at the trunk for a beat.  Then jumps right back
	into her tirade.

					ROWAN (CONT'D)
			Oh no, I forgot. You only do children,
			little boys.  You couldn't get it up on
			a bet, you pencil dick faggot.  Fuck
			you!

	An EXPLOSION RIPS through the Cargo Bay.

	INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS

	We see Tsunaron and Kay-Em doing whatever they can to keep
	Crystal Lake's simulation going.

	SPARKS pop from the ceiling and panels behind Tsunaron.

					RESCUE PILOT (O.S.)
			Grendel.  We can't keep pressure lock. 
			We will disengage in ninety-seconds.

					TSUNARON
			Ninety-seconds?  Copy.  You hear that,
			Brodski?

					RESCUE PILOT (O.S.)
			Time to cut your losses, Grendel.

	INT. CRYSTAL LAKE SIMULATOR - CONTINUOUS

	This is when Jason finally has Rowan cornered.  He takes a
	huge swipe at her and cuts her clean in half. Her dismembered
	half speaks, nonplussed.

					ROWAN
			Your mother sucks eggs!

	Hey!  It's VR ROWAN!

	INT. SHUTTLE BAY - CONTINUOUS

	Rowan rips off her VR gear.

					ROWAN
			Goddamn!  That's intense.

					TSUNARON
			Menace to society!?  Who writes your
			stuff?

	BUMP!  All go down, including Kay-Em's head.  Rowan struggles
	to get Tsunaron to his feet.  He's really hurt.

					RESCUE PILOT (O.S.)
			You have 40-seconds, Grendel.

					ROWAN
				(en route to hatch)
			Brodski. Come in.  Brodski.  Where the
			hell are you?

					RESCUE PILOT (O.S.)
			30-seconds.

	INT. TIAMAT - RESCUE BAY - CONTINUOUS

	Rowan drags Tsun onto Tiamat, where a RESCUE GRUNT helps her
	pull him on board.

					TSUNARON
			Kay-Em.  Please.  Kay-Em.

	Rowan is on her way back.

					ROWAN
			Brodski!  Brodski!

	INT. SHUTTLE BAY - CONTINUOUS

	He's not there and the damn ships about to leave.  She sees
	Kay-Em's head.  Sprinting, she picks it up and dashes toward
	the umbilical.

	Uber Jason walks through the cabin and, an instant later, RED
	FORM steps into frame behind him.

					RESCUE PILOT (O.S.)
			15...14...13...

					BRODSKI
			You're mine, Slappy!

					RESCUE PILOT (O.S.)
			11...10...9...

	Rowan, with Kay-Em's head, dashes through the hatch, gives
	the head to Tsun, grabs the gun from the Taimat Crew member
	and --

					RESCUE PILOT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
			5...4...3...

	Rowan is on her way back to rescue Brodski when he crosses to
	the hatch door.  Looks at Rowan then pushes the release
	switch that closes the door and disengages the Tiamat.

					ROWAN
			No!  Wait!  Please!!!

					RESCUE PILOT (O.S.)
			2...1...

	SWOOSH!  The door closes and the Tiamat is forced to
	disengage.

					RESCUE PILOT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
			Clear!  Clear!  Clear!  Disconnect!

	A RESCUE OFFICER HITS a switch and the lifeline disconnects
	from Grendel, SHRINKING to a protective membrane over the
	rescue hatch on the Tiamat.

	Through the hatch, we see Grendel starting to dwindle in the
	distance.  KAFOOM!  

	Huge CHUNKS of metallic debris spread from the blast.  One
	chunk is headed right for them.

	INT. TIAMAT - RESCUE BAY - CONTINUOUS

					TSUNARON
			Look out!

	ROWAN'S POV

	The chunk of metal unfolds.  Uber Jason's chrome face and
	outstretched arms are barrelling right for them!  If he hits
	them at this speed, it's all over.

					ROWAN
			You gotta be kidding me.

					KAY-EM 14
			He's gonna hit!

	EXT. TIAMAT - CONTINUOUS

	KAFWAM!  Brodski slams into Uber Jason head on, knocking him
	off-course.  

					ROWAN
			Brodski!

	Brodski and Uber Jason tumble end-over-end in space, trying
	to land blows on each other.  Finally, Brodski gets position
	on Uber Jason's back and starts slamming his fists into the
	back of Jason's head.

					BRODSKI (O.S.)
			How about some of this, you mask-wearing
			machete-wielding sumbitch!

	A JET FLAME shoots out from the EVA SUIT.  Brodski and Jason
	disappear toward Earth Two.

	INT. TIAMAT - RESCUE BAY - CONTINUOUS

	They watch Brodski and Uber Jason get smaller and smaller,
	vanishing out of sight.

					TSUNARON
			He's gone.

					ROWAN
			I can't believe it.

					KAY-EM 14
			Tsun?

	Kay-Em's head sits on the floor in the back of the rescue
	bay.

					TSUNARON
			Kay-Em!  You okay?

	She stares up with big, emotional eyes.

					KAY-EM 14
			I'll be back on my feet in no time -- as
			soon as I have some.

					TSUNARON
			I'll get right on it.

					KAY-EM 14
			Good, because I think...

					TSUNARON
			Yes?

					KAY-EM 14
			I think I'm horny.

	ROWAN

	Stares out a porthole toward Earth Two.  Tsunaron approaches
	with Kay-Em.

					ROWAN
			It's beautiful.
				(turns to Tsun)
			You think I'll fit in?

					TSUNARON
			I know you'll fit in.  If you want you
			can crash on my couch for a week or two. 
			Until you find a place of your own.

					ROWAN
			Uh, thanks, Tsun.

					TSUNARON
			I want to introduce you to my brother.

					ROWAN
			He anything like you?

					TSUNARON
				(thinks)
			Not really.

					ROWAN
			He sounds nice.

	They share a laugh as we --

	EXT. EARTH TWO - CONTINUOUS

	UBER JASON and BRODSKI race toward camera.  WHIP FOLLOW as
	they scream past.



	CLOSE ON UBER JASON'S FACE

	Brodski on his back beating him still as they are enveloped
	by the friction field.

	THEY ENTER ATMOSPHERE

	A comet made of warriors blaze toward EARTH II.

	EXT. CAMPSITE - EARTH TWO - DUSK

	Mom, Dad and several kids sit on futuristic sleeping bags
	around a fire.

					KID #1
			Hey!  Check that out!

	They look up and see a shooting star whiz across and EXPLODE!
	One CHUNK separates from the rest and plummets straight
	toward them.

					KID #2
			A shooting star!

					KID #3
			Awesome!

	The glowing chunk slams into the lake.

					KID #2
			Let's go see!

					KID #1
			Can we, Daddy?

					DAD
			Sure, why not?
				(musing)
			What harm could it do?

	He puts his arm around his wife.  They smile indulgently.

	EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

	The chunk hits the water with a SIZZLING HISS.

	INT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

	CLOSE ON CHROME MASK

	As it drifts slowly down and settles on the lake bed...


			FADE OUT.
