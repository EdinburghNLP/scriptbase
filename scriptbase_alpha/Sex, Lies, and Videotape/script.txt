          1    EXT. HIGHWAY -- DAY
          
               GRAHAM DALTON, twenty-nine, drives his '69 Cutlass while smoking 
               a cigarette. One could describe his appearance as punk/arty, 
               but neither would do him justice. He is a man of obvious 
               intelligence, and his face is amiable. There is only one key 
               on his keyring, and it is in the ignition.

                         Garbage. I started thinking about 
                         what happens to all the garbage. 
                         I mean, where do we put all of 
                         it, we have to run out of places 
                         to put it eventually, don't we? 
                         This happened to me before when 
                         that barge with all the garbage 
                         was stranded and nobody would take 
                         it? Remember that?

               ANN BISHOP MILLANEY, twenty-six, sits opposite her therapist.
               She is an extremely attractive woman, dressed in a mature preppy 
               style. There is a wedding ring on her left hand.
          
                                   DOCTOR
                         Yes, I remember. What do you do 
                         when these moods overtake you?
          
                                   ANN
                         Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try 
                         not to do anything that will 
                         produce garbage, so obviously we're 
                         talking about eating and basic 
                         stuff like that. Did you know that 
                         the average person produces three 
                         pounds of garbage a day?

                         No, I didn't.

                         Don't you think that's a lot of 
                         garbage? I'd really like to know 
                         where it's all going to go.
          
                                   DOCTOR
                         Do you have any idea what triggered 
                         this concern?

                         Well, this weekend John was taking 
                         out the garbage, and he kept 
                         spilling things out of the 
                         container, and I started imagining 
                         a container that grew garbage, 
                         like it just kept filling up and 
                         overflowing all by itself, and 
                         how could you stop that if it 
                         started happening?
          
                                   DOCTOR

                                   DOCTOR
                         Well, last week we talked about 
                         your obsession with the families 
                         of airline fatalities, and now 
                         we're talking about your concern 
                         over the garbage problem.

                                   DOCTOR
                         If you think about it, I think 
                         you'll see that the object of your 
                         obsession is invariably something 
                         negative that you couldn't possibly 
                         have any control over.
          
                                   ANN
                         Well, do you think many people 
                         run around thinking about how happy 
                         they feel and how great things 
                         are? I mean, maybe they do, but 
                         I doubt those people are in 
                         therapy. Besides, being happy isn't 
                         all that great. My figure is always 
                         at its best when I'm depressed. 
                         The last time I was really happy 
                         I put on twenty-five pounds. I 
                         thought John was going to have 
                         a stroke.

               JOHN MILLANEY, twenty-nine, sits at his desk talking on the
               telephone. He is dressed very well, sporting real suspenders 
               with his striped pinpoint oxford shirt and cotton suit. He 
               fingers the wedding ring on his left hand.
          
                                   JOHN
                         As soon as you've got a ring on 
                         your finger, you start getting 
                         serious attention from the opposite 
                         gender. Seriously, I wish I had 
                         Super Bowl seats for every time 
                         I had some filly just come up 
                         and start talking to me without 
                         the slightest provocation. That 
                         never happened before I got 
                         married. Shit, if I'd known that, 
                         I'd have gone out and bought me 
                         a ring when I was eighteen and 
                         saved myself a lot of time and 
                         money.
          
               John looks at his watch.
          
                                   JOHN

                         Are you afraid of his reaction?

                         him about the garbage thing because 
                         I'm pissed off at him right now. 
                         He's letting some old college buddy 
                         stay at our house for a couple 
                         of days, and he didn't even ask 
                         me about it. I mean, I would've 
                         said yes, I just wish he would've 
                         asked.

               to disrobe. Cynthia bears a slight resemblance to Ann, but 
               is not as overtly attractive. She does, however, have a definite 
               carnal appeal and air of confidence that Ann lacks.

                         it and everything, it just does't 
                         freak me out, I wouldn't miss it,

                         haven't been doing anything at 
                         all. Like I said, it's not that 
                         I miss it, but I m curious the 
                         way things kind of slacked off 
                         all of a sudden.

                         Perhaps he senses your hesitance 
                         at being touched.

                         that feeling, that's why it seems 
                         weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he 
                         wishes I would initiate things 
                         once in awhile, and I would 
                         except it never occurs to me, I'm 
                         always thinking about something 
                         else and then the few times that I

                              (slightly uncomfortable) 
                         Well, I kind of tried once. It 
                         just seemed stupid, I kept seeing 
                         myself lying there and it seemed 
                         stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't 
                         know, and then I was wondering 
                         if my dead grandfather could see 
                         me doing this, and it just seemed 
                         like a dumb thing to be doing when 
                         we don't know what to do with all 
                         that garbage, you know?

                         So it was recently that you tried 
                         this.

                         Well, kind of recently, I guess. 
                         But not too recently.
          
               There is a pause.

                         I'm really not up to having a guest 
                         in the house.
          
          8    INT. CYNTHIA BISHOP'S APARTMENT -- DAY
          
               John and Cynthia are lying in bed, bathed in sweat.
          
                                   JOHN
                         I've got to get back to the office.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         I only get one today? Gee, how 
                         exciting.
          
               John rolls over and begins to put his clothes on.
          
                                   JOHN
                         I can't let my lunch hour go on 
                         too long. I've already skipped 
                         one meeting.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Don't give me this 
                         passive/aggressive bullshit. If 
                         you want to leave, leave. My life 
                         doesn't stop when you walk out the 
                         door, you know what I'm saying?
          
               John shakes his head.
          
                                   JOHN
                         Why don't you just tell me how
                         you really feel?
          
               John stands and begins putting on his clothes.
          
                                   JOHN
                         I have a friend coming in from 
                         out of town, I'll probably be 
                         spending some time with him the 
                         next couple of days.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Meaning we'll have to cool it for
                         awhile, right?
          
                                   JOHN
                         Right.
          
               A silent shrug from Cynthia. John is almost completely dressed.
          
                                   JOHN
                         I wish you'd quit that bartending
                         job.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Why?
          
                                   JOHN
                         I hate the thought of guys hitting
                         on you all the time.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         I can handle it. Besides, the money 
                         is good and some of the guys are 
                         cute. And you are in no position 
                         to be jealous.
          
                                   JOHN
                         Who said I was jealous?
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         I did.
          
               John says nothing.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         You know, I'd like to try your 
                         house sometime. The idea of doing 
                         it in my sister's bed gives me 
                         a perverse thrill.
          
               John thinks about that.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         I wish I could tell everybody that 
                         Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, 
                         popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.
          
                                   JOHN
                         Could be risky.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Well, maybe I could just start 
                         a rumor, then.
          
                                   JOHN
                         No, I mean doing it at my house.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Afraid of getting caught?
          
                                   JOHN
                         Maybe.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         You should be. Can I meet this 
                         friend of yours?
          
                                   JOHN
                         Cynthia, I don't think you want 
                         to, I mean, you should see the 
                         way he dresses. I really think 
                         he's in a bad way.
          
                                   CYNTHIA 
                         I'm intrigued.
          
                                   JOHN 
                         You're intrigued?
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Sure. Maybe he's the man I'm 
                         looking for. Then I won't have 
                         to fuck worried husbands all the 
                         time.
          
               John looks at her for a moment before heading for the door.
          
                                   JOHN
                         Bye.
          
          9   EXT. JOHN AND ANN MILLANEY'S HOUSE -- DAY
          
               Graham has parked in the Millaney's driveway. He opens the 
               trunk, revealing a Sony 8mm Video rig and a single black duffle 
               bag. He grabs the duffle bag and shuts the trunk.
          
               Graham knocks at the door. He is stubbing out a cigarette with 
               his beaten tennis shoe when Ann answers the door. She is unable 
               to hide her suprise at his appearance.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Ann?
          
                                   ANN
                         Yes?
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         (extends his hand) 
                         Graham Dalton.
          
               Ann shakes his hand.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Can I use your bathroom?
          
               Ann withdraws her hand.
          
                                   ANN
                         Yes. Yes, come in, please.
          
               Graham moves inside.
          
          10   INT. JOHN AND ANN MILLANEY'S HOUSE -- DAY
          
               Ann closes the door and motions Graham to the rear of the house.
          
                                   ANN
                         Straight back, first door on the 
                         left.
          
               Graham heads for the bathroom. Ann heads for the phone. She 
               dials John's office.
          
                                   VOICE ON PHONE 
                         Forman, Brent, and Millaney.
          
                                   ANN
                         John Millaney, please. This is 
                         his wife.
          
               Graham exits the bathroom. Ann quickly hangs up the phone.
          
                                   ANN 
                         That was quick.
          
                                   GRAHAM 
                         False alarm.
          
                                   ANN
                         Oh. Well, please sit down.
          
               Graham sits, his manner pleasantly animated. He gets his Gitanes 
               from inside his scuffed black leather jacket and looks around 
               for an ashtray. Ann swallows uncomfortably.
          
                                   ANN
                         We...don't usually let people smoke 
                         in the house. We have a patio if you --
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Oh, no problem. It can wait.
          
               A moment of silence. Graham looks at Ann directly. It is not 
               a challenging stare, he's just trying to ascertain what kind 
               of person she is. Ann, to her credit, somehow meets his gaze. 
               Something subtle passes between them.
          
                                   ANN
                              (looks at duffle bag) 
                         Do you have other things?
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Yes.
                                   (pause)
                         Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, 
                         I have some other things, no, I 
                         don't need to bring them in. This 
                         is all I need to stay here.
          
                                   ANN
                         Oh.
          
               Graham smiles. He has an unusual face, a face that fluctuates 
               between remarkably handsome and just plain strange.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Have you ever been on television?

                                   GRAHAM
                         Yes.
          
                                   ANN
                         No. Why?
          
                                   GRAHAM
                              (shrugs) 
                         Curious.
          
               The central air-conditioning switches on. Ann smiles.
          
                                   ANN
                         Graham is an unusual name.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Yeah, I guess it is. My mother 
                         is a complete Anglophile, anything 
                         British makes her drool like a 
                         baby. She probably heard the name 
                         in some movie. She's a prisoner 
                         of public television now.

                         Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable 
                         with my appearance. I feel a little 
                         out of place in these surroundings.

                         I used to take great pleasure in 
                         that, being purposefully different, 
                         rubbing people's noses in it. 
                         Didn't you do that when you were 
                         younger?

                         Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band 
                         once, and the music was always 
                         secondary to just flat out 
                         offending as many people as 
                         possible.

                         stability. Like things are going 
                         to last awhile.

                         Oh, definitely. I mean, just this 
                         past year has gone by like phew! 
                         I hardly even knew it passed.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Did you know that if you shut 
                         someone up in a room, and the only 
                         clock he has reference to runs 
                         two hours slow for every 
                         twenty-four, that his body will 
                         eventually adjust to that schedule? 
                         Simply because the mind honestly 
                         perceives that twenty-six hours 
                         are twenty-four, the body follows.
                         And then there are sections of time. 
                         Your life can be broken down into 
                         the sections of time that formed 
                         your personality (if you have one). 
                         For instance, when I was twelve,
                         I had an eleven minute conversation 
                         with my father that to this day 
                         defines our relationship. Now, 
                         I'm not saying that everything 
                         happened in that specific section 
                         of time, but the events of my 
                         childhood involving my father led 
                         up to, and then were crystallized 
                         in, that eleven minutes.
          
               Ann is fascinated, if a bit overwhelmed.

                         Anyway, I think the mind is very 
                         flexible as far as time is 
                         concerned.

                         Exactly. I would say the fact that 
                         you feel the first year of your 
                         marriage has gone by quickly means 
                         lots of things. Or could mean lots 
                         of things.

                         boring. But, up until I dropped

                         alike.

                         of you seem so different.

                         I would imagine that we are, now. 
                         I think I'm ready to use the 
                         bathroom, finally.
          
               Graham gets up and heads for the toilet. Ann watches him go,
               a bemused smile on her face. After she hears the door close, 
               she can't resist the impulse to take a closer look at Graham's 
               bag.

                                   JOHN
                         Girl Graham dated. Still lives 
                         here, far as I know.
          
               Graham eats in silence.

                         Graham and I were talking about 
                         apartments and I told him to check 
                         the Garden District, there are 
                         some nice little places there, 
                         garage apartments and stuff.
          
                                   JOHN
                              (to Graham)
                         Stay away from the Garden District. 
                         Serious crime. I don't know what 
                         kind of place you're looking for, 
                         but there are a lot of studio-type 
                         apartments available elsewhere.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         I wish I didn't have to live 
                         someplace.
          
                                   JOHN
                              (laughs) 
                         What do you mean?
          
               Graham thinks a moment, then puts his keyring with its single 
               key onto the table.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Well, see, right now I have this 
                         one key, and I really like that. 
                         Everything I own is in my car. 
                         If I get an apartment, that's two 
                         keys. If I get a job, maybe I 
                         have to open and close once in 
                         awhile, that's more keys. Or I 
                         buy some stuff and I m worried 
                         about getting ripped off, so I 
                         get some locks, and that's more 
                         keys. I just really like having 
                         the one key. It's clean, you know?
          
               Graham looks at the keyring before returning it to his pocket.
          
                                   JOHN
                         Get rid of the car when you get 
                         your apartment, then you'll still 
                         have one key.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         I like having the car, the car 
                         is important.
          
                                   JOHN
                         Especially if you want to leave 
                         someplace in a hurry.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Or go someplace in a hurry.
          
               Ann takes her plate into the kitchen.
          
                                   JOHN
                              (smiles at Graham) 
                         Do you pay taxes?
          
               Graham also stands, empty plate in hand.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Do I pay taxes? Of course I pay 
                         taxes, only a liar doesn't pay 
                         taxes, I'm not a liar. A liar is 
                         the second lowest form of human 
                         being.
          
                                   ANN
                              (from the kitchen) 
                         What's the first?

               John smiles, thinking. Graham follows Ann into the kitchen. 
               John shouts after them.
          
                                   JOHN
                         Hey, Ann, why don't you go with 
                         Graham to hunt for apartments? 
                         Show him how the city has changed.
          
               Ann looks at Graham.
          
                                   ANN 
                         Would you mind?
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         No.

                         Okay, I will!!
          
               John, sitting at the table and now toying with his keyring, 
               nods.
          
          12   INT. JOHN AND ANN MILLANEY'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
          
               Everyone but Ann is asleep. She gets up from her bed and sneaks 
               quietly into the guest bedroom where Graham is staying. She 
               walks cautiously up to his bed to watch him as he sleeps. 
               Moonlight caresses his face as he breathes peacefully. Exhaling, 
               he turns over slowly, his back to Ann.
          
               She picks up his jacket from beside the bed and feels the 
               surface. She brings the jacket to her nose, inhaling his 
               presence. She then sets the jacket down.
          
          13   INT. CYNTHIA BISHOP'S APARTMENT -- DAY
          
               The phone rings. Cynthia answers.
          
                                   CYNTHIA

                         in exactly one hour.

          14   INT. VACANT APARTMENT-DAY
          
               Graham and Ann walk around the room, their footfalls heavy on 
               the hardwood floors. MR. MILLER, the landlord, stands nearby. 
               He looks fairly interested in Ann.
          
                                   MR. MILLER
                         Plenty of room for two people.
          
                                   GRAHAM 
                         It'll just be me.
          
                                   MR. MILLER
                         Student?
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         No.
                                   (pause)
                         You said three-fifty?
          
                                   MR. MILLER
                         Plus first and last month deposit.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Will you lease month-to-month?
          
                                   MR. MILLER
                         Not for three-fifty.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         How about for five hundred?
          
               Mr. Miller looks at Ann, then back at Graham.
          
                                   MR. MILLER
                         That I can do.
          
          15   INT. JOHN AND ANN MILLANEY'S HOUSE -- DAY
          
               Cynthia lets herself in. She looks around.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         John?
          
                                   JOHN
                              (offscreen)
                         In here!!
          
               Cynthia walks to the bedroom, where John lies naked on the bed.
               She smiles, kicking off her shoes.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Ain't you a picture.
          
               Cynthia begins taking her clothes off. She places her diamond
               stud earring in her jacket pocket, and then drops the jacket
               on the floor. She moves onto the bed with John.

                         because you know John, but he
                         confuses me sometimes.
          
                                   GRAHAM

          16   INT. CAFÉ - DAY
          
               Graham and Ann are having lunch. Ann looks to have had a lot
               of wine. Graham drinks club soda with a twist.
          
                                   ANN
                         It's hard to explain. It's like...
                         John treats everybody the same,
                         you know? I mean, he acts just
                         as excited about seeing somebody
                         he hardly knows as he does when
                         he sees me. And so I feel like,
                         what's different about me, if I'm
                         treated exactly the same as some
                         acquaintance? If I don't like
                         somebody, I don't act like I do.
                         I guess that's why a lot of people
                         think I'm a bitch.
          
               She takes a sip of wine.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not
                         saying I know people think you're
                         a bitch, I'm saying I know what
                         you mean. And I don't even know
                         that people think you're a bitch.
                         Do they?

                         I wouldn't pay much attention.
          
               Ann smiles.

                         connection with very many people,
                         so I don't waste time with people
                         I don't feel one with.

                         I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't,

                         if you tell me something personal,
                         I might do the same.

                         Okay. I think...I think sex is
                         overrated. I think people place
                         way too much importance on it.
                         And I think that stuff about women
                         wanting it just as bad is crap.
                         I m not saying women don't want
                         it, I just don't think they want
                         it for the reason men think they
                         do.

                         I think so. I remember reading
                         somewhere that men learn to love
                         what they're attracted to, whereas
                         women become more and more

                         to have a conversation with. I'm
                         just tired of talking to other
                         couples about whether or not
                         they're going to buy the station
                         wagon, you know? It's just boring.
                         I don't know, he was just
                         different. And he's really on about
                         truth a lot, being honest, and
                         I like that, I felt comfortable
                         around him.
                              (pause)
                         After he left I had a dream that
                         he signed a lease to rent our guest
                         room.

                                   DOCTOR
                         I'm glad you feel that way, because
                         I feel that way, too.
          
                                   ANN
                         But you don't have hidden motives
                         for feeling that way, right?
          
               The Doctor laughs. Ann does not laugh with him.
          
          21   INT. GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -- DAY
          
               On a television monitor we see images originating from an 8mm
               Video deck. Graham sits naked in a sheet-covered chair facing
               the screen. He watches the tape, which is footage of himself
               interviewing a girl about her sexual preferences. The
               photography on the tape is handheld, relentless. As the
               questions get more detailed, Graham becomes more aroused.
          
               There is a knock on Graham's door. He calmly shuts off the
               videotape player and stands, wrapping the sheet around himself.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         It's open.
          
               Graham walks into the bedroom to put on some clothes. Ann opens
               the door and walks into the apartment.

                              (Off)
                         Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm
                         sort of cultivating a minimalist
                         vibe.

                         Somehow I imagined books. I thought
                         you would have like a whole lot
                         of books and be reading all the
                         time.
          
               Graham enters.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         I do read a lot. But I check
                         everything out of the library.
          
               Graham picks up an Anais Nin diary and opens it to show Ann
               the library sleeve inside.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Cheaper that way. And cuts down
                         on the clutter.
          
               Ann walks to the table where the video gear is set up. Graham
               watches her closely. She looks into a large box of 8mm
               videotapes. On the side of each tape is a label. The labels
               look like this:
          
                         DONNA / 11 DEC 86 / 1:07:36
          
               And so on. There are thirty or forty tapes, total.

               Ann hangs up.
          
          23   INT. CYNTHIA BISHOP'S APARTMENT -- DAY
          
               Cynthia gets out of the shower. The phone rings. She wraps
               herself in a towel and lifts the receiver.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Hello.
          
                                   JOHN
                         Cynthia. John.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Not today. I've got other plans.
          
                                   JOHN
                         Oh.
                              (pause)
                         Well, when, then?
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         How about inviting me over to
                         dinner?
          
                                   JOHN
                         You know what I mean.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Yeah, I know what you mean.
          
               Cynthia hangs up the phone.
          
          24   INT. GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -- DAY
          
               Graham sits smoking a cigarette. There is a knock at his door.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         It's open.
          
               Cynthia enters. Graham looks up at her.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Who are you?
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         I'm Cynthia Bishop.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Do I know you?
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         The extrovert.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                              (smiles)
                         She must have been in a good mood
                         when she said that. She usually
                         calls me loud.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         She called you that, too. May I
                         ask why you re here?
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         You want me to leave?
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         I just want to know why you're
                         here.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Well, like I said, Ann is my
                         sister. Sisters talk. You can
                         imagine the rest.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         No, I really can't. I find it
                         healthy never to characterize
                         people I don't know or
                         conversations I haven't heard.
                         I don't know what you and your
                         sister discussed about me or
                         anything else. Last time I saw
                         Ann she left here very...confused,
                         I would say. And upset.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         She still is.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         And are you here to berate me for
                         making her that way?
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Nope.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         She didn't tell you why she was
                         upset?
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Nope.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         She didn't give you my address?
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Nope.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         How did you find me?
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         I, uh, know a guy at the power
                         company.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         I don't understand. Why did you
                         want to come here? I mean, I can't
                         imagine Ann painted a very
                         flattering portrait of me.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Well, I don't really listen to
                         her when it comes to men. I mean,
                         look at John, for crissake. Oh,
                         you went to school with him didn't
                         you? You're probably friends or
                         something.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Nope. I think the man is a liar.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                              (smiles)
                         I think you're right. So come on,
                         I came all the way over here to
                         find out what got Ann so spooked,
                         tell me what happened.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                              (smiles)
                         Spooked.
          
               He motions to the box of videotapes.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         That box of tapes is what got Ann
                         so "spooked".
          
               Cynthia goes over to the box and looks inside for a long moment,
               studying the labels.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Oh, okay. I think I get it.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         What do you get?
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Well, they must be something
                         sexual, because Ann gets freaked
                         out by that shit. Are these tapes
                         of you having sex with these girls
                         or something?
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Not exactly.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Well, either you are or you aren't.
                         Which is it?
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Why don't you let me tape you?
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Doing what?
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Talking.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         About what?
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Sex. Your sexual history, your
                         sexual preferences.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         What makes you think I'd discuss
                         that with you?
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Nothing.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         You just want to ask me questions?
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         I just want to ask you questions.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         And that's all?
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         That's all.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                              (a crooked smile)
                         Is this how you get off or
                         something? Taping women talking
                         about their sexual experiences?
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Yes.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Would anybody else see the tape?
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Absolutely not. They are for my
                         private use only.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         How do we start?
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         I turn on the camera. You start
                         talking.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         And you ask questions, right?
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Yes.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         How long will it take?
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         That depends on you. One woman
                         only used three minutes. Another
                         filled up three two hour tapes.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Can I see some of the other tapes
                         to get an idea of what--
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         No.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                              (thinks)
                         Do I sit or stand?
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Whichever you prefer.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Just a moment.
          
               Graham grabs his 8mm Video camera, puts in a new tape, and turns
               it on.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         I am now recording. Tell me your
                         name.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Describe for me your first sexual
                         experience.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         My first sexual experience or the
                         first time I had intercourse?
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Your first sexual experience.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                              (thinks)
                         I was...eight years old. Michael
                         Green, who was also eight, asked
                         if he could watch me take a pee.
                         I said he could if I could watch
                         him take one, too. He said okay,
                         and then we went into the woods
                         behind our house. I got this
                         feeling he was chickening out
                         because he kept saying, "Ladies
                         first!" So I pulled down my
                         underpants and urinated, and he
                         ran away before I even finished.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Was it ever a topic of conversation
                         between the two of you afterward?
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         No. He kind of avoided me for the
                         rest of the summer, and then his
                         family moved away. To Cleveland,
                         actually.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         How unfortunate. So when did you
                         finally get to see a penis?
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         When I was fourteen.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Live, or in a photograph or film
                         of some sort?
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Very much live.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         What did you think? Did it look
                         like you expected?
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Not really. I didn't picture it
                         with veins or ridges or anything,
                         I thought it would be smooth, like
                         a test tube.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Were you disappointed?
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         No. If anything, after I looked
                         at it awhile, it got more
                         interesting. It had character,
                         you know?
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         What about when you touched it?
                         What did you expect it to feel
                         like, and then what did it really
                         feel like?
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         It was warmer than I thought it
                         would be, and the skin was softer
                         than it looked. It's weird.
                         Thinking about it now, the organ
                         itself seemed like a separate
                         thing, a separate entity to me.
                         I mean, after he pulled it out
                         and I could look at it and touch
                         it, I completely forgot that there
                         was a guy attached to it. I
                         remember literally being startled
                         when the guy spoke to me.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         What did he say?
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         He said that my hand felt good.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Then what happened?
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Then I started moving my hand,
                         and then he stopped talking.

               Cynthia, adjusting her clothes, opens the door to leave. She
               looks very aroused. She and Graham do not speak or touch.

                                   JOHN
                         Jesus, I don't know if I can get
                         away. I've got a client waiting.
                         I'd have to do some heavy duty
                         juggling.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Then get those balls in the air
                         and get your butt over here.
          
               She hangs up. John thinks a moment, then hits his intercom
               button.

                         John doesn't have sex with Ann
                         anymore.

               Cynthia has an intense orgasm. She rolls off of John, sweating.

               A moment of silence. John is starting to put his clothes on.
               Cynthia lies in bed, her eyes closed, her face serene.

                         what's the big damn deal? I mean,

               Ann looks over at John. She slowly reaches under the covers
               and grasps his penis. Without waking, he rolls over and turns
               his back to her. She returns to looking at the ceiling.

                                   GRAHAM
                         It s open.
          
               Cynthia enters the room, looking very intent on something.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Hello.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Hi.
          
               Graham sets his book down. He looks at her for a moment, then
               drags on his cigarette.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Look, I'm just going to come right
                         out and tell you why I'm here,
                         okay?
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Okay.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         I'd like to make another tape.
          
               Graham thinks for a moment.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         No.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         No? Not even one more?
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         I never do more than one. I'm
                         sorry.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         I can't talk you into it?
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         No. You'll have to get somebody
                         else.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Now who the hell is going to do
                         that for me?
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         I'm sure a substantial number of
                         men in this town would volunteer.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         But I want you to do it, I want
                         somebody who will ask the right
                         questions and everything, somebody
                         I can play to and feel safe because
                         you can't do anything.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Ouch. Okay, I deserved that.
                         Cynthia, don't you understand?
                         After the first time it's just
                         not spontaneous. There's no edge
                         anymore. Look at the tapes, there
                         is only one date on each label.
                         I have never taped anyone twice.
          
                              CYNTHIA
                         So make an exception.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         No.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         How about if you record over the
                         one we already made? You could
                         have the same date and not use
                         another tape. Who would know?
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         I would.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Well, what the hell am I supposed
                         to do?
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Cynthia, I don't know.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         I can't believe you're doing this
                         after I let you tape me.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         I'm sorry. I can't do it.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         No.
          
               Cynthia heads for the tape box. Graham leaps up to stop her.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                              (digging through the
                              box)
                         It's my fucking tape, you asshole--
          
               Graham grabs her wrists momentarily.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                              (heated)
                         No!! I told you what the parameters
                         were and you agreed. It's my tape.
                         I look at it, I touch it, nobody
                         else.
          
               Cynthia and Graham look at each other for a long moment.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Please go, I'd like you to go now.
          
               Cynthia looks at him.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Sure, okay.
          
               She leaves.

               John and Ann lie in bed. The lights are out. Ann is wide awake,
               while John is on the verge of sleep. He rolls over and puts his
               arm around her. She gets up and sits in a chair opposite the
               bed.

                         I called you Tuesday at 3:30 and
                         they said you weren't in. Do you
                         remember where you were?

               John and Cynthia are in Cynthia's bed, kissing. On the floor,
               John's watch reads 3:11 pm.

                         Tuesday. I had a late lunch.

               Ann as he steps through the front door.

                         Then maybe I saw an old message.

                         make love for the first time in

                         want to make love. I could have

                         Kirkland thing, it's my first big
                         case as junior partner, and I work
                         all day, I come home, I look
                         forward to seeing you, and...it
                         hurts that you accuse me like that.
          
               A pause. Ann exhales.
          
                                   ANN
                         I'm sorry, too. I...I get these
                         ideas in my head, you know, and
                         I have nothing to do all day but
                         sit around and concoct these
                         intricate scenarios. And then
                         I want to believe it so I don't
                         think I've wasted the whole day.
                         Last week I was convinced you were
                         having an affair with Cynthia,
                         I don't know why.
          
                                   JOHN
                         I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia,
                         of all people. She's so...
          
                                   ANN
                         Loud.
          
                                   JOHN
                         Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
          
                                   ANN
                         I didn't say it was rational, I
                         just said I was convinced.
          
                                   JOHN
                         Isn't therapy helping at all?
          
                                   ANN
                         I don't know. Sometimes I feel
                         stupid babbling about my little
                         problems while children are
                         starving in the world.
          
                                   JOHN
                         Quitting your therapy won't feed
                         the children of Ethiopia.
          
                                   ANN
                         I know.
          
               A pause.
          
                                   ANN
                         You never used to say "fucking".
          
          40   SCENE DELETED
          
          41   INT. CYNTHIA BISHOP'S APARTMENT -- DAY
          
               John sits on the edge of Cynthia's bed, slowly undressing.
          
                                   JOHN
                         It's just so blatantly stupid,
                         I have a hard time believing you
                         did it.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         What's so stupid about it?
          
                                   JOHN
                         That you...you don't even know
                         the guy.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Well, you know him, he's a friend
                         of yours, do you think he can be
                         trusted?
          
                                   JOHN
                         Shit, after what you've told me,
                         I don't know. I should've known,
                         when he showed up dressed like
                         some arty brat.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         I like the way he dresses.
          
                                   JOHN
                         What if this tape gets into the
                         wrong hands?
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         "The wrong hands"? We're not
                         talking about military secrets,
                         John. They're just tapes that he
                         makes so he can sit around and
                         get off.
          
                                   JOHN
                         Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have
                         sex with any of them? They just
                         talk?
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Right.
          
                                   JOHN
                         Jesus. I could almost understand
                         it if he was screwing these people,
                         almost. Why doesn't he just buy
                         some magazines or porno movies
                         or something?
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Doesn't work. He has to know the
                         people, he has to be able to
                         interact with them.
          
                                   JOHN
                         Interact, fine, but did you have
                         to masturbate in front of him,
                         for God's sake? I mean...
          
               A pause.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         I felt like it, so what? Goddam,
                         you and Ann make such a big deal
                         out of it.
          
                                   JOHN
                         You told Ann about this?
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Of course. She is my sister. I
                         tell her almost everything.
          
                                   JOHN
                         I wish you hadn't done that.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Why not?
          
                                   JOHN
                         It's just something I'd prefer
                         she didn't know about.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         She's a grown-up, she can handle
                         it.
          
                                   JOHN
                         I just...Ann is very...
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Hung up.
          
                                   JOHN
                         It just wasn't a smart thing to
                         do. Did you sign any sort of
                         paper, or did he have any contract
                         with you saying he wouldn't
                         broadcast these tapes?
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         No.
          
                                   JOHN
                         You realize you have no recourse
                         legally? This stuff could show
                         up anywhere.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         It won't. I trust him.
          
                                   JOHN
                              (disbelieving)
                         You trust him.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more
                         than I trust you.
          
                                   JOHN
                         What do you mean?
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Exactly what I said. I'd trust
                         him before I'd trust you. How much
                         clearer can I be?
          
                                   JOHN
                         It hurts that you would say that
                         to me.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                              (laughs)
                         Oh, please. Come on, John. You're
                         fucking your wife's sister and
                         you hardly been married a year.
                         You're a liar. But at least I know
                         you're a liar. It's the people that 
                         don't know, like Ann, that have to 
                         watch out.
          
                                   JOHN
                         By definition you're lying to Ann,
                         too.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         That's right. But I never took
                         a vow in front of God and everybody
                         to be "faithful" to my sister.
          
                                   JOHN
                         Look, are we going to do it or
                         not?
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Actually, no, I've changed my mind.
                         I shouldn't have called.
          
                                   JOHN
                              (ingratiating)
                         Well, I'm here now. I'd like to
                         do something...
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         How about straightening up the
                         living room?
          
               John doesn't smile.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Come on, John. You should be happy,
                         we've gone this far without Ann
                         finding out, I'm making it real
                         easy on you. Just walk out of here
                         and I'll see you at your house
                         for a family dinner sometime.
          
                                   JOHN
                         Did he put you up to this?
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Who?
          
                                   JOHN
                         Graham.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         No, he didn't put me up to this.
                         Jesus, I don't need people to tell
                         me what I should do. I've just
                         been thinking about things, that's
                         all.
          
                                   JOHN
                         I can't believe I let him stay
                         in my house. Right under my nose.
                         That deviant fucker was right under
                         my nose and I didn't see him.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         If he had been under your prick
                         you'd have spotted him for sure.
          
                                   JOHN
                              (looks at her)
                         God, you...you're mean.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         I know. Will you please leave now?
          
                                   JOHN
                         Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe
                         I want to talk.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         John, we have nothing to talk
                         about.
          
                                   JOHN
                         I knew it, I knew it. Things are
                         getting complicated.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         No, John, things are getting real
                         simple.
          
          42   INT. JOHN AND ANN MILLANEY'S HOUSE -- DAY
          
               Ann, dressed in some of John's work clothes (old cotton shirt,
               khaki pants) is cleaning the house. Not cleaning like a normal
               person, but like an obsessive/compulsive person. Scrubbing spots
               that are already clean, vacuuming the same area of rug over
               and over, etc. Suddenly, an object lodges itself in the snout
               of the vacuum cleaner, making a loud noise. Shutting the machine
               off, Ann turns it over and sees that Cynthia's diamond stud
               earring has gotten hooked in the take-up roller.
          
               Ann stares at Cynthia's earring for a long moment.
          
               CUT TO:
          
               Cynthia picking up her jacket from beside the bed after having
               sex with John. The earring slips out of the pocket and bounces
               under the edge of the bed.
          
               CUT BACK TO:
          
               Ann as she sets the earring onto the floor and begins to pound
               it with the bottom of a water glass, trying to smash it to
               pieces. She soon realizes the futility of trying to break a
               diamond.
          
               Ann looks down at herself. Suddenly realizing that she is
               dressed in John's clothing, she frantically rips the shirt and
               pants from her body as though the material were burning her
               skin. Popped buttons skid across the floor.
          
               Clothed only in her bra and underwear, Ann sits in the middle
               of the bedroom floor, arms around herself.
          
          43   EXT. JOHN AND ANN MILLANEY'S HOUSE -- DAY
          
               Ann, now in jeans and t-shirt, stumbles to her car. Once inside,
               she jams the key into the ignition and rests her head against
               the steering wheel.
          
          44   EXT. GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -- DAY
          
               Ann lifts her head from the steering wheel and looks up. She
               looks almost surprised to find that she has driven to Graham's.
               Slowly, she gets out of the car.
          
          45   INT. GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -- DAY
          
               Graham sits reading.
          
               There is a weak knock at the door. Graham listens, not sure he
               heard anything. There is a second weak knock.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         It's open!
          
               Nothing happens. Graham gets up and opens the door himself.
               Ann stands against the wall of the hallway, her head down, her
               breathing deliberate. Concerned, Graham slowly begins to lead
               her inside. Impulsively, she hugs him tightly.
          
               Unaccustomed to physical contact, Graham's hands hang awkwardly
               at his side. Ann slowly pulls back from the embrace and sits
               down. Graham goes to the kitchen area and gets her a glass of
               water. He gives it to her and sits in the chair opposite. Ann
               holds the glass in her hand, staring at it.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         It's bottled, not tap.
          
               A weak smile from Ann. She drinks, swallowing with difficulty.

                         I wouldn't have told you.

                         It's not my place to tell you these
                         things, Ann. You have to find out
                         by yourself or from John directly.
                         You have to trust me on this.
          
               Ann shakes her head.

                         My life is...shit. It's all shit.
                         It's like somebody saying, "Okay,

                         actually swimming pools" I mean,
                         nothing is what I thought it was.
                         What happened to me? Have I been
                         asleep? I vaguely remember the
                         wedding, but a lot of it is just
                         a blur...like I was watching
                         from a distance. I can't believe
                         him. Why didn't I trust my
                         intuition?

                         in his house. Nothing in that place
                         belongs to me. I wanted to put

               Graham stands in the middle of the room with a cigarette in
               his mouth, trying to teach himself to moonwalk.
          
          50   EXT. GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
          
               John screeches to a halt, parking haphazardly. He gets out of
               the car and runs to Graham's apartment.
          
          51   INT. GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
          
               John bursts through the door without bothering to knock. Graham
               looks up, startled. Before he can even react, John has him by
               the lapels.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Hi, John.

                         Where are the tapes, Graham?
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         What tapes?
          
                                   JOHN

                                   GRAHAM
                         John, as a lawyer, you should know
                         that those tapes are private
                         property.
          
                                   JOHN
                         So is my wife, asshole!!

                         She's not property, John, she's a
                         person. Were you just going to
                         keep right on lying to her?

                         love Ann. You think I'm going to

                         her feelings like that?
          
                                   GRAHAM

                         fucking nut. Now show me those
                         tapes.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         No.
          
                                   JOHN
                         I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd
                         better do what I say. Give me those
                         tapes.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         No.
          
               John punches Graham in the jaw, knocking him to the floor.
               Graham feels his mouth for blood as John picks him up by the
               shirt.
          
                                   JOHN
                         Graham, I swear to Christ I'll
                         kill your scrawny ass. Now give
                         me those tapes.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         No.
          
               John roughly pushes Graham into one of the director's chairs,
               which topples over and throws Graham to the floor once again.
          
               John looks around. He sees the boxes of tapes and begins to
               go through the contents. Graham gets up and runs over to stop
               him.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Get away from those!! They belong
                         to me!!
          
               Graham and John struggle. John hits Graham in the stomach and
               pushes him to the floor.
          
                                   JOHN
                         Give me your keys.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         My keys?
          
               John bends over and starts going through Graham's pockets.
          
                                   JOHN
                         Your keys, asshole!! Your two
                         fucking keys!! Give them to me!!
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         I'm not going to give you my keys.
          
               John beats Graham until Graham can offer no resistance. He then
               drags Graham into the hallway and leaves him there.
          
               John then locks himself inside Graham's apartment.
          
               John walks over to the boxes of videotapes and begins to search
               through them spastically. He finds both Cynthia and Ann's tapes.
               After a brief deliberation, he decides to watch Ann's. He turns
               on the player and the monitor. After pulling a chair up to the
               screen, John presses the button marked "play".
          
               In the hallway, Graham drags himself to the door of his
               apartment. Putting his ear to the inlet, he strains to hear
               what is going on inside.
          
               John watches the monitor come to life.
          
               The image is Ann, sitting in a chair.

               his brow.

               John stands and throws his chair against the door. Graham, still
               listening at the door, is startled.
          
                                   GRAHAM

                         to leave John?
          
               Ann thinks. John watches.

               John picks up the chair he threw and sets it upright. He sits
               down and watches the screen impassively. Graham still listens
               from outside.

                         long, I can't imagine living with

                         goes by. And anyway, I'm asking

                         But you. You have wasted nine
                         years. I mean, that has to be
                         some sort of weird record or
                         something, nine years. How does
                         that feel?
          
               Graham says nothing. Ann picks up the camera and points it at
               him.

                         I asked you a question, Graham.
                         I asked you "how does it feel"?

               Graham reaches up for the camera. Ann knocks his hand away.
          
                                   ANN

                         you feel.
          
               Graham is on the verge of completely falling apart.

                         allow for any gray areas, and

                         it. It's not something I can fix.
                         It's difficult. There s something

                         them, you're so vulnerable, you're

                         protection. And...somebody could

                         you re in this...state
                         of...nakedness. And they could
                         hurt you without even knowing it.
                         In a way that you couldn't even

                         sure it didn't happen again.
          
               Ann looks at him for a long moment and then sets the camera
               down.
          
               She moves in front of Graham and kneels.

               Ann reaches out, and Graham instinctively begins to move away.

               Something in her voice makes him stop. Their eyes lock. Graham
               slowly moves back toward her.
          
               Ann's hand eases out to him, her eyes still burning into his.
               Graham closes his eyes, accepting Ann's touch.
          
               She caresses him.
          
               Slowly.
          
               Delicately.
          
               She touches his arms, his face, his hair.
          
               Closing her eyes, she takes his hand and puts it against her
               face.
          
               She begins to lie him back on the couch. When he offers light
               resistance, she gently persists.
          
                                   ANN
                         Keep your eyes closed.
          
               Graham lies back, silently obeying.
          
               Ann touches his face.
          
               Gradually, her hand slips to his neck and she begins to 
               unbutton his shirt. She watches his face, hoping that he will
               remain calm. He does.
          
               She rubs her hand on his chest.
          
               Once again she brings Graham's hand to her face. She moves his
               hand to her neck and throat, painting her skin with his fingers.
          
               Soon each hand is exploring the other. Fingers search for and
               find hidden areas.
          
               Ann stands.
          
               Their hands remain together, and Graham's eyes remain closed.
               Ann moves onto the couch with Graham.
          
               She gently lowers herself into a sitting position on his waist.
          
               She slowly moves both of her hands onto Graham's chest. They
               move forward and back, like a lazy tide.
          
               She looks at Graham. His face is tranquil.
          
               Ann quietly begins to move her face toward his.
          
               Soon she is hovering inches above him, her long hair touching
               his features.
          
               She lowers her lips to his forehead and kisses him. She waits
               for a negative reaction. Getting none, she moves lower and 
               kisses his eyes. Still receiving no discouragement, she moves
               to his nose.
          
               A subtle movement from Graham. Ann waits for a moment.
          
               She then moves to his lips, her luxuriant tresses enveloping
               his face.
          
               She kisses him lightly.
          
               She kisses him again.
          
               Graham tilts his head back and she softly kisses his neck.
          
               Graham's hands make their way up Ann's back until they have
               reached her neck. He slowly pulls his face to hers.
          
               He kisses her.
          
               Graham is flooded with warmth and excitement.
          
               He caresses her, intoxicating himself with physical contact.
          
               The kisses become more meaningful, and the touching becomes
               more passionate.
          
               For a moment, Graham seems about to evaporate in a state of
               ecstasy, his eyes filled with relief and happiness.
          
               But his gaze happens to fall on the video camera, which
               continues to record.
          
               Graham seizes up and abruptly backs away from Ann's embrace.
               Reality slowly envelopes him.

               Ann reaches for his hand. He allows her to take it.

                         It's okay.
          
               Graham looks at Ann for a long moment. She sees the acceptance
               and gratitude in his eyes. She smiles lightly.
          
               Graham moves forward and shuts off the camera.

               from the player, and heads for the door.
          
               Graham, hearing the footsteps approach, backs away from the
               inlet. His eye is swollen, and he holds one of his hands in
               a curious position.
          
               John opens the door. He looks at Graham for a moment before
               reaching into his pocket for Graham's keys. He dangles them
               in his hand as he stands over Graham.

                         trouble, even. So you can stop
                         making her into a saint. She was
                         good in bed and she could keep
                         a secret. And that's about all
                         I can say about her.
          
               John drops Graham's keys to the floor and leaves. Graham stands,
               fighting back tears, and walks into his apartment.
          
               He pulls Ann's tape from the videotape player.
          
               He reaches inside the cassette cartridge and pulls the videotape
               itself out, ruining it forever. He does the same to every other
               tape in both the boxes. Calmly. Deliberately. Methodically.
          
               He walks over to the camera/recorder, trailing a mound of
               videotape behind him. He breaks the lens off the camera body,
               and smashes the inner workings against the edge of the table.
               He then drops the damaged unit into the pile of destroyed tape,
               where it disappears.

                         help the way you feel, you just
                         have to be honest about it.
          
               John dials a number on his telephone.

                         One moment.

                              (to his colleague)
                         Anyway, I've always said, the work
                         is the thing. I can be happy
                         without a marriage, but take away
                         my work, that's different. And
                         if Ann can't handle that, that's
                         her problem, like we re all alone
                         in this world, you know what I'm
                         saying? I mean, fuck.
                              (looks at phone)
                         Jesus, what's takin' this guy?
          
               The intercom clicks to life.

                                   JOHN

                         Okay, in a minute, I'm on with
                         a client.

                         He said immediately.
          
                                   JOHN
                         All right, jesus.

                         you that he has obtained legal
                         representation elsewhere, and that
                         if you have a message for him to
                         leave it with me.
          
               John swallows.
          
                                   JOHN
                         Thank you. I...there is no message.
                         Thank you.
          
               John hangs up. He thinks for a moment, rubbing his forehead.
          
               The intercom clicks to life.

                         waiting.
          
                                   DUDE
                              (voice over)
                         Come on, I'm not asking too much,
                         am I? Just one little question.
          
          53   INT. LOUNGE -- DAY
          
               Cynthia is tending bar. The Dude from earlier is still there,
               puffing On a big cigar.
          
                                   DUDE
                         Just tell me what time you get
                         off. Work, I mean. What's the
                         harm in that? Whaddaya say?
          
               Ann enters the lounge. Cynthia watches with apprehensive
               surprise as Ann approaches with a potted plant.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                              (to Dude)
                         Excuse me.
          
               Cynthia moves to meet Ann at the end of the bar. Ann sets the
               plant down on the counter. Her manner is diffident, but not
               hostile.
          
                                   ANN
                         I know it's your birthday, and
                         I know you like plants. So I got
                         you this.
          
               Cynthia is very moved, though she struggles valiantly to conceal
               her emotions.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Thank you.
          
                                   ANN
                         Well. I can't stay.
          
               Ann begins to leave.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Can I call you?
          
               Ann turns back to face her. They look at each other for a
               moment.
          
                                   ANN
                         Do you have my work number?
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         No.
          
               Ann writes the number down on a napkin.
          
                                   ANN
                         I get real busy between two and
                         four.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Okay.
          
                         Ann looks at Cynthia again before leaving.
          
                                   ANN
                         Bye.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Bye.
          
               Ann leaves. Cynthia continues to look at the door long after
               Ann has left.
          
                                   DUDE
                         Nice plant.
          
          Cynthia turns to him.
          
                                   CYNTHIA
                         Do me a favor. Don't come in here
                         anymore.
          
          54   SCENE DELETED
          
          55   INT. GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -- DAY
          
               Graham sits reading. There is now some furniture in the
               apartment. Bookshelves, plants, etc. There are periodicals on
               the table where the video gear used to be. There are no
               cigarettes.
          
               There is a knock at Graham's door, which now has a deadbolt
               lock.
          
                                   GRAHAM
                         Who is it?
          
               A knock again. Graham sets his book down and goes to the door.
               He unlocks the deadbolt and opens it.
          
               Ann stands in the hallway.
          
               Graham is obviously flushed with feeling at seeing her. She
               wordlessly moves into the room, her movements like a slow
               breeze, her expression calm.
          
               Graham watches her go by.
          
               She stops in the middle of the room, her back to him.
          
               Graham moves toward her slowly. Sensing him behind her, her
               breathing becomes deep.
          
               Graham slowly enfolds her in his arms, his face against her
               hair.
          
               She closes her eyes as their fingers entwine.
          
               CUT TO BLACK
          
               THE END
