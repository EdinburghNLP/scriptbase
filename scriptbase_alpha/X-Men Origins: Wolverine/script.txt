          EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY

          A two-lane road carves through an endless forest of towering
          black spruce. A flock of pintails skims over the treetops,
          heading south before the first snowfall.
          A young BOY (12), undersized and feral, trudges home, bookbag
          strapped to his back. Black-haired and pale-skinned, the boy
          looks as if he hasn't had a good meal in a long time.
          Before we hear anything the boy turns, watching the bend in
          the road behind him. After a moment we hear the thrum of a
          hard-charging engine.
          An Oldsmobile Super 88 rounds the bend, accelerating as it
          hits the straightaway. The boy steps away from the road but
          the car comes straight at him.
          The boy closes his eyes. The Oldsmobile's brakes clamp down
          on the wheels and the car shivers to a halt with inches to
          spare. Laughter spills from the car's open windows.
          Four HIGH SCHOOL LETTERMEN pile out of the car, wearing their
          leather-sleeved football jackets. GILMAN, the largest of the
          four, shakes his head and laughs.

          GILMAN
          Kid didn't even move. You see that?
          Where's your survival instincts,
          boy?
          The boy says nothing. He readjusts his bookbag and resumes
          his long walk northward.
          GILMAN (cont'd)
          Hey!
          Gilman grabs the boy's shoulder and spins him around-
          GILMAN (cont'd)
          The hell you going? You hear me
          talking to you?
          One of the other football players, MASON, walks over and
          inspects the boy's face.

          MASON
          This is the kid whose old man
          robbed the truck stop last year.
          Gilman curls his meaty hand around the back of the boy's neck
          and pulls him closer, scrutinizing him. The four lettermen
          tower over the small boy.

          GILMAN
          You the one with the convict daddy?
          The boy stares back at Gilman, unblinking.

          MASON
          That's him.

          GILMAN
          What's the matter, you about to
          piss your pants? Answer me.
          The boy says nothing, never looking away from the bully.
          Gilman presses his fist, adorned with a heavy class ring,
          against the.boy's cheek.
          GILMAN (cont'd)
          You a tough guy like your daddy?
          Gilman shoves the boy, forcing him to stumble backwards. The
          boy regains his balance, never taking his eyes off Gilman.
          GILMAN (cont'd)
          You want to play tough guy with me?
          Huh?
          Provoked by the boy's lack of fear, by the insolence of his
          stare, Gilman rears back and punches him in the face.
          The boy falls to the ground. Blood spills from a gash in his
          cheek where the class ring cut him.

          MASON
          (a ringside announcer)
          Right cross to the face... and he's
          down!
          The football players laugh, looking down at the fallen boy.
          The boy stands. There is still no sign of emotion on his
          face. No fear, no anger, no evident pain.

          GILMAN
          What's the matter? You want some
          more?
          The boy doesn't look away. The bully swings, cracking the boy
          in the side of the head, knocking him down again.
          GILMAN (cont'd)
          (to his friends)
          Let's get out of here.

          Walking back to the car, Mason slaps Gilman on the shoulder.

          MASON
          You gave that little pissant
          something to think about.
          Gilman grins and looks back at the boy, expecting him to be
          sprawled and crying on the ground.
          Instead the boy stands again, brushes the dirt off his shirt,
          and walks toward Gilman.

          GILMAN
          You got to be kidding me. I'm gonna
          knock the--
          But Gilman's words die in his throat as he sees something
          impossible happening. The gash on the boy's cheek knits
          itself shut, leaving no sign of injury.
          Gilman is so shocked he doesn't see the boy's fist whizzing
          toward him, striking him in the nose. And then another punch.
          And then another.
          The boy is far smaller and weaker than Gilman, but he fights
          with a ferocity that seems inhuman, punching and kicking and
          headbutting, doing whatever it takes to fell his enemy.
          Gilman, stunned by the intensity of the assault, goes down,
          trying to protect his face from the blur of blows.
          Mason tries to pull the boy off his friend and suffers a bite
          to the hand. He howls with pain and backs off.
          The other two football players, amazed to see their leader
          getting pummeled by a boy half his size, watch in awe.
          The boy growls as he batters the bully. He grabs Gilman's
          collar and lifts the football player's head off the ground,
          prepared to deliver the coup de grace with his right fist.
          Three bone claws spring from the boy's hand, serrated and
          razor sharp.
          Everything stops. Mason, clutching his wounded hand, quits
          hollering and stares. The other two football players blink
          and slowly back away.
          Even Gilman, moaning on the ground, hushes and tries to crawl
          backwards, away from this beast on top of him.

          CONTINUED: (3)
          But the boy is more shocked than-any of them. He stares with
          horror at the claws, this part of him he never knew existed.
          He stands and stumbles away from Gilman. Mason runs over,
          lifts his punch-drunk friend to his feet, and hustles him
          toward the Oldsmobile.
          The other football players pile in, slam the doors shut, and
          speed off, leaving the boy alone by the side of the road.
          The boy stares at his claws and for the first time we see
          fear in his eyes. He screams, a scream that echoes over the
          black spruce, into the darkening northern sky.

          INT. CABIN - MORNING

          LOGAN wakes. with a wordless shout, sitting upright,
          shirtless, in a bed covered with shredded bedsheets.
          KAYLA SILVERFOX (25) wraps her arms around him and whispers
          in his ear.

          KAYLA
          It's okay... shh... it's okay.
          Logan pants, chest heaving, eyes wild, gripping the tattered
          sheets in his fists. Kayla holds him tight until his bone
          claws retract.
          KAYLA (cont'd)
          I'm right here with you. Okay? I'm
          right here with you.
          Kayla, a full-blooded Innu, wears her long black hair pulled
          back in a ponytail. She's been sleeping in one of Logan's
          flannel shirts.
          KAYLA (cont'd)
          The war dreams or the one where
          you're a kid?
          Logan takes a deep breath, finally calming down. He relaxes
          into Kayla's arms.

          LOGAN
          The one where I'm a kid.
          Kayla runs her fingers through his thick hair, kissing his
          forehead. He sees that she has a small cut on her forearm. He
          takes her arm and looks at the wound.

          She kisses him.

          We need new sheets again, baby.

          EXT. CARNIVAL - NIGHT

          A traveling carnival has come to a seaside New England town.
          The brightly-lit Ferris Wheel spins a few hundred yards
          inland from the dark Atlantic.
          LOCALS roam through the carnival, lining up to ride the Tilt-
          A-Whirl. KIDS carrying plumes of cotton candy race from shoot-
          'em-up games to free throw competitions.
          A CARNY BARKER of the old school, wearing a patched-suit and
          a derby, beckons the curious to his attraction.

          CARNY BARKER
          Come see the notorious Bird Man!
          Half-man, half-eagle, is he an
          angel from Heaven or a spawn of
          Satan? Ladies and gentlemen,
          tonight is your last chance to see
          the creature you've all been
          hearing about:
          We follow two BOYS who hand the barker their tickets, pull
          aside the curtain and step into the sideshow...

          INT. SIDESHOW - CONTINUOUS

          .joining a small crowd of CURIOUS ONLOOKERS. The tent is
          dark save for a spotlight fixed on a tiny stage.
          SHERRLENE, a peroxide-blonde in her fifties, whose tanned
          hide is covered with interlaced tattoos, slaps a tribal beat
          on a pair of bongos.
          The crowd hushes. A tall man in a hooded robe shuffles toward,
          the stage like a boxer long past his prime. He stands in
          front of the gawkers, head bowed, face shadowed by his hood.

          CONTINUED:
          Finally BEAK throws off his robe and raises his wings to the
          crowd. As advertised, he looks like an amalgam of man and
          bird, with three-toed, clawed feet and dirty-feathered wings.
          His very human, tired brown eyes are set in a face dominated
          by a long sharp beak. He stares back at the gaping crowd.
          Beak looks more pathetic than monstrous. His skinny limbs
          don't seem very strong and he projects an air of weary
          resignation, not menace.
          But when he flaps his gray wings and caws at the onlookers,
          the children shriek in terror and bury their faces in their
          father's legs.

          INT. BEAK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

          Sherrlene and Beak sit at a card table, playing gin and
          drinking bourbon.

          SHERRLENE
          I'm gonna knock with three.

          BEAK
          Are you kidding me?
          He throws down his hand in disgust.

          SHERRLENE
          You always hold out for gin. You
          could have knocked a while ago.

          BEAK
          Yeah, well, I'm an eternal.
          optimist.
          Sherrlene tallies the points.

          SHERRLENE
          All right, I'm gonna hit it. You
          want to come look for shells with
          me on the beach tomorrow?

          BEAK
          I don't want to scare away any
          tourists.

          SHERRLENE
          Aw, sweetie, it's winter. No
          tourists. I'll come get you in the
          morning.

          Sherrlene collects her things, stands, and kisses Beak on the
          side of his feathered head.

          BEAK
          Goodnight, Sherrlene.

          SHERRLENE
          Night, Beak. Sweet dreams.
          Sherrlene closes the door behind her and Beak flips through
          the deck of cards, preparing for another lonely night.
          A knock on the door.

          BEAK
          You forget your purse?
          (another knock)
          All right, all right, I'm coming.
          He stands and opens the door.

          EXT. BEAK'S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

          A towering figure in a long black coat looms beside the
          trailer's door.

          BEAK
          Show's over, pal.
          VICTOR CREED is shrouded in shadows, but when he grins his
          white fangs gleam. He drapes his arm around Beak and drags
          the birdman inside the trailer.

          VICTOR CREED
          Show's never over for you, freak..

          INT. BEAK'S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS


          BEAK

          bucks on the dresser. That's all I

          HAVE--

          VICTOR CREED
          I just want to hear you talk a
          minute before I cut your lungs out.
          Creed shoves Beak back into his seat, picks up the bottle of
          bourbon, examines the label, and guzzles it. Beak opens his
          mouth but no words come out. Finally:

          mutants.
          Creed wipes his lips with the back of his clawed hand.
          BEAK (cont'd)
          But you... you're one of us.

          VICTOR CREED
          Us? There's no us. There's you and
          there's me, and in a minute, just
          me.
          Creed smiles down at his feathered target. Beak tries to
          shield his body with his wings.

          BEAK
          Please... I never hurt anybody, my
          whole life...

          VICTOR CREED
          Let me show you how it's done.

          EXT. BEAK'S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

          An awful, prolonged shriek escapes from the trailer.

          EXT. CABIN - DAY

          The small log cabin sits in a clearing in a jack pine forest.
          Winter has come to the north country; the ground and tree
          branches are covered with several inches of snow.
          Logan chops firewood behind the cabin, splitting the logs
          with expert axe strikes, smoking a cheap cigar.
          His nose wrinkles as he sniffs the air.

          LOGAN.
          Smells like government.
          Behind Logan, two approaching men in dark suits and black
          overcoats glance at each other. Logan, halving another block
          of wood, doesn't turn around.
          One of the newcomers, STRYKER, was a colonel in the Special
          Forces. He still has the look. His hair is cropped short, his
          bearing is military, and his blue eyes are fierce.

          Logan turns, the axe gripped in his hand.
          STRYKER (cont'd)
          Been a long time, Logan. You
          haven't aged a day. Everyone else
          gets old and gray, but not you.

          LOGAN
          How'd you find me?

          STRYKER
          We never lost you, my friend. I
          believe you know my colleague?
          Logan and Agent Zero stare at each other. There is a history
          between these two and clearly the memories are not fond.
          STRYKER (cont'd)

          automatic from his shoulder holster, fires, and reholsters.

          AGENT ZERO

          clenches his fists.

          a load of firewood and . stacks. it beside the cabin.
          STRYKER (cont'd)
          You're a born warrior. You can hide

          this is going badly, tries to break the tension.

          STRYKER
          We're putting together a team. Best
          men in the business. Men with...
          special qualities. Men like you.

          LOGAN
          Forget it.
          Logan walks around to the front of the cabin. Stryker and
          Agent Zero follow. Logan's battered old pickup truck is
          parked beside the newcomers' Lincoln.

          STRYKER
          It's a team of hunters. We're going
          after some very bad people.
          Logan climbs into the driver's seat.
          STRYKER (cont'd)
          You read the papers, Logan? They're
          killing mutants.
          Logan closes the door, turns the key and revs the engine to
          warm it. Stryker taps on the window. Logan grits his teeth
          and rolls down the window, not looking at the colonel.
          STRYKER (cont'd)
          Listen to me. They have names. They
          have addresses.

          LOGAN
          I can take care of myself.

          STRYKER
          All right, forget about yourself.
          Your country needs you.

          LOGAN
          I'm Canadian.
          He hits the gas, forcing Stryker to jump back lest the tires
          run over his foot. Stryker and Agent Zero watch him go.

          EXT. DISTRICT UNIFIED SCHOOL - DAY

          Logan parks in the lot of a sprawling brick grammar school.
          He gets out of the truck and walks toward the main building.
          The school day has ended. STUDENTS meet up with their MOMS or
          DADS for the ride home.
          As Logan rounds a corner, he stops in his tracks, looking
          around. Something's not quite right.
          Logan'ducks his head at the last. possible second and a
          snowball whizzes past, missing him by inches.
          Six FOURTH GRADERS (four boys and two girls) charge at him,
          hurling snowballs and screaming.

          FOURTH GRADERS
          Get him!
          Logan jumps back around the corner, out of sight. The fourth
          graders chase after him, round the corner with their throwing
          hands cocked, ready to launch some serious ice.
          Logan is nowhere in sight.
          The fourth graders turn in confused circles, searching for
          their target, snowballs melting in their hands.

          LOGAN (O.S.)
          Hey, fellas.
          The boys and girls look up and see Logan sitting on a second-
          floor window ledge. He has already formed six perfect
          snowballs, with which he proceeds to pelt the fourth graders.
          The kids run, screaming and laughing, nearly colliding with
          Kayla, who rounds the corner and stares up at Logan.

          KAYLA
          Nice.
          Logan, caught with a snowball in his hand, looks sheepish.

          LOGAN
          They started it.

          INT. PICKUP TRUCK - LATER

          Logan drives Kayla home over roads slick with black ice. She
          sings softly along with the country song on the radio.

          LOGAN
          Stryker came by the house today.

          KAYLA
          Stryker? Colonel Stryker? The one
          you told me about?
          (off Logan's nod)
          What did he want?

          LOGAN
          Wants me back.

          KAYLA
          And?

          LOGAN
          Told him no.

          KAYLA
          So why can't they get someone else?
          Logan thinks about it for a moment. When he speaks there is a
          degree of self-loathing in his tone.

          LOGAN
          I'm the best there is at what I do.
          And what I do best isn't very nice.
          Kayla studies the side of his face for a moment.
          LOGAN (cont'd)
          Maybe he's right. Maybe it's the
          only thing I'm good for.
          Kayla watches him. Logan shakes his head as if ridding
          himself of an errant thought.
          LOGAN (cont'd)
          Son of a bitch had me thinking
          about it for a minute.
          He wraps his arm around her shoulders and pulls her closer.

          KAYLA
          Hey. You're not a freak.

          LOGAN
          Most guys don't have to worry about
          gutting their girlfriend when they
          have a bad dream.

          KAYLA

          LOGAN
          A gift?
          Logan shakes his head, staring at the black ribbon of road.

          You can return a gift..

          INT. CABIN - NIGHT

          A well-built fire burns in the fireplace. Logan and Kayla sit
          naked in front of it, wrapped in an old flannel quilt.

          KAYLA
          The kids made cornhusk dolls today
          in Arts and Crafts.
          She reaches for her bag and pulls out a little doll.
          KAYLA (cont'd)
          I made one for you.
          Kayla hands him the doll and he examines it by firelight.
          Given the limitations of the art form, it's a skillful
          representation of Logan, unique hairstyle and all.

          LOGAN
          I look like Elvis.

          KAYLA
          You're Elvis with claws.
          The moon, swollen and red-hued, rises above the dark hills,
          framed in the cabin's window.

          You know why the moon's so lonely?
          Logan shakes his head. Kayla lies back, resting her head on
          Logan's leg as he plays with her hair.
          KAYLA (cont'd)
          She used to have a lover.
          Kuekuatsheu. They lived in the
          Spirit World and every night they'd
          wander the skies together. But one
          of the other spirits was jealous.
          Trickster wanted the Moon for
          himself. So he told Kuekuatsheu the
          Moon asked for flowers. He told him
          to come to our world and pick her
          some wild roses.

          LOGAN
          Never trust a guy named Trickster.

          KAYLA
          Yeah, well, you do some stupid
          things when you're in love.
          Kuekuatsheu didn't know that once
          you leave the Spirit World, you can
          never go back. Now he's trapped
          here. Every night the Moon searches
          for him and every night he sees her
          in the sky and howls her name...
          but he can never touch her again.
          For a moment they're both quiet, contemplating the sad myth.

          EXT. CABIN - NIGHT

          Viewed from a distance, the little cabin looks warm and
          inviting, the firelight shining from the windows.
          Something watches from the edge. of the dark woods. Something
          monstrous, its black talons carving gashes in the trunk of a
          pine tree.

          EXT. LOGGING CAMP - MORNING

          Kayla drops Logan off at the logging camp. The site is
          already loud with motorized activity. TRIMMERS remove the
          limbs from fallen trees. TEAMSTERS in forklifts load logs
          onto flatbed trucks.
          Logan comes around to the driver's side window, holding his
          orange Husqvarna chainsaw in one hand.

          KAYLA
          Be careful.
          Logan bends forward to kiss her on the lips. He turns and
          walks towards a crew of LUMBERJACKS circled around a
          SUPERVISOR with a clipboard.
          Logan turns when he hears a honk. Kayla leans out the window.
          KAYLA (cont'd)
          I love you, by the way.
          Logan notices that dozens of lumberjacks are watching this
          scene. He clears his throat.

          LOGAN
          T love you, too.

          SUPERVISOR
          (thick Maine accent)
          We all love you, Casanova, but
          could we get to work here? We need
          to let some daylight in the swamp.
          The lumberjacks laugh loudly. Damage done, Kayla waves a
          cheerful goodbye and drives away from the camp.
          Logan trudges into the circle of lumberjacks, who make kissie-
          kissie sounds and slap his shoulder.
          SUPERVISOR (cont'd)

          choppers for 3B, that's gonna be

          EXT. ACCESS ROAD - MORNING

          An eighteen-wheel flatbed loaded with trimmed logs blocks the
          road. Men in reflective vests stand on the flatbed, securing
          the load with chains.
          Kayla hits the brakes and checks-her watch. She's late. She
          taps the horn.
          A FOREMAN ambles over to her, in no particular rush.

          FOREMAN
          Can't move the truck till the
          load's tied down.

          KAYLA
          Please? I'm already late.

          FOREMAN

          The foreman thinks about it, sighs, and changes his tune.

          scoot through in her pickup. She toots her horn and waves.

          KAYLA
          Thanks, fellas.

          EXT. TIMBER STAND - MORNING

          Logan and three other lumberjacks-- PHELAN, MARCUSE, and VAN
          MIER-- tramp through the woods towards their designated area,
          carrying their chainsaws and helmets.
          Phelan, whiskey-bellied and flushed from the exertion, has
          fallen behind.

          PHELAN
          You all want to ease the pace a
          little bit? Trees ain't going
          anywhere.
          Logan, in the lead, stares at a crude smiley face carved into
          a tall pine tree. His gaze travels from the carving to
          something sitting on the forest floor.

          PHELAN (cont'd)

          Lolly's get the adverbs here...
          Rounding a corner on the narrow access road, Kayla nearly
          collides with a man in a long black coat. She slams on the
          brakes and the truck shudders to a halt.
          The man's back is turned to the truck, his head bowed. His
          hair hangs below his shoulders, clotted with dirt, as if he's
          been sleeping in the woods for weeks.
          Kayla leans out of the open truck window. Before she can
          speak, the man in the long black coat turns.
          It's not just his size that frightens us, though the man is
          massive. It's not just the four-inch-long black talons
          curling from his fingertips, or the gleaming fangs he licks
          as he smiles at her.
          What terrifies us most are his eyes. They are a shark's eyes,
          black and loveless and utterly inhuman.

          hood, carved straight through the steel.

          EXT. TIMBER STAND - CONTINUOUS

          Logan, hearing a noise the other men can't, rises from his
          crouch. He looks to the west, listening carefully.

          PHELAN
          What's the matter--
          Logan holds up a hand: quiet. He hears a distant scream. A.
          voice he knows better than any other.
          He runs, leaving his astonished co-workers behind.
          No one can run through the woods faster than Logan and'Logan
          has never needed to run faster. He vaults fallen trees, ducks
          under branches, accelerates when he hits the access road.

          EXT. ACCESS ROAD - MINUTES LATER

          Logan sees the pickup truck in the distance. Even a hundred
          yards away he can tell that something is.wrong.
          It seems impossible that he could run any faster, but now he
          does, reaching the truck in seconds. He sees the claw marks
          gouged through the steel hood.
          He sees.the driver's side door tossed onto the asphalt twenty
          yards. from the truck.
          And finally he sees Kayla, curled in the fetal position on
          the side of the access road. Blood puddles beneath her. Her
          skin has already begun to lose its 'color.
          He runs to her, kneels beside her body, hands checking for a
          pulse, listening for breath, trying desperately to find any
          sign of life in her lifeless form.

          He rocks back and forth, her lifeless body clutched tightly
          in his arms, his eyes clenched shut.
          The veins bulge in his neck, every muscle in his body tenses,
          as if there were a beast inside him trying to break free of
          his skin.

          INT. CASADY'S BAR & GRILL - DAY

          The local dive opens early. TOWN DRUNKS sit by themselves,
          smoking cigarettes, sipping the day's first hair-of--the-dog,
          reading the paper or staring into their beer.
          Victor Creed sits at the bar, carving a crude smiley face
          into the wood with the claw of his index finger. He looks up
          and sees the BARTENDER staring at him. The bartender doesn't
          approve of the vandalism, but he's not about to say anything.
          Creed taps the rim of his glass. The bartender comes over
          with a bottle of George Dickel Tennessee whiskey. He fills
          Creed's glass halfway-- a standard pour.
          Creed stares at the bartender. He taps the glass again. The
          bartender, hand shaking, fills the glass to the brim.
          Creed raises the whiskey to the light.

          VICTOR CREED
          Stuff don't work on me. I drink and
          drink and I never feel any
          different.
          He downs the full glass of whiskey with a swallow. He looks
          around the bar, at the pool table in the back, the Wurlitzer
          jukebox, the stacked bottles of liquor.
          VICTOR CREED (cont'd)
          You got any insurance on this
          place?

          BARTENDER
          Insurance? I guess so. Why?
          Creed wipes his mouth with the back of his hand.

          VICTOR CREED
          'Cause it's about to get ugly.
          Logan walks into the tavern, sniffing the air. He sees Creed
          sitting on the barstool, back to the door.

          Logan approaches the bar, never taking his eyes off creed.
          Finally Creed turns to look at Logan. He stands, towering
          above the smaller man.
          Logan sees a splotch of dried blood on the back of Creed's
          hand. Creed knows Logan is looking at it. He lifts his hand
          to his mouth and licks the blood off.
          VICTOR CREED (cont'd)
          Sweet girl. Tasted like strawberry
          jam.
          The bone claws burst from Logan's hands, pale, white, and
          serrated. He growls and swings at Creed's head.
          The big man is fast. He ducks under the claws, grinning and
          circling like a boxer, happy that he's finally got a decent
          adversary.
          The bartender and the local drunks have seen plenty of bar
          fights, but not ones featuring clawed mutants. They run.
          VICTOR CREED (cont'd)
          You can scare off the civilians
          with those, sonny boy. But I got
          claws of my own.
          He swings, raking his talons across Logan's chest, drawing
          first blood. Logan lunges at Creed and the battle begins.
          -The pace of the combat is startling, the physical power
          stupendous. A missed swipe by Creed ends with him clawing out

          swatted into the wall, smashing the plasterboard.
          Creed grabs Logan by the collar and tosses him onto the pool
          table. Creed brings his fist down, looking to pulverize
          Logan's skull, but the smaller man rolls clear. Creed's fist
          shatters the slate and the table collapses.
          Clearing his head on the sawdusted floor, Logan sees the
          eight ball rolling past. He picks it up and hurls it at
          Creed's head.
          Creed catches the eight ball in his left hand and squeezes
          his fist shut. He opens his hand and lets the powdered
          remains spill onto the floor.
          Logan springs to his feet and swings at creed, again and
          again, his claws whooshing through the air.

          Creed, despite his bulk, is an elegant fighter. He circles
          just out of reach, grinning as the claws slash past his face.
          Creed grabs Logan's right wrist as it flies by. He grabs the
          left wrist. His wet fangs glisten as they plunge toward
          Logan's throat.

          smashing Creed's face with a glorious headbutt.

          As Creed staggers back, Logan kicks him in the chest,
          knocking the big man over the bar, where he crashes into the
          bottles of liquor and slides to the floor in a tumult of
          glass shards and alcohol.
          Logan sees a lit cigarette in an ashtray on one of the
          tables. He picks the butt up and flicks it over the bar.
          The cigarette ignites the spilt alcohol. Creed roars and
          rises to his feet, a burning man.
          He vaults over the bar and advances on Logan. The flames
          consume his overcoat, licking at his skin. Creed slaps them
          out with his palms, apparently oblivious to the pain.

          You put up a better fight than your

          Creed snatches Logan and slings him headfirst through the
          plate glass window.

          Logan hits the snow-covered pavement hard, splinters -of glass
          in his hair, his face bloodied from dozens of small cuts.
          Creed steps out the bar. As Logan struggles to his feet Creed
          kicks out his legs and drops him again.
          Creed crouches beside Logan, grabs the back of his head, and
          smashes his face into the concrete.
          The beating gets savage, creed hammering Logan again and
          again. Logan's healing factor cannot keep up with the
          violence being done to his body.

          VICTOR CREED

          You were a tough little guy. But
          there's always someone tougher.
          Creed plunges his clawed hand into Logan's chest. Logan
          gasps, eyes widening. His tolerance for pain is world-class
          but this is another level of suffering.
          VICTOR CREED (cont'd)
          And it's always me.
          Creed stands, staring down at Logan's unmoving body. Sirens
          moan in the distance. Creed walks away.
          Logan bleeds in the snow. We rise above him, higher and
          higher, his battered body dwindling as we rise with the
          smoke.

          Two MALE NURSES shove a gurney down the corridor. Logan is

          surgical scissors.

          LOGAN (cont'd)
          How did you know?

          STRYKER
          He got the List.

          LOGAN
          What list?
          Stryker chokes, gasping for air. Logan eases up on his grip
          but doesn't release the man. Stryker takes a deep breath.

          STRYKER
          The List. Every known mutant in
          North America. Government's been
          keeping it for years. Names,
          addresses, everything.

          LOGAN
          How did he get it?

          STRYKER
          Someone must have leaked it to him.
          There are people in Washington who
          want to see you all destroyed.
          Logan releases Stryker. The ex-colonel straightens his jacket
          collar and composes himself.

          LOGAN
          Creed's a mutant, too.

          STRYKER
          Apparently he doesn't have much
          tribal loyalty.
          Logan turns and walks away. He looks like a homeless man, his
          clothes torn and bloodied, his hair disheveled. He walks
          fast. Stryker calls after him.

          Logan's fists are clenched. He's ready to hammer Stryker into
          the ground, but the older man does not back down.
          STRYKER (cont'd)
          You can't beat him. Not the way you
          are right now. You've probably gone
          your whole life without losing a

          can't beat him.

          You come with me, I promise you two
          things. You will suffer more pain

          Logan stares at the lonely moon. A wolf howls in the
          distance.
          His breath rises above him in the cold air; his wet hair
          freezes. Ignoring the gusting wind and bitter chill, he runs
          through the snow toward the distant woods.

          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

          Logan runs. Pine trees tower above him. He enters a clearing
          where the virgin snow glitters beneath the moon.
          He stops moving and peers through the darkness. He smells
          something coming closer.
          A pack of GRAY WOLVES emerges from the woods, surrounding
          Logan. Snow dusts their fur. They look hungry, their blue
          eyes unblinking as they watch this pale interloper.
          The LEADER OF THE PACK, a muscular brute far bigger than his
          comrades, snarls at Logan. Logan stares back at the wolf.
          The wolf jumps at Logan, fangs bared, aiming for the man's
          throat. Logan sidesteps and the wolf hurtles past, skidding
          on the snow when he lands.
          Logan and the wolf circle each other, looking for weakness.
          The wolf gnashes its wet teeth and pounces again.
          Man and beast battle in the moonlight, a shadowy combat of
          ferocious velocity, of gleaming fangs and gray fur.
          The wolf lunges for Logan's throat again, but this time Logan
          catches the wolf in one hand and slams it to the snow.
          The wolf, desperate to escape, rakes Logan's arm with his
          claws. Logan ignores the bloody welts.

          goes slack in Logan's grip, rolling over to signal surrender.
          Logan stands over the newly-subservient alpha wolf. The other
          wolves in the pack stare at the strange champion.
          Intense light shines on Logan's face. He turns and sees that
          he's surrounded by a dozen SOLDIERS wearing tactical armor.
          Powerful flashlights are mounted to the barrels of their
          guns, which are pointed at Logan.

          An APACHE LONGBOW helicopter streaks overhead, fifty feet
          above the ground.

          INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

          Logan checks James Hudson's pulse but finds none. He looks up
          when he hears the thrum of the military helicopter.
          Two Good Samaritans lie dead at his feet, slaughtered for
          sheltering him. Something bestial has. entered Logan's eyes.

          The Apache circles the farmhouse.

          INT. APACHE LONGBOW - CONTINUOUS

          Both the PILOT and the GUNNER wear helmets with monocular
          eyepieces that provide images from the external cameras.

          GUNNER'S EYEPIECE POV
          The farmhouse is centered in the crosshairs. Scrolling
          numbers to the side of the image indicate the range in
          meters. The gunner's finger tightens on the trigger.

          The Apache fires multiple Hellfire rockets, which blast out
          of their launchers and rip into the farmhouse.
          The old Hudson homestead collapses as the explosions blow out
          the roof and the support walls.

          The Apache hovers near the sheep barn, rotor blades fanning
          the rising smoke.

          INT. APACHE LONGBOW - CONTINUOUS

          As the gunner continues to scout the ground for any sign of a
          corpse, the pilot notices something out of the corner of his
          eye. He stares at the roof of the sheep barn.
          A smoke-darkened figure stares back at him.

          EXT. SHEEP BARN - CONTINUOUS

          Logan, claws extended, skin blackened with soot, jumps from
          the roof of the barn. He lands on the helicopter windshield.

          The pilot nearly jumps out of his seat.

          bulletproof glass.

          Agent Zero watches the Apache plummet to the ground. He
          snorts with amusement and activates his headset.

          Logan emerges from the Apache's wreckage and runs toward the
          sheep barn door.
          A bullet cracks him in the forehead and Logan falls backwards
          into the snow, stunned. For a few seconds we can glimpse the
          adamantium of his skull.
          His healing factor takes over and his skin begins to knit
          itself back together.
          Logan combat crawls inside the sheep barn.

          this bike with love and elbow grease. The chrome and leather
          shine as brightly as any new model on the factory floor.
          The key is in the ignition. This used to be a safe
          neighborhood.

          EXT. SHEEP BARN - CONTINUOUS

          Logan bursts out of the barn on the Harley. The tires spin on
          the snow but Logan is an experienced rider. He steadies the
          bike, steers it onto the blacktop and accelerates, heading in
          the opposite direction from Agent Zero.

          EXT. HUDSON FARM - CONTINUOUS

          Agent Zero grabs his rifle and jogs over to a black SUV with
          tinted windows and off-road tires.

          Logan speeds down the road, Agent Zero in hot pursuit. Zero
          gains ground, both hunter and quarry racing past 100 MPH.

          INT. SUV - DAY

          Agent Zero grabs an Atchisson assault shotgun from a rack
          behind his seat that holds an impressive array of weaponry.
          He lowers the passenger window and gets a bead on Logan, who
          swerves to keep himself (and his more fragile motorcycle) a
          tricky target.

          EXT. COUNTY ROAD - DAY

          Agent Zero fires six shells in rapid succession. Hundreds of
          steel pellets scream over the motorcycle, perforating the
          face of a smiling farmer on a fertilizer billboard.
          Logan turns and sees the SUV closing on him. Agent Zero rams
          the bumper into the Harley and Logan very nearly loses
          control, managing to right the bike at the last second.

          Logan accelerates and opens up thirty yards of breathing
          room. He turns and sees Agent Zero catching up again.
          Logan clamps on the brakes, hard.
          He holds out his left hand and extends his claws. The tips of
          the blades scrape the asphalt and sparks fly.
          The SUV cannot brake in time. As it hurtles past the
          motorcycle, Logan's claws hit the SUV's front tire and shred
          it instantly. A split-second later he shreds the rear tire.
          The SUV totters, falls to its side, and barrel rolls across
          the empty road. It ends up on its roof in a drainage ditch,
          wheels still spinning in the air.
          Logan turns his bike and pulls up next to the upended SUV. He
          lowers the kickstand, stands, and walks to the driver's side.
          Agent Zero, bloodied and dazed, has managed to push open the
          door. He leans out and aims his shotgun at Logan, who slices
          the weapon into four pieces with a sweep of his claws.
          Logan grabs Agent Zero by the back of the neck and hauls him
          out of the car.

          LOGAN
          Those were good people back there.
          Innocent people.
          Agent Zero surreptitiously pulls a commando knife from a
          sheath on his ankle.

          AGENT ZERO
          You ever notice good people tend to
          die when they spend time with you?
          He swings the knife at the side of Logan's neck.`Logan
          catches Agent Zero's wrist and slams it against the door
          frame.
          Agent Zero drops the knife with a pained smile. He didn't
          think that would work.

          Logan stands at a pay phone beside the Texaco station,

          tailslide on the curb. The kid loses his balance and wipes
          out, skinning his palms on the asphalt.

          Francis has a gentle smile as he feeds the lemurs leaf-eater
          biscuits. He speaks to them as they shriek,: clambering over
          his lap, biscuits clutched in their tiny hands.

          the heavy bag, tap at the speed bag, and jump rope.
          Logan walks toward a ring in the center of the gym. Two young
          BOXERS inside the ropes, wearing headgear and sparring
          gloves, dance around throwing quick jabs that don't land.
          JOHN WRAITH (45) stands outside the ring, watching this
          action with evident distaste. He wears a black cowboy hat,

          He glances at the boxers in the ring, who lean on the ropes
          and breathe heavily, awaiting instructions.

          a.k.a., THE BLOB, stands in the center of the aisle, tearing
          open bags of pork rinds and pouring them down his gullet.
          Dukes is the biggest man you've ever seen. By a long shot.
          Just shy of seven feet tall and weighing in at half a ton,
          he's beyond fat. Beyond obese.
          His eyes look like pinpricks in the swollen enormity of his
          face. When he shifts his bulk, ripples cascade down his
          flanks, his flesh trembling with each breath.

          LOGAN (O.S.)
          Jesus, Dukes...
          Dukes, mouth and chin dusted with fried pork skin, turns his
          head to examine the pest standing next to him.
          LOGAN (cont'd)
          Maybe it's time to give the pork
          rinds a rest.
          Dukes swings his arm. Despite his enormous mass, the man
          moves with surprising speed. Not quick enough to catch Logan,
          though, who ducks beneath the blow.
          Dukes's forearm, thicker than a fire hydrant, smashes through
          the steel shelving. Bags of pork rinds and potato chips
          tumble to the floor.

          Dukes grunts and bulls forward, toppling the heavily-laden
          shelves into the next aisle. Panicked SHOPPERS scream and run
          for the exits.
          Dukes blasts through the cereal aisle, too, with a great
          rending of steel, his giant shoes crushing boxes of Lucky
          Charms as he stomps into the produce section.

          Dukes bellows and runs at Logan. A coconut pelts him in the
          face, angering him further. Logan jumps out of the way as
          Dukes brings down his massive fists. Coconuts explode.
          Dukes charges after Logan, shattering watermelons, stacked
          grapefruits, clusters of bananas.
          After a thirty second rampage Dukes is exhausted, his giant
          chest heaving as he gasps for air, his hands and face
          splattered with remnants of crushed fruit.
          Logan jumps onto Dukes' back. The fat man roars and spins
          around, trying to buck the little rider, but Logan's got one
          arm wrapped around Dukes' throat and he's not letting go.
          The spinning makes Dukes a little dizzy and he slows down.
          Three adamantium claws shine in the big fellow's face,
          reflecting the overhead fluorescent lights.
          Dukes quits, his massive shoulders slumping. He sinks to his
          knees, his great bulk splitting the linoleum floor.

          EXT. CLUB SUPERIOR - NIGHT

          A heavy rain falls in the French Quarter. There is no sign
          outside the club, only.a gargantuan BOUNCER standing in front
          of an unmarked door in a dark alley.
          The bouncer apprises the stocky mutant walking his way.

          BOUNCER
          You superior?
          Only when we go CLOSE ON THE BOUNCER do we realize he has a
          single eye, large and bloodshot, centered in his forehead..
          Logan raises both hands. Snikt! A single claw extends from
          his right hand.

          the blade, and shows his wounded palm to the bouncer. The
          bouncer sees the wound heal and opens the door.
          BOUNCER (cont'd)
          Welcome home, brother.

          INT. CLUB SUPERIOR - MOMENTS LATER

          The dimly-lit club is the size of a warehouse and jammed with
          PARTYING MUTANTS. Most of them look like normal humans but a
          few are "overts," distinguished by curling horns, scaled skin
          and other genetic abnormalities.
          A sexy WAITRESS walks by with a tray of drinks. She winks at
          Logan. A "Kiss Me, I'm a Mutant" button is pinned to her
          shirt.
          Industrial beats pour out of speakers bolted to the ceilings.
          Logan surveys the room. A young PUSHER approaches, his long
          sideburns shaved into scimitars running down his jawline.

          PUSHER
          You lookin' for help, man? Ups,
          downs, in-betweens. What you need?

          LOGAN
          Wild roses for the moon.

          PUSHER
          Wild roses... That some new hash
          out of Amsterdam?

          LOGAN
          Something like that. You seen my

          The dealer points toward a staircase at the back of the club.

          what you're looking for.

          Logan tries to enter the VIP room but a muscle-bound SKINHEAD
          with Mutant Power brands on his biceps blocks his path.

          SKINHEAD
          Private party.

          LOGAN

          The skinhead raises his clipboard and examines the list.

          SKINHEAD
          Last name?
          Logan's fist splits the clipboard and crushes the skinhead's
          nose. The muscle-bound brute slumps to the floor,
          unconscious. Logan steps over him and into the VIP room.

          LOGAN

          INT. VIP ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          The VIP MUTANTS -sit at plush booths, downing shots of
          tequila. They grope their GIRLFRIENDS. They arm wrestle and
          compare tattoos and gobble down fried oysters.
          BARBARUS sits in a corner booth. He wears a custom-made wife-
          beater. The brutally-muscled mutant has four arms, all
          sleeved in tattoos.
          One hand pours himself a new glass of Jack Daniel's. A second
          hand gouges his name into the table top with a black steel
          commando knife. The third drums the beat of the current song
          on the vinyl booth's backrest.
          The fourth hand pets PANTERA, the nubile mutant sitting on
          his lap, a beautiful young woman entirely covered in
          glistening black fur. Her yellow eyes glitter.
          Logan approaches the table. Barbarus stares up at him.
          Pantera purrs, yellow eyes on Logan.

          BARBARUS

          Barbarus smiles, twenty fingers drumming on the table top.

          Some mutants need killing.

          LOGAN
          You got that right.
          Snikt!
          Barbarus shoves his girlfriend out of the way and stands,
          unsheathing three more black commando knives from his belt.
          The other MUTANTS quiet down, watching the fireworks.
          Barbarus swings, the four knives whistling through the air.
          Logan ducks under them and continues to bob and weave as
          Barbarus advances behind a whirlwhind of black steel.
          Logan slashes and one severed hand falls to the ground.
          Barbarus howls, stabbing at Logan with his three good arms.
          Logan's claws flash through the air again, and another neatly
          severed hand lands on the table.
          Logan retracts his claws and curls one finger: come at me.
          Barbarus, shamed and furious, gathers himself and charges.
          Logan times his punch perfectly, pivoting on the ball of his
          foot and hitting Barbarus with an uppercut that sounds like a
          well-hit baseball.
          Barbarus crashes to the floor. Pantera hisses and pounces at
          Logan, her black claws aimed at his face. Logan backhands
          her. She hits the floor and slides across the hardwood.

          INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

          A five-story concrete parking structure on the edge of Las
          Vegas. John Wraith walks to his black.'68 Mustang, whistling
          a Jerry Jeff Walker song.
          When he gets to the car he drops to the floor and checks the
          underbody for bombs. Nothing down there.
          He stands, reaching into his pocket for his keys.

          You think I'd use a bomb on you,

          Wraith spins around. Victor Creed sits on a concrete parapet,
          the desert wind blowing his filthy blonde hair.
          He hops off the parapet and walks toward Wraith.

          Wraith quickly unlocks the car door and get in. He slips the
          key into the ignition. The engine turns on the first try.
          Wraith hits the gas and the Mustang squeals out in reverse.
          He slams on the brakes, shifts into drive, and guns the car
          right at Creed.
          An instant before impact, Creed sidesteps the car and punches
          through the driver's window.
          It's a miracle of a punch, timed perfectly, a crushing shot
          to Wraith's jaw. Wraith loses control. of the car and it
          sideswipes a parked Hummer, spinning to a stop against a
          concrete wall.
          Wraith blinks and tries to clear his head. Creed reaches
          inside the broken window and hauls the Texan out. He lifts
          the bleeding man into the air and flashes his white fangs.

          That's the plan. It's a lot easier
          than finding him.
          Creed slams Wraith against the concrete wall and plunges his
          claws deep into Wraith's gut.
          The Texan's mouth opens as the full force of the pain hits
          him. Creed whispers in his ear.

          Carol Hines, the Army surgeon last seen in Alkali Lake,
          unlocks her front door and steps inside her house.
          she looks exhausted, with deep circles under her eyes. She
          puts her keys and the mail on a table by the door and then
          looks up, startled, when she hears SHRIEKING.
          Hines, very nervous, advances into the dark kitchen.
          She flicks on the lights. A red kettle on the stove top
          whistles. A mug waits on the counter. Hines, mystified, turns
          off the burner.

          a hand on her shoulder-- partly to steady her nerves, partly
          to keep pushing her forward.

          Hines and Logan walk down a long corridor. Several SOLDIERS
          and SCIENTISTS walk by, most of them ignoring the pair.
          One young scientist in a lab coat hurries past, nodding at
          Hines.

          Hines waits till Murphy passes. She stops in front of a
          locked door and allows a laser scanner to read her retina.
          The door slides open.
          Logan looks through the open doorway, his nostrils flaring.
          He looks primed for homicide.

          LOGAN
          I can smell him.
          He walks through the door. Hines checks to see if the coast
          is clear.and follows him. Neither notices the security camera
          mounted on the ceiling, swiveling to track their movement.

          INT. WEAPON XI FACILITY - DAY

          Logan and Hines stand at the top of a steel staircase, forty
          feet above the concrete floor of a massive cavern.
          Created in the 1960s by an underground hydrogen bomb test,
          the Alkali Lake cavern is the second biggest in the country,
          smaller only than the salt caverns of the Gulf Coast, home of
          the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

          The sheer scale of the place is staggering. Three times the
          size of the Super Dome, with walls of rough granite, the
          cavern is loud with the constant thrum of ventilation and
          high-powered machinery. Heavy steel pillars support the
          ceiling of the cavern.
          Ten thousand stainless steel isolation tanks crowd the floor,
          arrayed in a grid, each tank slightly larger than a coffin.
          TECHNICIANS walk in between the tanks, checking gauges,
          writing notes in clipboards.
          More technicians sit on a raised podium in the center of the
          cavern, overlooking the Eleven, entering information into the
          computers that monitor the sleeping army.
          Logan is awed by the sight. Hines has descended the staircase
          ahead of him. He follows after her.

          INT. HALLWAY - DAY

          Logan walks rapidly down the hallway, his pace accelerating
          as he nears a closed doorway. He rests his head against the
          door for a moment before putting his hand on the knob and
          entering the room.

          INT. STRYKER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          Stryker sits behind his desk, smiling at Logan. But Logan's
          not looking at the colonel. He's looking at the young woman
          who sits across from Stryker, her back to the door.
          She doesn't turn. Her long black hair cascades down her back.

          STRYKER
          Hello, old friend. We've been
          waiting for you.
          Logan walks toward the desk, slowly now, a man in a nightmare
          he can't wake from.
          STRYKER (cont'd)
          Did you really think we just let
          you walk away three years ago?
          You're a dangerous man, my friend.
          We like to keep an eye on dangerous
          men.
          When Logan reaches the young woman he puts his hand on her
          shoulder.
          Kayla Silverfox turns and stares up at him, tears streaming
          down her face.

          KAYLA
          I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
          An aluminum baseball bat whirs through the air, smashing the
          back of Logan's head.
          Logan falls to the floor, unconscious.
          Victor Creed stands above him, staring at the flattened
          barrel of the baseball bat.

          Creed tosses aside the bat and lifts Logan onto his shoulders
          as easily as a normal man would lift a child of six. He
          carries Logan out of the room, winking at Kayla.

          INT. RE-EDUCATION CHAMBER, ALKALI LAKE - DAY

          Logan, still unconscious, sits on a chair that looks far too
          similar to an electric chair, his arms and legs bound with
          titanium manacles that prevent any movement.
          The room looks like an execution chamber, complete with a
          viewing window.
          He opens his eyes and blinks in the bright light. Stryker and
          Creed stand in front of him but Logan doesn't look at them.
          Dr. Cornelius and an ASSISTANT stand near a machine that is
          wired to the electric chair, fiddling with the controls, but
          Logan doesn't look at them, either.
          He stares at Kayla, who cannot meet his eyes.

          Tell him. Tell him about the day

          speaks her voice is a strange monotone, devoid of feeling.

          They gave me a syringe full of

          Perhaps the colors are desaturated to let us know that this
          is a scene we've witnessed before, or thought we did.
          Kayla sits behind the wheel of her pickup. Victor Creed walks
          toward her, black talons raking five gashes on the hood.
          Kayla has been expecting him. She pulls her backpack out from
          behind the seat and takes from it a hypodermic needle and a
          plastic IV bag filled with dark blood.
          Creed tears the truck's door off its hinges and tosses it
          twenty yards. Kayla injects herself with the hypodermic.

          Reduces the heartbeat to almost
          zero. Breathing virtually stops.

          Victor, who casually pierces it with his claw.
          KAYLA (V.0.) (cont'd)
          I'd been drawing my own blood every
          night for the past week. I had four
          liters ready that morning.
          Kayla smears. her own blood on her body and empties the rest
          of the bag on the pavement. She lies down in the puddle in a
          fetal position, her breathing already beginning to slow.

          Stryker signals to Cornelius. The doctor and his assistant
          attach a nasty-looking copper halo to Logan's skull. The halo

          Kayla turns and walks out of the room. Cornelius and his aide
          follow, shutting the door behind them.
          Logan takes a deep breath. He looks like a man who is ready
          to forget everything.

          INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

          Hines sits alone on a metal cot. The cell door slides open.
          Stryker and Victor step inside.

          STRYKER
          Lieutenant. Victor and I were just
          discussing how to kill you and we
          thought you might have some
          suggestions.

          INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

          Silverfox steps out of the re-education chamber. She hears
          voices from the holding cell and approaches.

          STRYKER (O.S.)
          When the Turks captured a traitor,
          they strapped a steel basket to the
          man's stomach. Inside the basket
          was a rat.

          INT. HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS


          STRYKER
          Now, even a rat can't chew through
          steel. But it can chew through a
          stomach. So it would. Right through
          the skin and the fat and the muscle
          and the intestines, right on out
          the other side.

          STRYKER (cont'd)
          Victor thinks the Turks were soft,
          letting the rats do the dirty work.
          He's looking forward to spending
          your last night with you.

          HINES
          Please, Colonel--
          Stryker pats Hines on the cheek and nods to Victor.

          STRYKER
          Enjoy yourself.

          HINES
          Please don't do this... Please!
          Victor drags the screaming Hines off of her cot. Kayla
          watches with growing unease but Stryker smiles and- waves
          goodbye as he turns the key that shuts the cell door.

          Logan sits in his electric chair, staring straight ahead,
          preparing himself for the pain.

          Cornelius stands behind the glass viewing window with his

          Thousands of volts surge into Logan's skull, forcing his body
          to arch. After several seconds the power shuts off. Tendrils
          of white smoke rise from the copper halo.

          INT. STRYKER'S OFFICE - DAY

          Stryker signs a memo and hands it to his aide, Collins. Kayla
          stands by the window, picking at her fingers.

          KAYLA
          You're going to let Victor kill
          that woman.
          Stryker and Collins ignore her.
          KAYLA (cont'd)
          When you got me out of prison, you
          told me we were going to help
          people.
          Stryker continues to sign papers, never looking up.

          STRYKER
          We are. We're saving humanity.

          KAYLA
          From the mutants?
          The phone rings. Stryker answers it.

          STRYKER
          Yes?

          Good. I'm coming down.
          (hanging up; to Collins)
          The Eleven is ready.
          He stands and heads for the door. Collins follows. In the
          doorway, Stryker stops and fixes his cold blue gaze on Kayla.
          STRYKER (cont'd)
          Don't worry, my sweet. You're one
          of the good ones. I'll protect you.

          misery.

          Logan sits panting in the chair, gripping the ends of the arm
          rests with white fingers, waiting for the next surge of
          electricity. It comes and he arches again, all the muscles in
          his body contracting, the veins in his neck bulging.

          INT. VIEWING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Cornelius and his assistant watch Logan with no detectable
          sympathy. They turn when Kayla walks into the room.

          KAYLA
          Is he clean yet?
          Cornelius and the assistant face front again..

          CORNELIUS
          He's stronger than I thought. We
          could be here all night..
          Kayla watches Logan in his agony. A glimmer of remorse passes
          over her face.

          KAYLA
          He was good to me.
          Cornelius, fiddling with the amperage dial, curls his lips in
          a sardonic smile.

          CORNELIUS
          You have a funny way of showing
          your gratitude.
          Logan thrashes in his chair. Kayla chews her lip. For a long
          count she watches Logan suffer.

          KAYLA
          You should turn it off now.
          Cornelius turns and stares at her.

          CORNELIUS
          I should what?

          (BLINKING)
          Oh. I guess that's... I guess

          The assistant blinks and begins to scowl, turning toward
          Cornelius just in time to get punched in the mouth.
          The two men brawl on the floor with the lack of skill you'd
          expect from two scientists.

          INT. RE-EDUCATION CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

          Kayla steps into the room. Logan sits slumped motionless in
          the electric chair. She detaches the copper halo. The skin
          beneath the metal is singed but it quickly begins to heal.
          Kayla stares at the man she betrayed, hesitates for a moment
          and exhales.
          She unfastens the titanium manacles. Logan is still
          unconscious. Kayla shakes him gently.

          KAYLA
          Hey. Wake up.
          Logan opens his eyes. He is clearly disoriented, as if waking
          from a long coma. He stares up at Kayla.
          KAYLA (cont'd)
          Are you okay?
          Logan stares at her, groggy and confused.
          KAYLA (cont'd)
          Do you understand what I'm saying?

          (BEAT)
          Do you remember me?
          In one blinding motion, Logan snatches Kayla by the throat
          and roughly pulls her to him. She does not resist.

          Victor Creed holds Hines against the cell wall with one hand.
          Her feet kick in the air as she struggles.
          He splits her blouse down the middle with a long black talon.

          VICTOR CREED

          Creed turns his head and sees Logan and Kayla standing in the
          doorway.
          He grins and tosses Hines aside. She crashes into the wall
          and slides to the floor, dazed.

          VICTOR CREED

          What's he gonna do with us when the
          other mutants are dead? Put us in a

          Creed hesitates, considering the logic of her words. A fanged
          smile splits his face.

          VICTOR CREED
          Don't try your head games on me.
          I've gutted better telepaths than
          you.
          Creed rears back to hammer Kayla, a blow that would separate
          her head from her body.
          Logan catches Creed's fist inches from Kayla's face.

          LOGAN
          Time you quit picking on girls.

          VICTOR CREED
          Oh, I'm happy picking on men.
          Creed swings at Logan's head, Logan ducks, and the fight
          begins.
          This is melee so efficient that no motion is wasted. Every
          lunge would kill any other adversary. Every parried blow
          would shatter a normal man's arm.
          Kayla, bleeding from the nose, staggers to her feet. She
          helps up Hines and pushes her toward the door.

          KAYLA
          Get out of here.
          Hines doesn't have to be told twice. She flees. Creed sees
          his plaything running out the door. He snarls in frustration.

          VICTOR CREED
          You're ruining my party.
          He grabs hold of Logan and hurls him headfirst through the
          cell wall-- a concrete support wall.

          Logan crashes to the floor, covered in rubble. Creed steps
          out of the cell, licking his fangs.
          Creed tries to stomp Logan's face, but the smaller man rolls
          out of the way and gets back on his feet.
          The mutants battle down the corridor, claws whistling through
          the air.
          A team of SENTRIES charge around the corner, wearing tactical
          armor and carrying XM8 assault rifles. They level their
          rifles at the battling mutants.

          Logan and Creed, trying to punch holes in each other, ignore
          the sentries. Kayla, staring down the barrels of the big
          guns,. holds up her hands.
          She concentrates, staring into the sentries' eyes.

          KAYLA
          We're here as guests of Colonel
          Stryker.
          The sentries' hostility shifts into apologetic obeisance.

          SENTRY #1
          Very sorry about that.

          KAYLA
          You boys are no longer needed here.
          Go back to barracks.

          SENTRIES
          You got it. See ya later. Bye!
          The sentries wave cheerfully and depart.
          Creed and Logan are equally skilled, but Creed's superior
          size and strength begin to wear the smaller man down.
          Creed slams him into the wall, opening fissures. Holding both
          of Wolverine's wrists up with one hand, Creed grabs
          Wolverine's face with his free hand.

          Logan brings his knee up hard, smashing his adamantium-
          enhanced kneecap into Creed's groin.
          The big man groans. Logan spins Creed around, jamming him
          against the wall. He tries to skewer Creed with the claws of
          his right hand but Creed moves his head at the last moment.
          Logan's claws are buried to the hilt-in the wall. He strikes
          at Creed with his left hand, but Creed dodges again. All six
          of Logan's claws are deep in the solid rock wall.
          He brings his hands. together, the adamantium blades slicing
          through granite as if it were cheesecake.
          Creed ducks under the claws an instant before they shred him.
          He grabs Logan in a-bear hug.
          A large section of the wall behind them falls out, and,
          unable to halt their momentum, Logan and Creed tumble through
          the hole, disappearing from sight.
          Kayla runs over and stands at the jagged precipice, looking
          out onto the gargantuan Weapon XI cavern.

          Logan and Creed fall seventy feet, clawing at each other in
          mid-air.
          Logan hits the floor hard, the impact blasting a small crater
          in the concrete.
          Creed manages a rolling fall, cat-quick and dexterous.

          talons.
          Creed batters Logan with a series of savage blows. Logan
          falls, his healing factor overwhelmed, barely conscious.
          Creed plants one heavy black boot on Logan's face and presses

          berserker.

          Stryker sees Logan walking toward him, toward the hordes of
          clones. Stryker shakes his head and smiles.

          STRYKER
          The man's committing suicide.
          He leans into the microphone. The Eleven listen to their
          commander's voice, amplified by hundreds of speakers
          STRYKER (cont'd)
          No army that ever marched could
          stand against you! You will never
          abandon your mission, and your
          mission is simple! Kill the
          mutants! Kill them wherever you
          find them!
          Stryker points at Logan.
          STRYKER (cont'd)

          THIS IS YOUR FIRST ENEMY!
          Ten thousand cloned murderers turn on Logan, soulless black
          eyes focusing on their target.
          Logan stops his march beside one of the massive steel pillars.
          that supports the cavern ceiling.

          LOGAN
          (to Kayla)
          Get the hell out of here.

          KAYLA
          What are you doing?

          LOGAN
          Bringin' down the house.
          He sweeps his claws clean through the pillar, at an angle.
          The uppermost section shears off and drills into the floor
          with a concussive whump that spiderwebs the concrete for
          thirty feet around the impact site.
          Stryker realizes what Logan is doing.

          STRYKER

          ATTACK! ATTACK!
          The Eleven charge. From above we can see the full-scale of
          the onslaught, wave upon wave of cloned murderers closing in.

          98.

          CONTINUED: (4)
          Logan runs to the next pillar and slices through it. Creaks
          and groans sound overhead, as the tremendous weight above
          exerts pressure on the remaining weight-bearing supports.
          Most of the ten thousand can't get close to Logan, but they
          all want in on the first kill.
          Whirling, slashing, stabbing, kicking, Logan scythes a circle
          of devastation, spray-painting the floor with the black blood
          of the Eleven.
          He reaches a third pillar and chops through it.
          Kayla eyes the ceiling nervously and hurries toward the exit.
          STRYKER (cont'd)

          STOP HIM, YOU IDIOTS! STOP HIM!
          Even Logan can't hold back the tide for long. Talons rake his
          face, his arms, his chest. But still he battles, slicing
          through a fourth pillar, a fifth.
          Tremendous fissures split the rock ceiling. Dust and rocks
          fall onto the cavern floor as the fissures widen.
          Logan sees that the cavern's collapse is imminent. He can no
          longer hold off the Eleven's assault.
          An instant before the clones can shred him, he jumps, using
          his claws to scale one of the still-standing steel pillars
          with the grace and speed of a leopard climbing a tree.
          One of the clones follows, using his black talons in the same
          fashion, grabbing at Logan's feet.
          When Logan is forty feet above the throng of teeth-gnashing
          clones, he severs the pillar below his feet. The clone
          chasing him can climb no farther, can do nothing but roar and
          hiss at his escaping prey.
          Logan swings himself onto the steel staircase, where Kayla
          waits beside the open door. He races up the stairs.
          Stryker sees his dream in ruins. He runs for the nearest
          exit.
          Kayla and Logan are a few feet from the door, from safety,
          when the cavern ceiling gives out. Thousands of tons of stone
          and steel come crashing down.
          Logan grabs Kayla and hauls her to safety an instant before
          she would be crushed.

          EXT. ALKALI LAKE - DAY

          The compound has essentially imploded, the major structures
          falling into the massive pit created by the cavern's
          collapse.
          Severed gas lines and ruptured boilers have turned the crater
          into a raging fire pit. Smoke billows up from the molten
          core.
          A few dazed survivors, SOLDIERS and SCIENTISTS, have escaped
          the carnage, but Alkali Lake no longer exists as a military
          base. Thousands of singed documents flutter in the wind.
          Logan and Kayla walk away from the burning crater, never
          looking back. They head through the woods toward the lake
          that glitters in the sunlight.

          KAYLA
          One of them could have survived.
          Logan glances at her.
          KAYLA (cont'd)
          The clones. They've got your
          healing factor.
          Logan looks back at the devastation.

          LOGAN
          Unless someone comes along who can
          move a few million tons of steel,
          they ain't going anywhere.

          EXT. ALKALI LAKE - LATER

          They stop at the edge of the lake. Paper from the destroyed
          base drifts through the air, falling on the water and the
          shore.

          LOGAN
          Almost looks peaceful from here.

          KAYLA
          There's something I want you to
          know.
          He looks at her.

          Maybe nothing I say matters
          anymore. But I'm going to say it
          anyway. I...
          A blossom of blood opens up on her chest. She stares down at
          it in wonder before sinking to her knees.
          Logan turns and sees Stryker walking toward them.
          KAYLA (cont'd)
          No...
          Stryker fires again. The adamantium bullet rips through
          Logan's forehead with an unholy sound.
          Logan falls to the ground. Stryker stands above him and fires
          another bullet into Logan's head.
          Stryker turns the gun on Kayla.
          KAYLA (cont'd)
          You don't need to waste another
          bullet. I'm already dead.
          Stryker blinks and hesitates. Kayla coughs, her strength
          beginning to fade.
          KAYLA (cont'd)
          Maybe you should turn that gun on
          yourself, Colonel.
          Stryker nods, pointing the gun at his own head.
          KAYLA (cont'd)
          It would be good for the mutants if
          I made you pull the trigger..

          (BEAT)
          Why do you hate us so much?
          Stryker's finger trembles on the trigger.
          KAYLA (cont'd)
          Is it because your son is one of
          us?
          For the first time, perhaps, we see something human in the
          cold blue of Stryker's eyes.
          KAYLA (cont'd)
          Enough killing, Colonel. Throw your
          gun in the lake.

          CONTINUED: (2)
          Stryker does as he's told. The revolver sinks into the water.
          KAYLA (cont'd)
          Leave us. Keep walking till your
          feet start to bleed.
          Stryker turns and walks away.
          Kayla crawls over to Logan. She lifts his head onto her lap.
          He's unconscious but breathing. The bullet holes in his skin
          have already healed. She strokes his jaw. and smiles sadly.
          One of the scraps of paper from the base blows against her
          leg. She takes it and looks down at the blank page.
          She has no pen. She touches her chest, just above her heart,
          wetting her finger with her blood.
          She writes four words on the page, blows on it to dry it,
          folds it once and places it in Logan's hand.
          She kisses his lips and rests his head gently on the ground.
          Fighting the pain, a dying woman, Kayla manages to stand.
          KAYLA (cont'd)
          If you ever remember what I did to
          you, try to forgive me. I was a
          fool. And you were right... I
          always loved you.
          She turns and walks toward the lake, never looking back,
          never hesitating as the waters rise above her knees, above
          her waist, above her shoulders, above her head.

          EXT. ALKALI LAKE - SUNSET

          Logan's eyes flutter and open. For a moment he squints into
          the blue sky.
          He sits up, looking around. The woods are empty.
          He stands, completely disoriented, a stranger in the world.
          He realizes that he's holding a piece of paper in his hand.
          He unfolds it and reads the message written in blood.
          You are my Wolverine.
          He stares at it for a moment before folding it carefully and
          putting it in his pocket.

          CONTINUED:
          He takes a deep breath of cold air and walks west, toward the
          falling sun.
          He doesn't know who he is. He doesn't know where he's going.
          But the wind blows through his hair, the last of the sunlight
          feels good on his skin. He is a free man.
          He walks toward his destiny..
