                                        Fourth Draft: 1 June 1998

                         


          1. Film opens with beautiful shot of the skyline of
          downtown Baltimore in the spring. Credits begin.
          Cut to "The Hippodrome Theater," one-time downtown movie
          palace, now abandoned and boarded up with broken and
          blank marquee. The credits to our movie continue by
          fading in on marquee.

          Cut to thriving "Harbor Court" theaters, downtown
          chain. All six marquees list the same two
          mega-budget Hollywood hits. Hollywood titles fade
          out and "Cecil B. DeMented" title logo fades into
          marquee in all its terrorist glory.

          Cut to old "Towson Theater." A "FOR RENT" sign is
          on marquee of this one-time neighborhood theater.
          "FOR RENT" sign fades out and our credits fade in
          on marquee.

          Cut to "Towson Commons," a modern cineplex down the
          street. All the titles listed on marquee are
          sequels. Sequel titles fade out and our credits
          fade in on marquee.

          Cut to "5 West Theater," one-time art house. The
          marquee now announces "Sunday Church Service" which
          fades out and our credits continue, fading in.
          Cut to "Westview Mall," suburban multiplex, all
          the titles listed on marquee are recent Hollywood
          comedy bombs. The Hollywood titles fade out and our
          credits fade in.

          Cut to "New Theater," once a popular downtown premiere
          spot. The marquee reads C-L-O-S-E-D in badly spaced
          letters. The letters fade out and our credits fade in.
          2. Cut to wide shot of EXTERIOR SENATOR THEATER, 2.
          Baltimore's landmark art-deco movie palace. Marquee

          "SOME KIND OF HAPPINESS"
          Marquee letters fade out and our credits fade in.
          Cut to blocks of cement out front of the theater similar
          to Grauman's Chinese Theater in Los Angeles. Each
          displays the logo of a film title that was shot on
          location in Baltimore and premiered at this theater;
          "Diner," "The Accidental Tourist," "And Justice For

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         3
          All." Our credits are intercut in the cement blocks as
          the camera pans across this local tourist attraction.
          Cut to SINCLAIR STEVENS, the handsome but intense
          20-year-old theater manager as he adjusts the final
          letter of the film's title on the marquee, perched atop
          a ladder. SINCLAIR is dressed in an obviously rented
          tuxedo and for a moment seems like any other middle
          class suburban kid.

          ROY STILLINGS, the tuxedoed fifty-year-old theater
          owner, shouts instructions from below as CATERERS,
          DECORATORS and PUBLICITY PEOPLE rush in an out of
          theater preparing for tonight's event. He is
          surrounded by several of his young staff - DINAH, the
          sourpussed but unconventionally striking cashier;
          CHARDONNAY, the African-American ticket-taker with a
          huge 90's hairdo so popular with the black girls in
          Baltimore; RAVEN, the happy and always smiling pretty
          usherette, and FIDGET, the dweebish but somehow sexy
          janitor. All have made an attempt to dress up their
          usual uniforms for the premiere.

                        MR. STILLINGS
          A little more to the right,
          Sinclair.

                         SINCLAIR
          (Moving the final "S"

                         IN "HAPPINESS")
          That better, Mr. Stillings?
          Title on marquee fades out and "Produced by..." credit
          fades in.

                        MR. STILLINGS

                         (SQUINTING)
          Yeah, that's good.

                         (STILL UNSATISFIED)
          But try moving the "K" in "Whitlock."
          A little to the left.

                         SINCLAIR
          (Following his boss's instructions,
          the "Some Kind Of Happiness" title
          back on the marquee)
          Have you met her yet?

                        MR. STILLINGS
          Not yet. But don't worry,
          Sinclair, I'll introduce you!

                         SINCLAIR
          You promise?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          SINCLAIR smiles sneakily to himself as "Some Kind Of
          Happiness" logo fades out on marquee and "Written and
          Directed by John Waters" credit fades in.

                         SINCLAIR

                         (EVILLY)
          I'm a bg fan!

          End of credits.

          3. Cut to EXTERIOR HARBOR COURT, luxury downtownhotel. 3.
           Movie fans of all ages, clutch 8x10's of Honey
          Whitlock and eagerly await her departure.

          4. INTERIOR "PRESIDENTIAL SUITE" OF HARBOR COURT HOTEL. 4.
          HONEY WHITLOCK turns from beautiful Inner Harbor view
          outside hotel window and we see she is about forty
          years old and a complete knockout.

                         HONEY
          Ah, what a town!
          HONEY is dressed for the premiere in an elegant evening
          gown and her black hair is cut perfectly in the Louise
          Brooks style that has become her signature. She
          continues her press conference under the watchful eyes
          of her press agent CHARLES and her long-time assistant
          LIBBY, both of whom are also dressed for the premiere.
          ROOM SERVICE employees stand by, ready to serve.

                         HONEY
          I tell everybody in Hollywood,
          when you shoot on location in
          Baltimore, you don't need to
          bring all the crew from Los
          Angeles. Baltimore really ia the
          best!...

          5. Cut back to INTERIOR LOBBY OF SENATOR THEATER. 5.
          MR. STILLINGS lectures his other staff members as
          CATERERS and BARTENDERS set up behind him. SINCLAIR
          STEVENS is paying close attention as is LYLE, the
          projectionist, a handsome but surprisingly gaunt young
          man. CHERISH, a sexy and slightly nasty candy-counter
          girl leers at SINCLAIR who flirts back as she feigns
          interest in MR. STILLINGS' pep talk. PAM the popcorn
          girl, a masculine but beautiful nineteen year old with a
          seemingly bad attitude and LEWIS, the young cool
          African-American usher with a chip on his shoulder join
          FIDGET, RAVEN and DINAH.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         5

                      MR. STILLINGS
          and remember, Miss Whitlock
          is every inch a movie star and
          expects to be on stage at exactly
          7:10pm to ensure live coverage
          from all three local news shows.
          By the way, I hear she's really
          a nice person...

          6. INTERIOR HONEY'S HOTEL ROOM. 6.
          HONEY's mean face glares out window at the twinkling
          lights of Baltimore's Inner Harbor in the early
          evening.

                         HONEY
          Look at this dump of a town!
          HONEY turns to her long suffering assistant, LIBBY.
          The press is gone and they are alone.

                         HONEY
          Get me the fuck back to L.A. If
          one more asshole mentions a crab
          cake to me, I think I'll puke.

                         LIBBY
          (Trying to be positive)
          Did you try the steamed crabs?
          They're red and...

                         HONEY
          No I didn't! I'm not interested
          in any kind of meal you have to
          beat with a mallet...
          A knock is heard at hotel door.

                         HONEY

                         (SUDDENLY NICE)
          Just a minute...
          (Muttering to herself as
          LIBBY goes to answer door)
          .wearing some stupid kind of bib
          while families of mutants gawk in
          my face ...No thank you!
          CHARLES, the press agent enters.

                         CHARLES
          Your limousine is here, Miss
          Whitlock. You look beautiful.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         HONEY
          (Back to being gracious)
          Thank you Charles, darling. We'll
          be right with you. I'm excited.
          CHARLES exits.

                         HONEY
          (Back to her nasty self)
          Do you think Pat Nixon got
          fucked in this hotel room?

                         LIBBY

                         (STUPEFIED)
          Well ...I don't know...I mean...

                         HONEY
          It's called the "Presidential
          Suite" isn't it?

                         LIBBY
          Yes...but...

                         HONEY
          I BET SHE DID! Call the
          manager and ask him!

                         LIBBY

                         (HORRIFIED)
          I can't ask that. . .Pat Nixon
          was a stroke victim...

                         HONEY
          It's your ï¿½ to ask, Libby!
          Call downstairs and find out
          if Pat Nixon got fucked in my
          hotel room! I want to know!

          7. EXTERIOR SENATOR THEATER. 7.
          Large crowd of fans and gawkers let out a roar of
          approval as the klieg lights are switched on by WORKMAN
          and the night sky is lit up by the criss-crossing beams
          of light.

          8. INTERIOR HALLWAY OF HARBOR COURT HOTEL. 8.
          HONEY WHITLOCK, looking incredibly glamorous, is being
          led downstairs by CHARLES, the press agent and RODNEY,
          a young biker-type bodyguard assigned to her for the
          night by the theater. He wears an ill-fitting polyester
          suit and an earphone. LIBBY hurries to catch up with
          them.

                         LIBBY
          (Reading from notes)
          The hotel manager said "No."
          Pat Nixon never stayed here,
          but Nancy Reagen did in 1986...

                         HONEY

                         (AMAZED)
          You didn't actually ask him?

                         LIBBY

                         (CONFUSED)
          You said to call downstairs...

                         HONEY

                         (APPALLED)
          You asked the hotel manager if
          Pat Nixon had sex in my room?

                         LIBBY
          Well. . .sort of. I mean you
          told me...

                         HONEY
          I was kidding Libby. He must
          think you're a complete lunatic!
          Good God, you'd do anything!
          A HOTEL MAID pushing a cart of towels and bathroom
          supplies comes around a corner and is completely
          star-struck.

                         MAID
          Good luck, Miss Whitlock!
          HONEY's face freezes in horror as elevator doors
          open and she is led inside.

          9. INTERIOR ELEVATOR. 9.
          Several well-dressed hotel guests recognize HONEY
          and are thrilled.

                         HONEY
          (In a sudden tirade)
          Did you hear what that little
          bitch said to me?

                         LIBBY
          She didn't know.

                         HONEY
          In show business we say "break a
          leg." NEVER fucking "Good Luck"!

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         8
          HOTEL GUESTS frown in disappointment at HONEY's
          language.

                         LIBBY

                         (TO HONEY)
          That's just an old superstition.

                         CHARLES

                         (NERVOUSLY)
          Miss Whitlock, there's photo cps
          with the mayor in the lobby...

                         HONEY
          That cocksucker put a curse
          on my whole fucking premiere!
          HOTEL GUESTS let out a cry of shock at HONEY's
          language.

          10. INTERIOR HOTEL LOBBY. 10.
          MAYOR FENWICK, the middle aged African American mayor
          waits with the PRESS.
          HONEY steps off the elevator completely composed to a
          burst of flashbulbs.

                         HONEY
          Mayor Fenwick!
          LIBBY and CHARLES look to one another relieved as
          HOTEL GUESTS stumble out of elevator, shaking their
          heads in disgust.

                         MAYOR
          Miss Whitlock, what an honor!
          They pose together as PRESS snaps away.

                         HONEY
          I love what you've done with
          this city.

                         MAYOR
          And Baltimore loves you back!
          (Takes out proclamation)
          I, Adam Fenwick, Mayor of the
          City of Baltimore, do hereby
          proclaim April 29th to be Honey
          Whitlock Day in Maryland and do
          command this observation to all
          of our citizens. Whereas...

          11. EXTERIOR FRONT ENTRANCE HARBOR COURT. 11.
          Limos await dignitaries for publicity cavalcade to
          Senator Theater premiere.
          PETIE, a 22-year-old hillbilly tough guy, dressed in
          a chauffeur's uniform sits behind the wheel of a white
          limousine as HONEY and MAYOR and their entourages make
          their way to limos followed by PRESS.

                         PETIE
          (Looking at watch and sneakily
          speaking into walkie-talkie)
          6:41pm.

                         (SMILING EVILLY)
          A star is born...

          12. INTERIOR PROJECTION BOOTH SENATOR THEATER. 12.
          SINCLAIR STEVENS hears PETIE on earphones to his
          walkie-talkie.

                         SINCLAIR
          (Whispering into walkie)
          10-4, Petie.
          SINCLAIR nods gravely to LYLE the projectionist who
          picks up a 35mm metal film can and sneaks up behind
          MR. STILLINGS who is looking down from projection
          booth to the premiere CROWD filling the theater below.

          MR. STILLINGS
          Christ, there's what's-her-name
          from E Network. Look at the
          tits on her!
          LYLE hits MR. STILLINGS over the head with the film
          can.

                         SINCLAIR
          (In full command, over walkie,

                         CHECKING WATCH)
          6:43pm. Hit it, "SPROCKET HOLES."

          13. INTERIOR SENATOR THEATER. REFRESHMENT STAND. 13.
          PAM, the popcorn girl, wearing ear phones, as are
          all the "SPROCKET HOLE" gang, grabs a 9mm gun hidden

          CHARDONNAY rifles pocketbooks of SOCIETY LADIES and
          steals their wallets as they cower in fear on the

          44. EXTERIOR SENATOR THEATER. 44.
          Complete pandemonium as premiere AUDIENCE comes
          stampeding out of theater in a panic.
          MOTORCYCLE COP ESCORTS leap from motorcycles and pull
          guns but PETIE jumps from limo, grabs a piece of
          lumber from sawhorse and knocks them unconscious with

          it.
          DINAH comes running, firing into the air, and throws
          bags of money into back of limo and jumps in.
          CHERISH, LYLE, RAVEN, FIDGET, CHARDONNAY and PAM come
          charging out of theater, firing their guns to cover
          their escape.
          CECIL drags HONEY outside, still in a chokehold as
          RODNEY fires wildly to keep anyone at bay.

                         HONEY
          (To HORRIFIED FANS who
          duck for cover)

          HELP ME! CALL THE STUDIO!

          CALL JACK VALENTI! HELLLPPP!
          PETIE opens the trunk of the limo and RODNEY and CECIL
          throw HONEY inside and slam it shut. HONEY continues
          screaming and banging on trunk door as CECIL and GANG
          pile into limo.

                         CECIL

                         (TO GANG)

          POWER TO THE PEOPLE WHO

          PUNISH BAD CINEMA!
          PETIE peels out in limo as PREMIERE GUESTS and FANS
          dive out of the way and GANG chants "Battle of
          Algiers"-type revolutionary yell.
          CECIL fires his gun out back window and shatters the
          "Some Kind Of Happiness" logo on marquee.

          45. INTERIOR SPEEDING LIMO. 45.
          CHERISH lunges for CECIL and they french kiss hotly.
          From PETIE's POV behind the wheel we see COP CAR #1
          with sirens wailing and lights flashing heading
          towards premiere.
          In rear view mirror, PETIE sees three other COP CARS
          speeding up to Senator Theater and screeching to a
          stop.

          46. EXTERIOR YORK ROAD. NORTH OF SENATOR THEATER. 46.

          Back window is blasted out by COP's bullet.

                         CECIL
          I fuckin' hate car chase scenes!

                         PETIE
          (Flooring the accelerator,

                         PISSED)
          Yeah, but "Bullit" was good!
          LYLE snorts cocaine off a coke-spoon and nonchalantly
          picks glass out of his hair.

                         LYLE
          But it lead to the "French
          Connection."

                         CHARDONNAY

                         (VICIOUSLY)
          Which inspired a sequel!

                         LEWIS
          And lead to "Smokey and The
          Bandit" and that kinda shit!
          PETIE sees another cop car speeding up behind him in
          the rear view mirror.
          DINAH leans out limo window and fires gun back'at
          cop car.

                         PAM

                         (FURIOUS)
          "Smokey and The Bandit"
          even had fuckin' sequels...
          Another cop car speeds towards them from the front
          trying to cut them off.

                         PETIE
          (Insane, driving like a lunatic)
          Yeah, Part fucking Two, 1980!...

                         DINAH

                         (IN DISGUST)
          Part Three, 1983!

                         (PSYCHOTICALLY)
          "Smokey and The Bandit"
          ruined my childhood!
          CECIL fires his gun in the nick of time and shatters
          approaching cop car's windshield.

          PETIE makes a hard right and zooms up church driveway
          as two cop cars collide behind him.
          FIDGET cheers like a kid and starts absentmindedly
          playing pocket pool.

          48. EXTERIOR CHURCH ROAD. 48.
          Another cop car is speeding to premiere from behind
          the church and almost hits the limo as PETIE veers
          right in the "V" in the road, narrowly missing a
          MINISTER and a suspiciously SENSITIVE TEEN as they
          leave the church rectory.

                         CHERISH
          (Yelling out window)
          Long live pornography!

          49. EXTERIOR ONE-WAY STREET. 49.
          PETIE speeds limo the wrong way past one-way sign
          into path of oncoming speeding cop car.
          In the nick of time, PETIE turns a hard left
          skidding around corner onto bumpy cemetery road behind
          church.
          Cop car swerves right to avoid collision and careens
          into CABLE TV installation truck.
          COP jumps out of car and starts firing at limo.

          50. INTERIOR SPEEDING LIMO. 50.
          CHARDONNAY puts tape into limo cassette player and
          the entire GANG starts singing along with original
          gangsta rap song entitled "SHE'S A BANKABLE BITCH (and
          we don't need no pitch)."

          51. EXTERIOR CEMETERY ROAD. 51.
          COP fires again and hits limo trunk lock.
          Trunk door flies open and HONEY screams her lungs out,
          holding on for dear life.
          HEAVY METAL KIDS, hanging out in graveyard look up and
          see RAVEN yelling out car window with HONEY in trunk.

                         RAVEN
          (Imitating "The Exorcist")
          Your mother sucks cocks in hell!
          HEAVY METAL KIDS look at each other in horror and run

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         - 22 -
          away in fear.
          Limo bumps down road at high speed and trunk door
          bangs shut, knocking HONEY into submission.
          Limo makes a fast right.

          52 SUBURBAN INTERSECTION. 52
          Traffic is stopped in both lanes for a red light.
          PETIE screeches to a sudden stop. HE checks rear-view
          mirror and realizes they have escaped their POLICE
          pursuers.

                         PETIE

                         (TO GANG)
          We did it.
          PETIE grabs RODNEY from back seat and gives him a
          big kiss.
          A SUBURBAN LADY pulls up in her car next to limo
          on right.

                         SUBURBAN LADY
          Sinclair, is that you?
          PETIE turns down radio and GANG freezes.

                         CECIL
          (Suddenly turning into
          his old self)
          Hi, Mrs. Waltrup.

                         SUBURBAN LADY
          Did you win the lottery?

                         CECIL

                         (POLITELY)
          No, ma'am, we were at a
          movie premiere.

                         SUBURBAN LADY
          I don't go to the movies
          much, I wait for the video.

                         CECIL
          Not me, I like the big screen.

                         SUBURBAN LADY
          Say hello to your mom and
          dad for me.

                         CECIL
          I sure will.
          SUBURBAN LADY makes right on red and pulls off.

                         CECIL
          (Smugly, to GANG)
          Casting has been completed!
          PETIE peels out in other direction.
          53. Cut to EXTERIOR "SPROCKET HOUSE," a run-down, 53.
          seemingly abandoned warehouse in an industrial part
          of t:he city. The moon is full and the quiet is
          interrupted by faint sirens in the distance.
          Suddenly, like a low-rent Bat Cave, the large
          industrial garage doors swing open and the white
          limo speeds inside.
          54. Dissolve to INTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. HONEY's 54.
          "dressing room"; a bizarrely decorated prison cell
          fit for a movie queen.
          HONEY is blindfolded, gagged and tied to a director's
          chair with her name printed on the back, still
          wearing her torn and soiled premiere gown.
          LEWIS, now dressed in terrorist punk outfit removes
          HONEY's blindfold and gag as she sputters in terror.
          We see LEWIS has D-A-V-I-D L-Y-N-C-H tattooed on his
          fingers.
          HONEY's e yes light up in terror as she sees CECIL, now
          attired in insane grunge Cecil B. DeMille inspired
          outfit being lowered by PETIE on jerry-rigged film
          crane. "Otto Preminger" is tattooed on CECIL's bicep.

                         CECIL
          .Hello, I'm Cecil B. DeMented
          and I'm your new director...
          HONEY stares in confused horror.

                         CECIL
          I'd like you to meet your
          co-stars ...I call them the
          "Sprocket Holes."
          HONEY looks over in fear as the SPROCKET HOLES, now
          changed from their theater uniforms into their own
          scary "terrorist chic" fashions, gather around CECIL in a
          "crew-shot from hell" pose.

                         CECIL
          This is Cherish...
          CHERISH, now heavily made-up and dressed "riot-girl"
          style, in a "SINEMA" T-shirt, steps forward. We see
          "Andy Warhol" tattooed on her thigh.

                         CHERISH
          Hi, I played you in lots of
          porno movies. "Some Kind Of
          Happiness"? I've already shot
          it - only it's called "Some
          Kind Of Horniness."

                         (PROUDLY)
          But that's all behind me. I'm
          an outlaw cinema girl now.

                         CECIL
          Lyle?
          LYLE takes a big huff of glue in plastic bag and
          steps forward. He is dressed in scarily in 1970's
          junky wear meets 90's Hollywood sleaze, and sports a
          "Herschell Gordon Lewis" tattoo across his skinny chest.

                         LYLE
          Hi, I'm Lyle and I'm your
          leading man. I've had a
          boner for you for years.
          HONEY pales.

                         CECIL
          (Getting off crane and
          stepping towards HONEY)
          Don't worry, we've all taken a
          vow of celibacy for celluloid.
          No one gets laid until we've
          finished our movie. We're horny...
          CHERISH starts writhing sexily.

                         CECIL
          .but our film comes first.
          CECIL gently shoves her away as SPROCKET HOLES
          undulate in sexual frustration.

                         CECIL
          .And now for the crew.
          PAM the popcorn girl swaggers over carrying a beat-up
          vintage 16mm movie camera and aims it at HONEY's face.
          She is wearing a black para-military jump suit and we

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         - 25 -
          see her "Sam Peckinpah" tattoo on her arm.

                         PAM
          I'm Pam, the director of
          photography and you'd better
          hit your mark!
          CHARDONNAY, now done up in outrageous homegirl
          gangster look, carries an old wrecked Nagra sound
          recorder and spins her microphone boom pole like
          lethal numchucks before raising it over HONEY's
          head, revealing the "Spike Lee" tattoo on her stomach.

                         CHARDONNAY
          .and remember - SPEAK UP, BITCH!
          I'm Chardonnay and I do the sound.
          LEWIS proudly steps forward, menacingly holding
          staple gun like a weapon.

                         LEWIS
          We met. I'm Lewis, the art
          director. I hope you'll be
          comfortable here...
          HONEY looks around cell and sees giant stills blown up
          from her past films showing her in physical and
          emotional distress.

                         LEWIS

                         (MOVING CLOSER)
          .'cause you ain't goin'
          nowhere else!
          HE staples her gown to the chair.
          FIDGET, the grunge dweeb, dressed in complete rags but
          looking somehow great with his "William Castle" tattoo,
          shyly steps forward, absentmindedly playing "pocket
          pool."

                         FIDGET

                         (BASHFUL)
          I'm Fidget, the costumer...
          (Suddenly rips dress to give
          her a plunging neckline)
          Sorry.. .but I'm gonna have to
          give you a new look...
          RAVEN, smiling beatifically, steps forward dressed
          in a satanic robe, an inverted cross necklace,
          pentagram jewelry and a "Kenneth Anger" tattoo.

                         RAVEN
          Hi, I'm Raven and I'm a Satanist.
          I'll be doing your makeup...
          HONEY stares back in confusion.

                         RAVEN
          You look so pale...
          RAVEN suddenly slaps HONEY across face and HONEY
          cries out in shock.

                         RAVEN
          Sorry... but Satan says...
          you need color!
          RODNEY, the biker "bodyguard," now in S&M leather
          get-up steps toward HONEY carrying a rat-tail comb
          and a hair dye applicator bottle. His "Almodovar"
          tattoo is a beauty.

                         RODNEY
          Call me Rodney. Tomorrow
          I'm bleaching your hair out
          platinum and I should warn
          you...I FUCKING HATE ROOTS!
          PETIE, the sexy hillbilly "chauffeur," now dressed
          in redneck militant garb and featuring a "Fassbinder"
          tattoo, steps forward.

                         PETIE
          Hey, I'm Petie, remember me,
          "the trailer trash"? I'll be
          your driver. I'll take you
          anywhere... anywhere but home!!

                         CARESSES RODNEY)
          From behind a curtain, covering a room of lab and
          editing equipment comes DINAH, now dressed in
          alarming vintage fashion outfit that shows off her
          shapely but purposely hairy legs. "Sam Fuller" is
          tattooed on her back. She wheels a TV set and VCR
          mounted on wheels framed by little velvet curtain.

                         DINAH
          (Snarling to HONEY)
          I'm Dinah, Cecil's prodÂ»cer
          and I do everything! I've
          been knocking down box office
          money from every big Hollywood

          and you're DEAD!
          (Smugly to CECIL)
          We made the news...
          CECIL nods to DINAH to turn on the VCR to show clip
          taped from TV.

                         NEWSMAN
          . So once again, our top story.
          Sylvia Mallory, the fifty-two
          year old chairwoman of the
          Maryland Heart Fund died tonight
          at Union Memorial Hospital
          following an on stage heart
          attack she suffered in the middle
          of Honey Whitlock's kidnapping at
          tonight's Baltimore movie
          premiere...
          SPROCKET HOLES stare in amazement at TV screen, the
          enormity of their act barely sinking in.

                         NEWSMAN
          .the teenage gang of cinema
          terrorists who apparently
          infiltrated the staff of the
          Senator Theater are now eligible
          for the death penalty in the
          State of Maryland...
          CECIL nods to DINAH to turn it off, which she does.
          SPROCKET HOLES gulp and look to their leader for
          guidance.
          CECIL steps forward, getting right in HONEY's
          terrified face.

                         CECIL
          Miss Whitlock, we're going to
          make our first film and NOBODY'S
          going to stop us. Lots of kids
          dream of making a movie...
          SPROCKET HOLES smile in brain-washed enthusiasm.

                         CECIL
          .but only the ones willing
          to dia for it succeed.
          HONEY looks into CECIL's face and lets out a sob of
          terror.

          55. Fade in to EXTERIOR "SPROCKET HOUSE." Next morning. 55.
           We hear HONEY letting out a fresh cry of agony.

          56. INTERIOR "SPROCKET HOUSE" - "HAIR AND MAKEUP," 56.
          a dilapidated section of the loft filled with broken
          mirrors, beat up barber chairs, filthy hair driers
          and mangy beauty supplies.
          HONEY, tied to a barber chair, still dressed in her
          raggedy premiere gown, moans in pain as RODNEY, in
          scary rubber fetish outfit, sadistically
          applies the final batch of double strength bleach to
          HONEY's already shockingly blond hair.
          RAVEN, wearing another "witchy" black robe and 666
          earrings, finishes up HONEY's overly-theatrical
          makeup job.

                         HONEY

                         (TO RODNEY)
          Owwww! Please! I don't
          want to be blond!

                         RODNEY
          You're going right off the deep
          end of the Clairol color chart!
          RODNEY squirts on more dye.

                         HONEY
          It's burning my scalp!
          Ow! Ow! Ow!

                         RODNEY
          Beauty comes from agony! Everyone
          knows that!

                         RAVEN
          I haven't had this much fun since
          my last livestock mutilation...
          RAVEN lunges towards HONEY's eyebrows and painfully
          tweezes out a hair.

                         HONEY
          Oh God! That really hurt!

          Allistair Crowley said that.

                         RODNEY
          Let's wash it out!
          RODNEY yanks HONEY's head back as RAVEN pours
          scalding water over her head.

                         HONEY
          (Screams in pain,

                         SPUTTERING)

          Let me go! I won't tell
          anybody about your little movie.
          Suddenly CECIL enters dressed to the nines in another
          lunatic "movie director" outfit. He is accompanied by
          DINAH, who is even more severely dressed in thrift-shop
          couture, carrying a clip board and a stop watch.

          work area with piles of stolen clothes spread out in
          disarray. Insane fashion sketches of HONEY throwing
          bombs, firing guns, dressed in terrorist-inspired haute
          couture are tacked to the wall.
          FIDGET is vainly trying to rip off security device still
          attached to fake leopard military jacket. First he
          tries pulling it off with his teeth, then hits it with a
          hammer to no avail.

                         FIDGET

          I HATE THESE FUCKING THINGS!
          CECIL enters with HONEY as RODNEY and RAVEN follow,
          continuing torturing HONEY by blow-drying her hair
          with malfunctioning, smoking hair dryer and curling her
          eyelashes with rusty curlers.

                         CECIL
          Ah Fidget. Fidget, my little

          PAM is changing the film in her changing bag between her
          legs. She hears FIDGET and looks up excitedly.
          CHARDONNAY takes off her earphones and nods to LEWIS who
          is finishing up painting a van to look like a FEDEX
          delivery truck. All quickly exit.

          RODNEY, RAVEN, and FIDGET leer at HONEY who looks to
          CECIL in horror when she realizes there will be no
          privacy.

          DINAH leans over set wall from above and watches
          with open lesbian lust.

          LEWIS, CHARDONNAY, and PAM run to peepholes cut in
          "Wardrobe" walls and watch HONEY voyeuristically from
          the other side.

          61. INTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE - "WARDROBE"
          HONEY sees eyeballs staring through peepholes and
          looks to CECIL in sexual fear.

          allowed any form of sexual release.:.
          HONEY nervously starts to unzip her gown.
          SPROCKET HOLES let out an involuntary sexual moan.

                         HONEY
          (Muttering, furious)
          The Screen Actors Guild will
          hear about this and I mean it!
          HONEY lets gown fall to floor and steps out of it.
          She is wearing beautiful lingerie.

          pants.
          LEWIS, CHARDONNAY, and PAM watch from peepholes,
          breathing hard and moaning as HONEY slips into jacket.
          PETIE appears and jealously catches RODNEY trying to
          peek down the front of HONEY's jacket. RODNEY looks
          away guiltily.
          FIDGET whacks and "creates," lewdly "styling" HONEY's
          outfit. He then wheels full-length mirror to HONEY and
          signals to CECIL she is ready.
          HONEY sees her transformation into terrorist glamour
          girl for the first time.

                         HONEY
          Oh, God, I look terrible!
          (Breaks into sobs)
          CECIL and SPROCKET HOLES applaud triumphantly.

          HONEY twitches in agony and lets out a painful
          scream.

          LYLE shrugs his shoulders and happily pops the pill
          into his mouth.

                         CECIL
          .and ACTION!
          CECIL moves around stage, making cliche director's
          frame with his hands as PAM and CHARDONNAY rehearse
          camera and sound moves behind him.
          All the camera equipment has "UNIV OF MD" stenciled
          on it that has been scratched out half-heartedly.

          Hey, Cherish, it's 8:00. Am
          I supposed to get this show
          on the screen or what!?

                         CHERISH
          (In character, pissed)
          I didn't sell one ticket, Lyle.
          Nobody came!

                         LYLE

                         (FURIOUS)
          Pasolini's playing and we
          have an empty theater?!
          DINAH pushes HONEY on stage.

                         HONEY
          (Reading lines in a monotone)
          It's that fucking new multiplex
          that opened in the mall, isn't it?
          CECIL's face turns to stone as the rest of the
          SPROCKET HOLES watch, shocked at HONEY's wooden
          performance.

                         CHERISH
          I heard they were sold out
          last night, Mom!

                         (INCREDULOUS)
          Not for "THE FLINTSTONES"!? 
          CECIL starts banging his head painfully on cement
          wall to show his displeasure at HONEY's reading.

                         HONEY
          (Still in a monotone)
          Somebody's gotta pay for
          this insult!
          HONEY looks out and sees SPROCKET HOLES aping
          CECIL's self-destructive review of her reading;
          DINAH slaps her own face, LEWIS staples his own
          leg; RODNEY jams the sharp end of a rat-tail comb
          in his ear.
           This title will be replaced by a more recent
          critically panned big film hit we can get the

          good movie theater in America..
          PETIE fellates his own gun, RAVEN closes eyelash
          curler on her tongue.

                         HONEY

          Alright! Stop it! Please stop
          it! I'LL DO THE SCENE! FILM IT!

          JUST GET IT OVER WITH!
          CECIL immediately stops banging his head and
          SPROCKET HOLES return to normal.

                         CECIL

          PLACES!
          LYLE, CHERISH and HONEY return to start position as
          the rest of SPROCKET HOLES get ready to film.

          It's that fucking new multiplex

          CECIL's eyes light up in happiness at HONEY's
          performance.

                         CHERISH

          last night, Mom.

          CECIL silently mouths the dialogue along with HONEY.

                         HONEY
          From the empty movie seats of
          every good movie theater in
          America, we will rise to take
          back the screen!

          CUT and PRINT!
          CECIL and SPROCKET HOLES burst into applause.

                         CECIL
          That's more like it, Miss Whitlock!
          CHERISH gives HONEY a suddenly jealous look.

                         HONEY
          (Feeling her oats)
          To be frank, Cecil, I would
          never do this picture in my
          real film life. The whole
          message is stupid - ask theater
          owners in any country and they'll
          tell you. Hollywood makes the
          best films in the world and I'm
          proud to be part of that system.

                         CECIL
          (Suddenly the dictator again)
          Let's move on!

                         (SHOCKED)
          What? No coverage?

                         CECIL
          The first take is the only
          real truth...

                         HONEY
          But you can't cut the film
          with only a master!

                         CECIL
          There are no rules in outlaw
          cinema, Miss Whitlock, only
          edges. We believe technique
          to be nothing more than failed
          style. You see, I've had a vision...
          All the SPROCKET HOLES smile like film zombies to

          HONEY.

                         CECIL
          .and that vision is called
          "ultimate reality." The rest
          of our film is shot in real

          CECIL hurriedly flips through TIME Magazine until he
          finds the article he wants. RODNEY and RAVEN

          van with equipment and guns as LEWIS reads a copy of
          "Psychotronic" magazine.

          I see a fucking root already!
          He lunges to HONEY's scalp with hair dye applicator
          bottle.

          Owwww! Please, Cecil. I'm a
          much better actress in the studio...

                         CECIL
          That's not what TIME Magazine
          has to say.

          "Miss Whitlock seems a little
          ill at ease and past her prime

          RODNEY, RAVEN and FIDGET run to HONEY and touch her
          up and adjust costume whenever she's off camera.

          CECIL runs in front door followed by PAM and
          CHARDONNAY, carrying old-fashioned "sun-gun" lights,
          and still filming and recording the sound.
          CANDY COUNTER GIRLS look up in fear.

                         CECIL
          I am Cecil B. DeMented and you're
          in my movie! Look in the camera
          and ruin a take and you're both dead!
          CANDY COUNTER GIRLS get nervy, eager to be in any
          movie.

          CANDY COUNTER GIRLS scream in real fear.
          DINAH and LEWIS enter on exit side of front doors
          and guard the "set."
          LYLE and CHERISH enter in character with their guns
          drawn.
          LYLE grabs an over-sized cup from behind counter.

          CHERISH glares at a large marketing booth filled
          with items for sale in lobby.

                         CHERISH

          NOBODY NEEDS THIS GARBAGE!
          She overturns the booth and items crash to the
          floor.

          Horribly unfunny scene from "THE FLINTSTONES" is
          seen on screen.
          Packed AUDIENCE howls in laughter.
          Doors to lobby fly open and CECIL and his CAST and CREW
          come running in, tying handkerchiefs around their noses
          and mouths and filming the action. CECIL fires his gun
          in air. AUDIENCE turns around in confusion.

                         CECIL
          (Hissing to HONEY)

          THIS FILM STINKS AND YOU KNOW IT!
          LYLE, CHERISH and HONEY lob stink bombs into AUDIENCE.
          AUDIENCE screams in panic as stink bombs go off, and
          tries to run to exits, holding their noses and
          gagging as PAM and CHARDONNAY record their every
          move.
          CECIL smiles in directorial lunacy as one TICKET
          BUYER vomits right in front of PAM's camera.

                         CECIL

          CUT! PRINT!
          (To HONEY and SPROCKET HOLES)

          WRAP IT UP AND RUN!
          CECIL, his "cast and crew" take off, chanting their
          terrorist yell.

          FADE OUT.

          "NO BUDGET." ("When we say action, we mean action,

          Wild "Dailies" party is in progress. LYLE is
          smoking crack and showing developed footage from
          that day's shoot on the wall of the warehouse as he
          dances lewdly with himself in place.
          LEWIS watches the "dailies" as he DJ's from turntables in
          booth while CHARDONNAY sexily raps the outlaw-film
          call-to-arms we hear on the soundtrack.
          PETIE and RODNEY torridly go-go dance on separate
          tables as PAM and DINAH writhe sexily to the beat on
          the dance floor.
          CECIL and CHERISH watch the gritty film rushes atop
          CECIL's bizarrely decored crane that doubles as their
          love nest. CECIL is frantically trying to write his
          script but CHERISH is pawing him, turned on by seeing
          herself on film.

                         CHERISH
          Come on, Cecil, I want a little
          "action" of my own!

                         CECIL
          (Gently pushing her away)
          I'm trying to write, Cherish!
          HONEY, looking more relaxed, with only one leg cuffed to
          director's chair, watches herself on film in the arty,
          grainy, but very striking footage.
          RAVEN does a "devil dance" with herself and
          ritualistically drinks from a skull head.

                         RAVEN

                         (TO HONEY)

          It's a Satan thing!

          You're really good in our movie!
          HONEY beams at compliment, catches herself, and smiles
          weakly back at RAVEN as FIDGET approaches with a martini
          on a tray for HONEY.

          Oh, craft service. Thank you,
          Fidget, but I never
          drink when I'm working but
          you're very kind. Do your parents
          know where you are tonight?

                         FIDGET
          They're probably mad...

                         HONEY

          high.

          Hey Honey, want some crack?

                         HONEY
          I most certainly do NOT, Lyle.
          I can't believe you'd be a drug
          addict in the 90's - it's so retro.

                         LYLE
          Before I was a drug addict, I had
          so many different problems, Honey.
          Now I just have one - drugs. It
          gave my life a real focus.
          Cut to CECIL on crane with CHERISH as they hornily
          watch CHERISH on film.

          Why not?!

                         (PROUDLY)

          financial success!
          (Wide-eyed, to all)

          SPROCKET HOLES, BE STRONG!

          AND JOIN ME IN PRAYER!
          LEWIS and CHARDONNAY give up quickly and join the
          other SPROCKET HOLES as they fall to their knees in
          cult worship.
          HONEY signals to FIDGET she's changed her mind -
          she'll have the martini after all.

                         CECIL
          Oh, Andy Warhol, we worship
          you from the new cinema
          underground...

                         ALL
          Oh, Andy Warhol, we worship
          you from the new cinema
          underground...
          HONEY guzzles down the martini.
          CHERISH prays the hardest, still sexually aroused.

                         CECIL
          .help us to use our sexual
          frustrations as you did for
          the future of outlaw film!

          SAY IT SPROCKET HOLES!
          HONEY watches, a little tipsy.

                         ALL

          CELIBATE FOR CELLULOID!

                         CECIL

          SAY IT AGAIN LOUDER!
          HONEY absentmindedly joins in as she stares at
          herself in rushes looking quite stellar as,CHERISH
          eyes her jealously.

                         ALL

          CELIBATE FOR CELLULOID.

                         CECIL

          LIGHTS OUT!

          75. Cut to INTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. 75.
          SPROCKET HOLES are passed out all over loft,
          surrounded by rotting junk food, empty liquor
          bottles and last night's party debris.
          CECIL and CHERISH lie asleep twisted and entwined in
          the sheets, tortured by their erotic dreams.
          Suddenly, one of CECIL's bloodshot eyes open and
          he lurches for the microphone.

                         CECIL
          (In a booming voice to
          all the SPROCKET HOLES

                         BELOW HIM)
          Hey kids! Wake up! Let's make
          a mother-fucking movie!
          He hits hideously loud alarm button.
          SPROCKET HOLES leap to their feet and stagger into
          film production.

          76. INTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. HONEY'S DRESSING ROOM. 76.
          Before she can barely open her eyes, HONEY sees
          RODNEY and RAVEN rushing towards her, their
          instruments of beauty torture ready.

                         RODNEY
          (Glaring at HONEY's hair)
          I see that fucking brown color...

                         HONEY
          Please Rodney, those aren't roots
          - they're scabs on my scalp from
          the dye and they're raw!
          RODNEY sadistically squirts her roots with dye as
          HONEY lets out a cry of agony.

                         RAVEN

                         (SMILING)
          Just close your eyes and think
          of the films of George Cukor.
          RAVEN tweezes HONEY'S eyebrows painfully as RODNEY
          continues to torture her hair.

                         HONEY
          OWWWW!! Please... please...
          (Trying a new tactic)
          Raven, you're a pretty girl,
          you could escape this madness...

                         RAVEN
          Escape to what, Honey?

                         (PROUDLY)
          My father is a Zo-Zo, the
          three-headed guard dog at the
          gate of hell!

                         HONEY
          Well ...I'm sorry to hear that...

                         RAVEN
          And one day I'm gonna commit
          revolutionary suicide for celluloid...

                         HONEY

                         (REALLY SCARED)
          Don't say that, Raven! Tell her,
          Rodney - no movie is worth dying for!
          RODNEY blasts HONEY's hair with his fiery
          malfunctioning drier as she cries out in pain.

                         HONEY
          OWWWW! Rodney, why do you want
          to hurt me? Gay men are supposed
          to be gentle...

                         RODNEY
          (Begins teasing HONEY's hair)
          That's just it, Honey! I'm not
          gay. I'm straight and I fucking
          hate it! Petie loves me but I
          can't love him back! I've tried!
          I kiss him and all I feel is beard.

          I CAN'T TAKE THAT CERTAIN THICKNESS

          IN HIS PANTS!

                         (SOBBING)
          I'm so ashamed of my heterosexuality!

                         RAVEN

                         (COMFORTING HIM)
          Oh, it's alright, Rodney.

                         RODNEY
          (Suddenly snapping back

                         INTO MEANNESS)

          That's why some days I gotta
          hurt people.
          (Starts brushing out HONEY's
          teased hair brutally)

                         HONEY

          OWWWWW!

                         RAVEN
          It's not Honey's fault.

                         RODNEY
          Make them pay for me thinking
          about pussy!
          RODNEY rips out a clump of HONEY'S teased hair with
          brush.

                         HONEY
          Oh God, stop...

                         RAVEN

                         (TO RODNEY)
          No one chooses to be
          heterosexual. Honey knows
          that.

                         RODNEY
          (In a rage)

          I'M STRAIGHT! AND I HATE!

          SO JUST GET USED TO IT,

          HONEY WHITLOCK!
          He blasts the blow drier on finished hairdo and
          flames singe her neck.

                         HONEY

          AHHHHHHHHH!
          CECIL enters, now dressed in an even more elaborate
          Cecil B. DeMille-inspired movie director outfit.
          PETIE, acting as bodyguard, leers at RODNEY who lets
          out one final sob of frustration as DINAH, changed
          into another alarming retro fashion number wheels in
          her portable TV monitor and VCR.

                         CECIL
          Good morning, Miss Whitlock.

                         HONEY

                         (SOBBING)
          Cecil, I want to go back to
          Hollywood!

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         - 55 -

                         CECIL
          Whatever for? Your old career
          is over. . .but your comeback
          has just begun...
          CECIL nods to DINAH to start tape and we see a
          TEENAGE BOY on news in front of vandalized Timonium
          theater.

                         TEENAGE BOY
          .I was in the audience when
          they attacked and I'll tell
          you. . .Honey Whitlock was awesome!
          HONEY looks in confusion to CECIL who smiles proudly
          back. Tape jumps to a different news show showing
          TEEN GIRL, wearing a handmade "CECIL RULES" T-shirt.
          She stands out front of the popular local art house,
          The Charles Theater.

                         TEEN GIRL
          I think Honey Whitlock is right
          - most films suck and it's time
          somebody did something about it...
          HONEY catches herself half smiling at the favorable
          mention.
          Tape cuts to TIMONIUM THEATER MANAGER, his head now
          bandaged.

                         THEATER MANAGER
          .Nobody forced her to be in
          that movie, I could see that,
          but she was damn good! Scarier
          than hell, if you ask me! She
          looked different from her other
          films, too...I don't know...
          younger.
          HONEY's face lights up but CECIL quickly brings her
          down to earth.

                         CECIL
          There are still some people
          who don't understand our work...
          DINAH zaps on TV and we see MIDDLE-AGED MAN in suit
          behind podium at press conference. Subtitle
          identifies him as "MARYLAND FILM COMMISSIONER."

                         DINAH

          Cecil B. DeMented, the Maryland
          Film Commission refuses to be
          intimidated by your pathetic
          gang of cinematic misfits...
          SPROCKET HOLES let out a howl of disgust as HONEY
          pales.
          77. Cut to "PRIDE OF BALTIMORE," a tall tourist 77.
          attraction docked in the Inner Harbor, the popular
          retail area on the water near the Convention Center.
          The "Hollywood Oyster Bash" is in progress as FILM
          COMMISSIONER continues his speech.

                         FILM COMMISSIONER
          .That's why we're here today
          on "The Pride of Baltimore" to
          celebrate location shooting in
          Maryland with many of the brave
          production and studio heads from
          out of state who also say NO to
          cinema terrorism.

          APPLAUSE.

          78. INTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. 78.
          HONEY gulps in a new found fear as she sees the rage
          building on CECIL'S twisted face.

                         CECIL

          I. .HAVE...A...VISION...
          SPROCKET HOLES gather around him in militant
          enthusiasm.

                         CECIL
          .And this time somebody
          might have to die!
          79. Wipe to EXTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. 79.
          Doors swing open and CECIL's speeding van, driven
          by PETIE and now hurriedly painted over to resemble
          UTZ Potato Chips delivery vehicle, flies out and
          careens around the corner.

          CECIL is hastily re-writing his script in long-hand
          and as soon as he finishes a page, DINAH snatches it
          and passes it out to HONEY, LYLE and CHERISH who are
          now dressed in FIDGET'S newest terrorist costumes.
          The rest of the SPROCKET HOLES, dressed in caterer's
          outfits, huddle in the back of the van preparing the
          film equipment. RODNEY and RAVEN, as always, touch
          up HONEY.

          of script, to HONEY, LYLE

          OK, in this scene you guys are
          the avenging angels of

          safe for their kind of movies!

          You think just 'cause you
          made "real" movies that you're
          better than me, don't you?

          I guess you are. "Jingle

          try some "Special K"?

                         HONEY
          I'm working, Lyle!

          83. INTERIOR ABANDONED PIER BUILDING. 83.
          CECIL, HONEY, LYLE and CHERISH rush in.

                         CHERISH
          "Human pile," screamed my
          grandfather as they all jumped
          on! Do you know what a human
          pile is?!
          CECIL leads them up rickety steps to second floor
          trap door.

                         LYLE

          I DO!

                         HONEY

          free as possible!
          CHARDONNAY hits WAITRESS over head with boom pole
          and grabs another tray of oysters.

                         FILM COMMISSIONER
          That's why we call Baltimore
          "The Hollywood of the East"!

          CECIL, HONEY, CHERISH and LYLE climb out of trap

          Oh, really! Are you sure this stuff
          really happened?

          (In a sudden rage)

          YES IT REALLY HAPPENED! "OH

          Shut up, Cherish. I've told you.

          THAT'S ALL OVER WITH! SAVE YOUR

          RAGE AND USE IT IN THE CINEMA!
          CHERISH suddenly quiets down in fear.

          A what?

                         CECIL
          A simple little stunt.

                         HONEY
          It doesn't say anything
          about a stunt in your rewrite.

                         CECIL

                         (TO HONEY)
          See Pam?
          HONEY looks down to PAM, and sees PAM putting
          gaffer's tape mark on deck of ship.

          86. "PRIDE OF BALTIMORE" DECK. 86.
          PAM, wearing earphones, looks up at CECIL and HONEY
          in window and nods gravely.
          Another CATERER looks quizzically at PAM, not
          recognizing her. He then sees DINAH shucking
          oysters and realizes something is wrong. He spots a
          mobile phone on table.

          That's your mark. When you
          hear "Action," jump through
          the window, and land facing
          Pam's camera.

          But Cecil, surely you realize
          I could be injured...

          Prove yourself, Honey.
          HONEY spots a marine police boat quickly darting
          behind "Pride of Baltimore," filled with MARINE

          POLICE.

          (Realizing this could be
          her only chance)
          Alright, Cecil. I'm a professional...
          Roll the camera.

          CHERISH and LYLE rush to scurry back down steps.
          CECIL hands HONEY a grenade and a gun.

                         CECIL
          Don't worry, they're just props.
          After your first line, throw the
          grenade at the Film Commission.
          Nobody will get hurt.

                         HONEY
          But there are bullets in

          HONEY runs and jumps through window.

          93. DECK OF "PRIDE OF BALTIMORE." 93.
          HONEY comes crashing down in a hail of broken glass
          and lands directly on her mark holding her grenade.
          PARTY GUESTS scream in panic and try to escape but
          PETIE, DINAH, FIDGET and LEWIS block every exit with
          drawn guns.
          HONEY, bleeding from tiny cuts looks up to CECIL'S
          directorial glare and realizes she is supposed to
          act.

          No...please...I was only
          following studio orders.
          HONEY throws what she thinks is her "prop" grenade.
          The FILM COMMISSIONER dives out of the way and it
          explodes.
          HONEY, horrified that the "effect" was real looks up
          to CECIL but he has vanished.
          Suddenly CECIL enters the ship "directing" through
          megaphone.

          CHERISH, firing her gun wildly, runs to LYLE and
          manages to pull him "off set" as HONEY freezes in
          terror deciding between her director or the POLICE.
          CHARDONNAY fires her gun and accidentally blasts her

          PRODUCER C clutches his stomach and doubles over.
          HONEY covers her mouth in real horror.
          Instantly PRODUCER C recovers, realizing the bullet
          was a blank.

          THAT'S A CUT!
          CECIL is shot in the left shoulder by POLICE.
          HONEY kisses RAVEN goodbye and makes a break for it
          and runs towards MARINE POLICE.

          DON'T SHOOT! I'm Honey Whitlock
          and I've been kidnapped!
          HONEY is shocked when the POLICE tackle her and
          place her under arrest.
          DINAH grabs FILM COMMISSIONER and uses him as a
          human shield as she fires away, hitting several
          cops.

                         FILM COMMISSIONER

          NO! NO! WE'LL GO TO SUNDANCE

          TOGETHER, I PROMISE!
          CECIL, clutching his shoulder wound, looks up in
          shock to see HONEY being dragged off ship in
          handcuffs as POLICE read her her Miranda rights.

                         HONEY

          As HONEY is roughly shoved in back seat of cop car,
          SPROCKET HOLES open fire and blast out back window.

          movie!
          FIDGET starts whacking nervously.

                         CECIL
          (Right in FIDGET's face)
          And to top it off...they talk
          out loud in the theater once
          the feature has begun!
          SPROCKET HOLES grimace in horror.
          Even HONEY shakes her head in disgust as she pours
          martini into glass.

                         HONEY
          That really is unforgivable,
          Fidget!

          FIDGET looks around at the brainwashed faces of his
          disgusted, judgmental cult and crumbles.
          HONEY greedily gulps down her martini.

                         FIDGET

          OK! OK! MY PARENTS ARE THE

          ENEMY OF FILM! DO IT!
          PETIE brands FIDGET as CECIL smiles victoriously.
          HONEY, slightly tipsy, joins the SPROCKET HOLES in
          singing the refrain.

          DEMENTED FOREVER!
          CECIL turns to HONEY as PETIE brandishes the red hot
          iron.

                         CECIL
          And you...Honey?

                         HONEY
          No, Cecil...
          CECIL nods to DINAH who plays the tape.
          HONEY sees her ex-husband, a handsome movie star on
          screen with JAY LENO on "The Tonight Show."

                         EX-HUSBAND
          Well, I was married to her for
          seven years so I know just
          how nuts Honey Whitlock is...
          JAY LENO and STUDIO AUDIENCE howls in laughter.
          HONEY stares at TV, betrayed as RAVEN gently puts her
          t arms around her in comfort.

                         RAVEN

          CECIL fires his gun and kills TEAMSTER B.

          PAM pans the camera back to TEAMSTER C and shoots her
          gun and kills him.
          CHERISH runs to crane and hops on with CECIL and shoots
          at TEAMSTERS D & E who rush in.
          DINAH sees that CECIL has been hit and a look of fury
          sweeps over her face.
          CECIL fires gun at TEAMSTERS F, G & H as they flood the
          set.
          FIDGET fires his gun at TEAMSTER F with one hand and
          plays pocket pool with the other hand. He is shot in
          pocket pool hand by TEAMSTER G and looks down, stunned
          at his injury.
          PETIE maneuvers the crane from below with amazing skill
          to dodge the bullets as CECIL and CHERISH fire back at
          TEAMSTERS G & H, and PAM continues to film.
          PAM is shot in stomach by TEAMSTER G.
          LEWIS staple guns TEAMSTER F right in the neck with
          multiple staples.
          CHARDONNAY hurls an expensive microphone at TEAMSTER H
          just as he is about to shoot her and then continues

          Suddenly TEAMSTER D jumps from trap door in set floor
          with gun aimed at HONEY.
          CHERISH fires her gun in the nick of time and kills
          TEAMSTER D and saves HONEY's life.
          HONEY locks eyes with CHERISH in a newfound thespian
          bond.
          HONEY, FIDGET and RAVEN crawl off set as bullets fly
          over their heads.
          CECIL, PAM and CHERISH are cornered by TEAMSTERS E, G &
          H who advance on crane with drawn guns.
          PETIE throws his hands in the air.
          CECIL fires but he is out of ammunition.
          DINAH frantically reloads her weapons.
          CHERISH fires but then she too is out of ammunition.
          PAM continues to film, bleeding badly from her wound.
          DINAH suddenly runs in front of CECIL in a kamikaze
          action and opens fire killing TEAMSTERS E, G & H.
          CECIL grabs HONEY and all SPROCKET HOLES manage to
          escape set before TEAMSTER F, badly injured with staples
          in neck, staggers to his feet and mows down DINAH in a
          hail of bullets.
          CECIL's eyes light up in horror at seeing DINAH's
          corpse.

          CHERISH races ahead and turns the corner just as

          CECIL leaps to his feet in front of SPROCKET HOLES to
          prevent last minute orgasm.

                         CECIL

          CELIBATE FOR CELLULOID!
          SPROCKET HOLES stop panting and moan in sexual
          frustration.
          GROUPIE rushes over to HONEY's side.
          CECIL glares at him in a macho power struggle.
          GROUPIE defiantly puts him arm around HONEY as she begs
          CECIL with her eyes for approval.
          GROUPIE smiles and pulls up shirt sleeve to reveal to
          CECIL the "Cecil B. DeMented" tattoo on his arm.
          CECIL suddenly basks in cult worship.
          HONEY beams in happiness.
          CECIL and GROUPIE give each other the power handshake.

          races down steps to first floor of her house and sees
          HIT MAN #2 briefly staring through front door. Her
          CHARACTER runs to kitchen in fear and drops cat to get
          butcher knife out of kitchen drawer.

          propped up on chair nearby. A knock is heard at door.

          MANAGER looks to his shotgun.
          CECIL steps forward with CHERISH and pulls his empty

           cat-door and grabs her leg. HIT MAN #1 knocks knife
          from her hand. HIT MAN #2 grabs her ass with other
          hand. HONEY'S CHARACTER lets out a scream of horror.

          ENEMIES with fists, bottles, anything they can grab as
          FAMILIES scream in terror, trapped.

          BALTIMORE CITY QUICK RESPONSE TEAM pulls up in
          reconnaissance vehicles. Uniformed SWAT TEAMS jump out
          carrying high-powered semi-automatic rifles.

          CECIL continues on intercom system surrounded by
          CHERISH, HONEY, GROUPIE, and rest of SPROCKET HOLES.

                         CECIL
          They want to detain some
          of you and put you in focus
          groups!

          SWAT TEAM LEADER looks in confusion at growing number of
          CECIL FANS yelling out "No!" and joining in the
          disturbance.

                         CECIL

          WACO! WACO!
          CECIL angrily shoves GROUPIE out office door as even
          HONEY sighs in embarrassment at GROUPIE's behavior.

          154. DRIVE-IN ENTRANCE. 154.
          FIDGET'S MOM and DAD speed into drive-in with nervous
          PSYCHIATRIST in back seat of family car. FIDGET'S DAD
          speaks into microphone of sound system that blasts out
          over hastily-rigged speaker on roof of car.

                         FIDGET'S DAD

          Fidget, it's Mommy. We know
          you've seen too many R-rated
          movies and we're here to help...
          Suddenly mini-cams from other local news teams
          speed into drive-in behind them.

          155. INTERIOR DRIVE-IN. 155.
          SWAT TEAMS flood through rows of cars in the drive-in,
          weapons drawn, waiting for the word to attack.

          CECIL'S MOM and DAD, dressed in SWAT clothes surrounded

          Sinclair, it's your father...

          CECIL looks up in fury at hearing his real name, as
          HONEY and SPROCKET HOLES hover around him.

          PETIE and FIDGET struggle to carry CECIL on "set" in a
          makeshift stretcher as RAVEN applies makeup to his
          wounds. CHERISH is at his side, caressing him lovingly.

          CECIL'S FANS go nuts rushing towards CECIL below

          makeshift "mosh pit" underneath the set to fight one
          another.

          CECIL'S FANS go ballistic as HONEY smiles regally to
          them. GROUPIE gazes up at her in obsessive star
          worship as ENEMIES boo.

          Honey, I've had a final vision.
          Would you set your hair on fire
          for our movie...?

          roll back in her head, flash cut with "Directed by Andy
          Warhol" credit.

          Peckinpah, Spike Lee, David Lynch, Fassbinder.

          HONEY looks to GROUPIE in a sea of cheering FANS. He is
          finishing up carving HONEY's initials "H.W." in his
          forehead with a pop-top beer can tab.

                         CECIL

          You will be the eternal flame of
          cinema insanity.
          HONEY's eyes glaze over in cult madness.

          HONEY tips her head out of PAM's frame and CHERISH sets
          HONEY's hair on fire with one quick touch of the torch.
          HONEY's hair goes up in flames as she gives the
          performance of a lifetime as LEWIS pushes PAM on the
          wheelchair and they film their most technically
          ambitious shot.

                         HONEY

          FANS go wild, screaming their approval.
          GROUPIE vainly tries to light his own hair on fire with
          a lighter but it doesn't really work.
          CECIL'S ENEMIES stare at HONEY's hair ablaze in shock.
          SWAT TEAMS' mouths fall open in stunned amazement.
          FIDGET'S PARENTS and PSYCHIATRIST watch in horror.
          CECIL watches from stretcher in pride and amazement and
          motions for PETIE and FIDGET to put him down.

          FIDGET quickly steps forward and extinguishes flames
          from HONEY's hair with fire extinguisher.

          HONEY, charred and still sizzling, smiles weakly and
          feels her almost bald head.
          SWAT TEAM CAPTAIN takes aim with rest of SHARPSHOOTERS.
          Instantly PAM is shot dead by SWAT TEAM SHARPSHOOTER and
          her camera falls to ground.

          B in audience, PETIE eyes a TOM OF FINLAND TYPE who
          nervously cruises back, and FIDGET plunges both hands
          deep in the fly of his pants. Their partners struggle
          to climb up on roof and everybody begins to make love.
          HONEY looks hornily to GROUPIE below but he is being
          beaten up by JOCKS A, B & C as he desperately tries to
          struggle up to her. HONEY sighs in sexual frustration.
          CHERISH runs to dying CECIL, unzips his pants and mounts
          him.
          COPS and SWAT TEAMS freeze in utter horror at the sudden
          sexual activity.
          FIDGET'S PARENTS lower their eyes at seeing FIDGET in
          deliriously happy orgasm alone as PSYCHIATRIST eagerly
          takes notes.
          NEWS TEAMS beat each other up to get better camera
          positions.
          SPROCKET HOLES reach orgasm together as the FANS cheer
          through the tear gas.

          Just after CHERISH and CECIL reach orgasm, CHERISH is
          shot dead in the forehead by SWAT TEAM A who leaps to
          roof of manager's office from helicopter.
          HONEY sees CHERISH's death, grabs PAM's camera from the
          ground and hurls it at SWAT TEAM MEMBER A and hits him
          in the head. He staggers backwards, drops his gun, and
          falls off roof where FANS refuse to catch him and he
          lands with a thud.
          SPROCKET HOLES leap up from lovemaking to escape but are
          shot again and again, badly outnumbered.
          FIDGET'S MOM and DAD grab PSYCHIATRIST and run for their
          lives, crying in despair.
          FIDGET sees his PARENTS in distance and jumps off roof
          to follow and is safely caught by CECIL FANS.
          LEWIS looks into cheering FANS' faces and suddenly jumps
          from concession stand roof with changing bag into mob of
          FANS and removes exposed film from PAM's camera.
          SWAT TEAM MEMBER B jumps from high roof of manager's
          office to concession stand roof pointing an AR15 at

          HONEY.

                         SWAT B
          I seen what you did, you
          Hollywood bitch!
          HONEY looks through the tear gas below to see GROUPIE
          suddenly battling himself free from JOCKS A, B & C. He
          bravely beckons HONEY to jump.
          CECIL disengages CHERISH's dead body up and off of him
          and seeing HONEY in danger crawls painfully to Pam's
          wheelchair dolly.

                         (TO HONEY)
          You're under arrest, Honey
          Whitlock!
          HONEY leaps from roof into mob of FANS and lands safely
          in GROUPIE's arms. They immediately begin to kiss in
          wild abandon.
          SWAT B shoots GROUPIE from atop roof and kills him.
          HONEY cries out at his death and panics as SWAT TEAM
          MEMBERS move in on her pointing high-powered rifles.
          FANS and ENEMIES scatter, abandoning her.

          CECIL lunges for dropped gun of SWAT TEAM A and shoots
          SWAT B dead, struggles aboard dolly and nods to FIDGET
          to douse him with gas.

          HONEY looks for help but she is suddenly all alone.
          CECIL pushes himself forward on wheelchair dolly,
          gaining speed and begins laughing maniacally.
          FIDGET flicks lit match on CECIL as he rolls by and
          CECIL ignites like a Buddhist monk.

                         CECIL
          (Flying through the air off
          roof in wheelchair, towards
          SWAT TEAM below)

          I H-A-A-A-V-V-V-V-E-E-E-E A

          V-I-I-I-S-S-S-I-O-N!
          CECIL smashes into SWAT TEAM and they go up in flames,
          saving HONEY in the nick of time.

          HONEY sees BALTIMORE CITY POLICE, MARYLAND STATE
          TROOPERS, more SWAT TEAMS, local and national PRESS
          TEAMS, all running towards her with guns and camera
          equipment. She turns away, pulls out compact and sees
          her smeared makeup. She looks for RAVEN to touch her up
          and spots her being hustled away by SATANIST-TYPE FANS
          outside concession stand moments before the plate glass
          windows are shattered by police gunfire.

          PETIE is jumped and arrested by special SWAT TEAM
          wearing rubber gloves and surgical masks. PETIE laughs
          and moans in S & M pleasure as he tries to grope an
          especially macho MEMBER OF SWAT TEAM.

          HONEY turns back to mob in front of her and gives them a
          demented movie star grin.

          167. BENGIES DRIVE-IN MARQUEE. Out front of theater. 167.
          FIDGET struggles to climb up marquee to search for his
          PARENTS but he doesn't see them. He angrily starts
          throwing down letters as weapons at fleeing cars,
          smashing the window of bleeding, injured JOCKS A, B &
          C's car.

          168. INTERIOR DRIVE-IN. 168.
          LEWIS and CHARDONNAY, carrying film cans, climb into the
          trunk of CECIL FAN A's car and escape with the final
          footage.
          169. Cut back to BENGIES DRIVE-IN MARQUEE. 169.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          - ill -
          With only a few letters left on the marquee, FIDGET
          re-arranges them to read T-H-E- E-N-O before a SWAT TEA,
          bullet tears into him. FIDGET falls and lands on the
          hood of his PARENTS' car as they exit the drive-in.

                         FIDGET
          (Injured badly, but alive)
          Hi Mom, hi Dad.
          FIDGET'S MOM and DAD'S eyes light up in parental love.

          170. INTERIOR BENGIES DRIVE-IN. 170.

          HONEY, bald, bleeding, and burned, sees RAVEN and their
          eyes lock in friendship as RAVEN escapes into SATANIST
          FAN's car. RAVEN happily gives HONEY the extended index
          and little finger satanic sign and then turns it into a
          thumbs-up gesture of the future.

          HONEY blows RAVEN a kiss and then looks back at the
          CROWD in confusion and begins her long mad walk to
          paddy-wagon through FANS, ENEMIES, MOVIE AGENTS,
          LAWYERS, NEWS TEAMS, and dumbfounded LAW ENFORCEMENT
          OFFICERS who all want something from HONEY. As the
          soundtrack swells triumphantly over the din of jeers,
          applause, career advice, legal strategies and requests
          for autographs and interviews, HONEY begins to smile in
          full movie star insanity and waves and blows kisses to
          the CROWD as if she just won the Oscar.

          CREDIT ROLL.
