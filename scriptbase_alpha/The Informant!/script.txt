          Moving across the screen from right to left. We hear a happy

          You know that orange juice you have
          every morning? You know what's in
          that?

          That's right. C2rn.
          A HUGE COMBINE enters frame and turns down a row. The camera
          follows it. We are in the middle of a massive corn field in
          SOUTHERN ILLINOIS. The wind creates swells in the corn like
          a great green and gold sea. The farm equipment accelerates as
          does Whitacre...

          starch in my beer, even corn oil in
          the paint we're putting on the
          barn...
          Corn flies through the air and into the collecting bin.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          .Bacon and eggs is really just
          corn and corn when you think about
          what they feed the chickens and the
          pigs. And when you're good and
          help with the trash, you know what
          makes the big green bags
          biodegradeable?
          We reach the end of a row. The combine turns to harvest

          WHITACRE, 33, drives his young son ALEXANDER, 6, to school.
          Whitacre is as happy as God makes creatures. Alexander sips
          his half-pint carton of ORANGE JUICE.

                         WHITACRE
          Do you?
          Alexander hazards a guess.

                         ALEXANDER
          Uh-huh. Corn.

                         WHITACRE
          Corn starch. But, Daddy's company
          didn't come up with that one--
          DuPont did...
          Whitacre tussles his hair. They drive by a GAS STATION in the
          middle of the cornfields. He continues his ode to corn in
          his head...

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          Ethanol is made of corn; that's
          ADM. Car corn. Like gasoline. But
          they also use it for scotch, gin
          and vodka ...Corn and tonic... corn
          gimlet...corn on the rocks.

          The car accelerates to pass a tanker truck with ADM:

          warped in the reflection...

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          Porsche or Porsh-a. I've heard it
          both ways. Three years in Germany,
          I should know that. What's the
          German word for corn? The word I
          really like saying is
          "kugelschreiber." That's "pen"--
          all those syllables just for "pen."

          A PEN SIGNS A LEDGER
          Whitacre signs in with the security gate at ARCHER DANIELS
          MIDLAND headquarters in Decatur. A sprawling industrial
          facility that makes most of what America eats. Grain
          elevators, cooling towers, processing plants, loading docks
          and a six story concrete bunker of an office building. He
          parks his car in a monogrammed space.

          3 INTERIOR ADM HEADQUARTERS-CONTINUOUS 3
          Whitacre walks across the open trading floor where soy and
          corn futures from around the world are displayed on a tote
          board and into his glass walled office.
          He has a kind word for everyone. Smile flashing like a
          casino sign. He sees his pal Kirk Schmidt from accounting...

                         WHITACRE
          Hey there, howdy. Hey, Kirk, we
          got to get out and hit some
          balls ...Morning...Guten Tag...
          Whitacre scans the room full of busy co-workers. His
          secretary, LIZ TAYLOR, 35, wears earrings that are EARS OF
          CORN made of gold.

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          What do they pay Kirk. . .What does a
          guy like that get...100K...I bet he
          gets a 100. He's just going to sit
          behind that desk and ride it into
          the future...

                         LIZ TAYLOR
          Morning Mark...They have lysine
          results...
          She hands him a folder. He opens it and scans the data. He
          nods.

          4 INTERIOR LYSINE PLANT- A FEW MINUTES LATER 4
          Whitacre walks among the giant fermenters-- he's joined by a
          DISCOURAGED FOREMAN. They check various gauges and dials
          showing proof of failure.

                         DISCOURAGED FOREMAN
          We adjusted the dextrose again, but
          the vrus keeps showing
          up-Thought we had it surrounded
          this time. We're starting a new set
          of cultures...

                         WHITACRE
          We'll Vet it. We just gotta stay
          after it. The things eat sugar and
          that's what we're giving them-- a
          warm place filled with sugar.
          They walk into a clean room full of flasks mechanically
          shaken like paint cans-- it's too loud to speak. Each flask
          is connected to a feed tube-- the cultures are administered
          to by a HALF DOZEN BIO TECH WORKERS. Whitacre watches. He
          focuses on one worker-- she's ASIAN. She adds some nutrients
          to the feed line.

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          A positive mental attitude is a
          real important thing. They've done
          studies where heart patients who
          have people praying for them
          actually do better than ones who
          don't. There's science for you.
          The cheerleaders might make a
          difference in the game after
          all...How do you know what the
          electrical energy of a thought
          actually does when it's out there
          in the world? It's gotta go
          somewhere...so you might as well
          smile. Takes less muscles than
          frowning...
          Whitacre closes the door on the very loud room.

          5 INTERIOR ADM BOARDROOM- LATER 5
           Whitacre sits with MICK ANDREAS, Vice Chairman, 45, and TERRY
          WILSON, 55, President. An overhead projector displays the
           desultory performance of Whitacre's division.

                         ANDREAS (CONT'D)
          We're not gonna get anywhere near
          that. We got 150 million dollars in
          costs over there guys. I can see
          the fucking thing from my swimming
          pool and it makes me want to drown
          myself every morning.

                         WILSON
          Did the Japanese have these kind of
          problems with lysine?

                         AN DREAS

                         (TO WHITACRE)
          I don't give a shit about the
          Japanese. You just gotta get the
          Goddamn lysine bugs to eat the
          dextrose and shit us out some
          money.

                         WHITACRE
          We're still having problems with
          this virus.

                         ANDREAS
          I don't want to hear about the damn
          virus anymore. Terry, what are we
          losing a month?

                         WILSON
          We're off like seven million per.

                         ANDREAS
          That's not gonna fly much longer.
          You want to go in there next
          quarter and tell the board that
          we're sucking hind tit on
          this...cuz' I sure don't.
          He gives Whitacre a cold, hard, we're--done-fucking-around-
          glare.

                         ANDREAS
          Fix the Goddamn plant, or we're
          gonna shut it down.
          The last light goes out.

          Ginger and Mark have known each other since High School. She
          was Homecoming Queen then. Either would be hard pressed to
          envision a life without each other.

                         GINGER
          You're not hungry, Corky.
          Whitacre is distracted. Ginger cuts up Alexander's food.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          The pilgrims loved the corn-- they
          came for the religious freedom but
          they stayed for the corn-- but its
          missing three of your eight
          essential amino acids-- especially
          lysine. That's why the Indians ate
          it with beans or lime. You feed a
          chicken corn and it gets sick. Yo
          feed it corn and lysine and it goes
          from egg to supermarket fryer in
          six months instead of eight...
          Whitacre gazes over at a plate of fried chicken, and then at
          his wife. She has gotten dressed up for dinner. She looks
          pretty.

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          Breasts and thighs in six months...

                         WHITACRE
          You look great.

                         GINGER
          They got the first wall of the
          stables up today. You see that?

          They're doing this thing in
          hydroponics where they're feeding
          lysine to jumbo shrimp... Imagine
          you're a sh rimp and one day some
          corn goes floating by, what do you
          think about that?
          Alexander smiles.

                         GINGER
          I don't know what I'd think about
          that.

          I would rather take a lot of pain
          killers in a. hotel room than jump
          off a bridge...Or use a gun. A gun

          definitely... Lie down in a great

          The Regent? What a bed! If you
          think about it, that doesn't mean

          His secretary, LIZ TAYLOR, buzzes him on the intercom.

          Sixth grade. Marty Blocker used to
          sell us Charm's Blow Pops for three
          cents, which was a great deal cuz
          at Valley Drug they cost a nickel.
          He said his Dad worked for Charms--
          said he invented the Blow Pop and
          got a special deal-- like a life
          time supply. Then they opened his
          locker..cuz of all the ants... In a

          At 6:30 the next morning Whitacre walks across the ADM
          trading floor and straight into Mick Andreas' office looking
          flustered.

                         WHITACRE
          Mick you're not going to believe
          what the hell's happened. I think
          I know the reason why we've been
          having all these problems at the
          plant.

                         ANDREAS
          Well, I've only been asking you to
          come up with one for the past eight
          weeks. I'm all ears.
          Whitacre paces. His story comes out in a rush of words.
          Andreas listens silently.

                         WHITACRE
          It's not start-up problems like we
          thought. It's the Japanese. This
          guy Fujiwara from Ajinomoto, he's
          been calling me-- sometimes at
          work, sometimes at home cuz of the

                          WHITACRE (CONT'D)
           Well last night he calls me at home
          just after 8, and Mick, he knew
           everything. He says to me, `You
          remember the total nightmare you
          had during May, June and July?'
          And before I can ask him what he
          means he says, `Those months when
          ADM was losing about seven million
          dollars a month in the lysine
          business?'
          Whitacre stares at Andreas in shock-- no one outside the
          company should know that. Andreas is still stone faced.

                         WHITACRE
          I couldn't believe it. But, Mick
          before I can even ask him how he
          got those numbers, he starts making
          little comments about us having
          microbe problems. Jokes, like he's
          toying with me.
          Whitacre is fuming now-- his voice unnaturally high.

                         WHITACRE
          And then he tells me that one of
          our highest paid employees is
          actually an employee of Ajinomoto
          and is sabotaging the plant.
          They're injecting some kind of
          virus into the dextrose and
          contaminating the whole deal.
          That's the problem. I'll tell you
          Mick, it's like Rising Sun, that
          Crichton book, it's just like it.
          Fujiwara even said that his boss,
          Ikeda, would have him killed if he
          knew he was calling. So I asked
          him why he was talking to me and he
          said-- he said-- he wants 10
          million dollars. 10 million and
          he'll tell us who the saboteur is
          and give us a new lysine bug that's
          immune to the virus. We could be
          up and running in three days...
          Andreas pauses, takes it all in, and then...

                         ANDREAS
          How well do you know this guy?

                         WHITACRE
          Uh, um, well I met him a few weeks
          ago when he came over. And then,
          he called a couple of times...

                         ANDREAS
          So, not very well?

          Very well? No, I can't really say
          that.
          Andreas ponders the situation.

                         ANDREAS
          Okay, if you hear from him again--
          talk him down on the price. I want
          you to find out the least amount of
          money he'd settle for. If we can
          get a bug that's resistant to the
          virus, it might be worth it...But,
          I want you to keep this quiet, if
          there is a mole, we don't want him
          to know we're onto him.

          Whitacre stands with a cocktail in the fading light, looking
          at the foundation for the NEW HORSE STABLES being built
          across the road from the main house. There is not another
          home anywhere nearby.

          This'd be a great place for some
          outlet stores... People would come
          from all over Southern Illinois and
          probably Missouri, too. Famous
          name brand labels and appliances at
          savings of up to fifty per cent
          every day. Maybe a food court with
          a Mexican place. . .After the
          stables, maybe a tennis court or a
          little pitch and putt by the pool--
          that adds to resale value like
          nobody's business...
          Whitacre looks at the swarm of insects around a street
          light...

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          The birds eat the bugs, the cars
          eat the birds, the rust eats the
          cars and the new construction eats
          the rust...

          Whitacre shakes his head in disbelief. He paces nervously.
          Stunned by the news.

                         WHITACRE
          The FBI! God, no.
          Andreas and MARK CHEVIRON, 38, tell Whitacre of his upcoming
          FBI interview. Cheviron is a barrel chested, linebacker of a
          man. A former Decatur cop who is now Private Industry's
          version of a bouncer.

                         WHITACRE
          I thought I was supposed to be
          getting him down on the price.
          That's what you told me to do and I
          was doing it.

          Of course he's in. If we got a mole
          then it's a security issue...

          I'll be sitting in with the FBI.

                         WHITACRE
          But, I already told you guys
          everything I know. What's the
          point?
          Cheviron is annoyed by Whitacre's histrionics.

                         CHEVIRON
          We don't like the idea of talking
          to the FBI anymore than you do.
          Look, they're just going to tape
          the guy's calls-- and ask you a few
          questions. No big deal.
          Whitacre shakes his head, even more upset.

          The FBI? Why do you need to talk to
          the FBI? It's their factory. Let
          them talk to the FBI.

          WHITACRE (O.S.)
          I'm really uncomfortable about
          this, baby. There are a lot of
          things going on here.

                         GINGER
          What does that mean, "things?"

          15 INTERIOR ADM CONFERENCE ROOM- EVENING 15
           SPECIAL AGENT BRIAN SHEPARD, 43, sits with Cheviron and a
          very anxious Mark Whitacre. Shepard wears a rumpled dark
          suit and tie from the day Jay Edgar Hoover set a dress code.
          He has been stationed in Decatur where the odd dead body in a
          river and a convenience store robbery that traversed state
          lines have made up the last fifteen years of his life.
          Whitacre shifts restlessly in his seat. Cheviron on the other
          hand is an old hand at this. He watches Whitacre and says
          nothing. Shepard writes down everything.

                         WHITACRE
          He told me he wanted his payments
          deposited by wire transfer to
          numbered bank accounts in
          Switzerland and the Caribbean.

                         SHEPARD
          And when was your last contact with
          him?

                         WHITACRE
          Two days ago. But I think he's
          getting suspicious. I've dragged
          this out as long as I can. If we
          don't get back to him soon he may
          back out?

                         SHEPARD
          And these calls, they've been
          coming in on your home line?
          Whitacre looks at Cheviron-- there's clearly a right and
          wrong answer here.

          of his BLACK FBI TIE bobs up and down as he speaks.

          Shepard hands Whitacre his card. They shake hands.

          Cheviron, Whitacre and Mick Andreas. Whitacre is still
          agitated.

                         ANDREAS
          You ever mention to Fujiwara where
          your daughter went to school?

                         CHEVIRON
          If the guy wants to threaten you--
          why not just call you?

                         WHITACRE
          He told her to write down the
          message.

                         ANDREAS
          I want her to tell the FBI what
          they said.
          Andreas moves toward the phone.

                         WHITACRE
          I don't want her talking to the
          FBI, definitely not.

                         CHEVIRON
          Why not, Mark? Come on, if she's
          really in danger.

                         ANDREAS
          Then I'll talk to her.
          Andreas picks up the phone. Whitacre doesn't want that
          either.

                         WHITACRE
          She's scared enough.

                         ANDREAS
          If someone's threatening her...
          A beat. Whitacre collapses-- there's more to this.

                         WHITACRE
          Don't call her...No one's
          threatening. I, uh...
          A long painful beat.

                         WHITACRE
          I made it up. I lied. There wasn't
          any threat.
          Cheviron shakes his head in disgust.

                         CHEVIRON
          Christ, what a waste of time.
          Andreas lowers his gaze at Whitacre-- he wants an
          explanation.

                         WHITACRE
          I'm no good at this. The FBI guy
          really got to me last night.
          He's twisting in the wind.

                         WHITACRE
          I figured if you guys thought my
          daughter was in danger you'd just
          pay Fujiwara and all this FBI stuff
          would go away. It was a stupid
          move on my part.
          Whitacre's ashamed.

                          WHITACRE (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry. Stupid, stupid move.
          He gets up and leaves in humiliation. He wanders through the
          lobby of ADM in a daze.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          What am I supposed to do? I didn't
          get the FBI involved-- I was told
          we were paying the money. It's
          like, `Whitacre go out for a long
          pass,' and then we run the ball.
          Look, I admitted I made a mistake,
          that's more than I can say for most
          people. Hey, when they found out
          that Mick's Dad, Dwayne, wrote a
          check to the Watergate Burglars--
          did he admit it? Besides these guys
          probably own the FBI with the money
          they have. They probably wanted me
          to move into Dwayne's old house--
          because they've got it wired like
          in a Crichton novel...
          He wanders into his office.

           Whitacre and a very done-up Ginger dine with SID HULSE, 35,
          the used car version of a lysine salesman at the Club. Mauve
          draped tables, botanical drawings of the state flower on the
          wall. Bow-tied wait staff patrol the diners with pitchers of
          ice water. Sid and Ginger chit-chat-- Mark is distracted.

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          Someone told me they bugged the
          dining room-- the John, too. Might
          be paying off the waitresses here
          at the club. That's how business
          get done. Clients go to relieve
          themselves. ADM knows...

          Mark got them abroad.

          Whitacre shoots him a look.

                         WHITACRE
          Not funny, Sid.

                         SID HULSE
          You're telling me.
          Sid laughs. Ginger doesn't get the joke.

                         GINGER
          Mark's never been to Nigeria.

          ANGLE ON WHITACRE'S HAND UNDER THE TALE
          He covertly slides a business card into Ginger's hand.

          WHITACRE (O.S.)
          So, where are you off to tomorrow?

          GINGER'S POV OF THE CARD
          On the back is scribbled, "The FBI is coming at 10 PM."

          So, I'll see you in a couple of
          weeks.
          She's still digesting what's on the card-- trying to act
          natural.

                         GINGER
          Then you guys can maybe have a
          chance to play some golf.
          Whitacre throws an arm around her.

          There should be a TV show about a
          guy who calls home one day-- and
          he's there. He answers-- he's
          talking to himself only it's
          someone else. He's somehow divided
          into two and the second one of him
          drives away and the rest of the
          show is about him trying to find
          the guy...

          Should I get Alexander out of the

          It's not like that-- it'll be OK.

          What do they do in school to the

          leave. I don't like what this

                         WHITACRE
          I may tell them at some point, but
          not now. Right now I'm going to
          follow the company line.

                         GINGER
          Mark, ADM is not more powerful than
          the FBI. You can't tell me that.

                         WHITACRE
          It's more complicated than that.
          Her face is a mask of determination.

                         GINGER
          Mark, if you don't tell them I
          will.
          Behind him the drapes are illuminated by headlights in the
          drive. He is desperate-- he softly repeats.

                         WHITACRE
          I can't, not now.
          The door bell rings. She opens the door.

          Good evening, Agent Shepard, this
          is my wife Ginger.

          Everything I told you yesterday
          about Fujiwara was true-- except
          one thing. I never received a call
          from him on the office line.
          Shepard looks at Whitacre-- he's confused.

                         SHEPARD
          Why did you tell me that you did?

                         WHITACRE
          Before I spoke with you, Mick
          Andreas and Mark Cheviron coached
          me on what to say. They told me to
          tell you that the calls came in on
          my business line, instead of my
          home line.

                         SHEPARD
          Why?
          Whitacre pauses again. It's too late to turn back.

                         WHITACRE
          What I'm about to tell you involves
          something very large. This
          extortion attempt by Fujiwara is
          nothing compared to it.
          Shepard says nothing.

                         WHITACRE (CONT'D)
          It involves price fixing in the
          lysine business. I've been in
          several meetings with our Japanese
          and Korean competitors in the past
          few months where the sole purpose
          has been to fix prices. ADM made me
          go to these meetings.
          Shepard writes furiously, struggling to see in the dark.

          That's why they wanted me to lie.
          Fujiwara's calling on my home line.
          But, so are the people we fix
          prices with. They didn't want you
          to hear those conversations so they
          told me to say the Fujiwara calls
          came in on the ADM line. But, I
          knew if you guys ever started
          looking at the records you'd see
          all these calls I have to Japan.
          And that's what scared me. Nobody
          has more calls than me. If you ever
          figured out about the price fixing,
          I'd be the fall guy.
          Shepard considers the explanation.

                         SHEPARD
          Who told you to participate in
          these price fixing talks?
          Whitacre pauses, summons his conviction.

                         WHITACRE
          I'm operating under the direction
          of Mick and Dwayne Andreas.

          A friend who needs his help.
          She walks down the hall pausing by a window. She can see the

          calling until things cool off.

          They're afraid of what you guys
          might find out. Can you give me a
          tape recorder? I can prove this if
          you give me a tape recorder. I'll
          take a polygraph if that helps.
          Shepard is out of pages in his notebook.

                         SHEPARD
          I want to thank you for being
          honest with me tonight.

                         WHITACRE
          You're not going to ask questions
          at ADM about all this? It'd be my
          job for sure.

                         SHEPARD
          No, what was said here was
          confidential. I'm going to speak
          to my superiors Mark, and then
          we'll be in touch.
          Whitacre goes back inside his dark house and heads upstairs--
          he seems unburdened.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          He seems like a real good guy...I
          mean just a straight shooter. I
          think we really got along-- I bet
          he wouldn't mind if I called him
          "Brian" instead of "Agent Shepard."
          "Bri." "Hey, Bri..." This must be
          very different for him. Talking to
          a guy like me instead of a bank
          robber or a drug dealer...

          What a good listener-- you don't
          meet one of those everyday.
          Shepard takes out his cell phone. We hear ringing on the
          other end. A sleepy voice answers.

          first day as a whistle blower. No sooner does he take his
          seat, than Cheviron appears baring down on him though his
          glass walled office.
          Cheviron enters.

          What happened last night?

                         WHITACRE
          They put a recorder on my line.

          And that's it?

                         WHITACRE
          Yeah, and I was instructed that
          when Fujiwara calls, I'm to record
          the conversation.
          Whitacre gets buzzed by his secretary.

          they have ways of checking to see
          if you're going to or not.
          Whitacre picks up the call and the big bully goes away. We
          hear Ginger very excited on the other end of the phone...

          named Regina from the phone company
          called saying both our lines are
          tapped. My home phone!
          Cheviron is sick of Whitacre's antics. He doesn't believe a
          word. It gets a bit heated.

                         CHEVIRON
          Come on, the phone company doesn't
          call people and say, `hello just
          thought we'd let you know, the FBI
          is tapping your phone lines.'

                         WHITACRE

          it.

          Mark, it's Brian can you talk?
          Whitacre shifts uncomfortably and tries to cover in front of
          Mick and Cheviron-- he puts on a phony cheerful voice.

          would have their regular belt style. That's how they
          meetings during the day and stay clean. You could make a

          Paisley takes it all in. He cozies up to Whitacre.

                         AGENT PAISLEY
          Mark, I gotta ask you, why are you
          doing this? We know you lied to us
          about the phone line and you're
          afraid of that. But, now you're
          telling us all this other stuff out
          of the blue. I gotta ask you why?
          The light disappears from Whitacre's eyes.

                         WHITACRE

          of. I mean, I'm a biochemist-- But,

                         WHITACRE
          When they told me to lie, I had to
          lie. I lied to you guys and I feel
          real bad about it.
          This explains the bind Whitacre finds himself in.

                         SHEPARD
          You look at yourself as wearing a
          white hat and they're wearing black
          hats.

                         WHITACRE
          That's a good way to put it. You
          know, when I was a kid my folks
          died in an automobile accident. I
          was maybe six at the time and this
          wealthy man in Ohio adopted me. He
          owned amusement parks and he did
          real well for himself, real well. I
          got a big break-- went to a good
          school and all-- I adopted two kids
          of my own. I just want to do the
          right thing.

                         PAISLEY
          Well, Mark, do you think you'd be
          willing to go a few steps further
          in helping us?

                         WHITACRE
          What do you mean?

                         SHEPARD
          Would you be willing to wear a
          wire? We don't have any other
          sources at this time. We need your
          help.
          Whitacre considers the request-- a chance to be a hero.

                         PAISLEY
          Now you realize that by doing this,
          sometime down the line you could
          be the guy who has to testify
          against your fellow executives,
          people you've worked with now for
          years. That won't be easy.
          He looks around at the good life Whitacre has amassed.

                         SHEPARD
          I'll use my beeper to signal you
          when it's time to set up a meeting.
          Shepard gets out his beeper and hits a button- "BEEEEP."

                         SHEPARD
          When you hear this-- you call me.
          Then Shepard pulls a tape recorder out of his jacket-- a
          simple little Radio Shack Dictaphone model. He gives it to
          Whitacre.

                         PAISLEY
          You'll be risking a lot.
          Whitacre picks up the recorder. The idea of being a White
          Knight only becomes real when they hand you a sword.

          You can go over the limit-- it's

          That's what I was saying. If they
          want a thousand dollars-- you give
          a thousand. So what if it ends up
          costing us nine thousand after the
          fine.

                         WHITACRE
          Twelve thousand after taxes.
          The men laugh.

                         ANDREAS
          If the guy's asking you for money,
          try not giving it to him and see
          what happens. Just make sure Dad is
          behind it... Is Dad asking for them?

                         WILSON
          Yeah.

          Okay then.

          He gets out his cell phone and begins dialing. A FEDEX
          EMPLOYEE walks by with a BUTTERFLY BANDAGE on his nose.

          There are these butterflies in

          men-- stacks of loss, gain and opportunity.

          Everything OK?

                         WHITACRE
          Yeah, fine. Kids. Where we're we?
          Whitacre reaches underneath his suit coat into his shirt
          pocket and pulls out his pen.

                         RICHTER
          Uh, Mark...
          Whitacre's FOUNTAIN PEN has exploded in his shirt-- leaving a
          Rorschach across his chest. Richter gestures toward the
          stain. Whitacre stares at the STAIN.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          One of the Japanese guys told me a
          story-- this lysine salesman is in
          a meeting with someone from Conagra
          or some other company, I don't
          know-and the client leans forward
          and says, `I have the same tie as
          you... only the pattern is
          reversed."-- and then he drops
          dead. Face down on the

          Shepard and Herndon are waiting in the most generic of hotel
          rooms for Whitacre. They check their watches and peak out
          the drapes at a sparsely populated parking lot. They've been
          there awhile. Herndon eats a Granola bar and reads the side
          of the package.

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          .Maybe everyone has a sentence
          like that; a little time bomb..."I
          have the same tie as you... only the
          patterns reversed."

                         HERNDON
          There it is, "High Fructose Corn
          Syrup."
          Shepard isn't giving up on Whitacre, yet.

          He said Andreas called him into a
          marketing meeting.

                         HERNDON
          The government ought to charge him
          for the room.
          Shepard's cell phone rings. Herndon sighs--

                         HERNDON
          Here it comes.

                         SHEPARD
          FBI... .Uh...huh. You're being
          honest with me, here... It's been
          months Mark-- we need some tapes.

          I gotta go Bri, Andreas is coming.
          Whitacre opens his brief case and takes out the micro
          cassette recorder. He looks at it like it's a murder weapon.

          SHEPARD (O.S.)
          (over the phone)
          Mark, we could be tracing this
          phone call...

          I can't live two lives. They just
          gave me a hundred thousand dollar
          raise. I can't risk my job for you
          guys. I've got a family. I'm
          building stables across the road.

          The windows of the BMW are fogging up.

          Mark, listen to me, the only
          logical thing for you to do is
          cooperate.

                         WHITACRE
          And what if I don't?

          SHEPARD (O.S.)
          Then somebody else will and you'll
          end up being a defendant.

                         WHITACRE
          For how long, Brian? How long does
          this go on for?
          Whitacre pushes the buttons on the recorder. He hits eject.
          There's no tape in the cradle.

          SHEPARD (O.S.)
          I wish I could answer that.
          Sometimes years. We'll need a lot
          of tapes-- maybe hundreds.

                         WHITACRE
          But, the tapes won't say anything.
          It's over. Mick said.. .New policy.

          SHEPARD (O.S.)
          Fine, if that's what he said, then
          I want to hear the tape. We need
          tapes, Mark.
          A beat-- he finally admits it. The windows are completely
          fogged.

                         WHITACRE
          I didn't make any, OK? I didn't
          make any because it's over. How can
          I prove it to you?

          pressure cuff and puts electrical clips on his fingers.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          I like my hands. I think they're
          probably my favorite part of my
          body. I think that can be used to
          my advantage in social situations--
          if I can get people focused on my
          hands then I can get a good result
          in the meeting.

          Herndon takes out a list of questions and watches Whitacre
          closely. Shepard watches the needle on the polygraph.

          SHEPARD WHITACRE (V.0.)
          Now, Bob's going to ask you What do we lose-- a liter of

          We're you born in 1957?

          Yes.

                         HERNDON
          Did Fujiwara ever telephone you at
          home and tell you there was a mole
          at ADM?

                         WHITACRE
          Yes.

          I wonder where Bob carries his gun.
          FBI agents have to wear them at all

          I know it's tough keeping it all
          bottled up inside, keeping it a
          secret. But, there's only one good
          choice for you. That's all there's
          ever been. There's something
          you're hiding, something you're
          keeping from us. But, the only way
          to protect yourself is to be
          completely honest.

                         WHITACRE
          Okay.
          Shepard gets another form out of his brief-case. Not a basic
          302 this time-- it's A CONFESSION.

                         SHEPARD
          You realize this document can be
          used against you in a court of law.
          Whitacre nods grimly.

          Shepard and Herndon cringe on his behalf. The floodgates
          open. Shepard transcribes the confession.

          .We've had problems at the plant
          with viruses, we're way behind
          projections. Dwayne was thinking
          about shutting us down and everyone
          was on me to fix it. 'Let's just
          blame it all on Whitacre.' That's
          how it is there. It was my job they

          thought it would help my
          relationship with Mick if he
          thought I would do something like
          that.

                         HERNDON

          isn't over is it? There's no "new

          and gets out of the car.

          He walks toward the building. As the camera arcs around to
          lead him we see that he is actually speaking out loud-- NOT
          IN VO. To nobody...

          Seven thirty A.M., Wednesday, March
          seventeenth, 1994. I have just
          parked my car and am now entering
          the office...
          Whitacre gets on the elevator with Terry Wilson. Whitacre's
          a little off this morning...
          s-- WHITACRE (CONT'D)
          Terrance Wilson, President of our
          corn businesses, did you speak with
          our friends in Japan?

                         TERRY WILSON
          He wasn't in.

                         WHITACRE
          I heard from Mimoto last night-- he
          is pissed. He said there's not
          going to be any peace in lysine
          until we bring production down like
          we promised.
          Theelevator doors opens.

                         TERRY WILSON
          In 92 we did exactly what we told
          them we would do in terms of
          volume. Exactly. Right now, there's
          no promise.

                         WHITACRE
          He said he'd like to talk to you at
          some point...

          "listen here you little mousy
          motherfucker."
          Wilson peels off into his office. Whitacre continues on
          across the open trading floor toward his office. He speaks
          under his breath to nobody-- smiling at the world.

                         WHITACRE
          That was Terry Wilson talking about
          setting volume and price levels
          with our Japanese competitor--
          Ajinomoto Corporation.
          Whitacre enters his own office--- talking to himself.

                         WHITACRE (CONT'D)
          By the way, there was no discussion
          with Mimoto last night. That was
          all for illustration purposes only.
          I wanna make that clear- no
          discussion with Mimoto last night.
          He turns off the tape recorder.

          Hey, Mark you don't really need to
          narrate the tapes for us when
          you're making them.

                         WHITACRE
          Right. Absolutely. Not a problem.

                         HERNDON
          And you can talk less.

                         WHITACRE
          I think I did on this one.
          Whitacre gives Herndon another tape and a small box.

                         SHEPARD
          Don't force the conversation.

                         WHITACRE

          I've got well over two million
          frequent flier miles.. .maybe more.
          The equivalent of two trips to the
          moon. I'm pretty much platinum
          across the board. Free
          upgrades... sometimes they'll move
          me from business to first just cuz
          the computer tells them I'm
          there...

          It's like 5000 miles every time I
          go to Zurich, Paris, Munich...1
          don't even know how many miles are
          in the Delta account...I just give
          Ginger the statements... I'm
          probably one of the youngest guys
          ever to go over a million miles...I
          get a letter from the CEO every
          year thanking me...it's a form
          letter, but it looks like he's
          really signing it...They probably
          walk in one day and he signs like a
          hundred while he's on the phone...
          Whitacre gets out of the car and walks into the embassy.
          Shepard meets him an ushers him into a room where a phone is
          hooked up to a recorder.

          The call rings through.

          from Paris for Mick Andreas...Hey,

          lysine meeting... It went great...I
          think we can keep it at around a
          buck and a quarter no problem...
          Andunder... Shepard sneezes.

          He follows Shepard's hands from Kleenex, to coffee cup, to
          pen, to a tug on his ear...

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          Now what happens? Something you
          breathe in on an airplane. Some
          little bacteria and now it's on his

          with ADM emblazoned on it. He turns into the bathroom and
          stares at himself in the mirror. He checks his HAIR and then
          opens the FOLDER. He removes the legal pad to reveal a

          That's a big break, right there--
          definitely. There's no choices to
          be made. No debate. It's there--
          you're an ant-- you eat it-- you

          I'm at a meeting. Tensing.
          Holding. And then releasing. And

          know their noses are black? From
          looking at other polar bears? Do
          they see their reflections in the
          water? And think, "I'd be invisible
          if not for that." That seems like
          a lot of thinking for a bear.

          There's something great about
          walking into a conference room when
          there's a pad of paper and a pencil
          in front of every chair. . .Most guys
          with a science background don't get
          to see what goes on...

          Usually the hotel's name is
          embossed on the pencils and they
          have someone who sharpens them to
          perfect points like collie dog
          noses-- that's what they remind me
          of. Maybe they come from the
          factory that way. And there's
          always a plate of
          danish...danishes?-- an almond
          thing-- or a cheese danish with a
          big cherry blob in the middle...

          The AFRICAN AMERICAN AGENT finishes shaving Whitacre's chest.
          He takes out a roll of surgical tape and attaches a small

          sewn into Whitacre's pants pockets.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          The almond thing makes a lot of
          crumbs and I usually use my pencil
          to sweep them away like one of

          use at the Decatur Club...

          Good luck with the Japs. And as
          your lawyer I'd advise you to pat
          `em down for wires.
          Andreas laughs at the suit, but Whitacre's not laughing. The
          limo pulls away.

          directors at ADM is gonna

          Ikeda goes over to the easel and makes a PIE CHART as a
          visual aid for Andreas' proposal.

          ANDREAS (V.0.)
          You gotta remember we have a lot
          more capacity than we're using. We
          could be growing twenty thousand
          tons, isn't that right, Mark?

          I wonder if Brian and Bob are
          really allowed to do that-- it
          seems kind of shady...I probably
          should've gotten them to sign
          something just in case. Turned the

          Tarrance responds with a string of expletives and threats to
          knock McDeere's teeth down his throat. His verbal assault is
          put to a halt when his phone rings. It's Holly Hunter
          calling from the nearby parking lot. She plays Tarrance an
          incriminating tape of what he has just said. McDeere is
          wearing a wire. McDeere has him now.

          She turns on the light to discuss her concerns. Mark is
          standing there without his shirt on-- A LARGE PATCH OF HAIR
          is missing from the middle of his chest.

                         WHITACRE
          What's wrong with that?

                         GINGER
          What's wrong? Why is your chest

          aren't you a part of this family
          anymore?
          Whitacre tries to laugh off her concern. He sits down on the
          bed and puts her hand on his smooth chest.

          I want to give this family

          Warm summer day-- out the window the smoke stacks of ADM send
          plumes of white smoke into the blue sky. Shepard and Herndon
          sit in their SHIRTSLEEVES transcribing tapes in the tiny
          office. There's a knock on the door. Shepard checks to see
          who it is through the eye-hole. Whitacre enters wearing the
          SAGE COLORED SUIT- full of confidence.

          Hey guys, I was in the

                         WHITACRE
          And that's not all. I'd say that
          ten of the products produced by ADM
          are price fixed.

                         SHEPARD
          Ten?

                         WHITACRE
          I would estimate that for all the
          companies involved, the total extra
          profit is in the range of 800
          million to one billion dollars.
          That's just from the price-fixing.

                         SHEPARD
          Can you tell us what products?
          Whitacre smiles-- he's got something else on his mind.

                         WHITACRE
          You know, Brian, if all these
          companies are charged, they're
          going to be paying an awful lot in
          fines. Don't you think?

                         SHEPARD
          I don't know, they might end up
          paying. But, nobody knows for sure
          how this will turn out.

                         HERNDON
          We still need to get everyone
          together making an actual agreement
          before we have a case.

                         WHITACRE
          Sure, sure I know that. But, I've
          taken a lot of risks and I need to
          think about my family.

                         SHEPARD
          What do you mean?

                         WHITACRE
          Well, I'd like it if, in their
          fine, ADM was ordered to pay me ten
          year's salary.

                         SHEPARD
          Well, Mark...

          I never expected this investigation
          would go on as long as it has. It's
          been almost two years and I think I
          should get total immunity if I
          agree to cooperate through the end.

          focussed the full power of the blower on it but it's not
          going anywhere. Three deer stand like statues in the yard,
          oblivious to the rain.

          We got a deer problem here.
          They're in the corn, they're eating
          the small trees, they charge into
          the road. Too many deer. Take
          away all the predators and that's
          going to happen.. .No bears, no

          And then one gets sick and they all

           friend who is passing by.

          Hey, Kirk, I'm gonna be heading off
          to Europe and I was thinking I'd
          deliver the check for the ABP deal
          in person.

                         SCHMIDT

          some substantial improvements and
          we need to get it into the market.
          I got the invoice somewhere...
          He fishes it out of a pile of papers and slides it across the
          desk.

                         SCHMIDT
          We can overnight it.

                         WHITACRE
          Nah, I'm gonna see this
          Thorstensson guy. I'll just hand it
          to him.

          Out the window of the office Andreas looks at the tote board

          Competitors are our friends,
          remember? Customers the enemy.
          The group nods in agreement with Whitacre's translation. JM
          SUH of Cheil Corporation takes issue with this. The two
          argue... Whitacre looks at SUH, who is LOSING HIS HAIR...

          If the market is what we think it
          is...
          There's a KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Conversation ceases.

                         WHITACRE
          We have a couple other people
          joining us I think?
          MR. CHAUDRET from EUROLYSINE is making himself a fruit plate.

          MR. CHAUDRET
          From Sewon in Korea.

                         MIMOTO
          And one from the FBI?
          Whitacre freezes. He's caught. He looks at the business
          men... DO THEY ALL KNOW?

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          That's why there can't be any
          leaves on the walk. They give it
          away-Like the ants-- they can see
          a trail of ants...
          Mimoto smiles right at Whitacre-- the walls close in, and
          then, the room bursts into laughter. Whitacre gets it. He
          smiles back.

          Whitacre opens the door to find HERNDON DRESSED LIKE A HOTEL

          This was left in the lobby. The
          concierge thought it might belong
          to one of you gentleman.

          The group laughs.

          If we can't trust each other in the

          What do you mean?

                         MUTCHNIK
          What's his agenda? The guy's making
          350 grand a year, he's moving up
          the ladder and he turns informer.
          When does that happen? Is the
          money going up his nose? Some woman
          somewhere with a kid that he's
          seeing on one of these business
          trips? What's his story?
          Shepard and Herndon are offended on behalf of Mark. Herndon
          reaches into his briefcase and pulls out a GREETING CARD.

                         HERNDON
          I wanted everyone to see this.
          This is Mark Whitacre and his

          that he is a real person with a

          pick from. You gotta understand,
          these attorneys are being paid by
          ADM. They don't represent you. Do
          not take one of these attorneys,
          that's when you say to them that
          you have your own attorney.

          Come on Mark, you're making that
          up.

                         WHITACRE
          No, it's true. Archer, The "A" in
          ADM, choked to death on a chicken
          bone in 1947.

                         TERRY WILSON
          There you have it from Mark
          Whitacre, Ph.D. You know what the
          Ph.D. is for? Piled Higher and
          Deeper.

          So, a chicken got Archer-- but
          fifty years later when you look at
          our deals with Tyson, Foster Farms--
          what's the body count?
          More laughter. The agents walk up to the table.

                         HERNDON
          Excuse me. Mr. Wilson, Mr.
          Whitacre-- I'm Bob Herndon and I'm
          an FBI agent. This is Special
          Agent Shepherd.

          Wilson is baffled. Whitacre feigns surprise-- they both look
          to their client.

                         TERRY WILSON
          I have no idea what this is.
          Wilson gets up from the table. Whitacre is shaken.

          Do I need an attorney.

                         WHITACRE
          Attorney? Christ.

                         HERNDON
          Mr. Whitacre, if I can ask you to
          step outside with Agent Shepard and
          Mr. Wilson, if you could have a
          seat.
          The men move away from the table leaving the Visiting Client
          baffled and all alone-- a STUNNED WAITRESS approaches him.

          Hey, I had to tell my secretary. I
          told her a long time ago. I just
          said, "look I'm working with the
          FBI on some things, I may be out of

          Shepard still glares.

                         WHITACRE
          And, uh, I've probably mentioned
          Kathy Dougherty, in my division.
          She's a dear friend and a trusted
          ally. I didn't want her to be
          scared.

          you tell Dougherty?

          be scared. And I can trust her.
          Guys, I can trust her.

          past this. But is there anything
          else we need to know? Anything?

          Selenium deficiency in chicks
          causes reduced growth and
          pancreatic atrophy and increased

          talk.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          It feels good to talk, to clear the
          air-- you get to be like a balloon
          after a while. A balloon looking
          for a pin to bump into and relieve
          the pressure. You could get sick
          from keeping it inside and get a
          tumor or something..I didn't ask
          for that. Why should I pay for my
          own legal fees when I'm not the one
          who started the price fixing.

          know all about lysine. John here
          agrees I should be getting another

          No question about it.
          Dowd and Daniel share a knowing look. An uncomfortable
          silence follows.

          Mark, it's very important to your
          case that you not discuss it with
          anyone else. These people you work
          with, your friends, they could end
          up being witnesses. So Bob and I
          are the only people I want you to
          talk to about this from now on and
          I want you to know you can tell us
          anything.

          me to put out a story they're not
          going to confirm... It would be
          crazy.

          ANGLE ON THE PAPERWORK
          Contracts citing various sums of money and photo-copies of
          checks.

          ROBERTS HOLDS TWO PAGES UP TO THE LIGHT. AND THEN RUNS DOWN

          THE HALL WITH THE PAGES.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          It's all on tape, everything that
          happened.

          141 INTERIOR ADM- MICK ANDREAS OFFICE- EVENING 141
          Mick, Dwayne, Roberts and Aubrey Daniel stand before the
          window. The pages are taped to the window.

          ANGLE ON THE PAGES
          The two signatures eclipse each other perfectly.

                         ROBERTS
          You can see where he pasted it.
          Aubrey Daniel picks up the phone barely able to contain his
          glee.

          142 INTERIOR WHITACRE'S CAR- SIMULTANEOULSY 142
          Whitacre races the Ferrari down a two-lane in the middle of
          the farm fields of South Central Illinois. The phone rings
          and he answers cheerfully.

                         WHITACRE
          Mark Whitacre.

          AUBREY DANIEL (O.S.)
          Hello, Mark? It's Aubrey Daniel.
          I think you forgot something?
          Whitacre pulls over onto the shoulder. He looks at the cell
          phone in dismay and stares at a Polaroid of himself from the
          Fortune Magazine photo shoot-- he's smiling in the picture.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          One of the things I've learned in
          business is that you should always
          use a person's name in conversation
          if you want them to feel
          important... Sid Hulse and Marty
          Allison think that and they're very
          successful salesman...

          143 EXTERIOR CHINESE RESTAURANT, TAYLORVILLE- DAY 143
          Whitacre gets out of an FBI cruiser with Herndon and Shepard
          and the three men walk toward the restaurant in rural
          Illinois.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          It makes people feel like they're
          definitely being told something
          they can use...
          They enter and the HOSTESS gives them a table up front.

                         WHITACRE
          You got anything open in the back?

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          Just by putting their name in there
          at the beginning or the end.
          The men sit at a table in the back.
          A beat.

                         WHITACRE
          Brian, Bob, my attorney's telling
          me not to say anything, but there's
          something I've wanted to talk about
          for awhile.

                         HERNDON
          Don't tell us anything. You have an
          attorney now. This isn't like
          before. Let's just talk.
          Shepard tries to change the subject.

                         SHEPARD
          You been playing any golf?
          Whitacre doesn't want to "just talk."

                         WHITACRE
          They want to talk to me at ADM.

                         HERNDON
          Mark, you understand your lawyer
          has advised you not to discuss this
          matter?

                         SHEPARD
          We're not asking you.

                         WHITACRE
          Let me throw out some
          "hypotheticals." I'll talk about
          some financial situations and you
          tell me if they're wrong or how
          serious they might be, OK? For
          instance, suppose a company gave an
          executive a car, you know, a
          corporate car. But instead of
          driving it to work he drove his
          personal car and gave the company
          car to his daughter. Would that be
          a problem?

                         HERNDON
          That's it? That's the hypothetical?
          The agents try not to laugh. After what Whitacre has given
          the government-- a little undeclared perk is nothing.

                         SHEPARD
          That shouldn't be a problem.

                         WHITACRE
          What about if an executive used a
          corporate plane for personal use?

                         HERNDON
          Basically, it's the same thing.

                         SHEPARD
          There may be some IRS issues but...

                         WHITACRE
          What if, hypothetically, the
          activity involved kickbacks by
          corporate executives?

                         I

                         HERNDON
          There are plenty of ways companies
          try and attract business. Dinners
          for clients, tickets for sporting
          events...

                         SHEPARD
          It's not ethical but it's done.
          A beat. Then Whitacre goes on.

                         WHITACRE
          Uh, is this conversation on or off
          the record?

                         SHEPARD
          On. Definitely.
          Whitacre exhales.

                         WHITACRE
          What if the company regularly
          accepted kickbacks to executives in
          the form of cash?
          Shepard drops his fork. Hold on Shepard.

                         SHEPARD
          How much money are we talking about
          Mark?
          Whitacre pauses, clears his throat.

                         WHITACRE
          Five hundred thousand.

                         HERNDON
          How much???
          Whitacre shrinks from the admission like a puppy who just
          crapped on the rug.

                         WHITACRE
          It's how things were done there.

                         SHEPARD
          When did this start, Mark?

                         WHITACRE
          December of 1991.
          Shepard can't believe it.

                         SHEPARD
          You, You... And how were you paid?

          By check. They we're deposited in
          various accounts. And always under
          10,000 dollars.

                         SHEPARD
          And did any of these checks come in
          after we met?
          Whitacre pauses.

                         WHITACRE
          Maybe a couple.
          The agents try and control their anger.

                         SHEPARD
          Who else knows about this?

                         WHITACRE
          Nobody.
          Herndon loses it.

                         HERNDON
          Come on, Mark-- you just said it's
          how things were done at ADM. Now,
          is there anything else you're
          involved in? Anything else you need
          to tell us?

                         WHITACRE
          Just what I told you.

                         HERNDON
          I'm asking you one more time.

                         WHITACRE
          The 500 and that's it. Definitely.
          Whitacre nods. He asks hopefully...

                         WHITACRE
          This isn't going to affect the
          price-fixing case, is it?
          The three men get up to leave.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          I feel good about that. Hey, I
          don't see what the big deal is.
          They said help us with the price
          fixing and I did-- the two things
          are totally unrelated...

          Aubrey Daniel and a PHALANX OF A LAWYERS ascend the steps of

          DOJ.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          Besides, Mick knew about it,
          definitely... He's the one who
          taught me to do it in the first
          place.

          145 INTERIOR DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, WASHINGTON DC- DAY 145
          Aubrey Daniel and a cadre of CORPORATE ATTORNEYS sit at a
          conference table with Mann, Mutchnik and U.S. ASST. ATTORNEY
          GENERAL GARY SPRATLING. An overhead projector displays the
          forged contracts on the wall.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          When you look at what went on with
          all the price fixing they did or
          the Federal Building being bombed
          in Oklahoma City, why are we
          focusing on me getting a half-
          million in kick-backs along with
          everyone else?

                         AUBREY DANIEL
          Two point five million dollars.
          Deposited in a bank in Switzerland
          while Mark Whitacre was on ADM
          business. We have sworn testimony
          from Mr. Lennart Thorstensson of
          the ABP Corporation that he's never
          seen this contract before and that
          his signature has been forged. He
          and his company never received this
          check...
          As Daniel speaks one of the younger lawyers passes out a
          folder of affidavits and other documents supporting his
          claims.

                         AUBREY DANIEL
          It is clear to us that Mark
          Whitacre, driven by his own
          boundless ambition to take over
          ADM, has attempted to frame his
          superiors in a price fixing
          conspiracy of his own invention so
          that he could seize control of the
          company...

          Mann and Mutchnik can't believe what they're seeing in the
          black folders.

                         AUBREY DANIEL
          His cooperation with the government
          is merely a smokescreen for his
          lying and stealing. We have
          additional information that we are
          prepared to share with Attorney
          General Reno that the money has
          been moved to an account in Grand
          Cayman with the full knowledge and
          complicity of Whitacre's FBI
          partners...
          And under...
          The DOJ lawyers stare at the table-- searching for the rest
          of their careers.

          Whitacre is out with the leaf blower-- the driveway is
          spotless. The MOON is up during the day.

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          I wonder if there's a name for
          that. We don't have very many
          moons compared to other planets.
          What does Jupiter have? Eleven.
          They aren't scientists-- Mick and
          Dwayne-- they don't have Ph. D.'s.,
          but I'm the one having to pull my
          kids out of school for doing the
          right thing...

          147 INTERIOR FBI SPRINGFIELD- DAY 147
          Shepard and Herndon appear before their bosses-- Paisley and
          Medford. Shepard is irate, Herndon is a little more
          circumspect.

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          They need to dig deep, then they'll
          find out how high it goes-- it's
          there they just need to look and
          they'll see...

          What are they accusing me of?
          I want the specifics? Are they
          saying I'm in cahoots with the guy?
          Medford and Paisley don't want to answer this.

                         MEDFORD
          Paragraph eight in our agreement
          with Whitacre states that his
          actions are directly attributable
          to the FBI and the US...

                         SHEPARD
          But, how could we know what he was
          doing? He came to us...

                         PAISLEY
          The question they're asking isn't
          `how could we know?' It's `why
          didn't we know?'

                         HERNDON
          The question is `were they fixing
          prices?'
          Medford and Paisley share a look.

                         MEDFORD
          The investigation has shifted from
          ADM to Whitacre.

                         SHEPARD
          Of course, ADM decides Whitacre's a
          thief as soon as they find out he's
          working for us.

                         HERNDON
          Who's counting the money over there
          if they can just lose 2.5 Million
          dollars for a few years and then
          find it in a few hours?

                         SHEPARD
          We gotta call Mark.

                         PAISLEY
          I don't want you doing that.
          Shepard and Herndon are confused.

                         MEDFORD
          We're taking you off.

          That's it. We're done? I thought
          the FBI never hung a witness out to
          dry.

                         MEDFORD
          He's not a witness anymore--- he's a
          target.

          A Sunday afternoon. Epstein and Zaideman try and get a hand
          on the scope of Whitacre's fraud. Whitacre has shoe boxes of
          receipts and bank statements.

                         WHITACRE
          I only kept a million and a half--
          and Mick knew about it, he knew
          these things went on. They taught
          me how to do it.
          Zaideman and Epstein shake their heads.

                         EPSTEIN
          You can't bullshit these people
          tomorrow. Who knows what they know?
          If we're going in there we got to
          go in with the whole story. Because
          the way it gets bad for you is if
          you tell them you're confessing and
          you don't. Then you are sorely
          screwed.
          Whitacre looks at his shoe box. He nods.

                         WHITACRE
          This is everything Jim, what I'm
          telling you here. I looked
          everywhere for the bank statements
          and the records. This is every
          penny-- I'm not gonna hide anything
          from you guys.

          Whitacre enters the building with Epstein and Zaideman.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          I was never really that good at
          chemistry in high school. So I
          kept taking it-- just to get good
          and wound up with so many chemistry
          credits I ended up going into Bio-
          Chem.

          Whitacre, Epstein and Zaideman- on the way into battle.
          Whitacre is strangely placid.

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          That's really the truth about that--
          I wanted to be a veterinarian when
          I was kid-- I raised chickens and
          rabbits ...Biochem was my advisor's
          idea...

                         WHITACRE
          Listen, I haven't been telling you
          the whole truth. I'll clear it up
          in there today.

                         ZAIDEMAN
          What?
          OH, SHIT. Epstein starts desperately hitting elevator buttons
          to stop the approaching doom.

                         EPSTEIN
          We got to get you out of here.
          But, it's too late the doors open. Whitacre steps out.

                         WHITACRE
          No. I want to tell them.
          Hold on Epstein.

          151 INTERIOR DEPT. OF JUSTICE CONFERENCE ROOM- CHICAGO 151
          Whitacre surrounded by Epstein and Zaideman who can only
          imagine which way their loose cannon will roll. Across from
          the DOJ lawyers as far as the eye can see.

                         ROBIN MANN
          Mr. Whitacre's conduct constitutes
          a breach of his agreement with the
          US government. He is no longer a
          cooperating witness.

                         EPSTEIN
          My client has given you years of
          his life, clearly he made mistakes,
          but he made your case.

                         ROBIN MANN
          We're not here to discuss the case
          against ADM.

          Draft: 1/15/03 126.

                         I
          ED HERBST, early 50's, and MARY SPEARING, 40's, take over--
          they take no prisoners.

                         HERBST
          Mr. Whitacre, my name is Ed Herbst
          and I'm with the FBI Economic
          Crimes Unit. I'd like you to tell
          me when your criminal conduct at
          ADM began.

                         WHITACRE
          In early 1992. I learned how
          things were done there from Mick
          Andreas. He's the one who taught
          me how to use embezzlement and
          kickbacks to make money tax free.
          Epstein tries to do some damage control.

                         EPSTEIN
          My client is...

                         WHITACRE
          I know the frauds I committed are
          wrong, and I accept responsibility
          for them.

                         HERBST
          How did you receive the money?

                         WHITACRE
          Primarily by check. I deposited
          them in my bank account in Decatur.
          This seems unlikely. Spearing gets angry--

                         MARY SPEARING
          They paid kickbacks in checks?
          What company would pay kickbacks in
          checks? Come on...
          No one from the government has ever been aggressive toward
          Whitacre before-- he's thrown.

                         WHITACRE
          I don't really remember the exact
          name... something like
          AgriConsulting and Trading,
          something like that...

                         MARY SPEARING
          You don't remember the name of the
          company that paid you checks?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Draft: 1/15/03 127.

                         WHITACRE
          I. .I've got a lot going on in my
          life. It's hard to remember.

                         EPSTEIN
          Hey, we're coming to you guys.
          We're cooperating here and we're
          going to get the money back.
          Epstein looks at Whitacre-- this last part might be hard.

                         HERBST
          This might help your memory.
          He slides the forged ABP documents toward Whitacre.

                         WHITACRE
          Where did you get that?

                         HERBST
          These are ADM records showing the
          forging of signatures.
          Whitacre smiles and shakes his head. He sees the conspiracy
          plainly.

          WHITACRE WHITACRE (V.0.)
          See, that's how they keep Didn't these people see The
          people in the fold-- they Firm-- or read the book.
          tell you to take the money It's all there. Everything
          and then they use it against they did to me they did to
          you if you talk. It's how Tom Cruise... I'm not the one
          they control us. You gotta they should be mad at...
          realize who these people
          are...

                         MARY SPEARING
          Is there anything else you have a
          hard time remembering?
          Whitacre looks at Epstein. Epstein shakes his head "no" but
          Whitacre has other plans.

                         WHITACRE
          Umm...I have a few other things to
          tell you about.
          Epstein sighs.

                         WHITACRE
          There were some things I did in
          Mexico...

          PULL BACK FROM CONFERENCE ROOM
          As Whitacre spills his guts the lawyers look on in
          bewilderment ... The man is unhinged.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          I raised white mice, too. Chickens
          and goats and white mice in little
          cages. They couldn't come in the
          house. I took care of them-- that
          was my job outside. One got in one
          time, I don't know how, and he was
          found dead by my Mother. This had
          nothing to do with anything I had
          done-- he just had died and it was
          up to me to bring him back to life.
          I wanted to do the right thing and
          wear the white hat and that's why I
          tried to make it all right so he
          wouldn't have to be dead. All the
          things I did were for that-- but I
          couldn't.

          152 INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION LIVING ROOM- NIGHT 152
          Shepard, Herndon, Ginger and Whitacre. Mark looks used up--
          his hair seems to be graying around the edges. In front of
          him are a pile of newspapers-- Washington Post, WSJ, Chicago
          Tribune, etc. Each with a banner announcement of his sins.

                         HERNDON
          We can't see you anymore and if you
          call us and start to talk about it,
          we'll have to hang up...

                         SHEPARD
          You can talk to us about your
          feelings, but that's it.
          Shepard puts his coffee cup down near the newspapers.

          ANGLE ON WSJ
          7/13/95 Headline reads: YOU DIRTY RAT, SAYS DECATUR ILLINOIS-

          PEOPLE THINK MARK WHITACRE BETRAYED THEM AND ASR WHY HE

          TURNED TO THE FBI.
          Whitacre nods-- he can't play with his friends any more.

                         SHEPARD
          Mark, please understand. This
          isn't what we want. We've got no
          choice here.

                         WHITACRE
          I'll tell you what, my frustration
          and anger is all coming from my
          work with you guys. I mean, this
          stuff in the papers, my kids read
          that. It's all, "Dump on Mark
          Whitacre." It's not right. I'm
          harassed by the media and Mick and
          Terry are still going to work in
          the morning.

                         SHEPARD
          Remember, Mark, we told you it was
          impossible to predict what would
          happen when the case went overt.

                         HERNDON
          And you never told us about the
          Five Million Dollars you took...
          Ginger has heard this before and can't hear it again.

                         GINGER
          He worked for you for two and a
          half years, he risked his career,
          his home.. .And now you turn your
          back on him and leave us out here.

                         WHITACRE
          Ginger...
          But the damn has burst. She sobs.

                         SHEPARD
          The reason we came today is because
          we are concerned about your and
          Mark's well being.

                         HERNDON
          It's important that you tell the
          people in Washington everything
          tomorrow-- one hundred per cent.
          Whitacre nods. Ginger seethes.

                         GINGER
          You'd have nothing without him and
          you know it. He's just been used
          by the government and then thrown
          away cuz' it's a lot easier to go
          after Mark Whitacre than anyone
          named Andreas.
          Whitacre stares at the newspapers.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          I think a lot of people would come--
          a lot of friends... and people would
          be surprised by just how many there
          are. Even folks from ADM... The news
          media would be there for sure...

          153 INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION- MASTER BEDROOM- DAWN 153
          Whitacre is sitting on the bed up and dressed when the alarm
          goes off. He lies across his wife on the bed-- more like a
          child than a husband.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          .Everything would come out.
          Brian and Bob would come and I bet
          one of them would say something
          about me. Rheinhard would come up
          from Mexico. Sid or Marty would
          tell people what kind of boss I was
          and how I always brought back
          presents...

                         WHITACRE
          You'll be OK here with your mom?
          Ginger nods groggily. Whitacre leaves the room-- grabbing a
          PICTURE OF HIS FAMILY from a bedside table.

          154 EXTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION GARAGE- MORNING 154
          Whitacre opens the garage door and we see the entire fleet of
          cars he has amassed-- 5 Million dollars buys a lot of
          steering wheels. Ferrari, Range Rover, Jeep, etc. Whitacre
          selects the BMW convertible. He gets in the car and puts his
          brief case in the seat next to him. He opens it and we see
          the contents: HUNDREDS OF ARTICLES ABOUT WHITACRE. A
          scrapbook from a roller coaster ride. He starts the car and
          guns the engine.

          ANGLE ON THE GARAGE
          The Beemer does not back up-- THE GARAGE DOOR COMES DOWN.

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          Jesus died on a cross to save
          others from their sins. Jesus was
          a hero. I know selfish suicide is
          forbidden in the bible.

          RUSTY the gardener shows up for work. He gets out of his
          Pick-Up and kicks a few leaves off the driveway, he adds some
          chemicals to the pool and then walks toward the garage-- as
          he's fishing some keys out of his pocket he notices the sound
          of a car engine.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)

          loved ones.

          157 INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION GARAGE- CONTINUOUS 157
          The air is thick with smoke. Whitacre is motionless sprawled
          in the backseat-- drenched in sweat clutching the PICTURE OF

          HIS FAMILY.

                         RUSTY
          Jesus, no. Somebody help.
          Rusty throws the car in reverse and pulls out.

          ANGLE ON WHITACRE
          He opens an eye, but as Rusty looks down at him again he
          closes it-- plays dead.
          The car is outside now. Rusty turns off the engine.
          Whitacre sighs heavily.

                         WHITACRE
          Bud, pull the car back into the
          garage. Pull back in before
          somebody sees me.
          Rusty pulls the car back in and turns it off. The smoke is
          still clearing.

                         RUSTY
          Jesus, Mark, what are you doing?
          Whitacre still stretched out in the backseat stares up at the
          ceiling-- explodes.

                         WHITACRE
          You...You fucking God. You owe me.
          You fucking God. After everything
          I did.
          Rusty is shocked by the outburst-- this is not the guy he
          knows at all. He backs away from the car and picks up the
          garage phone.

                         RUSTY
          Ginger, can you come to the garage?

          GINGER (O.S.)
          Why? Rusty, what's wrong?

                         RUSTY
          I just need to talk to you.

                         GINGER
          I'm not coming down there unless
          you tell me what's wrong.

                         RUSTY
          Mark just tried to kill himself
          and...
          Ginger's piercing scream comes down the phone line. Whitacre
          is fetal in the backseat-- moaning.
          Ginger and HER MOTHER come flying out of the house screaming.
          They pull Mark out of the car toward the open air as he
          stumbles, coughing, the family picture clatters across the
          garage floor. Whitacre jumps on it like a grenade.

          genial, soft-spoken. This is not internal, it's therapy.

          .Walk back in with a bag full of
          jewelry.

                         MILLER
          You never thought you'd get caught?

                         WHITACRE
          That never occurred to me. I mean,
          I look respectable. Why would they
          search me? And now they're saying I
          stole 5 Million dollars. That's
          what I've been accused of.

                         MILLER
          Did you?

                         WHITACRE
          Yeah. They were paying me 500
          grand, but it wasn't enough, I was
          spending more like eight. So, I
          took kickbacks. Like I said, it's
          just what you did if you wanted to
          be part of the gang at ADM.

                         MILLER
          Is that how it was when you were a
          kid; you wanted to be part of the
          gang?

          One time I got a brand new, top of
          the line bicycle. And I bragged to
          everyone about it. I told
          everybody how much it cost.
          A beat. Then proudly.

                         WHITACRE
          It cost ninety dollars.

                         MILLER
          How did you come to work for the

          FBI?

                         WHITACRE
          They approached me.
          This doesn't make much sense to Miller.

                         MILLER
          How is it that they came to you?
          Did they know about the price
          fixing?

                         WHITACRE
          This agent, Brian Shepard came to a
          number of junior executives at
          ADM... That's why they approached
          me. The price fixing hadn't even
          started yet...
          Miller is confused by this.

                         MILLER
          But, uh, if no crime was,
          then-Mark, I'd like to have you
          checked into the hospital.
          Whitacre looks over at a file cabinet.

          I was always the one with the

          but that's changed too. Since he
          said he'd cooperate with the FBI--
          he's become so intolerant of

          Have you ever heard that Mark told
          people he was adopted?

          NEVER SEEN BEFORE
          It was in the paper that he was
          adopted.

                         LAWYER
          Mark is your natural born son;
          isn't that correct?
          MRS. EVELYN WHITACRE isn't dead after all-- she's being
          deposed.

                         LAWYER
          According to the adoption story
          Mark told, his parents we're killed
          in a car accident. Is there any
          truth in that?

                         WHITACRE'S MOM

          He grew up in our house.

          consider yourself wealthy?

          Shepard.

                         D' ANGELO
          This is your chance to put
          everything on the table. This is
          the chance to redeem yourself, but
          if you're not going to be
          completely honest you should stop
          talking now.

                         WHITACRE
          I understand that. And I want to
          tell you I feel bad. I'm so sorry,
          and I feel worst about letting down
          Brian Shepard and Bob Herndon.
          Last time we talked I was under a
          great deal of stress and I said
          some things that weren't true. I'd
          like to clear that up.
          Whitacre is more earnest than ever before-- he begins.

          The first kickback was in 1992,
          Mick knew all about it, he told me
          there'd be plenty of opportunities

          Well, I think you did a real good

          Mark committed a crime. He stole
          nine million dollars. It's
          indefensible. But these guys from
          ADM stole hundreds of millions of
          dollars from innocent people all
          over the world. Mark showed you
          that four white guys in suits
          getting together in the middle of
          the day, isn't a business meeting.
          It's a crime scene. And not only
          did he tell you about it, he got
          you the evidence to prove it. Now,

          You've got to focus here. You
          stole nine million dollars. And

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          I read this study in Time magazine
          when I was at Cornell-- which is an
          Ivy league school-- and there were
          a lot of people who never believed,
          including my mother, that I would
          make it to an Ivy league school
          maybe just Ginger who I met in
          Marching Band in the 8th grade...

          ANGLE ON THE LETTER
          Fragments of the contents "This is to inform you of your
          lithium levels"..."Exacerbated by stress"..."A strict drug
          regimen..."

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          .and the study said that people
          had nice, sympathetic feelings
          about people who were adopted and
          treated them better. So I made up
          this adoption story-- and people
          did treat me better-- and when I
          got a job one of my professors told
          the people at Ralston Purina that I
          was this amazing guy that had
          accomplished all of this in spite
          of being adopted--
          Whitacre takes out a pair of SCISSORS and goes to work on the
          letter.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          .and so it was really other
          people who spread the story not me--
          although I admit it was wrong to
          start it and everything, it was
          other people who kept it going.
          Even the people at ADM.

          It's bigger than any of us, and
          it's ongoing. I know you're
          skeptical, but I've seen it. My
          client Mark Whitacre has shown it
          to me. Maybe I'm just a personal
          injury lawyer from Taylorville-

          Grandiosity and embellishment--

          embellish things-- those are the
          major symptoms of bipolar disorder.
          And the other, the second major
          symptom is poor judgement. And
          that's something Brian Shepard
          should have known ; The bipolar
          disorder is what made me believe
          I'd be President when it was
          over... Although there was a time
          when Mick told me, on a trip to
          Nebraska, that I could be headed
          for the top.

          187 INTERIOR FEDERAL COURT, URBANA ILLINOIS 187
          Whitacre looks like shit. He sits with Walker in JUDGE
          HAROLD BAKER'S courtroom.

          SUPER: OCTOBER, 10TH, 1997

                          CLERK
          Case 97-2001 United states of
           America versus Mark Whitacre.

                          JUDGE BAKER
          You have the right to make a
          statement if you wish?
          Whitacre nods and stands.

                         WHITACRE
          I appreciate the opportunity to say
          a few words, it's been a long five
          years. I apologize to a lot of
          people in this room...

          ANGLE ON SHEPARD AND HERNDON
          They sit together in the back row.

                         WHITACRE
          And to a lot of them who are not in
          this room for my actions. I
          realize I hurt a lot of people and
          I apologize greatly...I am here to
          accept my punishment. That's all.

                         JUDGE BAKER
          To observe that Mr. Whitacre is the
          usual felon is a gross
          understatement. He is well
          educated, has a loving wife and
          family, is respected in the
          community. It is not inconceivable
          that in due course he may have
          become CEO of Archer Daniels
          Midland...

          ANGLE ON WHITACRE
          He smiles. He knew he could be CEO someday. . .We hear
          Whitacre in a calmer time.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          I like jail. I think it's been good
          for me...
          But, the judge isn't done with him.

                         JUDGE BAKER
          However, the court can find no
          clear connection between Mr.
          Whitacre's bipolar disorder and the
          45 counts of criminal misconduct he
          has been charged with-- just garden
          variety greed. It is very
          difficult to tell when Mr. Whitacre
          is telling the truth...

          188 INTERIOR ANOTHER COURTROOM- DAY 188
          A larger courtroom. Mick and Terry stand for sentencing,
          surrounded by Aubrey Daniel and others.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          But, I don't think what happened is
          fair when you look at what happened
          to me compared to Mick and Terry. I
          mean, if you go and hold up your
          local grocery store you might get
          five years...

          Mick and Terry held up every
          grocery store in the world and they
          only got three... So you tell me how
          it makes sense that I get nine. I
          think that's something you should
          consider, Mr. President, when
          reviewing my request for pardon.

          189 INTERIOR FEDERAL CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION, SC- DAY 189
          Whitacre is in his green prison jumpsuit-- BALD-- his toupee,
          another deception, also gone. He sits in front of a video
          camera in the beam of ONE LIGHT. A CAMERAMAN records his

                         WHITACRE (CONT'D)
          I'd also like to take this
          opportunity to apologize to Special
          Agent Brian Shepard on behalf of
          myself and my wife Ginger, he never
          hit me with a brief case or told me
          to destroy tapes. The idea to sue
          him wasn't mine-- it came from
          someone at ADM and I shouldn't have
          listened. I can't remember who.
          when I was at ADM, I lived so many
          lives, I wasn't sure who I was.
          Today, I know more who I am and
          what I really want out of life.
          I've completed three post-graduate
          degrees while in detention. A J.D.
          which is, of course, a law degree
          and another advanced degree in the
          psychology of jury selection. I
          sleep better in prison than I have
          in years. My wife has forgiven me
          and believes that the ordeal with
          ADM has brought us closer together
          in a marriage of over 20 years. I
          hope you will allow me to leave
          here, so that I can re-join my life
          with my family and three kids. . .Two
          of whom are adopted... Especially
          when you consider that thanks in
          large part to my testimony the US
          government has been able to collect
          over a billion dollars in price-
          fixing fines from big business.
          That's it. Thanks.
          He smiles. The light goes out. The Cameraman starts packing
          up the equipment. Out of the shadows steps Bob Herndon.

                         HERNDON
          Good luck with the appeal, Mark.

                         WHITACRE
          Thanks for helping me remember
          everything Bob. I sure appreciate
          it. I wish Brian could've come.

                         HERNDON
          He still pretty angry.

                         WHITACRE
          You tell him, I'm real sorry. Can
          you do that for me? The funny part
          is if I'd never gone undercover I
          would have never stolen 11 million.
          It was my way out. My severance.
          What else could I do-- I wrote my
          own severance.

          Herndon does some math.

                         HERNDON
          11 million? I thought it came out
          to nine.

                         WHITACRE
          Did I say eleven? Boy, it was only
          nine. Definitely. The eleven is
          with interest.

                         HERNDON
          Mark, are you still taking your
          medication?

                         WHITACRE
          The doctor here says I don't need
          it anymore. I can manage without
          it now that there's less stress. It
          was just the stress of the FBI.
          Herndon turns to leave-- and then he pauses.

                         HERNDON
          Mark, was it eleven? I mean there
          isn't something else we need to...
