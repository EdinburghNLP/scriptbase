          1 ALLEY LOADING PLATFORM AND CORRIDOR OF FAIRMONT HOTEL

          NIGHT
          The story begins in this grubby alley, where two extra
          large ambulances screech to a stop beside a loading
          platform. Onlookers gather in the alley entrance to
          see how many people died; nobody died, the backdoors
          of the ambulances are opened by attendants, and six
          perfectly fine victims of perfectly terrible automobile
          accidents are lifted into wheelchairs.
          The cripples are beautifully dressed, the men in tuxedos,
          the women in splendid evening dresses. One of the women
          wears a neck brace which forces her always to look
          skyward, so she cantt see the beautiful orchid corsage
          pinned to her bosom.
          Quickly, attendants roll the wheelchairs past all the
          stacks of fruit and vegetables on the loading platform,
          past great bales of laundry, past whatever horrors one
          finds behind the warm, smiling face of a hotel. Watch-
          men, pastry cooks, valets are watching the rush of the
          wheelchairs without much interest.
          Then doors swing open, and we are in the tram It of the
          grand ballroom.

          2 INTO GRAND BALLROOM
          It is a charity ball. The sign says "Shake for Highway
          Safety."' The wheelchairs and their occupants no longer
          interest us. They are the guests of honor, and people
          gather about them to arrange them appealingly, and we
          rush past the go-go band, the shakers, and the door
          prize, which is a little convertible, spinning endlessly
          on a pedestal.
          CAMERA reaches PETULIA, who is dancing with her husband,
          DAVID, but trying not to lose sight of ARCHIE. ARCHIE
          really wants to leave, but he is too polite to make it
          too obvious. As he bends over to put his punch cup on
          a table, he is bumped by the wheelchair of one of the
          guests of honor. He is not at all comfortable.

          It's not easy for Petulia to keep an eye on Archie;
          gasping faces get in the ways hunks of twisting bodies
          get in the way, and the dance won't end. The music
          stops for a second, everyone sags and thinks, "Thank
          God it's over," but instantly the music begins again
          and everyone good naturedly swears, "Those crazy kids
          are trying to kill us," and meanwhile Petulia sees
          that Archie has reached the place where you get your
          coat.

          MED. ARCHIE
          He is searching through his pockets for the ticket
          that will let him reclaim his coat. All the coats
          are in an incredible piles and in the semi-hysterical
          care of a debutante attendant.

          PETULIA' S VOICE
          You can't leave
          He turns and sees Petulia.

          PETULIA
          You're an official host.
          She nods to the ribbon and cardboard which along with
          'Official Host' says Dr. A. Bollen. Archie takes the
          ribbon off, as though to pin it on Petulia.

          PETULIA
          Careful. Can you tell I'm not wearing
          a brassiere?

          ARCHIE
          No.

          PETULIA
          Don't think about it. It will only
          excite you.
          Archie finally finds the ticket for his coat, which the
          attendant now tries to find. On through this Petulia
          continues.

          Ahh ...

          PETULIA
          I've been married six months and I've
          never had an affair,

          ARCHIE
          It can happen

          PETULIA
          Don't take it so bloody well. I've just
          turned you down. He's looking at us.
          My husband,

          MED. DAVID WITH HIS MOTHER AND FATHER
          somewhere near the free whiskey table asking for Pernod,
          which, of course, they don't have.
          The father is watching the charity affair with utter
          disapproval. He tips a waiter by shoving a half-dozen
          raffle tickets into the waiter's jacket pocket,

          MR, DANNER
          I hope you win the car, sir,
          Mrs. Danner is charmed by her husband's generosity.
          She simply adores the man. David is busy not watching
          Archie and Petulia,

          PETULIA'S VOICE
          Isn't he gorgeous? He's a naval architect.
          It really zings when you say it. "My
          husband David is a naval architect."
          Actually, we're starving. You wouldn't
          want to buy a sixty foot sloop? David's
          "Momma"` and "Poppa' keep us. Look how
          disgusted Poppa is. He hates this sort
          of thing.

          Sensitive, my ass. He's bored. Highway
          safety's so blah. Also, he hates amateurs.
          Give him something he can sink his teeth
          into - "Rheumatoid Arthritis" Â® "Muscular
          Dystrophy"' -m and he's the best there is.
          A real pro. A little lame girl with a
          ribbon in her hair and a crutch under her
          arm, and Poppa can set the world on fire.
          He's really slumming tonight.

          BARNEY'S VOICE
          Hello, Archie.

          MED. PETULIA AND ARCHIE
          have been joined by BARNEY and WILMA, Archie's best
          friends. Barney and Wilma are taking off their coats.
          Barney is already beginning to move to the music.
          0 Wilma is doing absolutely nothing but looking at
          Petulia.

          WILMA
          Everybody came late.

          ARCHIE
          I came early. G'bye Wilma. G'bye

          Could you describe the coat?

          ARCHIE
          A. coat. A raincoat. Sleeves.
          Barney has begun to snap his fingers and move his shoulders,
          becoming part of "The Scene", about which Wilma couldn't
          care less.

          WILMA

          Alright, then. I won't tell you who
          I bumped into last week

          ARCHIE
          buying a well larded rib roast.

          WILMA
          Smarty. Have you seen what she's done
          to her hair?

          ARCHIE
          Wild, huh?

          WILMA
          I said, "Polo, for heaven's sake, you
          look like a teenager."
          Archie doesn't seem too interested and, besides, all
          this is said while Wilma continues to look at Petulia.

          Â€¢

          WILMA
          Your Mike's getting so fat. Is that
          much weight good for a boy his age?

          Barney suddenly forgets the music to rescue his Vicuna
          coat which the debutante is smothering under other
          coats as she finally finds Archie's.

          W ILMA
          (to Petulia)
          I don't believe we've met.

          Wilma moves off with Barney. Archie can't spend one
          more second with his coat. He simply puts it on, and
          turns to leave, walking toward the door.

          PETULIA
          My name is Petulia,

          ARCHIE
          Itm not surprised,

          PETULIA
          Polo's your wife,

          ARCHIE
          Ex-wife, G' night.
          Petulia turns to face her husband David, who has taken a few
          steps toward her. She whirls around to face the departing
          Archie.

          PETULIA
          Archie!
          He turns, almost at the door.

          There is something goofily desperate in her voice that
          stops him. He looks at her for awhile.

          Thank you, Archie. Damn it, how can I have an
          affair with an unmarried man. There has to be
          some equality of guilt.

          But in turning to do so she sees David, then the
          spinning car, the door prize.

          PETULIA

          ARCHIE
          What?

          PETULIA
          I've been told that I'll be the one to draw
          the winning ticket. I'm always picked for
          things like that. I radiate incorruptibility.
          Money can't buy me.
          She shakes her head, thoughtfully. During all this the door-
          man has been busily opening and closing the door for them as
          they keep changing their mind.

          PETULIA
          It feels so super. Suddenly, all that love.

          of a small boy, pinning him to the ground and people
          shocked, not knowing what to do.

          ARCHIE'S VOICE
          Well, stay then.

          PETULIA
          Archie, why do you play this dumb game?
          This crappy pretense at resisting the
          beautiful lady? You're bloody lucky I'm
          even talking to you. How many kids do
          you have besides fat Mike?

          G'night.

          Actually, only one besides Mike.

          PETULIA
          Meet you outside.

          5 EXT. DREAM MOTEL NIGHT

          A motel sign: "Dream Motel."' A concrete oval, spiral-
          ling up four floors. You drive to your room and everything
          is geared to get you to bed electronically. But you must
          have a car, and Petulia and Archie have come by cab.
          Archie is paying the cabbie.

          PETULIA
          (to cabbie)
          You mustn't take it personal.
          (she indicates the "No Cabs" sign)
          Lucky we don't have luggage.

          ARCHIE
          Does this trouble you?

          PETULIA

          I'd always imagined a tourist cabin, with

          Archie sees a car moving through the processes of
          E registration. Grabbing Petulia's hand, he starts to
          what is presumably the entrance -- at least it is the
          bottom of the ramp. They arrive at the booth and
          Archie steps on the. place marked 'Stand Here.' A
          T.V. screen lights up.

          MAN ON TV

          Archie nods for Petulia to see the T.V. camera which
          is scanning them.

          MAN ON TV
          No, ma'am. You got kids?

          PETULIA
          No, no. I was told to be suspicious of
          motels which cater to the family trade.

          MAN ON TV
          This isn't that sort of place. No auto.

          WELL
          There is a small sound and a gadget reaches out which
          normally would fasten to the side of the car. On it is
          an electronic register, an electronic pen and a key with
          a great metal tag (as an example of how this might be
          designed, I recommend visiting a drive-in bank in Los
          Angeles). As Archie registers, and puts the ten dollar
          bill where it belongs, Petulia looks at the T.V. set.

          MAN ON TV
          We've got an elevator but its just for going
          out for the paper and the like. I mean when
          you don't want to take the car. You'll have
          to use the ramp because of the key. It lets
          you know when you get to your room.

          INT. RAMP

          Archie and Petulia start up ramp.
          It's a long dark run and they are soon winded,

          But she is now totally winded and cannot say another
          word. Archie reacts to a sudden phenomena: a tiny
          light on the key in his hand starts flicking on and off
          furiously. Just ahead of him is the door of their motel
          room. Archie is aghast at the pulsating key.

          Stark is hardly the word but it will have to do. A
          control panel takes care of the drapes, T.V., stereo,
          announcements from the office, etc., etc., etc. There
          are mirrors everywhere and the first thing Petulia
          does is establish contact between the vanity mirror,
          the mirror on the bathroom door and the medicine cabinet
          mirror so that she is reflected endlessly.

          PETULIA
          You have 624 women in this room and
          I'm still counting.
          Archie moves behind her and begins unbuttoning the top
          buttons on the back of her dress.

          PETULIA

          (HARSHLY)
          Just wait a minute, okay?
          Archie plops on the bed in his coat, a most iropic smile
          on his face -- he is beginning to suspect he is not
          going to get laid. Petulia is examining all the Petulia
          faces in the mirrors.

          PETULIA
          My great-grandmother is ninety-one and
          still has a granite chin.
          Archie pushes a gadget beside the bed and it begins to
          vibrate. Petulia sees endless Archies vibrating on
          endless beds.

          PETULIA
          What a lecherous lot

          ARCHIE
          She's ninety-ones eh?

          PETULIA
          But no fun.

          ARCHIE
          Not at ninety-one, hell

          PETULIA
          She stopped having fun at twenty-eight when her
          husband was killed in the first war, in a
          trench looking just like Cary Grant with a
          waxed moustache. She can't remember him but
          she does remember Cary Grant because he is
          from Bristol, too, and often in the news. If
          his picture is in the paper he gets a waxed
          moustache whether he likes it or not.
          She turns to face Archie. She is afraid and she is
          angry and she doesn-t know quite what to do from one
          moment to the next. But she knows he shouldn't be in an
          overcoat jiggling on a jiggling bed,

          Â€¢

          PETULIA
          Stop being so damn casual.
          Archie sits up but is still casual,

          an instrument, Archie?

          ARCHIE

          Across from the ramp there is the elevator the man on
          T.V. mentioned. Archie is already there waiting for it
          to arrive. Petulia starts toward him angrily.

          PETULIA
          Where do you have to rush? If we were making
          love you would be exploring my navel about now.
          Time would be the last thing on your mind.
          An old man in a bathrobe, sadly out of contrast with
          the electronic motel, looks up from the open trunk of
          his car. The elevator doors open. Petulia and Archie
          enter,

          9 INT. ELEVATOR

          The elevator doors shut and inside the elevator a
          loud speaker begins playing a medley of San Francisco
          songs.

          PETULIA
          You. look like a gargoyle. Poor, dumb Archie.
          I'm all mixed up sexually. Old Mum's a
          prostitute. The oldest professional lady in
          0 all Bristol. Mavis, too, my sister. But
          I mean she's not a landmark yet.

          During this Archie notices that the back of Petulia's
          dress remains unbuttoned. He moves behind her and
          begins rebuttoning her. At the touch of his hand,
          something happens to Petulia.

          10 INT. FIRST AID ROOM

          Archie's hands are holding a little boy under the bright
          lights of a first aid table. The boy is a bloody mess but
          Archie's hands are soothing him even as they so gently
          prod, examining his injuries. Nurses are cutting the boy's
          bloody jeans off him, an expensive watch falls to the
          floor, they retrieve it.

          11 INT. ELEVATOR

          Petulia's head presses against Archie's hand. She
          kisses it, she rubs her cheek against it.
          The elevator has come to a stop and the doors have opened.
          Archie sees Petulia's tears on his hand.

          ARCHIE
          Real honest-to-God tears, Petulia?

          PETULIA
          Tears, Archie.

          0

          ARCHIE
          Petulia, you're a kook.
          He exits the elevator and whistles at a cruising cab.

          12 EXT. DREAM MOTEL

          Archie crosses to the cab and opens the door. He hustles
          Petulia inside the cab.

          ARCHIE
          If he gets you there in time, you can still
          pick the winning ticket and make somebody happy.

          PETULIA
          (very quietly)
          Archie, I'm going to marry you.
          The cab pulls away and Archie sees Petulia looking at him
          through the rear window. Archie allows himself the
          drollest of smiles.

          A jalopy full of dizzy dames with "LOVE" painted in
          huge awkward letters on its side almost runs him
          down. Archie continues in the night.
          Now, we can see the Golden Gate Bridge.

          13 EXT. DANNER HOUSE DAWN

          The house is on the edge of the sea and a cliff rises
          behind it. Petulia is going up the open lift which
          climbs the cliff. It is a very different Petulia.
          She hurts.

          INT. ARCHIE'S BEDROOM MORNING

          Archie is sleeping. There is the SOUND of a bell
          ringing. After awhile Archie's hand reaches out for
          the phone.

          ARCHIE
          (into phone)
          I'm up, thanks.
          Then his dizzy brain realizes the ringing is continuing
          and is constant. He sees the alarm clock, 6:1 He
          stumbles and staggers to the front door.

          ARCHIE
          Yeah... yeah 000 yeah 000
          He opens the door to come face to face with the large
          and twirly front end of a tuba. The tuba is stark
          white for no particular reason.

          14A EXT. ARCHIE'S APARTMENT

          We see some of the hall, a yawning milkman, etc., but
          mostly Petulia and the tuba.

          14B INT. ARCHIE'S APARTMENT

          Dazedly,.Archie steps back to make room for Petulia
          and the tuba.

          ARC HIE
          I'll make some coffee.
          Petulia blows with all her strength, emitting a sad
          little peep, then collapses to the floor, tuba and all.

          (at the same time)
          No, I've been up for hours, waiting for
          the doorbell to ring,

          A brick smashes the glass, scattering cameras, mandolins,
          etc. in the midst of which is the white tuba.

          PETULIA'S VOICE

          go off?

          He reaches to help Petulia to her feet but as he touches
          her waist to lift her, she screams and faints,

          15 INT. HALLWAY OF DANNER HOUSE NIGHT

          But we don't know it's the Danner house. All we see is
          Petulia crumpling as she is struck. She hits the floor
          and just lies there, not making a sound.
          (Also SHOOT in slow motion.)

          16 INT. ARCHIE' S APARTMENT

          Archie breaks an ammonia ampule under Petulia's nose.
          Her head wrenches away and she opens her eyes. Archie
          has begun to prod her side; she is in pain.

          PETULIA
          Hopping around with tubas and stuff --
          isntt it kooky, though?
          Archie has begun to remove her dress.

          PETULIA
          When are we going to stop trying to
          undress me?

          ARCHIE
          Shut up.

          As a woman, not as a rib.
          Archie is harassed. The phone begins ringing. He grabs
          it angrily.

          ARCHIE
          (into phone)
          I'm awake! I'm awake; How many times

          He sighs. and begins dialing a number. Petulia is in real
          pain. Like a,little child she crawls under the covers of
          his bed, pulling the quilt up around her as though Archie's
          left over warmth will make the pain go away.

          ARCHIE

          it's very complicated and I haven't had
          my morning coffee yet. Her name is Petulia.
          I don't know her last name, Barney. Yes,
          Petulia. Barney, shut up. I have to get
          to the hospital.

          16A BARNEY'S BEDROOM MORNING
          During the above we catch a glimpse of sleepy Barney
          sleepily asking stupid questions.

          16B INT. ARCHIE'S APARTMENT

          Archie hangs up, goes to a medicine case which he had
          hastily opened for the ammonia ampule and now he takes out
          a couple of pills, which he gives to Petulia,. She takes
          them obediently,

          PETULIA
          You've got a super build for a man your age.
          Archie says nothing. He crosses to the bathroom and
          hastily begins dressing.

          PETULIA
          Where are all the family pictures?
          Archie is busy brushing his teeth,

          Archie exits from the bathroom, all the time continuing
          to dress,

          PETULIA
          WhatÂ°s her real name?

          ARCHIE
          Prudence.

          PETULIA
          And you named her Polo. That's kind
          of sickening, Archie.
          Archie stops his dressing long enough to gaze at this girl
          in his bed, beyond which is an overturned tuba. Archie
          sighs somewhat philosophically, not nearly as amused as
          you'd think.

          17 INT. HOSPITAL

          We are in the examining room of the orthopedic ward.
          Archie is working on Oliver, the little Mexican boy of

          Â€¢
          seven whom we have seen earlier as a bloody mess in the
          flashback. Now, Oliver is healing nicely, but it's still
          not pleasant to be examined. A woman hovers in the back-
          ground. A nurse assists Archie. Oliver is a brave, solemn
          little boy, with shadows of fatigue around his eyes. He
          is also a tough little bastard, let me tell you. He is
          now wearing the broken gold watch; though to fit his
          skinny wrist the band has been tied in a knot,

          ARCHIE
          I want him here every day. For therapy.

          WOMAN
          Si, Yes, doctor. I do,
          Oliver speaks only a few words of English, mostly the
          necessary scatological and sexual phrases that would be
          necessary in his line of business.

          ARCHIE
          Every day. Tell him that.
          The woman says it to Oliver in Spanish. Oliver says
          something obviously obscene.

          You're not well, just better.
          (to woman)
          Say that.
          The woman tells Oliver in Spanish as Archie continues
          examining the leg.

          ARCHIE
          Sorry, pal.
          Oliver says something in Spanish.

          Shame.
          Archie realizes Oliver is in great pain and close to tears.
          He stops the examination and rubs his hand gently through
          the kid's hair,

          ARCHIE
          Every day. Same time. Two o'clock,
          right on the dot.

          down a big brass pole in the centre of the room. As the
          scene begins Barney is alone, morosely munching a corned
          beef sandwich. Now Archie appears, threading his way
          through topless fashion show. A topless ANNOUNCER is

          You tell me.

          Oh, great, terrific, you wouldn't
          believe it. Terrific. And her rib?

          BARNEY
          I taped it. Gave her some seconal.

          He is eating a corned beef sandwich. Archie is ordering
          the same.

          BARNEY
          She said you beat her up. Kidding,
          of course.
          Archie bites into his sandwich with small enthusiasm.
          Breasts with their pasties always intrude.

          So I have a right to my opinion; It's
          breaking Wilma's heart; That's all we
          talk about. You think you're different
          than anybody else? Every time I leave my

          back. You're not listening to me, Archie.

          20 INT. HOSPITAL

          The left side of a patient's face and the right shoulder
          and arm of the patient's body are sprayed with a special
          liquid which instantly dries a violent blue and then very
          quickly starts changing into all the colors of the rainbow.
          These various colors indicate physical conditions. They
          are watched, measured, and timed by Archie, Barney and
          their assistants,

          BARNEY'S VOICE
          My record is far from spotless, if you
          don't know that, who does? But baby, it's
          just not the answer, not at our age.

          a marvellous looking couple.

          21 INT. HOSPITAL LEAD ROOM

          The patient is in a lead room being scanned by an atomic
          computer. The activator moves in a rhythmic, graceful
          pattern over the patient's drab, withered body. In the
          control area Archie and Barney listen to the strange sounds
          emanating from the computer, each sound again indicating a
          physical condition. The patient's room looks like a comfy
          hotel room: wood paneling, couches, magazines, plants.
          The door leading to outside is three inches thick and
          solid lead. The noise from the equipment is deafening.

          22 INT. A DECOMPRESSION OPERATING ROOM

          This is a really glorified pressure chamber where a complete
          atmosphere is created to suit whatever surgery is going on.
          The patient can no longer be seen. He is draped in plastic
          which creates a sub-atmosphere. The doctors and nurses
          are swathed in plastic, again in the atmosphere that lets
          them function best, (This is for real. It exists, for
          instance, at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York.) The doctors
          and nurses communicate with each other through throat
          mikes and seem like other world automatons. In all this
          the patient simply does not exist. The colors are eerie
          yellows and blues with only occasionally and very
          impersonally the red of blood,

          It's still better than being out there in

          Nobody has a life anymore. Quicksand,
          It scares me. What do you want, Archie?

          entrance, when he sees Petulia sitting on a bus-stop
          bench, the tuba beside her. She is dozing.

          ARCHIE

          (SOFTLY)
          Hey, you.
          She opens her eyes, smiles.

          How'm I prying?

          PETULIA
          I'll go home by bus.

          ARCHIE
          If I were prying, I would ask you how you
          broke your rib. Right?

          PE TULIA
          You fall on a tuba and you break your
          rib. Right.

          ARCHIE
          Wrong. The rib was broken hours before
          your fall.
          L' During this the bus comes to a stop. Petulia rises shakily
          to board it but she can't go through the entrance with
          the tuba.

          Petulia takes a seat at an open window. The bus is now
          stopped for a moment more by the traffic light. Petulia,
          under the best of circumstances doesn't make much sense,
          and now she's quite groggy.

          PETULIA
          Will you remember that? "Friends of
          the Evergreen."

          organization, founded in 1886 for the betterment of man,
          but the door is securely padlocked for the night.
          Archie stands there, holding the tuba and feeling
          stupid. Haplessly, he returns to his car and begins
          stowing the tuba inside, banging it against his nose
          in the process. He is a far from happy man.

          29 EXT./INT. A CLUTTERED, MEAN LITTLE KITCIEN


           IN A SLUM HOUSE DAY
          Petulia is filling the noisy old electric ice box with
          milk, ice cream and fresh fruit. A man enters from
          another room. He is a big, sleepy-eyed Mexican. He
          has just awakened, is wearing his pajama bottoms and
          is hairy, sweaty and fat.
          Petulia obviously knows tlleiman, nods hello, to which
          the man answers a non-committal grunt. He squeezes
          past Petulia to drink from the sink. He sticks his
          head under the tap.

          milk and things.
          He finds the situation amusing, reaching in past Petulia
          to grab an orange. There should be a feeling of a
          possible relationship between Petulia and this man.
          In the next room a screen door opens and closes.
          Petulia closes the ice box door and we and she see
          Oliver and the Woman standing in the doorway.

          Archie is doing research at a desk. Working from notes,
          he is talking into a tape recorder about new techniques
          in the treatment of arthritis that would not require
          surgery. This is a moment to glimpse Archie as a
          thoughtful man. There are a couple of beer bottles
          nearby. The bed is still unmade. The tuba stands
          in the corner.

          Archie's sad, too, therefore he is more brusque than
          necessary. Also he is bugged by the cookies.

          ARCHIE
          You need anything, Polo?

          Polo laughs, suddenly they share a moment of warmth.

          POLO
          It's such a puzzle. We really got on
          so marvelously. Never fought. Never
          screamed at each other. Not once.
          â€¢ Something in his silence, plus that damned unmade bed,
          is beginning to make her angry.

          Everybody we knew envied us.

          We were a handsome couple.
          This makes her so angry she can now say what she came
          to say.

          POLO
          I think I've fallen in love. The
          man is Warren Smith. He's an engineer
          and very good with the children, but he
          wants to go back to school and get his

          POLO
          Not right away. He's also divorced.
          There's alimony ... child support
          It looks absolutely obscene.

          Archie sees her. looking at his bed.

          So the kids like him, eh?

          POLO
          Adore him.

          ARCHIE
          How about that?

          POLO
          Don't you have maid service?

          ARCHIE

          (SUDDENLY)
          What the hell are you doing, bringing
          me cookies?
          He flings the bag at her, barely missing her. They
          are both stunned by this outburst,

           Well ... this is a new side of your
          natured For two people who never fight
          Absently, Polo sags down on the edge of the unmade bed,
          which has so fascinated her. During the following, no
          matter what their bodies happen to be doing, Polo and
          Archie continue to speak in a most logical manner.

          ARCHIE
          What's so great about not fighting?

          POLO
          I came to tell you about Warren,

          ARCHIE
          You told me about Warren.
          He sits beside her, well not really beside her, actually
          as far away from her as the bed will permit. She decides
          she will instantly get up off the bed, but she does not.

          ARCHIE

          (CONTINUING)
          Warren is working for his m'tstah's
          in hydraulics.

          Polo knows she shouldn't smile at Archie making fun of
          Warren, but she does. Archie touches her smile with his
          finger, then his hand moves across her face, to the back
          of her neck. It is a clumsy gesture and they clumsily
          sprawl on the bed.

          POLO
          Well, I'm afraid well still need
          all the money you pay me. And I'll

          By now, entirely out of habit, Archie's hand has
          pushed up Polo's shirt, as he continues the sex ritual.
          Wholly out of habit, Polo lets him. Their bodies, old
          friends for so long, and once having been lovers,
          simply ignore whatever tripe their mouths happen to
          be saying,

          If he's a bright guy, he'll make out okay.

          POLO
          Needless to say there are certain problems.
          By now, Archie is on top of Polo, and out of habit she
          is adjusting her body for him.

          ARCHIE
          Poor Polo.

          POLO
          It's such an icky little room.
          Archie is, perhaps, two seconds away from entering Polo,
          when he suddenly sits up, wondering what the hell he's
          been doing. He walks to the far side of the room,
          sticks his shirt in, wipes the sleeve of his shirt
          across his face.
          Polo feels no particular rancor, the entire thing was
          totally unplanned, and she has no more desire to
          "make it" with Archie than he has with her. She pulls
          down her skirt and adjusts her garters.

          ARCHIE
          Tell the kids I'll come for them
          0 Sunday at eight.

          They'll be ready. I thought the
          decent thing was to come here and
          talk in a civilized manner. About
          the change in my situation.

          ARCHIE
          I appreciate it, Polo.

          POLO
          Good night, Archie.

          ARCHIE
          You've got a run in your stocking.
          Polo exits, Archie can't figure out why in the world
          he even thought of making love to Polo after all this
          time. He sits down on the unmade bed, finds one of
          Polo's cookies on the sheets, and pops it into his
          mouth.

          been sitting on the grass. Gracefully she rises to

          rubber mannequins .. I've never once
          seen the pipe sticking out of their
          bottoms. Not once, not one damn time.
          That bothers me, May.
          May stops. She doesn1t know whether to be annoyed or
          amused. Shets a little of both.

          ARCHIE
          I'm not hostile, it's frustration.
          In all that perfection, how could a
          clumsy clot like me possibly be
          fitted in? I mean, without spoiling
          the whole effect.
          They have now reached the area of the stunted trees.
          Nuns are passing through empty benches; kids are
          improvising on the stage and shouting.

          when she is not "on," there are moments when Petulia seems
          utterly forlorn. This is such a moment. But then she sees

          She said there was this elderly lady whose
          first husband used to play tuba with John
          Phillip Sousa. She said it would cheer
          her up and make her want to live. She

          But Petulia just sits on the edge of a chair tapping
          her fingers in annoyance. Mr. Howard leaves. The door
          remains open for Petulia to leave. May watches Petulia
          in amused tolerance.

          Archie, when you try to sound cool and
          "with it," you're really pathetic.
          We're trying to have an intelligent
          conversation...

          ARCHIE

          PETULIA
          Well, about Polo, among other things.

          ARCHIE
          Polo is none of your damned business.

          PETULIA
          That's dumb. Dumb. She's my business
          and she's this lady's business. I
          happen to hate Polo.

          May looks at Archie in bewilderment, she is not quite sure
          how to react; but when she makes up her mind it will be
          the exactly right reaction. Also, in all truth, Petulia
          is frightened by May.

          and see beyond the kookiness, so for an instant we see
          beyond Archie's look of professional assurance and see
          the fearful uncertainty. He now moves into the corridor,
          with each step assuming the doctor's look that is expected
          of him.

          PETULIA'S VOICE
          Hi.
          Archie turns. Petulia is in the medical library with
          books scattered all about her.

          ARCHIE
          You're kidding.

          PETULIA
          I think I've discovered a cure for cancer.

          ARCHIE
          Well, if you're on the brink of something.
          How did they let you in.

          Â€¢
          She joins him.

          PETULIA
          You look exhausted.

          ARCHIE
          Do you know it's almost three? Doesn't
          Mr. Danner worry at all about things like that?
          Petulia looks at him reverently.

          PETULIA

          (TENDERLY)
          Look at you.
          Archie is so unaccustomed to hearing a straight line
          from Petulia that her tone and look of tenderness stop
          him for a moment. Then, without a word, they fall into
          step beside each other, leaving the hospital.

          37 EXT. PARKING LOT NIGHT

          At this time of night hardly a car remains. Archie's car
          is quite by itself.

          Shall I drop you off?
          (she doesn't answer)
          It's too late for the bus.
          She gets in.

          38 INT . CAR

          ARCHIE
          Petulia, you've got to stop following
          me around like this.
          Petulia is absolutely silent but her eyes are devouring
          him with infinite tenderness which Archie is finding
          very touching. It is a facet of Petulia he has never
          seen before.

          ARCHIE
          Where to? I could use a steak sandwich.
          There's a jazz joint that stays open
          all night.
          He reaches to start the car just as she grabs at him,
          â€¢ awkwardly, aggressively.

          ARCHIE

          (SURPRISED)
          Hey, come on Â®m why this sudden
          Petulia is relentless and voracious. Her hands and mouth
          are everywhere on Archie. A car is a lousy bedroom but
          it will have to do. Heads bump against windows, elbows
          jam against steering wheels, but Petulia will not be
          stopped. Finally, Archie grips her shoulders and forces
          her to stop.

          ARCHIE
          No.

          PETULIA
          Yes.

          ARC HIE
          Not here.

          39 INT. SUPERMARKET PRE-DAWN

          Though the streets outside are deserted, the supermarket
          is jammed with people. Archie is pushing a market
          â€¢ basket already piled high with groceries while Petulia
          keeps finding things to buy. Archie knows that Petulia
          is going through this massive shopping spree simply to
          get even for his rejection of the moment she chose to
          make love.

          I'm starving.

          ARCHIE
          Am I being punished?

          PETULIA
          Loganberry jam ... we'll have a case.

          ARCHIE
          I'd rather have a new plastic raincoat.

          PETULIA
          You don't save anything on plastic raincoats.

          ARCHIE
          Shall I get another cart? Polo can fill
          three or four when she really puts her
          mind to it.
          Petulia gets the point and instantly takes her place

          in the long line before the cashier.

          WOMAN SHOPPER

          You know what time it is? It's after fivB.

          PETULIA
          Ilia sorry.

          WOMAN SHOPPER
          I want to go to bed.

          PETULIA
          So do we.

          40 EXT. SUPERMARKET

          Petulia and Archie leave the supermarket with their rolling
          basket of groceries. There is no one else on the street.
          In front of the market is a clown on a pedestal gesticu-
          lating with arms and mouth at people who are not there,
          but making no sound. Petulia quizzically looks up at the
          silent violent clown, while Archie waits for her at the
          car. Finally he taps the horn and she turns and looks at
          him. She starts running toward the car, suddenly wanting
          0 very much to be with him. They kiss lightly.

          9 41 INT. ARCHIE'S BEDROOM NIGH'

          Archie is sound asleep, breathing heavily. Petulia sits
          wrapped in a blanket on the floor near the window, her
          head resting on the sill, lonely.

          42 TNT. ARCHIE'S BEDROOM NIGHT
          Petulia is sound asleep. Through the open bedroom door
          we see Archie drinking a lonesome Coke.

          43 INT. ARCHIES BEDROOM NIGHT

          Petulia and Archie are both in the bed, asleep and
          somehow as far apart as two human beings can be.

          44 INT. ARCHIE'S BEDROOM NIGHT

          In the midst of her sleep, Petulia begins jabbering in
          some language all her own. Archie Is eyes open and he
          looks at her and he smiles. Still sound asleep,
          Petulia finishes her statement, whatever the hell it
          was and settles down on the pillow. Archie looks at her.
          She wakes up. They look at each other so gravely that
          they both begin to smile. Neither one is having the
          best night of their life but both are aware of a sense
          â€¢ of tenderness that has caught them unexpectedly.
          45 INT. ARCHIEtS BEDROOM MORNING
          Petulia wakes up suddenly. Though she is nude under the
          sheets, Archie is fully dressed for his day with the
          boys. Though his clothes are very sporty he looks
          anything but sporty as he talks quietly into the phone-

          ARCHIE
          (into phone)
          Okay. Wells why not do some slides anyhow?
          (in sudden anger)
          To satisfy myself, that's who. Okay.
          He hangs up the phone and sees Petulia looking at him.

          ARCHIE
          Well, we knocked off another one. Another
          notch in the old stethoscope.

          PETULIA
          You're a wonderful doctor, Archie.

          ARCHIE
          I keep a little black bow tie in my desk. In
          0 case the services are in the morning and 1 have
          no time to go home. The neekband's all stained
          with sweat.

          PETULIA
          You're not abandoning me? I mean, I wasn't
          all that bad, was I?

          ARCH IE
          Amateur night,
          He leans over and kisses her mouth.

          PETULIA
          Before I've brushed my teeth? Are you a
          communist, Archie?

          ARCHIE
          I guess so

          PETULIA
          Tell Mike to watch that weight.

          Archie starts out, then stops, troubled.

          Yes?

          ARCHIE

          WELL

          PETULIA
          Write the Number down so you won't forget.
          Archie grins, sighs, and starts out. Petulia will do
          anything to hold him one second more.

          PETULIA
          Hey,, you.
          Archie turns at the door.

          PETULIA
          Don't have any illusions about all those
          groceries. I can't cook.

          ARCHIE
          And you hate loganberry Jam.

          PETULIA
          No, as a matter of fact, I rather like it.
          He smiles, continues out.

          46 EXT. CORRIDOR & STEPS OUTSIDE ARCHIE'S APT.

          He has barely gone ten steps when he is stopped by a
          whistle. He turns. Her head is popped out the door (or
          window). Anything to hold him, anything.

          PETULIA
          If somebody calls and wants medical advice on
          something really obscure, is it okay if I
          wing it on my own?
          He makes an amused "you nuts" gesture and leaves, but
          not before Petulia says:

          PETULIA

          He is gone.

          next to the ramp that leads to the boat. The boys are
          yelling to Dad to come ono

          ARCHIE

          Hi,

          During this series of dumb, ordinary telephone conversa-

          Â€¢
          tions to follow,, we begin seeing the moments which have
          brought on Petulia's current crisis with Oliver.

          48 INT. BULL RING TIJUANA

          It's a hot summer afternoon. Petulia and David have
          driven down from San Francisco. They are members of the
          "San Francisco Matador Club". David has drunk too much
          wine from his bota bag and the sour wine and the hot sun
          have made him violently ill. Though there are still two
          bulls left to kill, David and Petulia are leaving. As she
          moves down the spindly stairway, Petulia becomes aware of
          Oliver. He is with a gang of other kids at the butcher
          shed where the previous bulls are being dressed for market.
          They are all soaking banderillos in blood so they can be
          sold as "the real thing" .

          49 EXT. A STREET IN TIJUANA

          Petulia and David in their convertible. David has passed
          out in the back seat and Petulia is having a hell of a
          time trying to move the car out of the parking space.
          Again kids swarm about her like wild animals, trying to
          sell hats, cushions, gum, pottery, etc. Again she sees
          Oliver among them (or is it another kid who looks like
          0 Oliver?) ,

          

          

          

          

          50

          40 50 EXT. BORDER GATE AT TIJUANA LATE AFTERNOON

          Thousands of cars are waiting to get through. Hot, noisy,
          dusty, unbearable. Kids storm every car, hustling their
          captured audience. Among them is Oliver. Have the others
          been Oliver? In Petulia's exhaustion and discomfort, the
          heat, the flies, the blaring horny she can't be sure.
          (NOTE, All through the Tijuana scenes, we HEAR Archie
          and Petulia's telephone conversation. It is utterly banal
          and they know it and are amused by its banality.)
          PETULIA: I was dozing.
          ARCHIE: That's good.
          PETULIA: You left without having breakfast.
          ARCHIE: I had a cup of coffee on the way.
          PETULIA: A cup of coffee. You should have had
          eggs or waffles.
          ARCHIE: I'm fine.
          PETULIA: Me too.

          PAUSE
          PETULIA: I had a tall glass of pineapple juice.
          ARCHIE: Make some toast, too. And milk.
          Breakfast is a very important meal.
          PETULIA: I wish you'd remember that.
          ARCHIE: Well, goodbye.
          0 PETULIA: Archie?
          ARCHIE: Yes?
          PETULIA: You won't forget to phone.

          51 EXT. WHARF

          Archie hangs up the phone and starts running with his sons
          toward the boat. He is very pleased with his absolutely
          nothing phone conversation.

          52 EXT. BOAT DECK

          Children run scurrying around the mildly crowded deck.
          The boat is passing Alcatraz Island. Archie and the boys
          are standing at the rail,

          ARCHIE
          They used to think that escape from that
          prison was impossible.

          52A EXT. BOAT DECK

          Same scene, different Sunday. Warren and the boys are
          standing at the rail.

          WARREN
          They used to think that escape from that
          prison was impossible.

          MIKE
          Yes, Dad. Warren told us that last week.

          ARCHIE
          Warren. Well, we could have gone somewhere
          else. I didn't know you had been.

          STEVIE
          (the youngest)
          We thought maybe you had never been, Dad.

          ARCHIE
          No - well, thanks, actually I haven't
          been before, Stevie.

          MIKE
          In fact, we don't call him Stevie anymore.

          ARCHIE
          Who doesn't?

          MIKE
          Mom thinks he's getting a little old for
          being called Stevie, in fact.

          Â€¢

          ARCHIE
          I called you Stevie two weeks ago -e we were all
          calling you Stevie two weeks ago -- I was.

          STEVIE
          Before that.

          MIKE
          Warren says that Alcatraz taught the world you
          can get out of anything if you want to bad
          enough.

          ARCHIE
          That's what Warren said, eh?

          MIKE
          Yes, Dad.

          53 ANOTHER VIEW OF THE BOAT
          The boys are watching Archie who is in that section of the
          boat where the radar and electronic equipment are kept.
          Archie is on the ship telephone. He is trying to keep
          a straight face but since he is obviously talking to Petulia,
          it is difficult.

          â€¢ MIKE :
          (to another kid)
          Doctors can do things like that. Call
          their patients from wherever they are.
          Archie finishes the call and returns to them, smiling.

          

          

          

          

          52

          53 CONTINUED

          ARCHIE
          How about clams on the wharf when we get back?

          MIKE
          Clams make Steve vomit.

          ARCHIE
          Oh.

          MIKE
          You forgot that.

          ARCHIE
          No, it just slipped my mind.
          Archie really does like his kids but his thoughts are
          somewhere else.

          54 INT. A FISH PLACE ON THE WHARF

          While Mike and Stevie are gorging themselves, Archie
          is at the wall telephone.

          ARCHIE
          â€¢ Hello there.

          LATE AFTERNOON

          55 EXT. THE BORDER GATE AT TIJUANA

          During this silent scene we watch Oliver seduce Petulia
          into giving him a lift in her convertible. Petulia is
          so bored as the cars take hours to get past the gate,
          Oliver is an absolute scoundrel. David is such a clod,
          passing out in the back seat, his legs hanging out over
          the door of the car, one sandal missing. His beautiful
          face is somehow an obscene parody of itself, fiery
          red from the sun.
          Oliver mimics David, Petulia, the guard at the gate,
          dances, skips, romps, annoys Petulia, makes her laugh,
          dares her, goads her. Finally, when Petulia's car is
          just one away from the border guard, Oliver impudently
          hops into the seat beside her, expecting to be thrown
          out but also expecting maybe a nickel in the bargain.
          But the joke's on Oliver. Petulia is even kookier than
          he is. Is it the look of David that sickens her? Is
          it her annoyance at having to wait so long and do the
          driving while he lies collapsed and useless? Is it
          that "useless" that goads her?

          

          

          

          

          53

          55 CONTINUED
          Most of all Petulia is doing something of absolutely no
          importance; she knows Oliver will hop out of the car the
          moment they reach the guard. All it amounts to is two
          kooks having a few seconds of horsing around.
          The joke is on both of them -- the guard, harassed by
          the honking of thousands of cars and having fully
          inspected the car just ahead of Petulia, waves the
          convertible on through.
          Petulia stops the car a few hundred yards past the
          border to let Oliver climb out, but he just sits there.
          Petulia thinks, "okay, you little bastard . " and
          zooms down the highway, intending to stop at the first
          moment the look of superior arrogance leaves Oliver's
          tough little face.
          During this we hear Archie and Petulia's second tele-
          phone conversation which is as blab and loving as before.
          ARCHIE: Hi, there.
          PETULIA: Hello.
          ARCHIE: I'm having lunch with the boys.
          PETULIA: You eat a good lunch, Archie,
          ARCHIE: I will, I will.
           PETULIA: You only had a cup of coffee for breakfast.
          ARCHIE: I'll eat a good lunch, Petulia.
          PETULIA: Like what?
          ARCHIE: Petulia, they have a thousand different
           things on the menu.
          PETULIA: You should have a sirloin steak with french
          fries or baked beans.
          ARCHIE: Okay.
          PETULIA: That's easy to say, Archie, But I know you.
          ARCHIE: Steak with french fries or baked beans.
          PETULIA: Do they have fresh sea-food?
          ARCHIE: Yes.
          PETULIA: Sea bass is nice.
          ARCHIE: Yes, sea bass is great.
          PETULIA: If they grill it,
          ARCHIE: I'll have grilled sea bass.
          PETULIA: Unless they do a nice omelet.
          ARCHIE: I'm sure they would if I asked.
          PETULIA: It's such a problem.
          ARCHIE: Yes, I know. Goodbye, Petulia.
          PETULIA: Phone.

          Archie chases them through the floors.
          Archie sees a telephone above which is a sign which
          says that this phone is for the military and is to be
          used only in emergency. Archie approaches it warily,
          then loses his nerve and turns back to his kids.
          Archie wants to get back to Petulia.

          59 INT. ARCHIE'S APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY DAY

          Archie has had a pretty good day with the boys, is thinking
          â€¢ about Petulia waiting in his apartment, and feels pretty
          damn good about the whole thing. He opens the door of
          his apartment. He is carrying a bag of Mexican paper flowers

          60 INT. APARTMENT

          It is empty. Archie knows at once that Petulia is gone.
          All the joy goes out of him. The apartment is a mess.
          The television set is on: a program without sound of
          soldiers fighting. Archie is so disappointed that
          Petulia isn't here. He angrily flips the dial getting
          the same type of program.

          ARCHIE
          A nice, neat kid.
          After all the exuberance he feels so empty. Everywhere
          things are scattered about.

          61 INT. BEDROOM

          The bedroom is the worst of all. The sheets and blanket
          have literally been stripped from the bed and flung pall
          mall onto the floor behind. Archie really is annoyed.
          Then he stops, he crosses slowly to the tangle of sheets
          and blanket on the floor. A lifeless arm protrudes.
          Archie crumples to his knees and tears at the blankets.
          Petulia is broken, bloodied and seemingly dead.

          

          

          

          

          57

          61 CONTINUED
          Thï¿½-, phone is off the hook. Archie doesn't know where to
          turn first. He feels Petulia's throat for a pulse, isn't
          sure she has one,
          Petulia is wearing his hooded sweatshirt from Se. 23.
          Archie attempts heart massage, but Petuliats so taped up
          from the broken rib that this is impossible.
          Archie presses his mouth over Petulia's to attempt to get
          her breathing again. He tries this only for an instant
          then crosses to the phone, hangs it up and dials an
          emergency number.
          Archie goes back to Petulia. He feels again for a pulse
          in her throat, can find no pulse. He begins trembling.
          As always when a crisis really happens, it isn't as easy
          as the Red Cross advertisements say. Her mouth won't
          open right. His mouth seems unable to make the connection
          with hers. It all looks more like very bad love-making
          than a life-saving procedure.

          62 INT./EXT. HALLWAY & STEPS OUTSIDE ARCH IE' S APARTMENT

           Two special officers are moving Petulia down a hallway on

          0
          a stretcher. A third walks behind her pressing a rubber
          oxygen mask over her mouth.
          We feel Sunday late afternoon rudely shattered, but limp-
          ing along nevertheless. Television, cokes, sex, stereo,
          facials, isometric exercises. funny-papers, ailments;
          boring endless Sunday late afternoon -- suddenly bloodied.
          Doors are opening up and down the hallway. People come
          out to stare. A big friendly old sheepdog wild with
          enthusiasm, leaps at the stretcher and almost topples
          Petulia. Archie, smeared with Petulia's blood, his
          shirt-tails out, in a state of shock himself, whams the
          dog as hard as he can. This entire sequence should
          seem like a nightmare.
          The dog's owner goes berserk.

          DOG'S OWNER
          Don't you hit Lennie!
          Archie is too distressed about Petulia to even respond.
          At every door there is a tenant. A jumble of voices all
          spoken together.

          1ST TENANT
          0 That's sex for you.

          2ND TENANT
          It could be a gas leak.

          4TH TENANT
          Those rescue cops never give up.

          5TH TENANT
          Yes'. but they're all racists.
          Of course, one of the officers is a Korean and the other
          a Negro. All through this we have also been aware of many
          T.V. sets, all with programs with various kinds of violence.
          One youbgster comes to the door holding a portable T.V. and
          we see on the tube war casualties being flown out of the
          Jungle by helicopters.
          Archie has crossed ahead of the special officers to lead
          the way down the steps. Half a dozen "hippies"' loaded
          down with Chinese food and a yellow guitar are coming up
          the steps. Everything is chaos.
          The officers just can't manage the stretcher down the
          narrow stairway. Poor Petulia is twisted and turned every
          which way - all in the name of saving her life.

          7TH TENANT

          Â€¢
          (a rich old queen in
          purple Bermuda shorts)
          I had trouble like that with my piano. Two
          hundred dollars to bring it through the window.
          And its never been the same.
          A record player is playing a Herb Alpert recording and
          the stretcher seems to move along to its rhythm.

          63 EXT. A HIGHWAY RESTAURANT NIGHT

           This is the stretch of highway 1 - 01 going north from.Mexico.
          The restaurant is a mass of neon, and does very well in,the
          hot coffee department as the sleepy travellers take a
          break on their way north.
          Among the cars many are filled with bull fight
          afficianados.
          It's about ten p.m. There is a general feeling of
          exhaustion and spent passions. People are bleary-eyed,
          recovering from hangovers, beginning to feel the effects
          of sunburns. All this we see later. First we see Oliver.
          Oliver is sitting in the car staring coldly at David who
          0 has just awakened. David is probably just about to say
          "Who the hell are you" when Petulia appears carrying a
          cardboard carton of coffee and orange juice.

          David takes a sip of coffee. Oliver grabs at the orange
          juice, toppling it, spilling some of it on the seat but
          saving most. He gulps it down then uses the straw to
          make bubbles. David looks at Oliver and then at
          Petulia, all through the bubbles.

          PETULIA
          Say hello to "Petulia"s Folly."
          David says nothing.

          DAVID
          Oh?

          PET ULIA
          (with careful wit)
          If, in the past, you thought me a bit odd,
          feast your eyes on this little goodie.

          WhatÂ°s the problem?

          Why can't you speak English?

          What's your name?

          PETULIA
          I've got a name for him!
          Oliver doesn't understand what is being said, but he is
          getting uneasy.

          Actually the feeling should be that they're as relaxed
          as if they were mechanics working on a motor car.
          Archie sits on a white stool in a corner, watching

          67 INT. INTENSE CARE UNIT DAWN

          Archie is in Petulia's little cubicle slumped on a
          chair, sound asleep. Petulia lies on the bed, tubes
          protruding from arms and neck. She is still unconscious.
          Archie is awakened by a nun entering the cubicle to
          hook up another pint of blood. Archie's presence
          disconcerts the nun. She can't show her annoyance
          openly, but is so disturbed she does her work badly
          this time.

          NUN
          Who would do such a thing to a girl like
          this? She's a child. Is there an
          orthopaedic problem, Dr. Bollen?

          Archie doesn't answer.

          The nun would like to scream at Archie about the
          impropriety of his presence here but she can't.
          She is proud of the bottle of blood.

          NUN
          It would be such a nice surprise to have his
          picture here when she finally awakens.

          She leaves. Archie moves closer to Petulia examining
          her throat and eyes for vital signs. He pushes open an
          eyelid and Petulia's dead eye stares glassily into his
          living face.

          68 INT. HOSPITAL DAY

          We spend awhile watching Archie function as a doctor,
          moving through the wards, examining broken legs, arms,
          or whatever. In one of these scenes we pass through
          the orthopaedic room.

          69 INT. ORTHOPAEDIC ROOM

          Oliver is being given therapy in a whirling bath. He's
          only one of some twenty patients and Archie barely
          notices him, simply waving to him as he does to other
          patients who don't need his care anymore. Oliver is
          too frightened of the whirling bath to give a damn
          about the doctor. Archie goes and we stay with Oliver.

          70 INT. A SMALL BEDROOM IN THE DANNER HOUSE


          JUST BEFORE DAWN
          Three weeks ago. Oliver is wide awake, wolfing down a
          loaf.of bread that he has stolen from the Danner kitchen.
          As he gnaws on the bread, he listens to indistinct
          sounds from the master bedroom. moans and groans,
          a sudden cry, all of which he supposes are the sounds
          of love-making. He grins to himself in the dark.
          Abruptly a door opens and Petulia is coming down the
          hall. She has hastily put on a pair of slacks and a
          blouse, and is struggling into a coat. Her hair is
          tousled, her face filled with anguish.

          71 INT. STAIRWAY DANNER HOUSE

          Petulia is hurriedly taking the hurriedly dressed
          Oliver down the steps. He is protesting. Before they
          can reach the front door, the door of the master
          bedroom opens. David is standing there in his
          pyjama pants.

          DAVID
          Hey, "San Francisco"!
          He pronounces it like Oliver does. He comes down
          the steps, three at a time. He stops before the kid.

          DAVID

          (GENTLY)
          I sure hope there's no hard feelings.
          Oliver understands none of this, and of course David
          knows this, but it doesn't stop him.

          DAVID
          It isn't a question of hospitality, I
          want you to understand that. I feel
          terrible. Dragging you all the way
          up to San Francisco and then not even
          showing you Fisherman's Wharf.

          to the car.

          He stoops down beside the boy and shows him a
          wrist watch.

          DAVID
          You've go to have some little memento.
          Right?

          PETUL IA
          David, for God's sakes
          The wrist watch is much too big for Oliver's skinny
          wrist so David starts to fasten it around Oliver's
          biceps. Even this is too skinny so David starts
          fastening it around Oliver's lower leg. Oliver
          has no idea what is happening, but his hustler's
          heart tells him he is being given something very
          valuable. Petulia is repelled.

          DAVID
          (to Oliver)
          You see the basic problem is we just don't
          have the room for all the folks my old
          lady invites for a visit. Were kinda
          short of room. I'd give you the shirt off
          my back. I'm West-Texas and proud of it.
          But start loading up the house with
          make-believe kids, plus every Tom, Dick
          and Harry whose one and only claim to
          fame is that he knows how to do "it" --

          72 EXT. DANNER HOUSE DAWN

          Petulia begins sobbing, and trying to tug the boy
          toward the lift.

          DAVID
          Hands off!
          The watch won't fasten to the leg either. David
          tries to fit it around the boy's neck. David begins
          to cry.

          button. which starts it moving upward.

          way., Have a real old-fashioned fiesta;
          We'll have a ball; "Oliver?"
          During the preceding speech we CUT to Petulia and Oliver,
          Oliver, infuriated at Petulia, defiantly shows her that he
          has David's watch in his fist.

          OL I VER
          He give me!
          Petulia stares out toward the sea. Davis is still screaming
          atl.them, and his voice sounds so unlikely in all the splendor
          of morning coming to San Francisco.

          This is the house in which Oliver is boarding. Now, as
          Archie drives up, there is no sign of anybody. Archie
          crosses to the door, puzzled. He knocks on the door but
          there is no answer. He goes around to the back. There's
          an old car without wheels, butane tanks, other junk but no
          sign of life. Archie knocks on the back door and finally
          the door is opened. Beyond the screen door is the Mexican

          is annoyed.

          in the bed with a rubber stop in his mouth to keep him from
          swallowing his tongue until he regains consciousness. His
          false teeth lie on the table beside him. Archie is plunged
          deeper into the sense of the unreal.

          76 INT. A HOSPITAL ROOM

          Petulia is in a two-bedded room. She has blue Cornflowers
          and a hairbrush. She is conscious now but looks quite wan.

          In the next bed is a middle-aged lady looking at T.V.

          Who is this guy, Mendoza? Why am I
          always finding you in a different bed?

          Furniture Is pushed back and three pup tents circle the
          center of the room. Archie and his sons have been having
          a camp-in. They are all dressed in jeans and sweat shirts
          and Stevie even wears moccasins - as though they were in
          the:High Sierras. The remainders of T.V. dinners are
          scattered around plus. Coke bottles plus their bed rolls
          from last night. Actually though it :rust: have sounded.
          like a great idea the two bogs are very bored, Archie,,:
          though trying to be "with-it' is far away,, and they sense
          it.

          STEVIE.
          Shouldn't we police the area?

          ARCHIE
          Switch the fire off then.
          Stevie goes to switch the electric fireplace off.

          MIKE
          It's really keen, Dad.
          The bell rings and Polo is standing there, She looks around,
          smiling.

          POLO
          I' don't believe it.

          STEVIE
          Even canteens, Mom.

          Is Dad allowed to come to the Roller
          Derby? I mean since Uncle Warren
          couldn't?
          He is so bad at matchmaking that Polo and Archie can hardly
          keep a straight face.

          78 INT. ROLLER DERBY

          The place is almost empty, but the, fans are wildly
          enthusiastic and are placed to look ;like thousands for the
          T.V. camera. The women's team is on the rink, skating,
          0 banging into each other with great good-natured brutality,
          One of the skaters bucks another clear off the rink, smashing
          through the rail.
          The kids are in heaven, but Polo is so shocked she instinc-

          Out of habit, he lets her, even touching the back of her'

          intently.
          The women are really brutal with each other. One small
          blonde lady is being, pummelled unmercifully by several
          others. As her head twists and turns from the forest of
          fists she seems to become Petulia.

          the grandstand.
          Archie finds a telephone booth. Polo watches him at the
          â€¢ phone booth.
          Her eyes lose their warmth.
          The women's team races around the track. Archie returns with
          a box of Cracker Jacks.

          enormous cotton giraffe, obviously a gift. The patient in

          "It's easy to be an angel when you're
          old and worn out and nobody wants you
          anymore," You see we do try, Petulia.
          I mean there you were in that man's
          apartment. Where I come from ...in "little
          pockets of ignorance" I suppose you'd call

          move to leave,

          MR. DANNER
          In the hospital of my dreams people
          won't be chased out like sheep. People
          are better than most of the medicines
          they give you. David has finally'got
          around to repairing that wharf. He hired
          a couple of boys. The three of them are
          really working up a sweat. He's thinking
          of sailing all the way down the coast to
          Lima. That's in Peru.
          All through this there's no response whatever from Petulia.
          Her eyes are fixed on the eyes of the giraffe.

          MR. DANNER
          They say Lima is a terrific city. If
          you watch out for flies and take sensible
          sanitary precautions. I'll tell you a
          secret but don't you snitch: I'm using
          propaganda on David so that the four of
          0 us can go. Mother's a better sailor than
          I am. Even though I served eighteen
          months on a mine sweeper. Which should

          now from his controlled emotion. Petulia will not take her

          grumbling something about "what's sauce for the goose should
          be' sauce for the gander", etc. Mr. Danner abruptly takes a
          â€¢ small leather bound photograph from his pocket. It's the
           wedding picture of Petulia and David. Without a word he puts
           it on the night stand. Petulia will not look at it.

          During Sc. 79E and 80 we continue to hear Mr. Danner:. Its
          a tiny bus station and hardly anyone is around this time of
          mo'rnin'g. Petulia waits with Oliver who is very annoyed at
          what has been done to him. A few other early travelers are
          about.- As the bus comes into sight, Oliver, grasping his last
          chance of freedom, suddenly darts away. IN A SERIES OF
          FLASHES we see Oliver; hit by a car; the look of agony on
          Petuliaa's face; the reaction of the spectators; and finally
          the ultimate image: the boy pinned under the wheel.

          this room is?
          He loses all his aplomb, He squats, he points, he finds

          Mrs. Danner? They picked her up.
          Dr. Worthington said it was alright
          so long as she had proper nursing.

          ARCHIE
          Who picked her up.

          He hurries down the hall. The'nun is startled.

          OLD MAN
          Take care of the sick people! I'm
          in tip-top shape!

          81E EXT. DANNER HOUSE DAY

          Archie hops off the lift as it reaches the bottom of the
          cliff. At the front of the house we see David and two
          colored men at work on the wharf. At the wharf is the
          yacht. Archie racies up to the nearest door and begins
          ringing the bell.

           85 INT. THE MASTER BEDROOM

           Petulia couldn't be lovelier, or happier. She's in a

          IS
          special hospital bed. There are flowers everywhere. She
          has her own colour T.V. set which is silently showing
          scenes of violence. An efficient nurse is in attendance.

          0 The nurse is sitting at the foot of the bed, and Petulia
          is brushing the nurse's hair.
          Archie stands in the doorway overwhelmed at the normality
          of it all. Obviously Petulia has fixed her hair too.

          PETULIA
          Hi Archie.
          Dazedly Archie crosses to the night stand where there
          is a pitcher of tomato juice. Because he has nothing
          else to do he sniffs the tomato juice,

          PETULIA
          (to nurse)
          This is Dr. Bollen of the Hospital.
          He's a splendid doctor,
          (to Archie)
          This is Agnes Lillywhite.

          NURSE
          Our young lady is doing nicely. We
          have a few problems, but nothing
          serious.

          PETULIA
          â€¢ I get hiccups.` I go along merrily
          hiccupping for hours on end.

          ARCHIE
          Why did you leave the hospital?

          PETULIA
          I was feeling ever so much better, Archie.
          Mrs. Danner looks in. She is wearing an apron and
          stirring a batch of something.

          MRS. DANNER
          Will you be staying for lunch, sir?
          Goodness knows there's plenty of meatloaf.
          She goes and David enters. He looks extremely handsome.
          He wears white duck pants and a slip-over sweater. And
          a happy-go-lucky grin.

          PETULIA
          You two haven't met.
          (to David)
          This is Dr. Bollen.

          Yes, I thought so. Hello, there!
          David sees that Archie has no intention of shaking
          his hand, so he crosses to the bed and begins to
          playfully Drank Petulia up and down.

          ARCHIE
          (to Petulia)
          I want you to go back to the hospital.

          DAVID
          Dr. Worthington says she's doing fine.
          He's going to make daily house calls.

          PETULIA
          He's very good about that.

          ARCHIE

          MR. DANNER
          Dr. Bollen, I wouldn't exactly call
          this good taste. Not to mention
          medical ethics.

          DAVID
          Dad, you old fuddy-duddy, things happen.
          Archie suspects he is having a nightmare. With the
          exception of Mr. Danner, he has never seen so many
          cheerful people in one place.

          ARCHIE

          I want you to remember what this man
          just said.
          (to Archie)
          Though it's none of your business, my
          boy was in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
          Looking at boats.

          PETULIA
          We've decided we're quite happy with
          the one we have.

          DAVID
          When Dad phoned me I was having dinner
          with a cousin of ours. Real mouth-
          watering Creole cooking.
          He and Petulia chuckle at each other as though this
          were some kind of private joke. Archie crosses to
          Petulia and just stands there looking at her. He
          doesn't know what to do.

          PETULIA

          (HAPPILY)
          I'm fine Archie. Except I burp a lot.
          Everybody gets dizzy spells.
          Archie looks incredulously from Petulia who has resumed
          brushing the nurse's hair; to David; to Mr. Danner who's
          obviously annoyed at Archie's bad taste; to Mrs. Danner
          who is in the dining room setting up an extra place
          for Archie. What can he do? Abruptly he rushes from
          the house.

          Archie runs toward the lift that will move him up the
          cliff. He can't get away fast enough. He climbs into
          the lift and pushes the button. The lift begins moving,
          but too slowly for him. He hops off the lift and begins
          scrambling up the side of the cliff.

          87 INT. PETULIA'S BEDROOM

          Petulia looks out the window and sees Archie scrambling
          up the cliff, She fits a curler into the nurse's hair.

          PETULIA'S VOICE
          Going back to the house was the only
          thing I could do.

          87A EXT. ATOP CLIFF DAY

          Petulia is waiting for Archie at the top of the cliff
          as he staggers toward her. Since everything is taking
          place in her mind, this is how Petulia really is.

          Where else could I go? A lonely hotel
          room? I don't have a penny of my own.
          Mr. Danner promised me I'd never be left
          alone. I thought I'd try it for a few
          days. Don't be-angry. It was nobody's
          fault. Actually, if anyone is to blame,

          to reclaim his coat, Petulia rushes up to him, with
          none of the fake nonsense of the actual meeting, but
          with absolute desperation. Archie is dressed as he
           is on the hill (Scene 86).

          Coming for me in that pokey little car.

          87D EXT. A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY ROAD DAY

          In Petulia's mind, a great white ambulance is moving
          majestically through towering trees, carrying Petulia
          to safety.

          PETULIA'S VOICE

          (CONTINUING)

          As though you really meant it.

          ARCHIE'S VOICE
          I didn't know what to do. I was going
          from one moment to the next.

          PETULIA'S VOICE
          Spectacular entrance, lousy exit. Sounds
          familiar, Archie.
          Suddenly all the anger goes out of Petulia.

          PETULIA'S VOICE:
          No, it's not your fault.

          87E THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE DAY
          Petulia dismisses the ambulance from her mind because
          she has something very serious to say to Archie. She
          is with him on the rocks below the bridge.

          PETULIA
          I went back to the house because I owed it
          to David. I have a brown thumb when it
          comes to men. I put them on the Cross and
          call them Jesus. And there they hang. I
          don't know why I do it. Not because of any
          high opinion of myself... oh, Archie, if you
          only knew...

          She looks up at the bridge and instantly creates David
          standing there. An incredibly heroic figure in a white
          blazer and turtle neck sweater. Yet somehow we must
          sense that despite how grand David looks, at any moment
          in Petulia's mind he may leap to his death.

          PETULIA
          Look at him. Isn't he super. A six foot
          three Coca Cola bottle. Empty. I did
          that. I'd ruin you, Archie.

          87F INT. BEDROOM

          We are now back in visual reality with Petulia, and
          the playful David who is trying to make Petulia laugh,
          which she does.

          PETULIA'S VOICE
          David was the gentlest man I ever knew.

           88 EXT. CLIFF

           Archie has neared the top of the cliff. His pants are
           ripped, his hands are scraped, he is gasping in anguish.

          Â€¢

          PETULIA'S VOICE
          I'd ruin you. In five weeks, I'd be
          running around with a black eye.
          By now, Archie has reached the top of the cliff and is
          a complete mess. He turns for one last look at the
          Danner house and the yacht beyond. He shakes his fist
          maniacally.

          89 EXT0 MUIR WOODS DAY
          During the following SEQUENCE OF SCENES Archie is
          trying to get back to normality. He's having a nice
          sensible talk with Warren Smith, Polo's fiance. It
          is a pleasant sunny day and a group of Indian boys are
          being told about the forest by an Irish guide. In the
          background Archie's two children are playing with
          Warren's child.

          WARREN
          It's never too soon to think of the
          boys' education.
          Warren winks at him knowingly.

          about that?

          Beyond is the entire shockingly beautiful panorama of
          San Francisco. Archie and May are having champagne
          cocktails. They clink glasses and look at each other
          through candlelight. Archie spills some of his cock-
          tail but May doesn't spill a drop. Archie smiles
          hopefully.

          Petulia waves f.rst. Archie waves back. Petulia has

          The cars start down their separate ways.

          93 INT. PENGUIN PLACE DAY

          Thirty penguins march around the rim of their pool to the
          music of Pomp and Circumstance. Through the Public
          Address System, a voice explains that the penguins
          represent all nations and are gathered 'here for their
          own Olympics which they originated two million years ago,
          when penguins were nine feet tall and great athletes.
          Archie senses someone staring at him, turns and sees
          Petulia sitting in the grandstand with her parcels. He
          tries to ignore her by concentrating on his kids, but
          he cannot. Actually, he doesn't want to ignore Petulia.
          He looks back, she is still there, smiling happily.
          Archie gestures for the boys to stay where they are, then
          starts toward Petulia.
          The penguins are now going through various acrobatics
          while the narrator is telling more about their exotic
          origins. Archie stumbles through laughing children,
          ruins a tourist's snapshot, etc., until he finally reaches
          Petulia.
          Now one penguin is pushing another penguin in a baby
          carriage. Everyone thinks it's adorable.
          Archie sits beside Petulia not really knowing what to say.
          He hasn't decided whether to be angry that she has followed
          him,- or amused, or delighted -- or all three.

          Now the taped music is blaring a Loud marching song as
          the penguins lumberingly form into a Roman legion, The
          laughter,, music and applause ?make any intimate conversa-
          tion almost impossible. But Petulia is waiting for
          Archie to say something.
          Archie sees that Mike has turned from the penguins to
          stare at his father accusingly. Mike won't stop staring.
          Mike now tries to make Stevie turn and look accusingly
          with him, Archie doesn't know what to do0
          Finally, Petulia rises and gathers her parcels,, still
          quite pleasant. She drops a parcel and Archie retrieves
          it for hero Its from a sportswear shop,, colorful and
          gay. As Archie gives Petulia the parcel, she touches
          his hand, running her fingers lightly over his skin,
          thoughtful, as though wanting to remember something.
          Petulia moves quickly through people toward the exit.
          Archie almost calls her back, but there is too much noise.

          9. INT. CORRIDOR ARCHIE'S APARTMENT DAY

          Archie is returning from work, weighted down with
          books for his research, plus miscroscope.
          He sees his apartment door ajar. His heart stops.
          He kicks his door open with his foot, not daring to
          think who will be inside.

          95 INT. ARCHIE'S APARTMENT

          No, you're wrong. Its not Petulia. Two elderly
          gentlemen in spotless dungarees are just finishing
          installing a portable greenhouse in Arc hie's living
          room. The Mexican paper flowers have been carefully

          Mac and I get a, big kick out of people's
          first reaction. Its not a toy. It's
          a working greenhouse. You control heat
          and humidity with these.
          (he indicates dials)
          You've got a little bit of everything.
          Ornamental plants,, Zinnias, Asters.
          Even a little vegetable garden. The
          most important thing to remember is
          to keep the sun out. These new kind
          of lights work so much better, there's
          no comparison.

          Then he stops, He knows what screwball.

          ARCHIE
          No gift card?

          FIRST GENTLEMAN
          It might come by mail.
          Archie starts chuckling. He crosses to the green-
          house, still chuckling.

          FIRST GENTLEMAN
          Exactly. We've left a manual of
          operations, and wetll check everything
          out in a month. Okay, Dr. Bollen?

          ARCHIE
          (still chuckling)
          Okay, okay! Goodbye,'
          He enters the greenhouse, having to stoop almost double, as
          the two old gentlemen exit from the apartment.

          96 INT. GREENHOUSE

          Though extremely uncomfortable, Archie is entirely happy.
          Suddenly he is ripping up flowers and vegetables to make a
          kooky bouquet. He is positively exultant. He adds radishes
          and turnips to the bouquet. This is the happiest we have
          ever seen Archie.

          97. EXT. DANNER HOUSE DAY

          Archiets car is parked on the cliff.
          The Danner house is dark, deserted, abandoned.
          Archie is standing by himself on the wharf bouquet in hand.
          The yacht has gone. And so has Petulia.
          Archie feels utterly alone, and as a matter of fact, he is.
          He tosses the bouquet into the water. The lettuce floats.

          97A EXT. THE YACHT DAY

          Theoretically, we should be at some flea bag port in South
          America. Mostly, we SEE the yacht.

          Petulia is sunbathing on the yacht. She looks much better
          now. Weeks have passed, she has a golden tan. Beside her,
          a transistor radio has picked up a local broadcast which
          would be in either Spanish or Portuguese and which consists
          mostly of music.
          David hops onto the yacht carrying a bag of groceries.
          He, too, is deeply tanned, marvelously healthy, but somehow
          uneasy.

          DAVID
          Hi.

          PETULIA
          Did you get mama on the plane all right?

          DAVID
          Sure. But what a dinky plane. Poor
          mamats stomach problems are far from over.
          He enters the cabin. Petulia sits up after a moment, looks
          about, sees no one else, then then in alarm peers into one
           of the windows that looks down into the cabin.

          David is stowing food into the refrigerator.

          PETULIA
          You didn't leave papa alone in that
          horrible little town?

          DAVID

          He uses the English way of saying "vitamin," and then a bit
          too rakishly he tosses an orange up through the window.
          Instinctively, Petulia makes an effort to catch, misses,
          and it hits her lightly on the shoulder. Though it causes
          no damage,'David is suddenly in terror. He races up out
          of the cabin to Petulia.

          97C EXT. YACHT DAY

          David rushes to Petulia. Of course the orange did no damage
          whatever, but there is an abrupt tension between them. He
          flops down beside her and begins peeling the orange,

          DAVID
          Papa went with her at the last minute.
          Petulia REACTS, shocked.

          DAVID

          (CONTINUING)
          She was so pale and seared. They aren't
          even pressurized. The plane. You suck
          on a tube and hope it's oxygen.

          S
          During this he has peeled the orange and torn it into
          segments, which he now tries to feed her.

          DAVID
          Open.

          PETULIA
          How could he have gone? Just like that?

          DAVID
          Where mama is concerned, papa is a very
          loving man. Open.
          Instead, Petulia jumps frightened to her feet, She seems
          about to leave the yacht.

          Please don't.

          A middle-aged couple are passing by on their way to their
          luxurious yacht which is anchored close by. They are
          trailed by a rather tacky Mari-ache trio,

          W OMAN
          Hello there you gorgeous people.
          Everyone's invited for Margueritas
          and cha-cha-cha.

          (a`s corny as this)
          Oooh la la; Lucky you;
          The group goes off, toward their yacht. Petulia doesn't know
          what to do. David skims off his jeans and jackknifes into
          the water. The sun glints on his exquisite body. Confusedly,
          Petulia pops a segment of an orange into her mouth. David
          surfaces from the water laughing up at her. He looks great.

          97D EXT. YACHT NIGHT

          Petulia and David are returning from the other yacht. They
          are dressed casually, but very well. David is completely
          happy. Petulia is uneasy -- uneasy hell, she's frightened
          out of her wits. From the other yacht we still hear the
          SOUNDS of the Mariache trio and people squealing with delight
          David is humming along with the music.

          PETULIA
          We didn't have to come back this early..

          DAVID
          You're still not one hundred per cent
          well.
          They've reached the cabin. He enters. She waits outside.
          Suddenly his hand is around her wrist, somewhat too hard, and
          in a gesture he hopes is playful, he pulls her down the steps
          into the cabin.

          Only a crazy man hits a woman. Or a
          coward. T won't ever again. I'd

          Petulia lies under the sheet, silent, rigid, David
          abruptly crosses to a cabinet and takes out a signal flare
          pistol. He snaps in a flare and tosses it at Petulia.
          She sits up in panic.

          meets David carrying a silly, sweet gift. David
          tenses for a show-down, Archie impulsively flips out
          David's tie and continues on his way,

          As Archie exits from the hospital a kid on a roller
          board almost kills him.
          He has an ice cream bar. He sees three pretty girls,
          one with blonde hair like Petulia's. But it's the
          dark-haired girl who feels his gaze and looks back.
          Archie, watching the girl, and eating his ice cream,
          leans against an electrical appliance shop window.
          Inside, among endless other items is a single T.V.
          tube, on which the world's violence flickers silently
          and unnoticed as before.
          As we leave Archie, we feel a sense of euphoria -- well,
          what do you know, it all ended rather sweetly after all.

          101 INT. DELIVERY ROOM

          Petulia is looking up at the bright light on the
          ceiling. Two hands move toward her face holding an
          ether mask. The hands seem infinitely gentle. One
          hand touches Petulia's face to reassure her.

          PETULIA
          (in a whisper)
          Archie .?

          


                                 THE END
