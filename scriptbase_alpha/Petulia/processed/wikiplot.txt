The film has a non-linear construction with frequent flash-backs and flash-forwards (especially at the beginning of the film.)
The title character is a young San Francisco socialite married to a savagely abusive man.
She finagles a meeting with physician Archie Bollen, whom she first saw and with whom she became smitten as he treated an injured Mexican boy.
Bollen is in the process of divorcing his wife, is sifting through new relationships with his ex, the new man in her life, his sons, and friends who knew him only as one-half of a couple.
The two soon embark on a quirky relationship.
