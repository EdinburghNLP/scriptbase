</b>                                                   March 30, 1967

<b>          
</b>


<b>          1 ALLEY LOADING PLATFORM AND CORRIDOR OF FAIRMONT HOTEL
</b>
<b>          NIGHT
</b>          The story begins in this grubby alley, where two extra
          large ambulances screech to a stop beside a loading
          platform. Onlookers gather in the alley entrance to
          see how many people died; nobody died, the backdoors
          of the ambulances are opened by attendants, and six
          perfectly fine victims of perfectly terrible automobile
          accidents are lifted into wheelchairs.
          The cripples are beautifully dressed, the men in tuxedos,
          the women in splendid evening dresses. One of the women
          wears a neck brace which forces her always to look
          skyward, so she cantt see the beautiful orchid corsage
          pinned to her bosom.
          Quickly, attendants roll the wheelchairs past all the
          stacks of fruit and vegetables on the loading platform,
          past great bales of laundry, past whatever horrors one
          finds behind the warm, smiling face of a hotel. Watch-
          men, pastry cooks, valets are watching the rush of the
          wheelchairs without much interest.
          Then doors swing open, and we are in the tram It of the
          grand ballroom.

<b>          2 INTO GRAND BALLROOM
</b>          It is a charity ball. The sign says "Shake for Highway
          Safety."' The wheelchairs and their occupants no longer
          interest us. They are the guests of honor, and people
          gather about them to arrange them appealingly, and we
          rush past the go-go band, the shakers, and the door
          prize, which is a little convertible, spinning endlessly
          on a pedestal.
          CAMERA reaches PETULIA, who is dancing with her husband,
          DAVID, but trying not to lose sight of ARCHIE. ARCHIE
          really wants to leave, but he is too polite to make it
          too obvious. As he bends over to put his punch cup on
          a table, he is bumped by the wheelchair of one of the
          guests of honor. He is not at all comfortable.

<b>          E
</b>          It's not easy for Petulia to keep an eye on Archie;
          gasping faces get in the ways hunks of twisting bodies
          get in the way, and the dance won't end. The music
          stops for a second, everyone sags and thinks, "Thank
          God it's over," but instantly the music begins again
          and everyone good naturedly swears, "Those crazy kids
          are trying to kill us," and meanwhile Petulia sees
          that Archie has reached the place where you get your
          coat.

<b>          MED. ARCHIE
</b>          He is searching through his pockets for the ticket
          that will let him reclaim his coat. All the coats
          are in an incredible piles and in the semi-hysterical
          care of a debutante attendant.

<b>          PETULIA' S VOICE
</b>          You can't leave
          He turns and sees Petulia.

<b>          PETULIA
</b>          You're an official host.
          She nods to the ribbon and cardboard which along with
          'Official Host' says Dr. A. Bollen. Archie takes the
          ribbon off, as though to pin it on Petulia.

<b>          PETULIA
</b>          Careful. Can you tell I'm not wearing
          a brassiere?

<b>          ARCHIE
</b>          No.

<b>          PETULIA
</b>          Don't think about it. It will only
          excite you.
          Archie finally finds the ticket for his coat, which the
          attendant now tries to find. On through this Petulia
          continues.

<b>          PETULIA

<b>          ARCHIE
</b>          Ahh ...

<b>          PETULIA
</b>          I've been married six months and I've
          never had an affair,

<b>          ARCHIE
</b>          It can happen

<b>          PETULIA
</b>          Don't take it so bloody well. I've just
          turned you down. He's looking at us.
          My husband,

<b>          MED. DAVID WITH HIS MOTHER AND FATHER
</b>          somewhere near the free whiskey table asking for Pernod,
          which, of course, they don't have.
          The father is watching the charity affair with utter
          disapproval. He tips a waiter by shoving a half-dozen
          raffle tickets into the waiter's jacket pocket,

<b>          MR, DANNER
</b>          I hope you win the car, sir,
          Mrs. Danner is charmed by her husband's generosity.
          She simply adores the man. David is busy not watching
          Archie and Petulia,

<b>          PETULIA'S VOICE
</b>          Isn't he gorgeous? He's a naval architect.
          It really zings when you say it. "My
          husband David is a naval architect."
          Actually, we're starving. You wouldn't
          want to buy a sixty foot sloop? David's
          "Momma"` and "Poppa' keep us. Look how
          disgusted Poppa is. He hates this sort
          of thing.

<b>          PETULIA'S VOICE
</b>          Sensitive, my ass. He's bored. Highway
          safety's so blah. Also, he hates amateurs.
          Give him something he can sink his teeth
          into - "Rheumatoid Arthritis" Â® "Muscular
          Dystrophy"' -m and he's the best there is.
          A real pro. A little lame girl with a
          ribbon in her hair and a crutch under her
          arm, and Poppa can set the world on fire.
          He's really slumming tonight.

<b>          BARNEY'S VOICE
</b>          Hello, Archie.

<b>          MED. PETULIA AND ARCHIE
</b>          have been joined by BARNEY and WILMA, Archie's best
          friends. Barney and Wilma are taking off their coats.
          Barney is already beginning to move to the music.
          0 Wilma is doing absolutely nothing but looking at
          Petulia.

<b>          WILMA
</b>          Everybody came late.

<b>          ARCHIE
</b>          I came early. G'bye Wilma. G'bye
          Barney.

</b>          Could you describe the coat?

<b>          ARCHIE
</b>          A. coat. A raincoat. Sleeves.
          Barney has begun to snap his fingers and move his shoulders,
          becoming part of "The Scene", about which Wilma couldn't
          care less.

<b>          WILMA

<b>          WI LMA
</b>          Alright, then. I won't tell you who
          I bumped into last week

<b>          ARCHIE
</b>          buying a well larded rib roast.

<b>          WILMA
</b>          Smarty. Have you seen what she's done
          to her hair?

<b>          ARCHIE
</b>          Wild, huh?

<b>          WILMA
</b>          I said, "Polo, for heaven's sake, you
          look like a teenager."
          Archie doesn't seem too interested and, besides, all
          this is said while Wilma continues to look at Petulia.

<b>          Â€¢
</b>
<b>          WILMA
</b>          Your Mike's getting so fat. Is that
          much weight good for a boy his age?

</b>
<b>          (SHRUGGING)
</b>          If it's alright for a rib roast

<b>          WILMA
</b>          Smarty.
          Barney suddenly forgets the music to rescue his Vicuna
          coat which the debutante is smothering under other
          coats as she finally finds Archie's.

<b>          W ILMA
</b>          (to Petulia)
          I don't believe we've met.

<b>          PETULIA

</b>          Wilma moves off with Barney. Archie can't spend one
          more second with his coat. He simply puts it on, and
          turns to leave, walking toward the door.

<b>          PETULIA
</b>          My name is Petulia,

<b>          ARCHIE

<b>          ARCHIE
</b>          Ex-wife, G' night.
          Petulia turns to face her husband David, who has taken a few
          steps toward her. She whirls around to face the departing
          Archie.

<b>          PETULIA
</b>          Archie!
          He turns, almost at the door.

          a great metal tag (as an example of how this might be
          designed, I recommend visiting a drive-in bank in Los

          Archie's hands are soothing him even as they so gently

          Archie stops his dressing long enough to gaze at this girl

          ground. A nurse assists Archie. Oliver is a brave, solemn
          little boy, with shadows of fatigue around his eyes. He
          is also a tough little bastard, let me tell you. He is
          now wearing the broken gold watch; though to fit his
          skinny wrist the band has been tied in a knot,

          liquid which instantly dries a violent blue and then very
          quickly starts changing into all the colors of the rainbow.

          emanating from the computer, each sound again indicating a
          physical condition. The patient's room looks like a comfy
          hotel room: wood paneling, couches, magazines, plants.

          This is a really glorified pressure chamber where a complete
          atmosphere is created to suit whatever surgery is going on.
          The patient can no longer be seen. He is draped in plastic
          which creates a sub-atmosphere. The doctors and nurses
          are swathed in plastic, again in the atmosphere that lets
          them function best, (This is for real. It exists, for
          instance, at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York.) The doctors
          and nurses communicate with each other through throat
          mikes and seem like other world automatons. In all this

          Archie has just parked his car and is going toward the
          entrance, when he sees Petulia sitting on a bus-stop
          bench, the tuba beside her. She is dozing.

          She opens her eyes, smiles.

</b>          I'm drunk.

</b>          How'm I prying?

<b>          PETULIA
</b>          I'll go home by bus.

<b>          ARCHIE
</b>          If I were prying, I would ask you how you
          broke your rib. Right?

          Somehow or other we begin to sense that madness has

          Archie stands there, holding the tuba and feeling
          stupid. Haplessly, he returns to his car and begins
          stowing the tuba inside, banging it against his nose
          in the process. He is a far from happy man.

          another room. He is a big, sleepy-eyed Mexican. He
          has just awakened, is wearing his pajama bottoms and
          is hairy, sweaty and fat.
          Petulia obviously knows tlleiman, nods hello, to which
          the man answers a non-committal grunt. He squeezes
          past Petulia to drink from the sink. He sticks his

          He finds the situation amusing, reaching in past Petulia
          to grab an orange. There should be a feeling of a
          possible relationship between Petulia and this man.
          In the next room a screen door opens and closes.

          Archie is doing research at a desk. Working from notes,
          he is talking into a tape recorder about new techniques
          in the treatment of arthritis that would not require
          surgery. This is a moment to glimpse Archie as a
          thoughtful man. There are a couple of beer bottles

          Petulia waits on the steps. When she is not being observed,
          when she is not "on," there are moments when Petulia seems
          utterly forlorn. This is such a moment. But then she sees
          Archie and May and instantly she is "with it."

</b>          She said there was this elderly lady whose
          first husband used to play tuba with John

          But Petulia just sits on the edge of a chair tapping
          her fingers in annoyance. Mr. Howard leaves. The door
          remains open for Petulia to leave. May watches Petulia
          in amused tolerance.

          sometimes glimpse Petulia when no one else is looking
          and see beyond the kookiness, so for an instant we see
          beyond Archie's look of professional assurance and see
          the fearful uncertainty. He now moves into the corridor,
          with each step assuming the doctor's look that is expected

          Petulia and Archie leave the supermarket with their rolling

          him. She starts running toward the car, suddenly wanting
          0 very much to be with him. They kiss lightly.

          Archie is sound asleep, breathing heavily. Petulia sits
          wrapped in a blanket on the floor near the window, her
          head resting on the sill, lonely.

<b>          42 TNT. ARCHIE'S BEDROOM NIGHT

          we see Archie drinking a lonesome Coke.

<b>          43 INT. ARCHIES BEDROOM NIGHT
</b>
          Petulia and Archie are both in the bed, asleep and
          somehow as far apart as two human beings can be.

<b>          44 INT. ARCHIE'S BEDROOM NIGHT
</b>
          In the midst of her sleep, Petulia begins jabbering in
          some language all her own. Archie Is eyes open and he
          looks at her and he smiles. Still sound asleep,
          Petulia finishes her statement, whatever the hell it
          was and settles down on the pillow. Archie looks at her.
          She wakes up. They look at each other so gravely that
          they both begin to smile. Neither one is having the
          best night of their life but both are aware of a sense
          â€¢ of tenderness that has caught them unexpectedly.
          45 INT. ARCHIEtS BEDROOM MORNING
          Petulia wakes up suddenly. Though she is nude under the
          sheets, Archie is fully dressed for his day with the
          boys. Though his clothes are very sporty he looks
          anything but sporty as he talks quietly into the phone-

<b>          ARCHIE

          Okay. Wells why not do some slides anyhow?
          (in sudden anger)
          To satisfy myself, that's who. Okay.
          He hangs up the phone and sees Petulia looking at him.

<b>          ARCHIE
</b>          Well, we knocked off another one. Another

</b>          tions to follow,, we begin seeing the moments which have
          brought on Petulia's current crisis with Oliver.

<b>          48 INT. BULL RING TIJUANA
</b>
          It's a hot summer afternoon. Petulia and David have
          driven down from San Francisco. They are members of the
          "San Francisco Matador Club". David has drunk too much
          wine from his bota bag and the sour wine and the hot sun
          have made him violently ill. Though there are still two
          bulls left to kill, David and Petulia are leaving. As she
          moves down the spindly stairway, Petulia becomes aware of
          Oliver. He is with a gang of other kids at the butcher
          shed where the previous bulls are being dressed for market.
          They are all soaking banderillos in blood so they can be
          sold as "the real thing" .

<b>          49 EXT. A STREET IN TIJUANA
</b>
          Petulia and David in their convertible. David has passed
          out in the back seat and Petulia is having a hell of a
          time trying to move the car out of the parking space.
          Again kids swarm about her like wild animals, trying to
          sell hats, cushions, gum, pottery, etc. Again she sees
          Oliver among them (or is it another kid who looks like
          0 Oliver?) ,

<b>          40 50 EXT. BORDER GATE AT TIJUANA LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
          Thousands of cars are waiting to get through. Hot, noisy,
          dusty, unbearable. Kids storm every car, hustling their
          captured audience. Among them is Oliver. Have the others
          been Oliver? In Petulia's exhaustion and discomfort, the
          heat, the flies, the blaring horny she can't be sure.
          (NOTE, All through the Tijuana scenes, we HEAR Archie
          and Petulia's telephone conversation. It is utterly banal
          and they know it and are amused by its banality.)
          PETULIA: I was dozing.
          ARCHIE: That's good.
          PETULIA: You left without having breakfast.
          ARCHIE: I had a cup of coffee on the way.
          PETULIA: A cup of coffee. You should have had
          eggs or waffles.
          ARCHIE: I'm fine.
          PETULIA: Me too.

<b>          PAUSE
</b>          PETULIA: I had a tall glass of pineapple juice.
          ARCHIE: Make some toast, too. And milk.
          Breakfast is a very important meal.
          PETULIA: I wish you'd remember that.
          ARCHIE: Well, goodbye.
          0 PETULIA: Archie?
          ARCHIE: Yes?
          PETULIA: You won't forget to phone.

          Archie hangs up the phone and starts running with his sons
          toward the boat. He is very pleased with his absolutely
          nothing phone conversation.

<b>          52 EXT. BOAT DECK
</b>
          Children run scurrying around the mildly crowded deck.
          The boat is passing Alcatraz Island. Archie and the boys
          are standing at the rail,

<b>          ARCHIE
</b>          They used to think that escape from that
          prison was impossible.

<b>          STEVIE

<b>          ARCHIE

          been before, Stevie.

<b>          MIKE
</b>          In fact, we don't call him Stevie anymore.

<b>          ARCHIE
</b>          Who doesn't?

<b>          MIKE
</b>          Mom thinks he's getting a little old for
          being called Stevie, in fact.

<b>          ARCHIE
</b>          I called you Stevie two weeks ago -e we were all

<b>          MIKE

          can get out of anything if you want to bad
          enough.

<b>          ARCHIE
</b>          That's what Warren said, eh?

<b>          MIKE
</b>          Yes, Dad.

<b>          53 ANOTHER VIEW OF THE BOAT
</b>          The boys are watching Archie who is in that section of the
          boat where the radar and electronic equipment are kept.
          Archie is on the ship telephone. He is trying to keep
          a straight face but since he is obviously talking to Petulia,
          it is difficult.

          Archie really does like his kids but his thoughts are
          somewhere else.

<b>          54 INT. A FISH PLACE ON THE WHARF
</b>
          While Mike and Stevie are gorging themselves, Archie
          is at the wall telephone.

<b>          ARCHIE
</b>          â€¢ Hello there.

<b>          LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
<b>          55 EXT. THE BORDER GATE AT TIJUANA
</b>
          During this silent scene we watch Oliver seduce Petulia
          into giving him a lift in her convertible. Petulia is
          so bored as the cars take hours to get past the gate,
          Oliver is an absolute scoundrel. David is such a clod,
          passing out in the back seat, his legs hanging out over
          the door of the car, one sandal missing. His beautiful
          face is somehow an obscene parody of itself, fiery
          red from the sun.
          Oliver mimics David, Petulia, the guard at the gate,
          dances, skips, romps, annoys Petulia, makes her laugh,
          dares her, goads her. Finally, when Petulia's car is
          just one away from the border guard, Oliver impudently
          hops into the seat beside her, expecting to be thrown
          out but also expecting maybe a nickel in the bargain.
          But the joke's on Oliver. Petulia is even kookier than
          he is. Is it the look of David that sickens her? Is
          it her annoyance at having to wait so long and do the
          driving while he lies collapsed and useless? Is it
          that "useless" that goads her?

<b>          53
</b>
<b>          55 CONTINUED
</b>          Most of all Petulia is doing something of absolutely no
          importance; she knows Oliver will hop out of the car the
          moment they reach the guard. All it amounts to is two
          kooks having a few seconds of horsing around.
          The joke is on both of them -- the guard, harassed by
          the honking of thousands of cars and having fully
          inspected the car just ahead of Petulia, waves the
          convertible on through.
          Petulia stops the car a few hundred yards past the
          border to let Oliver climb out, but he just sits there.
          Petulia thinks, "okay, you little bastard . " and
          zooms down the highway, intending to stop at the first
          moment the look of superior arrogance leaves Oliver's
          tough little face.
          During this we hear Archie and Petulia's second tele-
          phone conversation which is as blab and loving as before.
          ARCHIE: Hi, there.
          PETULIA: Hello.
          ARCHIE: I'm having lunch with the boys.
          PETULIA: You eat a good lunch, Archie,
          ARCHIE: I will, I will.
           PETULIA: You only had a cup of coffee for breakfast.
          ARCHIE: I'll eat a good lunch, Petulia.
          PETULIA: Like what?
          ARCHIE: Petulia, they have a thousand different
           things on the menu.
          PETULIA: You should have a sirloin steak with french
          fries or baked beans.
          ARCHIE: Okay.
          PETULIA: That's easy to say, Archie, But I know you.
          ARCHIE: Steak with french fries or baked beans.
          PETULIA: Do they have fresh sea-food?
          ARCHIE: Yes.
          PETULIA: Sea bass is nice.
          ARCHIE: Yes, sea bass is great.
          PETULIA: If they grill it,
          ARCHIE: I'll have grilled sea bass.
          PETULIA: Unless they do a nice omelet.
          ARCHIE: I'm sure they would if I asked.
          PETULIA: It's such a problem.
          ARCHIE: Yes, I know. Goodbye, Petulia.

          Archie sees a telephone above which is a sign which
          says that this phone is for the military and is to be
          used only in emergency. Archie approaches it warily,

<b>          59 INT. ARCHIE'S APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY DAY
</b>
          Archie has had a pretty good day with the boys, is thinking
          â€¢ about Petulia waiting in his apartment, and feels pretty
          damn good about the whole thing. He opens the door of
          his apartment. He is carrying a bag of Mexican paper flowers

<b>          60 INT. APARTMENT
</b>
          It is empty. Archie knows at once that Petulia is gone.
          All the joy goes out of him. The apartment is a mess.
          The television set is on: a program without sound of
          soldiers fighting. Archie is so disappointed that
          Petulia isn't here. He angrily flips the dial getting
          the same type of program.

<b>          ARCHIE
</b>          A nice, neat kid.
          After all the exuberance he feels so empty. Everywhere
          things are scattered about.

<b>          61 INT. BEDROOM
</b>
          The bedroom is the worst of all. The sheets and blanket
          have literally been stripped from the bed and flung pall
          mall onto the floor behind. Archie really is annoyed.
          Then he stops, he crosses slowly to the tangle of sheets
          and blanket on the floor. A lifeless arm protrudes.
          Archie crumples to his knees and tears at the blankets.
          Petulia is broken, bloodied and seemingly dead.

<b>          61 CONTINUED
</b>          Thï¿½-, phone is off the hook. Archie doesn't know where to
          turn first. He feels Petulia's throat for a pulse, isn't
          sure she has one,
          Petulia is wearing his hooded sweatshirt from Se. 23.
          Archie attempts heart massage, but Petuliats so taped up
          from the broken rib that this is impossible.
          Archie presses his mouth over Petulia's to attempt to get
          her breathing again. He tries this only for an instant
          then crosses to the phone, hangs it up and dials an
          emergency number.
          Archie goes back to Petulia. He feels again for a pulse
          in her throat, can find no pulse. He begins trembling.
          As always when a crisis really happens, it isn't as easy
          as the Red Cross advertisements say. Her mouth won't
          open right. His mouth seems unable to make the connection
          with hers. It all looks more like very bad love-making
          than a life-saving procedure.

<b>          62 INT./EXT. HALLWAY &amp; STEPS OUTSIDE ARCH IE' S APARTMENT
</b>
           Two special officers are moving Petulia down a hallway on

<b>          0
</b>          a stretcher. A third walks behind her pressing a rubber
          oxygen mask over her mouth.
          We feel Sunday late afternoon rudely shattered, but limp-
          ing along nevertheless. Television, cokes, sex, stereo,
          facials, isometric exercises. funny-papers, ailments;
          boring endless Sunday late afternoon -- suddenly bloodied.
          Doors are opening up and down the hallway. People come
          out to stare. A big friendly old sheepdog wild with
          enthusiasm, leaps at the stretcher and almost topples
          Petulia. Archie, smeared with Petulia's blood, his
          shirt-tails out, in a state of shock himself, whams the
          dog as hard as he can. This entire sequence should
          seem like a nightmare.
          The dog's owner goes berserk.

<b>          DOG'S OWNER
</b>          Don't you hit Lennie!
          Archie is too distressed about Petulia to even respond.
          At every door there is a tenant. A jumble of voices all
          spoken together.

<b>          1ST TENANT

<b>          5TH TENANT
</b>          Yes'. but they're all racists.
          Of course, one of the officers is a Korean and the other
          a Negro. All through this we have also been aware of many
          T.V. sets, all with programs with various kinds of violence.
          One youbgster comes to the door holding a portable T.V. and
          we see on the tube war casualties being flown out of the
          Jungle by helicopters.
          Archie has crossed ahead of the special officers to lead
          the way down the steps. Half a dozen "hippies"' loaded
          down with Chinese food and a yellow guitar are coming up
          the steps. Everything is chaos.
          The officers just can't manage the stretcher down the
          narrow stairway. Poor Petulia is twisted and turned every
          which way - all in the name of saving her life.

          And its never been the same.
          A record player is playing a Herb Alpert recording and
          the stretcher seems to move along to its rhythm.

<b>          63 EXT. A HIGHWAY RESTAURANT NIGHT
</b>
           This is the stretch of highway 1 - 01 going north from.Mexico.
          The restaurant is a mass of neon, and does very well in,the
          hot coffee department as the sleepy travellers take a
          break on their way north.
          Among the cars many are filled with bull fight
          afficianados.
          It's about ten p.m. There is a general feeling of
          exhaustion and spent passions. People are bleary-eyed,
          recovering from hangovers, beginning to feel the effects
          of sunburns. All this we see later. First we see Oliver.
          Oliver is sitting in the car staring coldly at David who
          0 has just awakened. David is probably just about to say
          "Who the hell are you" when Petulia appears carrying a
          cardboard carton of coffee and orange juice.

</b>          David takes a sip of coffee. Oliver grabs at the orange
          juice, toppling it, spilling some of it on the seat but
          saving most. He gulps it down then uses the straw to
          make bubbles. David looks at Oliver and then at
          Petulia, all through the bubbles.

<b>          PETULIA
</b>          Say hello to "Petulia"s Folly."
          David says nothing.

          Archie is in Petulia's little cubicle slumped on a
          chair, sound asleep. Petulia lies on the bed, tubes
          protruding from arms and neck. She is still unconscious.
          Archie is awakened by a nun entering the cubicle to
          hook up another pint of blood. Archie's presence
          disconcerts the nun. She can't show her annoyance
          openly, but is so disturbed she does her work badly
          this time.

          We spend awhile watching Archie function as a doctor,

          the orthopaedic room.

          Oliver is being given therapy in a whirling bath. He's
          only one of some twenty patients and Archie barely
          notices him, simply waving to him as he does to other
          patients who don't need his care anymore. Oliver is
          too frightened of the whirling bath to give a damn
          about the doctor. Archie goes and we stay with Oliver.

<b>          70 INT. A SMALL BEDROOM IN THE DANNER HOUSE
</b>

<b>          JUST BEFORE DAWN
</b>          Three weeks ago. Oliver is wide awake, wolfing down a
          loaf.of bread that he has stolen from the Danner kitchen.
          As he gnaws on the bread, he listens to indistinct
          sounds from the master bedroom. moans and groans,
          a sudden cry, all of which he supposes are the sounds
          of love-making. He grins to himself in the dark.
          Abruptly a door opens and Petulia is coming down the
          hall. She has hastily put on a pair of slacks and a
          blouse, and is struggling into a coat. Her hair is
          tousled, her face filled with anguish.

<b>          71 INT. STAIRWAY DANNER HOUSE
</b>
          Petulia is hurriedly taking the hurriedly dressed
          Oliver down the steps. He is protesting. Before they
          can reach the front door, the door of the master
          bedroom opens. David is standing there in his
          pyjama pants.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Hey, "San Francisco"!
          He pronounces it like Oliver does. He comes down
          the steps, three at a time. He stops before the kid.

<b>          DAVID
</b>
<b>          (GENTLY)
</b>          I sure hope there's no hard feelings.
          Oliver understands none of this, and of course David
          knows this, but it doesn't stop him.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          It isn't a question of hospitality, I
          want you to understand that. I feel
          terrible. Dragging you all the way
          up to San Francisco and then not even
          showing you Fisherman's Wharf.
          Comprehend.?
          Petulia goes into the living room to find the keys
          to the car.

          What's the rushy Whereas the fire!
          He stoops down beside the boy and shows him a
          wrist watch.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          You've go to have some little memento.
          Right?

<b>          PETUL IA
</b>          David, for God's sakes
          The wrist watch is much too big for Oliver's skinny
          wrist so David starts to fasten it around Oliver's
          biceps. Even this is too skinny so David starts
          fastening it around Oliver's lower leg. Oliver
          has no idea what is happening, but his hustler's
          heart tells him he is being given something very
          valuable. Petulia is repelled.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          (to Oliver)
          You see the basic problem is we just don't
          have the room for all the folks my old
          lady invites for a visit. Were kinda
          short of room. I'd give you the shirt off
          my back. I'm West-Texas and proud of it.
          But start loading up the house with
          make-believe kids, plus every Tom, Dick
          and Harry whose one and only claim to
          fame is that he knows how to do "it" --

          Petulia begins sobbing, and trying to tug the boy
          toward the lift.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Hands off!
          The watch won't fasten to the leg either. David
          tries to fit it around the boy's neck. David begins
          to cry.

          Petulia somehow gets Oliver into the lift and pushes the
          button. which starts it moving upward.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          (calling up)

          way., Have a real old-fashioned fiesta;
          We'll have a ball; "Oliver?"
          During the preceding speech we CUT to Petulia and Oliver,
          Oliver, infuriated at Petulia, defiantly shows her that he
          has David's watch in his fist.

<b>          OL I VER

          Petulia stares out toward the sea. Davis is still screaming
          atl.them, and his voice sounds so unlikely in all the splendor
          of morning coming to San Francisco.

          there is no answer. He goes around to the back. There's
          an old car without wheels, butane tanks, other junk but no
          sign of life. Archie knocks on the back door and finally
          the door is opened. Beyond the screen door is the Mexican

          The women are really brutal with each other. One small

          Archie hops off the lift as it reaches the bottom of the
          cliff. At the front of the house we see David and two
          colored men at work on the wharf. At the wharf is the
          yacht. Archie racies up to the nearest door and begins
          ringing the bell.

          is brushing the nurse's hair.
          Archie stands in the doorway overwhelmed at the normality
          of it all. Obviously Petulia has fixed her hair too.

<b>          PETULIA
</b>          Hi Archie.
          Dazedly Archie crosses to the night stand where there
          is a pitcher of tomato juice. Because he has nothing
          else to do he sniffs the tomato juice,

          This is Dr. Bollen of the Hospital.
          He's a splendid doctor,

          This is Agnes Lillywhite.

</b>          I was feeling ever so much better, Archie.
          Mrs. Danner looks in. She is wearing an apron and
          stirring a batch of something.

</b>          Will you be staying for lunch, sir?
          Goodness knows there's plenty of meatloaf.
          She goes and David enters. He looks extremely handsome.
          He wears white duck pants and a slip-over sweater. And
          a happy-go-lucky grin.

          He and Petulia chuckle at each other as though this
          were some kind of private joke. Archie crosses to
          Petulia and just stands there looking at her. He

          obviously annoyed at Archie's bad taste; to Mrs. Danner

          the lift and pushes the button. The lift begins moving,
          but too slowly for him. He hops off the lift and begins

          majestically through towering trees, carrying Petulia

          blazer and turtle neck sweater. Yet somehow we must
          sense that despite how grand David looks, at any moment
          in Petulia's mind he may leap to his death.

          a complete mess. He turns for one last look at the
          Danner house and the yacht beyond. He shakes his fist

          Thirty penguins march around the rim of their pool to the
          music of Pomp and Circumstance. Through the Public
          Address System, a voice explains that the penguins
          represent all nations and are gathered 'here for their
          own Olympics which they originated two million years ago,
          when penguins were nine feet tall and great athletes.
          Archie senses someone staring at him, turns and sees
          Petulia sitting in the grandstand with her parcels. He
          tries to ignore her by concentrating on his kids, but
          he cannot. Actually, he doesn't want to ignore Petulia.
          He looks back, she is still there, smiling happily.
          Archie gestures for the boys to stay where they are, then
          starts toward Petulia.
          The penguins are now going through various acrobatics
          while the narrator is telling more about their exotic
          origins. Archie stumbles through laughing children,
          ruins a tourist's snapshot, etc., until he finally reaches
          Petulia.
          Now one penguin is pushing another penguin in a baby
          carriage. Everyone thinks it's adorable.
          Archie sits beside Petulia not really knowing what to say.
          He hasn't decided whether to be angry that she has followed
          him,- or amused, or delighted -- or all three.

          and humidity with these.

          You've got a little bit of everything.
          Ornamental plants,, Zinnias, Asters.
          Even a little vegetable garden. The
          most important thing to remember is
          to keep the sun out. These new kind

          Though extremely uncomfortable, Archie is entirely happy.
          Suddenly he is ripping up flowers and vegetables to make a
          kooky bouquet. He is positively exultant. He adds radishes
          and turnips to the bouquet. This is the happiest we have

          Archie is standing by himself on the wharf bouquet in hand.
          The yacht has gone. And so has Petulia.
          Archie feels utterly alone, and as a matter of fact, he is.

          Petulia is sunbathing on the yacht. She looks much better
          now. Weeks have passed, she has a golden tan. Beside her,
          a transistor radio has picked up a local broadcast which
          would be in either Spanish or Portuguese and which consists
          mostly of music.
          David hops onto the yacht carrying a bag of groceries.
          He, too, is deeply tanned, marvelously healthy, but somehow
          uneasy.

          He enters the cabin. Petulia sits up after a moment, looks
          about, sees no one else, then then in alarm peers into one
           of the windows that looks down into the cabin.

          He uses the English way of saying "vitamin," and then a bit
          too rakishly he tosses an orange up through the window.
          Instinctively, Petulia makes an effort to catch, misses,
          and it hits her lightly on the shoulder. Though it causes
          no damage,'David is suddenly in terror. He races up out
          of the cabin to Petulia.

          David rushes to Petulia. Of course the orange did no damage
          whatever, but there is an abrupt tension between them. He
          flops down beside her and begins peeling the orange,

          A middle-aged couple are passing by on their way to their
          luxurious yacht which is anchored close by. They are
          trailed by a rather tacky Mari-ache trio,

          what to do. David skims off his jeans and jackknifes into
          the water. The sun glints on his exquisite body. Confusedly,
          Petulia pops a segment of an orange into her mouth. David
          surfaces from the water laughing up at her. He looks great.

          Petulia and David are returning from the other yacht. They
          are dressed casually, but very well. David is completely
          happy. Petulia is uneasy -- uneasy hell, she's frightened
          out of her wits. From the other yacht we still hear the
          SOUNDS of the Mariache trio and people squealing with delight
          David is humming along with the music.

<b>          PETULIA
</b>          Archie, call the ambulance.
          Archie crosses to the phone, picks up the receiver,
          then almost at once he puts it down again.

<b>          â€¢ PETULIA
</b>          When I lay dying -- twenty years from
          now -- a middle-aged old lady --
          wondering what my life was all about,
          you won't even cross my mind.
          Archie winces. He starts out. He cantt even say
          goodbye.

<b>          PETULIA
</b>          Hey, wait I lied.

<b>          ARCHIE
</b>          About what?

<b>          PETULIA
</b>          I'll never forget you, Arnold.

<b>          ARCHIE
</b>          Arnold?
          He starts laughing, then she starts laughing. He crosses
          to her and holds her hand in his very tightly. Then he
          leaves.

<b>          99 INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY
</b>

<b>          D
</b>          Archie feels unexpectedly giddy and carefree. He
          meets David carrying a silly, sweet gift. David
          tenses for a show-down, Archie impulsively flips out
          David's tie and continues on his way,

<b>          100 EXT0 HOSPITAL DAY
</b>          As Archie exits from the hospital a kid on a roller
          board almost kills him.
          He has an ice cream bar. He sees three pretty girls,
          one with blonde hair like Petulia's. But it's the
          dark-haired girl who feels his gaze and looks back.
          Archie, watching the girl, and eating his ice cream,
          leans against an electrical appliance shop window.
          Inside, among endless other items is a single T.V.
          tube, on which the world's violence flickers silently
          and unnoticed as before.
          As we leave Archie, we feel a sense of euphoria -- well,
          what do you know, it all ended rather sweetly after all.

<b>          101 INT. DELIVERY ROOM
</b>
          Petulia is looking up at the bright light on the
          ceiling. Two hands move toward her face holding an
          ether mask. The hands seem infinitely gentle. One
          hand touches Petulia's face to reassure her.

<b>          PETULIA
</b>          (in a whisper)
          Archie .?
