1.     EXT.  HAPPY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT.               1.

The sign is illuminated.


2.     INT.  HAPPY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT.               2.

Pretty, 30ish JOY JORDAN and teary-eyed STUART sit opposite
each other.  He is trying to resist bursting into tears as
they finish dessert.

JOY
     Stuart?… Are you okay?

STUART
     Yeah. Sure. I'm fine.

JOY
     Good. Well. I had a really nice time.

STUART
     Yeah. Me too.

JOY
     Of course, you know I've always
     had a nice time with you.

STUART
     Same here.

JOY
     But…

STUART
     Yeah.

JOY
     You understand.

STUART
     Unh.

JOY
     And you don't hate me?

STUART
     No.

JOY
     'Cause you know I could never
     hate you. At the same time, I just
     don't think I could ever…you know…
     you.  In the way you should be…

STUART
     Yeah.

JOY
     And deserve to be.

STUART
     Unh hunh.

JOY
     Well. The food here was excellent–
     I'm gonna recommend it to my
     sisters! How many stars did it get?

STUART
     Three and a half.

And the dam cracks wide open.  He bawls.  A pause.

JOY
     Do you feel better now?
(STUART nods)
     Me too.

STUART
     I'm sorry.

JOY
     It's really good we had this talk.

STUART
     Yeah.

JOY
     Before things went too far…
     You know, got too serious.

STUART
     Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm too serious.

JOY
     No, you're not.  It's me.

STUART
     No, it's me.

JOY
     Okay. It's you. I'm sorry.

STUART
     Okay.

Pause.

JOY
     'Cause I mean…

STUART
     I know.

JOY
     The thing is, I want to do what's
     right – for both of us.  I spent
     a lot of time…examining…my heart.
     And I felt that you deserved
     my honesty.

STUART
     Thanks.

Pause.

JOY
     Now I just want to make you
     whole again.

STUART
     I'm whole.

JOY
     Really?

STUART
     Really.

JOY
     …'Cause I was afraid we wouldn't
     be able to be friends anymore.

STUART
(laughing, sort of)
     Oh, Joy!

JOY
     Oh, but you know how it is.
     And well, most guys…

STUART
     I'm not most guys.

JOY
     I know. If only most guys were
     like you.

STUART
     But then I'd be like most guys.

JOY
(laughs)
     Oh, Stuart. If only I felt the way
     I'd like to feel with you… Life is
     so unfair.  It's all my fault.

STUART
     I know.
(a beat)
     Are you sure…?

JOY
     Yes.

Pause.

STUART
     Is it someone else?

JOY
     No, it's just you.

Pause.

STUART
     I want to show you something
     I got for you.

JOY
     For me?

STUART
(hands her a gift)
     Open it up.

JOY
(discovers a pewter ashtray)
     Oh, but Stuart. This is…oh,
     this is beautiful.

STUART
     Thanks. It's a Gainsevoort
     reproduction. Boston, late 1800's.
     I sent away for it just after
     we had our…first date.

JOY
     Oh, I just love it.  It's a…it's a
     collector's item.

STUART
     Yeah, it is pretty special.

JOY
(laughs)
     It almost makes me want to start
     smoking again!

STUART
     Look at the bottom.

JOY
(examines more closely)
     Ooh.

STUART
     Forty karat gold-plate inlaid base.

JOY
     Oh, Stuart. Thank you. This really
     means something to me. I'll always
     treasure it…as a token…

STUART
     No, you won't.
(retrieves his gift;
a sudden shift in emotion:)
     'Cause this is for the girl who
     loves me. The girl who cares for me,
     for who I am, not what I look like.
     I wanted you to know what you'd be
     missing. You think I don't appreciate
     art. You think I don't understand
     fashion. You think I'm not hip.
     You think I'm pathetic, a nerd,
     a lard-ass fatso. You think I'm shit.
     Well, you're wrong. 'Cause I'm
     champagne. And you're shit.
     And till the day you die, you,
     not me, will always be shit.


3.     EXT.  ROAD - NIGHT.                         3.

Thunder.  Rain.  STUART's car drives by.


4.     INT.  STUART'S CAR - NIGHT.                    4.

JOY sits beside STUART, who is driving.  A plastic "World of
Pewter" shopping bag hangs by the glove compartment.


5.     EXT.  JOY'S PLACE - NIGHT.                    5.

The car pulls over.

JOY
     Well, good night.

STUART
     Good night.

JOY gets out.  STUART drives away.

FADE TO BLACK.


6.     INT.  BILL'S OFFICE - DAY.                    6.

ALLEN talks to his psychiatrist, BILL MAPLEWOOD.

ALLEN
     …I dunno, but whenever I see her
     I just want to…you know…I want to
     undress her, I want to tie her up
     and pump her pump pump pump till
     she screams bloody murder. And then
     I want to flip her ass over and
     pump her even more and so hard my
     dick shoots right through her and
     so that my come squirts out of
     her mouth… Not that I could ever
     actually…do that… Oh, if only she
     knew how I felt, how deep down I
     really cared for her, respected her,
     she would love me back. Maybe.
     But she hardly even knows I exist.
     I mean, she knows I exist – we are
     neighbors, we smile politely
     at each other… But I don't know
     how I could ever begin to really
     talk to her, what can I talk about?
     I have nothing to talk about.
     I'm boring. I know. I've been told
     before, so don't tell me it's not
     true. 'Cause it's a fact. I bore
     people. People look at me and they
     get bored. They listen to me and
     they zone out, bored… And for her
     to see how boring I am…no, no, no…
     It's better I say nothing… and hope…
     though right now, I have to say,
     if I were to suddenly jump out of
     my window, she wouldn't care. I mean,
     she'd care, of course, she'd care,
     I mean, she is human, but I mean
     she'd care the way you care about a
     stranger you read about in the paper
     that jumps in front of a running
     subway train, a stranger whose name
     you're never sure how to pronounce,
     if it's even printed. I'd be an
     anectode…maybe. But you know what
     I'm going to do? When I see her
     next time, as soon as I see her,
     I'm just going to tell her…tell her
     I find her…attractive. And that'll
     be that. Then…then we'll see…


7.     EXT.  HIGH RISE - EVENING.                    7.

HELEN parks, gets out of her car, walks towards the
apartment building entrance.


8.     INT.  HIGH RISE LOBBY - EVENING.               8.

HELEN walks towards the elevator and waits beside ALLEN.

ALLEN mumbles something.  HELEN is oblivious.

ALLEN
     How's it going?

HELEN
     Okay.

The elevator arrives.


9.     INT.  ELEVATOR - EVENING.                    9.

ALLEN and HELEN step inside.  They ride in silence up to
their floor.


10.     INT.  HALLWAY - EVENING.                    10.

ALLEN and HELEN emerge from the elevator.

ALLEN
     See ya.

HELEN
     Yeah.

And they walk their separate ways.


11.     INT.  ALLEN'S APARTMENT - EVENING.          11.

ALLEN drops his stuff.

He takes a shower.

He lies down.

He glances at a book of poetry.  CLOSE ON the jacket photo
of the author and accompanying brief bio (i.e. "Nominated
for the PEN/Faulkner Prize for poetry, Helen Jordan has
taught at Harvard, Yale…")

He leans his head against the wall, listens to HELEN making
love to somebody next door: "Oh, Helen! Helen! Helen!" etc.
He removes his ear from the wall, sits on the bed, a phone
book beside him.

He starts flipping randomly through the phone book.  He
turns to a page.  He dials a number from the book.  No
answer.  He sighs.  Tries to next number down.  A man picks
up.  ALLEN hangs up immediately.  He dials again.  A
beautiful-sounding WOMAN picks up.

ALLEN
     Hello, is this Claire?

WOMAN (V.O.)
Who is this?

ALLEN hangs up.  He buries his head in his hands.


12.     INT.  TRISH'S PLACE - DAY.                    12.

JOY sits in the kitchen with her sister TRISH, who is doing
her nails.  Trish's baby CHLOE lies in JOY'S lap.  JUANITA
the cleaning woman cleans up in the b.g.  The family dog
KOOKI teethes on a bone.

Cute little TIMMY appears, in a Robocop-style outfit.

TRISH
     Oh, Timmy!  Look who's here!

TIMMY
(aiming a laser at JOY)
     Die, Aunt Joy! Die!

TRISH
     Timmy!

She tries to go after him, but he has already run off.

JOY
     Oh, leave him alone, Trish.
     He's just going through a phase.

TRISH
     Oh, I know, but…

JOY
(trying to make light)
     It's okay. I'm strong enough.

JOY suddenly bursts into tears.

TRISH
     Oh, Joy, Joy. What's the matter?

JOY
     I don't know what it is,
     but I feel there's so much
     hostility directed at me.

TRISH
     Did another guy dump you?

JOY
     No! I…oh, I feel horrible.

TRISH
     Aww. Timmy didn't mean it.

JOY
     I'm sorry.  I-I'm just overworked.

TRISH
     It's okay.  Because now maybe
     you'll listen to me.

JOY
     What?

A weighty pause.

TRISH
     You've got to eat red meat.

JOY
     Oh, Trish…

TRISH
     Oh, I knew that's how you'd react,
     but it's true. I've been watching you
     and, well… My doctor says just
     once a month…

JOY
     I know…

TRISH
     Really. It's the best thing for
     the skin. It'll clear it all up.

JOY
     What's wrong with my skin?

TRISH
     It's fine now, but in another
     few years… Please, Joy.
     I'm speaking for your own good.

JOY
     Oh, I know. Thanks.

A tender moment: TRISH and JOY hold hands.

JOY
     I'm so happy.

TRISH
     Are you really?

JOY
     Being around you and the kids…

TRISH
     Oh… And I'm so happy you're happy.
     'Cause all this time I've been
     thinking you were so miserable.

JOY
     Oh, Trish! That's too funny,
     when I couldn't be happier.

TRISH
     It's just, what with your
     music career never really…

JOY
     My career's fine!

TRISH
     Oh, I know, it will be!
     I just know it! And then you'll
     move out of Mom and Dad's…

JOY
     Real soon!

TRISH
     And you'll meet Mr. Right!

JOY
     Oh, I will. Already I feel
     I'm off to a fresh start!

TRISH
     That's right. Just because
     you've hit 30, doesn't mean you
     can't be fresh anymore.

JOY
     That's right.

Pause.

TRISH
     You know, Joy, I've never told you
     this before, but now that we're
     older, and I feel so bonded to you,
     well…the truth is – oh, I know this
     sounds horrible, but I feel I have to
     be fully open with you, get beyond
     all the old barriers, sibling nonsense –
     well, the truth is I always thought
     you would never amount to much. That
     you'd end up alone, without a career
     or anything. Really, it's what we all
     thought. Mom, Dad, Helen…everyone…
     I'd always prayed we'd all be wrong,
     but you had always seemed to…doomed
     to failure. But now I see, it's not true.
     There is a glimmer of hope for you
     after all. Oh, I know I'm repeating
     myself, but, oh…
(tears well up)
     I'm so happy for you…


13.     EXT.  PARK - DAY.                              13.

It is sunny and warm.  Couples straight and gay walk hand in
hand, families picnic, beautiful people sunbathe.

BILL observes the pleasant tranquillity from atop a hill.
Suddenly he pulls out a machine gun and starts shooting at
everyone.

Bloodshed everywhere.  Then silence.

VOICE
     And how is this different?


14.     INT.  PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY.               14.

BILL sits opposed his PSYCHIATRIST, to whom the VOICE
belongs.

BILL
     I don't kill myself at the end.

PSYCHIATRIST
     Do you see this as something positive?

BILL
     Gee, I don't know.

PSYCHIATRIST
     How do you feel at the end?

BILL
     Much better. I wake up happy.
     Feeling good. But then I get very
     depressed because I'm living in reality.

PSYCHIATRIST
     And you wouldn't kill people
     in real life.

BILL
     No. I don't think so.

PSYCHIATRIST
     You don't sound so certain.

BILL
     I'm thinking about my patients.

PSYCHIATRIST
     What about them?

BILL
     My patients are ugly. Their problems
     are trite. Each one thinks he is
     unique. On a professional level they
     bore me. On a personal level I have
     no sympathy. They deserve what they get.

PSYCHIATRIST
     And what about your family?

BILL
     Trish is good to me.

PSYCHIATRIST
     But still no sex?

BILL
     No. But she's not too interested,
     either. So really there's no problem
     there, when you think about it,
     on a certain level.


15.     EXT.  CAR - DAY.                              15.

BILL is driving along.


16.     EXT.  PARK - DAY.                              16.

Reminiscent of BILL'S dream: schoolchildren are playing,
teachers supervising.  A laborer is eating lunch with a
co-worker.  A little boy is sitting alone in the shade of a
tree.

BILL pulls up to the side of the field and observes from his
parking space.

He gets back in his car.


17.     INT.  BILL'S CAR - DAY.                         17.

BILL is at the wheel again, a little tense.


18.     EXT.  MINI-MALL - DAY.                         18.

BILL pulls into the lot.  He walks into the 7-11.


19.     INT.  7-11 - DAY.                              19.

BILL picks up a Boy's Life, pays for it.


20.     EXT.  MINI-MALL - DAY.                         20.

BILL gets into the back seat of his car and sets to
masturbating.

SHOPPERS walk by with shopping carts, little children,
oblivious to the activity inside Bill's car.

Finally, BILL gets out of his car, tucks in his shirt,
tosses the scrunched-up magazine into a dumpster, returns to
his car and pulls out.


21.     INT.  BILL'S KITCHEN - EVENING.               21.

BILL comes home as Trish finishes preparing the dinner
table.  He gives her a peck on the cheek.  Their kids are
eating in the adjacent TV Room.

TRISH
     So how was work today, Hon?

BILL
     Oh, fine.

KOOKI sniffs BILL'S pants, excited.

TRISH
     Kooki, no!

BILL
     Down, Kooki!

KOOKI calms down somewhat.

BILLY ENTERS, opens the refrigerator, pours himself a soda.
He looks dejected.

BILL
     Hey, Billy! What's going on?

BILLY
     Nothing.

TRISH
     He's
(making quotation marks
with her fingers)
     "depressed."

BILL
     Is something the matter?

BILLY
     I don't wanna talk about it.

And he leaves for the TV room again.

TRISH
     Ignore him. He's just doing it for
     attention. He thinks you'll be
     impressed. As if. So anyway…
     Joy came by today.

BILL
     How's she doing?

TRISH
     Oh, God, I dunno, and frankly…
     I'm concerned. I mean, she's not
     like me. She doesn't "have it all."
     She pretends to be happy, but
     I can see right through her:
     she's miserable.

BILL
     Why do you think that is?

TRISH
     To be frank, I think she's lazy.
     She's not a go-getter, like me or
     Helen.  And she's so picky. I gave
     Damien Ross her phone number, for
     what it's worth, and Joy sounded
     interested, naturally, but…I dunno.
     I'm afraid to have to say it, but
     truly it's what I believe: she'll
     always be alone.

BILL
     We're all alone.

TRISH
     Oh, Bill. Sometimes I wonder how any
     of your patients can talk to you.

BILL
     Sometimes I wonder if they'll ever
     stop. I should tape some for you.

TRISH
     Would you? Would you really?
     So that I could listen, too?

BILL
     No.

TRISH
     You're such a tease.
     You know I wouldn't tell anyone.

BILL
     I know. 'Cause you're so secretive.

TRISH
     Well, maybe not as secretive as you.

BILL
     What secret would you like me to
     tell you?

IRISH puts her arms around BILL.

TRISH
(whispers coyly)
     Like how come no matter how much
     you treat me like shit,
     I can't help loving you even more?


22.     INT.  BILL'S BEDROOM - LATER.               22.

While TRISH puts CHLOE and TIMMY to bed, BILLY comes and
sits beside BILL on his bed.

BILLY
     Dad?

BILL
     Yes, Billy?

BILLY
     What does come mean?

BILL
     Come?

BILLY
     You know…

BILL
     Well, you know how sometimes your
     penis gets erect…well, sometimes
     it gets so excited that a sticky
     milky substance shoots out.

BILLY
     …Dickwad?

BILL
     Yes, only come can be used as a
     verb as well.
(a beat)
     Billy?

BILLY
     Yeah?

BILL
     Have you ever come?

BILLY
     Yeah…

BILL
     Now Billy, it's alright if you haven't.

BILLY
     Well, I have…

BILL
     Billy…

BILLY
     But everyone else in class had and…
     I want to come, too!

BILLY starts crying.

BILL
     Awn, now, it's okay, it's okay.
     Have you tried playing with yourself?

BILLY
     You mean…

BILL
     With your penis.

BILLY
     A little.

BILL
     How did it feel?

BILLY
     I dunno. I don't know what to do.

BILL
     Do you want me to…show you?

BILLY
     No! No! I'm not normal!

BILLY buries his head in BILL'S lap.

BILL
     Aw, Billy. Don't worry.  You're normal.
     You'll come. One day. You'll see.


23.     INT.  JOY'S PLACE - DAY.                    23.

JOY is preparing to cook a steak.  She is wearing rubber
globes.  HELEN sits with a coffee mug at the kitchen table.

HELEN
     Y'know, people were always putting
     New Jersey down. None of my friends
     can believe I live here. But that's
     because they don't get it:
     I'm living in a state of irony.

JOY
     Are you sure you don't wanna
     stay and have dinner with me?

HELEN
     I can't. I'm giving another reading/
     book-signing over at Barnes & Noble,
     and then Jamal is taking me out –
     although I promised Fabiacho…Uch.
     Everybody wants me…

The phone rings.

HELEN
     That's it, I'm going.

JOY
     Wait!

JOY picks up the phone.

JOY
     Hello?

VOICE
     Hi! How are you?

JOY
     Is this Damien?

VOICE
     Yeah!… So, uh, how are you doing?

JOY
     Oh, fine. Could you hold a second?
     Helen?

HELEN is almost out the door.

HELEN
     See ya!

JOY
     Thanks for stopping by!

HELEN leaves.

JOY
(into phone)
     Sorry. That was my sister leaving.

VOICE
     Oh. Yeah…um…yeah…

Pause.

JOY
     So, um, Trish told me you might
     be calling.

VOICE
     Yeah, well…

JOY
     Oh, I know how weird these things
     can be, but I've always had such faith
     in Trish's judgment that I thought
     why not. It's not like I've got some
     huge social life. I mean, I do have a
     social life. It's just not huge.

VOICE
     Same here.

JOY
     Oh, really? That's so nice to hear.
     Most people seem so confident…

VOICE
     Yeah…

JOY
     Or, well, you know…
     They're just real jerks.

VOICE
     Yeah…uh… What are you doing?

JOY
     Oh, I'm sorry, I'm just trying to
     thaw this steak…but it's so hard
     and… I'm sorry.

VOICE
     Oh, no. No. Don't stop. Not because of me.

JOY
     Oh, but I feel I'm being so rude.

VOICE
     No, no. Not at all.

JOY
     Thanks.

VOICE
     So…um… Are you alone now?

JOY
     Oh, yeah. Don't worry. Nobody's
     listening in. God, you're just like me.

VOICE
     What are you wearing?

JOY
     You mean, when we go out?
     Well, where do you want to go?
     I'm pretty easy to please.
     I hate getting all dressed up.


VOICE
     What are you wearing now?

JOY
     Oh, just a pair of jeans. Why?

VOICE
     Are they tight?

JOY
     Not too tight. They fit okay.
     But why do you…?

VOICE
     I don't mean the jeans.
     I mean underneath. What are you
     wearing underneath? Check.

JOY
(starts looking inside her jeans)
     Underneath? Well, but Damien,
     underneath is just…
(pauses, suddenly alarmed)
     This isn't Damien…is it?

VOICE
     Are you getting wet?
     Is your pussy all—?

JOY hangs up.


24.     INT.  ALLEN'S BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT.          24.

VOICES of neighborhood children can be heard from outside
the window.

ALLEN (the man behind the VOICE that was just on the phone
with JOY) rises to the sitting position and puts a bookmark
in the phonebook.

He notices the mess he made on the wallpaper.  The stain
looks permanent.  He covers it up with a postcard.  (There
are many other postcards already thumbtacked to the wall.)

The doorbell rings.

ALLEN rises.

ALLEN
     Who is it?

VOICES
     Your neighbor Kristina.

ALLEN opens the door, sees KRISTINA.  She is very big and
very overweight.

ALLEN
     Hey, what's up?

KRISTINA
     Did you hear what happened to Pedro?

ALLEN
     Pedro?

KRISTINA
     You know, the night doorman?

ALLEN
     Oh, yeah. What?

KRISTINA
     He was found bludgeoned to death
     in his apartment this morning.

ALLEN
     Uch.

KRISTINA
     Yeah. And supposedly his penis
     is missing.

ALLEN
     Uugh.

KRISTINA
     Yeah, well, Carla in 2B is collecting
     money for the funeral, if you feel
     like it. Apparently he had no family,
     no known friends…Gee, if I'da know…
     I mean, I did always say hi, I think.

ALLEN
     Me too, if it's the guy I'm thinking of.

Pause.

KRISTINA
     By the way, um, I've got an extra
     ticket to the play-offs tonight.
     Wanna come with me?

ALLEN
     Nah. Thanks. I got too much work.

KRISTINA
     Oh.
(a beat)
     Well, anyway, I just thought I'd
     tell you about Pedro.

ALLEN
     Thanks.

KRISTINA
     See ya.

ALLEN
     Yeah.

And he closes the door.


25.     INT.  HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT.                    25.

KRISTINA stands outside ALLEN'S door and stares at it
dejectedly.  Finally, tearing up the ticket, she walks back
to her apartment, shutting the door behind her.


26.     EXT.  FLORIDA/ARIZONA                          26.
CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX - DAY.

It is bright and sunny.


27.     INT.  CONDO - DAY.                              27.

LENNY and MONA, in their 60s, sit at the kitchen table.
There are dishes shattered on the floor.

MONA
     Oh, I feel better now.

LENNY
     Good.
(a beat)
     I'm gonna clean up.

Pause.

MONA
     I'm gonna lie down.

MONA rises, walks to her bedroom, lies down.

LENNY clears the table.

LENNY
     I'm turning on the dishwasher!

And LENNY starts vacuuming up the debris on the floor.

MONA goes to the bathroom, opens the medicine cabinet.

MONA
(calling, faux calm)
     Where's my valium?!

LENNY
     What?!

MONA
     Nevermind!
(to herself)
     Fucking asshole.

She has found a good enough valium substitute, but there are
only two pills left in the bottle.  She swallows them with a
glass of water, lies down again.

The phone rings.

MONA
(to herself)
     You answer it, Bastard.

LENNY (O.S.)
     It's Trish!

MONA picks up.

MONA
     Hi, Trish!

TRISH (V.O.)
     Hi, Mom. How are you?

MONA
     Oh, I'm fine. How are you?

TRISH (V.O.)
     Fine…

MONA
     Good.

TRISH (V.O.)
     Did you watch Leno last night?… Mom?

Pause.

MONA
(she bursts into tears)
     He's leaving me!
Your father's leaving me!

TRISH (V.O.)
     Mom, what are you talking about?

MONA
     Can you keep this secret? Top secret?

TRISH (V.O.)
     Yes, yes, of course, Mom, but –

MONA
     He says…he doesn't love me anymore.

TRISH (V.O.)
     Mom, I'm sure he doesn't mean it.

MONA
     Well, he does fucking mean it!
     He wants a divorce!

TRISH (V.O.)
     He said the word divorce?

MONA
     You don't believe me? Talk to him!
(calling)
     Lenny!

LENNY
     Yeah?!

MONA
     It's Trish! She wants to talk to you!

LENNY
(on phone)
     Yeah, Trish?

TRISH (V.O.)
     Is it true what Mom said?

LENNY
     What?

TRISH (V.O.)
     You want a divorce?

LENNY
     I never used that word.
(calling)
Mona! What are you telling the kids?

MONA comes wobbling into the room.

LENNY
(to TRISH)
     She'll call you back.
(hanging up; to MONA)
     Did I use the word divorce?

MONA
     You said you didn't want to
     live with me anymore!

LENNY
     Answer my question: did I use
     the word divorce?

MONA
     You said you didn't love me anymore!

LENNY
     Did I say divorce?!

MONA
     …No.

LENNY
     Good. I just want that much clear.
     Now sit down now next to me.

Pause.  The phone rings.

MONA
     Leave it. The machine'll get it.
     It's probably Joy.

LENNY
     What if it's Helen?

JOY
(on the machine)
     Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. It's Joy.
     Just called to say hi, but I guess
     you're out having a good time.
     Oh, well. I guess I'll talk to you
     tomorrow then. Okay. Bye.

Pause.

MONA
     Lenny?

LENNY
     Yeah?

MONA
     Why?

LENNY
     I dunno. I just want to be alone.

MONA
     But I can let you be alone more,
     if that's what you want.

LENNY
     Look: Things change… People change…
     Whatever. I want out.

Pause.

MONA
     It's Diane.

LENNY
     Diane?

MONA
     You're in love with Diane Freed.

LENNY
     Get outta here.

MONA
     Well, you're in love with someone.
     Someone younger, probably.

LENNY
     Wrong.

MONA
     Lenny, it's okay. I'm not dumb.
     These things happen. I'll get over it.
     I just wish you had done this twenty
     years ago. Now I'll have to get
     another fucking face-lift.

Pause.

LENNY
     I'm in love with no one else.

MONA
     No one?

LENNY
     No one.

MONA
     Okay, then.
(a beat)
     Schmuck.


28.     INT.  PHONE SALES OFFICE - DAY.               28.

The CAMERA DOLLIES across a maze of carrels, finally landing
on JOY, at work as a telephone sales operator.

JOY
(on phone)
     Hi!  Is this Mrs. Mammangakis?…
     Hi!  I'm calling from UniCard
     of America because you've been
     such a good customer that—.

JOY dials the number of the next name on the list, and the
next.  Everyone hangs up on her.  Until:


29.     INT.  ALLEN'S PLACE - DAY.                    29.

ALLEN is lying in bed.  The phone rings.  He picks it up.

ALLEN
     Hello?

JOY
     Hello, is this Mr. Mellencamp?

ALLEN
     Yes.

JOY
     Hi! I'm calling from UniCard of
     America because you've been
     such a good–.

ALLEN
     Do I know you?

JOY
     I'm sorry, I don't think so.
     But perhaps you're familiar with out—.

ALLEN hangs up.  But then, for a moment, he ponders the
familiarity of her voice.

Ditto JOY.  She decides to dial him again.  ALLEN answers,
but says nothing.  They both hang on, listening to each
other's silence, then hang up.


30.     EXT.  JOY'S PLACE - EVENING.                    30.

JOY can be heard singing and playing her guitar.


31.     INT.  JOY'S PLACE - EVENING.                    31.

JOY, sitting on her bed, finishes her melancholy Joni
Mitchell-like song.  A display of macrame objects d'art
adorns the wall.

The phone rings.  She answers it.

JOY
     Hello?

BERMAN (V.O.)
     Hello. This is Detective Berman from
     the County Police Department. I'd
     like to speak with a Ms. Joy Jordan?

JOY
     This is she.


32.     INT.  STUART'S PLACE - EVENING.               32.

POLICEMEN, a CORONER, a SUPER, ETC. AL. Busy themselves
while STUART's body is being removed.  BERMAN holds Stuart's
suicide note ("Dear Joy, I can't live without you. Love,
Stuart.  P.S. The ashtray is yours.") in a baggie in his
hand.

BERMAN
     I'm sorry to disturb you,
     Ms. Jordan, but I'm afraid
     I have some bad news for you…

FADE TO BLACK.


33.     EXT.  OFFICE BUILDING COMPLEX - DAY.          33.

A bright, cheerful day.  The parking lot is full.


34.     JOY'S OFFICE - DAY.                         34.

JOY looks over at a corner desk where a woman is working the
phones and starts crying.  Her neighbor, NANCY, hearing the
sniffling, pauses in the midst of her work.

NANCY
     What's the matter, Joy?

JOY
     Stuart's dead!

NANCY
     Stuart…?

JOY
     Yes!

Pause.

NANCY
     Who's Stuart?

JOY
     You know, the guy who used to
     sit over at the corner there?

NANCY
     You mean where Pam is sitting?

JOY
     Yes.

NANCY
     Was he kind of tall and
     a little hunched?

JOY
     No, he was…well…shortish, squarish…

NANCY
     Oh, Joy. I'm not sure.
     Did he work here long?

NANCY calls across to another neighbor, KAY.

NANCY
     Kay, do you remember a guy
     named Stuart who used to work here
     over where Pam is now?

KAY
     No. Why? What happened?

NANCY
     He died.

KAY
     Huh. Now which one was he?

NANCY
     I'm not sure. May be Tom knows. Tom?

Co-worker TOM, who has been listening in, swivels over from
the other side.

TOM
     Sorry, Nancy, I don't. I mean,
     I do vaguely remember some guy
     who worked over there – I think…
     but I'm not really sure.

KAY
     How did he die anyway?

NANCY
     Yeah, how did he die, Joy?

JOY's phone rings.  She picks up.

JOY
     Sales, can I help you?

VOICE
     Is this Joy Jordan?

JOY
     Yes.

VOICE
     This is Stuart's mother.
(a beat)
     I hope you fucking rot in hell.

The VOICE hangs up.

TOM
     Hey, Joy. Was he kind of Latino-
     looking and a little acne-scarred?

NANCY
     Yeah, you know, like Edward James Olmos?

JOY
(a beat)
     Yeah. Sure. That's him.

TOM
     I knew it.

NANCY, KAY, and TOM continue discussing and disputing
STUART's identity.


35.     INT.  HAPPY'S RESTAURANT - DAY.               35.

HELEN and TRISH sit together.

HELEN
(picking at her food)
     Uch. I don't know why I suggested
     this place. Joy recommended it…

TRISH
     Well, at least we're together.
     I never get to see you,
     you're so busy.

HELEN
     No, you're so busy.

TRISH
     No, you are…

HELEN
     Well, I guess I am.

TRISH
     Me too.

HELEN
     In fact, if I have to do one more
     interview…

TRISH
     I guess it's hard, all this success.

HELEN
     It's just I'm so tired of…of being
     admired all the time. All these men…
     I mean, they're all beautiful,
     artistic minds, great sex, the whole
     package…but hollow, you know what
     I mean? I feel nobody's really honest
     with me. Nobody wants me for me.

TRISH
     They're not family.

HELEN
     Oh, Trish. If only I had your
     husband, kids, carpool.

TRISH
     Well, I may "have it all," but
     sometimes I wonder what my life
     would have been like if I'd
     actually tried to write a novel.

HELEN
     Oh, I'm sure it would have been good.

TRISH
     Maybe I will write one.

HELEN
     Oh, you should… Just try…

Pause.

TRISH
     No, I don't need that kind of success.

HELEN
     Uch, listen to us. We who have
     everything while Joy…
     What does she have?

TRISH
     You're right. And she's just getting older.

HELEN
     Last night she called – I was
     in bed with Vilmos – no, Huraki –
     and she was in tears. She told me
     she'd quit her job…

TRISH
     Oh, but…but that's her lifeline!

HELEN
     She said she wanted to "change"
     her life. Do "good" work with
     the poor, the needy…

TRISH
     I don't get it.

HELEN
     Don't even try. She understand
     she already is good.
     She doesn't need to do good.

TRISH
     And what about her music career?

HELEN
     I don't know, but don't hold your
     breath. Anyway, listen. This is all
     top secret. She doesn't want anyone
     to know.

TRISH
     Oh.
(a beat)
     But she told you.

HELEN
     She felt she could trust me.

TRISH
     'Cause I always thought I was
     someone she could confide in.

A BUSBOY comes by, refills their water glasses, leaves.

TRISH
     Did you speak to Mom?

HELEN
     You mean about the split-up?

TRISH
     Oh. I-I thought it was top secret.

HELEN
     Just for Joy. Sensitive Joy.
     Everyone else knows.

TRISH
     Oh.

A WAITER comes by.

WAITER
     Can I help you with anything else?

HELEN
     Oh, no thanks.

The WAITER leaves the check, clears the plates, goes off.
TRISH picks up the check, looks at it.

HELEN
     Thanks for lunch. I really
     enjoyed this.


36.     EXT.  PARK - DAY.                              36.

A little league gave is in progress.  11-year-old JOHNNY is
at bat.  There is a hush.  Bases are loaded.  BILLY
encourages him from the sidelines

BILLY
     You can do it, Johnny!

JOE, JOHNNY's father and the team's coach, mutters to
himself, tense.

JOE
     Don't fuck up, Johnny.

BILL observes JOHNNY's TEAMMATES muttering to themselves.

TEAMMATE #1
     I can't believe he's up at bat now.

TEAMMATE #2
     I swear I'm not playing Little League
     next year if he's on the team.

RONALD FARBER, the biggest and perhaps dumbest of the
teammates, joins in.

RONALD
     Let's beat him up afterwards.

JOHNNY concentrates.  The pitcher throws the ball
and…STRIKE!

BILLY
     C'mon Johnny!

JOE
     My kid is a fucking spaz.

TEAMMATE #2
     Do we have to stay and watch this?

Strike two.

BILLY
     Concentrate, Johnny! You can do it!

JOE
     You hit the fucking ball or
     I'm gonna smash your fucking face in.

PARENT #1
(to BILL)
     You know, this really is unfair
     to the other kids.

Strike three.


37.     INT.  MCDONALD'S - DAY.                         37.

While BILLY and JOHNNY play video games, BILL and JOE eat at
a table.

JOE
     Bill, I dunno. Maybe I should
     talk to you. You're a specialist
     in these things, aren't you?

BILL
     Well, I don't know. That depends…

JOE
     Look, my son's a fag.
     I'm not blind to these things.

BILL
     How come you're so sure he's…gay?

JOE
     What, are you kidding?

BILL
     Well, it's just sometimes…appearances
     can be deceiving. And besides. Even
     if you're right. There's not much
     you can do, is there?

Pause.

JOE
     What do you think would happen if
     I got him a professional…you know…

BILL
     A professional?

JOE
     Hooker. You know, the kind that
     can teach things…first-timers,
     you know…break him in.

BILL
     But Joe, he's 11.

JOE
     You're right, you're right.
     It's too late. He is…what he is.
     Forget I said anything.

BILL
     Maybe you ought to discuss it with Betty.

JOE
     I can't. I can't talk to her.

BILL
     Hmm. That's a problem.

JOE
     Things aren't too good between us…

BILL
     Not too good.

JOE
     No.

Pause.

BILL
     Are you…?

JOE
     No.
(a beat)
     She's a dyke.

BILLY and JOHNNY approach.

BILLY
     Dad, can Johnny sleep over tonight?

BILL
     Well, that's up to Joe here.

JOE
(pause)
     Sure. Whatever.

JOHNNY AND BILLY
     Yeah!!!

JOHNNY and BILLY hold each other as they jump for joy.

JOE
(to himself)
     Like girls.


38.     EXT.  BILL'S PLACE - NIGHT.                    38.

The lights are on.  The TV is on.

The family can be heard laughing and playing some board
game.


39.     INT.  BILL'S PLACE - NIGHT.                    39.

BILL is preparing hot fudge sundaes.  He mixes some powdered
drugs into the fudge before pouring it onto the ice cream.

He brings a tray loaded with bowls of sundaes into the TV
room.

BILL
     Come and get it!

TRISH
     Oh, Bill. You shouldn't have.

BILL
     Here, take. You only live once.

Everyone grabs a bowl, except JOHNNY.

BILL
     Aren't you having, Johnny?

JOHNNY
     No, thank you, Dr. Maplewood.

BILLY
     Johnny hates chocolate fudge.

BILL
     Well, is there something
     you'd like instead?

JOHNNY
     No, thank you.

BILL
     What about to drink?

TRISH
     Oh, leave him alone. He's fine.

BILL
     No, but there must be something…

JOHNNY
     Do you have any grape Hi C?

BILL
     Do we, Trish?

TRISH
     I'm afraid not.

BILL
     I could go pick some up.

TRISH
     Bill, don't be silly. He doesn't
     need anything. It's late.

JOHNNY
     Do you have any tuna salad?

BILL
     Would you like a sandwich?

JOHNNY
     Yes, please.

BILL
     Coming right up!

TRISH
     I'm going to bed, Bill.

BILL
     I'll be there soon.

TRISH
     Look at that Timmy, can hardly
     keep his eyes open. Come on, Timmy.
(to BILLY and JOHNNY)
     You boys, don't stay up to late!

TRISH shuffles off with little CHLOE and TIMMY.

BILL returns to the kitchen, hastily fixes a tuna sandwich,
spiking it with gobs of his powder.

BILL brings the sandwich in to JOHNNY.  He finds BILLY
already fallen asleep.

BILL
     Here we are!

JOHNNY
     Thanks, Dr. Maplewood.

BILL
     What happened to Billy?

JOHNNY
     I don't know. I guess
     he just conked out.

JOHNNY is glued to the TV. He doesn't touch the tuna
sandwich.

BILL
     Aren't you going to eat the sandwich?

JOHNNY
     In a minute.

BILL
     Take your time.

BILL waits.

JOHNNY
     Dr. Maplewood, would it be
     alright if I ate this tomorrow?

BILL
(not losing his self-control)
     Well, sure, but I don't know if
     it's taste any good tomorrow.

JOHNNY examines the sandwich.  He turns back to the TV.
Just when all seems lost, however, he takes a bite.

BILL
     How is it?

JOHNNY
     Actually, it's really good.

BILL
     Enjoy it.

BILL then rises, checks in on TRISH, CHLOE, and TIMMY: they
are all sound asleep.

BILL pauses in the hallway to look at a family portrait.
Then he returns to the TV room.

BILL
(testing)
     Johnny? Johnny?

But JOHNNY too is now sound asleep.  BILL takes away the
unfinished tuna sandwich and plate and brings them into the
kitchen.  He dumps the tuna remains into the garbage, puts
the plate into the dishwasher, turns it on.

BILL lifts BILLY up and carries him off to bed.  He tucks
him in.

BILL returns to the TV room, where JOHNNY lies.  He places
him on the couch, then stands hovering over him.

The TV is left on.


40.     EXT.  MAPLEWOOD HOME - MORNING.               40.

The gardener is mowing the lawn.  A postman drops off the
mail.  Little children play ball.


41. INT.  MAPLEWOOD HOME - MORNING.               41.

TIMMY, BILLY, and JOHNNY are in the TV room watching TV.

TRISH snuggles in bed next to BILL.  They are very
kissy-kissy.

TRISH
     Oh, Honey. I feel so good now.

BILL
     Me too.

TRISH
     I haven't slept so well in so long.

BILL
     Me neither.

TRISH
     It's weird. I feel as if we… Bill,
     did we? I mean, did you… Did I…?

BILL
     Yes.

Pause.

TRISH
     I don't remember…

BILL
     That's okay. It doesn't matter.

TRISH
     It matters.

BILL
     Forget about it.

TRISH
     Okay.
(a beat)
     It's funny, 'cause I remember
     I was dreaming and you were there…
     and Billy…and Timmy and Chloe…
     and Johnny Grasso…

BILL
     Oh?

TRISH
     I can't really remember anything more,
     except…I don't know.  Oh, Bill.
     Please don't get mad at me. I know
     you hate it when I ask, but…
     Do you still?

BILL
     Oh.

TRISH
     Oh.

Pause.

BILL
     Yes. Very very much.

TRISH
     Oh, Bill, and I do too!
     I'm sorry I need to keep being
     reminded, it's just…

BILL
     I know.

TRISH
     And we haven't been…

BILL
     I know. And it's my fault.

TRISH
     My fault.

BILL
     Trish, I—.

TRISH
     I know.

BILL
     No, I…I—.

Just when things get hot and heavy, CHLOE starts screaming
o.s.

Pause.

TRISH
(kisses him)
     Later.

She rises and leaves the room.


42.     INT.  BILL'S KITCHEN - DAY.                    42.

JOHNNY sits at the table with the funnies.  BILL is sipping
coffee, reading the paper.

TIMMY runs around in the b.g.

BILL
     Where's Billy?

JOHNNY
     Watching TV.

BILL
     How come you're not playing together?

JOHNNY
     I don't know. Billy just said
     he didn't feel like it.
(a beat)
     Dr. Maplewood?

BILL
     Yes?

JOHNNY
     Can you drive me home now?

BILL
     Well, sure, but…are you
     having a good time?

JOHNNY
     I'm not feeling so well.

BILL
     What's the matter?

JOHNNY
     I don't know. I think—.

He throws up on the funnies.


43.     INT.  CAR - DAY.                              43.

BILL is driving JOHNNY home.

JOHNNY
     Dr. Maplewood?

BILL
     Yes, Johnny?

JOHNNY
     I'm sorry I threw up.

BILL
     Don't worry about it.

JOHNNY
     'Cause I really had a good time.

BILL
     Good. Billy did too. We all did.

BILL puts his arm around him affectionately.  JOHNNY, very
sleepy, leans in close against him.

JOHNNY
     Dr. Maplewood?

BILL
     Yes, Johnny?

JOHNNY
     You're so cool.

And he falls asleep, his head sinking into BILL'S lap.

A string of saliva drips from JOHNNY's lips onto BILL's
pants.


44.     EXT.  MAPLEWOOD HOME - NIGHT.               44.

The lights are on.  The TV is on.


45.     INT.  MAPLEWOOD HOME - TV ROOM - LATER.     45.

BILLY joins BILL on the sofa.  KOOKI is humping a chair
across from them.

BILLY
     Dad?

BILL
     Yes, Billy?

BILLY
     I was kind of wondering.

BILL
     Yeah?

Pause.

BILLY
     Nothing.

Pause.

BILL
     Did you have a good time with Johnny?

BILLY
     It was okay. He's a little girlish though.

BILL
     Oh. Yeah.

Pause.

BILLY
     Dad. Do you know how many
     inches your penis is?

Pause.

BILL
     I never measured.

BILLY
     Ronald Farber said his penis is
     twelve inches long. Do you
     think that's possible?

BILL
     What Ronald Farber doesn't know
     is that it's not length, but
     width that matters.

Pause.

BILLY
     Why?

BILL
     Things get a little more…tense.

Pause.

BILLY
     What do you mean…tense?

Pause.

BILL
     Have you been…practicing?

BILLY
     …Yeah. But it's no use. Nothing comes.

BILL
     You have to be patient. Your friend
     Ronald Farber, I can assure you,
     is full of crap.

BILLY
     Yeah. I bet yours is
     a lot wider and longer.

Pause.

BILL
     Do you want me to measure?

BILLY
     Nah, that's okay.

BILLY smiles, leans affectionately against his father.


46.     INT.  ESL OFFICE - DAY.                         46.

Through the glass door a group of newly-arrived immigrants
can be seen walking by.

SUPERVISOR looks JOY over.

SUPERVISOR
     You've come at a god time.
     The place is in turmoil now.
     Everyone's preparing to strike.

JOY
     W-why are they going to strike?

SUPERVISOR
     I can't tell you the half of it:
     the deceit, the corruption. The union
     wants to close down the school.
     They don't care about these poor
     immigrants. It's heartbreaking.
     Now I believe in unions, I'm sensitive
     to their needs, I cried at "The Grapes
     of Wrath", I sing to Woody Guthrie.
     But that was another time, another
     place. Today unions are just a new
     kind of corporation. It's tragic, but
     believe me, those teachers making
     sacrifices for the union, well, the
     union's not going to make any
     sacrifices for them. Those union
     leaders, they go home with pay-checks,
     the teachers end up with nothing.
     Now we need people who can be dedicated,
     who aren't in it just for the money.
     Because this job takes courage.
     Do you know what some of these
     refugees have endured? Concentration
     camps. And now their dream of coming
     to America is realized, and this
     union doesn't care. It's all about
     greed. Selfishness. Now Joy, can I
     count on you?

JOY
     O-of course…I want to do the right,
     um, thing…I mean, I believe in, um,
     you know…being counted on…

SUPERVISOR
     Do you know what these strikers are?
     Spoiled brats. Trust-funded artistes.
     They don't know the meaning of work,
     of giving… But just remember, if you
     hear the word "benefits," don't listen.


47.     EXT.  ESL SCHOOL - DAY.                         47.

PICKETERS march along the sidewalk. JOY approaches and
hesitates.

PICKETERS
(chanting)
     Don't cross the line!
     Don't cross the line!

JOY
     You know, there are some people
     in real need in there.

PICKETER #1
     Fucking management is in there.

JOY
     But what about the refugees?

PICKETER #2
     What about my benefits?

JOY
     I'm sorry. I think you're
     making a terrible mistake.

As she crosses the picket line they shout epithets at her.
Someone throws an egg at her.  It cracks against her head.
She runs inside.


48.     INT.  ELEVATOR - DAY.                         48.

Strangers look askance at JOY.  When the elevator arrives at
her floor she gets out, relieved.


49.     INT.  ESL SCHOOL TEACHERS LOUNGE - DAY.     49.

Administrators welcome JOY, handing out general information.
The air is festive.

JOY finds the other TEACHERS cleaning tomatoes and egg off
their clothes.  RHONDA, a teacher, pulls her aside towards
the window from which the strikers can be seen.

RHONDA
     It's so sad. I mean, it really is
     pathetic. Such losers. Really,
     I feel sorry for them.

There is a slight commotion across the room.  TEACHER #1 is
upset, crying a little.  TEACHER #2 comforts her.

TEACHER #1
     I'm sorry… It's nothing… Sorry…

TEACHER #2
     It's okay.

TEACHER #1
     It's just…well…

TEACHER #2
     What is it? What happened?

TEACHER #1
     …They called me a scab.

TEACHER #2
     You're not a scab.
     You're a strike-breaker.

The bell rings.


50.     INT.  CLASSROOM - DAY.                         50.

JOY enters.  The STUDENTS do not have welcoming faces.

JOY
     Good morning. My name is Joy Jordan.

She writes her name on the blackboard.

JOY
     I am your new teacher. Now.

JOY is about to do roll-call when:

STUDENT #1

     You are scab.

STUDENT #2
     Where Marsha?

JOY
     Marsha? Well, Marsha…er…

STUDENT #3
     We want Marsha.

The STUDENTS start changing, "We want Marsha!"  One student,
however, does not join in.  He shouts at his classmates:

BORIS
(in Russian)
     Quiet!

They listen to him.

BORIS
(to JOY)
     Please.

JOY
     …I'm not a scab.
     I'm a strike-breaker.


51.     INT.  HELEN'S PLACE - DAY.                    51.

Intensity grips HELEN as she works on a poem at her desk.
She rises, as if in pain, and starts pacing.  Strange sounds
emanate from her mouth.  She pounds a fist against her head.
Finally she leaps into bed, thrashing about as if possessed.

HELEN
     I'm no good! I'm no good!
     I am nothing! Nothing! Zero!…

The telephone rings.

HELEN
     Hello?


52.     INT.  ALLEN'S OFFICE - DAY.                    52.

ALLEN is on the other end of the line.  His breathing is
heavy, low, constrained.  He is sweating.

HELEN (V.O.)
     …Hello?

ALLEN
(voice disguised)
     I know who you are and you are nothing.
     You think you are fucking something,
     but you are fucking nothing.  You are
     empty.  You are zero.  You are a black
     hole, and I am going to fuck you so bad
     you're gonna be coming out of your ears.

Pause.

HELEN (V.O.)
     …Richard?

ALLEN hangs up.


53.     INT.  HELEN'S PLACE - DAY.                    53.

HELEN presses *69.

CUT BACK AND FORTH between HELEN and ALLEN.

ALLEN picks up.

ALLEN
     Data Resources.

HELEN
     Who are you?

ALLEN hangs up.  He is shaking, sweating profusely.

A pretty young SECRETARY walks by outside his glass door and
smiles.  He smiles back, weakly.

The phone rings again.  ALLEN resists answering it until he
hears his answering service pick up.

ALLEN
     What do you want?

Pause.

HELEN
     I want you to fuck me.

Pause.

ALLEN
     I…um…I don't think I can do that…
     I mean…I don't think I can do that.
(a beat; a CO-WORKER
is approaching)
     I gotta go.

HELEN
     Call me tomorrow.

ALLEN
     …Okay.

ALLEN hangs up.  The CO-WORKER appears.

CO-WORKER
     Hey, you see the play-offs last night?

ALLEN
(smiling/joking)
     Yeah, pretty good! Pretty good!


54.     EXT.  LIQUOR STORE - EVENING.               54.

ALLEN hurries inside.


55.     INT.  LIQUOR STORE - EVENING.               55.

ALLEN buys some whiskey.


56.     EXT.  HELEN AND ALLEN'S APT. COMPLEX -          56.
EVENING.

ALLEN bumps slightly over the curb as he pulls into the
parking lot.


57.     INT.  HELEN AND ALLEN'S APT. COMPLEX -          57.
LOBBY - EVENING.

ALLEN goes to the elevator, sees HELEN waiting.  As usual,
she pays him no attention.  ALLEN smiles.

ALLEN
     How's it going?

HELEN
     Okay.

The elevator arrives and they step inside.


58.     INT.  ELEVATOR - EVENING.                    58.

HELEN and ALLEN stand and say nothing during the ride, like
before.


59.     INT.  HALLWAY - EVENING.                    59.

The elevator doors open and HELEN and ALLEN come out,
walking their separate ways.

ALLEN
     See ya.

HELEN
     Yeah.

KRISTINA'S POV of ALLEN unlocking and entering his
apartment.  The view is distorted.

CLOSE ON KRISTINA in her apartment, staring through the
peephole.  She takes her eyes away and covers them with her
hand, overcome.


60.     EXT.  HELEN AND ALLEN'S APT. COMPLEX -          60.
HELEN'S PLACE - LATER.

HELEN and her lover JAMAL's silhouettes can be seen going at
it next door to ALLEN.


61.     INT.  ALLEN'S PLACE - THAT MOMENT.          61.

ALLEN, surrounded by a couple of empty liquor bottles, is
studying a Playboy centerfold.  Faint but distinct sounds of
HELEN making love with someone.

The door buzzes.  He puts down the magazine, rises
unsteadily, and walks to the door.

ALLEN
     Who is it?

KRISTINA (O.S.)
     It's me. Kristina.

ALLEN opens the door.

KRISTINA
     Hey, how's it going?

ALLEN
     Okay.

KRISTINA
     I got some more info on Pedro.

ALLEN
     Pedro?

KRISTINA
     You know…the, uh—.

ALLEN
     Oh, yeah. What?

KRISTINA
     Well, um…
(sees ALLEN tottering)
     Say, uh, are you alright?

ALLEN
     No.

KRISTINA
     Here.

KRISTINA helps ALLEN back inside, sets him down on his bed.

ALLEN
     …Pussy… Need pussy…

ALLEN passes out.

KRISTINA goes to the door and locks it.  She turns out the
light.  Then she sits down and just stares at ALLEN,
pondering his face and body.

Finally, KRISTINA bends down and unbuttons his top a little.
She leans her head against ALLEN, half lying down beside
him.

Suddenly ALLEN awakens, rises, and rushes off to the
bathroom.  He throws up o.s.  Pause.  When he reappears he
sees KRISTINA standing by the bed.

ALLEN
     What the fuck are you doing here?

KRISTINA is too petrified to speak.

ALLEN
     Get out!

KRISTINA leaves.


62.     EXT.  FLORIDA/ARIZONA REAL ESTATE           62.
OFFICE -     DAY.

Sunny.  Well-tended landscaping.  Attractive parking lot.


63.     INT.  FLORIDA/ARIZONA REAL ESTATE               63.
OFFICE - DAY.

MONA is sitting in the waiting room when, ANN, a young and
comely broker, appears.

ANN
     Hi. Ann Chambeau.

MONA
     Mona Jordan.

ANN
     Wonderful.
(shaking hands with MONA.)
     Come this way. I'm sorry to have
     kept you waiting so long.

ANN escorts MONA to her office.  They sit down.

ANN
     Can I get you some tea? coffee?

MONA
     No, thank you.

ANN
     Okay. Now then. How can I help you?

MONA
     You said there might be something
     available over in Elysian Fields?

ANN
     Actually, there are several places
     we can see there. But first I need
     a little information.
(starts typing into her computer.)
     Now, you're looking for a one?
     two? three-bedroom?

MONA
     Three.

ANN
     Wonderful. Is this then for you
     and your husband?

MONA
     No.

ANN
     Just for yourself then?

MONA
     Yes.

ANN
     No children?

MONA
     My children are grown.

ANN
     No pets?

MONA
     No.

ANN
     So really just you alone then
     all by yourself?

MONA
     Yes.

ANN
     Wonderful.

ANN resumes interfacing with the computer.

Suddenly MONA starts crying. Soon ANN looks up from her
terminal.

ANN
     Mrs. Jordan? Is something the matter?

MONA nods yes and no.  Finally:

MONA
     My husband is leaving me.

ANN
     Oh, I'm so sorry.

ANN reaches her hand out in a vague display of support and
affection.

ANN
     You know, we have a lot of divorcees
     in Phase IV. Would you like to see
     something there, perhaps a bit smaller?

MONA
     Who said I was getting divorced?


64.     EXT.  ELYSIAN FIELDS - DAY.                    64.

ANN drives MONA through this scenic luxury village.  They
pause at a security checkpoint before looking for a spot in
the parking lot.

Easy Listening or Classical Lite is on the car radio.

ANN (V.O.)
     You know, I'm a divorcee.

MONA (V.O.)
     Oh?

ANN (V.O.)
     I live in Phase IV.


65.     INT.  ANN'S CAR - DAY.                         65.

MONA turns to ANNE as she pulls into a spot.

MONA
     I am so sorry.

ANN
     Mrs. Jordan?

MONA
     Mona.

ANN
     Mona. That's a beautiful name.

MONA
     Er…thank you.

ANN
     How long were you married?

MONA
     Forty years.

Pause.

ANN
     You know, Mona, I think we have a lot
     in common. More than you realize. See,
     I know what you're going through.
     I've been there. But I'd like to share
     a little secret with you: Divorce was
     the best thing that ever happened to me.

ANNE reaches out and this time touches MONA, gives her a
squeeze.

ANN
     Really.


66.     INT.  CONDO LOBBY - DAY.                    66.

ANN and MONA walk across the expensively decorated space.
It is empty except for an OLD LADY with a walker tottering
by.

ANN
(whispering discreetly)
     Don't worry. She's the exception to
     the rule. Most everyone here is
     much more youthful.


67.     INT.  CONDO HALLWAY - DAY.                    67.

ANN leads MONA towards the door of the place for sale.  They
pass     by a vase of flowers resting in an offset little
alcove.

While ANN searches for the right set of keys, a MAID
approaches with fresh flowers and a plastic garbage bag.
She dumps the old flowers in the bag and replaces them with
new ones.

ANN
     See how they change the flowers
     every day. They don't wait for
     things to go bad and rot here.


68.     INT.  CONDO - DAY.                              68.

ANN stands to the side while MONA wanders around.  The place
is bright and sunny.  A lot of mirrors and glass…

In each room she enters MONA sees her reflection.

ANN
     It was finished just a year and a half
     ago and they've really hardly spent
     any time here. Supposedly the third
     bathroom's never even been used.
     But I've flushed it, so I know it works.

MONA stands by the windows, looking out.

ANN
     The views are spectacular, of course.
     But what's great is you can see
     the whole world and at the same time
     feel entirely alone. It's kind of a
     double bonus: you get the solitude
     you need for reflection and
     soul-searching and the thrill of
     being "top of the heap."

MONA looks at a portrait of a couple hanging in the foyer.
The husband has been torn out of it, just as he has been
from all the other photographs lying around.

ANN
     Now they're asking 800. But I know
     I can definitely get it down to 650.
     I know this couple. They're also in
     the middle of The Big D. He needs to
     liquidate fast.

Pause.

MONA
     I'll take it.

ANN
     Wonderful!


69.     EXT.  MONA AND LENNY'S APARTMENT               69.
COMPLEX - DAY.

LENNY lies on a chaise lounge, alone by the poolside.
DIANE, perhaps slightly younger than MONA, approaches.

DIANE
     Hi, Lenny. Mind if I join you?

LENNY
     No.

DIANE arranges herself in a chair beside him.

DIANE
     How's Mona?

LENNY
     Fine.

DIANE
     Inside on such a beautiful day?

LENNY
     I dunno.

DIANE
     Whadya mean you dunno?

LENNY
     I dunno.

DIANE
     Eh. Whatever.
(a beat.)
     So how are your girls doing?

LENNY
     Fine, I guess.

DIANE
     And the grandchildren?
     Coming to visit anytime soon?

LENNY
     I dunno.

Pause.

DIANE
     It's good to have a family together.
     A close family…I know. And you know
     how I know. 'Cause you know I know
     what it's like when things aren't…
     together. When there is pain and
     loss and…separation. You know how
     I understand these things.
(a beat.)
     Lenny, I just think you should know;
     I heard about you and Mona.

LENNY
     What?

DIANE
     About your…getting divorced.
     I'm very sorry.

LENNY
     We're not getting divorced.

DIANE
     Divorced, separated, whatever.
     It doesn't matter. You're alone now.

Two beautiful young women come to the pool and settle
themselves down opposite.

LENNY looks at them.  He closes his eyes and turns away.

DIANE
     Anyway, if you ever need someone
     to talk to, I want you to know.
     I'm here. And I care.


JOHNNY'S POV OF JOE: pulling out of the driveway.  Off to
work.

70.     INT.  JOHNNY'S HOME - MORNING.               70.

Pulling up his pajama pants, JOHNNY rises from the toilet
and turns to look at the bowl.

He leaves the bathroom without flushing the toilet.

He walks into his parents' bedroom.  BETTY is walking around
naked, getting dressed.

JOHNNY
     Mom?

BETTY
     Yeah?

JOHNNY
     There's blood in my BM.
(BETTY freezes.)
     Can I stay home from school today?


71.     INT.  JOHNNY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY.          71.

A DETECTIVE is gently interrogating JOHNNY.  BETTY sits
beside him.  JOE paces.  A NURSE adjusts things.  A DOCTOR
examines charts.  A POLICEMAN stands by the door.

DETECTIVE
     How are you feeling?

JOHNNY
     Okay.

DETECTIVE
     You sure?

JOHNNY
     Yeah. I feel fine. Maybe a little sore.
     But I'm ready to go back to school.

DETECTIVE
     Good! Now, Johnny. I have to
     ask you a few questions. Is that okay?

JOHNNY
     Yeah.

DETECTIVE
     Good. Now then. When did you first
     start feeling sick?

JOHNNY
     Yesterday.

DETECTIVE
     What happened?

JOHNNY
     I threw up at my friend's house.

BETTY
     Johnny spent the night there.
     I thought he just had a little virus.

DETECTIVE
     Did you eat anything unusual?

JOHNNY
     No. Just a tuna sandwich.

BETTY
     He loves tuna salad.

DETECTIVE
     I see. And when did you first
     notice the blood?

JOHNNY
     When I went to the bathroom this morning.

DETECTIVE
     Now tell me – and it is very
     important that you be honest…

BETTY
     Don't be afraid, Baby.
     I'm right here with you.
     Daddy's not going to touch you.

DETECTIVE
     Is there anyone in the last
     day or two who…hurt you?

JOHNNY
(a beat.)
     I don't think so.

DETECTIVE
     But someone did…hurt you. No?

JOHNNY
(looks at JOE, then
back to the DETECTIVE)
     No. No one hurt me.

JOE
     Whadya mean no?!
     You've been fucking raped!!

A stunned silence.  JOE hangs his head.

JOE
     Sorry.

Pause.

BETTY
     Would you like me to fix you
     a tuna salad sandwich?

JOHNNY
     Okay.


72.     INT.  MAPLEWOOD HOME - EVENING.                72.

The family is at the dinner table.

TRISH
     More potatoes, Bill?

BILL
     Oh, no thanks. Mmm, I've got plenty.

TRISH
     The babysitter should be here
     any minute now.

BILL
     When does the PTA start?

TRISH
     We've still got half an hour.

BILL
(to BILLY)
     So how was school today?

BILLY
     Okay.

BILL
     Was Johnny there?

BILLY
     No.

TRISH
     I just hope none of you kids
     catch what he's got.

TIMMY tries amusing everyone by pretending to throw up his
potatoes.

TRISH
     Very funny, Timmy. And now you are
     excused and can go right to bed.

TIMMY
     But Mom—!

TRISH
     Excuse me, Bill.

But then the phone rings.  TRISH lets go of TIMMY, answers
it.

TRISH
     Hello?… Yes, is there a problem
     Tawny?… Well, thank you for giving
     me so much notice… Yes, well, I'm
     sorry, too. You should have
     thought of that earlier. Good-bye.

TRISH hangs up, returns to the table.

TRISH
     Bill, you're going to have to
     go yourself tonight.

BILL
     Isn't there anyone else you can get?

TRISH
     Not at this late hour.

TRISH sees the mess TIMMY has been making with his potatoes
and takes him away.

TRISH
(to TIMMY)
     Now you can come with me and take a bath.

TIMMY
     But I'm not finished!

TRISH and TIMMY continue to argue o.s.

BILLY
     Dad? If you and Mom died in a place crash,
     would it be alright f I took over?

BILL
     Well, probably one of your
     aunts would want to help out.

BILLY
     So you don't think I'm old enough
     to take care of myself and
     Timmy and Chloe.

BILL
     Well, no.

BILLY
     Ronald Farber's parents are away in
     Europe for a few days, and he's
     staying home alone without a babysitter.
     Why do I need a babysitter?

BILL
     Well, if you want to change Chloe's
     diapers…

BILLY
     If I didn't have any little brother
     or sister, would you let me stay
     alone by myself for a few days?

BILL
     Your Mom and I are not Mr. and Mrs.
     Farber. We worry. So no.

BILLY
     What if I were 12?

BILL
     No.

BILLY
     13.

BILL
(a beat.)
     At 13, I think you'll be okay.

BILLY
     Can you promise?

BILL
     As long as you don't still
     look like you're 11.

BILLY
     I won't.

BILL
     Okay. At 13, then.


73.     EXT.  MAPLEWOOD HOME - NIGHT.               73.

BILL backs out of the garage and comes to the end of the
driveway.


74.     INT.  BILL'S CAR - NIGHT.                    74.

BILL looks tense as he pauses before the intersection.  He
picks up his car phone and dials information.

BILL
     Hello, in Roseland, please.
     I'm looking for the address of
     a resident. The name is Farber…
     12 Angel Court?… Thank you.

He hangs up.  A sigh.  Suddenly the phone rings.  He answers
it.

BILL
     Hello?


75.     INT.  MAPLEWOOD HOME - NIGHT.               75.

TRISH is on the phone in the kitchen, cleaning up.  CHLOE in
the b.g.

TRISH
     Hi, hon. It's me. Listen, I forgot to
     ask if you could pick up a half-gallon
     of skim milk on your way back
     from the meeting.


BACK TO BILL

On his car phone.

BILL
     Sure thing.

TRISH (O.S.)
     Thanks! Love ya!

BILL
     Love ya!

He hangs up.  Pause.  He steps on thegas.


76.     EXT.  STREET - NIGHT.                         76.

BILL's car moves on, joining the traffic.


77.     EXT.  SCHOOL - NIGHT.                         77.

The parking lot is busy.  BILL's car approaches, pauses.

BILL'S POV of people parking and walking inside the school.
Chatter is audible.  Someone waves hello at him in passing.


78.     INT.  BILL'S CAR - NIGHT.                    78.

BILL is suffering.  But finally he decides to move on.


79.     EXT.  STREET CORNER - NIGHT.                    79.

A Street sign reads, ANGEL COURT.  Bill's car nears and
turns, slowly.


80.     EXT.  FARBER HOME - NIGHT.                    80.

A modern expensive house of the sort that, in this
neighborhood, makes an architectural "statement."  The
number 12 is illuminated over the front door, as is a plaque
reading, The Farbers.

RONALD's silhouette can be faintly seen watching TV.

Bill's car pauses in front, then parks further down the
block.


80.     INT.  BILL'S CAR - NIGHT.                    80.

BILL sits, numb.

He pulls out from his pocket a handkerchief and a dark
little unlabeled bottle filled with some liquid.

He looks at the car clock.

Finally, he opens his door.


81.     EXT.  FARBER HOME - NIGHT.                    81.

BILL sneaks over to the side of the house and looks through
the window.


82.     INT.  FARBER HOME - NIGHT.                    82.

RONALD is lounging on the sofa, still watching TV.  He
snacks on some chips.

BILL slides into the house through a kitchen window.

He tiptoes to a corner round which he can see the back of
RONALD's sofa, across the room.

The phone rings.  BILL freezes.  RONALD answers it.

RONALD
     Hello?… Oh, hey, how's it going?…
     No, Billy Maplewood's selling me his…
     Five bucks, big deal… Yeah, I know,
     but Grasshole can't stay absent
     forever. He'll probably show up
     tomorrow… Yeah, he knows he's got it
     coming, he knows… Oh, okay.  Yeah…Bye.

BILL pours the bottled liquid onto the handkerchief.

He pounces on the victim.  Within moments, RONALD succumbs,
unaware of his assailant's identity.

BILL looks around: the TV is still on; otherwise, silence.

He looks at RONALD, looks away.

FADE TO BLACK.


83.     INT.  7—11 - NIGHT.                         83.

BILL buys a half-gallon of milk.  He sees ALLEN riffling
through some porn at the magazine rack, but slips out of the
store unnoticed.


84.     EXT.  MAPLEWOOD HOME - NIGHT.               84.

Bill's car pulls into the garage.


85.     INT.  MAPLEWOOD HOME - NIGHT.               85.

BILL takes a half-gallon of milk out of a plastic bag and
puts it in the refrigerator.

TRISH (O.S.)
     Hon, is that you?

BILL
     Yeah.

TRISH (O.S.)
     You remember the milk?

BILL
     Yeah.

BILL walks by the TV room where TRISH is sitting watching TV
alone, like Ronald Farber: same position, same channel.

TRISH
     How was the meeting?

BILL
     Okay.

TRISH
     Bill, are you alright?

BILL
     I think I have to lie down.

TRISH
     Oh, shit. I hope you're not
     coming down with whatever that
     Johnny boy had.

BILL
     I don't think so.

BILL stops by BILLY's room.  Back issues of Boy's Life lie
piled on his desk.

BILLY is asleep.  A Playboy magazine sticks out from beneath
his pillow.

BILL goes over to BILLY and bends down.  He kisses him.

BILLY
     Dad?

BILL
     Yeah?

BILLy
     I almost came.

BILLY closes his eyes again.


86.     INT.  BILL AND TRISH'S BEDROOM -               86.
LATER THAT NIGHT.

Lights out.  BILL lies away, listening to TRISH's rhythmic
breathing.

BILL
     Trish?… Trish?

TRISH
     …Mmmyeah?

Pause.

BILL
     Do you love me?

TRISH
     Oh, Bill… Yes.

BILL
     I mean, do you really love me?
     No matter what.

TRISH
     No matter what…what?

BILL
     No matter what…whatever…

TRISH
     Bill. You have me. And you always will.

She holds him closer.  A long pause.

BILL
     I'm sick…

TRISH
     Aww… Take some Tylenol.
     You'll feel better tomorrow.


87.     EXT.  STREET - DAY.                         87.

JOY walks along, despondent.  Suddenly she hears a
Russian-accented voice calling her.  she looks around and
sees a cab pulled up beside her.  BORIS is inside.

BORIS
     Joy! Joy! I am Boris! Your student1

JOY
     Oh, hello, Boris. How are you?

BORIS
     I am fine. How are you?

JOY
     Oh, fine, fine.

Pause.

BORIS
     I not believe you.

JOY
     Really, Boris. I'm fine!

BORIS sees JOY is holding back tears. He gets out of the
cab.

BORIS
     Where you are go now?

JOY
     Oh, I'm just on my way home.

BORIS
     Tell me where do you live.
     I take you home.

JOY
     No, no, I couldn't.

BORIS
     Joy. Come in my car.
     I want give you ride.

JOY
     But I like walking. And the
     train is right nearby.

BORIS
     No. No train. I drive you home.

JOY
     But Boris. I live in New Jersey!

BORIS
     Good. I take you New Jersey.

JOY
     Maybe you don't understand.
     Boris. New Jersey is far.

BORIS
     Joy. You not understand. I am driver.
     My taxi. You come. You understand?
     You come.

Pause.

JOY
     Are you sure you know?

BORIS
     Boris knows. Come inside.

BORIS opens the door for JOY. She gets in. BORIS takes off.


88.     INT.  CAB - DAY.                              88.

They sit in the bumper-to-bumper traffic.  JOY turns to
BORIS, turns away.  MUSIC plays on the radio.  Suddenly she
starts sobbing.

JOY
     I'm sorry.

BORIS
     Don't worry. Soon will be in New Jersey.


89.     EXT.  NEW JERSEY HIGHWAY - EVENING.          89.

The MUSIC on the radio swells as BORIS's taxi speeds along.
They pass a Welcome to New Jersey sign.


90.     INT.  CAB - EVENING.                         90.

JOY changes radio stations.  They listen.  BORIS changes
back.


91.     EXT.  MCDONALD'S - EVENING.                    91.

BORIS and JOY share a little meal along the highway.  The
MUSIC FADES.


92.     INT.  MCDONALD'S - EVENING.                     92.

BORIS and JOY sit in a booth.  They eat in silence.
Finally:

BORIS
     I love New Jersey.

Pause.

JOY
     Don't you miss Russia?

BORIS
     Fuck the cunt of Russia.

Pause.

JOY
     Well, I guess it's best to
     feel that way.


93.     EXT.  JOY'S PLACE - NIGHT.                    93.

BORIS's cab arrives, parks in front.


94.     INT.  CAB - NIGHT.                              94.

JOY turns to BORIS.

JOY
     Well, thank you very much.  That really
     was very nice of you. I'm sorry about
     before…um…it's very unlike me…
(a beat.)
     So do you think you'll need any help
     finding your way back?

BORIS is silent.  He stares off at her place.

BORIS
     Why you not married?

JOY
     Oh, Boris. Life is different in America.
     Here a woman can – I know this is hard
     to understand – but a woman can fulfill
     her potential. There are opportunities
     here to do something, do good…really
     improve the world.

Pause.

BORIS
     Do you like men?

JOY
(a beat.)
     Yes…but…it's not so simple.

BORIS
     Are you lesbian?

JOY
(a beat.)
     No.

BORIS
     It is alright if you are lesbian.
     I like lesbians.

JOY
     I'm sorry, Boris. But I think
     this conversation has become
     a little strange for me.
     Thank you for the ride, and…um…

JOY extends her hand for a handshake, but BORIS kisses her.

JOY
     Oh. Well…um…good night then.
     I guess I'll see you—.

But BORIS grabs her for another, longer kiss instead.
Pause.

JOY
     Would you like to come inside
     for a cup of tea?

BORIS
(a beat.)
     Okay.


95.     INT.  JOY'S PLACE - NIGHT.                    95.

Darkness.  The sound of a key jiggling.  A lock unbolted.
Finally the door opens and they walk inside.  JOY turns on
the lights.  An awkward pause.

JOY
     I'll turn on the kettle.

She goes to the stove.  Turning back she observes BORIS take
off his shoes.

JOY
     Yes, well…um…please take off
     your shoes. Make yourself comfortable.

BORIS wanders around, observing.  JOY feels a little
uncomfortable.

JOY
     It's my parents' place.
     I plan on moving out soon, though.

BORIS
     How long you live here?

JOY
     Since I was born. But really, there are
     a lot of advantages to not moving.
(a beat.)
     So what did you do in Russia?

BORIS
     I was thief.

JOY
     Oh. Do you mean…the mafia?

BORIS
     No. I am independent. I steal things
     on my own. Although I have many offers.
(sees JOY's guitar.)
     You are musician?

JOY
     Oh, no, not really. I just
     write songs a little.

BORIS
     What kind songs?

JOY
     Oh, I don't know. They're all so terrible.

BORIS
(a nod of understanding.)
     Love songs.
(a beat.)
     Play.
(JOY shakes her head,
terrified)
     I play.

BORIS begins playing and singing a song, perhaps an Olivia
Newton-John love ballad. He sings with intense emotion. When
he finishes, the kettle whistles.

JOY brings the teapot to the table and pours for herself and
BORIS.  BORIS comes to his place and drops a half dozen
teaspoons of sugar into his tea.

They sit and drink tea.  Then:

JOY
     Would you like to see my
     macrame collection?
(BORIS looks confused)
     Come. Follow me.

She leads him into her bedroom to her showcase of macrame
dolls, pillows, and assorted knickknacks.

BORIS
(impressed)
     You make?

JOY
     Uh huh.

BORIS
     All by yourself?

JOY
     Uh huh.

Pause.

BORIS
     Beautiful.

JOY
     Thank you. I—I know it might seem
     childish, but sometimes I like to play
     with them and make up stories.
     These two here –
(lifts a pair of figurines)
     I call them Chuckle and Giggle.
     They always make me laugh…

BORIS
     You should build store. Start business.

JOY
     Oh-h-h…

BORIS
(pointing to a doll)
     This? Two hundred dollars. Easy.

JOY
     Oh, but that's Punky!
     I could never sell Punky.
     I could never sell any of this.

BORIS lifts Punky, puts it back, dirty now.

BORIS
(sorry)
     Oh.

JOY
     Don't worry. They're all machine washable.

BORIS
(smiles)
     Ah. Machine washable.

JOY
(a beat)
     You know, your English is really
     very good. You should be in a higher level.

BORIS
(a beat.)
     Your face is like love poem.

BORIS is very close to JOY.  She lets him embrace her.

DISSOLVE TO:


96.     INT.  JOY'S PLACE - LATER THAT NIGHT.          96.

Out of the darkness we hear heavy breathing, sounds of
nervous excitement from JOY.

JOY and BORIS's figures emerge faintly from the darkness.
They are in bed.

BORIS
     Do not be actress. Relax. Boris here.

JOY quiets down. Then suddenly she cries out.  A still
pause.

BORIS
     …Okay.

JOY
(a beat.)
     Okay?

BORIS
(a beat.)
     I go now.

BORIS gets out of bed.  JOY listens to him gather his
things, dress.  Finally, the door opens.  BORIS, her guitar,
and perhaps some stereo equipment disappear.  The door
shuts.


97.     INT.  TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY.               97.

JOY sits alone at a table, perhaps wistful, or melancholy,
and looks out the window.  RHONDA joins her and she perks
up.

RHONDA
     How's it going?

JOY
     Oh, hi, Rhonda!

RHONDA
     Your students treating you okay?

JOY
     Oh, they're just…great! And already
     I'm seeing improvement! But you know,
     the funny thing is…I feel it's me
     who's doing the most learning.

RHONDA
     I know just what you mean.
     'Cause teaching is really about learning.

JOY
     Yeah.
(pause)
     But really I can't tell you how…
     gratifying it's been…I mean, I'm
     giving…and they're taking.
     I couldn't be happier.

RHONDA
     I hate to have to say this, but:
     I told you so.

JOY
     How about you? How's it going
     with your class?

RHONDA
     Oh, my students are just a hoot,
     always telling me how much they
     love me. But if you can keep a secret…
(lowers her voice)
     There's this one Igor I've got
     such a crush on…

JOY
     Oh?

RHONDA
     Not that I'd ever…I mean, these Russians…

JOY
     What?

RHONDA lifts her arm, points to her armpit, mouths "B.O."

JOY
     Really? My students seem okay…

RHONDA
     Well, then, you are lucky.

JOY
     Yeah. I guess I'm lucky.

JOY'S POV THROUGH THE WINDOW of the STRIKERS still marching
on the sidewalk.

BACK TO JOY AND RHONDA gazing outside.  Pause.  RHONDA turns
away from the window.

RHONDA
     You know, Joy, just between you
     and me, I actually think the
     quality of teaching has gone up
     since the strike began.

JOY
     Oh, well, I don't know.
     I just wish it were all over.

RHONDA
     Me too. But you know, once you're
     here and you're teaching, it's as if
     it doesn't even exist. You forget.

Pause.

JOY
     Rhonda?

RHONDA
     Yes?

JOY
     If your Igor…

RHONDA
     …Used deodorant…

JOY
     Do you think…?

A Russian woman, ZHENIA, suddenly interrupts, barging into
the room.  She stands before JOY looking very upset.

ZHENIA
     You teacher Boris?

JOY
     Er… Yes.

ZHENIA spits into JOY's face.

ZHENIA
     Whore!

And she lunges for her, cursing in Russian.  RHONDA, other
TEACHERS, and SECURITY GUARDS get her off JOY and out of the
room.

RHONDA
     My God! That woman was nuts!
     Are you okay?

JOY
(somewhat shaken)
     Oh, fine… Thank you…

A bell rings.  TEACHERS, ET. AL. Begin to disperse.

JOY gathers her stuff, RHONDA helping.

RHONDA
(whispers)
     Joy, you didn't…did you?

Some TEACHERS pause to overhear JOY's anticipated reply.
But it doesn't come.


98.     INT.  ALLEN'S PLACE - EVENING.               98.

ALLEN sits on his bed, tense and sweaty, gripping his phone.


99.     INT.  HELEN'S PLACE - EVENING.               99.

HELEN lies on her bed, strewn with poetry books and papers,
concentrating on the phone.

The phone rings.  She answers it.  She hears only some faint
breathing.  For a while she says nothng.

HELEN (V.O.)
     Thank you for calling me again.
(no response.)
     I'm sorry if I was a little bit…
     aggressive last time, but…I wasn't…
     prepared…and I'm not very good…
     on the phone… But U have to…
     meet you… Can we meet?…

ALLEN hangs up and unplugs the phone.  Pause.

The door buzzes.  ALLEN rises.

ALLEN
     Who is it?

KRISTINA (O.S.)
     Kristina.

ALLEN hesitates, then opens the door. Pause.

KRISTINA
     I'm sorry about last night.

ALLEN
     Yeah. Me too. I shouldn't have…um…

KRISTINA
     I understand. See, I can admit it.
     I'm fat…ugly…

ALLEN
     No, no…

KRISTINA
     Yes, yes…

Tears are trickling down KRISTINA's face.  ALLEN hands her a
crumpled tissue.

KRISTINA
     Thanks.

Pause.

ALLEN
     Say, you wanna go somewhere?

KRISTINA nods, grateful.


100.     EXT.  BAR - NIGHT.                              100.

MUSIC flows outside.


101.     INT.  BAR - NIGHT.                              101.

ALLEN and KRISTINA foxtrot by the jukebox.


102.     INT.  RESTAURANT - NIGHT.                    102.

ALLEN and KRISTINA sit in a booth.  They are eating.

KRISTINA
     I have a confession to make.

ALLEN
     Oh?

KRISTINA
     Remember Pedro's penis?

ALLEN
     You mean, the one that was…cut off?

KRISTINA
     Yeah…well, it wasn't cut off.

ALLEN
     What happened to it?

KRISTINA
(a beat.)
     Nothing.

ALLEN
     I—I don't understand. Why would you
     make something like that up?
(no response.)
     Was Pedro even killed?

KRISTINA nods.

ALLEN
     How do you know?
(no response)
     What happened?

Pause.

KRISTINA
     Well, I'd always been very friendly
     to him. I try to be that way with all
     the doormen, even if they're usually
     snickering behind my back. But I don't
     care, I'm still friendly. It's my way.
     Well, Pedro was different. Pedro never
     snickered. Of course, who was he to
     snicker? He wasn't exactly Tom Cruise.
     Still, he could have, and he didn't.
     Well, anyway, one night…


103.     INT.  APARTMENT BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT.     103.

PEDRO opens the door for KRISTINA.

KRISTINA (V.O.)
     …I had just come back late
     from the 24-hour Pathmark…

PEDRO
     Good evening.

KRISTINA
     Hello, Pedro. Do you think
     you could help me with these bags?

PEDRO
     No problem.

PEDRO locks up and takes the bags from KRISTINA.  They then
walk to the elevator.

KRISTINA (V.O.)
     Normally I don't need any help, but
     my back hurt and the bags were heavy.
     There was half-gallon of strawberry
     ice cream and a couple of boxes of
     fudge, a key lime pie… Really, I just
     couldn't wait to snuggle up under the
     covers and enjoy myself with the TV.
     You know…


104.     INT.  ELEVATOR - NIHGT.                         104.

PEDRO and KRISTINA get inside.

KRISTINA (V.O.)
     It was in the elevator that I first
     got a funny feeling…like he was
     looking at me kind of funny…but I
     thought maybe he was just being
     friendly…

They get off and walk to her apartment.


105.     INT.  KRISTINA'S PLACE - NIGHT.               105.

PEDRO follows KRISTINA inside, brings the groceries to the
kitchen.

KRISTINA
     Well, thank you so much, Pedro.

PEDRO
     No problem.

There is an awkward silence.

KRISTINA (V.O.)
     But then he wouldn't move. I almost
     panicked, but then I realized he
     probably was just waiting for a tip.
     So I got out my purse…and then he
     surprised me.

PEDRO
     Forget about it. What I'd like is
     a scoop of this ice cream before
     going back down.

KRISTINA (V.O.)
     Well, isn't that nice and friendly,
     I thought. Thought I also thought,
     that's a little strange. I'm a
     little shy, you know, and also I had
     only one half-gallon. But he said,
     "Sure!" Well, then he sat down and
     started telling me about how he had
     no family, no friends… I started
     feeling really sorry for him…and I…
     Well, I guess I felt I shouldn't feel
     so superior. But then, all of a sudden,
     just as I was finishing scooping…

BACK TO ALLEN AND KRISTINA in the restaurant.

KRISTINA
     …He started…kissing me…more and more…
     and longer and deeper…it was horrible…
     horrible! Next thing I knew he tore off
     my dress, my…everything! …And he was
     climbing on top of me… He thought
     because I was fat and ugly I'd be…easy…
     that I…wanted it. I tried to fight him
     off, but he was too fast for me, and
     next thing I knew he was…inside me,
     pounding away. Oh, Allen!

KRISTINA grabs a napkin to cry into. Pause.

The WAITRESS comes by.

WAITRESS
     All finished?

ALLEN
     Yeah.

KRISTINA
     I guess so.

WAITRESS
     Would you like to see a dessert menu?

KRISTINA
     What kind of ice cream do you have?

WAITRESS
     Chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry.

KRISTINA
     I'll just have a plain chocolate fudge
     sundae with strawberry ice cream.

WAITRESS
     And you, Sir?

ALLEN
     Just the check, please.

The WAITRESS smiles and leaves.

KRISTINA
     So anyway, everything suddenly got
     quiet and I thought, well, at least
     the worst is over.


106.     INT.  KRISTINA'S PLACE - NIGHT.               106.

PEDRO lies on top of KRISTINA.

PEDRO
     How do you feel now?

KRISTINA
     Kiss me again.

KRISTINA (V.O.)
     Well, of course, that was just an act.
     I let him kiss me one last time, and then…


BACK TO ALLEN AND KRISTINA in the restaurant.

KRISTINA
     …Grabbed hold of his neck and…
     twisted it…backwards.

The WAITRESS comes by with the dessert.

WAITRESS
     Here you are.

KRISTINA
     Thank you.
(while eating her sandae)
     Anyway, so then I had to cut up
     his body, plastic bag all the parts…
     I've been throwing it out gradually
     ever since. There's still a little
     left in my freezer.

Pause.

ALLEN
     So you did cut off his…

KRISTINA
     No, I left it attached. I didn't
     want to have to touch it again.
(a beat.)
     Oh, I feel so terrible. You must
     think I'm a monster. But what else
     could I have done?… Anyway, I couldn't
     help myself. I hate…sex. I'm sorry,
     but just the idea of it…of someone
     all over…inside…me…I know it's not
     right, but… Can we still be…friends?

ALLEN
     Um… I guess… Yeah… I mean, we all
     have our…you know…pluses and minuses…

Pause.

KRISTINA
     It was a crime of passion.
(a beat.)
     I'm a passionate woman.


107.     INT.  APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT.               107.

ALLEN and KRISTINA come out of the elevator.

ALLEN
     Well…

KRISTINA
     I had a lovely time, Allen.
     Thank you. I hope we can do it again.

ALLEN
     Good night.

KRISTINA
     Good night.

ALLEN has entered his apartment and is about to close the
door behind him, when KRISTINA suddenly interrupts:

KRISTINA
     Oh, and Allen!

ALLEN
     Yeah?

KRISTINA
     You're a very good dancer.

ALLEN smiles weakly, then shuts his door, locking and
double-bolting it.  Pause.  KRISTINA returns to her
apartment.


108.     INT.  ALLEN'S PLACE - NIGHT.                    108.

ALLEN stares at his telephone.  Finally, he plugs it in.
Instantly it rings.  He answers it.  At first, just
breathing.  Then:

HELEN (V.O.)
     I've had you on auto-redial all night.

ALLEN hangs up and unplugs the phone again.  He sits down
and stares at it.


109.     INT.  APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - NIGHT.     109.

ALLEN comes out of his apartment and walks bravely down
towards HELEN's apartment.  He stops outside her door.
Pause.  He buzzes.

A moment passes.  ALLEN covers the peephole with his hand.

HELEN (O.S.)
     Hello?

HELEN opens the door, sees ALLEN.

HELEN
     Yes?

Pause.

ALLEN
     I'm the one.

HELEN
     I'm the one.
(a beat.)
     Oh.

She cannot disguise her disappointment, but tries.

HELEN
     Come in.

ALLEN
     Okay.


110.     INT.  HELEN'S PLACE - NIGHT.                    110.

HELEN and ALLEN sit opposite each other.  A long silence.
Finally:

HELEN
     Drink?

ALLEN
     No…thanks.

Pause.

HELEN
     This isn't working.

ALLEN
     No.

HELEN
     You're not my type.

ALLEN
     No.

HELEN
     I'm sorry.

ALLEN
     It's okay.

HELEN
     I made a mistake.

ALLEN
     Me too.

HELEN escorts him out.

HELEN
     Good night.

ALLEN
     Good night.


111.     INT.  APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - NIGHT.     111.

ALLEN walks back towards his door, pauses, looks at the
other end of the hallway: he decides to go visit KRISTINA
instead.

He buzzes KRISTINA's door.

After a few moments, the door opens.  ALLEN looks at the
ground.  KRISTINA's eyes are full, her hands coated with
M&M's.  he walks inside.


112.     INT.  KRISTINA'S PLACE - NIGHT.               112.

ALLEN and KRISTINA lie in bed, facing different directions.


113.     EXT.  FLORIDA/ARIZONA GOLF COURSE - DAY.     113.

It is hot and sunny.  LENNY is golfing alone, isolated.

Suddenly, from afar, he hears a woman's cries.  He looks up.

LENNY'S POV:  An older woman is running around, hysterical.
An older man lies on the ground.  Ambulance men haul him
onto a stretcher and into a waiting ambulance.

After the ambulance has left, a young caddie picks up the
strewn golf equipment and transports it away.


114.     INT.  DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY.                    114.

LENNY sits across from the DOCTOR.

LENNY
     Are you sure?

DOCTOR
     Look, you see this?
(illuminates an x-ray)
     You're the picture of health.

LENNY
     So no tumors.

DOCTOR
     Nope.

LENNY
     …And my heart?

DOCTOR
     Like an ox. Lenny.
     You're gonna live to a hundred.

LENNY
     Oh. That means I still have
     another 35 years.

DOCTOR
(smiles)
     Just stay off the salt!

LENNY
(musters a return smile)
     You bet!


115.     EXT.  CONDO ROADWAY - DAY.                    115.

MONA is driving along.


116.     INT.  MONA'S CAR - DAY.                         116.

MONA notices someone up ahead.

MONA'S POV of DIANE jogging.

BACK TO MONA contemplating murder.  She aims for DIANE.  But
as she gets closer, a SECURITY GUARD suddenly appears.  She
waves with a friendly smile at DIANE instead.

ANGLE ON DIANE waving back in a pleasant manner.


117.     INT.  MONA AND LENNY'S CONDO - NIGHT.          117.

LENNY and MONA are preparing for bed, watching TV.

MONA
     I met with Steven Zimmer this morning.

LENNY
     You like him?

MONA
     Yeah. I'm gonna hire him.

LENNY
     Good. I'm gonna use Marty Blau.

MONA
     Good. I feel so much better now.

LENNY
     Yeah. It shouldn't take too long.

Pause.

MONA
     Lenny?

LENNY
     Yeah?

MONA
     Can you sleep on the living room sofa?

LENNY
     Why?

MONA
     Steven Zimmer thought it would be
     a good idea.

Pause.

LENNY
     Okay.

LENNY starts off for the living room, gets extra pillow and
blanket.  Pause.  MONA then gets up and follows him into the
living room.

MONA
     Lenny?

LENNY
     Yeah?

MONA
     You don't have to sleep there.
     You can stay with me if you want.

LENNY
     Nah. It's okay. Good night.

MONA
     Good night.

Pause.  MONA turns back towards her bedroom.

LENNY
     Close the door behind you.

MONA closes the door behind her.


118.     INT.  DIANE'S CONDO - DAY.                    118.

LENNY rings the doorbell.  DIANE opens the door.

DIANE
     Oh, hello.

LENNY
     I thought I'd say hi.

DIANE
     Please come in.

LENNY follows DIANE into her living room.  She fixes a
couple drinks, turns on a cd.

DIANE
     Gin and tonic?

LENNY
     Okay. Thanks.

She returns with the drinks, sits beside him on the sofa.

DIANE
     Uch, it's so bright outside.
     It gives me a headache just
     looking out the window.

LENNY
     It's supposed to rain tomorrow.

DIANE
     I don't want to talk about the weather.

Pause.

LENNY
     Well, it was good for playing golf.

DIANE
     I hate that game. It's so slow and tedious.

LENNY
     Still, it passes time.

DIANE
     I like to travel.

LENNY
     I wen to Europe once.

DIANE
     Have you ever been to Tahiti?

LENNY
     No.

DIANE
     What about Tunisia? A night in Tunisia!

LENNY
     No.

DIANE
     Vincent never liked to travel.

LENNY
     I guess I'm like Vincent.

DIANE
(laughs)
     You know, when I was a child I always
     imagined I'd marry the man I fell in
     love with, have a son and daughter who
     loved me as much as I hated my mother,
     then die tragically and suddenly,
     young and beautiful. Later, when
     Vincent left me, I imagined I'd finally
     be happy.

LENNY
     I guess you've never lost your imagination.

DIANE
     Lenny, I've got to get out of here…
     I can't breath… The women are all…
     pathetic gossips…and the men…

LENNY
     …Just pathetic?

DIANE
     I don't want to die here.

LENNY
     You just don't want to die.

DIANE
     Not alone.

They make love.  Afterwards, LENNY turns away.

DIANE
     Don't. Don't feel guilty.

LENNY turns back, looks at her.

LENNY
     I don't. I don't feel anything.


119.     INT.  MAPLEWOOD HOME - EVENING.               119.

The family is at the table, eating dinner.

BILL
     So how was school today?

BILLY
     Okay. Ronald Farber was absent.

BILL
     Oh?

BILLY
     He was afraid of the math test.

TRISH
     So he stayed home?

BILLY
     Yeah. He cut.

TRISH
     Oh, that's terrible. His parents…

BILLY
     They don't know yet.
     They're still on vacation.

TRISH
     Oh, are they gonna be upset.

BILLY
     Yeah, well, Ronald's gonna be upset
     when he finds out the test was cancelled.

BILL
     What happened?

BILLY
     Mrs. Paley was absent also.

TRISH
(chuckles.)
     Oh, gee!

BILL
     Did you call Ronald and tell him?

BILLY
     Yeah, but there was no answer.

TRISH
     So was Mrs. Paley sick, then?

BILLY
     Well, everyone says she was
     just too strung out.

TRISH
     Now why do people say things like that?

BILLY
     'Cause she's a drug addict.

TRISH
     And how do you know?

BILLY
     Mom. Everyone knows.

TRISH
     Well, I didn't know. Did you know, Bill?

BILL
     No.

BILLY
     Well, it's what everyone says: she's
     a junkie. And she's probably gonna be
     fired. It's really sad.

TRISH
     Well, if Mrs. Paley turns out, in fact,
     to be a junkie, then…she should be
     fired. Don't you think, Bill?

BILL
     I don't know. Don't you think that's
     a little harsh? I mean, if it's not
     affecting her work…

TRISH
     Well, apparently it is. And no, in fact,
     I don't think it's a little harsh at all.
     I'm sorry, but when it comes to drug
     abuse…and children, my children… Uch,
     they should all be locked up and
     throw away the key. I'm serious.
     And Billy, I want you to know, if you
     ever even think of doing drugs, and
     end up dying in a hospital…I'd disown you.
     That's how strongly I feel. Now I know,
     Bill, I may sound harsh, but we're
     talking about our kids. Not to be too
     grandiose, but this is the future,
     the future of our country we're
     talking about, after all.

A pause.  The telephone rings.

TRISH
     I'll get it.
(answers the phone.)
     Hello, who is this, pleas?…
     Oh, hi… Sure, hold on…
(to BILL)
     It's Joe Grasso.

BILL
     Oh, great! Thanks!
(rises, picks up the phone)
     Hey, Joe! Whay's up? How's Johnny doing?


120.     INT.  JOE'S PLACE - EVENING.                    120.

JOE grips the telephone tightly.

JOE
     You're a dead man.

He hangs up.

BACK TO THE MAPLEWOOD HOME where we see BILL's reaction to
the telephone CLICK.

BILL
(fakes continuing
the conversation)
     Oh, good, good… No problem!… Right…
     Okay. Well, take care… Bye!

TRISH
     How's Johnny doing?

BILL
     Oh, fine, fine! Much better!

The doorbell rings.

TRISH
     Now who could that be?

BILL
     I'll get it.

BILL goes to the front door.

BILL
     Who is it?

VOICE
     Police officer.

BILL opens the door.  There is a DETECTIVE and TWO POLICE
OFFICERS.

BILL
     Can I help you?

DETECTIVE
     Are you William Maplewood?

BILL
     Y-yes.

DETECTIVE
     Sorry to disturb you, but we have some
     questions for you and your wife. It has
     to do with your son's friend, Johnny Grasso.

BILL
     Did something…?
(a meaningful silence)
     Come this way. We're just finishing
     dinner, but I—I'll be right with you.

BILL escorts them into the living room.

TRISH (O.S.)
     Bill, who is it?

BILL goes to the dining room, mouths, "The Police!" to
TRISH, so the children won't know.

BILL
     You take care of the kids.

BILL returns to his guests.  They all sit down.  BILL is
noticeably jittery.

BILL
     Sorry. Now…um…you said something
     about Ronald Farber?

The DETECTIVE is nonplussed.

BILL
     I'm sorry…er…I mean…I mean, Johnny Grasso?


121.     INT.  BILL AND TRISH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT.     121.

TRISH is asleep, but BILL is wide awake.  He is terrified as
he lies in bed, listening to the night sounds.

He thinks he hears footsteps.

He looks up and sees JOHNNY

JOHNNY
     You're so cool.

JOHNNY moves to embrace BILL, but then BILL suddenly jumps
up in fright, awake again.

TRISH
(waking up)
     Bill?  Are you alright?

BILL holds onto TRISH, embracing her, shivering.

BILL
     …Don't leave me…Please don't leave me…

TRISH comforts him.


122.     EXT.  MAPLEWOOD HOME - DAY.                    122.

Holding TIMMY's hand, TRISH comes out the front door in her
robe and slippers.

A schoolbus is waiting at the corner.

TRISH
(calling to the bus)
     One second!
(calling inside)
     Hurry up, Billy! The bus is here!

BILLY rushes out after them, but is too late: the bus has
already taken off.  Defeated, TRISH, BILLY, and TIMMY turn
back to the house, then suddenly stop and look: the words
"Rapist" and "Pervert" have been spray-painted onto their
housefront.


123.     EXT.  PARK - DAY.                              123.

It is sunny and warm, the same park seen in Bill's dream
earlier in the movie.  Couples straight and gay walk hand in
hand, families picnic, beautiful people sunbathe.

BILL observes the pleasant tranquility from atop a hill.
But this time he gently approaches everyone and startrs
hugging them.  Many smiles and tears.

MUSIC SWELL.

PSYCHIATRIST (O.S.)
     Beautiful.


124.     INT.  PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY.          124.

BILL sits opposite his PSYCHIATRIST.

PSYCHIATRIST
     That's a beautiful dream.

BILL
     Thank you. I take it as a sign.

PSYCHIATRIST
     Of…

BILL
     Trish and I are thinking of moving.
     Out into the country. The real country.

PSYCHIATRIST
     How are things between you and Trish?

BILL
(a beat.)
     Never better.

PSYCHIATRIST
     Oh?

BILL
     I don't know what happened, but
     all of a sudden, one night last week
     we were watching TV and…she
     turned me on. The kids went to bed
     and…we fucked. And on the weekend…
     in the morning, too…we fucked.
     My life is just one big fuck!

BILL laughs, the PSYCHIATRIST chuckles.

PSYCHIATRIST
     I'm happy to hear that.

BILL
     Thanks. But you know it's strange…
     I mean how like…now…just like that…
     everything's normalized.

A long pause.  Then BILL rises.

BILL
     Well.

PSYCHIATRIST
     There's still ten minutes.
     Nothing more you want to discuss?

BILL
     No, I guess not. Everything's fine.

BILL walks towards the door, but stops before a photograph
of a young boy hanging on the wall.

BILL
     Was that you?

PSYCHIATRIST
     Yeah.

BILL
     Hmmmph. You've changed.


125.     INT.  MAPLEWOOD HOME - EVENING.               125.

The family eats at the dinner table.  No one talks.  The
mood is tense.


126.     INT.  LIVING-ROOM - EVENING.                    126.

While TRISH puts TIMMY and CHLOE to bed, BILL and BILLY sit
on the couch in front of the TV.

BILLY
     Dad?

BILL
     Yes, Billy?

BILLY
     Everyone at school is saying
     things about you.

BILL
     Who is everyone?

BILLY
     Kids. You know. Everyone.

BILL
     What are they saying?

Pause.

BILLY
     That you're a serial rapist.

BILL
     Oh.

BILLY
     And a pervert.

BILL
     You mean, like what they
     painted on the house?

BILLY nods.  Pause.

BILLY
     Dad…did you…did you…with Johnny Grasso
     and Ronald Farber…?

Pause.

BILL
     Yes.

Pause.

BILLY
     What did you…do?

BILL
     I…I touched them…

BILLY
     Whadya mean exactly…touched…?

BILL
     I…fondled them.

Pause.

BILLY
     What for?

BILL
     I couldn't help myself.

Pause.

BILLY
     What else?

BILL
     I unzipped myself…

BILLY
     Do you mean…masturbated?

BILL
     No.

BILLY
     Then…what?

BILL
     I…made love…

Pause.

BILLY
     What does that…mean?

BILL
     I fucked them.

Pause.

BILLY
     What was it like?

BILL
     It was…great.

Pause.

BILLY
     Would you do it again?

BILL
     Yes.

Pause.

BILLY
     Would you ever fuck me?

BILL
     No…I jerk off instead.

BILL weeps.


127.     INT.  BILL AND TRISH'S BATHROOM - NIGHT.     127.

BILL swallows half a dozen sleeping pills.


128.     EXT.  MAPLEWOOD HOME - NIGHT.               128.

A car drives up and idles out front.  DRUNKEN TEENAGERS
laugh and curse as they throw beer bottles at the house.
They quickly speed off.


129.     INT.  BILL AND TRISH'S BEDROOM -                129.
THAT MOMENT.

BILL and TRISH hear the sound of a window being shattered,
but remain in bed.

BILL
     It's true: I'm a pervert.


130.     EXT.  MAPLEWOOD HOME - DAYBREAK.               130.

TRISH carries CHLOE and a suitcase as she rushes BILLY and
TIMMY out to the car.  KOOKI follows along.  The door slams
behind them.

TIMMY
     Mommy, I'm—!

TRISH
     Shh! Quiet!

They get in the hastily packed car and drive off.


131.     INT.  MAPLEWOOD HOME - DAY.                    131.

BILL wakes up.  He gets out of bed and looks around.  He
sees drawers have been emptied and left open.

BILL
     Trish?

He goes to CHLOE's room and sees just an empty crib.  He
checks BILLY and TIMMY's room: no one is there.

BILL
     Billy?  Timmy?

He searches the rest of the house, though somewhat
perfunctorily, as he knows he will find no one.

BILL
     Hello?

He looks bereft as he stands uncertainly in the middle of
the house.

The doorbell rings.  He hesitates, then goes to open the
front door.


132.     EXT.  MAPLEWOOD HOME - DAY.                    132.

BILL opens the door and finds a brown paper-wrapped package
on the welcome mat.  It says, "For Bill."  He picks it up,
takes it inside, shuts the door.

Pause.  Then: BOOM!

FADE TO BLACK.


133.     INT.  SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY.                    133.

JOY sits on the train.  She is carrying a bouquet of
flowers.


134.     EXT.  BRIGHTON BEACH SUBWAY STATION - DAY.     134.

JOY gets off the train, walks down to the street.


135.     EXT.  BRIGHTON BEACH AVENUE - DAY.          135.

JOY walks amongst many Russian immigrants.  She pauses to
dig a piece of paper out of her pants pocket.  There is an
address scribbled on it.


136.     EXT.  SIDE STREET - DAY.                    136.

JOY comes up to the entrance of a seedy building.  She
hesitates, then walks inside.


137.     INT.  SEEDY BUILDING - DAY.                    137.

JOY climbs a few flights of stairs, arrives at a door with
the number 8D on it.  She buzzes, then waits.  She hears
quarreling, in Russian.

ZHENIA opens the door.  She has a black eye and a cut lip.

JOY
     Oh…er…I'm sorry…I just wanted to…
     er…Here…

JOY shoves her bouquet of flowers into ZHENIA's hand.  She
is about to beat a hasty retreat when ZHENIA suddenly calls:

ZHENIA
     Boris!

ZHENIA abandons JOY at the door and goes back inside,
muttering obscenities (in Russian).

BORIS appears at the door, surprised to see her.  Oddly, JOY
seems equally surprised to see him.

BORIS
     Come inside.


138.     INT.  BORIS AND ZHENIA'S PLACE - DAY.          138.

JOY sits opposite BORIS.  ZHENIA brings her a cup of tea.
ZHENIA'S MOTHER sniffles and shuffles about in the b.g.

JOY
(to ZHENIA)
     Spaceebo.

BORIS signals ZHENIA to scram.

BORIS
     Joy. Why are you come here?

JOY
     I just wanted to…um…say
     I was sorry…to your wife.

BORIS
     Zhenia is not my wife.

JOY looks confused, perhaps even suspicious.  BORIS shouts
something in Russian to ZHENIA.

ZHENIA
(to JOY)
     I am not wife Boris.

BORIS corrects Zhenia's grammar.

ZHENIA
     I am not…Boris's wife.

BORIS
(to ZHENIA)
     Thank you.

And he dismisses her once more.

BORIS
     Her English very bad. I try teach,
     but Zhenia…slow.

JOY
     So you mean you're really not married?

BORIS
(laughs)
     I am in America! I am free man!

ZHENIA
     Is Zhenia a free woman?

BORIS rolls his eyes.  Pause.

BORIS
     Zhenia loves me. It is problem.
     She want be my wife, but she don't
     listen. What can I do? What can I do?
(a beat.)
     Come. You want me to drive you
     New Jersey? We go shopping mall?

JOY
     No, thank you. I don't think that's really…

JOY suddenly notices her guitar lying against the wall
opposite.  When she turns back to BORIS he is shouting
something in Russian at ZHENIA again.  ZHENIA shouts
something back, and a new quarrel begins.  A baby cries
somewhere o.s.

When things cool down ZHENIA brings over a tray with
pastries and vodka.

BORIS
     Joy. I must ask you question.

JOY
     Yes?

BORIS
     But I very ashamed.

JOY
     I'm sure I'll understand.

BORIS
     Okay. Can I borrow money?

JOY
     Oh. Well…

BORIS
     It is very important.

Pause.

JOY
     Well, I guess it's better borrowing
     than stealing…

BORIS
     Yes. It is better.

JOY
     And money is…only money.

BORIS
     Yes. It is only money.

JOY glances over at ZHENIA standing at the other end of the
room.  Her face is anxious, pleading.

JOY
     How much would you like?

BORIS
     One thousand dollars.

JOY
     A th-thou—.

BORIS
     Alright. Five hundred. I need money now.

JOY
     W-well I guess I could go to
     a cash machine…

BORIS
     I know where is ATM.

BORIS rises quickly.  JOY hesitates.

JOY
     Boris?

BORIS
     Yes?

JOY
     Do you think I could have my guitar back?


139.     EXT.  STREET - EVENING.                         139.

BORIS and JOY, guitar in hand, are walking.

BORIS
     Do you think shopping mall in
     New Jersey is open tonight?

JOY
     Yeah. Probably.

They stop outside a bank.  JOY withdraws her money from the
ATM.  BORIS anxiously awaits on the sidewalk until JOY hands
it over.

JOY
     Here.

BORIS
     Joy. I love you.

JOY
     You love New Jersey.

BORIS
     New Jersey is America!
(laughs, embraces JOY.)
     I give you back Monday.

JOY
     That's okay. I won't be there, anyway.

BORIS
     Why no?

JOY
     I don't know, but for some reason…
     now I have more sympathy for the strikers.
(a beat.)
     See ya.

BORIS watches JOY walk away with her guitar.

BORIS
(mutters to himself)
     Stupid American.

BORIS pockets his money and walks off in the opposite
direction.


TITLE CARD: "THANKSGIVING"

140.     EXT.  MONA'S CONDO - DAY.                    140.

BILLY stands on the terrace and looks down.  He sees palm
trees.  He sees the ocean.  He sees a beautiful woman
sunbathing by the pool.  Talk of turkey and weather filters
out to him.

KOOKI stands beside him.


141.     INT.  BOCA RATON CONDOMINIUM - DAY.          141.

LENNY, MONNA, HELEN, TRISH, and JOY sit at a long table
filled with holiday food.  TIMMY watches TV in the b.g.
CHLOE sleeps in her crib.

HELEN
     …Anyway, so the police came and looked
     in her freezer and found baggies filled
     with the super's genitals.

Pause.  LENNY salts his food, a heavy dose.

MONA
     I use baggies.

JOY
     Me too.

HELEN
     Everyone uses baggies. That's why we can
     all relate to the crime. Don't you see?

TRISH
     I can't relate to it.

Pause.

HELEN
     …In any case, there's a guy I've met,
     Joy, that I think you'd like.
     He's into computers, I think,

JOY
     How do you know him?

HELEN
     He's another neighbor of mine.
     Do you wanna call him, or should I
     give him your number?

JOY
     I'll call him.

HELEN
     Oh, great. I know he'd really like that.

TRISH
     What about me?

HELEN
     I'm looking, I'm looking.

TRISH
     I like computers.

HELEN
     Trish, trust me on this one:
     not for you.

MONA
     And what about me?

HELEN
     Mom, I haven't forgotten. It's just
     it's hard. But I am looking for everyone.

LENNY
     Don't look for me.

HELEN
     Have you found someone?

LENNY
     No. There is no one.

Pause.

MONA
     I heard Diane Fred had a stroke.

LENNY
     She'll recover.

MONA
     That's good.

JOY
     Where there's life there's hope.

TRISH
     That's right.

HELEN
     You bet.

MONA
     Absolutely.

LENNY
     Yeah.

Pause.

JOY
     Could you pass over the
     sweet potatoes, please?

TRISH
     Sure.

Pause.  LENNY resalts his food.

HELEN
     Could you pass down the stuffing, please?

LENNY
     Here.

Pause.

TRISH
     Anyone watch Leno last night?

Everyone shakes his head or mumbles no.

Pause.

MONA
     So what's going to happen now to
     that woman who killed your super?

HELEN
     I don't know, Mom. But it's so sad.
     She's all alone.
(a beat.)
     I wish I'd gotten to know her better.
     We might have found we had something
     in common.

Pause.

JOY
     Maybe you'll write a poem about her.

HELEN bursts out laughing.

HELEN
     I'm sorry. But don't worry.
     I'm not laughing at you.
     I'm laughing with you.

JOY
     But I'm not laughing.

HELEN stops laughing.


142.     EXT.  CONDOMINIUM TERRACE - DAY.               142.

CLOSE ON BILLY as his face expresses mounting excitement.

BILLY'S POV of the beautiful woman sunbathing.  She unhooks
her bikini top.

BACK TO BILLY climaxing.  CLOSE ON COOKI licking up BILLY's
little puddle of sperm on the floor.


143.     INT.  CONDOMINIUM - DAY.                    143.

The meal is painfully silent.  Finally:

MONA
     Let's make a toast.

JOY
     To happiness.

EVERYONE ELSE
     To happiness!

Glasses clink.  Some hesitation before everyone downs the
wine.  Laughter.  KOOKI races in, jumps into TRISH's lap,
licks her face.

TRISH
     Kooki!

BILLY enters.  He is ecstatic.  Tears well up in his eyes.

BILLY
     I came!

SHOT OF A FULL MOON.


144.     INT.  CONDOMINIUM - NIGHT.                    144.

The CAMERA DOLLIES across the living room and bedrooms.
Everyone is in bed, but unable to shut their eyes.

MONA rises to the terrace, her eyes silently welling with
tears.  JOY follows her.

JOY
     Don't, Mom. 'Cause the thing about
     family is…no matter how distant you are
     from each other, separated, estranged,
     divorced, whatever…no matter how little
     you can relate to each other…it doesn't
     matter: you're still family. You're not
     along… Ya see?

MONA smiles, weakly.

CUT TO:

BLACK.

The sound of a telephone ringing.  Then:


145.     SPLIT SCREEN: EXT. ESL SCHOOL/               145.
INT.  ALLEN'S PLACE - DAY.

JOY stands at a payphone, a placard resting on her shoulder.
Strikers pace in the b.g.

ALLEN sits half undressed on his bed, phonebook at his side.
He answers the phone.

BOUNCY MUSIC.

ALLEN
     Hello?

JOY
     Hello. Could I please speak to
     Allen Mellencamp?

ALLEN
     Speaking.

JOY
     Well, my sister Helen told me
     I should call you.

ALLEN
     Oh, then you must be Joy. Hi.

JOY
     Hi. Gee, you sound so familiar.

ALLEN
     You do too.

JOY
     But in a good way, a way I like.

ALLEN
     Me too.

JOY
     Huh.

ALLEN
     Say, what are you wearing, I mean
     doing tonight?

JOY
     Oh, nothing special. Would you
     like to get together?

ALLEN
     Yeah. I know a great place off Exit 146.
     Have you heard of Happy's?

JOY
     Er…yeah.

ALLEN
     Is Happy's no good?

JOY
     No. It's great. Let's meet there at eight.

ALLEN
     Happy's at eight! See ya!

They hang up, happy, perhaps even smitten.

CUT TO:

BLACK.
