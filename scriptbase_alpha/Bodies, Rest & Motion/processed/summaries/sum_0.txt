Nick is a feckless television salesman who gets fired and impulsively decides that he and his girlfriend, Beth, will move to Butte, MT, which he's read is "the city of the future."
"I read that a while ago, so the future should be there by now," he enthuses.
He waits until the last moment to tell Carol, his ex and Beth's best friend, about the move.
While Nick is working his last day, Sid comes to the couple's house to paint it for the next tenants.
He quickly develops an interest in Beth.
He, Beth, and Carol get stoned and hang out.
When Sid hears about the move, he tells Beth that he's never left Enfield, and has no interest in traveling.
Meanwhile, Nick decides to take off on his own.
When Beth gets word of this from Carol, she finds solace in Sid's arms.
Sid proclaims his love the next morning, and implores Beth to stay.
Meanwhile, Nick visits his childhood home, looking for his parents, has an epiphany, and decides to return to Carol.
