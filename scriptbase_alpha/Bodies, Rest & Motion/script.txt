THE SCREEN IS BLACK

FADE IN:

INT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY

THE CAMERA LOOKS DOWN ON three levels of escalators 
transporting a smattering of Southwestern shoppers -- some 
in cowboy hats.

AS CREDITS ROLL

A SERIES OF ANGLES of shoppers being conveyed up and down.

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - SUNSET

A beautiful vista -- cacti and sage dot the landscape as it 
rises to mountains in the distance.

END CREDITS

THE CAMERA PANS revealing an island of modern culture -- 
malls and more malls, parking lots, and fast food franchises.

FADE IN TITLE: ENFIELD, ARIZONA

A brown Pinto pulls out of a parking lot and into rush hour 
traffic.

INT. PINTO - DUSK

BETH WALKER is driving. She looks younger, but she's twenty-
eight. She has a strong face and flashing intelligent eyes. 
She's wearing a WAITRESS UNIFORM from Friendly's. She's deep 
in thought.

Beth pulls up to stoplight and stops.

SOUND: A gentle toot of car horn.

Beth looks up, startled.

BETH'S POV

SID, a pleasant looking twenty-four year old, is in a pick-
up truck next to her. He smiles and points up toward the 
traffic light.

BETH

She looks up toward the traffic light.

TRAFFIC LIGHTS

They're red except for one with a lit green arrow.

BETH AND SID

She pantomimes that she's in the wrong lane and wants to go 
straight.

Sid pantomimes that he'll let her cut in front of him.

SOUND: Horns honk impatiently.

THE INTERSECTION

Beth pulls away in front of the pick-up truck. The HONKING 
continues. Sid looks back at the honking car, cheerfully 
waves to it.

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. CAROL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A tiny well-kept Spanish style home in lower middle class 
residential section.

INT. CAROL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

It's neat and smartly furnished -- discount Swedish modern, 
framed deco posters, some nice plants. The only problem is 
it seems a little more like a well-designed waiting room 
than a home.

There's an empty ice bucket, several empty liquor bottles, 
and a swinging metal ball thingabobby on a chrome and glass 
coffee table in front of leather sofa.

CAROL AND NICK are curled up together on the sofa, drinks in 
hand.

They're both in their late twenties. Carol's dressed in the 
casually stylish clothes worn by women who work in shopping 
mall boutiques.

Nick's clothes are frumpled, a knit tie loose around his 
neck. They've achieved a state of contemplative drunkenness.

Carol sips her drink. Nick sips his drink. Carol sips her 
drink. Nick brings his glass to his lips, hesitates...

               NICK
          (flatly)
     We're moving.

               CAROL
     What?

               NICK
          (enunciating)
     We're going to move.

               CAROL
          (after a beat)
     When?

               NICK
     Two days.

               CAROL
     In two days?!

               NICK
     Yeah.

Carol shakes her head in weary disbelief.

               CAROL
          (covering her hurt)
     Thanks for the news...

She knocks back her drink. Nick broods.

               NICK
     I haven't known for long. I just 
     decided.
          (ruminating)
     What do I need that makes me make 
     these decisions?

Carol stares at him. He knocks back his drink.

               CAROL
     You got me.

She pours herself another drink.

               CAROL
     What does Beth say?

               NICK
     Beth?...

                                   CUT TO:

INT. BETH'S CAR - NIGHT

She stops at an intersection.

               NICK (V.O.)
     Whatever makes me happy. That's what 
     she says...

Headlights flash from behind her. She turns and looks.

BETH'S POV

Sid's smiling from his truck right behind her. He flashes 
his lights again.

INT. BETH'S PINTO

Beth looks up in the rearview mirror, amused.

REARVIEW MIRROR

Sid turns off, disappearing into the night.

BETH

Surprised to find herself vaguely disappointed, she drives 
on.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. CAROL'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

It's small, prefab, and tidy. It has a counter with shutters 
that open onto the living room. Nick is kneeling, going 
through bottles in a cabinet.

               NICK
          (w/ drunken desperation)
     I know this place.

Nick stands, with an almost empty bottle of Johnny Walker 
Red.

               NICK
     I know what happens here.

He pours himself a drink. Carol shuts the cabinet.

               NICK
     I know what's going to happen.

Nick opens a cabinet under the sink and tosses the empty 
bottle in the trash. He begins to pace. Carol shuts the 
cabinet and follows him with her gaze.

As Nick speaks, he gestures grandly with his drink, liquor 
splashing unnoticed over the sides.

               NICK
          (bursting with 
               frustration)
     The same job, same scenery, same 
     people... I've been in this town for 
     years... Years!!

               CAROL
          (flatly)
     Three years.

               NICK
          (in despair)
     Oh, Carol...

               CAROL
     I know...

He stops and slugs back his drink.

               NICK
     Forever -- it seems forever.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. BETH'S PINTO - CONTINUOUS

Beth pulls up to a stoplight, her face blank with thought. 
She's suddenly lit by the flash of headlights going on and 
off. She looks up and smiles.

EXT. INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS

Sid's pick-up truck is facing her across the intersection. 
It slowly pulls up beside her and stops.

He smiles and gives a little wave of his hand.

Without knowing why, she smiles and waves back.

               BETH
          (sweetly but firmly)
     Good-bye.

She drives away. Sid stares after her.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. CAROL'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Carol lifts the end metal ball on the thingabobby and releases 
it, starting the chain reaction. She stares at it clacking 
back and forth as she speaks.

               CAROL
     How long a drive is it?

Nick paces.

               NICK
     Fourteen hours.

               CAROL
     That's not bad.

               NICK
     In a car? It's a fuckin' nightmare.

Carol stops the metal ball. She releases two balls, starting 
a new chain reaction.

               NICK
          (griping)
     And there's no radio in Utah. It's 
     all religious programs.

               CAROL
     Get saved.

Nick slumps on the sofa beside her.

               NICK
          (flatly)
     No thanks.

               CAROL
     Hey. Think about this. You take a 
     detour and go through Vegas -- you 
     and Beth stop, see a show, have a 
     nice romantic dinner -- play the 
     slots, get the free drinks...

               NICK
          (interrupting)
     Too much money. The show. The meal. 
     The slots. Then the hotel -- that's 
     another hundred down the toilet.

As Carol speaks she pokes at Nick. He fends off her blows. 
By the end of her speech she is on top of him mock-strangling 
him.

               CAROL
          (jabbing Nick)
     No, you skip the hotel. It's night, 
     the highway's empty -- you can make 
     good time. You start speeding. You 
     get stopped in Utah by the cops -- 
     you flunk the breathalizer, they 
     haul you in. The judge is Mormon -- 
     you get fifteen years, you go to 
     prison, but at least your life has 
     taken a direction!

Nick and Carol collapse into laughter. The front door opens.

               BETH
          (calling in)
     I'm here!

Beth steps in. Carol quickly lets go of Nick's neck and gets 
off him.

NICK AND CAROL

Embarrassed, they both smile self-consciously.

There's an awkward instant followed by too much cheerfulness.

               CAROL
          (chipper)
     Hi!

               NICK
     Hi, honey.

               CAROL
     Hi.

BETH

stands in the doorway, awkwardly conscious of having 
interrupted something.

               BETH
          (w/ forced cheer)
     Hi.

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. FRONT LAWN - NIGHT

Nick and Beth are standing in the lawn, lit by the glow of 
the porch lamp.

Both sides of the street are lined with nearly identical 
tiny faux Spanish houses.

               BETH
     G'night.

THE FRONT DOORWAY

Carol waves.

               CAROL
     G'night.

ANOTHER ANGLE INCLUDING NICK, BETH, AND CAROL

               NICK
          (calling out)
     Pizza Hut, tomorrow?

               CAROL
     Okay.
          (to Beth)
     I've got the short shift -- you want 
     me to come over, help pack?

               BETH
     Great... I'm really sorry we didn't 
     tell you sooner. He just decided.

CAROL

smiles to herself, a trace of sadness in her eyes.

               CAROL
     I understand.

She shuts the door.

NICK AND BETH

She starts to walk across the lawn. She stops and stares at 
Nick, who's staring out into the night, oblivious to her.

               BETH
     I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

He turns and looks at her.

               NICK
     What's your problem?

               BETH
     I haven't got a problem.

               NICK
     Okay.

He walks up to her and past her -- when she doesn't fall 
into step, he stops.

               NICK
     You agreed to try Billings.

               BETH
     I know.
          (in Nick's words)
     Billings, Montana. City of the future.

               NICK
     Yeah and I read that a while ago -- 
     so the future's probably already 
     there.

She smiles and shakes her head.

               NICK
          (defensively)
     It's not like you're leaving anything 
     behind. A good job or something.

               BETH
     Just some friends.

He puts his arms around her waist from behind, and nestles 
her against his body.

               NICK
     You'll make new friends.

               BETH
     I know.
          (after a beat)
     I'm not eight years old. I know I'll 
     make new friends.

               NICK
     Then what is it?

She pulls away from him and starts walking to the house next 
door. He falls into step with her.

               BETH
          (uncomfortably)
     I, umm... I... It embarrasses me. 
     When you talk about something with 
     Carol that happened before me. She's 
     my best friend. It embarrasses me 
     that you used to live with her.

               NICK
     That was years ago.

               BETH
     Three years.

               NICK
     That's right.

               BETH
     I know...

               NICK
     And we're moving. She won't be your 
     best friend anymore.

They arrive at their front door. Beth takes out her keys. 
Nick stops her hand and kisses her. She kisses him back.

               NICK
     Living with someone isn't such a big 
     deal.

She nods and looks to the lock.

               NICK
     Anyway... I live with you now.

Beth looks to Nick. He stares out at the night.

                                   CUT TO:

CLOSE-UP: COFFEE-MAKER

The coffee-maker clock hits nine o'clock. The coffee maker 
clicks on with a rattle. Steam starts to spew out.

The coffee-maker makes horrible gurgling sounds.

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

The kitchen is small and a little grimy, its furnishings 
fatigued.

Nick stares at the coffee-maker in disbelief. He's dressed 
in a dress shirt, untied necktie, and slacks. He's carrying 
a sportscoat with a Sears' employee name-tag attached.

               NICK
          (calling out)
     Beth!... Beth!!

Beth walks into the kitchen, wearing a robe and carrying the 
paper.

Nick points accusingly at the coffee maker as water pours 
down from around its top.

               NICK
     It's... it's raining!

               BETH
     It does that.

She drops the paper on the kitchen table and gets a mug off 
the counter.

               NICK
     Since we got it?

               BETH
     No.
          (pouring herself a 
               cup)
     Lately.

               NICK
          (throwing his jacket 
               on a chair)
     Shit.
          (agitated)
     What's wrong with it?

               BETH
     Water comes out.

               NICK
     Shit.
          (unplugging the coffee 
               maker)
     I hate this shit! It never kept the 
     coffee hot. And now this.

He angrily wraps the cord around the coffee-maker.

               BETH
          (blowing on her coffee)
     It still works.

               NICK
          (adamant)
     No. It doesn't. Water comes out.

               BETH
     Okay.

She sips her coffee. She flips open a box of Dunkin' Donuts.

               NICK
     I could've gotten a new one. On my 
     discount. Now it's too late.

               BETH
     Do you want a donut?

               NICK
          (exasperated)
     No. I want an appliance that works.

Beth shrugs and takes a donut out of the box. She leans 
against the counter, eating the donut.

Nick walks past Beth and jams the coffee maker into the trash.

               NICK
     This coffee maker was junk.

Nick pushes a button on the blender. It makes a horrible 
GRINDING WHINE. He unplugs it.

               NICK
     This blender's junk. Our t.v. is 
     junk!

He jams the blender into the trash.

               NICK
     I don't know why we're even bothering 
     to pack.

               BETH
          (through a mouthful 
               of donut)
     You got me.

               NICK
     The t.v. gets no channels.

               BETH
     And it's fifteen inch.

               NICK
          (shaking his head)
     I can't believe we don't have a big 
     t.v.

               BETH
     We don't watch much.

               NICK
     But at our age...

They stare at each other. Nick picks the almost full pint 
bottle of scotch off the counter and puts it in his jacket 
pocket. Beth takes another donut.

               BETH
     Why don't you take one?

               NICK
     I'm not hungry.

               BETH
          (offhandedly)
     Not a donut. A t.v.

               NICK
     Take a t.v.?

               BETH
     It's your last day.

               NICK
     Like a bonus.

               BETH
     Yeah.

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. NICK AND BETH'S CARPORT - MINUTES LATER

Beth is holding a donut and her coffee mug. Nick tosses his 
jacket into the front seat of his old sedan.

               NICK
     I might do it.

               BETH
     I say do it.
          (after a beat)
     Sears can afford to give you a bonus.

               NICK
     Maybe they are.

               BETH
     What do you mean?

               NICK
     Maybe when I get my check today, 
     there'll be a bonus in it.

               BETH
          (evenly)
     Nick. They fired you.

               NICK
     Yeah...

               BETH
          (flatly)
     There's no bonus.

               NICK
     Yeah... That's true.
          (shaking his head)
     And I sold a lot of teevees for 
     them...

Beth sips her coffee, waiting for Nick to decide.

               BETH
          (calmly)
     You should take a t.v.

Nick looks at his watch.

               NICK
     I should go.
          (sarcastically)
     Don't wanna be late on my last day.

He kisses Beth, surprising her. He presses against her. He 
takes the donut from her hand and takes a bite.

Beth kisses Nick, his mouth still full of donut.

               BETH
     Mmmmm...

He kisses her fully, then breaks the kiss.

               NICK
     I gotta go.

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - MORNING

About hundred cars dot the vast parking lot.

Nick swings into a parking spot and gets out of the car. He 
tosses his jacket on the roof and crouches, tieing his necktie 
using the car's outside mirror.

               MAN'S VOICE
     You livin' in your car or what?

NICK'S POV - IN THE MIRROR

CHIP, a big redheaded guy in his late thirties, wearing a 
jacket and tie, is grinning at the crouched Nick. Nick's 
reflection grins back.

               NICK
     Just waiting for the last second to 
     put on the noose.
          (tightening the tie)
     So Chip -- what's new?

NICK AND CHIP

Nick straightens up and grabs his jacket. They start walking 
toward the mall.

               CHIP
     Nothing much.
          (broaching the subject)
     I heard you're leaving.

               NICK
     Yeah. I'm outta here.

They approach the employees entrance.

               CHIP
     They can you?

               NICK
     That's what they think.

               CHIP
     Yeah?

               NICK
     I was gonna quit anyway -- this way 
     I get unemployment.

               CHIP
     Good deal.

Nick opens the door.

               NICK
     Yeah... recession insurance...
          (Chip enters)
     This way I'm not stuck waiting around 
     for the lay-offs to start.

Nick follows Chip in.

               CHIP
          (a hint of panic)
     Lay-offs?

The door shuts behind him.

                                   CUT TO:

CLOSE-UP - NEWSPAPER

The front page of the Phoenix Sun-Times -- the headline reads 
"Misery Index Soars".

Beth's hand comes INTO FRAME and crumples the page.

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

Beth stuffs the paper in a glass and wraps the glass in 
another piece. She's sitting on the floor, surrounded by 
dishes, newspaper, and cardboard liquor boxes. She adds the 
wrapped glass to a box.

She hears the SOUND of a CAR DOOR SLAMMING, looks up, then 
returns to her packing. She reaches behind herself into the 
trash, pulls out the blender, and begins to wrap it.

At the SOUND of the FRONT DOOR opening, followed by a curious 
METALLIC CLUNKING, she stands and hurries through the swinging 
door to the living room.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The living room is sparsely furnished -- a sofa, a coffee 
table, a bookcase cluttered with a handful of paperbooks, a 
couple of boardgames, a dying cactus, etc. A crappy old 
fifteen inch t.v. on a t.v. tray. WE SEE this for a moment 
before...

A paint-splattered cloth is unfurled FILLING THE SCREEN.

It gently floats down, revealing a PAINTER and his shopping 
cart overloaded with supplies. He's dressed in paint-
splattered clothes. A paint-splattered Red Sox cap is pulled 
low over his eyes, obscuring his face.

Beth stares in disbelief. Without seeing her, the painter 
backs up, his attention focused on spreading the dropcloth.

               BETH
     Who are you?

               SID
          (not looking up)
     The painter.

               BETH
          (agitated)
     What are you doing?

               SID
     Painting.

The painter looks up from the drop-cloth, ready to deal with 
this obstacle. He freezes. His face lights up.

It's Sid.

               SID
          (extremely pleased)
     Well, good morning...

               BETH
          (recognizing him)
     You...

               SID
          (extending a hand)
     Sid. Nice to see you again.

Beth stares in agitated disbelief.

With his untaken extended hand, he pulls a long strip of 
masking tape from a roll around his wrist, masking one side 
of the door frame from top to bottom.

               BETH
     Why are you here?

               SID
     Realty office likes a fresh coat 
     between tenants.

               BETH
          (pointedly)
     We're still here.

He stands on his tiptoes and puts a strip of masking tape on 
the top edge of the doorframe.

               SID
     I've done this house before.
          (admiringly)
     I did a nice job.

He masks the remaining side of the door frame.

               BETH
     Can't you come back tomorrow?

               SID
     Tomorrow's Sunday.

               BETH
     Yeah...?

               SID
     The new people move in on Sunday.
          (conversationally)
     Where are you moving to?

               BETH
          (wearily)
     Billings, Montana.

Sid moves to a window.

               SID
          (incredulous)
     Why?

               BETH
     It can't be worse than Enfield, 
     Arizona.

Sid pulls a strip of tape off the roll.

               SID
          (smiling)
     I've lived in Enfield my whole life.

He holds out the end of the masking tape.

               SID
     Could you hold this?

Beth takes it. He walks backwards, easing a long strip of 
tape off the roll.

               SID
     I use this to mask. Have you ever 
     used masking tape to mask?

He tears the tape off the roll and sticks it to the top of 
the baseboard in one corner.

               BETH
     No. I haven't.

Crouched, he waddles across the room toward Beth, applying 
the masking tape to the baseboard. He gets to Beth, stands 
up, takes the tape off her fingers, and presses it into place.

               SID
     A house like this, it's real easy. 
     Hardly needs a paint job.

               BETH
     You can skip it. I won't tell.

               SID
     It needs a fresh coat...

He hands her the end of the tape again and begins another 
baseboard.

               SID
     ...a little color.

               BETH
          (naturally curious)
     What color is it gonna be?

               SID
     Off-white.

He goes along the floor pressing the masking tape to the 
baseboard.

               BETH
     It's already off-white.

               SID
     No. It's white. It's just dirty.

Beth looks at the walls. He's right.

               SID
     Now if it was my house, I would choose 
     a color...

Beth kneels down, holding the tape, as he arrives at her end 
of the wall.

               SID
     I would not choose off-white.

Beth holds out the tape. They are kneeling next to each other.

               BETH
     What would you choose?

               SID
     The color of your eyes.
          (pause, without looking)
     Hazel.

Beth stares at Sid. Sid looks to Beth. Smiling, he takes the 
tape from her fingers.

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. PIZZA HUT - AFTERNOON

An oasis in the center of a packed mall parking lot. Carol 
hurries toward the front entrance in a snappy skirt and blazer 
combo, a Bullock's name tag attached to her lapel.

INT. PIZZA HUT - CONTINUOUS

Nick is sitting at a booth, a beer in front of him, lost in 
thought.

Carol arrives, drops a gift-wrapped box on the table, and 
scoots into the booth.

               CAROL
     Sorry I'm late, the new girl's a 
     moron.

               NICK
          (looking to the present)
     What's that?

               CAROL
     Going away present.

Nick takes it.

               NICK
     Thanks.

He quickly unwraps it.

               NICK
          (happily)
     A map!

               CAROL
     I thought you might need it.

               NICK
          (unfolding it)
     I do! I had a map -- I lost it.

He spreads the map out over the table.

               CAROL
          (organized)
     Let's highlight your route.

A MAP

of the Western half of the U.S.A. fills the FRAME. Carol's 
hand, holding a bright red felt-tip pen, ENTERS FRAME.

               CAROL (O.S.)
     Here's Enfield.

She circles it. Nick's finger ENTERS FRAME.

               NICK (O.S.)
     Here's Billings.

Carol circles Billings. Nick's finger starts to trace the 
route.

Carol's pen follows, marking the route. Halfway to Billings, 
Nick's finger abruptly stops. Carol stops the pen at the 
same point.

               NICK (O.S.)
     Look at this -- right there -- that's 
     the town I was born in.

NICK AND CAROL

He looks to her for a reaction.

               NICK
          (emphatically)
     Where I grew up. Where my parent's 
     live... Isn't that a coincidence?

               CAROL
     Visit them.

               NICK
          (shaking his head)
     Oh... no...

               CAROL
     You're going to be driving by.

               NICK
     No...
          (shaking his head)
     They're not near the interstate.
          (sort of chagrined)
     I haven't even called them in years.

               CAROL
     You might as well visit.

               NICK
          (adamantly)
     No.
          (shrugging)
     I wouldn't know them.

Nick starts to fold the map -- very unsuccessfully.

               NICK
     Shit.

               CAROL
     Let me.

Nick hands her the map. She deftly folds it in one motion 
and hands it back to him.

               NICK
     Thanks.

He leans over the table and kisses her. She stands.

               CAROL
     I'm starved.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. BETH AND NICK'S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Two of the walls gleam with fresh paint.

Sid is painting with long-handled roller.

Beth, enters, hesitates, and then -- consciously ignoring 
him -- walks by with a packed box and adds it to the stack 
by the front door.

               SID
     I'm lucky I don't have to kill them.

               BETH
          (not a line she was 
               expecting)
     What?

               SID
     If they were dark, I'd have to put a 
     layer of kill down first.

Beth starts back to the kitchen. Sid and THE CAMERA FOLLOW.

               SID
     So the dark paint wouldn't shine 
     through the off-white.

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

The dishes are mostly packed.

               BETH
     Oh.

She picks up two empty liquor boxes.

               SID
     Kill's an oil based paint.

Beth carries the boxes out of the kitchen -- Sid and THE 
CAMERA FOLLOW.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Beth walks right on through followed by the talking Sid and 
THE CAMERA.

               SID
     It covers the old paint so that you'd 
     never know it was there, but it gives 
     off fumes when it's drying.

Beth goes into the small hallway, Sid and THE CAMERA FOLLOW.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Beth walks toward the bedroom, Sid right behind her.

               SID
     Noxious fumes. They would find us on 
     the floor unconscious.

They enter the bedroom, THE CAMERA FOLLOWING.

INT. BEDROOM

There's a queen-sized bed, a bureau, a mirror, and a closet.

Beth takes the boxes to the closet.

               BETH
     They?

Sid sits on the bed, checking it's firmness.

               SID
     The "they" that find people...

               BETH
          (interjecting)
     Nick.

               SID
     ...unconscious.

               BETH
          (flatly)
     Nick.
          (after a beat)
     The man I live with.

               SID
          (smiling)
     I guess he'd be the "they".

               BETH
     He'd find us. And he'd be surprised.

Sid gets off the bed and with a grin, gingerly pats out the 
wrinkles he's made in the bed spread.

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

Nick and Carol are walking away from the Pizza Hut, across a 
huge parking lot, toward a large mall. Cars circle past them, 
searching for close spots.

               NICK
          (doggedly)
     It was the drive that killed us. San 
     Antonio to Seattle is just too many 
     hours in a car. If we'd have flown, 
     we would've made it.

               CAROL
          (shaking her head)
     No...

               NICK
     Things were all right in bed.

               CAROL
     But the rest of the time they were... 
     awful.

               NICK
          (hurt)
     Really?

               CAROL
          (flatly)
     Nick. We couldn't stand each other. 
     We stopped in Enfield and just stayed.

               NICK
          (after a beat)
     Why didn't you go on to Seattle? It 
     was your car.

Carol stops. On her face, the answer to his question is clear -- 
she was stuck on Nick then and she's still stuck on him now.

But she'd never let him know that.

               CAROL
          (dryly)
     Big trees scare me.

She starts walking. Nick hurries up beside her. They walk 
side by side for a few paces before the shotdown Nick comes 
up with a new ploy to win favor.

               NICK
          (casually)
     I'm thinking about stealing a t.v.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. NICK AND BETH'S BEDROOM HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

Beth's taking extra sheets and towels from the linen closet 
and packing them in liquor boxes.

Sid enters from the living room.

               SID
          (cheerfully)
     I'm done in there. I won't paint the 
     ceiling 'til you've moved the 
     furniture out.

               BETH
     I don't think we're going to take 
     much of the furniture.

               SID
     No?

               BETH
     It's ugly.

               SID
     I kind of like the sofa.

               BETH
     It's a sofa bed.

               SID
     You're not going to take it?

               BETH
          (flatly)
     It weighs two thousand pounds.

               SID
     Can I have it?

               BETH
     It's yours.

               SID
     Excellent.

INT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The furniture is kind of ugly, but the walls look great. The 
whole room seems brighter, almost magically more cheerful.

Sid runs into the room and flops onto the sofa. He settles 
in and sighs contentedly.

The front door BURSTS open. Sid leaps up.

Carol races into the room.

               CAROL
          (excited)
     Nick's gonna steal a t.v.!

She sees Sid and freezes.

               CAROL
     Who are you?

               SID
     The painter.

Beth hurries into the living room.

               BETH
          (excitedly)
     He's really gonna do it?

               CAROL
     He says yes.

Carol glances pointedly at Sid then returns her attention to 
Beth.

               CAROL
          (conspiratorilly)
     We've got to talk.

               SID
          (piping in)
     About the crime?

               CAROL
          (sharply)
     There's no crime.

               SID
     Nick's gonna steal a t.v.

               CAROL
     That's just an expression.

               SID
     I've never heard that expression.

               CAROL
          (witheringly)
     It's making the rounds. College 
     students use it.

               SID
          (to Beth)
     Where's he stealing it from?

               BETH
     Sears.

               CAROL
          (incredulous)
     You want him to know?

               BETH
     He knows. He doesn't care.
          (to Sid)
     Do you care?

               SID
          (enthusiastically)
     I'm interested. Crime's interesting. 
     I read the papers.

               BETH
     It's not a crime.

               CAROL
     It's justice.

               BETH
     Poetic justice.

               SID
     How?

               BETH
     They fired him.

               SID
          (deducing)
     He's got motive.

               CAROL
          (exasperated)
     Who is this guy?!

               BETH
     The painter.

               SID
          (helpfully)
     Sid.

He holds out a hand to shake. Carol stares at his outstretched 
hand.

               CAROL
          (point blank)
     No.

Carol takes Beth by the arm and leads her away from Sid. She 
stares back over her shoulder at Sid.

Taking the hint, he begins to stir a can of paint, assuming 
an air of indifference. Carol turns her attention back to 
Beth.

               CAROL
          (purposefully)
     He needs you at the store.

               BETH

Nick is standing next to RORY, a precocious eight year old

Nick and Rory talk, the soap ACTOR and ACTRESS passionately 
embrace.

               NICK
     You lookin' or buyin'?

               RORY
     Lookin'. I hate television.

               NICK

     I do.

               NICK
          (laying it out)
     You see... you go to a movie, you're 
     there.

Rory listens attentively.

               NICK
     You watch t.v., you're thirteen places 
     at once. As many channels as you 
     get, that's as many places as you 
     are. You get cable? You're forty 
     places at once. You get a satellite 
     dish?...

     You're all over the world.

               NICK
     Exactly.

In the BACKGROUND, on the big screen t.v., the soap actress 
breaks the embrace and points a gun at the actor.

               NICK
     You're everywhere.

The soap actress shoots the actor. He stares at her in 
overacting disbelief and slumps to the floor.

               NICK
     It's called freedom.

Carol watches as Sid whistles cheerfully, ripping the long 
strips of masking tape off the trim.

               CAROL
          (w/ attitude)
     This is what you do?

               SID
     I also mow lawns.

               CAROL
     Which is your career?

               SID
     Painting. I'm an inside person.
          (confidentially)
     Mowing grass is seasonal.

               CAROL
          (dryly)
     That is true.

Sid wads the tape into a big ball.

               SID

     You've got a nice tan.

               CAROL

     I work on it.

Sid shoots the tape ball into his shopping cart of supplies.

               SID
     Do you want to get stoned?

Carol thinks for a moment. It's been a long time and she's 
not crazy about him being there.

               CAROL
          (after a beat)
     Yeah.

Sid takes a joint out of his shirt pocket.

               SID
     This kind of painting -- for people 
     I won't know -- it's boring.
          (lighting the joint)
     It's not very good. It's homegrown.

He takes a drag.

               CAROL
     Yeah?

               SID
     But it'll get you fucked up.

He hands the joint to Carol.

CAROL

takes a drag on the joint like an old pro.

               SID (O.S.)
     It'll take you someplace.

INT. APPLIANCE CENTER - LATER

Nick and MAJOR JENKINS, a uniformed military man in his late 
forties, are standing in front of a wall of silent color 
televisions. On the t.v.s a nearly identical pairs of LOCAL 
ANCHORS smile their way through the news.

               NICK
     Have you thought about American?

               MAJOR JENKINS
     No.

               NICK
     I own an American set. I'm very 
     satisfied.

               MAJOR JENKINS
     I want Japanese.

               NICK
     I'll tell you...

Nick put his arm around the man's shoulder and guides him 
toward a display case.

               NICK
     ...the thing is, a hundred and fifty 
     dollars gets you very little in the 
     way of Japanese technology.

               MAJOR JENKINS
     Oh.

They stop at the case. Nick points.

               NICK
     It would get you that t.v.

CLOSE-UP

A tiny two inch Casio television playing "Gilligan's Island".

NICK AND JENKINS

Nick looks to see the Jenkin's reaction. Jenkins stares 
dumbfounded at the tiny t.v. He looks to Nick.

               MAJOR JENKINS
     It's for my parents.

               NICK
     Your parents?

               MAJOR JENKINS
     Yes. They live with me...

Beth enters the FRAME. Nick doesn't see her.

               MAJOR JENKINS
     ...and they want Japanese.

Nick stifles a strange urge to giggle. Beth tries to subtly 
get Nick's attention.

               MAJOR JENKINS
     Is there a problem?

               NICK
          (controlling the 
               giggles)
     No... I, uh, just never think of 
     adults as having parents.

               MAJOR JENKINS
          (flatly)
     They do.

               NICK
          (agreeably)
     I know...

Beth fake coughs to get his attention. Nick sees her.

               NICK
     I'm an adult, I have parents.

Nick turns to Beth with a burst of salesman cheer.

               NICK
     Oh, Miss, I've got your receipt!

Beth approaches them, still not sure what Nick's up to.

               BETH
          (acting cheerful)
     Oh... great!

Nick holds out the receipt.

               NICK
     This is all you need.

Beth takes the receipt.

               BETH
          (puzzled, but playing 
               along)
     Thanks...

               NICK
          (personably)
     Now you just take this receipt out, 
     give it to the guys at the loading 
     dock and they'll give you your brand 
     new beautiful television set.

               BETH
          (thrown)
     I get the t.v...?

               NICK
          (cheerfully)
     Out back. They'll help load it in 
     your car and everything.

               BETH
          (flatly)
     I get the t.v.

               NICK
     Out back.

Nick turns his full attention to the man.

               NICK
     Think about American. They're mostly 
     Japanese parts anyway.

Beth stares at Nick, amazed that he's managed to come up 
with a plan that has her taking the television.

               BETH
     Excuse me, I just...

               NICK
          (interrupting, 
               pleasantly)

     here, perhaps you might...
          (firmly, a salesman's 
               put-off)
     You might want to see someone else.

               BETH
          (pointedly)
     You can't help me?

               BETH (O.S.)
     Nick sold a demo, wrote it up like a 
     new set, and gave me the receipt.

As Sid's jacknife ENTERS FRAME and zips through the packing 
tape, THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal...

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The sun is low, giving the room a golden glow.

Sid and Beth are sitting on the sofa, the t.v. box on the 
floor in front of them.

Sid opens the television box. Slowly, he pulls out the sheets 
of bubbled packing plastic. He pops several of the bubbles.

               SID
          (savoring the bubble 
               plastic)
     Excellent.

               BETH
     Maybe I should just leave it packed...

               SID
     C'mon! You stole it. You gotta see 
     it! Hold the box.

Beth holds the box. Sid starts to lift out the television.

               SID
          (urgently)
     Wait!

Beth looks to him, anxiously.

               SID
     I thought I heard the police.

Beth listens, nervously. Sid grins.

               BETH
     Ha ha ha.
          (an amused realization)
     You're stoned!

               SID
          (innocently)
     Me?

               BETH
     You're being silly and you've got 
     bunny eyes.

Embarrassed, Sid pulls Visine from a pocket and drips it in 
his eyes as he speaks.

               SID
     I'm a little stoned... not that 
     stoned.

               BETH
     No?

               SID
     No.
          (after a beat)
     Carol's really stoned.

               BETH
     You got Carol stoned?

               SID
     Very stoned.

               BETH
     I didn't think she liked you.

               SID
     She doesn't. But she likes getting 
     stoned.

               BETH
          (smiling)
     She does.

               SID
     There's nothing like drugs to create 
     a quick and shallow friendship.

Beth laughs.

               SID
          (rubbing his hands)
     Let's look at the loot.

Sid pulls the t.v. up and out of the box. He sits back on 
the sofa, the t.v. in his lap.

The t.v. is spectacular -- huge, metallic, and ultra-modern.

               SID
          (very impressed)
     Jesus... you didn't fool around.

               BETH
          (w/ mixed emotions)
     This is the nicest thing I've ever 
     owned.

Beth stares at the television. Sid stares at Beth. She meets 
his eyes, then looks quickly back to the television.

He jerks his necktie loose and slips it over his head. He

Sid takes the remote from Beth and turns the VOLUME UP very 
loud.

               SID

Carol enters through the front door, unseen by the mesmerized

Carol stares at them for a long moment.

     Hi, kids.

Startled, Sid and Beth jump back. They look at each other 
and laugh.

Beth turns the VOLUME DOWN as Carol comes and looks at the 
t.v.

Carol looks to Beth, a quizzical expression on her face.

Beth turns off the t.v. There's a moment of awkward silence 
as they all stare at the blank screen.

     I better get set up in the kitchen.

He goes to his shopping cart of supplies. Carol and Beth 
stare at the television.

The television stares back at them, gleamingly modern.

     It makes teevee seem very futuristic.

               SID
          (at the kitchen door)
     That's 'cause you're stoned.

catches it.

Carol tilts back her head and manuevers the Visine.

     Shit. Missed the eye, got the face.

               BETH
     Need help?

     Tilt your head back.

     He really wants to get in your pants.

               BETH

She tilts Carol's head back.

               BETH
     Why don't you go for him?

               CAROL
     He likes you.

Beth puts a drop in Carol's eye. Carol flinches and rubs her 
eye.

               BETH
     I wish Nick would get back and help 
     with the packing.

She sighs, cheerfully exasperated.

               BETH
     He's probably getting drunk with the 
     stockboys...
          (after a beat)
     That's what he's probably doing.

Carol braces herself.

          (badly shaken)
     Where'd he call from?

               CAROL
     He said the highway.

Beth takes a deep breath, controlling her emotions.

               BETH
     I have to do something.

               CAROL
     I'll help.

     I've got to be out of here Sunday. 
     That's tomorrow.

He fumbles the cigarette into the ashtray.

He takes a pint of scotch from the front seat, uncaps it, 
takes a slug, takes another slug, recaps it, and drops it 
back on the seat.

He stares at the road. He looks down to the front seat and 
finds the map. He splits his attention between the road and 
unfolding the map. The wind catches the map.

The map billows up, covering his face. Losing control of the 
car, Nick slaps it down.

A car HORN blares.

Nick jerks the car back into his lane, bats the map down 
again, and pulls off to the side of the road.

He stops the car and slams the shift into park.

He opens his door a crack, turning on the dome light. He 
smooths out the map on the dashboard.

Billings and Enfield are marked with Carol's big red circles.

CLOSE-UP - THE MAP

Nick's finger traces from Enfield toward Billings along the 
route Carol highlighted with the red felt-tip. Halfway to 
Billings, the red line stops. Nick's finger stops.

NICK

He stares at the map.

INT. BETH'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Beth comes in the front door. The sound of Sid whistling 
comes softly from the kitchen.

Beth stares at the t.v. for a moment then strides purposefully 
toward the kitchen.

INT. BETH'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Sid is standing on the counter masking the top sill of the 
kitchen window. There's half a donut hanging from his mouth.

Beth comes through the swinging door.

               BETH
          (forcefully)
     You've lived here your whole life?

The half-donut falls from the startled Sid's mouth.

               SID
          (after a beat)
     Yeah.

               BETH
          (increduously)
     You've never gone anywhere?

He picks up the half-donut.

               SID
     Travelling has no allure for me.

               BETH
     None?

Sid climbs down and sits on the counter, dropping the half-
donut back into the donut box.

               SID
     Maybe through time.

               BETH
          (smiling)
     That's not offered.

               SID
     So I stay here.

               BETH
     Why?

               SID
          (the simple truth)
     It's my home. I belong here.

               BETH
     I'm serious.

So was Sid -- but he realizes Beth doesn't believe it can be 
as simple as that.

               SID
     My father says if you stay in one 
     place long enough your luck knows 
     where to find you.

               BETH
          (wryly)
     Maybe that's my problem.

               SID
          (carefully)
     Maybe it is...

Sid holds out the box of donuts to her.

               BETH
     Thanks.

She takes a donut and fiddles with it.

               BETH
     You think your father knows the truth?

               SID
     He's a bartender.
          (smiling)
     He's lived here his whole life.

               BETH
     Has his luck found him?

               SID
     Not yet.
          (after a beat)
     But it's probably very close.

Beth smiles weakly. Abruptly, she drops her donut back in 
the box.

               SID
          (cautiously)
     Are you all right?

               BETH
          (apologetically)
     Must be the paint fumes...

She opens up the back door and steps out. Sid stares at the 
empty doorway.

EXT. BACK STOOP - CONTINUOUS

Beth stands in the moonlight, staring out at the stars.

               BETH
          (contemplatively 
               dubious)
     You find what you want here?

Sid steps out behind her.

               SID
     It seems that way.

               BETH
     Yeah?

               SID
          (simply)
     I found you.

               BETH
     Oh. No...

She walks out into the backyard. Sid follows her.

               SID
          (earnestly)
     We never met before last night...

The moonlight through the orange trees casts a magical air 
about the backyard. Beth stops by a swingset.

               SID
     ...but we know each other.

Beth stiffens.

               BETH
     No...

She walks away from him. He watches her intently.

               SID
     Leave it behind.

She looks to him.

               BETH
     Leave what behind?

               SID
     Unhappiness.

               BETH
          (amused)
     That was a bad answer.

               SID
          (seriously)
     No. It was true.

Beth stares at Sid.

               BETH
     It's not.

               SID
     Come hold me.
          (after a beat)
     Come hold me, and you'll be happy.

               BETH
          (dryly)
     I'll find happiness. Right. In your 
     arms.

               SID
     Yes.

               BETH
     In you.

               SID
     Yes.

               BETH
     But I won't. I have to find happiness 
     in myself.

               SID
     No. That's wrong.
          (going toward her)
     People tell you that, but it's wrong.

She turns away from him. He stands behind her, close.

               SID
     I've lived with people who have that 
     happiness from within. That happiness -- 
     it's just them being pleased with 
     themselves. It's not enough. It's a 
     lonely thing.

She turns and faces him. The moonlight casts a pale glow 
over them.

She stares in his eyes for a long moment. She steps back 
from him.

               BETH
     You're showing how young you are.

               SID
     No. I'm not. I'm showing you a way. 
     You know that. And you know me.
          (after a beat)
     And I know you.

She walks away from him, back to the swingset.

               BETH
     I don't know you.

Sid follows and takes her arms, turning her to face him.

               SID
     You know.

               BETH
          (after a beat, 
               defensively)
     I know you want to fuck me.

He pulls her very close. He lets go of her arms so she is 
standing against him, unrestrained.

               SID
     Is that what you know?

Beth stares at his face for a long time.

               BETH
     I know...

She kisses him, suddenly, long and slow.

               BETH
          (whispering)
     I know you.

They kiss, pulling each other tight.

They lose their balance and stagger against the swingset, 
kissing passionately. Beth pulls back.

               BETH
          (w/ fierce intensity)
     I know you.

               SID
     That's right.

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. TWO-STORY SUBURBAN RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT

A canopy of stars hangs over it.

INT. NICK'S SEDAN - CONTINUOUS

Nick is parked, staring at the house. The roadmap is on the 
seat beside him. He takes a drink from a half empty pint of 
scotch. He screws the cap on and drops the bottle on the 
map.

He steps out of the car, unsteadily.

EXT. RANCH HOUSE'S FRONT LAWN - CONTINUOUS

Nick walks toward the door. He stops, stares at the door and 
starts back for his car. He stops, shakes his head, and walks 
quickly to the front door.

FRONT PORCH

Nick stands, staring at the door. He knocks. He waits 
impatiently, then pounds on the door. On his third pound the 
lights in the house suddenly go on.

OVER NICK'S SHOULDER

The door abruptly opens.

MR. AUGUST, an eighty year old man, stands in the doorway. 
HE wears pajamas, slippers, and a long robe. He is over six 
and a half feet tall.

NICK AND MR. AUGUST

Nick, startled, steps back. Mr. August stares at him. Nick 
composes himself.

               NICK
     Excuse me...

Mr. August stares at him.

               NICK
     Excuse me... I'm... I'm looking for 
     my parents.

Mr. August calmly puts his hands over his ears, and slowly 
shakes his head.

               NICK
     My mother, my father... they...

ELIZABETH, a fifteen year old girl steps out from behind Mr. 
August. She seems very small next to Mr. August. He puts a 
hand on her shoulder. She stares at Nick.

               NICK
          (uncomfortably)
     Hello.

               ELIZABETH
     Hello.

               NICK
          (exhaling in relief)
     Oh... good...
          (to the point)
     This is my house. I, uhh... mean 
     this is the house I grew up in.

Nick looks past them into the house.

               ELIZABETH
          (nodding to Mr. August)
     This is his house now.

               NICK
     Nice to meet you.

He holds out a hand to Mr. August, who slowly shakes it.

               ELIZABETH
     He's deaf.

               NICK
          (loudly)
     Nice to meet you.

               ELIZABETH
     He's stone deaf.

               NICK
     Oh.
          (uncomfortably)
     Yelling doesn't help.

               ELIZABETH
     No.

Nick breaks the handshake. Mr. August smiles at him. Nick 
looks to Elizabeth.

               NICK
     My name is Nick, Nick Brennan.

He waits for her to introduce herself. She doesn't.

               NICK
     Did you know the Brennans?

               ELIZABETH
     No.

               NICK
     They lived here. They used to live 
     here. I used to live here with them...

Elizabeth stares at him. Nick tries his salesman charm.

               NICK
     What's your name?

               ELIZABETH
     Elizabeth.

               NICK
     No...

               ELIZABETH
     Yes.

               NICK
     I know an Elizabeth.
          (quietly)
     I call her Beth.

INT. BETH'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Bathed in moonlight, Sid and Beth make tender passionate 
love.

Sid has never wanted someone so much and Beth has never felt 
so wanted.

Beth clings to Sid as if she were afraid of being swept 
away... and then she is.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MR. AUGUST'S DINING ROOM - LATER

A chandelier casts a gently sparkling golden glow.

The CAMERA TILTS down to reveal...

Mr. August, Elizabeth and Nick, sitting at a large antique 
dining room table.

Nick is eating a sandwich, an untouched glass of milk in 
front of him. Mr. August and Elizabeth watch him, expectantly. 
Nick notices this.

               NICK
          (swallowing)
     This is a good sandwich.

               ELIZABETH
     Thank you.

               NICK
          (abruptly nodding 
               toward Mr. August)
     When did he move here? Would he know 
     where the people before him went?

               ELIZABETH
     No. He wouldn't remember.

               NICK
     You're sure?

               ELIZABETH
     Yes. He doesn't remember anymore.

               NICK
     Oh.
          (taking a deep breath)
     He can't help me.

               ELIZABETH
     No.

Nick looks around the familiar room, struck by the absurdity 
of the situation.

               NICK
          (with wry awareness)
     I've lost my parents.

Nick smiles weakly at Elizabeth.

               ELIZABETH
          (matter-or-factly)
     Did you lose them both at the same 
     time?

               NICK
     Is that like a joke?

               ELIZABETH
     No.

               NICK
     Then yes. I lost them both at the 
     same time.

               ELIZABETH
     I lost mine one at a time.
          (after a beat)
     Last year.

Nick realizes she's talking about death.

               NICK
     I'm sorry. That's tragic. I should...

               ELIZABETH
          (interrupting)
     Six months apart. Body failures. 
     Separate body failures.

               NICK
     I'm really sorry.
          (standing)
     I should go.

Mr. August slowly stands as Elizabeth follows Nick toward 
the foyer.

               ELIZABETH
     First my father's heart kept starting 
     and stopping.

               NICK
          (nodding)
     Attacks...

IN THE FOYER

Nick edges toward the door followed by Elizabeth and Mr. 
August.

               ELIZABETH
     My mother and I were with him in the 
     hospital and he'd grab at us, he'd 
     grab my arms and hold on.

               NICK
     That's very sad...
          (after a beat, backing 
               toward the door)
     I've really gotta be going. I, uh... 
     thank you again for the sandwich. 
     Delicious...

               ELIZABETH
     Right before my mother died, she 
     said -- "Elizabeth. You're adopted."

Nick stops in his tracks, his hand on the doorknob.

               NICK
     Have you found your real parents?

               ELIZABETH
     No. Two are enough to lose.

Nick stares at her -- the sad truth of her statement sinking 
in.

               ELIZABETH
     I'm not alone. I have my Grandfather.

Nick looks down. He is alone. He has no one.

               NICK
          (opening the door)
     Listen...

He looks into her eyes.

Elizabeth suddenly grabs his arm.

He stares at her, not knowing what to do. She holds his arm 
tightly for a moment, then lets go.

               ELIZABETH
     I'm sorry.

She steps back from Nick, against her grandfather.

               ELIZABETH
          (in explanation)
     He's stone deaf.

Nick stares at Elizabeth.

               NICK
     I have to go.

And he hurries out the door into the night.

INT. BETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Beth is sitting up in bed, Sid leaning back against her, her 
arms wrapped around him.

               SID
          (after a beat)
     I'd like to stay right here...

               BETH
     I have to be out tomorrow.

               SID
     In this moment... Enjoying this 
     moment.

They both lie perfectly still. A flicker of sadness crosses 
Beth's face.

               BETH
          (hushed)
     The moment's gone.

               SID
          (shaking his head)
     It can go on as long as we want.

Beth leans him back, cradling him in her arms. She stares at 
him, a quizzical expression on her face.

               BETH
          (skeptically)
     Have you ever been in a relationship?

               SID
     No.
          (after a beat)
     I was married... but it wasn't really 
     a relationship.

               BETH
          (incredulous)
     You weren't married...

               SID
     Two years. Right out of high school.

Beth ponders this for a moment.

               BETH
     Do I remind you of her?

               SID
     No.

               BETH
          (relieved)
     Thank God.

Sid runs his hands over her body.

               SID
     You have beautiful skin... her skin 
     was polka-dotted.

               BETH
     Freckled...

               SID
     When we were kids we called her 
     "Spot".

               BETH
          (laughing)
     What happened?

               SID
     She disappeared.

Beth looks to Sid. He's staring off.

               BETH
          (after a beat)
     Was she ever found?

A flicker of loss crosses his face.

               SID
     No. Not by me...
          (looking to Beth)
     I didn't go look.

Beth stares at him, uncertainly. He leans up and gently traces 
circles on Beth's skin.

               SID
     She wanted to meet someone new. I 
     asked her "why?" -- she said, "Because 
     he won't know me from before. Just 
     now. Just what I am now."

Beth looks to him, puzzled.

               SID
     I knew her... on playgrounds... in 
     Sunday School... all those grades -- 
     I knew her as she changed. But she 
     was still the same person. All the 
     times I knew her, she was still her.
          (after a beat)
     She can't get away from that.

He holds Beth tightly.

               SID
     You stay in one place, and all those 
     things that are you... are there. 
     She didn't understand that if you 
     leave, they're still there, in you -- 
     but they stop being clear. You stop 
     knowing who you are, and what you 
     want.

               BETH
     You've stayed here and you know who 
     you are?

He moves away from Beth.

               SID
     I see the lawns I mow, houses I've 
     painted, faces I know... my parents... 
     And I'm constantly reminded of who I 
     am.

               BETH
     And you know what you want.

               SID
     I want you.

               BETH
     Oh.

               SID
     I want to be inside you.

               BETH
     Good.
          (after a beat)
     Come here and put it inside me.

               SID
     No... I want to be able to put myself 
     inside of you.

               BETH
     Doing this is as close as you get.

Beth pulls Sid close, bringing him into her.

               BETH
     Come here.

               SID
     I love you.

She holds him tightly.

               BETH
     Come inside me.

Sid arches away from her.

               SID
     Beth?

               BETH
     Yes?

               SID
     What do you want?

               BETH
          (uncertainly)
     I want... I want...

Beth pulls Sid back to her.

               BETH
          (w/ quiet urgency)
     Come inside me.

They hold each other tightly.

INT./EXT. NICK'S SEDAN - NIGHT

Nick looks like hell -- his eyes red, his hair a mess. The 
nearly empty scotch bottle is on the dashboard.

The car windows are open, the roar of the wind competing 
with the blasting radio.

Nick suddenly jerks the wheel over.

EXT. ABANDONED REST STOP - CONTINUOUS

The sedan screeches off the highway into the abandoned rest 
area.

It stops facing a battered phone booth -- the engine turns 
off but the headlines stay shining on the phone booth.

IN THE SEDAN

Nick turns off the radio. It is suddenly very quiet -- only 
the occasional lonely DRONE OF A TRUCK passing on the highway. 
He takes a deep breath.

INT. PHONE BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER

Nick is standing in the phone booth, harshly lit by his 
headlights.

               NICK
          (into the phone)
     Could you give me the number for 
     information in Arizona?... Thank 
     you.

Nick dials with drunken concentration.

               NICK
          (into the phone)
     Enfield. Carol, Carol, umm...
          (mortified)
     Carol... Carol Something... Shit!

He hangs up. He hits himself in the head in angry disbelief. 
He hurriedly dials zero and listens for a moment, desperately 
summoning up all his salesman charm.

               NICK
          (into the phone)
     Hello Janet, thank you for being my 
     operator. I hope you can help me, I 
     need to call my home.

Nick listens impatiently.

               NICK
     Well, I'll tell you my number, but 
     there's a problem. My phone's been 
     disconnected, not because of bills, 
     I mean we paid all our bills. We 
     were hardly ever even late. We were 
     very good customers, but we're moving, 
     so we had the phone disconnected. 
     But now I need to call... the woman 
     I live with. She's still there and 
     I've got to let her know where I am.

Nick listens, shaking his head emphatically.

               NICK
     I don't know any of the neighbors. I 
     know one, but I can't remember her 
     last name.
          (he listens, frustrated)
     No. No. No. You see you have to be 
     able to help me, this is not a prank, 
     it's my home phone, this is an 
     emergency.
          (he listens, then 
               urgently)
     Yes it can, it can be done. Someone 
     there can hook the phone back up. 
     It's not like a phone guy came to 
     our house to disconnect the phone, 
     nobody came to our house, someone 
     just flipped a switch somewhere, 
     somewhere there where you work, or 
     plugged something into a computer 
     and our phone stopped working!
          (he listens)
     They turned it off, they can turn it 
     back on!
          (he listens, starting 
               to panic)
     I know it's the week-end! I know! 
     Call them at home! They'll have a 
     computer at their house, they'll 
     have a phone thing to hook it up to 
     the real computer! That's how these 
     people live! They'll be glad to do 
     it!...

Nick listens. Suddenly all his energy drains away.

               NICK
          (crestfallen)
     No. No. I can't have the police go 
     to the house. That won't work, there 
     are circumstances.
          (desperately)
     It's you... you've got to help me! 
     Please! I've gotta call home! I can't 
     wait. It could be too late! Janet!! 
     You've gotta help me! Please! You 
     can reconnect me. Please!! Don't 
     hang up! Don't hang up!!

He hurls the receiver at the phone.

               NICK
     You fucker!! You heartless...

Nick doubles over, retching, clutching the side of the booth.

               TELEPHONE RECORDING
     "If you'd like to make a call, please 
     hang up and try again. If you need 
     help..."

                                                  CUT TO BLACK:

FADE IN:

INT. BETH'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Sid is sprawled out over the bed, sleeping, Beth nestled 
against him. She stirs and cuddles closer.

Suddenly she realizes it's not Nick. She pulls away, 
orientating herself. She quickly scoots out of bed and 
hurriedly pulls on a pair of jeans.

The alarm clock CLANGS.

Beth looks about for the alarm. She tensely scatters some 
boxes. She dumps one, finds the alarm and shuts it off. She 
stares at the clock and drops it into a box.

               SID (O.S.)
          (cheerfully)
     Morning.

Beth cringes slightly and turns to face Sid.

SID AND BETH

               BETH
          (attempting a smile)
     Hi.

               SID
          (grinning)
     Hi.

               BETH
     I didn't want to wake you.

               SID
          (cheerfully)
     I'm awake. I'm a morning person.

               BETH
     I'm not.

               SID
     Then why don't you come back to bed?

               BETH
     I've got to pack.

               SID
          (sitting up)
     Where do we start?

               BETH
          (firmly)
     No.
          (softening)
     You paint.

She looks around the room littered with boxes and piles of 
clothes.

               BETH
     I'll manage.

               SID
          (cheerfully)
     Whatever you say.

Sid gets out of bed, wrapping the sheet around himself. Beth 
stares at the room. She suddenly trembles. She steadies 
herself on the bed table.

               BETH
     Oh God...

               SID
          (concerned)
     What?

Beth avoids his eyes, glancing around the room.

               BETH
          (an outpouring)
     I'd be so much happier if I could 
     blame this on Nick, but it always 
     happens to me. I'm always left with 
     nothing.
          (taking a deep breath)
     It doesn't matter if I leave the guy 
     or if the guy leaves me -- I'm left 
     with nothing. I never do anything 
     for myself. I never acquire anything. 
     I mean Nick didn't take from me. He 
     stole a t.v. and left it for me. He 
     didn't take my things, he didn't 
     take our things... he didn't even 
     take his clothes! And I'll still 
     leave this house with nothing!

               SID
     He took three years from you.

               BETH
     No...
          (meeting his eyes)
     He didn't take 'em. I mean, when he 
     cared about me, he cared about me. 
     And he was really good in bed.

She glances away from Sid toward the bed.

               BETH
          (after a beat)
     I didn't expect more.

She turns away from Sid and the bed. Sid moves toward her.

               SID
          (carefully)
     Beth...

Beth summons up all the composure she can manage.

               BETH
          (referring to the 
               cluttered room)
     I can't face this.
          (looking to Sid)
     I'm gonna finish up the kitchen...
          (heading for the door)
     ...get some momentum...

She goes out the bedroom door. Sid stares after her.

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. ABANDONED REST STOP - MORNING

Nick's sedan is parked in the same place as the night before.

A YOUNG MAN with long hair ROARS into the rest stop on a 
Harley-Davidson, his life's possession strapped on the back.

He stops the bike between Nick's car and the phonebooth, 
idling the engine, loudly. He looks to the phonebooth, the 
receiver dangling. He turns to Nick's sedan.

               YOUNG MAN
     Phone work?

NICK

Awakened by the ROAR, Nick has wearily leaned his head out 
the window.

Nick stares at the young man.

               NICK
          (after a beat)
     No.

Drained, Nick rests his head on the steering wheel.

OFFSCREEN, the motorcycle starts up and zooms away. A silence 
falls over the rest stop.

Without raising his head from the steering wheel, Nick starts 
the car.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. BETH'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Sid is making the bed.

               CAROL (V.O.)
          (gleefully 
               conspiratorially)
     How was he?

               BETH (V.O.)
          (sheepishly)
     He's twenty-four.

Sid pulls up the blanket and fluffs the pillows.

               CAROL (V.O.)
     A little weak on tenderness, but 
     long on juice?

               BETH (V.O.)
     Long on conversation.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. BETH'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

The cupboards are all open and bare. A half dozen boxes are 
neatly stacked. Beth is sitting on the floor packing the 
final dishes. Carol holds out a mug of coffee.

               CAROL
     Did you need talk?

Beth stands and takes the coffee.

               BETH
     Yeah. I guess I did.

               CAROL
     Good.

Beth sips her coffee, gazing out the kitchen window.

BETH'S POV

The backyard. In the light of day it's lost its magical 
quality. The grass needs cutting and is marred by brown 
patches. The swingset looks pathetically rusted and 
dilapidated.

CLOSE-UP: BETH

Her face clouds over.

               CAROL (O.S.)
          (cheerfully)
     So what are we doing?

BETH AND CAROL

Carol is staring at Beth staring out at the backyard.

               BETH
     Christ...

She turns to Carol.

               BETH
          (w/ an edge of 
               desperation)
     I gotta get out here. I was in Tucson 
     two years before you and Nick got 
     here.
          (in disbelief)
     I've been here five years...

               CAROL
     Yeah...

               BETH
     This state's driving me crazy.

               CAROL
     So what are you gonna do?

               BETH
     I've got no money.

               CAROL
     I've got some.

               BETH
          (chagrined by self-
               awareness)
     I can't take it. I mean you're being 
     great, but I can't take it. I'm gonna 
     be gone, we won't see each other, 
     and I won't send the money. I won't. 
     I know... I won't get around, I'll 
     forget, I won't do it.

She looks around the room in disgust.

               BETH
          (agitated)
     Shit. I'll sell all this shit. I 
     don't want any of it, just my car 
     and my clothes...

               CAROL
          (carefully)
     Okay...

               BETH
          (shaking her head)
     I'm sorry... I shouldn't have fucked 
     this kid last night. I should have 
     slept. Now I've got all this stuff 
     to do, and I'm tired, I'm churned 
     up, I'm in a fuckin' mood.

               CAROL
     Let's do things, get you busy.

               BETH
     Yeah.

               CAROL
     You get all the stuff you wanna sell, 
     and I'll make some tag sale signs.

               BETH
     No one'll buy my stuff. It's all 
     junk.

               CAROL
     That's what people buy at tag sales. 
     Broken appliances, ugly knicknacks.

Beth looks at the semi-packed boxes.

               BETH
          (laughing)
     I guess I do have stuff to sell.

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. BETH'S FRONT LAWN - DAY

Boxes full of a motley collection of knickknacks, housewares, 
and crummy appliances are spread out on the lawn.

In the BACKGROUND a couple of M.T.V. influenced teens are 
checking out the knickknacks and goofing on them.

MRS. DOTSON, a woman in her late forties wearing a NURSE'S 
UNIFORM is poking through the odds and ends.

Beth and Carol hovering near her.

Mrs. Dotson picks up the coffee maker, examines it, and puts 
it down. She picks up the blender, examines it, and puts it 
down.

               CAROL
          (impatiently)
     Is there something specific you're 
     looking for?

               MRS. DOTSON
     Yes.
          (sheepishly)
     Actually everything... I don't have 
     anything.

               BETH
     Nothing?

               MRS. DOTSON
     I just moved to town.
          (hesitating then 
               confiding)
     My husband passed away, and I, umm, 
     didn't want to have our things... 
     they were too familiar.

Beth realizes why she's selling all her stuff -- it's too 
familiar.

               BETH
          (abruptly)
     You can have it all for three hundred. 
     The stuff in these boxes and 
     everything inside.

               MRS. DOTSON
          (taken aback)
     Oh, my, I don't know... everything?

               BETH
     Everything.
          (hesitating)
     Except the t.v.

Mrs. Dotson searches Beth's face with a kind gaze. Beth smiles 
nervously.

               BETH
          (apologetically)
     The t.v.s not for sale.

INT/EXT. NICK'S SEDAN

Nick's smoking, looking haggard. Between drags, he anxiously 
taps a tempo on the steering wheel with his cigarette holding 
hand.

NICK'S POV

The highway and the desert stretch out before him, the heat 
waves of late afternoon shimmering above the blacktop.

In the distance, the giant teepee souvenir shop rises out of 
the horizon like a mirage.

NICK

An idea strikes him and his lips tighten into a small 
determined smile.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. TEEPEE GIFT SHOP - AFTERNOON

A couple of vacationing families and a busload of elderly 
sightseers poke through the stunning assortment of Native 
American souvenirs.

Nick stands at the counter talking to a plump elderly NAVAJO 
WOMAN.

               NAVAJO WOMAN
     Maybe some nice turquoise jewelry.

               NICK
          (shaking his head)
     I don't think she really wears 
     jewelry.

A little boy stares at the disheveled Nick. His mother hurries 
him away.

               NAVAJO WOMAN
     Maybe a nice Navajo rug?

               NICK
          (incredulous)
     As a present? No.

He points past her.

               NICK
     What about that?

THEIR POV

A huge beautifully feathered ceremonial headdress.

NICK AND THE NAVAJO WOMAN

               NICK
     That would make her laugh.

               NAVAJO WOMAN
          (not amused)
     That's authentic -- it's very 
     expensive.

               NICK
     You got something like it but fake?

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. FRONT LAWN - LATE AFTERNOON

Beth and Mrs. Dotson are standing beside the now empty 
blankets.

In the BACKGROUND, Sid and Carol are packing boxes into Mrs. 
Dotson's car.

Mrs. Dotson has begun to fill out a check.

               MRS. DOTSON
     I'm sorry, what's your name?

               BETH
     Can you just leave the name blank? I 
     won't have an account, so I'll have 
     to find someplace to cash it for me.

Mrs. Dotson looks at her. They stare into each other's eyes.

               MRS. DOTSON
          (after a beat)
     All right.

Mrs. Dotson hands Beth the check. Beth sticks it in her back 
pocket. After an awkward moment she extends her hand.

               BETH
     Thanks a lot.

Mrs. Dotson takes her hand. Sid and Carol walk up to them.

               SID
          (cheerfully)
     You're set.

Mrs. Dotson lets go of Beth's hand. They turn to Sid and 
Carol.

               MRS. DOTSON
          (warmly chagrined)
     You did all the work...

               SID
          (good-naturedly)
     Sure.
          (mischieviously)
     Now I've gotta finish painting, but 
     Carol here would be happy to help 
     you unload.

Carol starts to protest and then checks herself for Beth's 
sake.

               CAROL
          (trapped, dryly)
     Of course. I'll follow you in my 
     car.

               SID
          (to Mrs. Dotson)
     And I'll be by tomorrow with my truck 
     and the big things.

He heads into the house. Beth stares after him. Mrs. Dotson 
touches her shoulder, lightly, getting her attention.

               MRS. DOTSON
          (to Beth)
     Thank you.
          (smiling)
     You've given me a home.

She looks to Carol.

               CAROL
          (nicely)
     I'll be right along.

Mrs. Dotson walks off toward her car.

               CAROL
          (to Beth)
     This had to be history's most 
     efficient tag sale.

Beth laughs, distractedly.

               BETH
     Yeah... I'm sorry Sid stuck you with 
     unloading.

               CAROL
     No problem.
          (smiling to herself)
     He kinda bites my butt, but he's 
     okay.

               BETH
     He is.

Beth suddenly embraces Carol.

               BETH
     Listen.
          (breaking the embrace)
     I'll probably be gone before you get 
     back.

               CAROL
     I thought maybe we could be roomies 
     for a while. You know, while you 
     figure out what's next.

               BETH
          (shaking her head)
     I can't.
          (after a beat, 
               admitting her feelings)
     He gets to me... too much. If I don't 
     go I'll end up with staying with 
     him.

               CAROL
          (gently)
     You've done worse.

               BETH
     Sure.

They look at each other and start to laugh. Their laughter 
builds -- a release of the strain of the last two days.

Nick's driving fast, completely focused on the road ahead, 
the wind ROARING through the open windows.

A cheap plastic Indian headdress with brightly colored 
synthetic feathers is perched on his head.

INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Sid's finished painting -- the room gleams. He pulls a 
dropcloth off the bureau, then another one off of Beth's two 
packed suitcases.

               BETH (O.S.)
          (softly)
     Sid?

Sid turns and looks, smiling.

SID'S POV

Beth is standing in the doorway, a weariness having settled 
over her. She steps into the room.

BETH AND SID

               SID
     Hi.

               BETH
     I'm sorry about selling the sofa 
     bed.

               SID
     I didn't really need one. When my 
     friends get drunk, they throw up and 
     sleep on the floor.

               BETH
     But I gave it to you.

He puts his arms around her.

               SID
     You gave me a lot more.

               BETH
     No.
          (holding him tightly)
     It was all even in this department.

               SID
          (softly)
     ...Feel me?

               BETH
          (whispering)
     I know... You're hard again.

Holding her tightly, Sid runs his fingers down her spine.

               SID
     I want you all the time.

               BETH
          (torn)
     Shit.

She kisses him. They kiss, long and hard. Abruptly, she breaks 
the embrace and moves away from him.

               BETH
          (ironically self-aware)
     I just fleeced a widow.

               SID
          (protesting)
     No...

               BETH
     It was all junk.

She shivers.

               BETH
     Shit. I've got to get some aspirin...
          (shaking her head)
     I didn't drink enough to be hung 
     over.

She walks away from Sid, out of the bedroom.

INT. BETH'S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Beth gulps down aspirin. She stares at herself in the mirror, 
wearily searching.

IN THE MIRROR

Sid appears in the doorway, his reflection small next to the 
reflection of her face.

               SID
     You just feel bad for her like I 
     feel bad for her... 'cause her husband 
     died.

               BETH
          (doubting this)
     Yeah?

ANGLE TO INCLUDE SID AND BETH

               SID
     That's about the saddest thing there 
     is... losing someone you love.

Beth is struck by a certainty that she's never lost anyone 
she's loved because she's never really loved anyone.

               BETH
     It's never happened to me.

Sid hesitates, then speaks his heart.

               SID
     If you died, I couldn't stand life.

               BETH
     I...

She steps forward and kisses him. She steps back.

               BETH
          (businesslike)
     I've got to go now.

She walks out of the bathroom. Sid and THE CAMERA FOLLOW as 
she hurries though the living room toward the bedroom.

IN THE LIVING ROOM

               BETH
     The new people'll be here.

She disappears down the hall to the bedroom.

               SID
          (following)
     Go to my house.

               BETH (O.S.)
     No.

IN THE BEDROOM

Beth picks up her suitcases. Sid steps into the doorway.

               SID
     While you find a place.

               BETH
     No. I gotta get out.

She heads to the bedroom door.

               SID
     I can talk to the realtors, I know 
     they've got a place in Agawam.

Beth stops.

               BETH
          (shaking her head)
     No... Agawam?... no. I don't know 
     where I'm going. Somewhere else.

She walks past him into the hallway. Sid and THE CAMERA 
FOLLOW.

               SID
     You can call me when you get there. 
     I'll give you my number.

IN THE LIVING ROOM

She stops and puts down the suitcases.

               BETH
          (gently)
     Sid. I'm going away. You're making 
     me way too important. You met me 
     yesterday.

He goes to her.

               SID
     And today I love you.

She steps back, shaking her head.

               BETH
     Jesus... one day...

               SID
     That doesn't matter. You know that. 
     It can take a second.

Beth loses control, upset with herself for having mixed 
emotions, upset with her life, and upset he's making this 
more difficult.

               BETH
     No! That's... that's a fuckin' animal 
     thing, I've done that.

               SID
     Not with me.

               BETH
     I meet men, go home with them and 
     just stay. No decision involved -- 
     it's just what I do. And then I don't 
     have to live my life, I just lead 
     theirs. I can't keep doing that.

               SID
          (adamant)
     We're not that way!

               BETH
     What way are we?

               SID
     We're passionate. We're comfortable.

               BETH
     It's been passionate, it's been 
     comfortable. But it hasn't been... 
     important.
          (after a beat)
     Like you're making it!

               SID
          (urgently)
     It is important! You know that.

               BETH
     No! It was a night! It wasn't real. 
     It was fun, it was some great fucking! 
     But it's just something that happened! 
     It's not real!

               SID
     It didn't "just happen"! You know 
     we're it! I'm the one for you!

               BETH
     The "one"?! I've had lots of "ones"! 
     I look like a baby but I'm twenty-
     fuckin'-- eight years old! You're 
     just the latest!

               SID
     No. I'm the last. You've found me. 
     And it can go on forever.

               BETH
     No!
          (her heart breaking 
               for him)
     Oh, Sid... Forever?
          (shaking her head)
     You have to understand -- it's just 
     talk.

               SID
     It's not.

               BETH
          (defiantly disbelieving)
     It is. C'mon, these things you say... 
     c'mon! What?! If I died you couldn't 
     stand life? That's... that's...

               SID
     That's true.

               BETH
     No.

Beth can't bear the risk of opening her soul to believe him -- 
and she can't bear to hear the outpouring of his soul without 
believing him. So she ends it.

               BETH
          (after a beat, harshly)
     You won't know when I die. You won't 
     be there.

She picks up her suitcases and heads for the door.

               SID
          (following her, certain)
     You'd want me there. If I wasn't 
     there it wouldn't matter who was. 
     You'd be alone.

               BETH
     No.

He grabs her arms and spins her to face him.

               SID
          (imploring)
     Beth... Beth... you love me...

               BETH
          (defiantly)
     No!

               SID
     How do you feel? Think! You love me.

She stares at him, breathing deeply, gathering herself. He 
lets go of her arms and steps back.

               BETH
          (her words carefully 
               chosen)
     I care about you.

               SID
     You have to be with me.

               BETH
     No.
          (pause)
     I care about you. But I'm an adult. 
     I can say no.

They stare at each other.

               SID
          (w/ controlled anger)
     That's what makes you an adult?

               BETH
          (unwavering)
     Yes.
          (pause)
     I can say no.
          (pause)
     No, I won't do that. No, I won't 
     have that. No, I can't.

               SID
          (needing to hear her 
               say it)
     You can say no to me?

               BETH
     Yes.

He looks away from her. She stares at his back.

               BETH
     I'm going.

She steps toward the door.

               SID
     Beth!

She stops.

               SID
          (after a beat)
     Have someplace to go.

               BETH
          (simply)
     I don't.

She opens the door.

               SID
     Why don't...

               BETH
          (interrupting)
     Don't tell me what to do.

She goes out the door. Sid goes to the door.

EXT. THE FRONT LAWN - CONTINUOUS

Beth makes her way to her car. Sid stands in the doorway, 
watching.

               SID
     What are you gonna do?

She turns and faces him.

               BETH
     I don't know.

Beth tosses her suitcases in the backseat. She gets into the 
car and starts the engine.

Sid stands, willing her to stop the car.

Beth pulls out to the end of the driveway.

INT. BETH'S PINTO

She looks up at the rearview mirror.

BETH'S POV

Sid is framed in the doorway of her old home, waiting, 
trusting that she can't leave, that they are destined.

BETH

Her eyes well with tears. Her face sets with resolve.

THE HOUSE AND DRIVEWAY

The car pulls out and disappears down the road. Sid stands 
in the doorway for a long moment. He steps back into the 
house and shuts the door.

                                        SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

INT. NICK'S CAR - DUSK

Nick is driving, the cheap headdress still perched on his 
head. Crumpled empty coffee cups are scattered about the 
front seat. He reaches up and turns the rearview mirror.

REARVIEW MIRROR

Nick's face stares back at him. It's not a pretty sight.

NICK

Nick reaches into the back seat, fishes and comes up with 
his necktie. He slips the still-knotted necktie over his 
headdress and tightens it around his neck.

Nick looks back to the road and suddenly swerves off an exit 
ramp. The CAMERA LINGERS on the Exit Sign -- "Enfield AZ.".

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. KITCHEN - DUSK

Sid silently goes through the motions of pulling the masking 
tape from around the window sills of the freshly painted 
room, his face a stony mask.

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. BETH'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Nick's car screeches to a stop in front of the house. He 
leaps out of the car and runs toward the front door.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The front door flings open. Nick charges into the room.

               NICK
          (calling out)
     Beth!
          (bellowing)
     Beth!!!

Sid steps through the swinging door into the living room. 
Nick freezes.

               SID
          (coldly)
     She's not here.

               NICK
          (desperately)
     Where is she?

               SID
     She's gone.

               NICK
     Shit!
          (a moment of manners)
     Excuse me.
          (exploding)
     Shiiiiit!!
          (confrontationally)
     Who are you?

               SID
          (coldly)
     The painter. You're Nick.

               NICK
          (startled)
     Yeah.

               SID
     The Indian chief.

               NICK
          (puzzled)
     What?

Then Nick, remembering the headdress, rips it off his head 
and furiously tears it apart -- scattering a flurry of plastic 
feathers. He hurls what's left of it across the room.

               NICK
     Shit!

               SID
          (accusingly)
     You're too late. She's gone.

               NICK
          (angrily)
     I got that. Where'd she go?

               SID
     She didn't say.

               NICK
     Shit!

               SID
          (bitterly)
     She didn't know.

Nick runs out the front door.

EXT. NICK'S FRONT LAWN - CONTINUOUS

Nick runs out into his lawn.

               NICK
          (running; under his 
               breath)
     Be at Carol's... be at Carol's...

The CAMERA FOLLOWING he races up to Carol's front door and 
leans on the doorbell -- a loud tight buzzing.

He pounds on the door, then stops, gasping for breath. No 
one's home. He turns, leaning against the door for support, 
staring out at tract house neighborhood.

               NICK
          (spent)
     I'm too late...

Suddenly he bolts for his car.

Nick yanks his car door open and disappears into it. In a 
second he emerges with the bottle of scotch.

It's empty. He eyes it for a moment then hurls it as far as 
he can down the street -- it shatters explosively.

He races to his front door and stops dead in his tracks at 
the open doorway.

INT. NICK'S LIVING ROOM

Sid has covered the floor and remaining furniture with drop 
cloths and is applying even strokes to the ceiling with a 
long handled roller.

Nick steps in and stares at Sid and his own nearly empty 
drop-cloth covered home.

               NICK
          (at the top of his 
               lungs)
     This really bothers me!

Sid stares at him.

               SID
          (after a moment, with 
               mock politeness)
     Will you do me a favor?

               NICK
          (spitting out the 
               word)
     What?

               SID
     Act normal.

Nick advances on Sid.

               NICK
          (adamantly)
     Listen! I don't want to be normal. I 
     don't have to be, I don't! This is 
     my house. You're in my house. And 
     I'm tired of going to my house and 
     finding strangers!

They're face to face in a stand-off.

               SID
     It's not your house. You're gone. 
     I'm painting --

He puts the long handled roller right in Nick's face.

               SID
     -- for the new people -- whose house 
     it's going to be.
          (pause)
     You're gone. They're not here yet. 
     I'm here.
          (calmly)
     I guess that makes this my house.

Nick ponders this logic, Sid's size, and the roller in his 
face.

               NICK
          (politely)
     May I look around?

               SID
          (w/ a stony politeness)
     Sure. Make yourself at home.

Nick wanders around the nearly empty room, then, after a 
beat...

...he pulls a dropcloth off an object in the corner, revealing 
the television.

               NICK
          (dismayed)
     Nooo... she left the television.

               SID
     Yeah.

               NICK
     Too bad.

               SID
          (pointedly)
     She didn't seem to want it.

               NICK
     That's foolish. That t.v. is a 
     remarkable thing.

They both stare at the television.

The sweep of HEADLIGHTS turning into the driveway cross their 
faces. They both race to the door.

EXT. FRONT LAWN - CONTINUOUS

Carol gets out of her car. Nick hurries toward her.

               CAROL
          (flatly)
     You came back.

               NICK
          (a little chagrined)
     Yeah.

               CAROL
     Is Beth here?

               NICK
     No. Do you know where she went?

               CAROL
     No.

               NICK
     Shit.

               CAROL
     You're too late.

               SID
          (from the doorway)
     She's gone.

               NICK
          (to Carol, exasperated)
     Who is this guy?

               CAROL
          (walking past him 
               toward the house)
     Beth's new boyfriend.

               NICK
          (exploding)
     What?!

               CAROL
          (stopping)
     You heard me.

               NICK
          (to Sid)
     Is this true?!

               SID
     Not really.

He turns and walks back into the house.

               NICK
          (to Carol)
     Not really?

He races after Sid.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Sid is painting the ceiling. Nick bursts through the door.

               NICK
          (to Sid)
     Not really?! What?
          (w/ "say it ain't so" 
               attitude)
     Did you fuck her?

               SID
     I don't tell.

               NICK
     Jesus! The next day!
          (bitterly disillusioned)
     That's the world, huh? They don't 
     even wait a day anymore.

               CAROL
          (stepping in the 
               doorway)
     You left her.

               NICK
          (defensively)
     I didn't fuck anyone.

               CAROL
          (witheringly)
     You didn't find anyone.

               NICK
          (hurt)
     No... I didn't leave her for another 
     person, I left her for another place.
          (pause)
     Which I think is a little more 
     excusable.

               SID
     I don't.

               NICK
     Well it's none of your fuckin' 
     business!

               SID
          (threateningly)
     I think it is.

               NICK
     Cause you fucked her? No! That gives 
     you no business in my life.

               SID
     If you hadn't gone, I'd be done by 
     now. I'd be home.

               NICK
     Be glad you have a home, asshole!

               CAROL
     Let it drop, Nick!

               NICK
          (outraged)
     Why?!

               CAROL
     He was nice to Beth when you treated 
     her like shit.

Nick stares at her -- knowing what she says is true.

               NICK
          (protesting weakly)
     I came back...

               CAROL
          (busting him)
     Nick. This is me. You didn't come 
     back for Beth's sake -- something 
     just didn't work out like you had 
     planned.

               NICK
          (defensively)
     You see -- you don't know everything 
     about me -- I didn't really have any 
     real plans!

               CAROL
     He was sweet to her. They were sweet 
     with each other.

Nick stares at her.

               CAROL
     Beth looked young with him. They had 
     a real connection.

               NICK
          (after a beat, dryly)
     And I brought them together?

He exhales loudly and holds his head in his hands.

               NICK
     It seems I'm blessed... in what I 
     do. I do wrong, and it turns out 
     right... that I've done right. So it 
     really doesn't matter what I do.

Nick takes a deep breath.

               NICK
     Hey!

Sid ignores him.

               NICK
          (after a beat)
     I said "hey!"

Sid looks at him.

               NICK
          (flamboyantly sarcastic)
     I hope you're very happy together!

               SID
     She's gone.

               NICK
          (glancing to Carol, 
               pointedly)
     She is, isn't she?
          (to Sid)
     If you two were such the happy couple 
     why the fuck did she leave, Romeo?

               SID
     After three years with you, she wanted 
     to be alone.

               NICK
     I was already gone! This is not about 
     me and Beth, there is no me and Beth! 
     This is about you! Why didn't you go 
     with her?

               SID
     It wasn't offered.

               NICK
          (advancing on him)
     People aren't going to offer you 
     anything! You have to take what you 
     want.

               SID
     You can't take another person. They 
     have to give themselves to you.

               NICK
          (in his face)
     That's very wise, but not very true.
          (relentlessly)
     I sell televisions. People don't 
     know what they want. You have to 
     show them.

               SID
     I couldn't show her.

               NICK
     Go after her!

               CAROL
     Leave him alone!

               NICK
     No. He's not alone, he's with us. 
     She's alone. She's out there alone.
          (after a beat, quietly)
     Just hoping she's closer to what she 
     wants...

               CAROL
          (sardonically)
     And what is that?

               NICK
          (exploding)
     I don't know!

Nick throws his arms in the air and storms up to Carol's 
face.

               NICK
     How would I know?! What do I know?!

Carol doesn't flinch. He steps back.

               NICK
          (w/ a sweeping gesture)
     I know that what I want isn't there.
          (pointing to his chest)
     It isn't here.
          (gesturing wildly)
     It isn't inside! It isn't outside!
          (spent)
     It doesn't exist.

He turns on Sid.

               NICK
          (forcefully)
     But you want her, and you aren't 
     doing shit about it!

               CAROL
     There isn't anything he can do.

               NICK
     He can go after her.
          (to Sid)
     Go after her!

               SID
     I can't. She...
          (torn)
     My life is here.

               NICK
     What kind of man won't fuck up his 
     life for the women he loves? Go find 
     her!!

He stares at Sid.

               CAROL
     He wouldn't know where to look.

               NICK
          (groping)
     She'd she'd she'd...
          (triumphant)
     She'd head for her parents!

               CAROL
     What?

               NICK
     She'd head for her parents. Believe 
     me.
          (pause, then flatly)
     They're in Florida. That's east.

Nick stares at Sid, waiting.

               SID
     I...

               NICK
          (businesslike)
     You start driving east on route forty. 
     Keep going east and around eleven 
     start checking every roadside motel. 
     The budget ones... You do that all 
     night, you'll find her.

               CAROL
     How do you know she's on the highway?

               NICK
     When you don't know where you're 
     going, you drive on the highway.

Sid looks to Carol, then around the drop cloth covered room.

               NICK
          (cheerfully)
     I'll finish painting.

               SID
          (to Carol)
     Do I have a chance?

Nick and Sid both look to Carol.

               CAROL
          (after a beat, shaking 
               her head)
     You've got a chance.

               SID
          (determined)
     Then I'm gone.

Sid races out the door.

Nick tosses a self-satisfied smile at Carol and walks past 
her to the door.

SOUND

Sid's truck engine roars to life.

NICK'S POV

Sid peels out, driving up onto the lawn past Nick and Carol's 
cars, out onto the street and out of sight.

THE DOORWAY

Carol steps into the doorway beside Nick.

               CAROL
     So.
          (dryly)
     Start painting.

Nick looks back into the room.

               NICK
          (after a beat)
     Fuck the ceiling.
          (walking in)
     Who looks up that often?

Carol follows him into the room. Nick slumps on the sofa, 
staring at the blank t.v.

               MAN'S VOICE
          (happily)
     This is it!

A MAN and a WOMAN, both slightly portly Mexican-Americans in 
their late forties, wearing their Sunday best, step over the 
threshold and kiss.

The man is carrying the woman cradled in his arms.

               CAROL
          (politely)
     Hello...?

               MAN
          (surprised, breaking 
               the kiss)
     Oh. Hello.

The four stare at each other in awkward silence, the woman 
still cradled in the man's arms.

               MAN
     I'm sorry. We thought it was going 
     to be empty.

               NICK
          (flatly)
     It is.

               WOMAN
          (cheerfully)
     We're here to move in.

The man puts her down on her feet.

               WOMAN
     Are you the couple moving out?

               CAROL
     No.

               NICK
     No...

Nick and Carol look to each other, at a loss. Nick looks 
back to the couple.

               NICK
          (improvising)
     We're your new neighbors. From next 
     door.

Carol throws him a look.

               MAN
     Well.
          (putting on a good 
               face)
     It's nice to meet you.

He holds out his hand to shake. After an instant of awkward 
hesitation they all shake hands with too much enthusiasm.

               WOMAN
          (cheerfully, while 
               shaking hands)
     It is... and it's so nice of you to 
     greet us.

               CAROL
     Thank you.

They finish the handshakes -- there's an awkward pause.

               NICK
     Actually, we're here for the t.v.

He waits, half expecting this statement to be challenged. It 
isn't.

               NICK
          (confidently)
     The people who left here -- our old 
     neighbors -- left us that t.v.

They all look at the t.v.

               MAN
     Oh. It's very nice.

               CAROL
     Yes. It is.

There's an awkward pause.

               CAROL
          (going to the t.v.)
     Well, dear... we should carry it 
     home.

Nick and Carol lift the t.v.

               WOMAN
     Do you need help?

               NICK
     We can manage.

They move toward the front door, Carol going backwards.

               CAROL
     Thanks anyway.

Nick looks to make eye contact with Carol. He can't. She's 
looking back over her shoulder for obstacles. He smiles and 
glances toward the couple.

Nick and Carol go out the door, lugging the t.v.

               WOMAN
          (calling out)
     Nice meeting you.

The man and woman look at each other. They look around the 
room.

               MAN
     They're not done painting.

               WOMAN
     They'll finish.

She stares out the front door.

               WOMAN
          (whimsically)
     I wonder where our furniture is?

She looks back to him. He's staring at the ceiling.

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. THE LAWN - CONTINUOUS

They're lugging the t.v. across to Carol's -- Carol backing 
up and Nick going forward. They arrive at the front door.

Nick takes most of the weight of the t.v., while Carol fumbles 
with her key into her front door lock with her free hand.

               CAROL
     You're not going to be their new 
     neighbor.

               NICK
     It was just something to say.

Carol gets the door open.

               CAROL
     Good.

Carol backs into the house, leading the way.

INT. CAROL'S FOYER - CONTINUOUS

They lug the t.v. toward the living room.

               CAROL
     You look terrible.

               NICK
     Yeah? Well, I had a big day.
          (after a beat)
     I went to my parent's house. Like 
     you said to. And there was this 
     ancient man, this giant man in the 
     doorway.

They step into the living room.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Carol leads them to a corner.

               NICK
     And I thought, "It's my father. My 
     how he's aged."

               CAROL
     You were drunk...

They gingerly put the t.v. down.

               NICK
     Not at the house. At the house I was 
     stone sober.

Nick slumps down onto the sofa. Carol watches him, puzzled.

               NICK
     He was very tall. He was too tall to 
     be my father. He was wearing a long 
     overcoat, and I thought, "it's a 
     trick, he's on my mother's shoulders".

He smiles at the memory.

               NICK
     And then out from behind him came 
     this beautiful young girl... Beth.

               CAROL
     Beth?...

               NICK
          (lost in reverie)
     And they sang to me. They sang "London 
     Bridge is Falling Down"...
          (singing softly)
     "Falling down, falling down.".

Nick looks to Carol. She stares at him.

               NICK
          (seriously)
     It was very touching.

               CAROL
     I'm sure.

               NICK
          (defensively)
     It was.

Carol sits beside him.

               CAROL
     Nick?...

               NICK
     Yeah?

               CAROL
     What you've been doing... you can't 
     do anymore.

Nick looks to Carol, puzzled.

               CAROL
     You just can't do it.

               NICK
          (after a beat, 
               agreeably)
     Okay.

               CAROL
          (very skeptically)
     Okay?

               NICK
     Yeah. I understand.

               CAROL
     No. I don't think so.

               NICK
          (defensively)
     I understand.

               CAROL
          (determined)
     It's not like you can't do it.

               NICK
          (interjecting)
     I'll stop.

               CAROL
          (urgently)
     It's that I don't want you to do it.

               NICK
     I've stopped.

She stares at Nick. He avoids her stare. She takes his face 
in her hand and makes him look at her.

               CAROL
          (staring in his eyes)
     Nick.
          (emphatic)
     I don't want you to do it.

Nick stares in her eyes.

               NICK
          (calmly, after a beat)
     Okay.

She lets go of his face.

               CAROL
     Shit.
          (after a beat, wryly)
     I hate talking to you.

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. SID'S TRUCK - NIGHT

Through the windshield we see Sid driving slowly, looking 
out at motel parking lots. Their neon signs reflect in the 
windshield.

EXT. STRIP OFF THE HIGHWAY

Gas stations, fast food joints and motels.

Sid and his truck pull away from the strip and up onto the 
on ramp.

EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

Sid and his truck pull onto the highway.

CREDITS ROLL

As Sid's taillights disappear down the barren highway.

                                   FADE OUT:

               THE END
