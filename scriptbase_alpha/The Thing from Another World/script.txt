               FADE IN:

               EXT. NIGHT

               The snow piled streets at Dutch Harbor, Alaska. A wind blows. 
               The street is empty. A bundled figure moves through the street 
               toward a low roofed lighted building.

               A sign outside the building reads:

                          "OFFICER'S CLUB, DUTCH HARBOR, ALASKA"

               Someone has scribbled the words under the printing "No 
               Penguins allowed".

               The figure stops in the doorway and looks at a long 
               thermometer. It registers twenty-five below zero. The figure 
               continues into the club.

               INT. OFFICERS CLUB ROOM - MIDNIGHT

               This is the social center for U.S.A. flying men roosting in 
               the polar regions. The air base is near Dutch Harbor, Alaska -- 
               a commuting hop from the Arctic Circle. It is early winter. 
               The night in Dutch Harbor is long and dark.

               In the room two of the six gaming tables are occupied. At 
               one sits a four handed bridge game. At the other sit five 
               men playing poker. RADIO MUSIC -- an American Service 
               Broadcast -- is coming a bit feebly into the room. All is 
               cozy and steam-heated in the room.

               Among the five poker players are three men who are to be 
               active in our story. One is W.O. Vic MacAuliff. He is a tough, 
               taciturn radio man. He has seen service everywhere, heard 
               nearly all the languages and drunk nearly all the different 
               brews of the earth.

               The second is Captain Pat Henry, in his early thirties.  
               Captain Henry has been a flyer since he shed his first 
               stocking cap. He is a man of whimsey and temper and also 
               mood.

               The third is Lieutenant Eddie Dykes, a tall, homely man under 
               thirty.

               The overcoats, boots, ear-lapped military hats of the aviators 
               lie on an unused table nearby.

                                     EDDIE DYKES
                              (as he shuffles and 
                              deals)
                         It was about a hundred and five in 
                         the shade in this place. The women 
                         didn't wear any clothes at all to 
                         speak of -- which was very intelligent 
                         of them. You lay in a hammock and 
                         three of them stood there fanning 
                         you. When I die, I hope to go to 
                         Accra.

                                     MACAULIFF
                         I was there.

                                     HENRY
                              (looking at his hand)
                         I open for one dollar.

                                     PLAYER
                         I stay.

                                     PLAYER
                         I'm out.

                                     MACAULIFF
                         Going up.

               He puts two chips on the table.

                                     EDDIE
                         Scotland strikes again. I'm in. Cards, 
                         gentlemen.

               Two other players add another chip each to the pot.

                                     HENRY
                         Three.

                                     PLAYERS
                         Three.

                                     MACAULIFF
                         These'll do.

               The figure has entered the room and is surveying the poker 
               players as it removes its wrappings. He is Ned Skeely, a 
               newspaper correspondent.

                                     HENRY
                         Hello, Skeely, how are you?

                                     SKEELY
                         Faintly alive. Twenty-five below and 
                         going down. It's a night for brass 
                         monkeys.

                                     HENRY
                         Care to join us?

                                     SKEELY
                         As soon as I count my fingers. I may 
                         have lost some.

                                     HENRY
                         I think you know everybody here.

               Players smile and say "sure."

                                     MACAULIFF
                         I haven't met the gentleman, Captain.

                                     HENRY
                         Ned Skeely -- Angus MacAuliff.

                                     MACAULIFF
                         How do you do, sir.

                                     EDDIE
                         Mr. Skeely's a newspaper man, Mca. 
                         We're going to put on a snow ball 
                         fight for him tomorrow.

               Skeely takes a seat next to Eddie.

                                     HENRY
                              (returning to the 
                              play)
                         One dollar is bet.

                                     EDDIE
                         Against a pat hand held by a 
                         Scotchman. Captain Henry, your 
                         decorations for valor have gone to 
                         your head. I'm folding.

                                     MACAULIFF
                         Call.

                                     HENRY
                         A pair of aces.

                                     MACAULIFF
                         Beats two queens.

                                     EDDIE
                              (to MacAuliff)
                         You ought to know better than to try 
                         fooling my pal. Only dames can do 
                         that.

                                     HENRY
                              (quietly)
                         I promised you a kick in the belly.

                                     EDDIE
                              (mockingly)
                         Forgive. Forgive. A slip of the 
                         tongue.

                                     HENRY
                              (to Skeely)
                         How'd you make out with General 
                         Fogarty?

                                     SKEELY
                         Your general is nursing his secrets 
                         like a June bride.

                                     MACAULIFF
                         Deal 'em out, lieutenant.

                                     EDDIE
                         You in, Mr. Skeely?

                                     SKEELY
                         Yes. I am always interested in 
                         pauperizing the air force.

                                     EDDIE
                              (dealing)
                         I've got a big idea that involves 
                         you, Mr. Skeely. You're not going to 
                         get any story out of this post. 
                         Forgarty has given us all instructions 
                         to treat you like a Russian spy.

                                     SKEELY
                         General Fogarty is going to end up 
                         on his knees begging for my attention.

                                     EDDIE
                              (intently)
                         This is more practical, Mr. Skeely. 
                         There's a man in Edmonton who can 
                         give you the whole Radar defense 
                         story. Loves to talk. General 
                         MacLaren. You tell the General you 
                         want to get to Edmonton -- and Pat 
                         and I'll fly you there.

                                     SKEELY
                         I know General MacLaren. He bores 
                         me.

                                     EDDIE
                              (desperately)
                         Don't be like that! It's warm in 
                         Edmonton! They've got girls in 
                         Edmonton! Without fur pants on!

                                     SKEELY
                              (to Henry)
                         How about it, Captain?

                                     HENRY
                         Let's play cards.

                                     MACAULIFF
                              (to Eddie)
                         Ye ought to know better than to try 
                         and shoo our captain southward -- 
                         with his heart wrapped around the 
                         North Pole.

                                     HENRY
                         That'll do, Mr. MacAuliff.

                                     MACAULIFF
                              (grinning)
                         I open -- for two dollars.

                                     SKEELY
                              (casually, as they 
                              play)
                         What's going on at the North Pole?

                                     EDDIE
                         Some scientists are holding a 
                         convention there. Looking for Polar 
                         bear tails. Ever hear of Dr. 
                         Carrington?

                                     SKEELY
                         The fellow who was at Bikini?

                                     EDDIE
                         The same.

                                     HENRY
                         They're holed in about two thousand 
                         miles north of here, a lot of 
                         botanists and physicists.

                                     EDDIE
                              (solemnly)
                         Including a pin-up girl. Very 
                         interesting type. Captain Henry can 
                         give you any data on her you want.

                                     HENRY
                              (looking at his cards 
                              and speaking quietly 
                              to Eddie)
                         Someday I hope to have a co-pilot a 
                         cut above a high school boy -- or at 
                         least dry behind his ears --

               A voice comes over the P.A. speaker.

                                     VOICE
                         Captain Henry. Captain Pat Henry. 
                         Report to General Fogarty's quarters 
                         at once, please.

               Henry rises from the table.

                                     SKEELY
                              (frowning and serious)
                         Twelve thirty and a general yelling 
                         for his troops. Sounds like the old 
                         days.

               Henry starts putting on his overcoat.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. GENERAL FOGARTY'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

               A living room with a fire going in the fire place. The room 
               is fairly well furnished. Some war trophies are on the wall, 
               including a piece of a Japanese aeroplane, a Jap sword, and 
               other important war souvenirs.

               Three men are in the room. One is General Fogarty, in his 
               forties; the second is the adjutant of the post, Major Smith. 
               The third is Corporal Hauser from the post's communication 
               center.

                                     FOGARTY
                              (to Corporal Hauser)
                         If any more messages come in from 
                         that base I want to be notified 
                         personally, no matter what time.  
                         Tell the O.D.

                                     CORPORAL
                         Yes, sir.

               There is a knock on the door.

                                     FOGARTY
                         Come in.

               The door opens and a blast of freezing air hits the room as 
               Captain Henry enters. He closes the door.

                                     HENRY
                         Good evening, sir.

               Corporal Hauser opens the door and exits, letting another 
               blast of cold into the room. The General shivers, scowls and 
               grumbles.

                                     FOGARTY
                              (shivering)
                         Freddie, any chance of the Pentagon 
                         sending us a revolving door?

                                     MAJOR
                         Could be. We got a gross of pith 
                         helmets last week.

                                     FOGARTY
                              (to Henry)
                         I've go something queer here from 
                         your picnic party up north. Just 
                         came in.
                              (he reads from a paper)
                         Believe air ship unusual type crashed 
                         in our vicinity. Please send 
                         facilities to investigate. Most 
                         urgent.
                              (he looks up)
                         It's from Dr. Carrington. What's it 
                         sound like to you, Pat?

                                     HENRY
                         I think I'd better hop up.

                                     FOGARTY
                              (dryly)
                         I knew you'd say that. But what do 
                         you think you'll find, besides your 
                         lady friend?

                                     HENRY
                              (quietly)
                         I don't know. Any of our ships 
                         reported missing?

                                     MAJOR
                         Not a one.

                                     HENRY
                         Could be a Russky. They're all over 
                         the Pole, like flies.

                                     FOGARTY
                              (smiling)
                         Don't get nervous. You're going. 
                         When a double dome like Professor 
                         Carrington says "most urgent", small 
                         people like us have to jump. Better 
                         take a dog team and everything you 
                         might need for rescue work.

                                     HENRY
                         I'll take off at 4:30.

                                     MAJOR
                         What's the weather, Pat?

                                     HENRY
                         There's a bad front moving in. But I 
                         think there's enough time to get 
                         there and back without bumping into 
                         it.

                                     FOGARTY
                         You can do me a favor, Pat.

                                     HENRY
                         Yes, sir.

                                     FOGARTY
                         Take that newspaper fella up with 
                         you -- and maroon him there.

                                     HENRY
                         I'll invite him.

                                     FOGARTY
                         And don't get me wrong about who 
                         gets marooned, Captain Henry. I would 
                         appreciate it if you didn't smash a 
                         landing ski and find it necessary to 
                         twiddle your thumbs for a week while 
                         it's being repaired.

                                     HENRY
                              (coldly)
                         That accident was unavoidable, sir.

                                     FOGARTY
                         So was Romeo and Juliet. I'll expect 
                         you back tomorrow night -- with or 
                         without Mr. Skeely. Good luck.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. C-54 PLANE

               It is flying through a dimly lit sky. Below are cloud banks. 

               In the plane are W. O. MacAuliff, Ned Skeely, Navigator 
               Lieutenant Ken Ericson and Light Engineer Corporal Barnes. 
               Captain Henry is flying the ship, Lieut. Dykes is beside 
               him. MacAuliff is at his radio instrument.

               A dozen huskies and several sleds are in the plane, plus a 
               pile of other cargo tied down under tarpaulin.

                                     SKEELY
                         How far are we from camp?

                                     HENRY
                         Three hours. We've slowed down. 
                         There's a breeze blowing.

                                     EDDIE DYKES
                              (grimly)
                         A breeze, he says. It's hitting forty 
                         miles. But you'll find that our 
                         captain has some funny ideas about 
                         the North Pole. He thinks it's a 
                         garden spot. Come and bring the 
                         kiddies.

                                     HENRY
                              (grimly)
                         Your yapping is out of order, Eddie. 
                         I'm not going to tell you again --

                                     EDDIE
                         Always squawking -- that's me! And 
                         for no reason! Shackleton went to 
                         the North pole once -- and retired 
                         with a bag full of medals. I get to 
                         go there every three weeks --- like 
                         it was lover's lane.

                                     HENRY
                              (coldly)
                         I'd like you to get this straight, 
                         Mr. Skeely, if you write anything. 
                         I'm liaison officer between our post 
                         and the Carrington outfit. These 
                         flights are strictly official. Usually 
                         bring in supplies. They're charting 
                         magnetic currents, growing new kinds 
                         of polar plants, looking for minerals.

                                     EDDIE
                         That's right, Skeely. I was only 
                         kidding. It's a terrific outfit. The 
                         biggest collection of double domes 
                         ever got together on an ice cake.

                                     MACAULIFF
                              (to the talkers)
                         Something's coming through.

               Henry, Eddie and Navigator Ericson put on their head phones 
               and listen.

                                     EDDIE
                              (listening to the ear 
                              phones)
                         Somebody's gooped up!

                                     HENRY
                              (removing ear phones)
                         Give me a new reading, Ken.

                                     KEN
                         I can't understand it.

                                     SKEELY
                         Who was that?

                                     HENRY
                         The radio man, Hendrix -- talking 
                         for Carrington. He wants us to correct 
                         our compass reading twelve points 
                         East. A magnetic disturbance is 
                         whacking away at everything.

                                     KEN
                              (working)
                         This is no place to make a mistake, 
                         Pat. We were bee-lining for the place. 
                         Hadn't we better get them back.

                                     HENRY
                         No. Carrington doesn't make mistakes. 
                         We'll follow ground instructions.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. PLANE

               A view far below of the sprawling polar settlement.

               Small dots of roofs on a flat expanse of snow. The plane 
               starts descending.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. POLAR PROJECT CAMP - DAY

               The C-54 makes a landing on skis some two hundred feet from 
               the largest of the low looming buildings. The arrivals drop 
               out of the plane door.

               A half dozen Eskimo workers belonging to the camp hurry toward 
               them.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. LARGE ASSEMBLY ROOM OF POLAR EXPEDITION

               It is 60 per cent underground. It's windows are near the 
               ceiling and function as transoms for light.

               The room is comfortably furnished and warm. It's steam pipes 
               run along the wall.

               In the room are Dr. Chapman, Dr. Algari and Mrs. Chapman.

               Chapman is a forceful looking man in his forties. His wife 
               is a good looking woman of forty who is also his assistant. 
               Chapman is a minerologist. Algari is an elderly man, white 
               haired. He is a botanist.

               A male cook stands at a large electric stove. He is cooking 
               coffee and a hot lunch in a number of pots. Chapman walks up 
               the stairs to the door, which is near the top of the room.  
               He opens it.

               Captain Henry and his group come down the stairs.

                                     CHAPMAN
                         Very pretty landing, Captain. We 
                         watched it. How was the trip?

                                     HENRY
                         Nice ride. This is Mr. Skeely, Dr. 
                         Chapman, Mrs. Chapman, Dr. Algari. 
                         Mr. Skeely's a newspaperman.

                                     SKEELY
                         Glad to know you.

                                     CHAPMAN
                              (smiling)
                         Glad to have a newspaperman drop in 
                         on us. We're a bit off the beaten 
                         track.

                                     SKEELY
                              (looking around)
                         Don't tell me I'm practically at the 
                         North Pole! Looks more like my old 
                         Kentucky home.

                                     HENRY
                         Any further information, Dr. Chapman?

                                     CHAPMAN
                         I'm convinced it's some sort of 
                         Russian air craft. Probably some new 
                         jet propelled rocket.

                                     ALGARI
                         I very much doubt that, Hugo. I don't 
                         understand Russian science, but it 
                         can't be as far advanced as the 
                         indications we have from the crashed 
                         ship.

                                     CHAPMAN
                         If it is a ship. We're all quite 
                         excited, Captain.

                                     HENRY
                         Where's Dr. Carrington?

                                     CHAPMAN
                         In the lab.

                                     MRS. CHAPMAN
                         They'll all be here for lunch. It's 
                         ready -- if you'd like to eat first. 
                         Fresh vegetables.

                                     HENRY
                              (to Skeely)
                         From their own garden.

                                     SKEELY
                         Garden?

                                     MRS. CHAPMAN
                              (smiling)
                         Hothouse.

                                     SKEELY
                         You have a hothouse! At the Pole!

                                     EDDIE
                              (winking at Skeely)
                         They've got everything here. Wait 
                         till you see.

                                     HENRY
                         I'll join you in a few minutes.

                                     ALGARI
                         I'll take you to the lab, Captain.

                                     HENRY
                         Thanks. I know the way.

               He starts out of the room.

                                     MRS. CHAPMAN
                         Please sit down, everybody.

               The group moves toward a long refectory table set with twenty 
               places. We follow Captain Henry out.

               INT. A CONNECTING UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR BETWEEN TWO OF THE 
               CAMP BUILDINGS

               Henry, enters it and walks toward a steep stairway. He climbs 
               it and knocks on a door. A voice calls.

                                     VOICE
                         Come in.

               He opens the door.

               INT. NIKKI'S OFFICE AND SLEEPING QUARTERS

               A small office-like room, lined with filing cabinets, holding 
               a desk, a typewriter stand, a voice recording machine, and a 
               couch that serves as a bed, is revealed. Sitting at the desk, 
               typing, is a vivid, young woman, Alberta Nicholson. She is 
               called Nikki. She stops typing and rises.

                                     NIKKI
                         Pat! Welcome to our igloo!

                                     HENRY
                              (smiling)
                         Hello, Nikki. You look like seven 
                         million dollars. How are you?

                                     NIKKI
                         Wonderful. Sit down.

                                     HENRY
                         I talk better standing.

               He steps up to her and embraces her ardently. She pulls out 
               of his embrace, calmly, and without alarm.

                                     NIKKI
                         Please.
                              (she straightens her 
                              hair)
                         I think Dr. Carrington is waiting 
                         for you.

                                     HENRY
                         Dr. Carrington will have to wait.  
                         I'm busy.

               He tries to embrace her again.

                                     NIKKI
                              (evading him)
                         No, you're not.

                                     HENRY
                              (frowning)
                         What's the matter?

                                     NIKKI
                         Now, don't act surprised. We've been 
                         all through this before. I don't 
                         like promiscuous love making. It's 
                         meaningless.

                                     HENRY
                         Who's promiscuous? We're alone, aren't 
                         we?

                                     NIKKI
                         Pat, last time you were here, I spent 
                         three days wrestling with a typical 
                         air corps wolf. It was like playing 
                         puss-in-the-corner with Bluebeard or 
                         somebody. You even invaded my bedroom, 
                         claiming you were looking for a lost 
                         pocketknife. Now, I'm fond of you, 
                         Pat, but this time, if you don't 
                         keep your hands to yourself, we're 
                         through.

                                     HENRY
                         You're fond of me, eh? Well, I'm 
                         fond of you, too. What are we waiting 
                         for?

                                     NIKKI
                         We're waiting until we get to know 
                         each other.

                                     HENRY
                              (grinning)
                         Now you're on my side. Come here. 
                         You'll get to know me.

                                     NIKKI
                              (pushing him away)
                         Not that way.

                                     HENRY
                         What other way is there?

                                     NIKKI
                              (desperately)
                         Didn't you ever hear the word 
                         "conversation"? Didn't you ever read 
                         a book, or see a movie -- or -- or 
                         think about anything?

                                     HENRY
                         Yeah. But you don't want to talk 
                         about what I'm thinking.

                                     NIKKI
                         No, I don't. If that's all you can 
                         think!

                                     HENRY
                         I got other thoughts.

                                     NIKKI
                         It would be an entrancing diversion 
                         to hear one.

                                     HENRY
                         Well, try this one. Dames are all 
                         alike.

                                     NIKKI
                         That's not a thought. It's a cliché. 
                         And a stupid cliché.

                                     HENRY
                         All dames want to get married. If 
                         you ask them to marry you, you're 
                         sincere. If you don't you're 
                         Bluebeard, and a wolf.

                                     NIKKI
                              (dangerously)
                         Are you saying I want you to ask me 
                         to marry you?

                                     HENRY
                         Never could figure them out. If you 
                         buy a dame one meal and try to kiss 
                         her, you're a wolf and a Bluebeard.  
                         But if the same fellow promises to 
                         buy her thirty thousand meals, then 
                         he's a prospective husband and he 
                         couldn't beat her off with a stick.

                                     NIKKI
                         Yes, and tell a fellow your garter 
                         belt is your own business, and he'll 
                         think of every mean, stinking thing 
                         in the world to say back to you!

                                     HENRY
                              (calmly)
                         That's the war of the sexes, I guess.

                                     NIKKI
                         Well, I hate war!

                                     HENRY
                         On the other hand, it's my business. 
                         I got a commission. Gimme a kiss, 
                         Nikki.

                                     NIKKI
                         I'm tired of you. Now, come on. Doctor 
                         Carrington's eager to see you.

                                     HENRY
                              (gloomily)
                         Okay. Lead on, Miss Nicholson. I 
                         guess I came to the wrong Pole.

               He follows her out.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               INT. DR. CARRINGTON'S LABORATORY

               This is a large chamer in a separate building. Here are 
               concentrated the instruments used by the various scientists 
               in their astronomical, mineralogical and botanical 
               experiments.

               At a large flat-topped table in the room sits Dr. Arthur 
               Carrington. He is a man of 43 with an alert, cheerful face. 
               He is good looking, well built, soft spoken. His dominant 
               characteristic is a smile that seems never to leave his lips. 
               It is present always on his face like an extra feature. He 
               is a genius of science and a man whose brain is focused like 
               a microscope on the secrets of nature. But the intensity of 
               his preoccupation with science is not to be heard in the 
               easy tones of his voice. It will be seen in the things he 
               does, in his point of view -- but never in his manner. 
               Outwardly, he seems only a good looking man full of child-
               like enthusiasm for a task and with a soothing, amiable way 
               for his fellow man.

               In the room with Dr. Carrington is a lean young man named 
               William Stone, in charge of the camp's photographic work and 
               equipment.

               Captain Henry stands silently in the doorway, his eyes moodily 
               on his scientific rival. The doctor is studying the indicator 
               dials of a complex instrument on the table. Bill Stone greets 
               the arrivals.

                                     STONE
                         Hello, Nikki. Hello, Captain Henry. 
                         How was the trip?

                                     HENRY
                              (shortly)
                         O. K.

               He remains staring at the preoccupied Carrington who seems 
               aware neither of his or Nikki's presence.

                                     NIKKI
                              (quietly)
                         Captain Henry is here, doctor.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (without looking up, 
                              his voice amiable)
                         Yes, I know.
                              (his eyes stay on the 
                              indicator dials and 
                              he continues softly)
                         Would you take these notes, please.
                              (he dictates to Nikki 
                              quietly. She writes 
                              as he speaks)
                         November second, 2 p.m. Deflection 
                         on screen nineteen continues -- twelve 
                         point three. No lessening or wavering 
                         of disturbing element.
                              (he looks up and smiles 
                              at Henry and adds 
                              softly)
                         Can we start now, Captain Henry?

                                     HENRY
                              (coolly)
                         Mind telling me where we're going?

                                     CARRINGTON
                         Forty-eight miles due east.

                                     HENRY
                         Your message said an aeroplane had 
                         crashed. Is that what we're looking 
                         for?

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (smiling)
                         I don't know, Captain.

                                     HENRY
                              (covering his 
                              irritation with 
                              difficulty)
                         I'd like to know what I'm supposed 
                         to go looking for, Dr. Carrington.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (gently)
                         So would I.
                              (eagerly)
                         I think we should start while the 
                         light holds.

                                     HENRY
                              (without moving)
                         We'll start after you've given me 
                         what information you've got.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (softly)
                         Is that necessary, Captain?
                              (he sees Henry's scowl 
                              and is quickly 
                              contrite)
                         I'm very sorry. I was thinking only 
                         of the vagueness of my information. 
                         I dislike being vague. Will you please 
                         read Captain Henry my first notes, 
                         Nikki?

                                     NIKKI
                              (opening the note 
                              book in her hand and 
                              reading from it)
                         November 1, 11:15 p.m. Sound detectors 
                         registered explosion due east. 11:18 
                         p.m. magnetic dial revealed twelve 
                         point three deflection. Such 
                         deflection possible only if a 
                         disturbing force equivalent to 20,000 
                         tons of steel or iron ore had become 
                         part of the earth within fifty mile 
                         radius.

                                     HENRY
                         That sounds like a meteor, doesn't 
                         it?

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (amiably)
                         Yes, very much. Except for our 
                         photographic plates. Our telescopic 
                         cameras were working last night. 
                         Here is the film taken between 11:12 
                         and 11:15. Let Captain Henry see it, 
                         Bill.

               Stone switches on a light in a moviola box and runs a strip 
               of film slowly through it. Captain Henry looks into the box.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         You will note the small dot low on 
                         the film. It is moving from west to 
                         east. At 11:14 the dot moves upward. 
                         At 11:15 it drops to the earth and 
                         vanishes. A meteor might move almost 
                         horizontally from west to east, but 
                         never upward. If the traveling object 
                         caused the explosion we picked up, 
                         it is in the ice 48 miles from here.  
                         The sound reached us four minutes 
                         after the object's disappearance.  
                         This gives us the approximate distance 
                         from here.

                                     HENRY
                              (frowning)
                         Twenty thousand tons of steel is a 
                         lot of metal for an aeroplane.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         For the sort of aeroplane we know, 
                         Captain.

                                     HENRY
                              (abruptly)
                         Come on, let's get going.

               He walks out followed by Carrington, Stone and Nikki.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. C-54 PLANE

               Captain Henry and Lieutenat Dykes are at the controls. The 
               rest of the crew are in their accustomed places. A dog sled 
               and a dog-team occupy the rear of the passenger cabin.

               Flight Engineer Barnes is scanning the snowscape below. So 
               are Photographer Stone and the scientists Olson, Chapman, 
               Vorrhees, Laurenz and Redding. Skeely is also peering avidly 
               out of the window. There is an air of tension to the silence.

               Only Dr. Carrington seems relaxed. He shares a seat with 
               Nikki.

               From time to time Captain Henry turns around to scowl at 
               Nikki and Carrington.

                                     NIKKI
                              (eagerly to her 
                              companion)
                         I'm terribly excited, Arthur! I'm 
                         jumping up and down inside!

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (softly)
                         So am I.

                                     NIKKI
                              (laughing)
                         If the world were coming to an end, 
                         I don't think you'd change your 
                         expression, Arthur. You'd keep smiling -- 
                         and dictating notes -- and expect me 
                         to take them down accurately.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (nodding)
                         And you would.

               Captain Henry has risen and left Dykes at the controls. He 
               has walked back to Carrington and stood there waiting grimly 
               for their talk to end. He speaks up now with irritation.

                                     HENRY
                         We're fifty miles out, Doctor, and 
                         not a sign of anything. Those gadgets 
                         of yours must be screwy.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (amiably)
                         I doubt it, Captain. They've exhibited 
                         no signs of lunacy in the past.

                                     NIKKI
                              (to Henry)
                         You must be off your course.

                                     HENRY
                              (to Carrington, 
                              insistantly, ignoring 
                              Nikki)
                         We haven't seen anything, have we? 
                         What does that mean?

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (amiably)
                         It means we haven't seen it. It 
                         doesn't mean it isn't there.

               Henry's response is interrupted by a cry from Dykes.

                                     DYKES
                         Hey, Pat! Look at this! The compass 
                         is turning around!

                                     HENRY
                              (starting forward)
                         What the holy --

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (calmly)
                         We've passed it.
                              (calling to Dykes)
                         When did it start turning, Lieutenant?

                                     DYKES
                         Just now -- fifteen seconds ago.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (to Nikki)
                         Mark the time, please.
                              (to Dykes)
                         Is it a complete revolution?

                                     DYKES
                         Yep. Hundred and eighty degrees.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (to Henry)
                         Then we flew right over it about a 
                         mile and three eighths back.

                                     HENRY
                              (curtly)
                         Thanks.
                              (he calls to the 
                              cockpit)
                         Spin it around Eddie, and take her 
                         down low.

               Henry returns to the cockpit. Carrington follows him and 
               stands gazing out over his shoulder.

               LONG SHOT OF ICE FIELD FROM SHIP'S POINT OF VIEW

               A dark patch in the ice appears.

               INT. COCKPIT

                                     CARRINGTON AND DYKES
                              (together)
                         There -- I see it -- over there!

                                     DYKES
                         It's buried in the ice.

                                     HENRY
                              (peering at the ground)
                         What do you think, Eddie?

                                     DYKES
                              (pointing)
                         Looks pretty smooth over there --

                                     HENRY
                              (nodding)
                         Fasten your seat belts, folks. We're 
                         going to land.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE ICE PLANE

               The C-54 lands gracefully on its skis. Its occupants 
               disembark. Barnes and Dykes start hitching up the dog team.

                                     NIKKI
                              (standing on tiptoe)
                         I can't see it from here.

                                     HENRY
                         It's that way. About a half mile.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         A little more south, I believe.

                                     NIKKI
                         Oh, I hope we don't lose it.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (smiling at her 
                              eagerness)
                         Hardly.

                                     MACAULIFF
                         This'll lead us right to it.

               He holds up a Geiger counter.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (surprised)
                         A Geiger counter. But there's no 
                         reason to suppose it's radioactive.

                                     MACAULIFF
                         It is, though. I noticed in the plane. 
                         See?

               He holds up the counter. It clicks steadily.

                                     DYKES
                         All set, folks.

                                     HENRY
                              (to Nikki)
                         You ride on the sled.

               Nikki gets on the sled. It starts off, the rest of the party 
               trotting along in its tracks.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE ICE PLAIN NEAR THE DARK PATCH

               The sled stops. Nikki gets off and runs with the others to 
               the dark patch. They stand looking down at it from a little 
               hillock of snow and ice.

                                     BARNES
                         That's no aeroplane.

                                     OLSON
                         It's certainly not a meteor.

                                     MACAULIFF
                         Whatever it is, how in the holy name 
                         of Aberdeen, did it get in there? 
                         Look, the ice is smooth as glass.

               There is a little chorus of agreement and wonder.

                                     HENRY
                         This is the craziest thing I ever 
                         saw!

                                     CARRINGTON
                         Not really.

                                     HENRY
                              (over polite)
                         Perhaps you'll be good enough to 
                         explain the little mystery to all us 
                         ordinary people.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (staring at the dark 
                              patch)
                         Anything hitting the earth's 
                         atmosphere at an astronomical speed 
                         would be white hot in an instant. It 
                         would melt its way into the ice which 
                         would then freeze over it again.

               Skeely and Barnes have moved to another hillock to get a 
               better view of the buried object. Suddenly Skeely lets out a 
               yell.

                                     SKEELY
                              (at the top of his 
                              lungs)
                         IT'S A SAUCER! IT'S A FLYING SAUCER!

               There is an instant's silence. They all stare into the ice.

                                     OLSON
                              (softly)
                         Bless my soul, that's what it is!

                                     AD LIB
                         A saucer! A flying disc! Sure, look 
                         from over here -- see? A real, honest-
                         to-God saucer! See the direction 
                         vanes... They said there were no 
                         such things... D'ya suppose there's 
                         anyone in it? Must be... Sure...

                                     SKEELY
                              (jumping with 
                              excitement)
                         Axes! Get some ice-axes!

               Barnes and Dykes run for axes.

                                     STONE
                         Stand back, everybody! Let me get 
                         some pictures!

                                     SKEELY
                              (widly, as Stone starts 
                              photographing)
                         Where's the radio generator! Hey, 
                         MacAuliff!
                              (MacAuliff turns to 
                              him)
                         Scotty, come on, quick! I want to 
                         send a message!

                                     HENRY
                              (interrupting)
                         Nothing doing. No private messages.

                                     SKEELY
                         What do you mean, private! I'm going 
                         to send it to the whole world!

                                     HENRY
                         Sorry, Skeely. This is army 
                         information. I'll have to wait for 
                         authority to let you file a story.

                                     SKEELY
                              (beside himself)
                         You've got your authority from the 
                         Constitution of the United States! 
                         It's called freedom of the press! 
                         I'm sending my story, Captain!

                                     HENRY
                         All right, send it. But not from my 
                         ship.

               Skeely glares at him in frustrated fury. Henry ignores 
               Skeely's rage, and turns to MacAuliff.

                                     HENRY
                         Call Hendrix... Have him wire Fogarty 
                         we've found a flying disc -- intact -- 
                         imbedded in the ice -- and we're 
                         going to get it out!

                                     MACAULIFF
                         Yes, sir.

               He starts for the plane -- Skeely at his heels.

                                     SKEELY
                              (urgently)
                         Looky, Scotty! This is the biggest 
                         story since the Red Sea! A ship from 
                         another planet! You can't cover it 
                         up! Have a heart! Think what this 
                         means to the world!

                                     MACAULIFF
                         I'm not working for the world. I'm 
                         working for the army, and I've got 
                         my orders.

                                     SKEELY
                              (furiously)
                         Even the Russians wouldn't act like 
                         this!

               He starts back toward Captain Henry.

                                     OLSON
                              (to Carrington)
                         What do you make of that, Arthur? It 
                         certainly doesn't look like 20,000 
                         tons of steel.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         Not even a ton, I'd say.

               During the above, axes have arrived. Five of the men start 
               hacking feverishly through the ice. Nikki stands beside 
               Carrington. Captain Henry joins the men chopping on the ice. 
               The little group on the wind-swept snow work silently and 
               desperately to remove the four feet covering of ice from the 
               saucer.

                                     CHAPMAN
                              (coming up to 
                              Carrington)
                         What do you think it's made of, 
                         Arthur?

                                     CARRINGTON
                         No element we know on this earth.

                                     NIKKI
                              (excitedly)
                         I don't see any door or windows in 
                         it.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         They must be underneath.

                                     OLSON
                              (peering)
                         I can't make out any engine.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         I doubt if we'll find anything we 
                         call an engine.

                                     SKEELY
                              (arriving out of breath)
                         What planet do you figure it's from, 
                         Doctor?

                                     CARRINGTON
                         Not this one.

                                     SKEELY
                         Must be Mars. That's the only one 
                         that's supposed to be inhabited, 
                         isn't it?

                                     CARRINGTON
                         I'll be able to answer your questions 
                         a little more accurately after I've 
                         examined the interior of the craft 
                         and its occupants, if any.

               Skeely grabs an axe and runs toward the chopping group.

                                     NIKKI
                         Occupants! They must be dead, though!

                                     CARRINGTON
                         Dead or alive -- we'll learn a great 
                         many things we don't know in the 
                         world, now.

               The group is swinging axes. Captain Henry suddenly stops 
               digging. He looks up at the sun looks at his watch.

                                     HENRY
                              (to Dykes)
                         We can't make it, Eddie. The light'll 
                         be gone in an hour. The temperature's 
                         dropping, too, I think.

                                     EDDIE
                              (looking toward the 
                              horizon)
                         That storm front's moving in fast. 
                         But we can't quit. We've got to keep 
                         going! It's from Mars!

                                     HENRY
                         I'm not going to try an instrument 
                         landing on skis in the dark -- and 
                         kill off everybody.

                                     EDDIE
                              (eagerly)
                         We can dig for another half hour, 
                         Pat.

                                     HENRY
                         If they get that close -- I'll never 
                         get them back in the ship. They're 
                         so excited now they don't know they're 
                         half frozen.

                                     EDDIE
                              (excitedly)
                         Look, Pat -- I feel fine. I'll stay 
                         here all night. Just leave me a 
                         sleeping bag and some whiskey.

                                     HENRY
                              (suddenly)
                         I got a thermite bomb on the sled. 
                         Go get it. We'll melt the ice away.

                                     EDDIE
                              (axe in hand)
                         Wonderful! What a brain!

               He runs toward the sled. At the same moment one of the diggers 
               cries out.

                                     BARNES
                              (axe in hand)
                         Here's a piece in the open! We've 
                         uncovered it!

               The scientists and the axe wielders run over to Barnes. 
               Captain Henry comes over. Dr. Carrington drops to his knees 
               and examines a two foot metal edge protruding from the ice.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         May I have a file, please?

                                     BARNES
                         Here's one.

               He removes a file from his heavy clothes. The group watches 
               as Dr. Carrington starts using the file on the protruding 
               edge of the saucer.

                                     CHAPMAN
                         What's it look like, Arthur?

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (hitting the file 
                              against it)
                         I don't know. Probably an alloy. 
                         I'll try and get some filings. We 
                         can analyze them tonight.
                              (he looks up and smiles 
                              at the group watching 
                              him)
                         We haven't much time. I suggest you 
                         all continue with your excavating.

                                     HENRY
                         No need to. We've got a thermite 
                         bomb.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (pleased)
                         Thermite! Oh, excellent!

               He stops filing and rises. He stands staring down at the 
               machine in the ice. Lieut. Dykes arrives with a thermite 
               bomb, a length of wire and a plunger. MacAuliff comes running 
               up at the same moment.

                                     MACAULIFF
                              (panting)
                         They're relaying the message to 
                         Fogarty now. We ought to have an 
                         answer in an hour. I got some news 
                         back from Hendrix. The barometer 
                         fell down to the cellar and a freeze 
                         is coming up like nobody's business. 
                         He says to watch out.

                                     HENRY
                         I'm watching. Drill a hole for that 
                         bomb, Eddie.

                                     SKEELY
                              (moving in to the 
                              group in time to 
                              hear the last remark)
                         A bomb? Is that safe?

                                     DYKES
                              (as he digs the hole, 
                              Barnes assisting)
                         It's S.O.P. Standard Operating 
                         Procedure for removing ice. It just 
                         melts it.

                                     BARNES
                         It'll uncover the whole saucer in 
                         thirty seconds.

                                     NIKKI
                         I'm so excited, I'm almost sick to 
                         my stomach.

                                     HENRY
                              (to Dykes)
                         That's deep enough, Eddie. The light's 
                         going fast.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (softly, as he 
                              continues to stare 
                              at the metal mass at 
                              his feet)
                         Five minutes from now we may have 
                         the key to the stars. A million years 
                         of history are waiting in that ice 
                         for us.

                                     DYKES
                         All set, Pat.

                                     HENRY
                         Clear the field, Mac.

                                     MACAULIFF
                              (calling)
                         Over here -- everybody. Keep together.

               The crew and scientists and Nikki move across the ice, led 
               by MacAuliff. Eddie uncoils a hundred feet of wire and walks 
               with it. Captain Henry stands in the increasing wind -- 
               surveying the dimly outlined ship in the ice.

                                     HENRY
                              (raising his arm)
                         Let her go, Eddie.

               Eddie presses the plunger. There is the normal thermite bomb 
               explosion. A glow of the thermite flares and dies.

                                     EDDIE
                              (calling out)
                         O.K., folks. She's clear.

               Before anyone can move there is a muffled explosion. And a 
               second flare starts under the ice. Gradually the glare builds 
               up. The whole ice field becomes illuminated from beneath by 
               an unbearable light. The onlookers are forced to turn their 
               eyes away, all save Carrington, and Henry who continue to 
               stare at it.

               A chorus of exclamations and queries rise from the group.

                                     AD LIB
                         What is it? What happened -- Secondary 
                         explosion? Don't look -- Shield your 
                         eyes! How can it burn -- in the ice? 
                         Chain reaction -- from the thermite! 
                         Etc.

                                     SKEELY
                              (grabbing Chapman's 
                              arm)
                         What's happening to it. Tell me, 
                         Doc!

                                     CHAPMAN
                              (slowly)
                         I'm afraid it's disintegrating -- 
                         totally.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (his face tense)
                         Secrets -- that might have given us 
                         a new science. Gone!

               Captain Henry stands aghast as the wild burning consumes the 
               ship under the ice. He sees its outlines run and vanish. 
               Skeely comes up to him.

                                     SKEELY
                              (raging)
                         Standard Operating Procedure, you 
                         blind ape! You've destroyed it!

                                     CARRINGTON
                         I should have thought -- I should 
                         have thought...

                                     SKEELY
                         You sure should! The greatest 
                         discovery in history up flames! Fine 
                         work!
                              (he wheels on Henry)
                         The army can be proud of itself -- 
                         turning a whole civilization into a 
                         Fourth of July piece. Even the Indians 
                         acted smarter toward Columbus!

                                     CHAPMAN
                         Not a shred left. Every bit of it 
                         gone -- and we know nothing -- 
                         nothing.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         We know one thing... what it was 
                         made of. Obviously a magnesium alloy.

                                     CHAPMAN
                         That's right. Only magnesium would 
                         react to heat that way.

                                     SKEELY
                              (bitterly)
                         Splendid! There's a story for me.
                              (quoting)
                         Scientists learn magnesium burns!

                                     DYKES
                              (to Henry)
                         Want me to mark the spot -- so we 
                         can find it after the storm?

               Captain Henry has been staring into the wind-swept ice. He 
               has stood silent under Skeely's abuse.

                                     HENRY
                              (to Dykes)
                         Later, Eddie. First, I want you to 
                         bring up all your picks and axes. 
                         Mac, I want your Geiger counter. And 
                         bring the dog sled.

                                     MACAULIFF
                         Where to?

                                     HENRY
                         I saw something under the ice about 
                         fifty feet from here. The flare lit 
                         it up.

               He holds the Geiger counter in front of him and starts walking 
               slowly. Carrington, Ericson, Barnes, Dykes and Skeely move 
               along at his side. The others straggle behind, MacAuliff 
               leading the dog team.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         What was it, Captain?

                                     HENRY
                         I don't know. It was shaped like a 
                         man, but it might have been a piece 
                         of the disk.

                                     DYKES
                         A man! You mean somebody got out of 
                         that saucer?

                                     HENRY
                         Probably thrown out when it crashed. 
                         If it is a man.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (gesturing toward the 
                              counter, which is 
                              clicking)
                         It's radio active. I imagine it must 
                         be a fragment from the saucer.

                                     HENRY
                         Maybe. It was sure man-shaped, though.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (with growing 
                              excitement)
                         Good work, Captain. We may salvage 
                         something yet.

                                     SKEELY
                              (pointing at the 
                              counter)
                         It's getting louder. More to your 
                         left, I think.

                                     DYKES
                              (pointing off)
                         There it is! There!

               He points to an ice bank. Dimly visible in the ice is a two 
               legged shape.

                                     SKEELY
                         Is this a story! The man from Mars!

                                     MACAULIFF
                              (excitedly)
                         It's got legs -- and a head. I can 
                         see 'em.

                                     NIKKI
                         It is! It's a man... It really is!

               There is an ad lib chorus of excited remarks from the others.

                                     AD LIB
                         There -- see it? Look -- right by 
                         that boulder! It's an animal. No -- 
                         it's a man. Must be eight feet long. 
                         Etc.

                                     EDDIE
                         How come it's frozen in the ice -- 
                         if it was thrown clear?

                                     HENRY
                              (chopping at the ice)
                         Same as the saucer. Got melted in.

                                     SKEELY
                              (chopping at the ice)
                         How about using some thermite?

                                     HENRY
                         Shut up!

               The men continue to swing their axes. MacAuliff has stepped 
               into a small depression in the ice and is closest to the 
               figure they are trying to extricate. The ice surrounding it 
               has become flawed from their blows, and the figure it contains 
               is practically invisible.

                                     BARNES
                              (chopping)
                         I can't see it at all now.

                                     SKEELY
                         Hurry up, boys. I can't wait.
                              (to Henry)
                         Sure hope it isn't a mirage.

                                     HENRY
                         No mirage. It's there all right.

                                     BARNES
                         What did it look like in the flare?

                                     HENRY
                         You'll believe it when you see it.

                                     MACAULIFF
                              (from below)
                         Hey --

                                     HENRY
                         What's wrong, Mac?

                                     MACAULIFF
                              (staggering away from 
                              the block they have 
                              carved out)
                         I'm sick to my stomach. I sunk my 
                         pick right into its skull -- something 
                         green oozed out.

                                     EDDIE
                         No harm done. It was dead anyway.

                         The light's going, Pat. We haven't 
                         got time.

                                     HENRY
                         You're right.

                                     BARNES
                         Hey, look. The whole block's coming 
                         loose!

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (nodding)
                         Recently formed ice. Separates easily.

                                     HENRY
                         All right -- everybody on it. We'll 
                         load the whole slab onto the sled.

               They load the block onto the dog sled, and start hauling it 
               across the ice field.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. POLAR CAMP. THE LIGHT IS ALMOST GONE

               The C-54 appears in the lowering sky. It flies erratically 
               in the increasing wind.

               The plane makes a precarious landing on its skis, the rising 
               gale buffeting, and almost overturning it.

               A half dozen bundled Eskimos come out of the camp and move 
               toward the plane.

               Barnes, Eddie and MacAuliff pile out. They help Nikki and 
               the scientists alight. In the half dark, the passengers start 
               across the wind-blasted snow toward the camp. They move with 
               difficulty. Words are inaudible in the gale.

               MacAuliff gestures the Eskimos toward the plane. They climb 
               in. Captain Henry and Eddie bring out the dogs and a sled.

               The block of ice, half covered by a tarpaulin, is dropped 
               from the plane's door.

               Working in the icy blasts now sweeping the dark, the men 
               move the ice-block onto a sled. Others tie the plane down, 
               tethering it to stakes pounded into the ice.

               With the plane tied down, the party starts for the camp. The 
               dogs draw the sled with the ice-block on it.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXTERIOR ENTRANCE TO STOREROOM

               A series of steps have been cut through the snowbank outside 
               the storeroom entrance. The ice-block is unloaded from the 
               sled and bumped down the steep steps.

               INT. STORE ROOM

               It is a dimly lit room, piled with barrels of scientific 
               equipment. It has the look of a gloomy well stocked cellar.

               The ice-block is slid into a clear space in the middle of 
               the room. Barrels and boxes are moved to make more room around 
               it, all the group assisting.

                                     HENRY
                              (to Eddie)
                         Send the Eskimos away.

                                     EDDIE
                         They've hot footed it already. It's 
                         going to take a lot of coaxing to 
                         get them back.

                                     MACAULIFF
                         Anyone got some whiskey?

                                     EDDIE
                              (poking among some 
                              boxes)
                         Here's a whole bar room.

               He removes a bottle and starts opening it.

                                     BARNES
                              (to Henry, nervously)
                         What do we do now, unveil him?

                                     HENRY
                         Nothing to see through the ice.
                              (to Carrington)
                         Can you turn off the heat in this 
                         room, Doctor?

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (softly)
                         If it's necessary.

                                     EDDIE
                         What d'you mean, turn off the heat. 
                         It's fifty below outside.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         I suggest we discuss our procedure 
                         before we take any further steps.

                                     HENRY
                              (to Eddie)
                         Open the window, Eddie.

               Eddie stares at him and climbs up to the window.

                                     LAURENZ
                              (full of tension, his 
                              eyes on the tarp 
                              covered block of ice)
                         We're wasting time, Captain! We must 
                         melt it out. Investigate! Examine!

                                     HENRY
                         We're not melting it out.

                                     EDDIE
                              (from the ladder top)
                         The window's closed.

                                     HENRY
                         Punch a hole in it.

               Eddie breaks the window.

                                     LAURENZ
                         This is stupid! Criminal! The secrets 
                         of a universe are in there. We are 
                         scientists!

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (quietly)
                         It's almost certain that we'll be 
                         called in by the army to make a study 
                         of it later, Captain.

                                     LAURENZ
                         You can't fly the thing to Dutch 
                         Harbor! This storm may last for weeks. 
                         No human can walk in it.

                                     HENRY
                         I'm sorry, gentlemen. I'll wait 
                         instructions from General Fogarty.

                                     SKEELY
                              (quietly)
                         I think you're making a crazy 
                         decision. There's no army precedent 
                         for how to treat a Martian. And nobody 
                         is better qualified to take our 
                         visitor apart than these gentlemen 
                         of science. You couldn't ask for 
                         more geniuses at an autopsy.

                                     HENRY
                         It's staying in the ice.

                                     LAURENZ
                         You're behaving like a meddlesome 
                         sophomore, Captain Henry! There are 
                         organisms that survive after death. 
                         Cold may destroy them.

                                     REDDING
                              (quietly)
                         They may be dangerous organisms. 
                         Disease germs from another planet. 
                         We're not prepared medically to cope 
                         with them.

                                     LAURENZ
                         That is absolute nonsense, Redding!

                                     REDDING
                         Nor do we know what effect the air 
                         of our earth may have on the 
                         creature's remains.

                                     HENRY
                         Yes, I'd feel kind of foolish if 
                         this thing disappeared in a cloud of 
                         smoke like that saucer did.

                                     LAURENZ
                              (to Carrington)
                         Arthur, you are in charge of this 
                         post.

                                     VOORHEES
                         We have every right to proceed 
                         scientifically.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (controlling himself)
                         Captain Henry, I can only urge you 
                         in the interest of human knowledge 
                         to permit us to examine the body in 
                         there --

                                     LAURENZ
                              (excitedly)
                         We don't have to be permitted! We 
                         have thirty men in this camp -- all 
                         armed.

                                     HENRY
                         Your request is denied, Dr. 
                         Carrington. That ice-block and what's 
                         in it is army property. And this is 
                         a military installation. As head of 
                         the military here, I'm taking over.

                                     SKEELY
                         Martial law, eh!

                                     HENRY
                         Until I receive instructions from my 
                         superior officer on what to do -- 
                         we'll mark time. I'm posting a guard 
                         to keep everybody out -- and 
                         everybody's hands off -- in the 
                         meantime.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (softly)
                         Captain Henry is doing what he 
                         considers right.
                              (to Henry)
                         It's difficult for me to mark time -- 
                         with such amazing information waiting 
                         for us -- but I accept your decision. 
                         I suggest that your guard use one of 
                         our electric blankets to keep warm. 
                         Will you get him one, Fred.

               A mechanic present nods.

                                     HENRY
                         Thanks. How do we get to your radio 
                         room?

                                     CARRINGTON
                         I'll show you.
                              (he starts out)

                                     SKEELY
                              (excitedly)
                         The radio room! I'm getting senile! 
                         I forgot all about it.

               Skeely starts out.

                                     EDDIE
                         Mind if I have a last peek at our 
                         pal --

               He goes to the ice-block, and pulls off the tarpaulin. The 
               dim two-legged shape is blurringly visible inside the block.

                                     HENRY
                         Come on, Eddie.

                                     EDDIE
                              (staring at the frosted 
                              ice-cake)
                         I can't quite make it out yet, but I 
                         know one thing. They don't breed 'em 
                         for beauty on Mars.

               The rest of the group leaves through the inner door. We stay 
               with Ken. He stands alone in the cellar, leaning against a 
               barrel. He picks up a whiskey bottle and takes a swig. Then 
               he approaches the block of ice. He stares into it for a moment 
               and backs away. He removes his gun from its holster, and 
               resumes his place leaning against the barrels, his eyes 
               nervously on the ice-block.

               INT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR - CONNECTING CELLAR AND RADIO 
               BUILDING

               Led by Dr. Carrington, the group moves down the shadowy 
               length. Skeely is talking as he walks beside Captain Henry.

                         when this story hits the headlines! 
                         Everybody who owns a sled is going 
                         to start for the North Pole for a 
                         look at the man from Mars. Gentlemen, 
                         you'll be doing a bigger business 
                         than Coney Island in a week! What a

                         a live Martian! That would have been 
                         something, eh?  Look, Captain, you've 
                         got to let these boys get at that 
                         corpse as soon as possible. Our 
                         readers will be waiting for details. 
                         You're liable to give the whole nation 
                         a nervous breakdown.

               INT. RADIO ROOM

               The entire communication equipment of the post is housed 
               here. A step-ladder leads to a trap-door which in turn leads 
               to a small observation tower above the radio room. Sitting 
               at, the radio controls is Ezra Hendrix, the operator.

               The group enters. Ezra is a stocky young man. He is full of 
               excitement as he turns to the arrivals.

                                     EZRA
                         I'm using full power. The lousy pole 
                         is shooting electricity all over the 
                         place.

                                     HENRY
                         I'm Captain Henry. Any messages for 
                         me?

                                     EZRA
                         Yes. Came through a few minutes ago.
                              (he reads from a piece 
                              of paper)
                         Fogarty to Henry. Remove flying saucer 
                         from ice at once. Use thermite bomb 
                         to melt her out. Erect temporary 
                         structure to protect find until my 
                         arrival with staff chiefs.

                              (beaming)
                         That's what I like about the army. 
                         Smart -- all the way to the top.
                              (to Henry)
                         Well, Captain, that gives you a chance 
                         to pass the buck on that thermite 
                         deal.

                                     HENRY
                              (ignoring him)
                         Will you send this to General Fogarty?

                                     SKEELY
                         Make it short, will you, Captain? 
                         There's a hundred and fifty million 
                         people holding their breaths --

                                     HENRY
                              (to Ezra)
                         Henry to Fogarty. Flying saucer 
                         completely destroyed by thermite 
                         bomb, due to unforeseen composition 
                         of ship. Have removed dead passenger 
                         from wreck...

                                     EZRA
                              (as he taps the key)
                         You got a Martian? Where is he?

                                     SKEELY
                         On ice, buddy. Hurry it up -- I've 
                         got a flash for you.

                                     EZRA
                              (tapping)
                         The static's knocking us out of the 
                         air.

                                     HENRY

                         before further action. That's all.

                              (he dictates)
                         With Carrington expedition. North 
                         Pole -- The world has a new visitor 
                         today, a two legged creature from 
                         Mars.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         You are being a little premature, 
                         Mr. Skeely. That has not been 
                         established.

                                     SKEELY
                         You can un-establish it -- if I'm 
                         wrong, Doctor.

                                     EZRA
                         It's dead.

                                     SKEELY
                              (angrily)
                         I know it's dead.

                                     EZRA
                         I mean the sender. Nothing's going 
                         out.

                                     SKEELY
                         Keep clicking, man! It can't quit on 
                         you now!

               Another telegraph clicking sound comes through.

                                     EZRA
                         Something's coming in.

               He starts writing.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         It will alter our situation, Captain -- 
                         if we can't get through to your 
                         General.

                                     HENRY
                         The situation remains as it is -- 
                         until we do.

                                     EZRA
                              (reading from the 
                              paper on which he 
                              has been writing)
                         Everything grounded -- can't join 
                         you. Want you to --
                              (he looks up)
                         The rest is scrambled, Captain.  
                         Can't pick it up.

                                     HENRY
                         He didn't get my message?

                                     EZRA
                         Doesn't look like it. We're a weaker 
                         station than the one at your base, 
                         Captain. I may be able to pick them 
                         up -- if they keep sending -- but 
                         our outgoing stuff is hopeless.

                                     SKEELY
                         Lookie! You can't stop! I've got to 
                         get this story through. Send it 
                         anyway. Some ham may pick it up -- 
                         there's millions of them. Send it!
                              (to Henry)
                         Pat, how about heading back for Dutch 
                         Harbor?

                                     HENRY
                         I don't think we can get as far as 
                         the plane -- in this wind.

                                     SKEELY
                              (desperately, as he 
                              leans over Ezra)
                         Keep hitting it, pal! Somebody'll 
                         get it -- somewhere. Keep clicking...

               Ezra clicks desperately away on his instrument. The group 
               stands waiting and silent.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BEDROOM OF THE POST.  NIGHT

               This is a large dormitory with cot beds in it, lining the 
               walls. Henry, Eddie, Barnes and Skeely are in the room.

               Skeely is walking up and down, peering out of the window at 
               the storming night.

               Eddie sits on a cot. Barnes is curled up on another cot. 
               Henry is at a window, looking out.

                                     EDDIE
                         You know something? These scientists 
                         here remind me of the time I was 
                         stuck on Bulan Island with the Hundred 
                         and Sixteenth. An army nurse came 
                         ashore one day and created a 
                         disturbance similar to this Martian.

                                     BARNES
                              (from his cot)
                         What happened to her, Lieutenant?

                                     EDDIE
                         Nothin' she didn't like. I'm just 
                         wondering if the professors will try 
                         to rush us, Pat.

                                     HENRY
                              (grimly)
                         Might relieve the monotony if they 
                         did.

                                     EDDIE
                         I'd hate to have to shoot down 
                         seventeen of the world's greatest 
                         geniuses. You know somethin'?

                                     HENRY
                         What?

                                     EDDIE
                         They're kids, all of them. Nine year 
                         olds drooling over a new fire engine. 
                         Scientists! Did you notice those two 
                         double domes who started crying -- 
                         when we left the table?

                                     SKEELY
                              (suddenly)
                         This storm is getting worse, Captain.

                                     HENRY
                         Yes, it's tossing around some.

                                     SKEELY
                         There's only one thing we can do -- 
                         dog sleds! We can wrap General Fogarty 
                         up and take him along.

                                     EDDIE
                         Fogarty?

                                     SKEELY
                         That's my name for our pretty boy 
                         from Mars. He has the same dubious 
                         relation to a human being as that 
                         pot-bellied clam in Dutch Harbor. 
                         Dog sleds, Captain, are our only 
                         solution.

                                     HENRY
                         Solution to what?

                                     SKEELY
                         Getting out of here -- we could make 
                         the base in five days --

                                     HENRY
                         Cut the yammering, will you. I've 
                         got enough on my mind. It's death 
                         outside. The storm will knock off 
                         even the Polar bears.

               The door opens and MacAuliff enters.

                                     MACAULIFF
                         He's going crazy.

                                     EDDIE
                         Who?

                                     MACAULIFF
                         Fogarty.

                                     EDDIE
                         Which one?

                                     MACAULIFF
                         Are you nuts? There's only one 
                         Fogarty.

                                     EDDIE
                         There's two now. Skeely's baptized 
                         our Martian with the same name.

                                     HENRY
                         What about the General?

                                     MACAULIFF
                         Incoming stuff is pretty jammed. But 
                         I've figured it to read there's been 
                         a leak in Washington. News of our 
                         find has made the papers. Congress 
                         and the President and a lot of other 
                         top brass want further details.

                         They're not picking up anything from 
                         us?

                         Not a crackle.

               SKEELY laughs.

                                     HENRY
                              (frowning)
                         What's the joke, Skeely?

                                     SKEELY
                              (chuckling)
                         A picture of my editor just came to 
                         me... tearing up and down his office -- 
                         breaking windows and yelling for 
                         Skeely. I can almost hear him. He's 
                         liable to shoot himself by midnight.

               The door flings open. Navigator Ken Ericson enters. He is in 
               a high state of agitation.

                              (sitting up)

                         relieve me at eleven.

                         Take what?

                         You can see it now! The ice has 
                         cleared up. It's got crazy hands. No 
                         ears, and a lot of eyes. They're all 
                         open! I turned a flash on it -- and 
                         it looked like it was moving. And I 
                         lit out.

                                     HENRY
                         Get back to your post.

                         Yes, sir.

               He turns and walks slowly out of the room.

                                     SKEELY
                         I'm going to have a look.

                                     HENRY
                         You're staying out of there, Skeely -- 
                         along with everybody else. Put on 
                         your flightsuit, Barnes. And get in 
                         there before Ken starts having 
                         kittens.

                              flying suit)
                         That's the first squawk I've heard 
                         out of Ken since Ploesti. I don't 
                         like it.

                         All I want is to verify what I know -- 
                         about it's being four-eyed.

                                     EDDIE
                         He didn't say four eyes. He said --

                                     HENRY
                         Never mind what he said. I'm barring 
                         all civilians.

                                     SKEELY
                         You're being a little stuffy about 
                         this whole thing, Captain Henry.

                                     BARNES
                         I won't need the electric blanket -- 
                         if I got this suit plugged in. So in 
                         case you care to send me any company, 
                         I could make them comfortable, 
                         Captain.

                                     HENRY
                         I'll relieve you myself at 2 a.m.  
                         And don't leave your post.

                                     EDDIE
                         Pat's right, Barney. If you give 
                         them a chance, those scientists will 
                         have him out -- waltzing with him.

                         O.K., Captain. I'll expect you at 2 
                         a.m.

                                     HENRY
                         Right.

               Barnes opens the door. Nikki is in the doorway. She is dressed 
               in a fetching looking outfit.

                         Good evening, Miss Nicholson.

                                     NIKKI
                         Hello. May I come in?

                                     HENRY
                              (coolly)
                         We're a bit untidy.

                                     NIKKI
                              (smiling at him)
                         Dreadfully unsocial atmosphere around, 
                         even for the North Pole.

                                     HENRY
                         I'm sorry to have contributed to 
                         your gloom, Miss Nicholson.

                                     NIKKI
                         Miss Nicholson! Is that what happens 
                         under martial law -- everybody loses 
                         their nicknames?

                              (stiffly)
                         Did you want to see me about anything 
                         in particular?

                                     NIKKI
                         No. I was having a drink -- all by 
                         myself in my room... and playing the 
                         phonograph. And I suddenly felt I 
                         was being very selfish. All that 
                         lovely music, only for me.

                                     HENRY
                              (smiling at her)
                         Want company?

                                     NIKKI
                         That's what I'm hinting at, Mistah 
                         Henry.

                                     HENRY
                              (to Eddie)
                         I'll be in Miss Nicholson's quarters 
                         if anything comes up.

                                     SKEELY
                         I take it Miss Nicholson's quarters 
                         are also out of bounds for civilians.

                                     HENRY
                         During army occupation only.

               He moves Nikki through the door.

               INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE NIKKI'S ROOM

               Nikki and Captain Henry approach it. They walk in silence.  
               Nikki opens the door.

                              (a bit sarcastically)
                         You sure you trust me with little 
                         you all alone in your bedroom?

                                     NIKKI
                         Yes, I think I can.

                                     HENRY
                         Very manly. You ought to wear pants.

                                     NIKKI
                              (giggling)
                         I do.

                                     HENRY
                              (handing her a drink)
                         Outside of that news, what's on your 
                         mind.

                                     NIKKI
                         I want a favor.

                                     HENRY
                         Uh -- huh...

                                     NIKKI
                              (producing a bathrobe 
                              cord)
                         I want to tie your hands behind your 
                         back.

                                     HENRY
                              (in a sudden temper)
                         Oh, for -- Look, you asked me in 
                         here -- I didn't break down the door -- 
                         why make a production of --

                                     NIKKI
                         Please, Pat. I said it was a favor...

                                     HENRY
                              (grudgingly)
                         All right, then. But no practical 
                         jokes. Promise?

                                     NIKKI
                         I promise.
                              (indicating chair)
                         Here. Sit here. And put your hands 
                         around the back.

                                     HENRY
                              (obeying)
                         The Secretary of Defense will never 
                         understand this.

                                     NIKKI
                              (as she ties)
                         It's all very simple. First there's 
                         a boogyman in a cake of ice down in 
                         the cellar. I've got a small case of 
                         jumps, and I want company.

                                     HENRY
                         Is this the way you usually entertain 
                         your company?

                                     NIKKI
                              (she has finished 
                              tying his hands)
                         How about a drink.

                                     HENRY
                         I'd love it. And a long straw, please.

                                     NIKKI
                              (picking up a glass 
                              and holding it for 
                              Henry while he drinks)
                         Second, I want you to know that out 
                         on the ice today, I noticed the way 
                         you jumped in between me and the 
                         exlosion...

                                     HENRY
                              (patiently)
                         Could we get to the point? Why am I 
                         tied up?

                                     NIKKI
                         Because I want to tell you how much 
                         I admire you without getting 
                         fingerprints all over my clavicle.

                                     HENRY
                              (sourly)
                         Thanks for the compliment. Both of 
                         them.

                                     NIKKI
                         Another drink?

                                     HENRY
                         After you.

                                     NIKKI
                         I'm going to have a straight one. 
                         But don't get your hopes up. Liquor 
                         doesn't make me amorous.

                                     HENRY
                              (as she tosses off a 
                              drink)
                         It ought to. Nothing else does.

                                     NIKKI
                              (eyeing him steadily)
                         I liked the way you handled yourself 
                         today, Pat. And I liked the way you 
                         stood up to all the big wigs, and 
                         refused to let them play around with 
                         the -- with the thing.

                                     HENRY
                         You like everything about me, but 
                         me, is that it?

                                     NIKKI
                         No. I like you, too. In fact, I'm 
                         going to kiss you.

                                     HENRY
                         Untie me, honey.

                                     NIKKI
                         No. I'm going to kiss you, not wrestle 
                         you.

                                     HENRY
                              (muttering)
                         Talk about Japanese tortures --

               Nikki kisses him briefly and precisely.

                                     NIKKI
                         That was very nice.

                                     HENRY
                         Was it?

                                     NIKKI
                         Very.
                              (she pours herself 
                              another drink)
                         See what a good time we can have 
                         when you're forced to behave yourself.

                                     HENRY
                         Nikki, what you don't know about 
                         making love would populate the whole 
                         interior of Australia.

                                     NIKKI
                         I'll learn. When I'm good and ready.
                              (giggling)
                         They say it comes naturally.

                                     HENRY
                         Untie me now?

                                     NIKKI
                         Not on your life.
                              (she kisses him again)
                         Admit it, Pat. This was a great idea. 
                         Look at you -- sitting talking to me 
                         like a civilized man instead of 
                         grabbing around like a throwback. 
                         Why, if you weren't tied up, I 
                         wouldn't have dared tell you how 
                         much I liked you...

                                     HENRY
                              (producing a cigarette)
                         Got a light?

                                     NIKKI
                              (automatically striking 
                              a match and lighting 
                              his cigarette)
                         You see, your trouble is you don't 
                         know anything about women. You have 
                         no -- no technique. What a woman 
                         likes is to --

               She stops and stares at Henry's hands, which are resting 
               quietly in his lap.

                                     HENRY
                         Among other things you don't know is 
                         how to tie a knot.
                              (he stands up and 
                              grins at her)
                         It's very likely because the only 
                         knots you have on your mind are 
                         marital ones. Good-night, Miss 
                         Nicholson.

               He goes out.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               INT. STOREROOM

               A faint light from the underground hallway comes through a 
               transom. Barnes enters. The electric blanket discarded by 
               Ken lies on a nearby packing case. It is plugged into the 
               electric light socket, hence no light in the room. Barnes 
               snaps on his flashlight and gets a bottle of whiskey out of 
               another case, opens it, and takes a long swig. He leans over 
               and plugs his flying suit into the other half of the double-
               socket shared by the electric blanket's plug. He takes another 
               drink and, sitting in the semi-dark, starts whistling "Ragtime 
               Cowboy Joe."

               Suddenly he stops whistling and laughs.

                                     BARNES
                              (self-mocking)
                         Whistling in the dark, aren't you, 
                         Barnes?..

               He lifts the whiskey bottle again, then sits staring toward 
               the ice-encased mummy.

                                     BARNES
                              (suddenly)
                         All right, let's ses what you look 
                         like, sonny boy ---

               He switches on his flashlight, and centers its beam on the 
               ice-block. As Ericson said, the ice is now almost transparent. 
               Through it, only partially distorted, can be seen an unearthly 
               horror. It has a bulbous head, a tiny suck-hole for a mouth, 
               multiple eyes, no ears. Its arms are extra-long, ending in 
               thorny clusters, rather than hands. It stares malevolently 
               through the ice.

               Barnes lets out a grunt of dismay, and turns the flashlight 
               away.

                                     BARNES
                         Whew!

               He drinks again, and then starts making himself comfortable. 
               He uses a bag of flour for a pillow, and prepares to stretch 
               out on the floor. Abruptly he shines the flashlight on the 
               ice again.

                                     BARNES
                              (angrily)
                         Quit staring at me!

               He sees the blanket lying on the nearby packing case. He 
               picks it up, and throws it over the ice-cake.

                                     BARNES
                         I could go nuts looking at you...

               He lies down, puts his head on the flour sack and taking a 
               magazine from his pocket prepares to read. The camera moves 
               to the electric blanket now covering the ice-cake, then 
               follows the electric connection down to the indicator affixed 
               to the cord. The indicator hand points to the "full on" 
               position.

               After a moment, the camera moves back to the floor beneath 
               the ice block. A slow dripping has commenced. The sounds of 
               the rising storm outside obscure the pit-pat of the drops 
               hitting the floor. A small puddle starts to form.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE PUDDLE

               It is now a large puddle, very large.

               The camera pans across the wet floor, and discovers the puddle 
               is close to Barnes' legs.

               CLOSE SHOT - BARNES

               He is having difficulty reading. His flashlight has started 
               to wane. He snaps it on and off, experimentally. The battery 
               is nearly dead. Barnes aims it at the printed page once more, 
               then decides it is useless for the time being. He snaps it 
               off, and stretches himself out more comfortably.

               A splinter of light from the hallway outside still illuminates 
               the scene.

               CLOSE SHOT OF PUDDLE

               It continues to grow. The howl of the storm outside does not 
               lessen.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               STAIRWELL OUTSIDE STOREROOM

               The form of a sled dog appears. It stands poised at the top 
               of the steps for an instant, pointing eagerly at the storeroom 
               window. It is joined by three or four more sled dogs. They 
               start to bark angrily, their snouts still aimed at the 
               storeroom window. They run down the stairwell and press their 
               muzzle against the storeroom door.

               INTERIOR STOREROOM CLOSE SHOT OF BARNES

               He is sleeping. The barking and eager whining of the dogs 
               can now be heard over the storm noises outside. The CAMERA 
               PANS down to Barnes' legs. The puddle has reached them, and, 
               as we look, they stir slightly, causing a little splatter of 
               water. Barnes abruptly sits up into the picture.

                                     BARNES
                              (staring into the 
                              darkness at his feet)
                         What the --

               At this moment, a moving shadow falls across his face. He 
               looks up quickly. An expression of pure terror appears on 
               his face. He screams eerily, springs to his feet, and jerks 
               out his revolver. He fires six times, then, still screaming, 
               jumps for the storeroom door, the cord from his flying suit 
               snapping out of the fixture and trailing behind him. He yanks 
               open the door and runs into the corridor.

               INT. CORRIDOR

               Barnes races down the corridor, yelling at the top of his 
               lungs!

                                     BARNES
                         It's alive! It's alive! It's alive!

               INT. MAIN CORRIDOR

               As Barnes appears, still yelling, doors have begun to pop 
               open. Captain Henry, pyjama-clad, gun in hand, comes running 
               out of his room and grabs Barnes.

               The other inmates, in various stages of undress, tumble out 
               into the hallway only minutes later. Barnes continues to 
               shriek incoherently.

                                     HENRY
                              (shaking Barnes)
                         Shut up! Cut it out!
                              (he slaps Barnes, who 
                              stops screaming, and 
                              stands sobbing with 
                              terror)
                         Now! What is it? What happened?

                                     BARNES
                              (almost in shock)
                         It -- it -- it came after me! It's 
                         alive, I tell you!

                                     HENRY
                              (sharply)
                         Did you fire those shots?

                                     BARNES
                              (staring past him)
                         I shot it -- six times -- it kept on 
                         coming at me.

                                     HENRY
                              (releasing Barnes and 
                              wheeling to Dykes, 
                              Ericson and MacAuliff)
                         Sounds like some joker's loose. Come 
                         on. Bring your guns.

               He starts for the storeroom, Eddie, Ken, and Mac following.

                                     CHAPMAN
                              (to Mrs. Chapman, 
                              indicating Barnes)
                         Esther, better give this lad a 
                         sedative. I'll be right back.

               He starts up the hall. Carrington appears in his doorway.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (joining Chapman)
                         Did I hear right? The boy said it 
                         was alive?

                                     CHAPMAN
                              (nodding)
                         Probably had a bad dream.

                              Carrington)
                         Wait for me, Arthur.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         You stay here, Nikki.
                              (he stops and faces 
                              the group in the 
                              corridor)
                         I'd appreciate it if you'd all wait 
                         in the living room until we can check 
                         this nightmare. Thanks.

               He continues down the corridor, Chapman following.

               INT. STOREROOM.

               Henry leads the way into the room. He snaps on a light, and 
               stands staring at the electric blanket in the puddle of water.

                                     HENRY
                              (blankly)
                         Gone --

                                     DYKES
                         Those double-domes! They stole it.

                                     ERICSON
                         No. The kid said it was alive! I 
                         knew it -- all the time I was here -- 
                         I could feel it!

                                     DYKES
                         Nuts! How'd it get out of the ice?

               For answer, Pat indicates the electric blanket.

                                     HENRY
                         Somebody threw a hot blanket on it.

                                     DYKES
                         I know who. Those six-year old 
                         Einsteins, that's who.

               Carrington and Chapman have appeared in the doorway.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         What did we do, Lieutenant?

                                     DYKES
                              (furiously)
                         Swiped the freak. Hustled it off 
                         somewhere to take it apart, that's 
                         what!

                                     CARRINGTON
                         I assure you, Lieutenant --

                                     CHAPMAN
                              (suddenly)
                         Sh-h. Listen!

               All heads are turned toward the open door. Over the whine of 
               the wind they hear a chorus of savage barking and growling.

                                     HENRY
                         The sled dogs --

                                     ERICSON
                         He's out there --

                                     CHAPMAN
                         They'll tear him to pieces!

               Abruptly, Carrington brushes through the group, and darts 
               out into the howling night. He is clad only in his pajamas 
               and bathrobe.

                                     DYKES
                         Doctor! Stop!

                                     CHAPMAN
                         Arthur -- are you mad!

               Henry curses under his breath and charges in pursuit. Locating 
               Carrington with his flashlight, he brings him down with a 
               flying tackle. Carrington struggles to escape Henry's grasp, 
               but Henry succeeds in leading him back into the storeroom.  
               The storm noises have made their exclamations inaudible.

                                     HENRY
                              (panting)
                         Mac -- get flying suits -- hurry --

               MacAuliff runs out.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (also winded)
                         If you please -- Captain -- you may 
                         release me now --

                                     HENRY
                              (doing so)
                         That was a pretty stupid move -- for 
                         a genius.

                                     DYKES
                         You'd have been frozen to death in 
                         five minutes!

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (apologetically)
                         Too much zeal, I'm afraid. Forgive 
                         me, gentlemen.

                                     CHAPMAN
                              (peering into the 
                              night)
                         Over there -- I see something!

                                     HENRY
                         Put out the light.

               Dykes snaps off the storeroom light. The four men gaze 
               intently into the dark night. Henry turns on his flashlight. 
               Skeely enters the storeroom.

                                     SKEELY
                              (excitedly)
                         Where is it? Is it really alive? Can 
                         it talk? Who else saw it beside 
                         Barnes? What are you doing? Is it 
                         out there? Speak to me, somebody!

                                     HENRY
                         Shut up.
                              (he listens and looks 
                              for another moment)
                         They're still barking.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (speaking through 
                              numb lips -- his 
                              voice shivery)
                         If only the dogs follow it. We'll 
                         never find it otherwise.

                                     SKEELY
                              (a howl of dismay)
                         Don't tell me you've lost it -- you 
                         bungling army boob. This is worse 
                         than Pearl Harbor!

               MacAuliff enters, carrying flight suits.

                                     MACAULIFF
                         Here you are, Pat.

                                     HENRY
                         Grab one, Eddie.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         May I have one, Captain?

                                     SKEELY
                         Me, too!

                                     HENRY
                              (dressing hurriedly)
                         Army personnel only.

                                     SKEELY
                              (through his teeth)
                         Wait till you see what I write about 
                         you! You'll shoot yourself!

                                     HENRY
                              (zipping his suit up)
                         Snap it up, boys.

               He grabs his flashlight, and runs out into the storm. 
               MacAuliff and Dykes follow a second later. Skeely, Carrington, 
               and Chapman remain staring after them.

               EXT. STOREHOUSE

               The army officers, leaning against the iron wind, grope their 
               way toward the barking dogs. Their flashlights are almost 
               useless in the snow flurries raised by the gale. They stop 
               and confer for a second, their words carrying no further 
               than the ear they are shouted into. Henry points with his 
               flashlight, and the trio alters course accordingly.

               Suddenly a flashlight beam picks up some moving forms. All 
               three flashlights center on the activity, but snow flurries 
               continue to intervene. Dimly, a struggle can be discerned.

               The officers move toward it. A sudden increase in the wind 
               knocks them down. They continue toward the barking and 
               struggling, crawling on their hands and knees.

               MEDIUM SHOT OF DOG PACK FROM HENRY'S POINT OF VIEW

               The dogs are tearing at a figure in their midst. A sheet of 
               flying snow blots out the scene. When it reappears, the figure 
               is gone.

               Henry, MacAuliff, and Dykes crawl into the scene. Two dogs 
               lie dead in the snow. A third is wounded so hideously that 
               Dykes shoots it.

               Henry signals his pals to pick up the dead dogs. They each 
               take one.

               Henry stops and examines the ground. He picks up two objects, 
               looks around, then starts back to the camp.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. DR. CARRINGTON'S LABORATORY

               It is crowded with nearly all the members of the expedition. 
               The scientists are ranged around Carrington's table. The 
               others stand behind him.

               Carrington is bent over the table. Captain Henry, MacAuliff 
               and Eddie are immediately around him.

               A bright beam of light is focused on the table center, hidden 
               from our eyes as we come on the scene.

               The crowd around the table is silent and tense, as at some 
               overwhelming dramatic performance.

               Nikki stands beside the doctor. She is dressed in pajamas 
               and a woolen robe. All the others in the laboratory are also 
               hastily dressed, some in bath robes and slippers, some in 
               sweaters and work pants.

               Skeely's large bulk is crowded behind Captain Henry, peering 
               over his shoulder.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (as he works)
                         Can you describe what you saw, 
                         Captain?

                                     HENRY
                              (quietly)
                         The dogs had him down, tearing at 
                         him.

                                     MACAULIFF
                         I saw him get up, with three dogs on 
                         his throat.

                                     HENRY
                         The cold's blinding. I couldn't make 
                         out the action. But when we got there 
                         two of the dogs were dead.

                                     EDDIE
                         They looked like they'd been through 
                         a chopper. Mince meat!

                                     HENRY
                         I found the hand under one of them. 
                         They must have torn it off.

                                     SKEELY
                         How could dogs tear off a hand?

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (softly)
                         This kind of a hand.

               He is bent over the object on the table, looking at it through 
               a powerful lens.

               TABLE TOP

               On it lies a hand and part of a forearm. The hand has ten 
               stringy looking fingers, twice the human length. They are 
               stiffened and resemble a slightly arced set of thin knives 
               more than fingers.

                                     OLSON
                         Sharp as razors, aren't they?

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (studying the knife 
                              fingers)
                         Yes -- a sort of chitinous substance.

                                     SKEELY
                              (tensely)
                         Speak English -- will you!

                                     CARRINGTON
                         Something between a beetle's back 
                         and a rose thorn.

                                     SKEELY
                         Thorn fingered, eh?

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (trying to bend one 
                              of them)
                         Amazingly strong.

                                     CHAPMAN
                         They may be frozen.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         I don't think so.

                                     SKEELY
                         Well, we know one fact about him. 
                         He's dead now.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         What is your opinion, Captain?

                                     HENRY
                         I don't know. He stayed alive in a 
                         block of ice for twenty-four hours.

                                     MACAULIFF
                         After I'd sunk a pick into his skull.

                                     HENRY
                         And he got up -- with twelve dogs on 
                         him.

                                     OLSON
                              (bending over the 
                              table)
                         That's blood on the arm, isn't it, 
                         Arthur?

                                     CARRINGTON
                         Yes -- but not his blood.

               Carrington has been working on the arm with a scalpel.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         There's no blood in the arm. No animal 
                         tissue. Have a look at this under 
                         the microscope, George.

               He hands a bit of material to Dr. Auerback, who adjusts it 
               under a microscope.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (his voice soft as he 
                              continues his 
                              examination)
                         I doubt very much if it is dead. I 
                         doubt if it can die -- as we 
                         understand dying.

                                     SKEELY
                         It's bound to freeze to death outside.

                                     EDDIE
                         It got along all right in a block of 
                         ice -- for twenty-four hours.

                              (from the microscope)
                         No arterial structure indicated, 
                         Arthur. No nerve endings visible. 
                         Porous, unconnected cellular growth.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         I imagined that.

                                     SKEELY
                         Sounds like you're trying to describe 
                         a vegetable, doctor.

                                     AUERBACK
                         I am.

                                     CARRINGTON

                              hand, his eye peering 
                              through his lens)
                         Are you getting all this, Nikki?

                                     NIKKI
                              (who has been writing 
                              in her pad)
                         Yes, doctor.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         That's why the bullets fired into it 
                         by Corporal Barnes had no effect. 
                         They merely punched a few holes into 
                         some vegetable matter.

                         What about the green stuff I saw 
                         ooze out of its head?

                                     CARRINGTON
                         There is some of it in the hand. I 
                         think we will find it has a sugar 
                         base.

                                     HENRY
                         Like -- plant sap?

                                     CARRINGTON
                         Yes.

                                     SKEELY
                              (excitedly)
                         You mean -- its some kind of a super 
                         carrot, doctor?

                                     CARRINGTON
                         A carrot that can construct a ship 
                         beyond our terrestrial intelligence, 
                         of materials we have not yet created -- 
                         and guide it sixty million miles or 
                         more through space.

                                     MACAULIFF
                         But you don't think it has any 
                         feelings, eh?

                                     CARRINGTON
                         It has an intelligence beyond ours -- 
                         and possibly feelings equally refined.

                                     HENRY
                              (softly)
                         Vegetable with a brain --

                                     SKEELY
                         An intellectual carrot! The mind 
                         boggles!

                                     CARRINGTON
                         It shouldn't. Imagine how strange it 
                         would have seemed in the pliocene 
                         age to forecast that worms, fish, 
                         and lizards that crawled over the 
                         earth were going to evolve -- into 
                         us. On the planet from which our 
                         visitor came, vegetable life underwent 
                         an evolution similar to that of our 
                         own animal life, which would explain 
                         the superiority of its brain. Its 
                         development was not handicapped by 
                         emotional or sexual factors.

                                     SKEELY
                         Dr. Carrington, you're a man who's 
                         won the Nobel prize. You've received 
                         every kind of international kudos a 
                         scientist can attain. If you were 
                         for sale I could get a million bucks 
                         for you from any foreign government. 
                         I am not, therefor, I going to stick 
                         my neck out and say that you are 
                         stuffed absolutely clean full of 
                         wild blueberry muffins, but I promise 
                         you that my readers are going to 
                         think so.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (smiling)
                         Not for long, Mr. Skeely. In fact, 
                         not even for a moment if they happen 
                         to know anything about the flora of 
                         their own planet.

                                     SKEELY
                         You mean there are vegetables right 
                         here on earth that -- that can think?

                                     CARRINGTON
                         A certain kind of thinking, yes. Did 
                         you ever hear of the Telegraph Vine?  
                         Or the Acanthus Century Plant?

                                     SKEELY
                         Not recently.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         The Century plant catches mice, bats, 
                         squirrels -- any mammals small enough 
                         to evade its privacy. It lures them 
                         with a bait of sweet syrup then it 
                         closes like a fist and feeds on the 
                         corpse of its catch. It is only a 
                         plant but its brain can obviously 
                         outwit a species far above it in the 
                         scale of minds as we measure them.

                                     SKEELY
                              (scribbling)
                         Thanks, doctor. And what's a Telegraph 
                         Vine?

                                     CARRINGTON
                         A vine that has proven beyond doubt 
                         that it can signal to other vines of 
                         its species twenty or one hundred 
                         miles away. If an insect migration, 
                         for instance, is moving in a certain 
                         direction, it will devour the first 
                         vine but the second one, having been 
                         warned, will have altered its chemical 
                         structure so that the insects find 
                         it inedible.

                                     SKEELY
                              (still scribbling)
                         That's one for Ripley.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (smiling)
                         There are hundreds of other examples. 
                         No, Mr. Skeely, intelligence in 
                         vegetable and plants is an old story 
                         on this planet of ours. Older even 
                         than the animal arrogance that has 
                         overlooked it.

                         The absence of ears of the creature

                         It probably neither hears nor sees 
                         as we do -- but receives magnetic 
                         impressions.

                         We can safely presume that the planet 
                         on which it lived is colder than 
                         ours and that its atmosphere is too

                         It's amazing how it was able to adjust 
                         itself to the vitally altered 
                         conditions of earth -- and stay alive.

                         for it to stay out in that storm if 
                         it can move. And I saw it move.

                                     VOORHEES
                         It ran out into the cold. I think 
                         our surmise that it requires a cold 
                         temperature is correct.

                                     LAURENZ
                         Obviously. That's why the saucer 
                         tried to land in our Polar regions. 
                         They corresponded to the conditions 
                         of its own planet.

                                     HENRY
                         There might be another reason. Its 
                         passengers could have wanted to keep 
                         their arrival secret.

                                     EDDIE
                         What's on your mind, Pat?

                                     HENRY
                         I have an idea it's inside the camp. 
                         It headed into the storm because it 
                         smelled the dogs and was hungry.

                                     SKEELY
                              (staring)
                         Inside the camp! Gentlemen -- what I 
                         would give for an interview!

                                     CARRINGTON
                         I don't think it eats, Captain. There 
                         is no evidence of any animal digestive 
                         system.

                                     HENRY
                         If it doesn't eat, it does something.
                              (to the group)
                         I'd like a half dozen men to go along 
                         with Lt. Dykes and me. We don't need 
                         guns. Knives, clubs and axes will be 
                         better.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         I grant you it may have returned to 
                         the camp -- and hid itself on the 
                         premises, Captain. But there's no 
                         reason to go after it -- like an 
                         enemy.

                                     HENRY
                         It didn't look friendly -- in the 
                         snow outside, doctor.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (softly)
                         It's a stranger in a strange land -- 
                         with strange -- unearthly features 
                         and attributes. The only crimes 
                         involved are those that man and nature 
                         have committed against it. It crashed 
                         in an air ship, was frozen in the 
                         ice, had its head split open by a 
                         pick, and was attacked by a pack of 
                         fierce dogs. I see no reason to give 
                         it a bad character, Captain.

                                     HENRY
                              (grimly)
                         It went after the dogs. I'm in charge 
                         of the search, doctor. And I'm going 
                         to look for it, my way.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (his voice rising)
                         It would be criminal vandalism to 
                         injure the visitor further. We must 
                         find it -- and treat it as our 
                         superior whose brain -- if we can 
                         communicate with it -- is full of 
                         unique and overwhelming knowledge. 
                         We must --
                              (he breaks off and 
                              stares at the table)

                                     SKEELY
                              (his eyes on the table)
                         Holy Heaven! It's moving!

                                     EDDIE
                         It's alive -- look out!

               We see the hand moving on the table. Its knife fingers flex 
               and unflex. The sliced palm tightens into a fist and opens 
               again. Some of the watchers step away from the table, a terror 
               in them. Carrington remains bent over the hand. Captain Henry 
               stays beside him.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (softly, as the hand 
                              moves)
                         Nikki --

                                     NIKKI
                              (faintly)
                         Yes, Doctor --

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (dictating)
                         At two forty-five the hand became 
                         alive. The temperature of the forearm 
                         showed a twenty degrees rise.

               He is studying a thermometer removed from the arm as he 
               dictates. There is a hush. The only sound is that made by 
               the knife fingers beating on the table. During the hush, 
               Carrington takes the surgical scalpel and cuts his thumb.  
               He holds the bleeding thumb over the moving hand. His blood 
               drops on the forearm. The hand's activity is increased. Its 
               fingers move more quickly as they beat on the table top.  
               Carrington continues his dictating.

               I believe the activity due to the fact that the organism 
               when it's temperature rose was able to ingest the nourishment 
               provided by the canine blood with which it was covered...

               CORRIDOR LEADING FROM KITCHEN

               Six or seven supply rooms open on this corridor. A searching 
               party led by Captain Henry is in the process of examining 
               these rooms.

               Henry carries a Geiger counter with which he scans each door 
               before opening it and sweeping it with his flashlight.

               Carrington, MacAuliff, Dykes, Laurenz, Voorhees, Stone and 
               Chapman comprise the rest of the searching party. With the 
               exception of Carrington and Skeely, who are unarmed, they 
               carry an assortment of ice-axes, iron rods, shovels and other 
               improvised weapons. Skeely carries a camera.

                                     STONE
                              (as Henry searches)
                         You sure you know how to use that 
                         camera, Skeely?

                                     SKEELY
                         I ran one of these things on Iwo 
                         Jima. Never got out of focus once, 
                         during the entire bombardment.
                              (he calls)
                         Hey, Captain --

                                     HENRY
                         What do you want?

                                     SKEELY
                         If we catch up with our pal I want a 
                         couple of hundred feet of film... 
                         before anyone starts making a salad 
                         out of him.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (a touch sharply)
                         No one has any intention of injuring 
                         him, Mr. Skeely.

                                     CHAPMAN
                         And no chance of finding him I'd 
                         say. He'd never hide in the camp -- 
                         not after the reception Barnes gave 
                         him.

               Henry has completed his inspection of the supply rooms.

                                     HENRY
                         No dice in this end. Come on.

               He leads the way.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INTERIOR RADIO ROOM

               A short corridor leads to a windowless chamber that houses 
               ths camp's generators. The party with Henry and his Geiger 
               counter in the van, crosses the radio room.

               Hendrix looks up from his telegraphy.

                                     HENDRIX
                         Looks like a lynching bee. What's 
                         up?

                                     MACAULIFF
                              (kidding)
                         We heard you got the Mars man hidden 
                         back there.

                                     HENDRIX
                              (in alarm)
                         What! You mean it's -- it's --

                                     CHAPMAN
                         Mr. MacAuliff is being amusing.

                                     HENDRIX
                         I don't want any part of that thing. 
                         In fact, I'd like to go home.

               INTERIOR GENERATING ROOM

               Henry's flashlight probes its corners.

                                     HENRY'S VOICE
                         Nothing.

               As he closes the door.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               SHADOWY HALLWAY

               The party moves along. As it reaches a doorway, Henry's geiger 
               counter begins to click.

                                     HENRY
                         Hold it!

               He moves toward the doorway. The clicking of the counter 
               increases.

                                     HENRY
                         It's in there! Eddie -- Mac --

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (with a small chuckle)
                         No, Captain. That's the mineralogy 
                         lab. We've got radioactive isotopes 
                         in there.

                                     CHAPMAN
                         Your Geigers reacting to a roomful 
                         of uranium ore samples.

                                     HENRY
                         Let's check it anyway.

               Dykes and MacAuliff stand beside him as he pushes open the 
               door and snaps on the light.

               INTERIOR MINERALOGY LAB

               Save for the scientific paraphenalia that clutters it, it is 
               empty. Henry switches off the light.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INTERIOR END OF CORRIDOR

               The party has halted by a closed door at the end of the 
               hallway.

                                     HENRY
                              (trying the door)
                         It's locked.

                                     CHAPMAN
                         I'm sorry -- I forgot. I'll get the 
                         key.

               He hurries away.

                                     HENRY
                         Nothing else was locked up. What's 
                         in here?

                                     CARRINGTON
                         The greenhouse. We have to keep it 
                         locked. The Eskimos have a weakness 
                         for our strawberries.

                                     SKEELY
                              (incredulously)
                         Your what?

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (smiling)
                         Strawberries.

                                     VOORHEES
                         We use artificial sunlight. It's 
                         quite a garden. We raise our own 
                         tomatoes, asparagus, lettuce.

                                     DYKES
                              (sharply)
                         Shut up a minute!

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (quietly)
                         What is it?

                                     DYKES
                              (his ear at the door)
                         There's something moving inside.

               There is a silence as everyone listens intently. Carrington 
               puts his ear to the door.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (disappointed)
                         Yes, I hear it. It's the ventilator. 
                         The fan needs oiling.

               The group relaxes.

                                     SKEELY
                              (bitterly)
                         We've been through every crevice of 
                         the camp. If it's not in there, we're 
                         cooked. Just think -- we've lost a 
                         flying saucer and a man from Mars 
                         all in one day. What a bunch of 
                         butterfingers!

               Chapman enters.

                                     CHAPMAN
                              (proffering the key)
                         Here you are, Captain.

               Henry takes the key and opens the door.

                                     SKEELY
                              (ruminatively, as 
                              Henry is opening the 
                              door)
                         I wonder what they would have done 
                         to Columbus if he'd discovered 
                         America, and then lost it.

               Henry opens the door slowly. He aims his flashlight and snaps 
               it on.

               INT. GREENHOUSE

               Henry's flashlight illumines the greenhouse for several 
               moments, playing over its plants and bushes. Henry switches 
               on the artificial sunlight arcs. A queer glow suffuses the 
               greenery. Henry enters, the others follow.

               They stand staring into the corners of the large room. It is 
               empty and silent.

                                     CHAPMAN
                         It's empty.

                                     HENRY
                         Maybe.

               He starts forward to examine the spaces concealed by the 
               shrubbery. Skeely and Carrington move with him.

                                     HENRY
                              (stopping)
                         Stay here, please. Near the door.

                                     SKEELY
                         My, you're big and brave. What are 
                         you going to do, catch him all alone?

                                     HENRY
                         I'm still waiting to see if he wants 
                         to catch me. Eddie -- Mac -- come 
                         along.

               The soldier trio makes a round of the hothouse. The others 
               wait.

               CLOSE SHOT OF CARRINGTON

               He is watching the moving flyers. Suddenly he sees something 
               that brings a glint of excitement to his eye. He starts to 
               speak, then reconsiders and changes the incipient remark 
               into a cough.

               MEDIUM SHOT GROUP AT DOOR

                                     VOORHEES
                              (closest to Carrington)
                         What's that, Arthur?

                                     CARRINGTON
                         Nothing. I just noticed. The Mendelson 
                         molds are vitiated. We mustn't neglect 
                         them.

               Voorhees and Laurenz look at Carrington curiously. He shakes 
               his head imperceptibly. They refrain from comment.

               Henry and his colleagues complete their round of the 
               greenhouse.

                                     HENRY
                         Well, that's it, I guess.

                                     SKEELY
                         Yes, and isn't it dandy. We're 
                         certainly going to be a famous group. 
                         Like the Donner Party.

                                     HENRY
                              (ignoring him)
                         Dr. Chapman was right. Our pal is 
                         probably holed up in a snowbank.

                                     CHAPMAN
                              (nodding)
                         After all, he's lost a hand and had 
                         six bullet holes shot in him. Animal, 
                         vegetable or mineral, he must need a 
                         rest.

               The others laugh. Their mood is much lighter now, except for 
               Skeely, who stares morosely at the floor.

                                     HENRY
                         We'll start searching outside as 
                         soon as it's light.

                                     CHAPMAN
                         We'd better do it in relays. A half 
                         hour is about all you can stand in 
                         that cold now.

                                     HENRY
                         Good idea. Report to Lt. Dykes and 
                         he'll arrange a scedule for you.
                              (He reaches for the 
                              light switch)
                         Coming, gentlemen?

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (smoothly)
                         Not right away, Captain. Doctor 
                         Voorhees and Professor Laurenz and I 
                         want to do some emergency work on 
                         those molds. Goodnight, gentlemen.

               There is a chorus of goodnights as the others move out. Henry 
               stands looking at Carrington for a moment.

                                     HENRY
                         Kind of late to start work now, isn't 
                         it?

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (laughing)
                         It's easy to see you're no scientist, 
                         Captain Henry. Work is what we do 
                         when we want to relax.

               Henry continues to study him for another moment.

                                     HENRY
                              (abruptly)
                         I see. Goodnight.

               He goes out. Carrington quickly closes the door behind him.

               He bolts it. Laurenz and Voorhees watch him expectantly. 
               Carrington turns and smiles at them brightly.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         The MacCormick molds -- look!

               He points. Laurenz and Voorhees regard the plants he 
               indicates.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         They're wilted, from cold.

                                     LAURENZ
                         But it's warm in here.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (grinning happily)
                         Isn't it? So what do you conclude?
                              (without waiting for 
                              an answer he continues)
                         Those molds would be in the direct 
                         path of a blast of icy air if that 
                         rear door were opened. Ten or twenty 
                         seconds of such an exposure, and 
                         they would wilt. I repeat, gentlemen, 
                         what do you conclude?

                                     VOORHEES
                              (pointing)
                         But that bolt hasn't been pulled. 
                         How could the door be opened?

               For answer Carrington strides to the rear door. Leaving the 
               bolt still in "Shot" position, he turns the knob and pulls. 
               The door opens.

               Voorhees and Laurenz move quickly to the door. The wind 
               whistles about them as the three scientists examine the bolt.

               INSERT - CLOSEUP OF BOLT

               It has been cleanly severed.

                                     VOORHEES' VOICE
                         Filed clean through!

               BACK TO GROUP. Carrington closes the door.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (as he does so)
                         Not filed, Andrew. Cut.

                                     LAURENZ
                              (excited)
                         Yes. Of course. Those razor-like 
                         fingers on the hand!

                                     VOORHEES
                         But the power -- to cut through that 
                         steel -- like butter --

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (smiling happily)
                         Incredible. Really incredible.

                                     LAURENZ
                              (his eyes darting 
                              around the greenhouse)
                         Then it's been in here.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (also scanning his 
                              surroundings)
                         Beyond a doubt.

                                     VOORHEES
                         What's that?

                                     LAURENZ
                         Where?

                                     VOORHEES
                         Stand here. See?
                              (he points)
                         The storage bin. See how the light 
                         glistens on it.

               Carrington crosses to a two and a half foot storage bin, and 
               stares at it.

               CLOSE SHOT - STORAGE BIN

               Its handle glistens strangely.

               BACK TO GROUP

               Carrington touches the handle with his forefinger. It is 
               coated with a viscous fluid. Carrington rubs it between his 
               thumb and forefinger, then smells it.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         A smear of sap -- from the wounded 
                         arm.
                              (indicating the bin)
                         Pull it down, please.

               Laurenz and Voorhees take hold of the bin and start to lift 
               it to the floor. It falls from their grasp.

                                     VOORHEES
                         Look out!

               The bin crashes over on its side. A body topples out of it 
               and crashes at their feat. It is the corpse of a dog.

               Carrington kneels down and examines it.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (feeling the dog)
                         Not dead over an hour.
                              (to Voorhees)
                         See if there's any congealed blood 
                         in the bin, Andrew.

                                     LAURENZ
                              (as Voorhees inspects 
                              the bin)
                         Seems rather shrunken, doesn't it?

                                     CARRINGTON
                         Its blood has been drained.

                                     VOORHEES
                         The bin is clean.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (nodding)
                         Now we know definitely the type of 
                         nourishment it requires.

                                     LAURENZ
                              (gesturing at the 
                              dead dog)
                         Why do you suppose it brought the 
                         dog in here?

                                     CARRINGTON
                         We must try very hard to find an 
                         answer to that question.

               His eyes start moving around the greenhouse.

                                     VOORHEES
                         Maybe the artificial sunlight 
                         attracted --

                              (shaking his head)
                         The light was off.

                              (tensely)
                         That loam bed -- number four. Does 
                         it strike you the earth has been 
                         disturbed?

                         Olson started some lichen there last 
                         week.

                         That's right.

               The trio moves over to the loam bed. Carrington regards the 
               loose earth.

                         Gentlemen, our creature will come 
                         back here. Of that I am certain.

                         What do you see, Arthur?

                                     CARRINGTON
                         I'd rather not say -- yet. But it 
                         will come back.

                         Hadn't we better tell the others?

                                     CARRINGTON
                         No. I think it better if Science, 
                         rather than the Army greeted it this 
                         time.
                              (to Laurenz)
                         Will you keep watch with me tonight, 
                         Andrews?

                         Please bring us some sandwiches and 
                         coffee. Tell Doctor Auerback and 
                         Doctor Olson what we have found. Ask 
                         them to relieve us at eight in the 
                         morning. And ask them, please to 
                         confide in no one.

               INT. MAIN ROOM. CAMP

               It is eleven-thirty the following morning. A late breakfast 
               is being served in the main living room.

               Outside the storm has not abated. It fills the sky, darkening 
               the arctic noon.

               Henry and Dykes are eating. Mrs. Chapman sits nearby knitting.

                                     DYKES
                              (staring out the window)
                         Look at that, will you? It'll never 
                         let up! And we could have been in 
                         Edmonton -- open air cafes. Moonlit 
                         gardens --

                                     MRS. CHAPMAN
                              (placidly)
                         Oh, we've had them worse than this. 
                         Three weeks is the longest they last.

                                     DYKES
                         Three weeks! We ought to be growing 
                         our own fur by that time.

               The door opens and MacAuliff, Barnes and Ericson come in.

                                     HENRY
                         Anything, Mac?

                              garments)
                         Not a sign. We've poked into every 
                         snowbank within a mile.

                         Barnes flushed a Polar bear.

                              (bitterly)
                         I sure did!

                         Not after I saw it was only a bear.

               Hendrix enters from an interior door. He carries a sheaf of 
               messages.

                              (bitterly)
                         I want a raise. Or I'm gonna strike. 
                         Sixteen hours straight receiving 
                         without stopping!

                              (angrily)
                         Just a few million words. What's the 
                         matter with that Fogarty fellow -- 
                         got epilepsy?
                              (he tosses a bundle 
                              of messages on the 
                              table)
                         I haven't even had time to eat.

               He pours himself a cup of coffee. Dykes picks up the messages.

                         Some of them are for Skeely.

                         Skip them. Stick to Fogarty.

                         I get the general drift. He wants to 
                         hear from me.

               Skeely enters. He is rumpled, unshaved and still sleepy.

                         You can't go to bed. Listen -- I'll 
                         split with you. It's a bonanza! I'll 
                         give you 25 percent of the take.

                              wearily)
                         Nothing doing! I'm out on my feet. 
                         And the stuff ain't going through 
                         anyway. Waste motion.

                         Ez, old man, they're mobbing the 
                         newspaper offices. They're hanging 
                         out of windows. This is a world 
                         emergency. You can't desert your 
                         post in an emergency -- any more 
                         than you would if a ship was sinking?

                              (starting to open the 
                              door, his back turned 
                              to it)
                         A ship is sinking! And it's me.

               As he pulls the door open, we see a tall figure leanings 
               against it. Hendrix, unaware of it, continues to open the 
               door as he talks.

                                     HENDRIX
                         I wouldn't stay up another hour for 
                         ten thousand dollars a minute. I'm 
                         out on my feet, I tell you.

               The tall figure slides in the doorway and comes crashing 
               into the room at Hendrix' feet. It is Algari, the botanist. 
               His face is covered with blood. He is semi-conscious. Henry 
               and Dykes rush to him. Henry grabs his wrist and feels for 
               his pulse.

                                     SKEELY
                         Who -- Who's that?

                         Dr. Algari.
                              (to Henry)
                         Is he -- dead?

                                     HENRY
                         No.
                              (to Barnes)
                         Get Dr. Chapman.
                              (to Mrs. Chapman)
                         Got any smelling salts?

                                     MRS. CHAPMAN
                         Right here -- in the washroom.

               She starts out of the room.

                                     HENRY
                         Wait.
                              (to MacAuliff)
                         Go with her, Mac.

               MacAuliff follows her out. Algari stirs and tries to sit up.

                                     HENRY
                         Take it easy, Doctor. Stay where you 
                         are. Can you talk?

                                     ALGARI
                              (with difficulty)
                         In the greenhouse -- the thing -- 
                         Dr. Olson -- Auerback.

                                     HENRY
                         What happened?

                                     ALGARI
                         I went in -- to check the temperature -- 
                         my back was turned -- when Olson 
                         screamed -- When I turned around -- 
                         the thing -- it cut my face -- The 
                         blood blinded me -- I fell down -- I 
                         must have fainted.
                              (Mrs. Chapman 
                              reappears. She hands 
                              Henry the salts. He 
                              holds them to Algari's 
                              nostrils)
                         Thank you... When I came to, I saw 
                         Olson and Auerback -- hanging upside 
                         down -- Their throats were cut -- I 
                         crawled out -- and came here --

               Henry rises swiftly.

                                     HENRY
                         Come on, Eddie. You too, Mac. The 
                         rest of you stay here -- and stay 
                         together.

               He runs out.

                                     SKEELY
                         I'm coming! I don't care what you 
                         say!

               He follows the others.

               OUTSIDE GREENHOUSE DOOR.

               The door is shut. Henry, MacAuliff, Dykes and Skeely come 
               down the corridor. They are carrying axes and guns.

               Henry approaches the door, then stops. He turns to MacAuliff.

                                     HENRY
                         Mac, round up a detail and post it 
                         at the rear door of this hothouse. 
                         Don't go in -- just take some timber 
                         and seal up the doorway!

                                     MACAULIFF
                         Right.

               He runs down the hall. Almost before Henry has finished 
               speaking, the door behind him has opened with lightning 
               rapidity. Henry turns with almost equal speed, instantly 
               raising his axe. The Thing appears for a split second in the 
               doorway, only to be met with a crashing wallop from the flat 
               of Henry's axe. The force of the blow propels the Thing back 
               into the greenhouse. Henry seizes the doorknob and pulls the 
               door shut. He turns the key in the lock.

                                     HENRY
                              (to Dykes)
                         Get the carpenter -- on the double!

               Dykes runs out.

                                     SKEELY
                              (tensely)
                         We going in now?

                                     HENRY
                         No.

                                     SKEELY
                         What about Olson and Auerback?

                                     HENRY
                              (snapping)
                         Nothing about them! They're dead.

                                     SKEELY
                              (producing a camera 
                              from his pocket)
                         How about opening the door long enough 
                         for me to get one shot -- just two 
                         seconds.

                                     HENRY
                         I'll shoot the man who opens this 
                         door.

                                     SKEELY
                              (grimacing)
                         Well, that's a straight answers. 
                         What other plans have you got?

                                     HENRY
                         If Mac gets to the rear door in time, 
                         we're going to keep that thing bottled 
                         up in there.

                                     SKEELY
                         Suppose it starves?

                                     HENRY
                         I'll let you do my crying for me.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               MEDIUM SHOT AT DOOR OF GREENHOUSE

               The carpenter is driving home spikes in a heavy cross beam 
               that bars the greenhouse door. Four similar bars have already 
               been installed.

               Barnes and Ericson are holding the beam in position as the 
               carpenter works. Skeely has left to resume his pestering of 
               Hendrix the telegrapher.

               Henry is consulting with Chapman.

                                     HENRY
                         You're sure there's no other way 
                         out? No trapdoor -- or windows?

                                     CHAPMAN
                         None. Only the front and back doors.

                                     HENRY
                         The walls solid?

                                     CHAPMAN
                         Corrugated iron.

                                     HENRY
                         That thing's radio active. Could it 
                         maybe burn its way out?

                                     CHAPMAN
                         I'd consider it extremely unlikely, 
                         but --

               He pauses.

                                     HENRY
                         But what?

                                     CHAPMAN
                         The thing itself is extremely 
                         unlikely. According to Doctor Algari, 
                         it has already grown back its arm.
                              (with a sudden emotion)
                         Captain Henry -- forgive me. I don't 
                         want to go against your orders but 
                         those two men in there were friends 
                         of mine. Close friends, for many 
                         years. Isn't there some way we can 
                         get their bodies out? I can't stand 
                         the thought of them hanging there -- 
                         by their feet -- and nothing being 
                         done for them!

                                     HENRY
                         What can be done for them? Face the 
                         facts, Doctor. They're dead. Their 
                         throats were cut and they bled to 
                         death. Upside down, like in a 
                         slaughter house. Our job is to see 
                         that nobody else joins them.

                                     CHAPMAN
                              (with a shudder)
                         What a way to die.

               Professor Voorhees has come down the corridor.

                                     VOORHEES
                              (quietly to Chapman)
                         May I have a word with you, Fred?

                                     CHAPMAN
                              (turning to him)
                         Certainly.

                                     VOORHEES
                         Privately.

                                     CHAPMAN
                         Oh.
                              (to Henry)
                         Excuse me.

               Henry nods. Chapman accompanies Voorhees a few yards down 
               the corridor. Voorhees starts to whisper. Henry watches them.

                                     VOORHEES
                              (into Chapman's ear)
                         Come to Carrington's lab as soon as 
                         you can -- and don't let anyone know.

                                     CHAPMAN
                         Right away.
                              (turning back to Henry)
                         Was there anything else, Captain?

                                     HENRY
                         Yes. We're keeping a double guard -- 
                         outside and in. Two hour shifts. 
                         I'll need eight volunteers.

               INT. DR. CARRINGTON'S LABORATORY

               Dr. Carrington is at his desk. Nikki is beside him, note 
               book in hand.

               Drs. Chapman, Voorhees, Laurenz and Wilson are in front of 
               him. They are silent and alert as he talks.

               Carrington is tense and queerly exuberant. Exhaustion and 
               excitement are in his face.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (softly and tensely)
                         Two of our colleagues have died and 
                         a third is dying. Those are our losses -- 
                         and the battle has only begun. There 
                         will be more losses. The creature X 
                         is more powerful, more intelligent 
                         than us. We are infants beside him. 
                         He regards us as soft, vulnerable 
                         earth worms important only for his 
                         nourishment. He has the same attitude 
                         toward us as we have toward a field 
                         of cabbages.

                                     LAURENZ
                              (interrupting)
                         You said you had news for us, Arthur.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         I have.
                              (he rises and smiles)
                         We are infants, earthworms and also 
                         scientists. We have made gains.

                                     VOORHEES
                         What have you found out?

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (glowing and tense)
                         A new world has come to devour us. 
                         Only science can conquer it. Our 
                         minds, gentlemen -- the little muscle 
                         that thinks, observes, examines and 
                         finds answers. All other weapons 
                         will be powerless.
                              (his eyes close.  
                              Weariness overcomes 
                              him.  He mutters)
                         I'm very tired. It's difficult to 
                         eat.
                              (he presses his thumbs 
                              into his eyeballs)
                         Will you read my notes, Miss 
                         Nicholson?

                                     LAURENZ
                         You need some rest, Arthur.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (softly)
                         No rest. Please read --

                                     NIKKI
                              (reading from her 
                              note book)
                         At 9 p.m. I placed the fifteen seeds 
                         taken from the severed hand of X in 
                         four inches of earth. I saturated 
                         the earth with two units of plasma 
                         taken from our blood bank.

               Nikki pauses, her face tense.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         Please go on, Nikki.

                                     NIKKI
                              (continuing to read)
                         The condition of the dog found in 
                         the greenhouse indicated that blood 
                         was a primal factor in the cultivation 
                         of the seeds. At 2 a.m. the first 
                         sprouts appeared through the soil. I 
                         used another two units of plasma. At 
                         4 a.m. the sprouts began to take on

               She breaks off, her face strained, her voice faint.

                         They are still growing!

                         Five of them -- have survived.

               Carrington rises and starts toward a screened in table. The 
               others follow. Nikki remains motionless at the desk.

               SCREENED IN TABLE

               A four foot box of earth is on its top. The men stand over 
               it. Five small sprouts are budding through the soil. There 
               is a moment of silence.

                                     CHAPMAN

                         It reproduces itself -- like a 
                         vegetable!

                         Yes. The Geiger counter registered 6 
                         point 1 radio activity from them an 
                         hour ago.

               He holds the counter over the sprouts. The men watch its 
               dial.

                         We must nourish them carefully. My 
                         examination of the hand revealed a 
                         high glucose content and a chlorophyll 
                         base. I suggest a glucose injection.

                                     LAURENZ
                         Glucose may be dangerous.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         Yes. I think so. He's not using 
                         glucose in the greenhouse.

                                     WILSON
                         That's why he killed -- for blood. 
                         He's growing seeds there. What will 
                         we do -- when these mature?

                                     CARRINGTON
                         Study them.

                         There are no roots.

                         Amazing! I think we ought to turn 
                         the violet rays on it.

                         No. The growth seems strongest where 
                         the earth is dampest. Any light might 
                         dry it up.

                         The sound doesn't come from any

                         else.

               Wilson puts the stethoscope in his ears and holds the end of

               Nikki has appeared behind the screen.

                         just to visit the earth, but to 
                         conquer it! To start growing some 
                         kind of a horrible army. And turn 
                         the human race into -- into food for 
                         it! And kill the whole world.

                         Atmospheric changes. A sudden cooling

               She is typing at her desk, her note book propped up in front 
               of her. A sheaf of typewritten pages is beside her machine.

               The door opens. Captain Henry enters.

                         I'll rub your neck. It'll relax you.

               He comes behind her and massages her neck and shoulders 
               gently.

                         Please, I can't concentrate -- when 
                         you do that.

                         Maybe you're concentrating on the 
                         wrong thing.

               She finishes the last line of typing, pulls the page out of 
               the machine, puts it on a pile of copy. She covers the pile 
               with a large book.

                                     NIKKI
                         I'm bushed.

                         That feels good. Please don't tire 
                         yourself.

                                     HENRY
                              (massaging, and trying 
                              to get a look at the 
                              copy over her head)
                         Couldn't.
                              (casually)
                         Have there been any accidents up 
                         here in the last two months? Anybody 
                         shot, stabbed or had an ulcer removed?

                                     NIKKI
                              (covering the copy 
                              casually with another 
                              book)
                         No. That what-is-it in the greenhouse 
                         is our first diversion.

                                     HENRY
                              (smiling)
                         I brought up thirty-five units of 
                         blood plasma two months ago. What's 
                         become of it?

                                     NIKKI
                         Why nothing. It's here.

                                     HENRY
                         I wondered why they're not using it 
                         on Dr. Algari. They're giving him 
                         blood transfusions. No plasma. Two 
                         live donors. Any ideas about that?

                                     NIKKI
                              (moving her neck and 
                              shoulders away)
                         Thanks for the massage. You're really 
                         very good at it.

                                     HENRY
                         It's just a sample.
                              (firmly)
                         Relax your neck muscles.
                              (she does)
                         That's fine.
                              (he starts massaging 
                              her shoulders, 
                              speaking casually as 
                              he does)
                         What's Carrington doing with thirty-
                         five units of plasma, Nikki?

                                     NIKKI
                         Ask him.

                                     HENRY
                         I will.
                              (gently)
                         Just close your eyes -- and float.  
                         It's good for you.

                                     NIKKI
                              (wearily)
                         I'm really exhausted.

               She closes her eyes, sighs and "floats." Henry makes a quiet 
               sudden move toward the pile of copy she has hidden under the 
               two books. The gesture catches Nikki by surprise. She stares 
               for an instant unable to believe his perfidy and then leaps 
               to her feet, full of outrage.

                                     NIKKI
                         Give that back! It's private. You're 
                         not allowed to -- ! Give that back 
                         or I'll -- ! Oh, you're horrible, a 
                         cheap, underhanded army spy!

               She has flung herself at him, clawing for the papers in his 
               hand. Her physical assault is too violent for Henry to ignore. 
               He puts an end to it by sending a short right into her 
               stomach. She doubles up with a groan.

                                     NIKKI
                         You hit me!

                                     HENRY
                         Only in the stomach. Won't leave any 
                         marks.
                              (Nikki sinks into her 
                              chair, staring at 
                              him as he reads the 
                              copy. His voice grows 
                              quiet and serious)
                         So that's it! Holy Ike -- five of 
                         them!
                              (he looks up from his 
                              reading and stares 
                              back at her, his 
                              voice curt)
                         You deserved that punch!

                                     NIKKI
                              (softly)
                         I wanted to tell you. But I couldn't. 
                         I gave my word. I'm glad you -- did 
                         what you did. I'm very glad.
                              (she smiles wearily 
                              at him)
                         You can finish the massage now -- 
                         Pat.

                                     HENRY
                         I've got a few other things to finish 
                         first, baby.

               He walks out.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. CARRINGTON'S LABORATORY

               The door opens. Captain Henry, Lt. Dykes, Dr. Redding and 
               Dr. Ambrose enter. They look into a seemingly empty room.

                                     HENRY
                              (calling)
                         Dr. Carrington.
                              (Carrington comes out 
                              from behind the screen)

                                     CARRINGTON
                         I'm afraid I'm rather busy right 
                         now, Captain. Might I ask you to --

                                     HENRY
                              (cutting in)
                         I've learned that you found a dog in 
                         the hothouse -- bled white by our 
                         Visitor. And you didn't report it.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         I didn't consider it necessary.

                                     HENRY
                         No? But it was necessary to let two 
                         friends of yours go in there and get 
                         killed!

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (evenly)
                         I did what you would have done. I 
                         put them there as guards. I was a 
                         guard myself. Their deaths were 
                         unavoidable. Whoever was in there 
                         would have been killed.

                                     HENRY
                         I also understand you're doing a 
                         little gardening.

               Carrington remains silent. Voorhees and Laurenz emerge from 
               behind the screen and stand at Carrington's side.

                                     HENRY
                         You might have notified me -- instead 
                         of letting me find it out from Miss 
                         Nicholson.
                              (Carrington scowls at 
                              this bit of news.  
                              Henry adds sharply)
                         Where are they?

               Carrington and his two cohorts are silent. They stand staring 
               at Ambrose and Redding. Dykes has stepped behind the screen.

                                     DYKES
                              (reappearing)
                         This way to the nursery, Pat.

               Henry, Ambrose and Redding step behind the screen.

               SCREENED IN TABLE

               Captain Henry and Lt. Dykes stare at the box of earth. Rigged 
               up over it are four plasma containers out of which blood is 
               dripping slowly.

               Carrington appears.

               Henry points at the plasma containers.

                                     HENRY
                              (grimly)
                         That's what your late colleagues are 
                         doing -- in the greenhouse. This is 
                         a distinct improvement.

                                     AMBROSE
                              (quietly)
                         We have read your notes, Arthur. I 
                         think you should have consulted the 
                         rest of us.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (coldly)
                         I have all the help I need.

                                     REDDING
                              (his eyes on the 
                              sprouts in the earth 
                              box)
                         I consider the situation extremely 
                         serious, Dr. Carrington.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (softly)
                         Your opinion has not been asked, Dr. 
                         Redding.

                                     REDDING
                              (quietly)
                         It has - by Captain Henry. And I've 
                         given it to him. I'll repeat it to 
                         you. We're facing something 
                         unpredictably dangerous. The creature 
                         in the green-house is obviously 
                         multiplying itself -- in this 
                         identical fashion. It will need more 
                         blood for its operations. It will 
                         make every effort to obtain what it 
                         needs.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         It has been imprisoned and 
                         immobilized.

                                     REDDING
                         We don't know its powers... or its 
                         resources. We can not be sure of our 
                         safety -- or of something even more 
                         important -- the world's safety. We 
                         have no knowledge of how much it can 
                         multiply. A thousand creatures -- or 
                         ten thousand of the sort we've seen 
                         could --

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (interrupting)
                         I'm not interested in your fantasies, 
                         Dr. Redding.

                                     AMBROSE
                         Redding's right. The thing has to be 
                         destroyed, Arthur, and its progeny 
                         along with it.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         Never.

                                     HENRY
                              (ignoring Carrington)
                         What do you think is the best 
                         procedure, Dr. Redding?

                                     REDDING
                         We'll analyze these things in the 
                         box first, and see what sort of gas 
                         or chemical has the quickest effect 
                         on them. And then use it in the 
                         greenhouse.

                         A high electric voltage should be

                         You're talking like a frightened

                         Electricity sounds good to me. We'll 
                         shoot it into the greenhouse and --

                              (interrupting angrily)
                         I forbid -- any destruction!

                                     LAURENZ
                         It would be an outrage!

                                     VOORHEES
                              (at the same time)
                         A cowardly betrayal of science!

                                     HENRY
                              (grimly)
                         This isn't science! This is a military 
                         action against an enemy invader. Go 
                         ahead, gentlemen. Get MacAuliff, 
                         Lieutenant.
                              (to Redding)
                         Mr. MacAuliff will be in charge of 
                         the electrical operations.

               The door opens and the post's radio man, Ezra Hendrix enters.

                                     HENDRIX
                              (excitedly)
                         I got your message through, Dr. 
                         Carrington! And the answers are still 
                         coming. I had to take them in 
                         shorthand.
                              (he starts reading)
                         Fogarty to Henry. Carrington informs 
                         me Martian alive. You are directed 
                         to make every effort to keep it alive, 
                         and protect it against any injury. 
                         General MacLaren arriving tonight 
                         with fourteenth squadron -- and full 
                         government personnel including 
                         Secretary of State. Chief of staff 
                         already here. Under no circumstances 
                         take action against Martian until 
                         our arrival at post soon as weather 
                         permits. Confirm instantly.
                              (Hendrix looks up)
                         There's one for you, Doctor. Fogarty 
                         to Carrington -- give Henry all 
                         cooperation needed to insure survival 
                         of creature you describe. Army and 
                         science chief regard your captive 
                         most important in human history.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         You have your orders, Captain Henry, 
                         and I have mine. I consider them 
                         sane and intelligent.

                                     HENDRIX
                         I got to get back. That loon Skeely's 
                         got a story longer than the Bible he 
                         wants me to send.

               Henry starts with Hendrix for the door.

                                     EDDIE
                         What do we do, Pat?

                                     HENRY
                         We get on that radio and try changing 
                         the Army's mind.

               He walks out.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. ROOM OCCUPIED BY HENRY AND HIS CREW. 1 A.M.

               MacAuliff and Barnes are sleeping on cots. Captain Henry is 
               preparing to lie down. He goes to the window and looks out 
               at the wildly whirling snow.

                                     HENRY
                              (muttering)
                         That stinkin' wind!
                              (he turns toward one 
                              of the cots)
                         You think our plane's still in one 
                         piece, Mac?

               There is no answer from the sleeping MacAuliff. The door 
               opens and Eddie comes in. He wears his flying suit. He carries 
               a Kerosene hurricane light.

                                     EDDIE
                              (wearily)
                         Baby, am I bushed! That bitchy wind 
                         cuts you in half.
                              (he hands Henry the 
                              lamp)
                         Mind filling this up? Burned dry. 
                         You'll need it outside. Blacker than 
                         Fogarty's heart.
                              (he starts removing 
                              his suit as they 
                              talk)
                         Anything new?

               Henry starts filling the lamp out of a large kerosene can.

                                     HENRY
                              (grimly-quoting)
                         Fogarty to Henry. Your attitude 
                         inviting court martial. Fogarty to 
                         Henry. Your hysterics are unbecoming 
                         to officer -- also black mark for 
                         entire air corps.

                                     EDDIE
                              (wearily)
                         That pook head! He thinks we're 
                         running a ministrel show.
                              (he has lain down on 
                              the cot)
                         When do I stand guard again?

                                     HENRY
                         Four hours.

                                     EDDIE
                              (snuggling into pillow)
                         In that case, excuse me.
                              (he sighs and mutters 
                              sleepily)
                         Remember Guadalcanal -- those nice 
                         warm nights?

               Henry has lighted the hurricane lamp.

                                     HENRY
                         If this rotten weather would only 
                         quit for a minute -- they can come 
                         in and court martial me all they 
                         like. Hendrix says it won't blow 
                         itself out for two more weeks. He 
                         was up here once with --

               A snore comes from Eddie and Captain Henry stops talking. He 
               sits down on a cot to remove his shoes. There is a knock on 
               the door. Henry goes to it and opens it. Nikki comes in. She 
               is in a night robe and slippers. She carries a small toilet 
               kit and a blanket.

                                     NIKKI
                              (brightly)
                         Have you got room?

                                     HENRY
                         Come in. I was just going to bed.

                                     NIKKI
                         Thought I'd join you -- if you don't 
                         mind.

                                     HENRY
                         Don't mind at all.

                                     NIKKI
                         I brought my own blanket -- if you 
                         have an extra cot.

                                     HENRY
                         I think we can -- arrange something.

                                     NIKKI
                              (sitting down on a 
                              cot)
                         This one's empty.

                                     HENRY
                         It's mine.
                              (she starts to get up)
                         Perfectly all right -- you can use 
                         it.

               He sits down beside her.

                                     NIKKI
                              (nervously)
                         You don't mind sleeping with one of 
                         the men.

                                     HENRY
                         It's not my usual preference.

                                     NIKKI
                              (laughing a little 
                              loudly)
                         Mine either.

                                     HENRY
                              (frowning)
                         Shh. No sense in waking them up. 
                         They're very tired.

                                     NIKKI
                              (solemnly)
                         Sorry.
                              (he puts his arm around 
                              her as she peers at 
                              the sleepers)
                         I'll try not to disturb them.

                                     HENRY
                         You can lie down, if you care to.

                                     NIKKI
                         I can't.

                                     HENRY
                         Why not?

                                     NIKKI
                         I'm scared to death. The minute I 
                         lie down, I jump up.

                                     HENRY
                         Maybe I can relax you, baby.

                                     NIKKI
                         Please -- no massages.

                                     HENRY
                         Can't you think of me as something 
                         beside a masseur?

                                     NIKKI
                         Yes.
                              (she looks at him 
                              nervously)
                         Please make love to me.

                                     HENRY
                              (holding her)
                         You're shaking.

                                     NIKKI
                         I know. It'll take my mind off -- 
                         what's making me shake -- that what- 
                         is-it.

                                     HENRY
                              (gently)
                         You're very sweet. Perfect skin, 
                         perfect nose -- everything perfect.

                                     NIKKI
                         Thank you.
                              (she stares at him 
                              and adds softly)
                         Please go on.

                                     HENRY
                         Your mind isn't on it.

                                     NIKKI
                         Yes -- it is. Honestly it is. You 
                         said I was perfect.

                                     HENRY
                         If you lie down you'll stop shaking, 
                         baby.

                                     NIKKI
                         I won't.

                                     HENRY
                         Just try it.

                                     NIKKI
                         You -- you can't make love to me if 
                         I'm lying down.

                                     HENRY
                         Yes I can. It doesn't interfere at 
                         all.

                                     NIKKI
                         Pat -- do you really love me? Or are 
                         you just talking because I asked you 
                         to?
                              (Henry has turned his 
                              head toward a clicking 
                              noise coming from 
                              the direction of 
                              MacAuliff's bed. 
                              Nikki frowns at him)
                         Now whose mind isn't on it?

                                     HENRY
                              (looking at her)
                         Darling.

                                     NIKKI
                              (smiling nervously at 
                              him)
                         I understand perfectly.

                                     HENRY
                         What?

                                     NIKKI
                         A room full of kibitzers and a monster 
                         floating around -- it's a little 
                         difficult kissing a girl under such 
                         conditions.

                                     HENRY
                              (his ears cocked at 
                              the continuing 
                              clicking)
                         You're wonderful.

               He kisses her.

                                     NIKKI
                              (after the kiss)
                         That's very -- relaxing. I feel much 
                         better. I'll -- I'll lie down, it 
                         you don't mind.

               She lies down on the cot. As she does, Henry stands up. She 
               looks at him with some surprise.

                                     HENRY
                         That clicking. Sounds like. No -- it 
                         couldn't be --
                              (he smiles tensely at 
                              the recumbent Nikki)
                         Excuse me.
                              (he goes to MacAuliff's 
                              bed and shakes him 
                              gently)
                         Mac, Mac -- wake up.
                              (MacAuliff opens his 
                              eyes)

                                     MACAULIFF
                         What's the matter?

                                     HENRY
                              (gesturing toward the 
                              clicking)
                         Hear that?

               MacAuliff listens for a second, then sits up swiftly.

                                     MACAULIFF
                         The counter!

                                     HENRY
                         I thought so!

               MacAuliff jumps up and grabs at a duffle bag that lies at 
               the foot of his bed.

                                     NIKKI
                         What is it?

                                     HENRY
                         The Geiger counter.

                                     NIKKI
                         Why should it be clicking now?

                                     HENRY
                         There's something moving around that's 
                         radio active.

                                     NIKKI
                         Oh, no -- no!

               MacAuliff lifts the counter out of his duffle bag and stares 
               at it. It continues to click, its rhythm accelerating 
               slightly. Henry darts to the intercommunication panel at his 
               desk.

                                     HENRY
                              (pushing a button)
                         Ericson! Ken! This is Pat. Come in -- 
                         quick!

               A moment's silence.

                                     ERICSON'S VOICE
                         Ericson here --

                                     HENRY
                              (rapidly into speaker)
                         Any trouble down there?

                                     ERICSON'S VOICE
                         Not a thing, Pat.

                                     HENRY
                         Who's on duty outside?

                                     ERICSON'S VOICE
                         Dr. Ambrose and what's his name, the 
                         carpenter.

                                     HENRY
                         Beat it out there, as fast as you 
                         can. Check that rear door and call 
                         me back!

                                     ERICSON'S VOICE
                         Will do.

               Henry turns to MacAuliff and Nikki who are staring fearfully 
               at the counter. The clicking has continued to gain in volume 
               and metre.

                                     MACAULIFF
                         It's getting stronger.

               Henry grabs a pillow from the bed and an ice axe from his 
               desk. He runs to the door, opens it and cautiously peers 
               down the hall. MacAuliff and Nikki watch him tensely.

                                     HENRY
                              (after a moment)
                         Nothing. Not a sign --

               Nikki gives a long sigh of relief.

                                     NIKKI
                         My heart's pounding like a horse 
                         running away.

                                     MACAULIFF
                              (shaking the counter)
                         Suppose this thing's gone nuts?

                                     HENRY
                              (dropping the pillow 
                              and ice axe)
                         I sure hope so. Let me see it.
                              (he takes the counter; 
                              the clicking is now 
                              quite rapid)
                         It looks okay.

               There is a movement outside the window. No one in the room 
               sees it.

                                     MACAULIFF
                         Maybe Dr. Carrington is experimenting 
                         some more.

                                     NIKKI
                              (hopefully)
                         That's possible. Shall I call him?

               The intercom speaks.

                                     ERICSON'S VOICE
                         Everything's in order outside, Pat.

                                     HENRY
                              (into intercom)
                         Thanks, Ken.

               He snaps the intercom shut.

                                     MACAULIFF
                              (eyes glued on the 
                              counter)
                         I sure don't get it.

                                     HENRY
                         Call Carrington, Nikki.

                                     NIKKI
                              (pressing a switch on 
                              the intercom)
                         Dr. Carrington -- Dr. Carrington.  
                         This is Nikki, Arthur.

               A moment's pause, then Carrington's sleepy voice comes from 
               the intercom.

                                     CARRINGTON'S VOICE
                         Yes, Nikki?

                                     NIKKI
                         I'm in Captain Henry's room. His 
                         Geiger counter is counting Geigers 
                         like mad. He wants to know if it 
                         might be picking up anything that 
                         you're doing.

                                     CARRINGTON'S VOICE
                         No. What's the reading?

                                     MACAULIFF
                         Eight point six. And going up.

                                     NIKKI
                              (repeating into 
                              intercom)
                         Eight point six. And going up.

                                     CARRINGTON'S VOICE
                         I'll be right down.

               The intercom snaps off. Suddenly the Geiger counter starts 
               purring like a rattlesnake.

                                     HENRY
                              (his voice rising)
                         Eddie! Barnes! Get up!
                              (Dykes and Barnes sit 
                              up in alarm)
                         Grab your guns -- axes are better -- 
                         Nikki, take this!
                              (he seizes the mattress 
                              on his cot and pushes 
                              it at Nikki)
                         Sit in the corner -- hold that over 
                         you!
                              (to MacAuliff)
                         Where's your tommy-gun?

                                     MACAULIFF
                         Here!

               He pulls tommy-gun from under his bed and brandishes it.

                                     DYKES AND BARNES
                         What's up? Where is it?

               A CRASH from the window is their answer.

                                     HENRY
                         Pillows! Get those pillows in front 
                         of your faces!

               A second CRASH sends the entire window hurtling into the 
               room. The Creature springs into their midst.

               GUNS ROAR. The Creature moves toward MacAuliff. His tommy-
               gun chatters at it point-blank. It strikes at the tommy-gun, 
               knocking it out of MacAuliff's hands, and sending MacAuliff 
               sprawling.

               The Creature jumps after MacAuliff. It is balked for a moment 
               by Henry who strikes it with his ice axe.

               A bullet hits the light. Only the dim light of the kerosene 
               lamp remains.

               The Creature whips its knifed hand at Henry's face. Henry 
               partially blocks the blow with his pillow which shreds in 
               the air. Henry staggers back against the wall. He almost 
               knocks over the hurricane lamp. He picks it up and dashes it 
               at the Creature. Flaming kerosene spatters over it. As it 
               stands burning torch-like in the middle of the room Barnes 
               moves forward and strikes a mighty blow with his axe. The 
               blow misses. Instantly the Creature wheels and seizes Barnes 
               by the throat. Barnes screams once. His scream gurgles away. 
               Dykes, holding his entire cot in front of him as a shield, 
               rushes forward followed by Henry. They smash at the monster 
               which, still holding Barnes with one tentacle, retreats to a 
               corner of the room.

               It is the corner in which Nikki has been crouching. She 
               screams. The Creature whips its free talon at her and secures 
               her by the arm. Still afire, it starts dragging its two 
               victims toward the window. Nikki's screams fill the room. 
               Once more Henry charges forward with his ice axe and sinks 
               its pointed end into the Creature's head.

               The Creature stops, drops Nikki and lashes at Henry. This 
               time its arced knife-fingers slash Henry's wrist. Henry drops 
               the axe and falls back. Dykes, still shielded by his cot, 
               has at the same time grabbed Nikki's ankle and pulled her 
               away. MacAuliff has picked up the can containing the remainder 
               of the kerosene. He throws it on the Creature. The blaze 
               surges up.

               Parts of the room have caught fire. The Creature picks up 
               Barnes and springs out the window into the storm.

               For a moment its motion through the night is etched in fire. 
               Then the wind and snow extinguish the flames. The Creature 
               disappears.

               Dykes moves quickly from Nikki to bend over Henry who is 
               kneeling in silent agony, clutching his lacerated forearm.

               Dykes snaps on a flashlight.

                                     DYKES
                              (panting)
                         You all right, Pat?

                                     HENRY
                              (with difficulty)
                         Yeah.
                              (he nods toward Nikki)
                         How about her?

                                     DYKES
                         Fainted. Her arms cut. I think she's 
                         all right, though.

                                     MACAULIFF
                              (his fingers on Nikki's 
                              pulse)
                         Yes, she's all right.

                                     HENRY
                         Barnes -- he died quick, I think.

                                     DYKES
                         So do I.
                              (he points his 
                              flashlight at the 
                              floor)
                         That thing won't make much of a meal 
                         of the poor guy. Most of his blood's 
                         in here.

               There is a knock on the door.

                                     CARRINGTON'S VOICE
                         It's Dr. Carrington.

                                     HENRY
                         Come in.

               Dr. Carrington enters. Dykes' flashlight focuses on his face.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (blinking at the beam)
                         I heard shots -- what happened?

                                     HENRY
                         Dr. Carrington, I want everyone in 
                         this camp to assemble in the radio 
                         room immediately. Fully dressed. 
                         Bring medical supplies, provisions, 
                         and every weapon we've got.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         Your window -- is it -- was it the -- 
                         ?

                                     HENRY
                         It was. I'll give you all a full 
                         report in the radio room. Get going 
                         Doctor -- you, too, Eddie. Round 
                         everybody up. Get 'em barricaded 
                         before it comes back!

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INTERIOR RADIO ROOM - 2:30 A.M.

               Beyond the radio room is a short underground passage leading 
               into the generator room.

               All the members of the expedition, save Henry, MacAuliff and 
               Hendrix are in the radio room.

               Chapman is putting final touches on a bandage on Nikki's 
               arm.

               Two workers are nailing shut the trap door that leads to the 
               observation tower.

               Henry enters with Hendrix and MacAuliff following.

                                     HENDRIX
                              (to Henry)
                         ...not during the storm, Captain. 
                         But soon's it blows over I can get 
                         the transmitter out of your plane 
                         and rig up a two-way communication 
                         with Dutch Harbor.

               Henry nods. MacAuliff has taken two Geiger counters from a 
               ruck-sack in the corner. He returns to Henry.

                                     HENRY
                              (to MacAuliff)
                         Got 'em?
                              (as MacAuliff shows 
                              him the counters)
                         Eddie!

               Dykes turns from where he has been supervising the workers 
               at the trap door.

                                     HENRY
                         I'm going to station you and Mac at 
                         each end of the corridor. Take a 
                         counter along. If it starts clicking, 
                         report back here on the double.

                                     DYKES
                              (feelingly)
                         You bet.

                                     HENRY
                         I'll put Nikki on the intercom. She'll 
                         keep checking with you, so we'll 
                         know if you get taken by surprise.

                                     DYKES
                              (wryly)
                         That'll be a big help...
                              (He goes out with 
                              MacAuliff)

                                     HENRY
                              (to Nikki)
                         Got that, Nikki?

                                     NIKKI
                         Yes. Where's the intercom?

                                     HENRY
                              (pointing)
                         Over there. Hendrix'll show you.

               Nikki pulls a chair over to the intercom panel. Hendrix moves 
               to show her the levers that will connect her with Dykes and 
               MacAuliff. Skeely emerges from the generator room and crosses 
               to Henry.

                                     SKEELY
                         Hey, Captain, what's the sense of 
                         everybody huddling in here? Let's 
                         set some acetylene torches and hand 
                         grenades and stuff and rush the 
                         greenhouse.

                                     HENRY
                         It isn't in the greenhouse. I just 
                         checked.

                                     CHAPMAN
                         How did it get out, Captain?

                                     HENRY
                         Burned its way out. There's a big 
                         hole in the wall. Still hot.

                                     SKEELY
                              (incredulous)
                         Burned its way through an iron wall?

                                     HENRY
                         It's radio-active.

                                     CHAPMAN
                              (solemnly)
                         Probably can generate enough heat to 
                         burn its way through anything.

                                     NIKKI
                              (into intercom)
                         All right, Eddie? Over.

                                     EDDIE'S VOICE
                         Nothing yet.

                                     NIKKI
                              (into intercom)
                         All right, Mac? Over.

                                     MACAULIFF'S VOICE
                         All quiet here.

               At twenty second intervals, Nikki, Eddie and MacAuliff repeat 
               the same ritual.

                                     SKEELY
                         I still say we ought to corner that 
                         thing in the greenhouse. That's were 
                         it's growing its stuff -- it'll go 
                         back there --

                                     ERICSON
                              (growling)
                         Corner it with what, you dumb joker?  
                         Insect powder?

                                     AMBROSE
                              (coming up)
                         I've got enough cable to reach the 
                         nursery, Captain. Suppose we 
                         electrocute it?

                                     CHAPMAN
                         It might be immune to electricity.

                                     REDDING
                              (coming up)
                         It's not. I tried it, on one of those 
                         horrible sprouts.

               Carrington has been sitting nearby, his head in his hands.  
               He looks up angrily.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         You destroyed them!

                                     REDDING
                         Only one. It disintegrated under 
                         five hundred volts and burnt to an 
                         ash.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         I forbid you to do any more tampering! 
                         Our orders are clear. We are to wait --

                                     HENRY
                              (curtly)
                         I'm giving the orders.

               Carrington looks at Henry for a moment, then rises and goes 
               into the generator room. Henry ignores him.

                                     HENRY
                              (to Redding)
                         I think you've got something, Doctor.

                                     AMBROSE
                              (eagerly)
                         Shall I run the cable into the 
                         greenhouse?

                                     HENRY
                         Our pal isn't going back there.

                                     AMBROSE
                         But those things in the greenhouse 
                         are growing... They must need -- 
                         nourishment.

                                     REDDING
                              (to Henry: protesting)
                         You can't anticipate its moves. Its 
                         mind is of a different nature than 
                         ours.

                                     HENRY
                         A mind at war is always the same -- 
                         whether it's hatched in Tokyo or 
                         Mars. We know the thing's objective.

                                     SKEELY
                         What?

                                     HENRY
                              (nodding at Ambrose)
                         Nourishment. Blood, and all the blood 
                         in the camp is in this room. He'll 
                         be coming down the pike any minute 
                         now.

               As Henry speaks his eyes have been roving around the room.

                                     CHAPMAN
                         Perhaps we'd be wiser to disperse --

                                     HENRY
                         He'd get us one at a time.

                                     SKEELY
                              (eyeing Henry)
                         So what do we do?

                                     HENRY
                         We give him a welcome home party.
                              (he points to the 
                              corridor that leads 
                              to the generator 
                              room)
                         In that tunnel. And a great, big 
                         hotfoot.
                              (he turns to Redding)
                         Got any chicken wire -- cattle fence 
                         wire -- any kind of wire webbing?

                                     REDDING
                         Yes -- rolls of it.

                                     HENRY
                              (to Ericson)
                         Ken, take two men and help Doctor 
                         Redding bring the wire out. Lay it 
                         in that passage way. Then string it 
                         along the roof.

                                     SKEELY
                         Like a fly trap!

                                     HENRY
                              (to Ambrose, as Ken 
                              follows Redding out)
                         Splice your cable to the webbing. 
                         And fix up an operating switch on a 
                         long wire -- about thirty feet. How 
                         many volts can you give me?

                         Over a thousand.

                                     HENRY
                         That enough?

                                     AMBROSE
                         I earnestly hope so.

                                     HENRY
                         Got going, Doctor.

               Ambrose runs out. Nikki's exchanges with Dykes and MacAuliff 
               have been continuing at regular intervals. Now Nikki turns 
               to Hendrix.

                                     NIKKI
                         Take over for me, please, Mr. Hendrix.

               Hendrix sits at the intercom and starts checking with the 
               sentinels as Nikki goes to Henry. She pulls at his sleeve.

               Pat, don't you feel it? It's getting cold.

                                     HENRY
                              (paying no attention)
                         Everybody who's not working get back 
                         in the generator room. Make it snappy, 
                         please.

                                     NIKKI
                         Pat, I tell you I'm getting cold.

                                     HENRY
                         You sick?

                                     NIKKI
                         No, you dunce. It's cold. The heat 
                         must be off.

                                     HENRY
                              (calling to Chapman)
                         What's the thermometer reading?

                                     CHAPMAN
                              (glancing at a wall 
                              thermometer)
                         Fifty-four. I thought it was getting 
                         chilly.

                                     SKEELY
                         It sure is.

                                     CHAPMAN
                              (still staring at the 
                              thermometer)
                         It's going down fast.

                                     HENRY
                              (placing his hand 
                              over a heat vent)
                         There's no heat at all coming through 
                         the vents.

                                     CHAPMAN
                         We've got three furnaces. They 
                         couldn't all break down at once.

                                     SKEELY
                              (looking at the 
                              thermometer over 
                              Chapman's shoulder)
                         Going down. Forty-nine!

                                     CHAPMAN
                         Someone better go to the furnace 
                         room.

                                     HENRY
                         No, Doctor. There's nothing wrong 
                         with the furnaces.

                                     NIKKI
                         Must be, Henry. Why aren't they 
                         working?

                                     HENRY
                         Because they've been turned off. By 
                         our visitor.

                                     SKEELY
                         Holy Ike. He's gonna freeze us out!

                                     HENRY
                         And come in after us when we're numb 
                         or dead with cold.

                                     SKEELY
                         What a practical joker. Reminds me 
                         of General Rommel when we were "it."

                                     CHAPMAN
                              (reading from the 
                              thermometer)
                         Forty-five now.

                                     SKEELY
                         And it's sixty below outside.

               Redding, Ericson and two other scientists have emerged from 
               the storeroom with the wire rolls. They start to execute 
               Henry's orders.

                                     HENRY
                              (to Chapman)
                         How many flying suits are there, 
                         Doctor?

                                     CHAPMAN
                         Eight, counting yours. And one 
                         electric blanket.

               The telegraph instrument starts to chatter.

                                     HENDRIX
                              (calling)
                         Nikki.

                                     NIKKI
                         Coming.

               She replaces Hendrix at the intercom panel. Hendrix starts 
               taking down the telegraph message.

                                     HENRY
                              (to Chapman)
                         Leave me one for Nikki. Take the 
                         others in the generating room and 
                         tell the folks to take turns wearing 
                         'em. Ten minute shifts.

               Chapman moves to obey.

                                     SKEELY
                         Our friend's quite a boy. Figures 
                         all the angles.

                                     HENRY
                              (staring at the wiring)
                         Lucky thing we got Edison and Einstein 
                         on our side.

                                     SKEELY
                              (quietly)
                         Wonder if they're going to be enough.

                                     HENRY
                              (equally quietly)
                         I was wondering the exact same thing.

                                     ERICSON
                              (working)
                         My fingers are getting numb.

                                     SKEELY
                              (walking up and down 
                              to warm himself)
                         I remember once, in Accra, in 
                         equatorial Africa --

                                     ERICSON
                         Shut up. Nobody's listening.

                                     HENDRIX
                         Message for you Captain.

                                     HENRY
                         Hold it.
                              (to Chapman who is 
                              returning for another 
                              load of flying suits)
                         Got any rubber boots in that 
                         storeroom?

                                     CHAPMAN
                         Plenty of them.

                                     HENRY
                         Get us four pairs, will you.

               Chapman goes to the storeroom.

                                     SKEELY
                         What're the boots for?

                                     HENRY
                         So nobody gets burned accidentally 
                         when I turn the juice on.

                                     SKEELY
                              (calling after Chapman)
                         Make that five pair, Doctor!

                                     DYKES' VOICE
                              (over intercom)
                         It's coming!

                                     NIKKI
                              (relaying the warning)
                         Pat! It's coming!

                                     HENRY
                              (to Nikki)
                         Call Mac in!
                              (to the wire workers)
                         Almost finished?

                                     REDDING
                              (working frantically)
                         Another minute...

                                     AMBROSE
                              (calling from the 
                              other end of the 
                              corridor)
                         All ready on this end!

               Henry has moved to the door. He opens it. MacAuliff and Dykes 
               come running in. Henry shuts and bolts the door behind them.

                                     DYKES
                              (panting)
                         The counter's going. The reading's 
                         low, but it's going up. Oh, boy, 
                         it's cold!

               He hands the counter to Henry. Chapman has come out of the 
               storeroom with the boots. Skeely takes a pair, and the others 
               are dumped at the entrance of the passage-way.

                                     HENRY
                              (jerking his head 
                              toward the generator 
                              room)
                         Nikki -- back there. Get going.
                              (to the others)
                         Get those boots on, boys.

               He starts to pull on a pair himself. Carrington comes out of 
               the generator room. He looks at the cable hook-up Ambrose 
               has made, then glances up quickly at the wire-web installed 
               by Redding, etc.

                                     REDDING
                         That does it. All set, Captain.

                                     HENRY
                         Okay, everybody in the back room but 
                         Army personnel.

               Carrington strides up to Henry. His face is working 
               emotionally. He is about to address Henry, when Hendrix speaks 
               up.

                                     HENDRIX
                         How about your message, Captain?

                                     HENRY
                         Let's have it.

                                     HENDRIX
                              (reading)
                         MacLaren to Henry. Use every means 
                         to save lives of expedition. But 
                         take no steps against captive. Expect 
                         to relieve you in three days. Hold 
                         out well as you can. Your main 
                         objective is to keep creature alive

                         President, Chiefs of Staff, all 
                         superiors consider survival of captive 
                         creature greatest triumph for our 
                         civilization.

                                     DYKES
                         The biggest heroes are always back 
                         of the lines, eh?

                                     HENRY
                              (grimly)
                         Well -- that's that.

                                     SKEELY
                              (quietly)
                         How does that affect your plans, 
                         Captain?

                                     HENRY
                         Not at all.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (intensely)
                         You can not ignore your orders, 
                         Captain! They come from sources that 
                         know more than you!

               Henry finishes donning his boots. He stands up, and glances 
               coolly at Carrington.

                                     HENRY
                         We'll discuss that some other time.
                              (pointing to the rear 
                              door)
                         Inside, folks.

               Carrington stands glaring at Henry. He makes an effort to 
               control the fury in him.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (vibrantly)
                         You're defying orders from your 
                         superiors, Captain Henry. You've 
                         been directed to preserve the life 
                         of this interplanetary creature at 
                         all costs.

                                     DYKES
                              (from the thermometer)
                         The temperature is now thirty above.

                                     SKEELY
                         Perfect for skiing.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (tensely to Henry)
                         You are an officer in the United 
                         States Army in charge of a military 
                         mission. You have received 
                         instructions from your general -- 
                         and from every department of the 
                         government on how to proceed.

                                     HENRY
                         It's no fun breaking orders, Doctor. 
                         But my duty --

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (cutting in sharply)
                         Your duty is to the Army you 
                         represent!

                                     HENRY
                              (quietly)
                         My first duty as a man is to the 
                         human race. There's an enemy of it 
                         coming after us. I'm going to kill 
                         it.

               Redding enters from the corridor. He hands Henry a switch on 
               the end of a long wire.

                                     REDDING
                         Here's your operating switch.

                                     HENRY
                         Thanks.

               Redding glances curiously at Carrington and returns toward 
               the rear room. Dykes is standing by the intercom panel. He 
               pushes a button. A subdued squealing comes out of the 
               communicator.

                                     HENRY
                              (sharply)
                         What's that?

                                     DYKES
                         I've got the intercom open to the 
                         greenhouse. Listen to them.

               As he talks the room fills with an insistent mewing as if 
               from a myriad of voices.

                                     HENRY
                         Your friends sound hungry, Carrington.

                                     SKEELY
                              (as the voices rise)
                         They must be big boys now.

                                     DYKES
                         The wild carrots are coming -- !

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (his voice rising in 
                              anger)
                         You're doing more than breaking Army 
                         orders, Captain! You're robbing the 
                         human mind!

                                     HENRY
                         You can testify to that effect at my 
                         court martial, Doctor.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (tensely -- and 
                              controlling himself 
                              again)
                         A secret has come to us, greater 
                         than any secret ever revealed to 
                         science. It must not be destroyed! 
                         It must be studied -- and learned.

                                     HENRY
                              (quietly)
                         I saw it, Carrington. It's not 
                         something to put under glass -- and 
                         examine. And there are thousands 
                         more of them hatching. They'll 
                         reproduce like weeds. They'll tear 
                         the world apart.

                                     CARRINGTON
                         That doesn't matter!

                                     HENRY
                              (softly)
                         It kind of matters to me.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (growing wilder)
                         Knowledge is more important than 
                         life, Captain. We have only one excuse 
                         for existing -- to think, to find 
                         out, to learn what is unknown.

                                     DYKES
                         We haven't a chance to learn anything 
                         from that pookey Martian, except a 
                         quicker way to die, Doctor.

                                     HENRY
                         I'm ordering you back, Carrington.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (full of a curious 
                              fury)
                         It doesn't matter what happens to 
                         us! We're not animals. We're a brain 
                         that thinks! Nothing else counts, 
                         except our thinking. We've thought 
                         our way into nature. We've split the 
                         atom --

                                     DYKES
                         Yeah, and that sure made the world 
                         happy, didn't it!

               The mewing out of the wall speaker increases.

                                     HENRY
                         I've ordered you out, Carrington.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (wildly)
                         We owe it to the brain of our species 
                         to stand here and die without 
                         destroying a source of wisdom!  
                         Captain, I beseech you. Science, 
                         government, the Army -- civilization 
                         has given us orders.

                                     HENRY
                              (grimly)
                         They're wrong orders. They come from 
                         people who don't know what they're 
                         talking about.

                                     SKEELY
                         I'm with you there, Henry. In a pinch 
                         I always put my money on a little 
                         man -- against all top brass.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (wildly to Henry)
                         You set yourself above all human 
                         progress, above all science!

                                     HENRY
                              (quietly)
                         I set myself against an enemy, 
                         Carrington.

                                     MACAULIFF
                         Come on, Doctor. You've said your 
                         piece. This is one time when science 
                         doesn't blow up the world... just to 
                         see what makes it tick.

                                     DYKES
                              (suddenly)
                         The Geiger!

               He picks up the counter. It is clicking more rapidly.

                                     HENRY
                         Inside, Carrington.

               Dykes seizes Carrington. The Doctor goes with him.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (from the door into 
                              the underground 
                              passage)
                         You're fools! You'll never hurt it! 
                         It's wiser, stronger --

                                     DYKES
                         Shut up -- !

               He pushes Carrington into the passage into the generator 
               room. Nikki, Chapman and Hendrix follow. Dykes shuts the 
               door behind them and then rejoins the group in the radio 
               room. It consists of Henry, MacAuliff, Ericson, Skeely and 
               Dykes. Henry turns and sees Skeely.

                                     HENRY
                         Sorry, Skeely. These are front lines. 
                         No civilians allowed.

                                     SKEELY
                         That does not include the Press, 
                         Captain.

                                     HENRY
                         Get in with the others, Skeely. You 
                         don't belong here.

                                     SKEELY
                              (grinning)
                         I didn't belong at Alamein or 
                         Bouganville -- or Okinawa. Just hung 
                         around as a kibitzer. I am also a 
                         very good obit writer. Ignore me, 
                         please.

               Henry grins and decides to ignore him. He turns to Dykes.

                                     HENRY
                         You got the Geiger, Eddie.

                                     DYKES
                         Yeah, no change.

                                     MACAULIFF
                         The temperature is now twenty-two.

                                     HENRY
                         Keep moving around. That'll help a 
                         little.

                                     ERICSON
                              (trying to keep his 
                              voice casual)
                         Excuse me, Pat, but wouldn't it be a 
                         better idea to wait at the other end 
                         of the tunnel.

                                     HENRY
                         No, Ken. We receive in here.

                                     DYKES
                         Any reason, Pat?

                                     HENRY
                         Psychology. Our boy seems kind of 
                         smart. He's going to notice an empty 
                         room -- and a lot of fence wire laid. 
                         And sit down to think it over -- for 
                         a few hours. But if it finds us out 
                         here waiting, he'll chase us back 
                         into the trap.

                                     SKEELY
                         Providing we are able to move.

                                     HENRY
                         That's right.

                                     SKEELY
                         Frozen bait, eh?

                                     MACAULIFF
                         How can it get cold so quick?
                              (to Dykes)
                         You're turning blue.

                                     HENRY
                         Keep moving, boys.

               They pace.

                                     ERICSON
                         Must be zero.

                                     DYKES
                              (from the thermometer)
                         Was. Next stop five below.

                         Come, Mr. Martian -- and get some 
                         nice Scotch blood -- 110 proof.  
                         Nothin' like it for babies!

                              (pacing)
                         Cut it out -- !

                                     MACAULIFF
                         I never thought I'd be in a hurry to 
                         see that lad again.

                                     ERICSON
                              (gesturing toward the 
                              intercom from which 
                              the mewing noises 
                              are still issuing -- 
                              now in a sudden 
                              crescendo)
                         Those things give me the fantods. 
                         Okay if I shut it off, Captain?

                                     SKEELY
                         No, don't. I like the gooseflesh.  
                         Keeps me warm.

               There is a moment or two of silence. The men keep moving and 
               swinging their arms.

                                     DYKES
                         I don't hear the Geiger.

                                     HENRY
                         It's going.

                                     ERICSON
                         Faster?

                                     HENRY
                         Two points.

                                     DYKES
                         Then he's on his way!

                                     MACAULIFF
                         Maybe. I got a worry.

                                     DYKES
                              (to Henry, saluting 
                              like a courier)
                         Report from the front, Captain. 
                         Brother MacAuliff has a worry.

                                     MACAULIFF
                         It's no joke.

                                     ERICSON
                              (tensely)
                         Spill it!

                                     MACAULIFF
                         What if it can read our minds?

                                     DYKES
                              (pacing)
                         It's going to be sore when it gets 
                         to you -- a blank page.

                                     MACAULIFF
                              (angrily)
                         They're working on telepathy in this 
                         country ain't they? So they've 
                         probably got it on Mars, considerin' 
                         the superior type of carrots they 
                         produce. So it knows everything we're 
                         sayin' and thinking and it'll wait 
                         till we're froze stiff in our own 
                         trap before it --

                                     HENRY
                              (sharply)
                         It's coming closer.
                              (the mewing has 
                              stopped. There is 
                              silence. The Geiger 
                              counter is heard 
                              clicking)
                         Up two more points.

                                     DYKES
                              (pats Henry on the 
                              back)
                         A real strategist. You'll be a general 
                         yet.

                                     SKEELY
                         Not a chance. Not enough fat in his 
                         head.

                                     ERICSON
                              (staring at the counter 
                              in Henry's hand)
                         It's standing still now.

                                     DYKES
                         Getting its wind.

                                     HENRY
                         Keep moving --

                                     SKEELY
                              (as he paces)
                         I remember the first electrocution I 
                         ever covered. Ruth Snyder and Judd 
                         Grey. I'll never forget how Madam 
                         Snyder bounced in the chair when 
                         they gave her her last permanent. We 
                         were all watching her eyes and --

                                     HENRY
                              (sharply)
                         Hold it!

               Skeely becomes silent. The quickened clicking of the Geiger 
               fills the room.

                                     DYKES
                              (softly)
                         Thar she blows!

                                     HENRY
                              (his voice precise)
                         When it comes in, you get into the 
                         passage first, Skeely.
                              (he points to the 
                              opened passage door)
                         You next, Ken. Then Mac, then Eddie. 
                         Got that?
                              (the men nod)
                         Don't start falling back till its in 
                         the room and sees us. I'll carry the 
                         switch. Take care when I turn the 
                         juice on that you don't touch the 
                         walls. You'll get electrocuted if 
                         you do.

                                     MACAULIFF
                         What if the thousand volts aren't 
                         enough, Pat?

                                     DYKES
                         Five hundred burned one of the 
                         sprouts.

                                     MACAULIFF
                         You can kill a baby with a fly swatter -- 
                         you need a baseball bat for a man. 
                         How do we know it won't walk right 
                         through.

                                     HENRY
                              (curtly)
                         We don't know. But we'll find out. 
                         All set?

                                     DYKES
                              (quietly)
                         Yes, sir.

               The Geiger counter is now clicking loudly. Holding axes and 
               hatchets in their gloved hands, the men take their positions 
               as Captain Henry indicated.

                                     HENRY
                              (quietly)
                         If the voltage doesn't stop it, keep 
                         swinging at its arms.

                                     MACAULIFF
                              (suddenly)
                         It's outside! It's coming in!

               A creaking of wood comes from the doorway.

                                     SKEELY
                         Yeah, we got a caller.

                                     HENRY
                         Wait till it shows -- before you 
                         move!

               At this moment the lights go out.

                                     SKEELY
                              (in the dark)
                         What the holy -- !

                                     MACAULIFF
                              (calling in the dark)
                         The juice is off!

                                     ERICSON
                              (bawling out in the 
                              dark)
                         Put on the lights.

               The Geiger clicking and the mewing fill the darkness. The 
               outline of the door begins to glow in the dark, as the 
               Creature burns away at it.

                                     NIKKI'S VOICE
                              (yelling)
                         Pat!! Pat! Carrington's disconnected 
                         the generator!

                                     HENRY'S VOICE
                         Mac! Come with me! Eddie -- hold 
                         that thing back as long as you can!

                                     DYKES
                         Roger --

                                     REDDING'S VOICE
                              (calling down the 
                              passageway)
                         Captain Henry -- Watch out -- 
                         Carrington's got a gun!

               We hear the sound of feet crashing against the wire webbing 
               as Henry and MacAuliff run along the tunnel. The doorway's 
               outline continues to glow more brightly.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. GENERATOR ROOM

               It is entirely dark. Henry's flashlight stabs into the room. 
               It swivels around quickly, pausing briefly on Nikki's panicky 
               face, flashing over the frightened faces of the others, then 
               finding Carrington. Carrington stands with a gun in his hand, 
               staring wildly.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (as the flashlight 
                              hits him)
                         I'll shoot! I'll shoot if anyone 
                         touches that generator!

               Henry's response is to charge forward. He grabs the revolver 
               with one hand, and hits Carrington with the other. Carrington 
               falls unconscious, alongside the generators. Henry seizes 
               Carrington's revolver.

                                     HENRY
                              (as he retrieves the 
                              revolver)
                         Mac! Redding! Get those generators 
                         connected!

               He darts out as Mac and Redding turn their flashlights on 
               the generator and fall to work.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. RADIO ROOM

               The redly glowing door begins to fall inward. As it topples, 
               Dykes' voice is heard.

                                     DYKES
                         Never mind the guns. Use your axes!

               The Creature stands revealed in the doorway radioactivity 
               causes it to shimmer weirdly in the dark. It pauses a moment 
               in the doorway, then moves toward the little group in the 
               mouth of the passagway.

                                     HENRY'S VOICE
                              (in the dark)
                         Fall back, fellows -- Get going, 
                         Skeely! You nest, Ken! Move!

               The group retreats in order down the passageway. The Thing 
               pauses at the entrance of the corridor.

                                     MACAULIFF'S VOICE
                              (in the dark)
                         All connected -- Okay, Pat --

               The tunnel lights begin to glow redly, revealing the Army 
               group retreating over the fence wire. The Creature is 
               advancing toward them, but has not yet entered the trapped 
               tunnel.

                                     ERICSON
                         It's connected! What're you waiting 
                         for, Pat?

                                     HENRY
                              (coolly)
                         I'm waiting to catch it in the middle 
                         of the tunnel, Ken. Take it easy, 
                         son.

               At this moment there comes the sound of a scuffling from the 
               generator room. A figure bursts out into the tunnel, as we 
               here a chorus of "Grab him," "Shut the door," "Hold him -- 
               he's crazy," etc. The figure is Carrington. He pushes by 
               Henry, Dykes and the rest of the Army group, and runs the 
               length of the corridor. He comes to a halt at the far end of 
               the corridor, facing the Creature. Carrington, only a few 
               feet away from the unearthly visitor, extends his arms in a 
               pleading gesture.

                                     HENRY
                              (during this)
                         Grab him! Eddie! Stop him!

                                     DYKES
                         Too late. Shall I go get him?

                                     HENRY
                              (after a split second)
                         No. No, Eddie, don't. Fall back.

               The army group continues to retreat.

                                     CARRINGTON
                              (his face dimly visible 
                              in the refracted 
                              light of the 
                              Creature's 
                              phosphoresence)
                         Listen to me -- I'm your friend! 
                         Look, my hands are in the air -- I 
                         have no weapons -- I'm your friend -- 
                         you must understand that. You're 
                         wiser than I -- you must understand 
                         I'm trying to help you -- Don't come 
                         any further. They'll kill you!! Look 
                         at me, I'm defenseless -- you must 
                         see that I don't mean to hurt you -- 
                         I want to know you -- to help you -- 
                         Believe me! You have a greater 
                         intelligence than anything on Earth -- 
                         Use it -- use it -- look at me and 
                         know what I'm trying to tell you -- 
                         I'm not your enemy -- I'm a scientist -- 
                         a scientist!

               The Creature has paused before Carrington's tirade as if 
               studying him. Now, without haste, it lifts one arm, and flicks 
               its hand at Carrington's throat. Carrington falls to the 
               floor almost decapitated, his last words still gurgling in 
               his throat. The Creature steps over Carrington's corpse and 
               enters the tunnel. It advances five or six steps.

                                     HENRY
                              (crying sharply)
                         Watch out! Here we go!

               He presses the switch in his hand. A bombardment of huge 
               sparks leaps from ceiling to floor. The Creature is caught 
               in the lightning flashes. It stands motionless as the thousand 
               volt bolts crack through it from head to foot. In front of 
               it stand the five men -- axes ready, and weirdly visible in 
               the spitting light. The Creature begins to glow like a 
               filament, then bursts into flame. It sinks to the ground.

                                     HENRY
                         Don't move anybody!

                                     SKEELY
                              (pointing a small 
                              camera)
                         Keep that light going! I got him! I 
                         got him!

               The Creature's form melts in the flames. As it dwindles away, 
               Henry ends the spark bombardment. The lights of the passage 
               come up full. The men move toward the heap of ashes remaining 
               of the Creature.

                                     HENRY
                              (to Mac)
                         Go tell them it's over -- and to get 
                         the furnace going.

               As MacAuliff moves to obey, Chapman, Nikki and a number of 
               the refugees come out of the generator room.

                                     NIKKI
                         Dr. Carrington -- what happened to 
                         him.

                                     HENRY
                              (quietly)
                         He's dead.

                                     SKEELY
                              (to Henry. Kneeling 
                              over Carrington's 
                              remains)
                         A clean sweep, Captain. Both monsters 
                         are dead.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               INT. RADIO ROOM 7 A.M.

               The wind is still blowing, the snow still swirling outside 
               the tower windows.

               Hendrix sits exhausted at his radio sending panel.

               Skeely is hoarse and almost out on his feet with sleep. He 
               drinks coffee. A coffee pot is boiling over on an electric 
               stove beside him.

               Captain Henry sits on the cot bed. He is trying to stay awake.

                                     CHAPMAN
                              (to Henry)
                         Those pills taking hold?

                                     HENRY
                              (foggily)
                         I'll say.

                                     CHAPMAN
                         Don't fight them. Relax.

                                     HENRY
                         I've got to --

                                     CHAPMAN
                         That can all wait. First you have 
                         got to rest. We all do.

               He goes out.

                                     SKEELY
                              (drinking coffee)
                         She clear?

                                     HENDRIX
                         Just a minute.
                              (into Mike)
                         Dutch Harbor, can you hear me?

                                     VOICE
                              (back out of radio)
                         Dutch Harbor -- reception clear.

                                     SKEELY
                              (excited and hoarse)
                         I'm on!

                                     VOICE
                         General Fogarty standing by for 
                         Captain Henry.

                                     HENRY
                              (eyes closed)
                         Coming -- I'm coming.

               Instead he sinks onto the cot bed.

                                     SKEELY
                              (at the microphone)
                         North Pole, November 15 -- Ned Skeely 
                         reporting --

                                     VOICE
                              (coming back)
                         General Fogarty standing by for 
                         Captain Henry.

                                     SKEELY
                              (into mike)
                         Tell General Fogarty to read it in 
                         the papers. Flash. The world's 
                         greatest battle was fought and won 
                         today by the human race. Here at the 
                         top of the world a handful of American 
                         soldiers and civilians wiped out the 
                         first invasion from another planet.

                                     VOICE
                              (over radio)
                         Captain Henry -- come in. General 
                         Fogarty standing by.

               As Skeely continues to broadcast, Nikki enters. She looks 
               around sleepily. She sees Henry stretched out on the cot 
               bed, goes to him and starts shaking him awake. But nothing 
               will rouse him.

               Failing to bring Henry to wakefullness, Nikki smiles sleepily 
               and stretches out in the cot beside him. She closes her eyes.

               Henry opens his eyes and looks at her foggily. He tries to 
               embrace her but cannot.

                                     HENRY
                              (drowsily)
                         Untie me, honey.

                                     NIKKI
                         You bet I will. Tomorrow.

               Henry sticks his nose into her neck and falls happily asleep.

               During this Skeely is broadcasting.

                                     SKEELY
                              (answering voice)
                         Stand by, all newspapers! Flash 
                         continued! This first skirmish for 
                         the possession of the earth by the 
                         creatures from space was won by the 
                         daring leadership of Captain Patrick 
                         Henry. Noah once saved the world 
                         with an ark of wood. Captain Henry 
                         performed a similar service for our 
                         planet with an arc of electricity. 
                         But, ladies and gentlemen of the 
                         globe -- there is an enemy hovering 
                         over our heads -- an enemy with an 
                         armada of flying saucers, and an 
                         army of super human and fantastic 
                         warriors. Every citizen of the world 
                         must become a sentinel watching the 
                         skies. Keep looking for the next 
                         flying saucer -- watch the skies, 
                         watch everything over your head -- 
                         throw a ring of watch towers around 
                         the earth -- Keep looking --- looking -- 
                         looking --

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
