                    DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)
          Do you think that most people would 
          say that teenage beauty pageants are a 
          good idea?

                    GLADYS
          Oh yah-sure, I know what some of your 
          big city, no bra wearin', hairy-legged 
          women's libbers say, "Pageants are old-
          fashioned" and, uh, and "demeaning" to 
          the girls --

          What's sick is women dressin' like

                    GLADYS
          Y'betcha, Iris.  We still need a third 
          judge and we need to think of a theme.

     Servettes react with pleasure.

          Gladys -- Gladys!  Look out!

     A CAR SWERVES.

               (to camera)
          It's not his fault.  The communal wine 
          just proves too temptin' for some of 
          them.

                    IRIS
          Oh, there's a parking space over 
          there.  Oh, no, that's just a compact.  
          Sorry.

                    GLADYS
          You'd think they'd build the parking 
          lot of America to go with the Mall of 
          America!

     Gladys pulls into a HANDICAPPED SPOT.  Servettes and 
     CAMERA stand outside the car.  Iris points at the sign.

                    IRIS
          It's a two-hundred dollar fine!

                    GLADYS
          I said I'd move if a cripple came.  
          Let's just run in the store and pick 
          out some outfits.

          All right, let's go.

     EXT. MALL OF AMERICA PARKING LOT

     Iris and another Servette start to get out of the car.

                    GLADYS
          Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! 
          Wait!  I just thought of the theme.

     Iris and the Servette stop.

                    IRIS
          Oh!  What is it?

                    GLADYS (cont'd)

                    GLADYS
          Last year?  It was, "Buy American."

                    DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)
          And the year before that?

                    GLADYS

                    DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)
          Can you remember the theme of your 
          favorite pageant?

                    GLADYS
          "Can I?  I'm Amer-I-Can!"  People ask 
          me where I get this.  I don't know,

     Hormones take over and they lock lips again.  She wraps 
     her legs around him.  He feels up her ass.  They continue

                    GLADYS
          Oh, yeah, sure.  You know, every 
          pageant is special, but this one is 
          extra-special to me.  When I was 
          seventeen, I don't know if you know 
          this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's 
          American Teen Princess.  And this 
          year...drum roll please, my lovely 
          daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is 
          competin'.

     INT. HIGH SCHOOL

     camerman (O.S.).

                    BECKY
          Is this my mark?
               (it is)
          Hi, I'm Rebecca Leeman.  And I believe 
          this pageant is an important 
          experience for every young woman.  It, 
          well, it teaches you what's really 
          important in life, and it has the 
          power to change you in ways you've 
          never dreamed of.

     INT. GUN RANGE

     Becky, in shooting goggles and ear muffs, FIRES a Glock-
     17 9mm pistol with both hands.  Sign on wall reads: 
     "Lutheran Sisterhood Gun Club."  (See Iona in b.g. with 
     an arsenal of sniper weaponry.)

                    BECKY
               (yelling over noise)
          ...What?!  Klinghagen thinks it'll all 
          come down to me and Amber?

     Becky stops firing and takes off her hear muffs.

                    BECKY (cont'd)
          Well, you have to take everything Mrs. 
          Klinghagen says with a grain of salt.  
          Not all your Catholics go to communion 
          for the wafers, if you know what I 
          mean...

          for my thirteenth birthday... 

     SUPER: CONTESTANT #6, BECKY LEEMAN
          
          I'll always remember what she wrote in 
          the card.  "Jesus loves winners."  
          That's why, no matter what I do...

     She shoves the magazine back in her pistol.

                    BECKY (cont'd)
          I aim to win.

     She smiles to camera, then violently fires off a few 
     rounds.  Zoom in on the MALE TARGET: several bullet holes 
     in the head.

          askin', "Why do all the guys chew 
          Copenhagen?"  You know?  I mean, if 
          you're seventeen and you're not a

          I'm gonna sing and dance to, "New

          make-up on.  What are you guys doin' 
          here?

     She's in full make-up.

                    AMBER
          What're you doin' here?

                    BECKY
          Oh, Amber, like you're the only one 
          who visits Mary.

                    MARY
               (to Becky)
          Who are you?

                    BECKY
               (covering)
          "Who are you?!"  Oh Mary, you kill me.
               (to camera)
          She always says that.  It's a little 
          game we play.  Every week - same dippy 
          little look on her face.  "Who are you 
          - who are you?"  Just like that.
               (in Mary's face)
          It's me - Becky - and I brought your 
          favorites.

     Becky puts the chocolates on Mary's lap, a few spill.  
     Throughout the following, Mary slowly reaches for them as 
     if they're forbidden fruit and she's a very hungry Eve.

                    AMBER
          How nice, Becky, she's anorexic.

     Becky roughly puts her hands over Mary's ears, who's now 
     gently petting the spilled chocolates in her lap.

                    BECKY
               (sotto, reprimanding tone)
          She's skinny, not deaf, Amber.

     Amber looks up to see Brett looking at her.  He smiles.  
     She smiles.  You can feel the attraction.  Amber becomes 
     girlishly self-conscious -- adjusting her rubber apron 
     and brushing hair out of her eyes with her big rubber 
     gloves.

     her clean his tray.

     clean off his own tray.  Becky can't believe his 
     defiance.

          the...

          Well, uh, I'm cuttin' out early today 
          to do a little duck huntin'...but, uh, 
          maybe I could call you tonight.

                    AMBER
          Yah-sure, fine...fine.

                    BRETT
          Okay...well, bye.

                    AMBER
          Bye.

     Amber smiles, gives a shy little wave - then, to camera.

                    AMBER (cont'd)
          Oh, God - you don't think Becky saw 
          you guys, do you?
               (nervously looking around)
          Look, you just shouldn't be in here...

                    DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)
          It's okay.  Doreen gave us hair nets.

                    AMBER
          No, listen.
               (whispering as she exits)
          We shouldn't talk here.  Stop by my 
          house tonight, okay?

     She looks around and motions them to rush off.

     EXT. HIGHWAY NEAR TRAILER PARK - EVENING

     From the CREW VAN we pass the crappy trailer homes that 
     are off the Highway.  (Patsy Cline's "King Of The Road" 
     PLAYS on the radio).

     EXT./INT. ATKINS TRAILER - EVENING

     Camera approaches the trailer.  SIGN on the door reads 
     "Annette's Family Hair Care."

     Inside, the kitchen has been turned into a mini hair 
     salon.  Annette gives Loretta, neighbor, mid-50's - a 
     bouffant.

                    LORETTA
          What do you mean, they take out her 
          butt?

          Oh, Jesus H. Christ!

                    LORETTA
          Are we on "Cops" again?

                    ANNETTE
          You could be quiet.

                    LORETTA

          well be talkin' to the wall."
               (then)
          You guys want a beer?

                    DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)
          No, thank you.  Is Amber here?

                    ANNETTE
          No.  You just missed her.  Amber got 
          called in to the bone gardens tonight.  
          You just missed her.  She's in a 
          helluva mood today, anyways.

                    LORETTA
          Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?

                    ANNETTE
          Loretta, shut it.

                    LORETTA
          Y'know, if you have, you got all the 
          pictures of the winner you need.

                    ANNETTE
          Shut it up, Loretta.

                    LORETTA
          Oh, Christ, it's true.

     Annette begins to comb out Loretta's hair.

                    LORETTA
               (drinking beer)
          Let's just say who should win, who 
          deserves to win is Amber.

                    ANNETTE
               (mumbled to self)
          Why don't you paint a big red target 
          on your ass, Loretta.

                    LORETTA
          She's the prettiest, y'know.  The best 
          damn tapper.  The most smartest...

                    ANNETTE
          "Most smartest?"  Oh, that's good, 
          Loretta.  Make sure you get a picture 
          of that.  "Most smartest."  We're 
          cuttin you off and sendin' you home.

     Annette takes Loretta's beer, starts to push her out.

                    LORETTA
          Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm 
          braggin' up your kid, here.

          Amber's gonna be the next Diane 
          Sawyer, y'know...

          I'll be right back.  See ya later.

     CAMERA follows Annette and Loretta.

                    ANNETTE (cont'd)
          They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn 
          it.

     Loretta holds onto the door frame so Annette can't push 
     her out.

                    DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)
          What makes you think that Becky's 
          going to win?

                    LORETTA
          Why do I think Becky'll win?  You're 
          talkin'...

          Don't pinch!.
               (back into camera)
          You're talkin' kbout the richest 
          family in a small town.  It's front 
          page news when one of kem takes a 
          shit.

          Can one of yous boys give me a ride 
          home?

                    ANNETTE
          Don't fall for it.  She lives two 
          trailers down.

                    LORETTA
          So?  Be real easy.

                    ANNETTE
          Go on home, Loretta.  Come on.  Go on, 
          the party's over.

     INT. LARSON FUNERAL HOME - HALLWAY - NIGHT

     A small sign on the door reads: "EMBALMING - Please 
     Knock!"

     PUSH INTO ROOM.  Amber, back to us, frantically applies 
     blusher to an OLD WOMAN.  Another BODY, covered with a 
     white sheet, is on the embalming slab.  The top and brim 
     of a HUNTING CAP can be seen.  She TURNS AROUND to see 
     the crew.

                    AMBER (cont'd)
               (surprised)
          Ahhh!  Je-sus-Christ-on-a-cross!
               (catching breath)
          Look, number one rule in a funeral 
          home - never sneak up on the livin'.  
          You never know who could have an 
          embalming needle or skull saw in their 
          hand.  Mr. Larson's son learned that 
          the hard way - he's buried next to my 
          Grandpa!

     Amber turns to the slab to continue working.  She pulls 
     off the SHEET to reveal BRETT, handsome football player, 
     still wearing his hunting plaid.

          Upset about Brett?  Nah.  Hazard of 
          the trade.  I don't really have time 
          for guys anyways.  It's weird, though.  
          He took it right between the eyes.  
          Don't often see that.

     EXT. GUN RANGE - DAY

     Becky thumbs bullets into a 12-gauge pump shotgun.

                    DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)
          So you know, Brett just got shot in 
          the head.

                    BECKY
               (cool as a cucumber)
          He did?  Well, huntin's

          Amber, I need Stella now!

     SUPER: MR. LARSON, OWNER, LARSON FUNERAL PARLOR

                    MR. LARSON (cont'd)
          The family's steamin' like a cow pie 
          in July.  Said she didn't look nothin' 
          like the picture they gave you.

     Amber turns from Brett and closes the coffin.

                    AMBER
          Sorry.  I just thought she might not 
          wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a 
          cheap whore.

                    MR. LARSON
          Well, your "cheap whore" is this 
          family's "lovin' mother."
               (pointing at Brett)
          The Clemens said to make him look like 
          he just came from snowmobilin'.  Pink 
          cheeks, and...

                    AMBER
               (starting to mist up)
          -- red nose and ears.  I know, I know.

     Mr. Larson PULLS Stella's coffin out.

          kcause...I'm scared, okay?
               (deep breath)
          I open my locker right after first 
          period and there's a picture of Tammy 
          Curry taped inside.

     THRESHER.

     She turns the picture over to reveal, "YOU'RE NEXT!"

     EXT. MOUNT ROSE - STREET

     TWIN OFFICERS lean against their car.  One prepares to 
     pack some snuff.

                    TWIN OFFICER #1
          Oh-yah, helluva way to go, there.  
          After some extensive investigation, we 
          figure the Curry girl musta been 
          drivin' and smokin' and KABLEWEY!

               (holding a Skoal tin)
          Not enough left of her to fill a tin.

     He puts a pinch between his cheek and gum.

     INT. EMBALMING ROOM - LATER

     A visibly upset Amber still applies make-up to Brett.

                    AMBER
          Yah-sure, Tammy liked to driver her 
          dad's thresher - she said the heavy 
          vibration helped her think, y'know?  
          But I know for a fact she only smoked 
          after a good drive.  You ask me or 
          anyone else who isn't scared to talk 
          about it - Tammy was murdered.
               (holding back tears)
          God, I bet Diane Sawyer never had to 
          deal with crap like this...
               (to crew guy)
          Toss me "Caucasian #5," would ya?

     A crew guy walks IN FRAME and hands her a make-up jar.

                    AMBER (cont'd)
          Man, I can't wait for fishin' 
          season...

     Mr. Larson bursts in, white as a corpse.

                    MR. LARSON
          Amber...

                    AMBER
          No, don't say it.  Another stray 
          bullet to the head.

     She adjusts Brett's red plaid hunting cap.

                    AMBER (cont'd)
          I'm gonna need more caps.

                    MR. LARSON
          You hafta go home.  There's some kinda 
          emergency at the trailer park.

                    AMBER
          Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring 
          home milk and a carton-a Luckys."

                    MR. LARSON
          No.  Loretta called.  There's been 
          a... a fire.

     She grabs the keys and RUNS OUT.

     EXT. TRAILER PARK STREET/INT. HEARSE - NIGHT

     Amber drives fast and furious as we come to what's left 
     of her trailer.  All the NEIGHBORS are out drinkin' 
     beers, eatin' food and watchin' the excitement.

                    AMBER
          Oh my God - no!  Is my mom okay?  Was 
          she home?

     Hearse SCREECHES to a halt.  We hear a THUD, then MOANS 
     from in back.  Amber jumps out.  Camera follows, a la 
     "COPS."  It's pandemonium with fire trucks, neighbors, an 
     ambulance, etc.

                    AMBER (cont'd)
          Mom!  Mom!?  MOMMMM!

     Loretta runs up to Amber as TWO FIREMEN approach.

                    FIREMAN #1
          You family?

                    LORETTA
          No, she's just screamin' "Mom, Mom!" 
          kcause she's got Tourettes... She's 
          Annette's kid, dipshit.

                    AMBER
               (to Loretta)
          Is Mom okay?

                    LORETTA

                    AMBER
          Where is she?!

                    LORETTA
          She's right over there.

     Camera pans over to see a semi-conscious Annette as they 
     load her stretcher into the ambulance, shut the doors and 
     start to pull away.  Amber runs after them.

                    AMBER
          Mommmm!  I'll be right behind you in 
          the hearse!

     ELEVATED.

                    DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)
          So, doctor, is this sort of an unusual 
          injury here?

                    DOCTOR
          Oh you betcha, this was a doozy.  
          Right now, our chief concern is to

          remove this here.

          I heard you, I was just tryin' to

          for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung 
          to your tap shoes while flyin' through 
          the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!

                    AMBER
          Oh God, I'm dead...

     A candy striper approaches them.

                    CANDY STRIPER
          Hey, lil' Miss Sad-pants and her 
          friend Serious Sally, how kbout some 
          nice cool mints to turn those frowns 
          upside-down. "S."

                    LORETTA
               (to candy striper)
          D'ya think a nice cool mint'd help if 
          I shoved your head up your ass?

     Fear sweeps over the Candy Striper - she bolts down the 
     hall!  Loretta puts an arm around Amber and starts to 
     walk down the opposite direction.

                    AMBER
          So, what do I say?

                    LORETTA
          Simple.  Just say, "Mom, I know you 
          sacrificed everything - relationships, 
          dreams - your tummy, ass and thighs - 
          all to bring me into this world.  All 
          so I could have tap lessons and be in 
          the pageant - the same one you were 
          in.  But, y'know what?  I'm quittin'."  
          There.  Easy as pie.

                    AMBER
          Oh my God.  I'm so dead...

                    LORETTA
          Yeah, you betcha...

          Go on!  Get out!  

                    AMBER
          Mom, look, don't say anything.  First 
          of all, I'm not pregnant.

     Amber sits on the bed.  Annette grabs her shirt.

                    AMBER (cont'd)
          Mom!

                    ANNETTE
          I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me 
          what's up.  I'm reaching' a point 
          where I'd kill someone for the 
          nicotine on their fingernails.

                    AMBER
               (deep breath)
          Okay.  Yesterday I...I got this 
          picture.  So I kinda, y'know, I'm 
          thinkin' no.  I'm gonna, I-I-I'm gonna 
          quit the pageant.

                    ANNETTE
          What?!

     She hits Amber with her beer-canned hand.

                    AMBER
          Ow!

                    ANNETTE

     SHOT THROUGH the window.  Amber paces around Annette's 
     bed.

                    AMBER
          Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I-
          I'm not goin' through this again.

                    ANNETTE
          You're not goin' through this again?  
          You?  You're not the one who knows how 
          Jiffy Pop feels.

                    AMBER
          Oh, c'mon... First the picture of 
          Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this?  
          It's scary.

                    ANNETTE
          Let me tell you "scary," Amber.  Look 
          at me.  Do you wanna look like you 
          been rode hard and put away wet at my 
          age?  I'm a "lifer" here.  Best I can 
          hope for is to end up in a descent 
          "raisin ranch" where they'll change me 
          twice a day.

                    AMBER
          That's it, I'm goin'...

                    ANNETTE
          Honest to God, if I got to do it over?  
          I'd start walkin' outta this town the 
          minute I took my first step.  
          Practically the only thing I wouldn't 
          do different is have you...

     Amber sits on the bed.

                    AMBER
          God I hope that's you and not your 
          concussion talkin'.

                    ANNETTE
               (smiling)
          It's me...I just don't want this to be 
          the thing you'd do over.  This 
          pageant's your ticket outta here.  I 
          know you can win, Amber.

                    ANNETTE (cont'd)
          C'mere.  I love you so much.

                    AMBER

                    AMBER
          No.  Mom said if I did, she'd look up 
          my dad and marry him.

                    DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)
          So has your mom kept your dad's life a 
          secret?

                    AMBER
          No.  She never hid the fact that my 
          dad picked his career over us.  What'd 
          she used to say?

                    LORETTA
          "Once a carnie, always a carnie."

          "Bad wirin'?!"  Well, if that ain't 
          the biggest crock-a-shit ever.
               (turning on the candy 
               striper)
          Ooowwww-Jesus!  Did K-Mart have a sale

               (smiling to camera)
          My cousin just had a deaf baby and I 
          get to go see it!

                    AMBER
          Yah-sure, eight's my luck number 
          anyway.  Diane Sawyer was number eight 
          at her local.

                    JANELLE
          Thank you.

     INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - DAY

     ON STAGE "Through the Eyes of Love" plays as Janelle 
     performs her INTERPRETATIVE DANCE while signing the 
     words.  In the f.g., Gladys appears very serious.

                    GLADYS
               (loud whisper)
          I'll be honest.  This is a hard time 
          for me.  This is the part of the 
          pageant when you realize that tomorrow 
          night, all but one of these girls will 
          walk out of here a loser.  It's hard 
          for me to know how that must feel, but 
          I'm sure it doesn't feel good.

     In b.g., a BIG STAGE LIGHT FALLS on Janelle's head.  
     CRASH!  Gladys and CAMERA rush the stage.  "Through the 
     Eyes of Love" continues throughout.

     EXT. LORETTA'S TRAILER - PORCH - THAT NIGHT

     A very shaken Amber paces.

                    AMBER
          Don't you get it?  I was supposed to 
          go first.  I was contestant number 
          one.  That light was meant for my 
          head.  If Janelle hadn't wanted to 
          change numbers... God, I owe my life 
          to that deaf baby.

     Loretta enters, portable phone and drink in hand.

                    LORETTA
          That was your mom.  She wanted you to 
          have this.

                    AMBER
               (taking drink)
          Really, Loretta?

                    LORETTA
               (avoiding eye contact)
          You-betcha.

                    AMBER
          My mom wanted me to have this?

                    LORETTA
          Oh, shut up.  I thought it might help 
          you get some sleep.

                    AMBER
          Loretta, never have kids.

                    LORETTA
          Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still 
          could.

     Loretta pulls a bag out of a closet and hands it to 
     Amber.

                    LORETTA (cont'd)
          Here, your ma did want you to have 
          this since your other one got toasted 
          and all.

     Amber pulls out an ELEGANT GREEN GOWN.

                    AMBER
          Oh...my...God!  It's just like Diane 
          Sawyer's!  kCourse it's not a size 
          ten, Diane was a little hippy back 
          then.  Oh, thank you!  Thank you!  
          Thank you!

     She hugs Loretta.

     EXT./INT. HIGH SCHOOL - MAIN ENTRANCE - NIGHT

     SUPER: NIGHT OF THE PAGEANT

     BANNER: "Welcome to the Mount Rose American Teen Princess 
     Pageant, sponsored by Sarah Rose COSMETICS."  The ENTIRE 
     TOWN is excitedly entering.

     CLOSE ON 

     Mr. and Mrs. Howard and their daughter Tina, who's 
     embarrassed and continues to rant as they pass.  All 
     three wear T-shirts with MOLLY'S FACE on them.

                    MR. HOWARD
     
                    MRS. HOWARD
          Go Molly!  Go!  Number one daughter!

     Behind them Leslie Miller's boyfriend, PAT, and a group 
     of ROWDY GUYS approach. 

                    PAT
          Whooo!  Leslie kicks Teen Princess 
          ass!  Go Muskies!

     INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - DAY

     STAGE IS DARK.  Crowd takes their seats.  You can feel 
     the electricity.

     We hear the TAPE of a DRUM ROLL.  SPOTLIGHT hits center 
     stage.  Gladys enters wearing a gaudy gown, takes mic.  
     Applause!

                    GLADYS
          Welcome, welcome.  Okay, alright, now.  
          Is this for me or the gown?

     Laughter and applause trail off.

                    GLADYS (cont'd)
          Welcome to the Mount Rose American 
          Teen Princess Pageant.  While every 
          contestant you'll meet tonight is 
          special and unique, they all have one 
          thing in common.  They're all "Proud - 
          to - be - an - American!"

     Wild applause!  Jazzy patriotic medley tape.  Gym doors 
     fly open and like a Felliniesque Vegas review, 
     CONTESTANTS enter wearing gowns and U.S. Monument 
     Headdresses.  They struggle to maintain balance as they 
     dance, moving only their arms, on stage.

                                        CUT TO:

     Becky, whose head is built like another president into 
     Mount Rushmore, is first at the mic.  (The "dance" 
     continues behind each contestant as she steps up to the 
     mic.)

                    BECKY
          I chose Mount Rushmore, because to 
          live in a country where you can take 
          an ugly old mountain and put faces on 
          it, faces of great Americans, who did 
          so much to make our country super 
          great, well that makes me - Rebecca 
          Leeman - PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!

     INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - MONTAGE

     A MONTAGE of OPENING NUMBER INTRODUCTIONS

     ON LISA SWENSON

     wearing a Statue of Liberty Headdress.  (It's a Barbie 
     Doll that holds an unlit birthday candle.)

                    LISA
          Living in a country where Lady Liberty 
          keeps her flame burning bright.

     She reaches up with a lighter to light the candle. It's 
     hard to reach and won't light.

                    LISA (cont'd)
          Keeps her flame burning bright...

     INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - MONTAGE

     ON LESLIE MILLER

     as she seductively strokes the sides of her Washington 
     Monument Headdress.

                    LESLIE

     Guys WHOOP and CHEER O.S.

                    LESLIE (cont'd)

          ..makes me, Leslie Miller, proud to be 
          an American.

     INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - MONTAGE

     ON AMBER ATKINS

     with a MAP OF THE U.S. HEADDRESS, dances up to the mic.

                    AMBER
          Living in a country where no matter 
          who you are or where you come from, 
          you can grow up and become what you've 
          always dreamed of, makes me, Amber 
          Atkins, proud to be an American!

     INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - MONTAGE

     ON MOLLY HOWARD

     wearing an Atomic Blast at Hiroshima Headdress.

                    MOLLY
          Atomic power makes me, Molly Howard, 
          proud to be an Asian-American.

     As she steps away from the mic, Tess Weinhaus, wearing a 
     huge ball of twine headdress, dances up to the mic.

                    TESS
          Uh, this, uh, my Uncle Phil's World's 
          Largest Ball of Twine, in Bundy 
          Minnesota, makes me, um, it makes me 
          proud I'm American - I kinda 
          misunderstood the assignment.

     The ball of twine falls to the floor and rolls off the 
     stage, still attached at one end to her head.

     BACKSTAGE - DRESSING ROOM

     Pandemonium!  Contestants change into their "Physical 
     Fitness" outfits.  (T-shirts with red flags, shorts) 
     Civil Servettes try to help.  A LARGE PICTURE of Janelle 
     Betz sits at her counter space.

                    IRIS
          Okay, okay!  Listen-up.  Coupla notes 
          from last night's dress rehearsal.
               (off clipboard)
          Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous 
          are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' 
          the "Physical Fitness" routine...

                    AMBER
          Oh my God!  My-my tap costume's gone.

     Commotion stops.  Becky continues to get ready.

                    IRIS
          Uh, Amber?  We're not puttin' on our 
          Talent costumes.  
          You need to put on your "Physical 
          Fitness" outfit.  And let's shake a 
          leg, ladies.

                    AMBER
          No, wait.  It-it was here before the 
          openin' number...wait.  What am I 
          sayin'?  I should just ask you, Becky.  
          Where is it?

     Becky freezes, staring daggers at Amber.

                    BECKY
          What?

                    AMBER
          You heard me.  Where is it?

     The other contestants slowly clear a path between them.

                    BECKY
          If you're gettin' at somethin', you 
          better just say it.

                    AMBER
          I just did.

                    BECKY
          Well then, you better be willin' to 
          back it up, kcause you're talkin' like 
          crazy.

     They start to slowly circle each other - a cat fight's 
     brewin'.

                    AMBER
          Oh-oh, you bring me some of that 
          snotty attitude, Becky - bring it on.

                    BECKY
          Well, as my mother says at Sunday 
          dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!

                    AMBER
          Oh, I'll "get it."  I'll "get it" all 
          right.  I might even take seconds.

     They're moving ever closer...

                    BECKY
          If you want seconds, then I'll make 
          sure it's hot enough for ya.

                    AMBER
          Bitch!

                    IRIS
               (stepping between them)
          Girls!  Girls!

                    BECKY
          Give me your stringy-ass hair!

                    AMBER
          I'll get you!

                    CREW GUY (O.S.)
               (barely audible)
          Oh God, don't stop kem now...

                    BECKY
          You're choking my, you fucking bitch!

                    IRIS
               (putting hand over camera)
          Y'know, I-I don't think yous boys 
          should, uh, should be in here while 
          the girls are changin'.

                    AMBER
          I hate her!

                    IRIS
          We all do.  Now let's go.

     INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM

     Gladys is center stage.

                    GLADYS
          Yah-so how kbout a big round of 
          applause for last year's Mount Rose 
          American Teen Princess, in a farewell 
          performance.  Who could forget her lip-
          synching to "Don't Cry Out Loud," by 
          Melissa Manchester.  And here she is, 
          Mary Johanson!

     Applause!  Gladys exits.  TAPED MUSIC "It's My Turn."  A 
     NURSE pushes MARY JOHANSON out in her wheelchair, 
     complete with portable oxygen.  Mary wears a gigantic 
     black wig and silver gown which hangs off her boney body.  
     She moves her lips to the words as the nurse pushes her 
     emotionally around the stage.

     EXT. GYMNASIUM - HALLWAY

     Contestants, in "physical fitness" outfits, wait outside 
     the double doors, holding freshly painted red, white and 
     blue step ladders.  Becky and Amber stare at each other 
     from opposite ends of the line.

                    IRIS
          All right, why don't we take up the 
          stepladders, all right?  For the 
          Physical Fitness number?

                    BECKY
               (picking up her stool)
          They're wet.

                    LISA
          Hey, my hands are stuck.

                    MOLLY
               (sniffing)
          Uh, I'm kinda dizzy from the fumes.

                    IRIS
          Well, hold kem away from you so it 
          doesn't get on the outfits.
               (turning to Servettes)
          What kinda mental retard paints step 
          ladders the morning of a pageant.

     ON STAGE

     Hank is being pulled off stage by Harold.  Gladys adjusts 
     her dress, frazzled.

                    HANK
               (under throughout)
          Here come the judge - pinch, pinch - 
          here come the judge - pinch, pinch - 
          here come the judge...

                    GLADYS
          Get back!  Get back, you total retard!

                    LORETTA
          Go Hank!

                    GLADYS
          I'm okay, I'm okay - dress is fine.  
          I'm okay...well, our other judges are 
          Jean Kangas and John Dough...

     EXT. GYMNASIUM - HALLWAY

     Iris and Servettes go in the gym as Chloris Klinghagen 
     comes out.

                    CHLORIS
               (loud whisper)
          Opening number looked, uh, good.  
          Solid.  But now you're gonna have to 
          actually dance, so...
               (holds up jar of Vaseline)
          Here.  Put a dab of this on the old 
          choppers, ladies.  It'll help you 
          smile.  And when they're lookin' at 
          your teeth - God willin' - they won't 
          be lookin at your feet.

     Chloris gives Amber the jar and exits.  From the gym, we 
     hear TAPED PATRIOTIC MUSIC.  Contestants CHEER and run 
     in.

     "PHYSICAL FITNESS" ROUTINE - PATRIOTIC MUSIC

     As cuts of patriotic dance moves progress, the girls have 
     more and more red, white and blue paint smeared on their 
     clothes, arms and legs.

     Amber's clearly the best.

     Taped music ENDS.  Contestants, covered with paint, 
     strike a final pose - sitting on ladders, standing, 
     kneeling.  Applause.

     BACKSTAGE - WALKWAY

     Contestants wait anxiously as they pass a can of 
     TURPENTINE and a RAG to remove paint from their arms and 
     legs.

                    BECKY
          Hurry up.

                    LESLIE
          Okay, guys, I think we all got some.  
          You just take it off.

                    AMBER
          Here, I didn't get any.

                    LESLIE
          Here, have some.

                    MICHELLE
          Hand me another white one.

                    LISA
          Listen, you guys, don't go int the 
          bathroom.  Tess blew chunks all over. 
          Man, she ate a big dinner.

                    BECKY
          Maybe she shoulda shoved that lucky 
          bolt down her throat for desert.

     Becky storms off.

                    AMBER
               (sotto, to other girls)
          And the winner of the "Spirit" award 
          goes to...

     Girls laugh quietly.  Iris pulls a dazed and confused 
     Tess - beg wet spot on her shirt - through the shot.

     INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM

     Iris stands center stage, awkwardly holding the mic.

                    IRIS
               (reading from notecard)
          "I'd like to take you back seventeen 
          years, when a peanut farmer was in the 
          White House, a group-a boys callin' 
          themselves kQueen' topped the record 
          charts and Gladys Leeman was Gladys 
          Wood and she was Mount Rose American 
          Teen Princess!"

     Gladys enters wearing sash, tiara and plaid culottes.  
     Applause.  A SLIDE is shown of her at 17.

                    GLADYS
               (taking mic)
          Thank you, thank you.  You know, I won 
          the talent contest by sewing these 
          culottes, Butterick pattern 7-4-3-2.  
          Can you believe it?  They still fit!

                    LORETTA
          She had a big ass then, she's got a 
          big ass now.

                    GLADYS
               (pausing for applause)
          Thank you, thank you.  
          Our next eontestant is ready, so let's 
          welcome her: Tess Weinhaus!

     APPLAUSE.  Tess is pushed on stage.

     BACKSTAGE - LEFT

     Amber paces.  ON STAGE Tess drones on at the mic.

                    TESS
               (in the b.g. throughout)
          The beagle is known for it's howl.  
          "Aaauuuuuhhhh."  The Pekinese has it's 
          own distinctive bark.  "Yip, yip, 
          yip."  Not to be confused with the 
          Chihuahua's, "Yap, yap, yap."  But 
          none can compare to the greatest bark 
          of all - the German Shepherd...

                    AMBER
               (to camera, loud whisper)
          ...Yah-it's just gone...
               (eyes welling up)
          I mean, I-I just wanna tap, y'know?  
          I'm not sayin' I'm the best, or that 
          I'd even win, but shouldn't I at least 
          get a chance to compete?
               (starting to sob)
          I just wanted my Mom to see me dance.

     CHLORIS KLINGHAGEN enters, small bag in hand.

                    CHLORIS
               (loud whisper)
          Amber - Amber, c'mere.

                    AMBER
          Please, Mrs. K, I got so much Vaseline 
          on my teeth, I'm gonna be smilin' for 
          a year.

                    CHLORIS
          No.  Here.

     Chloris pulls a simple BLACK LEOTARD from the bag.

                    CHLORIS (cont'd)
          It's nothin' special, but talent like 
          yours doesn't need to hide behind 
          sequins.

                    AMBER
          Mrs. K--

                    CHLORIS
          You're... you're special and... Ah 
          hell, go out there and kick some 
          Leeman ass.

     Amber, overcome with joy, gives her a big hug.

                    CHLORIS (cont'd)
          Not so hard, sweetie.  I heard 
          somethin' snap...

     INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM

     ON STAGE: Leslie Miller, in uniform, performs an 
     amazingly sexy cheer as TWO SINGLET-CLAD WRESTLERS 
     wrestle (One is boyfriend, Pat.).

                    LESLIE
          Roll him over --
               (clap, clap, clap)
          Lay him flat
               (clap, clap, clap)
          Pin his shoulders
               (clap, clap, clap)
          To the mat
               (clap, clap, clap)
          Roll him over, lay him flat, pin his 
          shoulders, to the mat!  Yeahhhh!

     She JUMPS, KICKS and ends with SPLITS.  APPLAUSE!

                                        JUMP CUT TO:

     INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - LATER

     Michelle Johanson is on stage, sitting on a stool, 
     wearing all black.  She smiles warmly.  Then, with one 
     sweep of her hand across her face, her smile drops.  
     She's dead serious.

                    MICHELLE
               (without emotion)
          Fade in...Earth.  The year is two-
          thousand twenty-four.  The question on 
          everyone's mind:  What is...Soylent 
          Green?

     She sweeps her hand back across her face and she's "in 
     character," pained, near death, and overly dramatic.

     BACKSTAGE - LEFT - CONTINUOUS

     Amber, now in the leotard, talks to Iris.  Michelle 
     performs from "Soylent Green" in the b.g.

                    AMBER
               (loud whisper)
          Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to 
          me?  Why're you pretendin' you don't 
          know what's goin' on?

                    IRIS
          Amber, I'm sorry.  I really am.  But 
          you know the rules.  All talent 
          costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys 
          before the pageant.

                    AMBER
          But, doesn't someone taking your 
          costume so you can't compete, overrule 
          that rule?

                    IRIS
          Sorry.  I-I don't make the rules.

                    AMBER
          This, this... This is bullshit!

                    IRIS
          Amber Atkins!  That is not American 
          Teen Princess language!

                    AMBER
          Good, kcause this isn't an American 
          Teen Princess Pageant - it's, it's 
          Nazi Germany!

     Amber storms off.

                    IRIS
               (shaking head)
          Where do they get this stuff...

     INT. BACKSTAGE

     CAMERA FOLLOWS AMBER as she storms over to BACKSTAGE - 
     RIGHT where Gladys watches Michelle ON STAGE.

                    AMBER
          Mrs. Leeman?

                    GLADYS
               (turning)
          Huh?

                    AMBER
          I-I'm wearin' this costume.  I'm, uh, 
          I'm gonna do my talent tonight.

                    GLADYS
          Oh really - I don't think so.
               (suddenly aware of camera)
          Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of 
          bad news, but rules state that a 
          costume must be okay'd at least a week 
          in advance.  And this...
               (pointing to costume)
          This is why we have the rule.  My 
          goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a 
          neckline this low on stage.  We have 
          kids in the audience.

                    AMBER
          But, you - I mean... It's not my 
          fault.  I-I... Please?  I didn't do 
          anything wrong...

     Amber starts to cry.

                    MICHELLE
               (climaxing)
          That's why... I must say...
               (raising arm upward)
          Soylent Green... is... people.

     She doubles over.  She's given it all.  APPLAUSE.

                    GLADYS
          Oops, that's my cue.

     Gladys starts out on stage as Molly Howard, dressed like 
     a red, white and blue cowboy, runs up next to Amber.  
     She's twirling toy guns on her fingers.

                    MOLLY
          Wish me luck.

                    AMBER
               (drying her eyes)
          Good luck, Molly.

     One of Molly's guns flies off her finger.  She goes to 
     retrieve it.

     INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM

     Molly is line dancing, occasionally taking "pretend" 
     shots into the air.  It's incredibly repetitive and dull.

     BACKSTAGE - CARL'S "LIGHT AND SOUND" BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

     As Billy Ray Cyrus' "Achy Breaky Heart" PLAYS in b.g., 
     Carl, the janitor, sets plastic army figures on fire with 
     a cigarette lighter.

     INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM

     Gladys is center stage.  Molly Howard walks off crying, 
     having just finished her routine.  POLITE APPLAUSE.  
     She's still spinning her guns, again one goes flying.

                    GLADYS
          Thank you, Molly.

     INT. HIGH SCHOOL/STAIRWELL - DRESSING AREA

     Lisa, top hat, tails, giant "I LOVE NY" button - and 
     others try to console a CRYING Amber.  Becky continues 
     singing O.S.

                    LISA
               (arm around Amber)
          Oh, Amber...

                    AMBER
               (can't catch breath)
          I-I-I-I-I-, j-uh-j-uh-just wanted to 
          compe-e-e-e-ete.

                    LISA
          I can't believe this is happenin'.  I 
          can't believe she said you couldn't...

     Getting an idea, Lisa starts to take off her jacket.

                    LISA (cont'd)
          Amber?  Here.

                    AMBER
               (still sobbing)
          "Here," wh-wh-what?

                    LISA
          My jacket.  Take it kcause, y'know, I 
          got my costume okay'd before the 
          pageant.  You can wear it.

                    MICHELLE
          Oh man, Lisa, I wouldn't do this.

                    LESLIE
               (to Lisa)
          They're never gonna let you perform 
          naked.  I asked.

                    LISA
          Shut up, yous guys.  Look, Amber, I'm 
          not gonna win.  And let's be honest, a 
          family only needs one "Liza" and you 
          know Peter's got much better legs than 
          me.

                    AMBER
          Your parents'd kill you.

                    LISA
          Oh c'mon, I love kem, but you know 
          they only had me kcause Peter needed a 
          kidney.

                    AMBER
          Lis, I want to, I really do, but... 
          Oh, I can't.

                    LISA
          Then do it for Peter.  Mrs. Leeman 
          used to call him a "skinny little fag" 
          when he'd bag her groceries.  He'd pop 
          his Nancy-belt if his old jacket 
          somehow, I don't know, got her back.

                    AMBER
          Yah?

                    LISA
          Oh-you-beccha.

     Amber hugs her and takes the jacket.

     INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - STAGE

     Gladys guides Molly off the stage.

                    GLADYS
          Now, it's with overwhelming pride that 
          I introduce contestant number six, who 
          also happens to be president of her 
          class - two years running - a member 
          of the honor roll and the new 
          President of the Lutheran Sisterhood 
          Gun Club - Rebecca Ann Leeman!

     STAGE GOES BLACK.  SPOT HITS BECKY, who sits at the edge 
     of the stage, holding a mic.  She's head to toe sequins 
     in her poodle skirt, sweater, saddle shoes, etc. 

                    BECKY
               (talking over music)
          I don't know how many of you know 
          this, but I've got a very special 
          fella in my life - that's right, I 
          do... And if nobody minds, I'd like to 
          sing a little song, just for him.

     SPOT FOLLOWS as Becky stands and walks center stage to 
     what appears to be a COVERED MANNEQUIN.  TAPED INTRO TO 
     "I Can't Take My Eyes Off You."

                    BECKY (cont'd)
          You're just too good to be true.  
          Can't take my eyes off of you.  You'd 
          be like Heaven to touch.  I wanna hold 
          you so much.  At long last love has 
          arrived and I thank God I'm alive.  

     Becky removes the sheet, revealing a MANNEQUIN dressed 
     like JESUS as he appeared on the cross: long hair, beard, 
     crown of thorns, loincloth.  The ARMS ARE STUFFED so they 
     move freely.  (Hands of stigmata.)

                    BECKY (cont'd)
          You're just to good to be true.  Can't 
          take my eyes off of you...

     Becky TALK-SINGS - a la William Shatner's "Rocket Man" - 
     and DANCES around the Jesus mannequin doing the jitter-
     bug, the twist and a slow dance (his arms on her 
     shoulders).

     DURING THE SLOW DANCE, THE LOIN CLOTH SLIPS AND BECKY 
     MUST HOLD IT UP - GIVING THE APPEARANCE OF GRABBING HIS 
     CROTCH.

     INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - BACKSTAGE

     Iris approaches Lisa who's given her outfit to Amber.

                    IRIS
          C'mon, Lisa.  You're up next.

                    LISA
          I quit.  And, uh, since my costume, 
          y'know, was okay'd a month ago?  I'm 
          givin' it to Amber.

     Amber breaks a smile.

     Taped music ENDS.  APPLAUSE.  Gladys, mic in hand, joins 
     Becky for a big hug.

                    GLADYS
          Boy, I'd hate to follow that.  Wow!

     Becky exits, pulling the wheeled Jesus behind her.

                    GLADYS (cont'd)
          Voice of an angel, that one.

     Iris runs self-consciously out on stage, whispers in 
     Gladys' ear, then runs back off stage.

                    GLADYS (cont'd)
          ...Uh, I was just told that contestant 
          number seven, Lisa Swenson, has quite 
          the pageant.

     CROWD REACTS.

                    GLADYS (cont'd)
          Well, these things happen.  At any 
          rate, we still have one more 
          contestant - number eight, Amber 
          Atkins.

     Gladys exits.  A taped hip, hot DRUM BEAT starts.  
     Suddenly, Amber glides into CENTER SPOT.  (Now wearing 
     Lisa's costume, sleeves rolled up.)  Her feet burst into 
     an amazing routine.  The loud drum beats seem to fly from 
     her hands and feet as they punctuate the rhythm.  There's 
     no glitz, just unbelievable skill.  It appears effortless 
     as she floats around stage.  Like watching Michael 
     Jackson moon walk for the first time, you can't take your 
     eyes off her.  She concludes, center stage, with the 
     GREATEST THIRTY SECONDS OF HER LIFE.  The audience goes 
     WILD!  Amber takes bow after bow - they love her.  Gladys 
     enters quickly, mic in hand.

                    GLADYS (cont'd)
          Okay, okay, okay!  Well, now, it's 
          finally time to say good-bye to our 
          judges, so they can go make the 
          toughest decision of their lives.

     PAN TO JUDGES.  They look nervous as hell.  A relaxed 
     Hank sniffs from a paint soaked bag.

     INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CLASS ROOM - NIGHT

     Judges stare nervously at the camera - clip boards in 
     front of them.  Hank's LOUD BREATHING from the paint 
     soaked bag is obviously getting on John's nerves.

                    DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)
          So who get's the crown?  How are you 
          going to figure this all out?

                    JOHN
          Uh, we're gonna, y'know, compare 
          scores and uh, figure out a-a winner.  
          kCause we don't know the winner yet... 
          I mean, I-I don't know who Jean and 
          Harold picked.  No idea.  Did Gladys 
          send you in here?

                    HANK
          I know the winner!  I know the winner!  
          I know the winner!

                    JOHN
          No you don't!  Shut your goddamn 
          mouth, you son-of-a-bitch!!

     Nerves shot, John suddenly LAUNCHES himself across the 
     table at Hank.

                    HAROLD
          Wait a second.

                    JOHN
          You shut it!  You goddamn retard!

     Hank freezes, then starts to wail!

                    HANK
          EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE!

                    HAROLD
          Come on!  Hankey here can't help it if 
          he was born crazier than a shithouse 
          rat!

     Hank stops crying and goes back to the bag.

                    JOHN
          For fuck's sake, why didn't ya leave 
          him with a sitter?

     Hank begins crying again.

                    HAROLD
          Real nice.  You know the sitter's 
          dead.

                                        DISSOLVE TO:

     BACKSTAGE - DRESSING ROOM

     Girls, in gowns, sit in silence.  Becky and Amber sit at 
     opposite ends of the room.  There's obvious tension.

                    LESLIE
          So, anyone talk to Janelle?

                    AMBER
          Yah-I brought her some flowers this 
          morning.  She's in the room next to my 
          mom.  She's super happy.

     Girls ad-lib SHOCK.

                    TESS
          She's happy?

                    LESLIE
          Why happy?

                    AMBER (cont'd)
          Oh -- the blow to her head made her 
          deaf...

     Girls ad-lib "Oh, I see.  Okay-then." etc.  Another LONG 
     BEAT of SILENCE follows.  Becky gets up to re-touch her 
     make-up.

                    BECKY
               (losing it)
          Oh, good Lord!  What're they doin'?  
          Lettin' the retard count votes?!

     Contestants stare at her in shock.  Iris enters.

                    IRIS
          It's time, ladies.

     INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM

     Judges are back.  Gladys is center stage.  Girls enter 
     and form a line behind her.  TAPED AMERICAN MEDLEY 
     STARTS.

                    GLADYS
          Welcome back, everyone.  Judges.  Our 
          Second Runner-up and winner of a fifty-
          
     Taped fanfare.  Leslie bounds forward, grabs her trophy, 
     stands to one side.  

                    PAT (O.S.)
          You rule, Leslie!

     Audience laughs.  Leslie waves.

                    GLADYS
          Our next prize, a seventy-five dollar 
          scholarship --

     Audience ad-libs amazement.

                    GLADYS (cont'd)
          ...will be awarded to the First Runner-
          up.

     Taped DRUM ROLL.  Contestants (except Becky) take hands.  
     Iris gives Gladys an envelope and trophy.

                    GLADYS (cont'd)
          And the First Runner-up is -
               (opening envelope, face 
               drops)
          Contestant number eight, Amber Atkins.

     Ad-lib audience shock and disbelief.  Contestants are 
     stunned.  Amber steps forward, humbly takes the trophy 
     and stands beside Leslie.  Audience finally quiets.

                    GLADYS (cont'd)
          And finally, the moment I know I've 
          been waiting for...

     Iris hands Gladys a LARGE TROPHY and envelope.  Mary 
     Johanson is wheeled out wearing sash and tiara.

                    GLADYS (cont'd)
          With a scholarship of five-hundred 
          dollars, courtesy Leeman Furniture, 
          and all expenses paid for next weekend 
          when she'll be competin' for the title 
          of Minnesota American Teen Princess...

     Taped drum roll.  Gladys opens the envelope.

                    GLADYS (cont'd)
          Our new Mount Rose American Teen 
          Princess is contestant number - ah 
          heck, she's my daughter - number 
          seven, Rebecca Ann Leeman!

     Polite audience applause.  Becky rushes forward.  Gladys 
     RIPS the tiara and sash off Mary, places them on Becky.

                    BECKY
          Oh, thank you so much!

     AUDIENCE

     Loretta and Annette watch on.

                    ANNETTE
          Shit.

     INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - STAGE

     The ELDERLY MAN/MAYOR, from earlier scene, enters and 
     sings to a tape as Becky takes her victory walk.

                    ELDERLY MAN/MAYOR
               (tune of "Miss America")
          "Here she is, Our Mount Rose American 
          Teen Princess.  Look at her, doesn't 
          she look fine.  Our hearts swell big, 
          as we look at her.  Our Mount Rose 
          American Teen Princess."

     EXT./INT. HIGH SCHOOL - LATER

     AMBULANCE pulls up.  Mary Johanson, unconscious, slumped 
     in wheelchair, is brought out and put in.  Amber and 
     Loretta wheel Annette out.  Paramedics put her in, too.

                    ANNETTE
          We was robbed.

                    LORETTA
          Okay.  Take her purse.

                    AMBER
          Bye mom.

                    ANNETTE
          We was robbed.

                    AMBER
          It's okay.

     EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

     Amber faces camera as ambulance pulls away.

                    AMBER
          Oh, Mom's okay.  They're just givin' 
          her a ride back.  She almost blew 
          outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on 
          the way over.

                    LORETTA
          Thank God for bunge cords.

     EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

                    AMBER
               (tearing up)
          ...Yah-well, at least, y'know, I got 
          to perform.  And Mom got to see me.
               (crying)
          I guess number eight only worked for 
          Diane Sawyer...

     Loretta puts her arm around Amber.  They walk off as 
     Leslie and Pat approach.

                    LESLIE
          Hey-hey, I'm Second Runner-up!  Whooo!  
          I got second place!

                    PAT
          Third.

                    LESLIE
          Huh?

     Lisa passes by with her parents.  They look pissed.

                    LISA
          No, it was worth it.  Amber shoulda 
          won.

                    LISA'S FATHER
          I'll tell ya one thing.  Peter never 
          woulda pulled a shenanigan like that.

                    LISA
          Well, y'know what, dad?  Y'know what?  
          Peter's gay!

     She runs off.  Her parents stop DEAD IN THEIR TRACKS.

                    LISA'S FATHER
          What?!

     INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CLASS ROOM - NIGHT

     CLOSE ON BECKY'S FACE.  Flashes illuminate it.  With each 
     photo she changes her smile and expression.  She loves 
     this.

     PULL BACK to reveal two older men, with old-style news 
     cameras, flash pictures.

                    DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)
          So, how does it feel to be the new 
          Mount Rose American Teen Princess, 
          Becky?

     OLDER MEN turn and look at camera, then take out a pen 
     and note pad.

                    BECKY
          Well, it's all happenin' so fast.  
          Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems 
          real, y'know?  I mean, I won!  I'm the 
          winner!  I'm going to State!

                    GLADYS
          She's the winner and we're going to 
          state.

     INT. MOUNT ROSE HIGH - GIRL'S BATHROOM - DAY

     Fry Girl #1 and Pregnant Fry Girl smoke.

                    FRY GIRL #1
          What a surprise.  Gladys Leeman's 
          finally gonna go to State.  
          And she'll probably ride on Becky's 
          ass all the way to Nationals, too.

                    PREGNANT FRY GIRL
          I wonder how she's gonna fix that one. 

                    DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)
          Are you ladies going to the parade 
          tomorrow?

                    PREGNANT FRY GIRL
          Nah.  I think I'm like, due or 
          somethin'.

     MOUNT ROSE MAIN STREET - NEXT DAY

     Beautiful sunny day.  Lester talks to camera.

                    LESTER
          Ahhh.  Beautiful as a whore's ass 
          today.  Eh, boys?

     In the b.g., Gladys holds a bullhorn, clipboard and 
     points to a LARGE SWAN FLOAT.

                    GLADYS
               (into bullhorn)
          Hey!  Turn that float around.  You 
          think a swan's gonna swim ass first up 
          Main Street?

                    LESTER
          Yah-Gladys had me order that swan 
          special made from Mexico (Me'hee'koe) 
          in case Becky won.  I do a lotta 
          business with those people.  I always 
          offer to pay kem in tacos.
               (laughing)
          Whoo, they love that.

     EXT. MOUNT ROSE MAIN STREET - LATER

     Entire town lines the road.  The Mayor and the Leman 
     family stand behind the red ribbon.  Parade PARTICIPANTS 
     are lined up behind them.

                    MAYOR
               (into bullhorn)
          Yah-hello-hello...shit!  How the fuck 
          do ya work this damn thing, huh?  Oh.  
          Welcome to our first ever American 
          Teen Princess Parade - which also 
          happens to be the unveiling of our new 
          sewer system!

     CHEERS!  Becky cuts the ribbon.  More CHEERS!

                    MAYOR (cont'd)
          Yah-so, while Becky gets on her float, 
          then, any questions kbout the new 
          sewer?  Yah, Clem?

     EXT. MOUNT ROSE MAIN STREET - LATER

     THE PASSING PARADE:

     - THREE FAT VETS, dressed as the Revolutionary War trio, 
     hold American, Minnesota and POW/MIA flags.

     - TWO BATON TWIRLERS stand in front of the Mount Rose 
     High School Band.  They play - way off key.

     - JUDGES wave from a convertible.  Hank, in passenger's 
     seat, struggles to get out.  His seatbelt prevents it.

     - TWO GRUNGY OLD CLOWNS smoke impatiently.

     - TWO FAT WHITE MEN, dressed as Indians, sit on scooters.

     - FAT MAN drives a riding lawnmower, pulling a flatbed 
     with A SPEEDBOAT and a FISHING CAMP GROUP.

     - FARMER pulls a goat with a sign: "Milk Me for $1.00"

     - A BRIGADE of tap dancing BASSOONISTS.

     EXT. MOUNT ROSE - STREET

     Harold and Hank pull over and park their truck.  Harold 
     quickly gets out, obviously in a hurry, slamming on a 
     pouting Hank.

                    HAROLD
          Let's get this straight right now.  We 
          wouldn't have been late at all if it 
          wasn't for you. 

                    HANK
          I want to have the big bag of little 
          donuts.

                    HAROLD
          You get nothing, Hank, okay?

                    HANK
          I want to get the big bag of little 
          donuts.

                    HAROLD
          There's your paint can.  The next time 
          you drink window cleaner, I'm just 
          gonna leave it in ya.

     Harold rushes off for the parade, joining other folks 
     carrying baskets, lawn chairs and flags on the sidewalk.  

                                        JUMP CUT TO:

     EXT. MOUNT ROSE STREET - BACK TO DOCUMENTARY CAMERA

     PAN OVER to see Gladys helping Becky climb on the swan, 
     unaware of camera.  In b.g., DOCUMENTARY CREW interviews 
     Amber and Leslie on their convertible behind the swan 
     float.

                    GLADYS
          C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it.  Now 
          get up there.  Ride it side-saddle if 
          you have to - like a horse.  C'mon, 
          now.

                    BECKY
          It smells funny.  Like gasoline.

                    GLADYS
          Oh for chrissakes, everything smells 
          like that in Mexico.

                    BECKY
          My dress'll reek.

                    GLADYS
          Listen, little missy, this cost your 
          dad a pretty penny.  Now get your ass 
          up there and show me some teeth.

     EXT. MOUNT ROSE MAIN STREET - LATER

     Amber and Leslie, in gowns, look unhappy as they stare 
     straight ahead, exhaust fumes - that appear to come from 
     the swan's ass - cover them and their old convertible.

                    LESLIE
          Amber, if I die from these fumes, will 
          you be sure to cover the hickies on my 
          neck?

                    AMBER
          Yeah...

                    LESLIE
          And the bite marks on my ears?

                    AMBER
               (slowly turning)
          Yes...

                    LESLIE
          I know it doesn't matter, but on my 
          inner thighs.

                    AMBER
          Yes, Leslie!

     EXT. MOUNT ROSE MAIN STREET - LATER

     Hank rubs his head, then angrily gets out of the truck, 
     SLAMMING THE DOOR ON ONE OF THE SUSPENDERS ON HIS 
     OVERALLS.  He starts to walk, but can't, eventually 
     leaning out from the truck - only moving his arms as if 
     walking.

     EXT. MOUNT ROSE SIDE STREET - LATER

     Hank, still stuck in the door, is being teased by a GROUP 
     OF KIDS who poke at him with flags and sticks.  ANOTHER 
     LITTLE KID taunts him with his cotton candy - keeping it 
     just out of his reach.  Hank bats at them like 
     Frankenstein and the torch wielding townsfolk.

     EXT. MOUNT ROSE SIDE STREET - LATER

     Hank, still stuck in the door, holds the little kid by 
     the back of the shirt in one hand and eats the kid's 
     cotton candy with the other.  The kid struggles to get 
     away.  A few BROKEN FLAGS are scattered on the ground.

                    HANK
          Help...Hank!  Help...Hank!  
          Help...Hank!  Help...Hank!

     ON SWAN FLOAT.  Gladys approaches.

                    GLADYS
          Okay, I designed the float, you know.  
          And, what's gonna happen here is that 
          this is going to look like a 
          glistening lake beneath the swan.

                    IRIS
          Uh, Gladys?

                    GLADYS
          What!

                    IRIS
          We need more bars!

                    GLADYS
          This is -- what?

                    IRIS
          Enid ate a whole pan!

                    GLADYS
          I swear to God she can't do anything 
          by herself.

     EXT. MOUNT ROSE MAIN STREET - LATER

                    AMBER
               (to camera)
          Oh-yah, this is exactly how I pictured 
          it.  Chokin' on swan gas.

     Suddenly, like a gasoline soaked pinata, it EXPLODES!

     Gladys is thrown back.  Flames.  Screaming.  PANDEMONIUM!  
     Becky doesn't have a chance.  She's a pink taffeta BALL 
     OF FIRE.  The swan's back eventually collapses taking 
     Becky into it's burning belly. 

     INTERCUT WITH MR. HOWARD'S VIDEO.

     Gladys watches in stunned silence as her daughter and 
     only chance at State go up in flames.  Suddenly, she 
     CRACKS!

                    GLADYS
          Oh my God!  My Baby!  The swan ate my 
          baby!
               (grabbing at burning float)
          Ow-ow-ow!  Get up, Rebecca!  Get outta 
          there!  We've gotta go to State!  Oh 
          hot!
               (she scorches her blouse)
          Oh, damn.  I like this blouse.  
          Rebecca!  Get up, angel face.  Time to 
          go to State!  Ow-ow-ow!

     Eventually, Gladys tries to climb up on the float.  Iris 
     pulls her off.

                    GLADYS (cont'd)
          Get offa me, you cow!

     Gladys spins and notices the silent CROWD.

                    GLADYS (cont'd)
          What're you lookin' at?  Huh?  A whole 
          God Damn town of losers!  That's what 
          I'm lookin' at!

     Crowd reacts.  Gladys notices Amber and runs up to her 
     car.

                    GLADYS (cont'd)
          You!  You piece-a-shit trailer trash!  
          This shoulda been you!  Damn, I 
          shoulda killed you when I had the 

     The crows reacts again.  Gladys spins, noticing someone.  
     Lester approaches.

                    GLADYS (cont'd)
          Hey, Ted, sorry.  I didn't know your 
          family was in the garage when I set it 
          on fire!

                    LESTER
          Gladys!  Stop it!

                    GLADYS
          Guess it wasn't a garage sale as much 
          as it was a bake sale.  Ah-
          hahahahahahahaha!

     Lester tries to pull her away from the crowd.

                    GLADYS (cont'd)
          Let go-a-me, you old bastard!

     She grabs a BURNING 2X4 off a float and starts swinging 
     it.

                    GLADYS (cont'd)
          At least you've got another daughter.

     CROWD GASPS.  Then stunned SILENCE.  CAMERA CIRCLES 
     Gladys and Lester getting reaction shots of the crowd.

                    LESTER
          So help me, Gladys.

                    GLADYS
          Becky was my only shot at state!

                    LESTER
          That's enough!

                    GLADYS
          Let go!  Let go of me.  Oh my God, 
          it's COPS!

     TWIN OFFICERS, followed by "COPS" TV CREW, run up and 
     aggressively tackle Gladys.  As the struggle on the 
     ground continues, crew guys go over and shake hands with 
     the "COPS" crew - obviously knowing them.

                    GLADYS (cont'd)
               (pointing to Lester)
          He sells reproductions!  His 
          furniture's as fake as my orgasms!

     The COPS crew begins to mingle with the DOCUMENTARY crew.

                    SCOTT
          Hey, man, how're you doin'?

                    DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)
          Hi!  What's up, Scott?  You remember 
          Bruce, right?

                    SCOTT
          Long time, no see.

                    DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)
          Bruce, that's Roy.
               (they shake hands)
          Roy, Bruce.

     EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY

     Lovely hillside.  A PASTOR and TOWN FOLK - heads bowed - 
     stand beside a FRESH GRAVE.

                    PASTOR
          That's why, dear Lord, it's with such 
          great sorrow that we turn over to you 
          a young woman whose dream of ridin' on 
          a giant swan brought about her 
          untimely death.  Maybe it's your way 
          of telling us to buy American.

     EXT. GRAVEYARD - LATER

     The funeral is over.  Amber, Loretta, Iris and Servettes 
     awkwardly face each other beside the grave.  Iris takes 
     the PARTIALLY MELTED TIARA from the headstone.

                    IRIS
          As, uh, actin' President of the Mount 
          Rose Civil Servettes, it's my duty 
          since Becky can't fulfill her duties - 
          kcause she's dead-n-all - to make you 
          Mount Rose American Teen Princess.

     She puts the TIARA on AMBER.  Loretta FLASHES pictures.

                    MALE REPORTER #1
          Turn around and let me see.

     EXT. GRAVEYARD - LATER

     Annette, Amber (wearing her tiara) and Loretta are 
     leaving the crowning ceremony.  All are happy as they 
     push an extremely drugged Annette out of the cemetery.

                    LORETTA
          What is wrong with you?

                    AMBER
          I don't know.  I just didn't wanna win 
          like this.

                    LORETTA
          You stop right there.  You are a good 
          person.  Good things happen to good 
          people.

                    AMBER
          Really?

                    LORETTA
          No.  It's pure bullshit, sweetie.  
          You're lucky as hell, so you might as 
          well enjoy it.  Let's get you a root 
          beer float.

                    AMBER
          Okay.

                    LORETTA
          Do you guys want some shots?  I'm 
          buyin'.

     EXT. LORETTA'S TRAILER - DAY

     Amber sits on the picnic table.  In the b.g., Loretta 
     exits her trailer with a FED-EX GUY.  She pats his buns 
     as he exits.  She approaches Amber with a packet.

                    AMBER (V.O.)
          I never liked her, but she didn't 
          deserve to die in the belly of a swan 
          like that.  The whole thing's just 
          kinda sad and lame at the same time.

                    LORETTA
               (handing over packet)
          This came for you, sweetie.

                    AMBER
          Ah!  It's from State!  Oh my God!

     Amber rips it open and holds up a color brochure with 
     COLLEEN and TERRY in a glamour shot on the cover.

                    AMBER (cont'd)
               (paging through packet)
          It's all the stuff I get to do.  Oh my 
          God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get 
          a "personal consultation" with a make-
          up artist -- Eeeh!  Okay, um, there'll 
          be a choreographer to the stars and, 
          oh no -- No way.  Oh... My... God!

                    LORETTA
          What?  For chrissakes, spit it out.

                    AMBER
          I'll be stayin' overnight at... The 
          Airport Howard Johnsons!

                    LORETTA
          Right by the airport - Oh, Amber...

                    AMBER
          There's an indoor swimming pool!  
          Ahhhh!

     Loretta joins in the screaming.

                    AMBER (cont'd)
          Oh crap - I only got four days.  I 
          gotta practice!

     EXT. LORETTA'S TRAILER - MORNING

     MONTAGE BEGINS over MUSIC.

     Amber emerges from Loretta's trailer, Pop Tart in mouth, 
     book bag in hand.  SMILES.  WAVES.

     EXT. TRAILER PARK

     Taps her way down the road, out of the trailer park.

     INT. CAFETERIA - MONTAGE

     Amber scrapes trays.  PAN DOWN.  She wears tap shoes, 
     practices her routine.

     INT. HOSPITAL - MONTAGE - DAY

     Amber walks around the room in high heels, balancing a 
     bedpan on her head.

     INT. MORTUARY - MONTAGE

     Amber dances around the room, using a suit on a hanger as 
     a partner.  A naked old man is on the embalming slab, a 
     sheet covering his nasties.

     EXT. LORETTA'S TRAILER - NIGHT

     In silhouette, Amber taps on the picnic table by the 
     light of the FULL HARVEST MOON.

                                        DIP TO BLACK:

     EXT. AIRPORT HOWARD JOHNSONS - DAY

     WHITE LETTERS ON BLACK: "STATE FINALS"

     We look up at the towering Howard Johnsons and see a huge 
     banner which reads: "WELCOME AMERICAN TEEN PRINCESS, 
     FRIED CLAM PLATTER $9.99." Suddenly, a 747, not more than 
     thirty feet above the hotel, flies over - the sound is 
     deafening.

                    LORETTA
          All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."

                    AMBER
          Airport Ho-Jo!

                    LORETTA
          I got it!  Yeah, why don't ya take a 
 
     Mr. Larson unloads Amber's luggage from the hearse.  
     Loretta leans against it, arm around Amber, smoking and 
     occasionally flipping off people who stop to stare at 
     this unusual sight.

                    AMBER
          Loretta, don't do that.

                    LORETTA
          I'm sorry.  They're just starin'.

                    AMBER
          I gotta work with these women.

                    LORETTA
          Okay, sweetie, that's all right.  
          Let's go.  Let's go.

     INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - BAR AREA

     There's a fake tropical look, with loads of plastic 
     palms, etc.  CAMERA FOLLOWS Amber into area.  BANNER: 
     "STATE FINALS - SPONSORED BY THE MINNESOTA MODELING 
     ACADEMY" Contestants (25) sit at tables, they seem more 
     mature, more professional.  Amber smiles and gives a 
     little wave.  Terry approaches Amber.

                    TERRY
          And you are...

                    AMBER
          Mount Rose American Teen Princess.

                    TERRY
          Funny, you don't look dead.

          Okay?

                    COLLEEN
          Mm-hm.

     INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - BAR AREA

     Loretta, seated at the bar, puts her arm around a man 
     next to her.

                    LORETTA
          So...you're cute.  Oh, I see you're 
          married.
               (to bartender)
          You catch this in your mouth, I'll 
          give you a present.  All right?  Open 
          wide...
               (she throws the olive)
          Oh, God, you got that on the first 
          try.  Come here.

     Loretta kisses the bartender.

                    LORETTA (cont'd)
          You are cute.

     INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - COURTYARD STAGE AREA - DAY

                    TERRY
          Due to budgetary cutbacks - and the 
          fact that Nationals didn't cough up a 
          damn nickel this year - you won't be 
          stayin' overnight.  So pay attention, 
          you've got about eight hours until 
          showtime.

     INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - STAGE AREA - DAY

     A DISCO BEAT POUNDS from a boom box.  Mr. Melchoir, the 
     choreographer, watches contestants move in fast-paced 
     crisscrossing formations.  Amber is among them.  Miss St. 
     Paul screws up.

                    MR. MELCHOIR
          Remember to count, ladies.  Cross on 
          the left and arms up on eight!  On the 
          beat!  On the beat!  Keep on it!  Keep 
          movin' it!  C'mon, Miss Forest Lake, 
          take that stick out of your ass or I 
          will.  All right.  Very nice.  Now 
          come on, arms out.  We're in the front 
          row.  Come on, sell it!  That's very 
          nice.  Remember, figure eights, 
          ladies...

     INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - BAR AREA - MOMENTS LATER

     Colleen and Terry smoke and drink at a tall tiki table 
     that's covered with empties.  In the b.g., a pageant 
     worker passes out PINK BAGS to the contestants.  All the 
     while, TWO FAT KIDS play "Marco Polo" in the pool.

                    COLLEEN
               (tipsy, holding up glass)
          I can sum up our entire philosophy 
          with this glass.  I look at it and 
          say, "it's half full."  Which, in the 
          beauty pageant biz means, "Where the 
          hell's my waiter!"

     She laughs hard, then spins around in her chair.

                    COLLEEN (cont'd)
               (screaming)
          Stop with the fuckin' Marco-Polo 
          before I rip your fat little heads 
          off!

     INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - STAGE AREA - AUDIENCE CHAIRS

     A very mature Miss Burnsville talks to Amber who is 
     staring at Miss Burnsville's supernaturally well-
     supported chest.

                    MR. MELCHOIR
          Miss Burnsville, you're up next...

                                        JUMP CUT TO:

     INT. STAGE AREA - AUDIENCE CHAIRS - MOMENTS LATER

     Amber sits addressing the camera.  Miss Burnsville is 
     gone.

                    AMBER
          Don't tell anyone, but, I have a 
          little secret weapon of my own.

     Amber pulls out a jar of Vaseline from her purse and 
     smiles innocently.

     INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - BAR AREA - SHELLFISH BUFFET - DAY

     Contestants hungrily fill their plates with seafood.

     INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - BAR AREA - SHELLFISH BUFFET

     Amber stands beside the buffet, holding only a salad.

                    AMBER
          I don't eat shellfish.  Mom always 
          says, "Don't ever eat nothin' that can 
          carry its house around with it - who 
          knows the last time it's been 
          cleaned."  She should know.

     INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - BAR AREA

     Amber eats at a tall tiki table with Miss Minneapolis.

                    MISS MINNEAPOLIS
          ... I've done about thirty-five 
          pageants.  I guess my most memorable 
          one'd have to be Miss Teen America, 
          1995.  It was in Vegas.  My roommate 
          did Adam West.

     SUPER: MR. WEST WAS UNAVAILABLE FOR COMMENT

                    MISS MINNEAPOLIS (cont'd)
          She said he was sooo horny.

     Amber stares at her with wide-eyed disbelief.

                                        JUMP CUT TO:

     INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - STAGE AREA - DAY

     Amber watches four contestants in a row practice their 
     talents.  All are equally amazing.  
     "THEME from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY" starts.  Miss 
     Minneapolis steps ON STAGE - silver unitard, silver 
     streamers, silver tap shoes.  She starts a TAP ROUTINE 
     that RIVALS AMBER'S.

                    AMBER
               (whispering to camera)
          Oh my God.  Look at her, she's 
          awesome.  I should just go home now.

     Terry and Colleen stand in front of the stage.

                    TERRY
          Okay, okay, that's enough - I get it.  

     SUDDENLY Miss Minneapolis FREEZES.

                    MISS MINNEAPOLIS
          Oh - oh my God...
               (doubling over in pain)
          I gotta go!

     She runs off toward the RESTROOM.

                    COLLEEN
               (calling after her)
          Well, you're gonna have to do 
          somethin' with those nerves before 
          Nationals.  Thirty-million people 
          aren't gonna wait while you run to the 
          john.

     Other waiting contestants suddenly double over, ad-
     libbing "oh no! oh my God!"  "I'm gonna puke!" etc.  More 
     contestants grab their bellies.

          Today, a beauty pageant turned ugly.  
          A salmonella dysentery outbreak, now 
          traced to improperly refrigerated

     picnic table with Amber and Loretta.  Throughout the 
     following, Annette struggles to open a beer can which 
     keeps flying out of her pincers.  (Handmade 
     "congratulations" posters cover the lawn and trailer.)
