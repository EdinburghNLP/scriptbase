In a small Minnesota town, the annual beauty pageant is being covered by a TV crew.
Former winner Gladys Leeman wants to make sure her daughter follows in her footsteps.
Explosions, falling lights, and trailer fires prove that.
As the Leemans are the richest family in town the police are pretty relaxed about it all.
Despite everything, main rival (but nice) Amber Atkins won't be stopped.
There could well be more death and disappointment to come.
