                         THE AVENGERS



                    Screenplay by Don Macpherson



























                         June 21, 1995







1     BLUE SKY WITH CLOUDS

     PAN DOWN to reveal:


2     EXT - SALTFLATS - DAY

     A flat horizon, stretching to infinity.

     A 360 degree pan reveals: nothing.  Deserted, no hiding places.  No animals, no
     humans, no objects.  Except in mid distance --


3     RED PHONE BOX

     brightly painted, traditional, comforting, belongs in a village green.  Perfectly
     ordinary -- except for its location.

     Silence.  Only the wind over the plain.  Except --

     The PHONE RINGS.

     RING-RING ... a mellow, old-fashioned tone.  We wait for someone to answer it.  But
     of course nothing and nobody for miles.  Except --


4     IN DISTANCE

     a CAR ENGINE ... A puff of smoke on the horizon ... VA-VA-VOOM of high geared
     acceleration, as INTO VIEW

     ZOOM! --


5     CAR     

     speeding like a bullet.  Driven at maximum, breakneck speed, 125 mph.  A petite open
     top '65 Lotus Elan, all streamlined curves, full throttle, it nears the phone box, and --

     SCREECHES to a halt.

     Dust clears, ENGINE NOISE FADES.  From the seat, hops --


6     KINKY BOOT

     in black leather.

     Buckled.  Strap at ankle.  Crunching into the ground.
     PAN UP TO:


7     BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

     late 20's.  In CLOSEUPS of -- Tight black leather catsuit.  A flash of auburn hair. 
     Black leather like a second skin.  Smoothed over legs, thighs.  Buckled at wrists, straps
     at ankles, zips --

     Pulled up over flesh.  This is EMMA PEEL, scientist.  Sexual, invulnerable, cool.  Very
     cool.  She locks up at clouds in the sky.  Then steps across to the phone box.  Picks up
     the phone.

                         EMMA
               How now brown cow ...
                    (pause)
               The rain in Spain falls mainly
               on the plain ...
                    (pause)
               The quick brown fox jumped over
               the lazy --

     From the receiver, an irritated official voice.

                         VOICE (V.O.)
                    (filtered)
               Password affirmative. Thank you,
               Doctor.

     Emma puts down receiver.  Hangs a cardboard outside the phone box.  Then presses
     button bakelite box.

     A second's wait.  A coin from the slot.  Then a HUM as --


8     INSIDE PHONE BOX

     the floor lowers automatically.  Emma disappears.  Hanging outside the box, a notice
     now reads "Out of Order."

     Next to the call box we notice a sign: an arrow pointing into the desert:  "London 84
     miles."


9     INT.  LABORATORY

     underground.  Emma descends on the lift platform; steps into a research lab in retro hi
     tech.  Walks past assistants, down long pink and orange steel corridors, Werner von
     Braun goes disco.  Nears a door, marked:  "Prospero Project -- Authorized Personnel
     Only." Logo with lightning emerging from a cloud.


10      FROM AIRLOCK DOOR

     A man enters, older.  In matching leather suit: like an astronaut.  Early 40's, handsome,
     charismatic, with swept-back silver-black hair.  His name tag: DR. PETER PEEL.

                         PETER
               Ready, darling?

     Peter fixes her name tag: DR. EMMA PEEL; runs a finger down over her breast.  She
     smiles.

                         EMMA
               Ready as I'll ever be ...

     Mutual erotic, intellectual attraction.  Peter takes her hand and they walk down:


11      LONG CORRIDOR

     air-lock doors: a series of sealed chambers inside a hitech Labyrinth --

     A man joins them.  A shyer, bespectacled, less handsome version of Peter.  On his name
     tag: DR. VALENTINE PEEL -- brother and partner.

     In b.g., a countdown starts, ECHOING thru the lab

                         VALENTINE
               Atmospheric pressure checked, antenna ready... 
               Thermal chamber ready ... Compression module 
               set ... Temperature control on course between 
               one and one forty ... Water turbulence steady ...

                         PETER
               Anything else?

     Valentine smiles, shrugs --

                         VALENTINE
               Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.

                         EMMA
               Thanks, Valentine ...

     Emma gives him a quick peck on the cheek.

     A shy look from Valentine at Emma.  Peter senses

                         PETER
               Just a minute, darling. My brother's a 
               worry wart. I better have a word ...
               Valentine --

     Peter takes Valentine over to one side.  Emma checks gauges and dials.  Behind her a
     conversation.  Peter returns.

     He takes a ring from his finger --


12      CLOSEUP - DIAMOND GEM

     on a gold ring.


13      BACK TO SCENE

     He slips it onto her finger.

                         PETER
               Something to remember me by.

     Peter smiles.  The remark strikes Emma as curious.  But no time to query.  She smiles
     back.  He gives her a kiss --

                         PETER
                    (checks his watch)
               See you in an hour ...

                         EMMA
               One sunny day ...

     The countdown ECHOES around them as they separate.


14      IN DISTANCE

     Valentine watches her.


15      INT.  LAB CHAMBER

     Inside a bed of ice, Emma is lowered by hydraulic machine into a steel radioactive
     thermal chamber, glowing eerily blue

     The effect is very cold.  Frozen.  Numb.  Like a sci-fi Sleeping Beauty, beauty
     entombed and sealed in a glass coffin.  Plunged down into a vault.  Opposite her --

     In another glass coffin, Peter Peel, is lowered down.


16      FROM EMMA'S POV

     The sound of their HEARTBEATS.  Their BREATHING.  BLEEP and PULSE OF
     ELECTRONICS.  Thru glass and leather.  Like cerebral sex.  Technological, erotic.
     Peter winks at her -- Emma locks longingly at him, as --


17      UP IN CONTROL ROOM

     Valentine watches behind glass.  Like a kid excluded from a bedroom.  He attends to
     dials.  And to his female assistant --

                         VALENTINE
                    (thrilled)
               Readings still normal ...

     The assistant smiles oddly.  FOCUS ON --

     An insignia tattooed on her neck: "X404."  A replicant.
     They monitor screens.  A DULL HUM.


18      EXT.  SALTFLATS - DAY

     A weather antenna emerges from the ground:  an enigmatic phallic silver blob, like a
     Koons sculpture.  The sun glints off it ...


19      DOWN BELOW

     A temperature gauge rises.

     The ice is infused with pulsating colors: purple -- blue -- green -- red.  Starts to heat
up     as if --

     It soaks up temperature:  from cold to hot in instants.


20      CLOSEUP - WHITE GLOVED HAND ON DIAL

     "CUMULUS COLLECTOR." The graphs accelerate, but over the dull HUM -- a
     MURMUR, a BREATH.  As Emma's HEARTBEAT rises

     The gloved  hand turns up the dial, past a red danger mark.

     Suddenly a BLIP.  Something wrong.


21      DOWN IN HIS VAULT

     Peter Peel's "coffin" starts to overheat. Peter reacts --

                         PETER
                    (intercom cutting out)
               Losing control -- malfunction
               in thermal chamber -- for Christ's
               -- Emm --!


22      IN CONTROL ROOM

     Needles push off the dials, as --

     The ice swells: strange mix of colors, absorbing heat and energy in clusters of molten
     metal ... steam and sparks ignite ... Valentine's eyes widen in alarm ...

                         COUNTDOWN (V.O.)
               Five -- four --  three -- two --
               one ... Three -- two -- one ...
                    (repeating)
               Three -- two -- one ...


23      INSIDE COFFIN

     Peter's glass cracks

     The emergency light goes on -- the ALARM sounds -- lab assistants running ...


24      IN HER COFFIN

     Emma realizes; looks to Peter --


25      EXT.  SALTFLATS - DAY

     The "Koons" antenna is drawing a strange purple cloud towards it, from otherwise blue
     sky ... siphoning the purple atmosphere down itself into


26      INT.  CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Thru the air ducts the purple cloud starts to billow ... Panic stations! Valentine looks
     aghast at the graphs:  all systems fucked, over the intercom --

                         VALENTINE
               Emma, Peter, get out! It's going to explode!

     FROM Valentine's anguished face TO Emma's face, as

                         VALENTINE
               Emma ...


27      FROM HER VAULT

     Emma undoes the straps, clambers out of her pod


28      ANGLE (IN DREAMLIKE SLOW MOTION)

     Emma clambers onto her husband's pod -- in a sequence eternally replayed for her as a
     nightmare --


29      BACK TO SCENE

                         VALENTINE
               Get out! Leave him -- ! Emma!


30      RAPID INTERCUTS

     The purple smoke enveloping Peter's     pod, soft caresses -- Peter struggling within,
     looking at Emma --

                         EMMA
               Peter!

     Her leatherclad limbs straddled over his glass coffin.  Her HEARTBEAT sounds ... She
     grabs, claws on glass --

     Her fist draws back, blam! blam! blam! three deadly blows, Emma SMASHES the pod
     cover, it --

     Cracks -- splinters -- not breaking -- obscuring his face inside like a spider's web, as
     behind her

                         VALENTINE
               Don't wait for him -- he's not --

     Breathless, blood smeared on glass, Emma's gashed fist bleeds thru torn leather glove --
     twisted mass of flesh and glass -- GROWLING sound growing as:


31      ABOVE GROUND

     The voluminous purple cloud being sucked by the antenna...!


32      CLOSEUP ON EMMA'S DIAMOND RING

     gleaming thru a tear of blood as she pounds the glass --


33      BACK TO SCENE

                         PETER
                    (faint)
               Emma ... Emma ...

     As a GROWLING sound grows till

     BOOM!  An EXPLOSION rocks the vault -- flames burst out -- sound and vision
     separate -- Emma hears explosion as a slow moving tear thru her psyche.  A trauma.


34      ANGLE (IN EXTREME SLOW MOTION)     

     The blast flings Emma back thru space, flying unconscious as if in a dream, floating
     backwards in --

     A milky way op-art swirl of glass and steel fragments, now -- out of control,
     weightless, powerless, as --

     The background of sealed doors, white corridors all vanish. A spinning, black void
     opens up behind her, as her eyes shut, head falls back --

     An orgasmic, dream of near-death, as a CRASH OF MUSIC BEGINS a hip new
     version of the "AVENGERS" THEME TUNE --

     CREDITS SEQUENCE.


35      SERIES OF SHOTS

     In stark silhouette  The swishing of a bowler hat spinning thru space
     
     An umbrella tossed in the air, flicked like a deadly weapon --

     A rich velvety feel, key colors black/white/red.  Dandyish and erotic followed by blasts
     of violence, dreamy op-art puzzles and psychedelic patterns over --

     A sensuous BLACK, background -- slowly revealed to be a woman's leather-clad 
     body --

     In silhouette -- A bowler hatted man, Steed, a catsuited woman Emma.  Flashes of: 
     hair -- eye -- a red rose -- in bloom -- petals folding and unfolding, then tightly shut.

     A thorned stem, sharp to the touch --

     FROM black and white INTO color -- leather Background metamorphosing into black
     and white of a chessboard as ...

     A medieval knight moves around its queen in a formal dance --

     A fetishistic attention to detail: leather catsuit, swish of legs, boots ... hair tossed
     back - - red nails over black ... creamy white skin ... zips ...

     A silhouetted man in bowler hat in Savile Row suit -- old Etonian knotted tie --
     umbrella stabs like a sword --

     Umbrella with knotted stems of a rose furling round -- then a tear, gash -- rose cut and
     tossed into --

     His lapel. Until, at the end: together in silhouette.
     Bowler hat thrown, skimming, swishing thru air, until --

     Now only a single HEARTBEAT ... BA-BOOM ... BA-BOOM ...
     Then --

     PISTOL SHOTS OVER as:


36      INT.  EMMA'S BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN

     A gasp as Emma wakes abruptly from her nightmare, years later, startled by the shots,
     naked beneath satin sheets.  Her HEARTBEAT FADES as she looks around her Klaus
     Oldenberg room, vinyl comforter, satin sheets.  A toss of her hair.

     Looks more mature. Sexual, haunted. Mrs. Emma Peel -- widow.

     Same every night.  Next to the clock, a framed photo of her dead husband, Peter Peel.
     From outside ANOTHER SHOT ...

     Emma flings on a satin robe, goes to the window and sees --


37      HER POV

     a CAR zooooming past, its bowler-hatted driver racing thru early morning streets.  The
     damn thing BACKFIRES again ...


38      BACK TO SCENE

     Emma frowns, annoyed.


39      EXT.  STREETS - DAWN

     Zoom!  The sleek, sporty black Jaguar SS100 burns down deserted streets.  Inside is a
     bowler-hatted man --

     JOHN STEED, late 30's.  Handsome English gent, roguish looks, dandy's clothes.  A
     Beau Brummel figure in a Savile Row suit, velvet collar, embroidered waistcoat.
     A debonair Etonian, Steed oozes charm, wit and - when he chooses to -- hard-edged,
     steely menace.  He drives through --

40      LONDON (1999)

     This is 'Avengersland': a parallel world painted by Rene Magritte, forever England.
     Bright pinks, greens and reds, an imperial city in final decadent bloom.  White stucco
     buildings. Regency style in candy colors.  A surreally 90's city like a hipper, edgier
     version of the 60's preserved in aspic, where --

     Over the RADIO, a plummy voice:

                         ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    (filtered)
               ... The War Office today approved military 
               expenditure for the nation's new defense alert 
               system. A spokesman  said he would raise the 
               matter at the forthcoming World  Council of 
               Ministers, but that a state of vigilance was 
               still necessary in the uncertain climate.

     As Steed turns into a mews, we realize that in this kinky, pop world, ordinary life does
     not intrude.  No traffic.  No extras.  Nothing to spoil the view.

     As the radio continues with a weather forecast, Steed --


41      EXT.  STEED'S GARAGE - DAWN     

     Steed's car enters his garage -- Door closes as --


42      INT.  STEED'S FLAT - DAWN

     but the curtains are still drawn so the place is dark.

     A large bachelor's den.  Dark wood, leather armchairs ...

     Steed enters his library from a concealed door --
     Titles on wine and birdwatching.  He clicks the door, goes to his drinks cabinet. Pours
     a brandy.  Hears a noise ...

     Instantly on guard.  In his glass, sees a shadowy reflection move.  Steed peers 'round a
     corner.  Sees a silhouetted figure stand over his desk -- a burglar?
     Steed sneaks up behind -- raises his umbrella, and --

     Crack!  Brings the umbrella down -- on the suspect's head.  Who manages to dodge,
     swivel 'round, and --

     Bam!  Delivers an expert blow to Steed's stomach.  A rapid exchange of blows.  Steed
     recoils, about to jab the umbrella, when --

     His assailant about to deliver a kick to his crotch -- Steed covers the area -- bam! a
     spiked heel hits his bowler -- as the curtains are drawn back, light floods in -- they
     freeze.

     Steed knows his opponent:  a lethal blonde in red leather.

                         STEED
               Brenda -- ?


43      FROM ABOVE HIM

     a voice --

                         MOTHER (O.S.)
               Steed -- ?!


44      BACK TO SCENE

     Steed swivels 'round to face -- upside down -- a man hanging like a bat from the ceiling
     inches before him --

     Pommaded hair, fat, dandyish:  MOTHER, head of secret services; hands of extendable
     metal hooks.  And BRENDA, his beautiful leather-clad bodyguard.  Who smiles
     seductively.

                         STEED
               Mother. I thought you were burglars.

                         MOTHER
               Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.

     Mother suits action to the word, drops into his wheelchair.

                         BRENDA
               See how you're getting on ...

                         STEED
               Something in the wind?

     Mother wheels himself from the study.  Taps a barometer.  It whirls around.

                         MOTHER
               Weather's turning nasty.

                         STEED
               You didn't come to talk about the
               weather, surely.

                         MOTHER
               Oh yes I did. I want you to meet
               somebody.
                    (off Steed's look)
               I expect you'll like her.

     Brenda coolly files her nails.  A flash of jealousy.

                         STEED
               'Her'?


45      INT.  EMMA'S FLAT (PRIMROSE HILL) - DAY

     A groovy penthouse (a Lichtenstein come to life?).  Bach PIANO MUSIC floats in the
     air.

     Hands gliding over keys, Emma Peel plays with virtuoso skill.  On the piano, a framed
     picture of her late husband.  And a photo of Emma between Peter and Valentine.

     A KNOCK.  Emma gets up, goes to the door.  The MUSIC KEEPS PLAYING, keys
     jumping up and down automatically, as --


46      AT DOOR

     Emma flicks open a large automated eye.  Peers thru.  Opens


47      IN CORRIDOR

     A MESSENGER (distinctive outfit) hands over a package tied in a bow.

                         MESSENGER
               Dr. Peel?

                         EMMA
               Thank you ...

     Emma shuts the door.  Unties the bow, opens up  Finds an embossed card:

                         EMMA
                    (reads)
               'Please answer the Telephone.'

     Emma looks: The phone sits there.

     Just then ... RING-RING.  Emma goes over, picks up the phone.  A recorded message,
     an upper-class woman's voice:

                         WOMAN (V.O.)
                    (filtered)
               Boodles Club, the Mall, 2:30 p.m.
               Mr. John Steed ... Boodles Club,
               the Mall, 2:30 p.m. Mr. John
               Steed ...

     BEEP.  The phone goes dead.  Emma opens up the case.  Unveils a brace of kippers.
     Puzzled, she holds up a fish.

                         EMMA
               Kippers ...?


48      EXT.  BOODLE-S CLUB (PALL MALL) - DAY

     Near the Mall, outside white stucco buildings, a Lotus Elan pulls up and parks as a car
     conveniently leaves, cutting off another angry CAR.  HONK!  A dash clock says 2:15.
     Out gets --

     -- Emma Peel, different attire.  She climbs steps.  On a brass plaque, "Boodles
     Gentlemen's Club."  She goes in, passing --

     -- an astonished uniformed commissionaire.


49      INT.  BOODLES' LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     A PORTER approaches her, equally surprised.

                         PORTER
               May I help you, madam ...

                         EMMA
               Mr. John Steed, please.

                         PORTER
               I'm afraid that's impossible.

                         EMMA
               Impossible?

     The Porter points to a notice:  "No non-members.  No animals.  No women."

                         PORTER
               You are female?

                         EMMA
               As you see.

                         PORTER
               Then you can't come in.

                         EMMA
               I have an appointment.

                         PORTER
               No women. Not in Boodles. Not
               since 1922.

                         EMMA
               Really -- what happened in 1922?

     Bored, Emma breezes past, already inside the hall.  Old mahogany, portraits of dead
     politicians, leather chairs.  A male enclave.

     The Porter rushes up to restrain her.

     Hardly missing a step, Emma lays a gentle hand on his shoulder -- finds the nerve ends. 
     The Porter winces and --

                         EMMA
               Thank you so much. I can find Mr.
               Steed myself ...

     -- collapses on the ground in agony.  Emma ignores him.  Pushes thru double doors,
     upstairs, statues of naked bronze warriors frown down on her, into


50      INT.  BOODLES - TURKISH BATHS - DAY

     Thru a cloud of steam in an oriental room

     Steed sits naked save for a towel.  He hears a disturbance, thru the mist, sees --

     Emma before him.  Automatically, Steed dons his bowler and tips it in her direction.

                         STEED
               Doctor Peel, I presume?

                         EMMA
               And you must be Steed. Please
               don't get up.

     He doesn't.  HISSING STEAM between them as they study.

                         STEED
               I was about to throw in the towel.

                         EMMA
               I had a spot of bother at the door.

                         STEED
               I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman
               inside Boodles since --

                         EMMA
               1922. Why the kippers?

                         STEED
               Red herring would have been too
               obvious, don't you think?

                         EMMA
                    (looks around)
               So what was all this -- some sort
               of test?

                         STEED
               Congratulations, you've penetrated a 
               bastion of male privilege. I guessed 
               you weren't a stickler for Tradition, 
               doctor.

                         EMMA
               Whereas you are.

                         STEED
               Dyed in the wool. But I can admire 
               someone who doesn't play by the 
               rules.

                         EMMA
               Rules are made to be broken.

                         STEED
               Not by me. Play by the rules,
               Doctor, or the game is nothing.

                         EMMA
               And just what is the game?

                         STEED
               I say, this is all terribly formal.  
               Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?

                         EMMA
                    (re:  the steamroom) 
               Under the circumstances, you may 
               call me Mrs. Peel.

                         STEED
               Much better.

                         EMMA
               And now that we've settled the matter 
               of honorifics, will you kindly explain 
               why you wished me to meet you?

                         STEED
               I didn't. Mother did.

                         EMMA
               Mother?

     Steed steps closer, smiling.

                         STEED
               I expect you'll like him.

     Off Emma's reaction --


51      EXT.  THAMES RIVER (NEAR WHITEHALL) - DAY

     CAR ROAR OVER.  Down the embankment Parliament and Big Ben in b.g., the sleek
     Jaguar zooms at 60mph.  Steed dodges traffic --

     Wearing racing goggles, windscreen down --

     Executes a nifty maneuver, swerves on a zebra crossing, scatters pedestrians,
     HONKING his HORN.  Beside him, Emma is cool as a cucumber.  Steed turns
     charmingly.

                         STEED
               Tea time -- four o'clock.  Mustn't
               be late.
                    (beat)
               A word of warning. Don't take the
               macaroon. Mother's favorite.

     Steed swerves down a narrow alleyway, into a secret car park entrance by the
     riverbank.  He pulls up before a sign:

               RIVER THAMES WATER AUTHORITY
                         No Admittance

     At a control barrier Steed inserts a card.  Emma sees a light flash up: "Security -- Top
     Priority Clearance Only."  The barrier lifts.  She looks again at Steed, reappraising him
     as Big Ben approaches four.  The car disappears in darkness ...

52      LARGE WINDOW CURTAIN

     opens, revealing water!  We are beneath the Thames -- garbage and fish float past a
     window of reinforced glass.  An original Campbell's tomato soup can floats down as we
     WIDEN to reveal ...

     Mother in his wheelchair, pulling the curtain cord.

                         MOTHER
               That's better. I much prefer a
               womb with view, don't you, Mrs.
               Peel?

     A delicate CLOCK on the mantel CHIMES FOUR.

     Mother wheels himself forward and hooks onto the kettle.

                         MOTHER
               Shall I be mother?

     He pours, presiding like a fat spider at the center of a subterranean web, known as The
     Ministry: a vast bureaucracy in a labyrinth of tunnels.

     Catches Emma's wandering lock

                         MOTHER
               I expect you're wondering where
               you are.

     An atmosphere of a gentleman's club reigns in the subterranean bureau -- Emma takes
     her tea ...

                         EMMA
               Don't tell me: You're the shadow secret 
               service. You're so hushhush, even the 
               legit secret service knows nothing about 
               it. Am I right?

     Bodyguard Brenda, a glam leather Moneypenny, wheels a trolley brimming with fancies
     over to Emma and Steed.

                         MOTHER
               Close. We're so hush-hush, even
               we know nothing about it.
                    (before Emma can
                    make sense of this) 
               Now let's see, there's coconut cake, 
               date and walnut; I recommend the 
               rum baba ...

                         EMMA
               Hmmm ...

                         MOTHER
               Looks like rain, Steed...

                         STEED
               ... Showers followed by sunny periods.

                         EMMA
                    (looks up from
                    trolley)
               We're not here to talk about the
               weather, surely.

                         MOTHER
               Oh, yes we are.

                         BRENDA
                    (to Emma, cunning)
               Macaroon?

     Emma hesitates; takes a cake.  About to take a bite, when --

     Mother switches off lights.  A screen drops, covering the water window as the mood
     changes from coziness to terror -- an ancient PROJECTOR RATTLES on ...

54      IN DARKNESS

     Emma watches on the wall, an official Ministry film of macabre death tableaux in the
     English countryside:

                         MOTHER
               We've had a series of bizarre weather reports.  
               We kept them hush-hush and sent agents into 
               the field for data. Case number one: 
               April 14, 3:35 P.M., Special Agent Simkins 
               investigating mysterious fires in corn circles.  
               A field outside the village of Little Snoring, 
               one of the hottest days of the year. Trapped 
               by a sudden blizzard. Found frozen to death 
               in a giant ice cube -- like a mammoth in 
               perma-frost.
                    (the picture changes)
               Case two: Pilot Raymond Shaw, May 6, 11:28 A.M. 
               Took off from a deserted airstrip near Stoke Poges, 
               investigating bizarre atmospheric reports. A freak 
               rainstorm downed him. Knocked unconscious by a 
               flying fish, falling from 15,000 feet. Twenty-five 
               inches of rain in eight minutes, over an area the size 
               of a cricket pitch ...
                    (the picture changes)
               ... Case three: June 2, 5:43 P.M. Defense Chief 
               Major Courtnay. Remains discovered in a turnip 
               field near Ashby de la Zouche. Our boffins 
               recorded a sudden blast of heat. Scorched earth, 
               temperature of 1000 degrees. Spontaneous 
               combustion. Not much of him left ...

     CLICK.  The lights go back on.  Emma notices - a new arrival
     
     a tall, striking OLDER WOMAN; dark glasses.

                         MOTHER
               My number two. Special assignments.  
               She's --

                         EMMA
               Let me guess -- 'Father'?

                         FATHER (OLDER WOMAN)
               All happy families here, Mrs. Peel.

     Father's dark glasses turn to Emma like a hawk.  Runs her fingers over Emma's face. 
     Gets the outline.  Emma realizes --

                         EMMA
               You're --

     Blind ... Father smiles.

                         FATHER
               God, you're quick.

                         MOTHER
               Have a look at these, Mrs. Peel --

     He passes 'round a box of evidence related to the screen events:  Steed investigates a
     pair of black shoes and bowler; Emma, a fish.  The shoes have agent Simkins' name
     in them ...

                         STEED
               Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My
               shoemaker.

                         EMMA
                    (unimpressed)
               A kipper. Or a red herring? What were 
               they investigating?

                         FATHER
               A series of bizarre shifts in local weather 
               patterns ...

                         STEED
               Global warming?

                         FATHER
               Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush 
               English village transformed overnight 
               into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?

                         EMMA
               How curious ...

                         MOTHER
               Something strange is happening. And 
               whoever knows about it doesn't want 
               us to find out.

                         FATHER
                    (to Steed)
               Your mission is simple. Find out
               how and why these agents died.

                         EMMA
               I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?

                         MOTHER
               Your research into climate engineering was 
               state-of-the-art. Your experiments could 
               have revolutionized our knowledge of global 
               warming -- had they succeeded. We need 
               your expertise.

                         STEED
               Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor 
               again, Mrs. Peel --

     Emma hesitates, unsure for the first time ...

                         EMMA
               I'm not sure I'm ready to return to work.  
               I've been out of action for some time. I'll 
               consider your proposal.

     She gets up, ready to go.

                         FATHER
               One moment, Mrs. Peel. There's another 
               special reason we wanted you to join our 
               happy family; rather curious, actually ...

     Mother hits the lights.  He flicks the video into slow-mo.  File thru image clarification,
     identikit sketches.

                         MOTHER
               Eye witness reports. Strangers in the area.  
               One description tallied in all three places.  
               Recognize her?

     Emma locks.  On the screen comes -- Emma Peel.  Steed reacts.

                         EMMA
               Me, isn't it?

     Emma stares at the screen: incredible.  Like a twin sister.

                         FATHER
               Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel.  
               With a twist. You're our chief suspect.

                         EMMA
               You're saying I have no choice.

                         MOTHER
               Father will be your controller. Steed here 
               will show you the ropes.

                         EMMA
                    (very arch)
               Ropes?

                         MOTHER
               She may not know. Theory goes she
               may be very ill.

                         STEED

               Darling.

58      INT.  SECRET SERVICE HQ PSY OPS ROOM

     A gallery of portraits of Emma Peel projected on the wall based on Warhol's Jackie
     (1964) -- Poignant, inscrutable, fascinating, iconic -- blown up, dissected, analyzed. 
     The swirling newspaper dots cover Mother and Steed like bubbles from a light show.

     As DR. DARLING, head of the Ministry's Psychological Operations (Psy Ops) -- a
     kind of spy version of Timothy Leary, briefs them. In his thick dark glasses and beard,
     Darling's obsessive interest in Emma adds a sinister air.

                         DR. DARLING
               One key point: Mrs. Peel is a widow:
               she's obsessively devoted to the memory 
               of her husband the scientist Peter Peel. 
               You may find her a little ... remote.

     Images of Peter Peel on the wall.  Of Emma with him.

                         DR. DARLING
               They were a team. Met at Cambridge. 
               Working on a top secret research mission 
               into weather conditions, code name The
               Prospero Project, when Peel died.

     Steed looks meaningfully at Mother.

                         MOTHER
               Something went wrong. System malfunction.  
               Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape.  
               Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File 
               still open.

                         STEED
               How come you took so much interest
               in her, Dr. Darling?

                         DR. DARLING
               Her husband was one of ours.

                         STEED
                    (eyes Peel's photo,
                    then Mother)
               Peel? Did she know?

                         MOTHER
               Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She 
               was in a dangerous game, Steed. High 
               stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If 
               she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.

                         STEED
               Anyone particular in mind?

                         MOTHER
               You.

     OFF Steed's reaction.  CLASHING BLADES OVER ...


59      INT.  SECRET SERVICE FENCING SALON

     Steed and Emma (new outfit), cross swords.  Like everything else she does, Emma is a
     champion.  Steed is hard put.  Both fence attached to cables -- very high-tech 
     dueling ...

     Steed is in white; Emma (natch), in black ... yin and yang ...

                         STEED
               You're a lady of hidden talents,
               Mrs. Peel ...

     Tic-tac ...

                         EMMA
               I've no intention of hiding them ...

     Tic-tac ...

                         STEED
               Scientist ...
                    (tic-tac)
               ... marksman ...
                    (tic-tac)
               ... swordsman ...
                    (tic-tac)
               ... To what do you attribute your 
               overachievements?

     Fast swordplay.  Tic-tac-tic-tac-tic.  Steed's good, too.

                         EMMA
               My father always wanted a boy.

                         STEED
               Really?  I fail to see the connection.

                         EMMA
               I had a feeling you would. Touche!

     She lunges; her foil tips right into the heart on Steed's chest.  BUZZ!  Steed removes
     his mask; holds her foil tip.

                         STEED
               I take your point.

     Emma takes off her mask.

                         EMMA
               Do you?

                         STEED
               Yes indeed. I need protection.


60      EXT.  SIGN - DAY

     "Trubshaw's of Jermyn Street, since 1756."  Steed's Jag parked in front -- of course
     there's a space.  Getting out

                         EMMA
               I thought we were on our way.

                         STEED
               Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man 
               worth meeting. No point setting out 
               half shod.

                         EMMA
                    (dry)
               Or half cocked.

61      CLOSEUP - TRUBSHAW

     slips Steed's hand-made shoes an.  The "lasts" shapes of shoes beside him -- bear
     Steed's name.

                         STEED
               I couldn't agree more. Thank you, 
               Trubshaw.

                         TRUBSHAW
                    (significantly)
               Very good, Mr. Steed.

62      INT.  TRUBSHAW'S GENTLEMEN'S SHOP - DAY

     A bull moose's antlers.  A horned rhino.  A Leopard.  A tiger.  Then next to them, in a
     wall of hunting trophies Emma paces impatiently beneath them.  Shop assistants attend
     in tails and wing-collars, very old school tie.  Steed emerges helped into a new flashy
     waistcoat ...

                         EMMA
                    (gags at the waistcoat)
               Steed, we really must be --

                         STEED 
                    (relishing his shoes)
               Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a 
               hand-made shoe. As unique as a face 
               or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?


63      BEHIND DISPLAY

     Eyes watching Emma and Steed rise ...

                         EMMA
               You can but I wish you wouldn't ...

                         STEED
               Thank you, Trubshaw ...

     A youngish man -- in black polo neck, Beatle-cut mop, pauting lips, smart suit, druggy
     high-pitched giggle.  BAILEY, a cocky, cool psychopath.  He watches Steed and
     Emma leave ...

     ... and saunters after them ...  CAR ROAR OVER.


64      EXT.  LONDON STREETS - DAY

     as the Jag races through them, heading for the country.

                         EMMA (V.O.)
               That place is so absurd, so out of date ...

                         STEED (V.O.)
               Do you really think so?

     Another car follows them ... as they pass Buckingham Palace, now painted pink and
     guarded by female grenadiers ...

65      SIGN

     reading:  "Scotland" with an arrow, as Steed and Emma zoom past in the Jag ...

                         STEED (V.O.)
               Press that button, would you?
               Tea?

66      CLOSEUP - SPECIAL DASHBOARD COMPARTMENT

     opens, revealing a tea service: a samovar of tea, feeding into a pre-warmed pot,
     pouring into two china cups ...

     WIDEN to reveal:

67      INT.  JAG - DAY

     Emma, reacts, pours from the samovar ...

                         STEED
               Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt
               your flow of oratory ...


     Steed's JAG BACKFIRES again as at the beginning ...

                         EMMA
               You know what I mean. This car
               -- and you. Nobody walks around
               like that. Milk?

                         STEED
               Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs.
               Peel. No thank you.

     She hands over a cup.

                         EMMA
               But why? What's the point?

                         STEED
               A Gentleman has to have a code.
               This is part of mine. A uniform.
               Think of it as my suit of shining
               armor.

                         EMMA
               And I suppose you're the knight.

                         STEED
               The most unpredictable piece on
               the board. And always ready to
               protect his queen.

                         EMMA
               That's predictable. When I find
               a queen in need of protection
               I'll let you know.

     Steed looks in the mirror.  Behind them, a car.  Tailing?

                         STEED
               I'm hoping you will.

     He puts his foot down.  Zoom ...


68      EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

     Towards picturesque Scotland.  The JAG ROARS by - then the other car ...


69      INT.  JAG - DAY

     Emma consults a list, reads --

                         EMMA
               Sir August Merryweather ... why
               are we seeing him first?

                         STEED
               As per mother's instructions.

                         EMMA
               Do we always follow Mother's
               instructions?

                         STEED
               For a man in my position --

                         EMMA
               Just what is your position, if you don't 
               mind my asking.  How did a stuffed 
               shirt like you get into this line of work?

                         STEED
                    (smiles)
               They call me in when they've reached a 
               dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.

                         EMMA
               I have no choice. Why should you
               risk your life?

                         STEED
               After our fencing match, I was rather 
               hoping you would do the risking.  
               More tea?

                         EMMA
               No thanks.

                         STEED
               I meant me.

     Emma takes in Steed's evasive answers.  Sighing, she pours.


70      EXT.  HIGHLANDS - DAY

     The Jag winds around Loch Ness, followed by the car.

                         STEED (V.O.)
               According to Mother, Sir August owns 
               half of the Highlands. A millionaire.  
               Former head of Special Projects at the 
               Ministry. Now ...

                         EMMA (V.O.)
               An eccentric recluse?


71      INT.  JAG - DAY

                         STEED
               Not so much eccentric. More barking 
               mad. He has a wife called June. And 
               a daughter somewhere -- Julie.

                         EMMA
               June, July ... August?

                         STEED
               The family does seem to be somewhat 
               meteorologically inclined.

                         EMMA
               Any other vices?

                         STEED
               All of a piece, really. A fanatical 
               weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY.
                    (off her look)
               British Royal Organisation For
               Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British 
               weather has been tampered with 
               by ... aliens.

     Emma takes this in.

                         EMMA
               So ... I distract him while you snoop 
               around? How?

                         STEED
               Small talk.  Try the weather.


72      EXT.  HUGE COUNTRY HOUSE - DAY

     Steed and Emma speed up to the huge open main gates

     Signs:  "Private: No Admittance."  Guards in hunting gear and plus fours, with loaded
     rifles.  They start up the drive ...

     Several peacocks on the lawn fan open their beautiful tails.

     One of them, a mechanical peacock whose thousand eyes CLICK with the WHIR of a
     CAMERA ...

     The other car pulls in behind. Inside, reveal Bailey watching them.


73      INT.  MANOR HOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

     On a tartan carpet, a SCOTTIE BARKS furiously at a set of EXPIRING BAGPIPES
     on the floor.  PAN UP to reveal:

     A BUTLER leading Emma down the corridor --

     -- where she admires the eccentric fixtures, pausing to note a large teddy bear outfit
     with tartan trimmings instead of the usual suit of armor.

                         EMMA
               Original ...

                         BUTLER
               This way, miss ...

                         EMMA
               Missus ...

     He opens the double doors, admitting Emma into


74      INT.  A LARGE ROOM

     of semi-tropical climate.  Jungle plants, parakeets, snakes.  Walls lined with display
     cabinets and bell jars:  stuffed birds, butterflies, spiders.  A thermometer reads:

     100 degrees with high humidity. The Butler leaves.

     Emma fans herself.  Nobody in the roam.  But hears a sound of RAINFALL from a
     smoked glass conservatory.

                         EMMA
               Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?

                         VOICE (O.S.)
               Eh? In here!

     Emma follows the SOUND, steps cautiously forward.

75      INT.  CONSERVATORY

     beneath a sprinkler system of torrential rain, an old man splashes in bizarre rubber togs.
     Emma stays cool.

                         EMMA
               I've come to apply for membership
               in Brolly --

                         SIR AUGUST
                    (shouts above the tempest)
               You don't get rain like you used to in 
               England. A good shower that's the ticket.  
               Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells 
               the namby-pamby in a man.

     SIR AUGUST steps out of the shower and wind machine.  A belted rubber macintosh,
     flippers, goggles.  He starts to disrobe, the NOISE DIES DOWN --

                         EMMA
               I so agree. How did you acquire a 
               taste for it?

                         SIR AUGUST
               Out in India. So character-forming for the 
               British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The 
               rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen 
               inches overnight. A whole week of lovely 
               rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...

     Sir August removes his goggles, recognizes her.

                         SIR AUGUST
               You

                         EMMA
               Have we met?

                         SIR AUGUST
               You mean you don't recall??

     Before Emma can reply, the door opens...

                         SIR AUGUST
               Ah, Lady June ...

     Emma's attention switches to LADY JUNE, a buxom lady in a sou'wester and galoshes,
     who wheels in a tray of scones.

                         LADY JUNE
               Dear August.  Loves his showers.
               Like a baby.
                    (beat)
               Scones, Mrs. Peel?

                         EMMA
               Thank you, Lady -- June ...

     Emma sees Sir August gazing wistfully out of the window, which is rapidly 
     darkening ...

                         SIR AUGUST
               Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.

                         EMMA
               Promised? Who promised?

                         SIR AUGUST
               There, look!

     Emma looks, sees rain start to pitter-patter on the windows.  Emma exchanges looks
     with June as the rain starts pouring.

                         SIR AUGUST
               Imagine being caught out in a blow 
               like that!

76      EXT.  MOORLAND - DAY

     THUNDER and lightning -- Steed is caught out in it; puts up his umbrella; wanders
     over the brow of a hill, past a big sign:  "No Trespassers."  Rains more.  And more.
     Turns to a tempest, as --

                         STEED
               I say, this is a bit much.

     Lashed by rain ' Steed carries on to the brow of the hill.  He looks over, peers through
     the mist at --

     A deep purple cloud.  Mushrooming towards him.

     Steed can't escape it.  It envelops him.  Starts to blink.  Cough.  Footsteps less sure. 
     Surrounded by thick purple haze

     Steed stumbles and falls

     Down a hill.  Tumbles to the bottom.  He knocks his head on a rock.  Steed blinks,
     shakes his head.  Eyes refocus.  He sees


77      UNDULATING SAND DUNES

     Sun shining down on yellow sand, a barren vista.  Dead trees.  Suddenly Steed's in the
     Sahara.  A heat haze shimmers.

     Steed blinks, thinks he's dreaming when he sees ...


78      IN DISTANCE - RED PHONE BOX

     Steed heads towards it.  The PHONE BOX seems further away.  Like an optical
     illusion.  Then hears RINGING.

     Steed still bowler-hatted.  Overcoat.  Perspiring.  Takes off bowler, wipes brow. 
     Adjusts rose in buttonhole.  It wilts.

     He arrives at the phone box. Opens the door.  Steed picks up the RINGING PHONE,
     listens to --

     A SCRATCHY ORCHESTRAL RECORDING of "The Merry Widow."

                         STEED
               'The Merry Widow'...?

     Over the MUSIC, a strange --

                         VOICE (V.O.)
                    (filtered)
               ... Hello ... Hello? ... Who the
               hell...? Who is this? ... You must
               leave the test area. I repeat,
               leave the area ... Help is on the
               way ...

     CLICK.  The line goes dead.  Steed is baffled.  Steps out, sees --


79      ON HORIZON

     a shimmering heat haze.  A figure on a camel moving towards them.  Steed watches
     amazed, as the camel pads closer ...

     The mirage arrives. The rider dismounts. A woman in yashmak and veils. She draws
     closer. Drops the veils to reveal --

     Emma Peel.  In her black leather catsuit.

               Mrs. Peel. Good of you to drop by. 
               And I see you're wearing your - 
               riding outfit?

     Emma moves closer.  Steed smiles at her.  Emma closer and -- chop! -- gives a kung-fu
     jab to the throat, a kick to the balls, a jab to the stomach.  As Steed lies on the 
     ground --

                         STEED
               Manners, Mrs. Peel.

     Emma takes out a .38 GUN, points at his heart, FIRES -- 

     BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  FOUR SHOTS --


80      EMMA'S POV

     -- The bullets strike his chest.  Round his heart.  Steed slumps back on the sands.  Eyes
     close ...


81      EMMA

     moves over him. Drops a small toy snowshaker into his curled fingers. Blows a good
     bye kiss.


82      STEED'S POV     82

     The sun.  Clouds roll by.  The camel peers down at him.

                                             
          FADE TO BLACK.

     Sound of CLACKING ...

     FADE IN:

83      INT.  SECRET SERVICE HOSPITAL - DAY

     A hospital ward.  Empty apart from one bed.  A nurse (Brenda in her red leather), her
     spiked heels clacking on the floor, brings over a cup of tea to

     Steed in a hospital bed.  Who wakes, surprised to see Emma.  Peering over him.  Very
     nonchalant.  Eating his grapes.

                         STEED
               Ah, Brenda ...
                    (as she leaves)
               Mrs. Peel?

                         EMMA
               You should be dead.  How do you
               feel?

                         STEED
                    (eyes her)
               Strange.

                         EMMA
               You were very lucky.  Four shots to 
               the heart. I found you after I slipped 
               away from Sir August. Mother brought 
               you here. Not me you should thank.

                         STEED
               I wasn't about to.

                         EMMA
               I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your
               bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought 
               you were just overdressed.

                         STEED
               I might say the same.

84      FROM GALLERY

     Mother with Dr. Darling taking notes.  Emma looks up at them.  Drops to a whisper. 
     But they both are wearing headphones.

                         EMMA
               Mother and Dr. Darling have me 
               under observation. They think I 
               tried to kill you.

                         STEED
               Why should they think that?

                         EMMA
               You told them. You said I arrived 
               on a camel, shot you four times. 
               Left you for dead.

                         STEED
               Frankly that's how I remember it.

                         EMMA
               But that's absurd. I may not be 
               over-fond of you, Steed, but it's 
               not my style.

                         STEED
               Perhaps your memory plays tricks,
               Mrs. Peel.

                         EMMA
                    (conceding)
               That's possible. Sir August was convinced 
               he'd met me before. But I'd never met him.  
               Another odd thing. When it rained, he said 
               it was just as someone had promised.

                         STEED
               Did he say who?

                         EMMA
               No. But he must know. Incidentally, 
               my double left you with this.

     Emma shows Steed the toy snow scene.  A winter wonderland snow scene.  He looks
     puzzlingly at it.  On its underneath. "The Wonderland Corporation," followed by --

                         STEED
               An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?

                         EMMA
               Did you say formal? I must dress.


85      EXT.  LONDON STREET - NIGHT

     The sporty Jag pulls up outside a tall, swanky building.  Steed gets out, opens her door.
     Irritated, Emma steps out of the car, clad in her leather suit --


86      CLOSEUP OF HER HEEL

     hitting the street.   PAN UP TO Steed, admiring --

                         STEED
               I must say, you look more your
               old self --

                         EMMA
               You mean my other self ...

                         STEED
               Either way ... may I ask: why
               you dress in that fashion?

                         EMMA
               I should have thought that was
               obvious ...
                    (off his smirk)
               I'm in mourning.

     She moves off.  Stay on his poker face.

                         STEED
               I can't wait to see afternoon.

     He joins her; they survey the building.

                         EMMA
               Where's the picnic?

     They look up to --


87      INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

     A boardroom suite, overlooking London.  Lights twinkling --

     Around a conference table.  Twelve TEDDY BEARS.  Each six feet tall.  Ridiculous
     and sinister.  In pink, turquoise, brown, black, white, green.  Furry, giant paws and
     ears, swivel eyes.  One teddy sports a familiar tartan ...

     On the table, children's party food: jellies, hundreds and thousands, birthday cakes. 
     And wrapped presents before each.

     Each bear has a name-badge: Bobby, Bobo, Bruno, Bibi, Betty, Binky etc. pinned to
     their fur.  A children's tune, "THE TEDDY BEAR'S PICNIC," plays.  Followed by -
     a gavel rapping order.

     A distinctively chilling voice, eerily familiar and seductive, which ECHOES through our
     story --

                         VOICE (V.O.)
                    (filtered)
               Ladies, gentlemen and bears ...

     The teddy bears look round.  Can't hear who's talking.

                         VOICE (V.O.)
                    (filtered)
               Today is history. The first day of the future. 
               I welcome you to the first general meeting 
               of the Wonderland Corporation, now allied 
               with our colleagues from Brolly ...

     Murmurs of congratulations amongst the bears ...

                    (filtered)
               You have all given time, money and expertise 
               to achieve our goal. But we are reaching a 
               new phase of our operation. From today, 
               many of you will no longer be needed. I have 
               to warn you ...

     Dismay from the teddy bears.  As a CUCKOO CLOCK RINGS OUT,

                         VOICE (V.O.)
                    (filtered)
               A cuckoo.  The first sign of spring, and ... 
               A cuckoo in our nest. Our organization is 
               no longer secret. Agents are investigating 
               us. Their names are John Steed and Emma 
               Peel. I believe we have a traitor among us 
               ... perhaps more than one ...

     Uproar from the teddy bears.  Shouts of "Who?" (*PS: One of the Teddys is a giant
     rabbit who seems especially alarmed).

                         VOICE (V.O.)
                    (filtered)
               That remains to be seen. When we find 
               the traitors, they will be dealt with severely.

                         TEDDY BEAR #l
               These agents.  Where are they?

                    (filtered)
               Here. In this building. By our estimate, they 
               will enter this room in thirty-five point five 
               seconds precisely ...

     Panic.  The bears scramble to go, bumping into each other.

                         VOICE (V.O.)
                    (filtered)
               I am sorry the party is over.  But we 
               shall meet again.
               To each of you a gift. A token of
               my appreciation.

     In front of the teddy bears, each one receives a present wrapped up in paper with a pink
     and silver bow.

     The tartan teddy opens his up:  A snow scene.  Anxious moans.


88      INT.  BUILDING - NIGHT

     UP and inside fire staircase, Emma and Steed run up -- Open the door to the
     conference room.  The CUCKOO RINGS on their entry.  To FIND an empty room.
     Only the party detritus plus little teddy bears sitting where formerly the big ones sat; the
     teddy bear picnic MUSIC PLAYING again OVER ...

     One snow shaker left.  Steed picks it up:  Inside it:


89      TINY EMMA PEEL

     in black leather.

                         STEED (O.S.)
               For you, Mrs. Peel.


90      BACK TO SCENE

     Emma stares at it.  Turns it over:  an address.

                         EMMA
               Another invitation. 38 Marlborough
               Terrace ...


91      INT.  EMBASSY (BELGRAVIA) - NIGHT

     Inside number 38, a deserted Eastern bloc embassy.  A dilapidated hammer and sickle
     tapestry in tatters.  Old spy techno-junk lies discarded in elegant living rooms.

     Steed and Emma open the door, rush inside.

     They search for clues.  A cigar left in an ashtray.  Steed picks it up with distaste. 
Then   moves over to the wine rack, picks up a vintage bottle of champagne --

                         STEED
                    (admiringly)
               Hm ... A Veuve-Cliquot '56 ...
                    (then puzzled)
               But he bites the end of his
               Monte Cristos ... ?
                    (frowning)
               Clearly, we're dealing with a
               maniac.

     Meanwhile, Emma goes into the --


92      NEXT ROOM - EMMA'S POV

     where she sees a blob of BUBBLING GUNK, like radioactive chewing gum.  A few
     pieces of charred clothing tell us this was once a man in a teddy bear outfit.


93      BACK TO SCENE

     Steed enters behind her, examines the gunk.

                         STEED
               Colonel Crabtree. International
               Satellite Systems. Formerly of
               the Ministry.

                         EMMA
               How on earth can you tell?

     Steed holds up the inside of a battered shoe:  the name.

                         STEED
               Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw
               isn't the only shoemaker still
               practicing his trade ...

                         EMMA
               Very good, Steed ...

     A MEWLING SOUND.

                         EMMA
               What's that?

     Leaving Steed to ponder the remains, Emma goes into


94      ANOTHER ROOM

     Dark.  Switches on the light.  And gasps.


95      STEED

     looks up as Emma emerges with - 

     A Leopard cub.  Steed raises his brolly.

                         STEED
               What on earth?

                         EMMA
               Any ideas?

                         STEED
               Well, he was a fellow of the Royal
               Zoological Society ...

                         EMMA
               Is that written in his shoe?

                         STEED
                    (smug)
               Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...

                         EMMA
                    (shrugs)
               She had this in her mouth. There,
               there...

     Cooing to the cub, Emma tosses to Steed -- another snowshaker.  Inside -- another
     address:  84 Cadogan Place.

                         STEED
               Not again.  There's got to be
               another. way to go about this.


96      EXT.  CADOGAN PLACE APARTMENT BUILDING (KNIGHTSBRIDGE) -
     NIGHT

     Down a sheer wall Emma Peel abseils with rope and crampons.  Before gliding through
     an open French window --


97      INT.  KNIGHTSBRIDGE FLAT - NIGHT

     Emma investigates.  Nobody there.  She looks 'round.  Military memorabilia.  Busts of
     Napoleon and Charlemagne.  Looks inside drawers.  Desks.  Meanwhile --


98      INT.  STEED'S JAG - NIGHT

     Steed feeds a carton of milk to the leopard, who is a handful ... licking, pawing him ...

                         STEED
               Now, now ...
                    (sings)
               'I can't give you anything but
               love, baby...'


99      INT.  KNIGHTSBRIDGE FLAT - NIGHT     

     Emma searching ...


100     OUTSIDE FLAT DOOR     100

          a key in lock.  Door opens.  Silence.


101     INSIDE - EMMA

     finds a snowshaker.  About to look underneath.  Hears a NOISE.  Looks up, in front of
     her in the mirror, sees -A giant teddy behind her.  Ready to strike --

     Emma swivels 'round,  a fluid balletic motion, and --

     Bam!  A kick to the teddy's stomach.  Then off balance, Emma hurls him over her
     shoulder, darts in to pin the teddy to the ground as --

     The teddy grabs Emma's legs, flings her off balance.  She falls.  Teddy grabs a military
     sabre from the wall, and Woosh!  Slices through air at Emma's head.  She ducks.  The
     sabre skims her hair.  Emma grabs another sabre; the fight is on!

     Emma counterattacks.  Slashes with the sabre and the teddy's head goes flying off! 
     Jesus.  The torso stands unsteadily.

     Emma's eyes widen as:

     A man's head emerges from the teddy torso.

     Emma's so surprised, he can slug her ...

     Emma's out.

102     INT.  STEED'S JAG - NIGHT

     so is Steed and the Leopard -- both asleep.  A little milk dribbles down Steed's chin ...


103     INT.  KNIGHTSBRIDGE FLAT - NIGHT

     The man goes to the other room.  Starts to take off the rest of his teddy costume. 
     Throws clothes into a suitcase.

     The PHONE.  Terrified, the Man picks it up ... The voice ...

                         VOICE (V.O.)

               But I've got rid of her.  She's ...

                    (filtered)
               Go to the window ... To the window.

     Teddy moves to the open window.  Sudden PAIN.  LIGHTNING.

     Teddy looks up in terror as a purple cloud releases another BOLT.  Direct hit.  The
     teddy slumps to the ground.  Soggy, waterlogged, very dead.  Kinda like the
     other guy ...


104     IN OTHER ROOM

     Meanwhile Emma wakes up. Turns the corner.  Towards the other room, sees dead
     Teddy.  Reads the label on his suitcase ...

                         EMMA
               Major D'Arcy ... ?


105     OVER HER SHOULDER

     from the window behind her like a spider on glass appears another "Emma" --

     -- let's call her Bad Emma -- coming straight for Emma.  She makes a NOISE.  Emma
     turns just in time to see.

                         EMMA
               Well, well. If it isn't me ...

     Emma starts towards her double, who hesitates, then turns, leaping out the window ...
     she wears the same black catsuit.

     The real Emma rushes, follows her "double"

     Clambers outside to rappel up the line to


106     EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

     Emma looks.  Beneath a starlit sky criss-crossed by wires, a rooftop maze of buildings,
     flanked by giant gargoyles -- goblins, lions, griffins -- over twinkling lights ...

     Emma searches the roof -- no sign, only shadows.  Then turns a corner to see --

     Above the city, fairy lights on the rooftops of Harrods, lit by a million bulbs ... giant
     neon signs ...

     Several floors below, Emma sees the streets.  A twinge of vertigo.  Then she looks up,
     hears a NOISE -- From:


107     BEHIND GARGOYLE

     she sees her "double" run.  Emma gives chase.

     Hot pursuit.  Over rooftops.  'Round wires.  PAST neon signs high over the city ...

     Emma follows.  Gains on the "double," who --

     Pushes faster.  Gliding between rooftop buildings.  Dodging, weaving.  But Emma
     gains more.  Sleek limbs, muscular, perfect body machine, until --


108     EMMA'S POV

     as she sees her "double" leap over a yawning chasm.  And stumble on the other side for
     a footing.


109     BACK TO SCENE

     as Emma's adrenaline surges.  She cannot stop, she --

     Jumps!  Hangs in the air.  Limbs pushing out for the edge.  And only just, she lands
     perfectly, gaining, closing, until --


110     ON NEXT ROOFTOP

     Emma gains up close.  A final burst of acceleration.  Then without warning, her
     "double" --

     Turns, Emma catches up, and --

     Wham!  Wham!  A kick -- a chop to Emma's body - double scissorkick -- Emma reacts
     swiftly, surges into overdrive --

     In a lightning-fast kung fu duel -- CRACK OF BONE -- CRUNCH OF BLOWS -- a
     flurry of kicks as Emma --

     Lands on her back.  The "double" attacks.  Emma retaliates --

     Kicks up her leg -- flings the "double" over her head she lands awkwardly -- a
     METALLIC CRUNCH in a blow to her head -- but picks herself up without pausing

     And vanishes into the rooftop maze.


111     AGAINST SKYLINE

     Emma stands.  Looks.   She's lost her "double."  She stands alone, silhouetted against
     the night sky.

     Caught in the moonlight.  Above sparks of neon.  Daunting, muscular, poised for
     action, as --

     Ears listening to distant noises.  SWOOSHING TRAFFIC.  FLUTTER of BIRD
     WING.  HUM of WIND through wires.  Then an AUDIBLE SNAP --

112     EMMA'S POV - HIGH ANGLE

     above her a SPAM as a STEEL CABLE WIRE of an aerial is snapped.  Slowly wound 
     tightly 'round, bent back, coiled, ready to spring --

113     BACK TO SCENE - EMMA

     looks 'round.  Sees nothing, hears the sound of the WHIPLASH coming seconds 
     before --

     Through the air --


114     EMMA'S POV

     a flashing line like a bolt of lightning, but cannot move quickly enough as --


115     BACK TO SCENE

     as a cable wire whips across, coils 'round Emma, lashing her tight, crushing air from
     her, as the wire --

     Sweeps Emma off her feet, whiplashes her back like a spring, hoists her and dangles her
     over the city.  She looks down.

     A long way.

     Emma grabs hold of the wire, which pulls her back.  She drops down to the rooftop ...

     Slithers down the roof.  Slips --


116     OVER LEDGE

     Emma hangs on with fingertips.

     Overlooking city with 100-foot neon sign above her:


117     ADVERTISEMENT

     for "Wonderland Weather" with: a repeated loop of a 100-foot high bikini-clad
     "Emma" throwing head back in holiday fun -- Sign: "COMING SOON -- THE
     NATURAL BEAUTY OF WONDERLAND WEATHER."


118     BACK TO SCENE

     Emma hangs on, looks up, stares at "herself."  The surreal repetition of the loop. 
     Overlooking the whole city.

     Dizzy, Emma threatens to pass out.  Just when from --


119     ABOVE HER

     an unseen hand from Bad Emma winds down --

     Another CABLE for her to hold.  It uncoils down past the windows, telltale SPARKS
     flare up as it hits metal --

     Emma tries to grab for it.  Misses, then grabs hold, and -- a LIVE CABLE -- a
     thousand VOLTS surge through her body --

     -- A shock, Emma plummets DOWN TO --


120     STRIPED AWNING

     on a lower ledge.  She hangs precariously.  Catching her breath.  About to redouble her
     efforts.  When beside her from a --


121     BALCONY WINDOW

     an umbrella extended.  Steed reaches out, reels Emma in.  They are back in Teddy's 
     flat ... Emma collapses in Steed's arms.  He helps her up -- hands her a phone.

                         STEED
               For you, Mrs. Peel.

                         EMMA
               Thanks ...
                    (dry)
               I see what you mean about letting
               me do the risking ... Hello?

     It's Sir August.

                         SIR AUGUST (V.O.)
                    (filtered)
               Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly.
               Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell
               you everything ... The weather's
               getting worse and worse ... they're
               after me ... coming for me ... come
               quickly!

     CLICK.

                         EMMA
               Sir August...?
                    (to Steed)
               What now?

                         STEED
               Ask Mother.

     Sound OVER:  RING-RING.

122     INT.  MANOR HOUSE (SCOTLAND) - DAY

     Sir August gripped with terror, stares at the PHONE.  The scotty DOG BARKS.
     Finally, Sir August answers.

                         SIR AUGUST
               Mrs. Peel -- ?

                         VOICE (V.O.)
                    (filtered)
               Ask not for whom the telephone
               rings ...

                         SIR AUGUST
               No, please! I beg you ...

                         VOICE (V.O.)
                    (filtered)
               Walk over to the window ...

                         SIR AUGUST
               Let it be rain, please let it be --

                         VOICE (V.O.)
                    (filtered)
               Stay by the window. By the window.

     Mesmerized, Sir August goes to the window. Looks -- Lady June arrives, too late.


123     OUTSIDE

     a purple cloud of cyclone-force rages towards him.  A luminous glow.  Then a
     LIGHTNING STRIKE. And --

     BOOM!  An EXPLOSION BLASTS the WINDOWS.  A WIND rushes
     in ...

                         FATHER (V.O.)
               Emergency alert ...


124     EXT.  WHITEHALL STREETS - DAY

     PAST obscure imperial statues a tiny micro Messerschmidt bubble car tootles down
     deserted streets.

                         FATHER (V.O.)
               A cyclone hit Banffshire last night.
               Completely unpredicted ...


125     INSIDE CAR

                         EMMA
               Where's Mother?

                         FATHER
               Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't 
               take chances. I'm looking after 
               things while he's hiding out ...

     Father drives like a maniac.  She senses their unease.

                         FATHER
               You're probably wondering how I 
               can drive 'blind.' Simple. A new 
               prototype from the boys in X division.  
               Micro-sensors in the system read 
               signals and road information. Converts 
               the info into miles per hour. 
               Ultra-sensitive.  Ultra-smart.

     Father jumps a red light.  CARS SCREECH together in a huge pile-up.  Not that smart. 
     Steed holds onto his hat.

                         STEED
               We know one thing. That suspect
               was not Mrs. Peel.

                         FATHER
               So you say ... 

                         EMMA
               You don't believe him?

                         FATHER
               It's Mother you have to convince.
               He's very agitated.  Wait here.

     Father SCREECHES to a halt on Holland Park Avenue

     Steed and Emma get out.  Father takes off ...

                         EMMA
               But

                         STEED
               Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...

     A red London number 22 bus drives up.  As it arrives, in a conductor's cap is -- the
     bodyguard, Brenda.

                         BRENDA
               Fares, please,


126     INT.  BUS - DAY

     Steed and Emma board the bus.  Destination:  Not In Service.  They pay Brenda, the
     conductor.  Go upstairs.


127     UPSTAIRS

     is Mother's temporary mobile HQ.  He squats in a corner.  Metal hooks on electronic
     panels.  Now paranoid.  Suspicious.  All the upper windows have been blacked out.

                         MOTHER
               Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's 
               turning quite nasty. Sir August was 
               blown to smithereens. Along with 
               half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's 
               worried.

                         EMMA
               He tried to warn us ...

                         STEED
               We had a lead to Wonderland
               Weather but we got there too late.
               Someone tipped them off ...

                         MOTHER
               Too late anyway. Today's escapade 
               was only for starters. This is no 
               ordinary weather. It's manmade. A 
               kind of weather bomb.

                         STEED
               Impossible.

                         EMMA
               Not quite. This is my field.

                         STEED
               Is there anything that isn't?

                         EMMA
                    (ignores)
               The Prospero Project was started by 
               my husband. It was an early attempt 
               to solve the problems of global warming.  
               In theory, climate engineering is entirely 
               feasible. We thought of injecting a 
               chemical cocktail into the atmosphere 
               by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...

                         STEED
               Filling in mother nature's blind
               spots ... ?

                         EMMA
               Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts 
               to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea.  
               Propane gas mostly. In small quantities 
               it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone 
               layer. But it proved impractical. 
               Too bulky ...

                         STEED
               But if someone miniaturized the
               process...

                         EMMA
               That's what we were working on.

                         STEED
               Sounds as if someone's hijacked
               your research.

                         MOTHER
               Would it be possible to use it for
               military purposes?

                         EMMA
               Directed by laser. Bounced by
               satellite. Quite possible.

                         STEED
               Where would they aim for?

     Mother thinks, gets out of his wheelchair; takes a turn about the bus, sits down again. 
     No one pays any attention.

                         MOTHER
               London. The World Council of Ministers 
               meets soon on global defence. If you can 
               control the weather, you control the world.

                         EMMA
               After the cold war ...

                         STEED
               The hot and cold war ...

     Sign "Grand Opening Soon."  WIDEN to reveal ...


128     EXT.  WONDERLAND WEATHER OFFICES - DAY

     Steed looks around, picks the lock ... hi-tech style ...


129     INT.  WONDERLAND WEATHER OFFICES - DAY

     A kind of space-age travel agency.  Steed enters.

     At the reception desk, the receptionist has her back turned.  Steed sneaks in, moves
     behind a screen, overhears --

     A man -- Bailey -- giving orders to the receptionist

                         BAILEY
               New orders. The penultimate phase. 
               Now fully operational ...

     Steed moves away from them, pushes a set of double doors open, arrives inside --


130     INT.  WONDERLAND OFFICE - DISPLAY - DAY

     A long corridor surrounded by a presentation of --

     Virtual reality weather:  clouds, sunny vistas, lush meadows, desert.  And slogans: 
     "Be natural.  Act natural.  Think natural.  The natural beauty of Wonderland Weather."

     Steed reacts; the model is the same as Emma on the big neon sign near Harrods ...

     Steed finds a desk.  Inspects papers.  Sees a postcard of a large stately home.  He
     pockets it.  Then looks 'round to see --

     Bailey before him.  We recognize him as the young dandy trailing Steed.  Neither gives
     away the other.

                         BAILEY
               We're not yet open for business,
               I'm afraid.

                         STEED
               Shame. I was recommended. By a
               friend.

                         BAILEY
               Really?

                         STEED
               Sir August Merryweather? I was
               looking for something relaxing.
               Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?

                         BAILEY
               Normally, we'd be eager to
               oblige --

                         STEED
               Seriously?  

                         BAILEY
               Of course. Natural weather delivered
               to your door on demand. Down your
               phoneline. For limited periods.

                         STEED
               You don't say. How real does it feel?

                         BAILEY
               As real as you wish. Hot or cold.
               Humid or dry. Anything you like.
               Within reason.

                         STEED
               There are limits?

                         BAILEY
               The technology is brand new. Soon 
               it will be more powerful. We 
               anticipate a huge demand. Leave us 
               your number. We'll be in touch.

                         STEED
               No need. I'll call again.

     Steed raises his bowler.  Bailey watches him go.


131     EXT.  WONDERLAND OFFICES - STREET - DAY

     Steed emerges, stares at his postcard -- the stately home and:  
     "Headquarters, Wonderland Weather, Ltd." as --

                         EMMA (V.O.)
               My car. I'll drive.


132     EXT.  COUNTRY ROADS - DAY

     Emma's LOTUS ELAN WHIZZES BY...

                         STEED (V.O.)
               A day in the country ...


133     INT.  LOTUS - DAY

                         EMMA
               Three agents killed by bad weather...

                         STEED
               ... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...

                         EMMA
                    (ignores)
               Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret 
               defense establishment. A group of 
               eccentrics obsessed by weather ...

                         STEED
               ... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything 
               points to you.  No sisters?  No 
               undiscovered twin?

                         EMMA
               Not that I know of.  Explanation?

                         STEED
               According to Dr. Darling, you're a 
               psychopathic personality with 
               schizophrenic delusions, suffering from 
               recurring amnesia based on traumatic 
               repression, leading to outbursts of 
               anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.

     Steed lets it sink in.  Emma looks a little hurt.

                         EMMA
               Is that what you think?

                         STEED
               Oh, well ...
                    (beat)
               Just my type, Mrs. Peel.


134     EXT.  COUNTRY LANES - SEVERAL ANGLES - DAY

     The Lotus races 'round blind corners.  Hairpin bends.  Across a train at a level crossing,
     which just misses them --


135     INT. LOTUS - DAY

     Emma sees Steed hold on for dear life. She smirks --

                         STEED
               Do you always drive this fast?

                         EMMA
               Have I trespassed on a male
               prerogative?
                    (before his reply)
               We're being followed. I saw him
               at Trubshaw's ...

     Steed looks into the mirror, sees a car behind them.  Pulling up, trying to catch up.
     Emma glances in the mirror, and --

                         EMMA
               Hold on ...

     Puts foot down.  ZOOM.  Extra ACCELERATION.  Steed's head pinned back to his
     seat.  Emma's hair tossed in the wind.


136     EXT.  COUNTRY LANES - DAY

     The Lotus twisting and turning.  The car behind always catches up.  Emma tries to
     shake it.  Gears up.  Mach force.  Over crossroads.  Shaking 'round corners, as ...


137     BEND

     before Emma pushes foot down.  Further ACCELERATION.  The car behind struggles
     to keep up.  Emma coasts ahead, turns a corner --

     And suddenly sees in front of her --


138     HUGE TRUCK

     crossing directly in their path!

                         STEED
               Turn!


139     EMMA

     swerves, plunging the car into a haystack, where it is completely hidden as --


140     TRUCK

     clears in time for the following car, which keeps going.


141     ON HAYSTACK

     as Steed emerges, brushing off straw.  An old lady on a bicycle with a basket appears ...

                         OLD LADY
               Are you alright, young man?

                         STEED
               I think so, thank you so much ...

     A SQUEAL of TIRES as -

     The following car swerves back, stops and Bailey emerges, gun drawn as Steed and the
     Old Lady react ...

                         BAILEY
                    (relishing)
               Reach for the sky, pardner.

     Steed raises his hands.

                         OLD LADY
               Oh, dear --

     To Steed's surprise, she pulls an Uzi from her basket and

     BANGBANGBANGBANG -- !  SPRAYS BULLETS into Bailey, who crumples, gun
     spinning along the tarmac.  Cute and sweetlooking, the Old Lady is unfazed.

                         OLD LADY
               Cocky little bastard. I hope he
               was a baddy.

                         STEED
               I feel sure of it.

                         OLD LADY
               I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be
               on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?

                         STEED
                    (looks around)
               She was ...

     They start pulling away hay from the haystack ...

                         OLD LADY
               You with Mother or Father?

                         STEED
               Both, actually.

                         OLD LADY
               Good. Glad to see they're together at last.  
               They don't get along. Promotion. Top job.  
               Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.

                         STEED
                    (not paying attention)
               You don't say.
                    (mumbles)
               Like looking for a needle in a ...


142     INSIDE HAYSTACK

     Coughing.  Then Emma, sputtering straw as Steed's face appears.  He tries to conceal
     his relief at seeing her.

                         STEED
               What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet
               breathing?

                         EMMA
               Barely.

                         STEED
               You will let me know if you find
               that queen who's in need of
               protection, won't you?

     He pulls her out.  She's annoyed.

143     OUTSIDE HAYSTACK

     Emma brushes herself off; pulls off a piece of straw.

                         EMMA
                    (holding it ruefully)
               This must be the last straw.

                         STEED
                    (takes one off
                    her back)
               Here's the one that broke the
               camel's back.

                         EMMA
               Someone didn't want us to get to
               the party.

                         STEED
               I expect we'll have to gatecrash.

                         OLD LADY
               I may be able to help you.


144     EXT.  STATELY HOME FROM POSTCARD - DAY

     comes to life.  Steed, Emma and the Old Lady survey ...

                         STEED
                    (checks postcard)
               Wonderland Weather Ltd.

                         OLD LADY
               This way ...


145     EXT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL - GROTTO AND MAZE - DAY

     On a lawn, a peacock flares its thousand eye tail.  A MECHANICAL CLICK, its eyes
     conceal hidden cameras, recording Emma, Steed and the Old Lady, who've landed
     inside the walled grounds.  They move stealthily forward, unaware ...

                         OLD LADY
               Over here ...

     The Old Lady waves them on.  They enter a tunnel into


146     MAZE

     Tall hedges surround Steed and Emma and the Old Lady on all sides.  They follow the
     path, slopes , round, curves, turns into hairpin bends and U-turns.  At first intrigued ...

     Then perplexed.  Emma leads the way, Steed following.  The Old Lady slips OUT OF
     VIEW.  Steed stops to pick a rose, puts it in his lapel.  Emma rushes ahead.

                         EMMA
               Aha ... Yes ... It's clear now. A
               trapezoid shape, dictated by twin
               diagonal paths and a single
               curving path. A late Seventeenth
               Century design, originally for
               King William of Orange, copied...
               Ah ...

     Steed sees Emma slip 'round a corner.  He pursues her.  Glimpses her.  Then loses her.
     Another glimpse.  Sees her thru hedges, then seemingly --

     Thru the other side of the hedge.  In two places at once.

                         STEED
               ... Mrs. Peel? I think I'm seeing
               double again.

     Out of sight, Emma rushes on.  Around her, the hedges grow taller.  She seems to
     grow smaller.  Emma begins to realize things are not what they seem.  As she pushes
     her way thru --


147     FROM ABOVE

     the maze as a formal patter-n. Three tiny figures dart round.

                                             
     DISSOLVE THRU TO:


148     INT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

     A pattern on a screen.  The lines of the maze reformulated as abstract lines.  Steed,
     Emma and the Old Lady as three flashing dots.  Someone, somewhere is watching
     them.  Laughter, then a familiar voice --

                         VOICE (O.S.)
               Now this is more like it ...


149     EXT.  MAZE - DAY

     Steed searches for an exit.


150     ANOTHER PART OF MAZE

     Emma sees a statue of a Butler.  Which springs to life.  Summons Emma.  She follows
     down a path strewn with leaves.

     As Emma steps on the leaves, she --

     Falls down -- a giant rabbit hole.


151     INT.  RABBIT HOLE

     Emma spins through darkness, like Alice in Wonderland ...

                         EMMA
               Steed ... !

                         STEED (V.O.)
               Mrs. Peel ... ?


152     EXT.  MAZE - DAY

     The identical face of Emma on a marble statue, as --

     Steed studies the classical statue ...

                         STEED
               Mrs. Peel ... ?

     Steed hears a noise, turns to see --

     Emma walking towards him.  She picks the rose from his lapel, slowly coils an arm
     around his neck.  Pulls Steed towards her, closes her eyes -- kisses him full an the
     mouth.

                         STEED
               Mrs. Peel ... !
                    (more kiss)
               Mrs. Peel ...

     The kiss ends.  Steed recovers his composure, lips coated with her lipstick.  His tongue
     traces his lips; smarts ...

                         STEED
               Your lipstick ...

     Poison.  He goes dizzy.  Steed collapses to the ground.


153     INT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL - DAY

     Inside the house, a grand hall.  Deserted.  A cobweb hangs from ceiling.  A velvet
     curtain tattered and torn.
     Emma.

     A CUCKOO CLOCK RINGS the hour.  Ahead, the real Emma sees --

     A giant staircase.  There on the stairs -- a glass eye.
     She picks it up.  Puts it in a pocket.  Emma goes --


154     UPSTAIRS

     Sees a series of family portraits an the staircase.  One of herself in ornate aristocratic
     regalia.


155     LONG CORRIDOR UPSTAIRS

     Rooms on either side.  Emma goes down the hall, pushes doors.


156     INSIDE ROOMS

     A mad child's collections of ... toys... rocking horses ... train sets ... ventriloquists'
     dummies... and ...

     Butterflies ... scarabs ... beetles ... glass eyes, staring at her from the blackness ...

     Then Emma turns into a whole room of ...

     Snow shakers ... A wall of them in glass cabinets like insect specimens or fossils. 
     Emma picks up one snow scene.

     She shakes it.


157     EXT.  HOUSE

     as if in response, a storm gathers.  Shadowy clouds roll in.


158     IN MAZE

     A drop of rain starts to fall.  Steed's eyes flicker open.

                         STEED
                    (re: rain)
               Not again.

     He rises, looks down, reacts --

     Alice, the Old Lady, lies near him in the maze, her neck snapped... Steed kneels, next to
     her in the rain

                         OLD LADY
               It's a trap. Tell Mother, beware.
               Tell Father.

     She dies in his arms.

     Wind picks up, too.

     Steed looks about, frowning with discouragement --


159     INT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL   PLAYROOM - DAY

     THUNDER and lightning outside.  Inside the room of snow shakers, a CHILDHOOD
     TUNE PLAYS.  Emma shakes the snow scene.  The weather seems to grow darker.


160     FROM BEHIND

     Emma hears the unmistakable chilling voice:

                         VOICE (V.O.)
               I wouldn't shake that too hard.
               The weather might turn nasty.

     From the shadows ... a man.  A silhouette.  Behind a distorting lens.  His shape and
     face unclear.  Emma puts down the shaker.

                         EMMA
               Quite a collection.

                         VOICE (V.O.)
               If nature gives a man a collector's mind, 
               it doesn't matter what he collects.  
               Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. 
               A true collector grows more obsessive 
               as the years pass.

     Outside the big window the weather is turning nasty ...

                         EMMA
               Your voice -- it's so familiar ...

                         VOICE (V.O.)
               We have met ...

     From the shadows, a man moves out, revealing:

     Peter Peel, Emma's husband!  THUNDER.

                         EMMA
               Peter ... ?

     Instinctively Emma moves towards him.  A long pause.

                         EMMA
               I must be dreaming ...

     Emma pulls back.  Before she can turn, Peter takes her hand, places it over his heart. 
     BA-BOOM, BA-BOOM, BA-BOOM ...

                         PETER
               Listen... Very much alive.

     Peter touches her hand.  Emma looks into his eyes.  Intrigued but alarmed, disbelief. 
     Peter raises her hand to his lips.

                         PETER
               Darling, it's me...

     Emma shudders, battles with herself.

                         EMMA
               Peter ...

     Emma is tempted, yet filled with terror.


161     CLOSEUP - EMMA'S EYES

     Inside her pupil --

                                             
          FLASH CUTS TO:


162     MEMORY FLASHES

     His face as he kissed her -- his ring on her finger -the visor cracking -- the glass
     obscuring his face.


163     BACK TO SCENE

                         EMMA
               Impossible ... how?

     Peter smiles disarmingly.  As if the answer was obvious.

                         PETER
               For you ... all for you ...

     Peter comes over, folds her in his arms.  Takes her head between his hands.  Emma
     leans over to him, about to kiss him, both closing their eyes, until --

     Lips parted.  Before they kiss, Emma pulls back --

                         PETER
               Don't be afraid, darling.

     She turns, runs to the door.  Like a trapped bird.  She tries the door -- locked.  Another
     door -- locked.  A window -- locked.

                         PETER
               Don't run away. I forgive you, 
               Emma. I know you left me. But 
               I still love you. Do you still have 
               my ring? I need it.

     Peter grabs hold of Emma.  She pulls away.  Emma sees his face before her, pleading
     with her.  Seductive yet nightmarish.

     As if hallucinating, Emma runs away, towards --

     The big window overlooking the gardens.  She runs, leaps, and in SLOW MOTION --

     Crashes thru the GLASS, shards and splinters SHATTERING all 'round her, as she --


164     EXT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL - WINDOW - DAY

     somersaults through the window down to the ground.  Lands with a THUD on the wet
     ground.  Looks up to see --

     Steed above her, the STORM RAGING.

                         EMMA
               Steed!

     She struggles to her feet, comes towards him, upset.

                         STEED
               Oh, no. First time, shame on
               you. Third time, shame on me.

     He slugs her and the SCREEN GOES BLACK.

                         DR. DARLING (V.O.) 
               Diagnosis confirmed.  Mrs. Peel is 
               suffering from delusions and 
               hallucinations. An extreme personality 
               disorder. She imagines her husband 
               Peter Peel has come back to her ...

     CLOSE ON Emma's face.

                         DR. DARLING (V.O.) 
               A classic syndrome, to overcome her 
               subconscious guilt at her other crimes.  
               We've attached her to the dreamscape 
               machine. We'll soon see what her 
               unconscious looks like...

     Emma's eyes flicker...

     Steed comes INTO FOCUS, sitting by Emma's bed.  This time he's eating her grapes ...

     Emma looks around ... Everything blurs.  A STEADY PULSE DRONE.  Tugs at
     leather straps.  No use.  WIDEN to reveal Emma strapped to a special couch --

     Her head surrounded by a plastic dome, terminals and wires leading out into a
     Dreamscape machine.  Drowsy, disoriented.

                         EMMA
               Where am I?

                         STEED
               The Winslow Home for Retired
               Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry
               I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please
               forgive me. I thought you were
               someone else ...

                         EMMA
               Was I?

                         STEED
                    (no smile)
               I expect that's for you to know
               and me to find out ...

                         EMMA
               It was Peter -- I saw him ...

     Drugged, Emma's eyes drop.  FOCUS CHANGES TO --


165     ABOVE HER

     A giant spiral HYPNODISC WHIRRS, creating trippy black and white zig zag op-art
     effects a la Bridget Riley.

     She blinks.

                                             
          DISSOLVE TO:


166     SAME SCENE - LATER

     Steed is gone.  Dr. Darling leans over her.  Emma stares at the hypnodisc.  Closes her
     eyes.


167     EXTREME CLOSEUP ON HER EYES

     Thousand REMs per sec -- a tiny chip next to her eyes, transmitting out via wires to --


168     UP ON WALL

     A "Dreamscape" apparatus like a liquid TV screen flicks thru random images from
     Emma's unconscious.  Peter Peel -- Teddy Bears -- post card views -- childhood 
     snaps --


169     BESIDE "BED"

     Dr. Darling furls his hand over Emma's, his fingers resting upon her ring.  During the
     interrogation, he soothingly strokes her hand -- tries to remove the ring without
     arousing her suspicion.  Pulls gently on it.


170     UP IN GALLERY

     In his wheelchair, Mother sits beside Steed.

                         MOTHER
               This man -- did you see him?

                         STEED
               No. Her husband, she says. Alice
               tried to warn us. A trap. Tell
               Mother beware. Tell Father
               That's all.


171     BY COUCH

     Dr. Darling leans forward to interrogate Emma.


172     FROM HER POV

     He looks and sounds sinister.  From a corner of her eye, she sees -- a clip of keys
     hanging from his pocket.


173     BACK TO SCENE

                         DR. DARLING
               I want you to say the first thing
               that comes into your head when I
               say these words. Do you
               understand ... ?
                    (as she nods)

                         EMMA
               ... death ...

     Steed watching, listening ...

                         DR. DARLING
               Flower ...

                         EMMA
               ... power ...

     The exchange speeds up.  Unknown to Dr. Darling, Emma picks his keys; unlocks her
     straps.

                         DR. DARLING
               Nature ...

                         EMMA

               Peter ...

     As Emma talks, the "Dreamscape" plucks images from her unconscious in trippy
     psychedelic rush:  faces -- colors -- patterns flash past.

                         EMMA
               ... Piper picked a peck of pickled 
               peppers how many pecks of pickled 
               peppers did Peter Peel -- ?


174     CLOSEUP - EMMA

     Quietly unclicks a lock.  She stops in mid-gabble.

                         EMMA
               How long have I been here?

                         DR. DARLING
               Three days.

     Emma unlocks her straps.  Sits Up.  Woozy.

                         EMMA
               Do you get paid by the hour?

     Dr. Darling is shocked, indignant.  Emma rips wires from her body.  The "Dreamscape"
     machine winds down.  Up in the gallery --

     BAM -- !  Mother bashes his metal cane on the railings

                         MOTHER
                    (filtered)
               You are here under observation, 
               Mrs. Peel. You must answer Dr. 
               Darling's questions

     Pushes Dr. Darling aside.

                         EMMA
               I resign.

                         MOTHER
                    (filtered)
               You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You
               can't resign.

                         EMMA
               Watch me.

     Emma staggers.  Mother looks at Steed.  Who snaps himself out of staring at the
     hypnodisc.

     Emma heads for the airlock door marked:

     "ANTI-GRAVITY CHAMBER -- NO ADMITTANCE"

                         MOTHER
               Don't open that, Mrs. Peel!

     Fat chance ... she goes in ...


175     INT.  ANTI-GRAVITY CHAMBER

     Emma floats in the air, as Mother, Dr. Darling and Steed all follow.  And float
     helplessly, turning around madly.  Trying to gain on Emma.  Mother's wheelchair,
     Steed's umbrella and bowler, all tumble thru the air as Steed tries to reach the "OFF"
     switch

                         EMMA
                    (echoing)
               What are you trying to do to me?

                         MOTHER
                    (flailing)
               We want to help...!

                         EMMA
               I thought I was a widow. My
               husband ... the only man I ever
               loved ... is dead. For the rest
               of my life I have to live with
               that.

                         MOTHER
               The death of Peter Peel was a
               great loss. To us all ...

                         EMMA
               To you ... ?

     Mother looks at Emma.  He's let the cat out the bag.  Steed finds the "OFF" switch.
     They all tumble to the floor, Mother landing perfectly in his wheelchair,
     Steed effortlessly catching his hat and umbrella.  He moves to Mother --

                         STEED
               I think you owe Mrs. Peel an
               explanation ...

     Steed stares Mother out.  Who delivers his revelations.

                         MOTHER
               Peter Peel was a first class agent.
               A senior operative.
               'X' department Special operations.  
               He was engaged in top secret research.  
               Top priority.  Government approved.

                         EMMA
               The Institute ... the funding ...

                         MOTHER
               A cover ... for us.
                    (beat)
               I'm sorry...

     A turning moment for Emma.  A life lived on a lie.

                         EMMA
               So all that time. Our work, our research 
               was for you ... for this? And the 
               accident --

                         DARLING
               It was no accident.

                         EMMA
               The official investigation ...

                         MOTHER
               ... was written by me.
                    (beat)
               It was sabotage, Mrs. Peel.

     Deadly serious, Emma walks over to him.

                         EMMA
               Who?

                         MOTHER
               Quite frankly ... it could have
               been you.

     Silence.  Emma looks away, shocked.  Steed intervenes

                         STEED
               You're accusing Mrs. Peel of
               killing her own husband?

                         MOTHER
               Her husband suspected someone very 
               close to the operation. On the day he 
               died, he was setting a test.
               To prove to himself -- to us that his 
               wife was beyond suspicion. He had to 
               be certain. He said he was going to 
               give Mrs. Peel something ...

     Emma keeps staring at Mother, fingers her diamond ring.

                         MOTHER
               ... I want you to remember. Did
               Peter give you anything on-that 
               day?


176     CLOSEUP - EMMA

     touches her ring.


177     BACK TO SCENE

     Emma looks up at Mother.  A barefaced lie.

                         EMMA
               No.

     Steed notices Emma touch her ring nervously.

                         DR. DARLING
               He said if it vanished, he'd know
               it was ... you who betrayed him.
               He took a huge risk. The ultimate
               test.

                         EMMA
               So I'm still ...

                         MOTHER
               Under suspicion. Everyone died in 
               the explosion, Mrs. Peel. You were 
               the only survivor ...

     Mother waits.  Emma turns round.  Looks fiercely at him.  Mother shifts uneasily as
     Emma walks past him to the airlock.

                         MOTHER
               This is an official matter, Mrs.
               Peel. No need to take it
               personally. Where are you going?

                         EMMA
               To find out who killed my husband.

                         MOTHER
               The doors and walls are monitored, 
               Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure 
               establishment.

                         EMMA
               So am I.

     Emma pushes open the doors.  Walks out.  Down a corridor.  Dr. Darling grabs
     Mother, as he exits with Steed --

                         DR. DARLING
               She must remain here. She's
               highly dangerous.


178     IN HALL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Mother exits with Steed; they watch Emma going ...

                         MOTHER
               Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs.
               Peel. Unfortunately --

                         STEED
               Guilty until proven innocent?

                         MOTHER
               Mother and Father know best.

     Mother wheels himself off.  Then stops; over his shoulder:

                         MOTHER
               Something quick. Nothing too ...
               messy.

     ON Steed.  CAR ROAR over as --


179     EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE CLINIC - DAY

     Emma drives a hot-wired Morris Minor out the open gates of the manor house, past a
     sign which reads:

     "WINSLOW HOME FOR RETIRED LEPIDOPTORISTS" (Butterfly logo)

     In the b.g., a couple of old-timers race around with butterfly nets as Steed's jag pulls
     past them in hot pursuit.


180     EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

     Emma speeds down lanes ...

     Followed at a safe distance by Steed in his SS100.


181     INT.  STEED'S JAG - DAY

     Steed looks: a bleep on his radar screen tracks the --

     on Emma's shoulder as she drives ...


183     EXT.  LANES - DAY

     The cars whiz past ...


184     INT.  STEED'S JAG - DAY

     Keeping an eye on his radar and the road, Steed switches on the radio.  The weather
     forecast:

                         RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    (filtered)
               '... Sunny intervals leading to
               sudden storms and gale warnings
               for all areas.
                    (as he frowns)
               ... Outbursts of rain, scattered
               hailstorms and freezing fog
               greeted the World Council of
               Ministers as they arrived in
               London for their conference ...'

     Emma drives into a churchyard.  Steed follows her ...


185     INT.  COUNTRY CHURCH - DAY     

     A medieval country church.  Sunlight streams through stained glass, illumining Emma
     as Steed watches her lay --

     A red rose by an altar tomb:  an ornate mausoleum two hands clasped in a pose of
     eternal sleep:  Peter Peel.

     Emma pauses, as in the b.g., choirboys sing hymn practice.  Steed watches Emma move
     away, toward the door.  He drops a hymn book.  Emma swivels round -- sees Steed.

                         EMMA
               You followed me.

                         STEED
               Orders.

                         EMMA
               To kill me?

                         STEED
                    (fractional pause)
               Nothing personal.

     Emma smiles. Then turns, and --

     Runs!  Steed follows Emma through a door to --


186     INT.  CHURCH BELL TOWER - DAY

     Steed enters, glimpses --

     Emma above.  He follows her.  Hears her footsteps.  Trip- trapping up the spiral
     staircase.  Steed listens, follows.


187     UP BELLTOWER

     From below, Steed hears a BELL RING.  A FLUTTER of BIRDS.  As debris falls
     down -- Steed runs up stairs, reaches --


188     EXT.  BELLTOWER TOP - DAY

     BELL still RINGING.  At the top, a sheer drop.  Steed edges closer to the ledge. 
     Looks.  A long way down.
     From behind --

                         EMMA
               A long way down.

     Steed swivels.  Sees Emma blocking his path.  Cool menace.  Steed steps away from
     the edge, Emma circles him.

                         STEED
               Careful. You might fall.

     Emma steps to the edge.  Steed freezes.  Emma locks down.  Feet resting on the ledge. 
     Rocking to and fro ...

                         EMMA
               I could save you the trouble.

                         STEED
               No trouble.

                         EMMA
               Because you always obey orders ...

                         STEED
               Always.
                    (pause)
               Except ...

     Steed nears her.  Emma pushes herself right to the edge.

                         EMMA
               Yes ... ?

                         STEED
               ... when I don't. It comes down to one 
               thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.

     Steed reaches out for her.  Holds out his hand.

                         EMMA
               And do you trust me?

                         STEED
               I could be convinced, if ... I knew who 
               poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...

                         EMMA
               It wasn't me; you have my word.

     Steed snatches her from the edge, holds her in his arms.

                         STEED
               I need proof.

     Emma thinks.  Looks at him.  Deadly serious.  Their eyes lock.  She hesitates, then
     pecks him on the cheek.

                         STEED
               It was longer. On the lips.

     Emma hesitates.  Then a kiss on the lips.  Longer.  But not much.  Steed grabs her
     hand, pulls her back.

                         STEED
               Much longer.  Approximately ...
               fifteen seconds.

     Emma harumphs, exasperated.  Moves closer to him.

                         EMMA
               ... Ready?

     Steed nods.  Emma leans forward.  A full kiss.  At first reticent ... Emma looks at her
     watch.  Counts seconds ...

                         EMMA
               ... Four ... seven ... ni-...

     Then ... forgets.  Warmer, more relenting.  Edging towards passionate.  They stay
     embracing for fifteen seconds ...

                         EMMA
                    (aroused)
               Mmm ... what are you doing?

                         STEED
               Keeping a stiff upper lip?

                         EMMA
               Is that all?

     The kiss continues couple of seconds longer.  Before Emma withdraws.  With an effort,
     she regains her composure.  A long silence.

                         EMMA
               So I'm in the clear?

     Steed savors the kiss.  No reply.  His smile says it all.

                         EMMA
               But you did suspect me.

                         STEED
               Not for a moment.

                         EMMA
               You're playing games.

                         STEED
               Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?

                         EMMA
               I thought you played by the rules.

                         STEED
               I thought you didn't.

                         EMMA
               I'm playing to win.

                         STEED
               Winning isn't everything.

                         EMMA
               Please don't tell me it's how you
               play the game.

                         STEED
                    (smiles; stands
                    aside)
               After you -- Mrs. Peel ...

     Steed motions down the stairs.  It's close to the edge.

                         EMMA
               No, after you.

                         STEED
                    (back to square
                    one)
               You don't trust me?

                         EMMA
               As far as you trust me.

     Emma motions.  Steed goes down, passes close to the edge, and swivels round
     nervously.  Emma reads his thoughts.

                         EMMA
               When it happens, Steed, you'll be
               the first to know ...

     With this comforting thought, Steed descends first.


189     EXT.  CHURCH TOWER - DAY

     As Steed and Emma exit from the tower, they see --

     A tranquil village scene.  Choirboys walk out from the church.  Nearby in the deserted
     village street.  A red PHONE BOX.  Which ...

     RING-RING ... Starts to RING.

                         EMMA
               Who could that be?

     A ROLL of THUNDER.  Steed looks up: a clear sky.  He's puzzled.  Suddenly
     suspicious.  As Emma moves to the phone.

                         STEED
               No -- don't answer it ...

     He pulls her back.  Emma looks at him.

                         STEED
               That's it. The phones trigger
               the explosions --

     RING-RING ... Another ROLL of THUNDER.  Steed connects the two as -- an
     angelic CHOIRBOY walks towards the phone ...

     RING-RING ... A LOUDER ROLL of THUNDER.  As the Choirboy nears the
     PHONE, Steed shouts --

                         STEED
          Don't -- don't answer it -- !


190     CLOSEUP - PHONE

     RING-RING -- the PHONE in the f.g. as the choirboy closes in, opens the door --


191     INSIDE PHONE BOX

     The door shuts.  Noise muffled.  The Choirboy can't hear Steed and Emma's shouted
     warnings, as he lifts his hand up, and --


192     OUTSIDE

     Steed sees him reach out, warns the vicar and choirboys.

                         STEED
               Get down -- get down -- it's
               going to explode -- !

     Steed and Emma, all the choirboys hit the dirt, as


193     INSIDE PHONE BOX

     The Choirboy grabs the phone, and lifts it up, and

     Silence.

     No explosion.  A few seconds pass.  Steed and everyone
     are down on the ground.  As they see --


194     FROM PHONE BOX     

     -- the Choirboy leaves the phone hanging.  He gets out, scans the crowd.  Then walks
     calmly over to Steed, who's still prone.

                         CHOIRBOY
               It's your mother.

     The vicar and choirboys look on sympathetically, as --

     Steed dusts himself off.  Emma and everyone gets up.  Steed goes to the phone box,
     takes the call.

                         STEED
               Mother? How did you find me?

     His expression changes as he listens.  Emma goes to the phone box as Steed rings off.
     He emerges from the box.

                         STEED
               I told Mother I took care of you.

                         EMMA
               You lied.

                         STEED
               I equivocated. But you're not
               their big worry at present. It's
               Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...

     OFF Emma's reaction to this news --


195     INT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL - DAY

     Inside the upper room, in front of a mirror --

     With his back turned to us.  Dr. Darling holds something in his hand, and waits as --


196     DOWN LONG HALL

     Bad "Emma" walks over.  She stands in front of him.

     Blank expression.  Dr. Darling hardly even looks up.  With her hair up, we recognize
     on her neck a tattoo:  Z424.

                         DR. DARLING
               We are in the final phase. I shall require 
               you to be especially obedient. There 
               must be no failures.


197     CLOSEUP - IN HIS HANDS - SNOWSHAKER

     which he grips tightly. As --


198     IN MIRROR

     a metamorphosis.  His features melt and bubble, a mask of plastic surgery and it's
     slipping around like Michael Jackson's face under kleig lights.  He adjusts it, then ...

     Shakes the snowshaker ...


199     EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

     THUNDER as the sky darkens -- PAN DOWN to reveal:

     Steed's Jag, zooming through country lanes.  Rain starts.


200     INT.  JAG - DAY

     Steed driving, winces with the drizzle.

                         STEED
               Drat. Someone wants to implicate
               you in this affair, Mrs. Peel.
               Any idea who?

                         EMMA
               No idea who. No idea why ...

                         STEED
                    (thinks)
               Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys
               All children's things ...

                         EMMA
               ... Or grown-ups, who still like
               to be children.

                         STEED
               Quite. Any childhood friends?
               Enemies?

                         EMMA
               Not to speak of. Peter and I
               were both loners. There was
               nobody.

     Steed thinks; sighs.

                         STEED
               Very well. I have a friend who
               might be of assistance. He's at
               the Ministry. We'd better be
               careful.

                         EMMA
               I'm a wanted woman, I know ...


201     INT.  MINISTRY CORRIDORS - DAY

     Through a door marked "Information & Counter Espionage" --

     -- walks Steed with another man in identical clothes:  dapper Savile Row suit, umbrella
     and bowler.  Which is

     Emma Peel, in disguise.  Steed furtively checks passers-by.

                         STEED
               His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.

                         EMMA
               Why's he called 'Invisible'?

                         STEED
               You'll find out.

     At a door marked "Information -- Col. I. Jones." Steed knocks, opens the door for her.

                         EMMA
               Aren't you coming?

                         STEED
               I'll catch you up. Don't worry;
               he's expecting you.

     Emma goes in as Steed walks down the corridor.


202     INT.  MINISTRY OFFICE - DAY

     A room full of archives and files.  Emma walks through tall corridors, stacks of cabinets
     full of old paper.

     Dusty, musty and mildewing.  Long forgotten.  Nobody there.  Suddenly Emma 
     hears --

     FOOTSTEPS.

     She follows them.  Round stacks, round corners.  The FOOTSTEPS get LOUDER. 
     She's closing in.  The FOOTSTEPS get LOUDER, until up ahead of her --

     A filing cabinet drawer opens up.  On its own.

     Emma watches as a file pops up, floats through air.  The drawer slams shut.  Still
     nobody there.  Emma follows the file to a --

     Desk.  Emma watches as -- the chair swivels round.  The file pages open up.  Then the
     phone lifts up by itself, a voice:

                         INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
               Tell Miss Proudfoot, no calls.
                    (beat)
               Colonel Jones at your service,
               Mrs. Peel. Just a moment --

     Emma looks ahead of her.  To the chair. As --

     A desk drawer opens up, a pipe is whisked through the air, a match is struck.  The pipe
     lights; smoke belches forth.

                         INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
               Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel.
               That usually helps. Don't worry
               about me being invisible. Other
               than that I'm perfectly normal.

                         EMMA
               I see.

                         INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
               Or rather, you don't. Learnt the
               tricks in camouflage. Till this
               accident made a prang of things.
               How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?


203     INT.  MINISTRY - ANOTHER OFFICE

     Steed on the phone.

                         STEED
               I say, Trubshaw, Steed here ...
               Barometer's falling fast. Mrs.
               Peel and I find ourselves in
               need of foul weather gear.
                    (beat)
               Yes, I'd say gentlemen's snuff
               for starters. And then --


204     INT.  INVISIBLE JONES' OFFICE

     File pages flip through the air as Jones goes through them.

                         INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
               Ah, here we are. Steed asked me
               to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.

                         EMMA
               Peter's brother?  But --

                         INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
               Half-brother to be precise.

     Emma is surprised.

                         INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
               Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... 
               research into robotics and plastics.  
               Overtaken by Peter's work on the 
               physics of climate change ...

                         EMMA
               I know all this.

                         INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.) 
               Do you also know that during your 
               final experiment, your halfbrother-
               in-law was under surveillance?

                         EMMA
               Surveillance? By whom?

                         INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
               Father. She gave him an 'all clear' 
               after a security test by Dr. Darling.

                         EMMA
               Who's now vanished.

                         INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
               Makes two of us.

                         EMMA
               Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling 
               and Valentine were somehow in this 
               together? But that's absurd.

     Steed enters behind them on the run --

                         STEED
               We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...

                         EMMA
               Hurry?  What for?  I'm just
               now --

                         STEED
               You didn't tell her?

                         INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
                    (testy)
               I was getting to it.

                         EMMA
               Getting to what?

                         INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
               The World Council of Ministers meets 
               tomorrow to convene the new global 
               defense initiative --

                         EMMA
               I fail to see --

                         STEED
               There's a reception this evening. Colonel 
               Jones thinks it advisable we attend.

                         EMMA
               Have we been invited?

                         INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
                    (poker-voiced)
               Under the circumstances Mother didn't 
               see fit, but I think I can get you in ...

                         EMMA
                    (surveys her male
                    outfit)
               Well, I can't possibly go like this.

                         STEED
               I had a feeling. That's why we're 
               in a hurry ...

     Steed proffers an arm to Emma.

                         STEED
               May I have the honor, Mrs. Peel?

     She decides, takes his arm.

                         EMMA
               You may, Mr. Steed.

     The A-team is born.  Steed and Emma tip their hats to Jones.


205     EXT.  LONDON STREETS - SEVERAL ANGLES - NIGHT

     Troops rushing in to take up defense positions.  Searchlights pierce the cloudy sky.  A
     protective ring of hardware surrounds the hall.


206     INT.  MOTHER'S 22 BUS (AKA INSIDE MOBILE HQ) - NIGHT

     At the controls, Brenda looks on.  She hands a bag of jelly babies to Mother.  Who
     picks out his favorites, as he gives a briefing to Father and others, sitting in
     passenger seats --

     ORDERS BARKED OUTSIDE as --

                         MOTHER
               Inside that hall are some of the
               Most powerful figures in the
               world. Tight security. Our
               only option.

                         FATHER
               I'll see to it personally.

     Brenda glances over at Father's imperturbable face. As --


207     EXT.  PALACE (WESTMINSTER) - NIGHT

     Wind picking up.  Outside the grand palace hall for the reception of the World Council
     of Ministers, guards stand on duty.  Barriers, flashing lights.  Nobody gets past, 
     except --


208     INT.  PALACE (WESTMINSTER) - NIGHT

     Up in the gallery, Steed and Emma enter through a secret passage behind a painting. 
     He with bowler and umbrella.  She in black leather and boots.  They find themselves in
     a niche and freeze, very close to one another.  Steed sniff s ...

                         STEED
               What's that you're wearing?

                         EMMA
               It's called Black Leather.

                         STEED
               Intoxicating. Here, have one of
               these.

     He fumbles with a bulging jacket pocket

                         EMMA
               What is it?

                         STEED
               Limpet bomb. Small, very
               compact. From Trubshaw's.

                         EMMA
                    (hocks it on
                    belt)
               When all this is over, we simply
               must get you out of that suit.

                         STEED
               You first.

                         EMMA
               Shall we?

     She leads the way through marble halls, arched galleries, red velvet carpets, glittering
     chandeliers.  From the hall, a SPEECH ECHOES:

                         MINISTER (V.O.)
               ... In the uncertain climate that threatens 
               this global initiative, no magic umbrella 
               can shield us.

     Steed checks out his own.

                         MINISTER (V.O.)
               Only our own vigilance. Security and 
               stability are our watchwords.

     APPLAUSE.

     Steed pauses, offers Emma a small silver box.  Inside...

                         EMMA
               Trubshaw again? What now?

                         STEED
               Snuff.
                    (off Emma's lock)
               I must insist you try some.

     Steed takes some; Emma follows his example.  Weird.  Does it make you high?  They
     walk on, open doors to --


209     INT.  PALACE HALLWAY - NIGHT

     An empty gallery.  Steed and Emma peer down at a --


210     MARBLE HALLWAY

     A black and white floor.  Butlers move across like surreal chess pieces.  Otherwise,
     empty.  A chamber ensemble plays "The Merry Widow" waltz, which floats through
     empty halls.

                         STEED
               They're playing your song, Mrs.
               Peel.

                         EMMA
                    (annoyed)
               'The Merry Widow?' I might have
               known. Where's the reception?

     They move cautiously forward as


211     EXT.  LONDON STREETS - NIGHT

     Outside, snow begins to fall.  Trees and buildings shimmer under a light layer of white. 
     A Christmassy glow --

     Even troops play with snowflakes, until --


212     SEVERAL ANGLES

     The wind rises.  The snow falls harder.


213     INT.  PALACE - NIGHT

     Down in the hallway, Steed and Emma search for the Ministers.  They head down a 
     corridor, then hear a NOISE.  They hide behind pillers. As --

     Butlers walk past in military file, carrying elaborate displays of lobster and meats. 
     Steed steals --

     A chicken leg.  Nibbles on it.  Suddenly another door opens -- Emma hides.  Steed
     looks up to see -- Father "staring" at him.

                         STEED
               Oh, hello ...

                         FATHER
               We want Mrs. Peel.

                         STEED
               Dead, I'm afraid.

     Emma in hiding, listens as --

                         FATHER (O.S.)
               You disobeyed an order, Steed.  
               Mrs. Peel is dangerous; she cannot 
               be trusted.

     Emma looks out the window behind her; eyes widen ... back to --

                         STEED (O.S.)
               I think she can.
                    (beat)
               Can you?

     Emma is deeply affected by Steed's choice.

     Father's face, meantime, has turned to stone.

                         FATHER
               I shall summon security.

     She turns, almost walks into the door as she slips away.

     Emma returns as the ALARM is raised --

                         STEED
               Bad news. Father's looking for you.  
               Where are those bloody ministers?

                         EMMA
               Have a look at this.

     She leads him to the window:  sure enough -- heavy snow.
     Steed reacts, eyes wide.

                         STEED
               It's almost May, for heaven sake.


214     EXT.  LONDON STREETS - NIGHT

     The blizzard rages through streets --

     Now impassable.  Snow drifts block roads.  White mountains of snow start to climb up
     shop fronts.  And amid the sky --

     Filled with snowflakes, up round the roofs, a purple cloud descends on unsuspecting
     troops --


215     INT.  PALACE - NIGHT

     Steed returns, rushes across the marble halls --

     To Emma. But up ahead, sees --


216     STEED'S POV - FROM WINDOWS

     A purple fog seeping into the hallway, billowing through the corridors as --


217     INT.  PALACE ANTEROOM - NIGHT

     Inside an anteroom, like a Roman arena -- marble pillars, red carpet, golden walls,
     ceiling murals --

     The World Council ministers assemble:  slick pin-striped suits or African robes, Chinese
     Mao-suits, Indian Nehru-jackets, all distinguished men and women, surrounded by --

     Fussing officials, minor dignitaries, and butlers, bowing and weaving a web of
     diplomatic protocol, interrupted by --


218     CENTER OF HALL

     The sight of Emma Peel in black leather.

     She strides into the room.  Picks a glass of champagne from a passing butler.  All stare,
     Emma raises her glass --

                         EMMA
               Gentlemen, ladies. Forgive the breach 
               of protocol. An emergency --

     From the hallway -- BOOM -- !  The door bursts open, Emma is blown over by the
     blast as the purple cloud races inside.


219     SEVERAL ANGLES

     as the smoke furls around the ministers, they choke, fall.

     From the doors -- Steed leaps in, gives Emma another snort of snuff --

                         STEED
               Quick --it'll protect you --

     Emma inhales.  Now immune to the gas, Steed and Emma hear -- CRASH -- !  They
     see -- through thick cloud -a mysterious man in a white lab coat, wearing a gas mask,
     leading a group of butlers, all in gas masks -- heads like black flies -- in formation
     round the ministers, helpless on the floor.  A kidnapping --

     The man and butlers haul away several ministers, and --

     Escape from the rear doors.  The butlers form a guard to protect the man.

     Steed and Emma run after them.  More butlers pursue.


220     EXT.  PALACE - NIGHT

     As troops roll helplessly in the snow-covered purple haze, the butlers load the ministers
     onto waiting choppers as --


221     INT.  MOTHER'S HQ - CONTINUOUS ACTION     

     Mother, Brenda, et al choke on purple smoke in the bus ...


222     INT.  PALACE HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Behind pillars, Steed and Emma hide as --

     Butlers in gas masks patrol the halls.  A butler passes them without noticing.  They try
     to emerge.  But another patrols --

     Steed trips the butler with his umbrella, then chops him down on the ground.  He rises
     but Emma kicks him into as --

     Behind them Steed sees the lab-coated man escape up the stairs, protected by a posse
     of butlers.  He shouts --

                         STEED
               After him, Mrs. Peel!

     A whole posse of butlers then advances.  Steed faces them.

                         STEED
               Go -- !

     Emma hesitates.  Then turns, heads for an ornate dual shaft elevator.  She bangs the
     button, gets inside, doors shut, as the BULLETS from MACHINE-GUNNING gas
     masked butlers strike the brass door as --

     Steed whips his rapier from his umbrella and duels with the butlers.  To give Emma
     time, he uses every trick and prop at his disposal, plus, brute force to --

     Kick, chop, punch, and impale them into submission, as --


223     EXT.  ELEVATOR (UPPER FLOORS) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     The posse of butlers fan out on to keep pace with Emma.  They head upstairs, pressing
     elevator "CALL" buttons on every floor, as --


224     INSIDE ELEVATOR     

     Emma waits inside.  Until she reaches --


225     EXT.  ELEVATOR (2ND FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Doors open.  A HAIL of BULLETS hit the lift as Emma hides to one side until the
     doors close.


226     INT.  ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Emma sighs with relief.  COOL HUM as the ELEVATOR rises.


227     ON STAIRS - MEANWHILE

     Steed gaining on the butlers, heading for the stairs, as --

228     INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     At the next floor, the doors open --

     Two butlers rush inside.  BLAM -- !  Emma cuts one in the throat with an elbow
     punch,  then --

     Punches -- kicks -- stabs the other butler, a more brutish type, who recovers enough to
     grab Emma by the throat.

     She chokes, breaks his stranglehold, swerves him round, gains a nelson hold on his
     arms and throat --

     And a knee in his back in time for --

     PING!  The BELL RINGS at --

     3rd floor where --

     Emma spins her captive butler round, in time to face --

     Whooomph!  a blast of fire from --

     A flamethrower launched in the hall.

     Aaargh -- !  The butler gets fried, but --


229     EXT.  ELEVATOR (3RD FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Shields Emma from the worst of the blast. She  hurls him clear of the doors, which --


230     INT.  ELEVATORS - CONTINUOS ACTION

     Slam shut.  COOL HUM ...


231     EXT.  PALACE MAIN FLOOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Steed continues his one-sided duel with the other butlers, skewering madly, trying to
     get upstairs to help Emma...


232     INT.  ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Up Emma goes.  Looks for an escape route.  Bangs on the walls.  No trap doors.  No
     secret panels.  The "floor" light flickers between floors.

     Waiting, until ...


233     EXT.  ELEVATOR (4TH FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     The doors open.  A grenade is hurled inside the doors, it rolls to one corner, Emma
     dives to the other side, then --

     Scrambles for the grenade.  Picks it up.  It slips out of her hands.  Scrambles more.  It
     slips out ...

     Just beyond the elevator doors.  Which start to shut.  Emma leans out a foot, kicks the
     grenade towards the butlers, and --

     As her elevator doors close --

     BOOM -- !  It EXPLODES among the butlers, one of whom --

     Rushes to --


234     ELEVATOR (5TH FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Where he waits for the elevator.  Removes pin.  Grenade ready.  The light PINGS.
     Doors open.  About to throw it inside, when --


235     BUTLER'S POV

     No Emma.


236     BACK TO SCENE

     The butler hesitates.  Looks inside.  Still no Emma?  He wonders what to do, and --

     The doors shut; he jams his foot.  The doors open again.  He moves in --


237     INT.  ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     -- and looks round.  Nobody there.  Until, as we --

     PULL BACK UP to reveal -- FROM ABOVE, spread-eagled like an X on the elevator
     roof, limbs flexed against the walls is --

     Emma, who -- drops down and --

     Scissors the butler's head between her legs.

     The grenade rolls free ...

     Emma twists around, grabs his ears, and --

     Sits on his face.  Buries his head in her crotch.  A muffled sound from the guy, until --

     Emma scissor kicks, breaking his neck.  She drags --


238     EXT.  ELEVATOR (67H FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     His head out.  Leaving his neck between the doors.  So as she leaps out, heads up for
     the stairs, the elevators doors.

     SLAM! And -- BOOM!  His GRENADE rocks the elevator, which


239     INT.  ELEVATOR SHAFT - ABOVE AND BELOW - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Breaks from its ropes, and --

     Plummets down the elevator shaft, shaking the building as it crashes --


240     INT.  PALACE STAIRS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Everything shakes with the impact of the elevator as Steed battles his way up, step by
     step, throwing gas-masked butlers over his shoulder as he struggles...


241     INT.  PALACE ATTIC - NIGHT

     Up the winding staircase, at the top, a skylight, which --

     Flips open.  The man leaps out, throwing back inside a smoke grenade, and locks the
     skylight.  As the grenade --


242     INT.  NARROW STAIRCASE

     BOOM!  explodes in the narrow staircase, fills it with purple smoke.  Emma rushes
     thru smoke, choking.  She gets to the skylight, tries to open it -- locked.

     A moment's panic.  Then Emma -- punches a hole in the glass, flicks the switch, flips
     the skylight up, and --

     Emerges into the night air.  Snowflakes tumble around her.


243     EXT.  ROOFTOP - HELIPAD - NIGHT

     Blades whirling.  Amid the blizzard, the man ready to escape in a super-fab streamlined
     whirly chopper ...

     Another assassin attacks Emma, pins her on her back, overlooking the city.  Stands up
     before her --

     Emma held back over gargoyle, over now snow white city ...  Knees assassin in balls.
     Flicks him backwards ...

     As his body hurtles down into the snow-covered streets, Emma rushes forward.  
     But too late:  sees --

     The chopper -- about to take off.


244     FROM INSIDE CHOPPER

     The gas-masked MAN in the white lab coat:

                         MAN
               Goodbye, Mrs. Peel!


245     EXT.  ROOFTOP

     The chopper rises slowly.

     Emma looks.  A fifteen foot leap ... Impossible.


246     FROM INSIDE CHOPPER

     A farewell wave from the gas-masked man.


247     CLOSEUP - EMMA

     contemplating the jump, beneath falling snowflakes, as the distance grows.


248     EMMA'S POV

     The rope/chain ladder coils into the chopper's belly.


249     INT.  CHOPPER - NIGHT

     Above London rooftops, after dark --

     The man (still wears gas mask) the Pilot, CO-PILOT and a Butler (ditto).  From the
     chopper, a giddy look down thru a glass command module.  A fairy tale, snow white
     city.

     OVER the RADIO, interference.  A changing of stations.  Then a CRACKLY
     broadcast of "The Merry Widow."

     As the WALTZ serenades them high above the city  -- 
     a KNOCKING from outside on the door --

     Surprised reactions.  The Butler opens the door, sees --

     Emma hanging onto the helicopter struts.  The Butler is too dumbstruck to say
     anything.

                         EMMA
                    (shouts, re:  the
                    gas mask)
               Anyone ever tell you you look
               like a housefly?

     Emma grabs his epauletted shoulder, yanks him up, flicks him out --

     The Butler is jerked out -- flies into the open air.  Emma watches him fall ...

                         EMMA
               Anyone else need a lift?

     The white-coated Man moves forward, but Emma is out, slamming the door, still
     clinging ...

                         MAN
                    (to Pilot; intercom)
               Can't you throw her off?

     The Pilot nods, works controls, the chopper dips as --

     Blam -- !  a kinky leather boot crashes --

     Into the Pilot's face as Emma kicks in the GLASS from the front of the chopper,
     SMASHES so the Pilots can't see -- a sudden rush of cold air --

     The INSTRUMENT PANELS WHIRR round as the Pilots struggle for control --

                         VOICE (V.O.)
                    (intercom)
               Where'd she go?


250     EXT.  CHOPPER TOP - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

     with the blades whirling directly over her head, Emma crawls over the top of the
     chopper and lets herself down the other side as London's lights twinkle beneath ...

     As the Co-Pilot pokes his head out of the cockpit --

     Emma grabs him with one hand, hoists him up into the air --

     The Co-Pilot dangles over the city.  Grabs Emma.  Slithers back onto the cockpit.
     Pistol whips her.  Emma crunches back onto the metal.  Blades whirring close!  
     The co-Pilot peers into her eyes from inside the gas mask --

                         CO-PILOT
               Happy landings, Mrs. Peel.

     He raises his hand, ready to hit her again, Emma yanks him up, where his head get
     sliced off by the blades -- body and head fall away separately ...

     As Emma reacts, her legs are grabbed from below and the white-coated Man pulls her
     down the side of the chopper --

     Emma falls, but manages a flying handhold, hangs onto the chain wire below the
     chopper.  As --


251     EXT.  WIDE ANGLE - NIGHT

     The Pilot and his passenger zoom at low level over buildings.  Trying to dislodge
     Emma ...


252     THEIR POV

     Thru the blizzard, zooming down streets, landmark buildings looming up topped in
     snow, feet up ... shinnying up the chain wire ...

     "THE MERRY WIDOW WALTZ," no longer heard as old record or ensemble
     arrangement but enormous, for FULL ORCHESTRA ...


253     CLOSEUP - EMMA

     grimly hoists herself up along the struts again, hand over hand, coming up to the
     cockpit from behind --


254     BACK TO SCENE

     With a sudden movement, she yanks the Pilot out from behind and he goes flying
     towards eternity on his own.

     The chopper out of control as the white-coated Man is left to fly it himself ...


255     IN NIGHT AIR

     "THE MERRY WIDOW" BOOMS, the chopper lurches, spinning round -- up and
     down, over spiraling corkscrews, an insane waltz ...


256     INT.  CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

     The white-coated Man gets control ...


257     EXT.  CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

     Zig-zags down a narrow street, trying to smash Emma into sides of windows.


258     SEVERAL ANGLES

     as Emma bounces of buildings, holding on for dear life ...


259     EXT.  WIDE ANGLE OVER THAMES - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

     The chopper dips down, dragging Emma through icy water ...

     Up ahead ... Tower Bridge ... twin peaks ... a firework display going on ... rockets and
     lights in the sky thru snowflakes ...

     Emma sees the bridge coming, reaches down and --


260     CLOSEUP SHOT

     Detaches her pocket limpet bomb and lobs it into the chopper cockpit.


261     HER POV

     The bridge looms up, chopper rising to cross it as Emma leaps onto the bridge!


262     INT.  CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

     The Man sees the bomb ...

     Also flings himself onto the bridge as --

     Against b.g. of the fireworks display --


263     WIDE ANGLE - TOWER BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

     BOOM! -- the CHOPPER EXPLODES.  Ball of flames.  The crowd roars in
     appreciation ... great fireworks!


264     EXT.  TOP OF TOWER BRIDGE WALKWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

     Emma picks herself up, sees the Man in the white lab coat and runs for him.

     He runs too -- towards --


265     ANOTHER CHOPPER

     which unloads a rope ladder as Emma puts on every ounce of steam ... 
     The Man reaches for the dangling ladder --
     but --


266     CLOSEUP - ON HIS FOOT

     stuck, wedged between narrow battlements.


267     BACK TO SCENE

     The Man looks at his shoe, at Emma charging towards him, at the rope ladder.  He
     pulls his foot out of his shoe and grabs the ladder, sailing off in the second chopper,
     leaving Emma panting behind.  She's soaked, frozen, gasping for breath, bending over,
     when she sees --


268     CLOSEUP - SHOE

     Emma pulls it from its wedge, looks at the inside:  --  "Trubshaw's of Jermyn Street."

                         STEED (V.O.)
               I thought it was Cinderella
               who lost her slipper ...


269     INT.  TRUBSHAW'S - DAWN

     On Jermyn Street, snow lies waist high.  BLARING SIRENS.  Searchlights.  PA
     announcements urge citizens to stay indoors ... PULL BACK to reveal a fire glows, a
     CLOCK TICKS calmly.  Emma sits with her shoe, surrounded by a pile of shoes. 
     Steed & Trubshaw beside her.

                         EMMA
               This time the shoe's on the other
               foot. You said a hand-made shoe
               was as good as a photo-fit or
               D.N.A.? Well, all we have to do is
               find the shoe that fits ...

                         TRUBSHAW
               It should be easy. A Trubshaw
               client has his shoes delivered
               personally. The Ministry should
               be able to confirm our delivery.

                         STEED
               I'll be back ...

                         EMMA
               Where are you going?

                         STEED
               Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather 
               may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...

                         EMMA
               You needn't bother. I can't drag you 
               further into this. After all, I am still 
               the chief suspect.

                         STEED
               No bother. Mother and Father think
               I've joined you. I might as well.

                         EMMA
               But --

                         STEED
                    (comes back)
               Oh, and by the way, I think it's about 
               time you got rid of that chip on your 
               shoulder.

                         EMMA
               If you'd been through what I have,
               you wouldn't --

     Steed reaches and pulls off the micro-bug from her shoulder.

                         STEED
               A microtag. One of Mother's little
               toys. There you are. Free at last.

     He tips his bowler off her surprised reaction.


270     INT.  TRUBSHAW'S BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     An armory.  Steed stands before racks of umbrellas, displayed like ceremonial swords --
     ivory handles, duck handles, you name it ...

     Steed hefts a few, as picky as a Samurai ...


271     UPSTAIRS - HOURS LATER

     Emma surrounded by a mountain of shoes.  Triumphantly, she holds up a pair of shoe
     lasts.

                         EMMA
               Prince Charming, I presume.
               Your name is ...


272     CLOSE ON WORN PAPER LABEL

     with the name:  DARLING.

                         EMMA
               Oh my God ...

     Steed selects his umbrella and we FOLLOW UP TO:


274     INT.  TRUBSHAW'S - UPSTAIRS - DAY

     He sees only Trubshaw.

                         STEED
               Where's Mrs. Peel?

                         TRUBSHAW
               She just left, sir. In a hurry.

                         STEED
               What?

                         TRUBSHAW
               She said you'd understand.


275     ON STEED

     Worried.

                         VOICE (V.O.)
               Ah, here we are ...


276     CLOSEUP - PIP PUFFING IN MID-AIR

     WIDEN to reveal:


277     INT.  MINISTRY ARCHIVES - DAY

     Inside the archives, among leather volumes.  A file goes through the air, passed to
     Emma ... As she reads.  A map is opened across a desk from her.

                         INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
               'X' marks the spot. The shoes were 
               delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park.
               Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the 
               site of a former Ministry installation...

                         EMMA
               ... and now?


                         INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)

                         EMMA
               Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.

                         INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
               Very good, Mrs. Peel ...

                         EMMA
               I shall need a small plane.

                         INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
               You're not venturing alone, surely.

                         EMMA
               I'm going to find out who killed
               my husband. Will you take these
               documents to Steed?


                         INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
               Of course.


278     ON EMMA

               Tell him I said ... goodbye.


279     INT.  SECRET SERVICE HQ - DAY

     below the Thames as at the beginning.

     In darkest paranoia, Mother lies at the heart of his Labyrinth.  Controls around him
     flash emergency.  Panic.  Cakes piled up beside him, uneaten.  Beside him, Father.
     Brenda hands a phone.


                         BRENDA
               Steed for you.

     Mother grabs the phone, furious.

                         MOTHER
               Where's Mrs. Peel?

     He signals frantically for Father to trace the call, but being blind, Father just sits
there.

                         STEED (V.O.)
                    (filtered)
               I was hoping you could tell me.

                         MOTHER
               You're getting yourself into terrible 
               trouble, my son. Weather's turning 
               very nasty -- and so am I.

                         STEED (V.O.)
                    (filtered)
               I'm going to follow up on a hunch of 
               my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is 
               innocent and you have a mole.

                         MOTHER
                    (grabs mirror;
                    searches his face)
               Where?

                         STEED (V.O.)
                    (filtered)
               In your operation.

                         MOTHER
               I'm warning you for the last time, 
               Steed: whoever's behind all this, 
               looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like 
               Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.

     CLICK.  The line goes dead.


280     CLOSE ON MOTHER

     Furious.

                         MOTHER
               Steed??
                    (to Father)
               Find Mrs. Peel.

     Brenda smiles at the thought.  Father rises, grim.


281     EXT.  SKY - DAY

     Through mist, an ultralight plane zooms down -- From the plane, Emma leaps in
     parachute ...  Down, down, down through the mist ...

     Over parkland, the parachute floats down ... To an island in the middle of the
     Serpentine river.


282     EXT.  ISLAND (HYDE PARK) - DAY

     Emma lands, buries her parachute.  Walks towards a thick jungle, then a stream.  Emma
     hops across on water lilies until she reaches land again.  Where a peacock fans its tail of
     a thousand eyes.  A CLICK of CAMERAS.

     In the midst of the jungle, Emma sees --


283     HER POV

     A red phone box.  Emma frowns in recognition; goes inside.  Picks up the phone.
     Presses "Button B", and --

     The floor goes down.  Emma goes down with it, into --


284     INT.  HYDE PARK UNDERGROUND HQ

     Formerly a Ministry installation.  The "elevator" stops.  Remembering, as from a dream,
     Emma steps out into --


285     LONG DARK CORRIDOR

     A GUARD patrols.  Emma pushes herself against a wall.  The wall gives way to flip
     round, and Emma swivels into --


286     INT.  TOTALLY DARK CHAMBER

     The door locks behind.  Alone, Emma stands warily.

     From nowhere, a chilling, disembodied voice.  Intimate.  Seductive.

                         VOICE (V.O.)
               Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have 
               been a worthy opponent. You have 
               tracked us down. You are within an 
               ace of winning.

                         EMMA
               This isn't a game.

                         VOICE (V.O.)
               Quite right, but we still make the rules.

                         EMMA
               Rules are made to be broken.

                         VOICE (V.O.)
               People, too.

                         EMMA
               Then who wins?

                         VOICE
               You and I. Together. But first you 
               must confront your greatest enemy.
               Who could that be, Mrs. Peel?  
               The answer is obvious ...

     Suddenly lights!

     Emma is in a hall of mirrors.

                         VOICE (V.O.)
               Yourself.

     In every direction Emma turns, a thousand reflections of herself stare back at her,
     splintered into fragments as Emma spins, freaked and confused by the multiple images.

     Emma turns into herself -- only herself drapes arms around her and kisses her on the
     lips.

     Bad Emma -- whose eyes stare into Emma's startled ones as Emma pulls her mouth
     away, staggers back; realizes too late.  The hallucinogenic lip poison.  Emma crumples
     to her knees as --


287     EMMA'S POV

     Sees "herself" above her, before she -- falls unconscious.


288     EXT.  COUNTRY ROADS - DAY

     Steed's Jag races, skids in bad weather.


289     INT.  CAR

     Behind the wheel Steed, his face grim, concentrates on the slippery road.  On the seat
     next to him the snow shaker with little Emma inside --

                                             
          DISSOLVE TO:


290     INT.  UNDERGROUND H.Q.

     As if in a dream, Emma awakes captive inside a bizarre cage:  A life size snow shaker.
     Emma "swims" in viscous air,     suspended like a mermaid.  Thru glass she sees --

     A face peering in:  Father.

                         FATHER
                    (filtered)
               Emma in Wonderland. Welcome,
               Mrs. Peel.
                    (filtered)
               We've been expecting you. We hope 
               you'll enjoy your stay with us. 
               Decontamination is almost complete.

                         EMMA
               Decontamination -- ?

                         FATHER
               And you've a new wardrobe. He
               does want you to look attractive.
                    (beat )
               He tells me you're very beautiful.

     Emma pounds the glass in frustration.

                         FATHER
               Relax, Mrs. Peel. We're hundreds
               of feet below ground. The Ministry
               made it impregnable. No one can
               save you.


291     EXT.  SPIRES OF ETON COLLEGE - EVENING

     as Steed drives towards it ...


292     INT.  UNDERGROUND HQ - DINING ROOM

     Bathed in candlelight.  A romantic supper for two ...

     A door opens, admitting -- Emma. Dressed, coiffed, super-glamorous.  She locks
     around, sees another door.  In search of escape she hastens to open it, only to reveal --

     A giant rabbit -- the one we saw at the Teddy Bear meeting.

     Emma gasps in surprise, moves back into the room as he advances, removing the 
     head -- it's Dr. Darling!!!


                         DR. DARLING
               Emma, my dear. How lovely you
               look.

     He steps out of the rest of his costume ...

                         EMMA
               Would that I could say the Same.

                         DR. DARLING
               Ah, but you haven't see the real
               me. Watch closely ...

     He pulls at his face, which bubbles and collapses as he walks towards her --

     Emma's horrified expression, eyes widening as --

     Dr. Darling turns into ... Peter!

                         EMMA
               Peter ...

                         PETER
               Darling Emma --

                         EMMA
               It was you ... all the time?

                         PETER
               Not really. Not quite. I'm
               afraid you still don't see ...

     Again he claws at his face, pulling, twisting ...

     Emma winces at the sight, her eyes popping out of her head.

     It's Valentine!

                         TEACHER (V.O.)
               Valentine Peel ...


293     EXT.  ETON COLLEGE - EVENING

     beneath Gothic turrets pupils in top hats and tails.

               Yes, I remember him quite well ...

     PULL BACK THROUGH windows to reveal:  Steed and an OLD TEACHER in the
     beautiful library.

               This is where he used to spend his
               days. We have an old photograph
               somewhere ...

     He's flipping through yearbooks, then shows Steed --

     Emma frozen, sinks into a chair, staring ...

                         EMMA
               You.

                         VALENTINE
               Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true 
               genius behind the Prospero Project ...

     He walks around the dinner table as he talks ...

               But you died -- in the explosion ...


298     FLASHBACK - CLOSE ON HAND IN WHITE GLOVE

     Twisting the dial.  PAN UP the arm to reveal Valentine.

               Oh, no. I arranged the explosion.


299     BACK TO PRESENT

                         VALENTINE
               A slight miscalculation -- my face 
               was burned beyond recognition.
               Fortunately my research into plastics 
               came in handy ...

                         EMMA
                    (stunned)
               Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...

                    (stands)
               You killed my husband.

                         VALENTINE
               For starters. Of course I had to kill 
               the Teddy Bears, as well ...

                         EMMA
               Too many cooks --

               Spoil the majority shareholders. In

               But I found you. All the clues
               led me here ...

                         VALENTINE
               Of course. I planned that, too.

                         EMMA
               But -- why?

                         VALENTINE
               You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't
               you guess?
                    (moves toward her)
               For you. It was all for you ...

               I'm already married ...

               most attractive widow. Now I think 
               of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here.

               My latest model. A compound of 
               plastics and sensor chips. A big 
               improvement on the old X404s.
               The poor thing is quite fond of me. 
               Emma, say hello to Emma.

     BAD EMMA HISSES, a strange mix of STATIC and FEEDBACK.

                         VALENTINE 
               You know, I believe she's actually 
               jealous.

                         EMMA
               Valentine, listen to me ...

                         VALENTINE
               Right, bridesmaid. Now what
               have I left out? Oh, yes, I know:
               the ring.

                    (covers her hand)
               Ring?

     He stands very near her -- she's terrified -- then:

               How silly of me -- let me make

               Mother betrayed me. She was

     Emma's coffin, standing on end, like the Iron Maiden faces a wall of TV monitors as
     Valentine explains.

                         VALENTINE
               People expect weather to be free. 
               They're used to it. I call that a 
               denial of freedom. No freedom of 
               choice. An abuse of human rights. 
               They buy water, electricity, gas. 
               Why shouldn't they be able to buy 
               their own weather if they want to? 
               If they have a little incentive ...

     Emma reacts -- also Steed (unseen) behind her.

                         EMMA
               Such as?

                         VALENTINE
               Destruction of their local weather 
               systems. I can zap a thousand 
               Chernobyls into the air.

                         EMMA
               The result would be ...

                         VALENTINE
               Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop 
               failure.  Economic disaster.  
               Frostbite or sunburn ... on a 
               massive scale. 
               You've seen a few samples...

                         EMMA
               Then what's stopping you?

                         VALENTINE
               One very small thing. A diamond
               'cyclone' chip. A thousand times
               more information on a fraction of
               the size. If I possess that, my
               powers would be unlimited. My
               dear half-brother was developing
               it. But he suspected sabotage.
               He gave the chip to ... you,
               'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But
               also your ring.

     Valentine takes her by the hand. Kisses --


310     CLOSEUP - HER RING

A diamond.  In the light, a patterned imprint.  ZOOM IN -- a complex fractal equation of circuits.


311     BACK TO SCENE

                         VALENTINE
               The missing piece of the jigsaw.
               I tried to get you to give it to me 
               as Peter; I tried to steal it from 
               you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll 
               be a bit less subtle.
                    (he slips it off her
                    finger; holds it up)
               With this ring my plan will be
               complete.

                         EMMA
               How Wagnerian ... Do you mean 
               to say you've waited all these 
               years because you couldn't create 
               a chip on your own? That would 
               have amused Peter.

                         VALENTINE
               Speaking of Peter, there's more good 
               news: You won't even have to change 
               your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.

                         EMMA
               What are my choices?

                         VALENTINE
               Choices?

                         EMMA
               I'll never marry you.

     Valentine is philosophical.  He spins the sarcophagus on an axis, lying it flat -- Emma 
     lying in her coffin as he looks down at her --

                         VALENTINE
               One out of two isn't bad. I'll keep you 
               alive, darling Emma. In a year or five, 
               you may change your mind. If you're 
               still in it.

     Valentine presses a button.  From the ceiling -- a surgical laser.  Moves down to within
     inches of her face.

                         VALENTINE
               This little toy gave me back my face.
               It can replace yours. What do you think?
               Medusa? Madame Defarge? Maggie
               Thatcher?

     He marks an imaginary line round Emma's face.

     An ALARM BELL RINGS.  Emma reacts.

                         FATHER (V.O.)
               Dr. Darling, this is Father. We
               have an intruder. I repeat --

     Valentine switches off the PA.

                         VALENTINE
               Ah. That will be Steed. He followed 
               you. Please excuse me. I have work 
               to do. My most spectacular 
               performance. A ballet of clouds. It 
               was made for you. I want to give you 
               a heart, Emma. I want all of London 
               to see it. And now with this ...
                    (flourishes ring)
               They will.
                    (leans close)
               And for an encore: the biggest cyclone 
               in history will wipe the City from the 
               face of the earth.
                    (winks)
               Shape of things to come, my darling.

     He stuffs a gag into Emma's mouth and closes the coffin on her muffled protests. 
     Darkness.

     Immediately, Steed tries to force his way through the grille.  No such luck.

                         STEED
               Blast. What to do? Mrs. Peel!

     He doesn't dare say her name too loud -- and there's no telling if she could hear him in
     that thing, anyway.

     He turns around in the tunnel -- heads the other way.


312     EXT.  SKY OVER LONDON - NIGHT

     Moonlight night.  Dark clouds approach like an army, spreading shadows.


313     INSIDE CLOUDS

     MOISTURE SPITS and CRACKLES, static energy waiting to explode ...

     In the sky -- clouds join together like a genie from a lamp, forming -- over the city -- a
     strange dark sensuous figure, half human, half dreamlike.

     That stalks the city....


314     INT.  DUCTS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Steed crawling.  A rat runs over him ...

                         STEED
               The things I do for England ...

     Pitch dark, then --

     Emma's coffin is opened and we see Bad Emma, looking down.

     Bad Emma stares at her human double -- Emma: who looks imploringly at her to undo
     the gag.  Bad Emma removes it, she --

     Runs a finger down Emma's body, inside a hole torn in the leather -- warm human flesh.
     Blood.  Her flesh.  Her blood.  Fascinated.

                         EMMA
               You must let me go ...

     Bad Emma listens.  Gently lays her head on Emma's breast, listens to --
     the HEARTBEAT.  Ba-boom.  Ba-boom ...

                         EMMA
               Don't you understand? If he has
               me, he'll have no use for you ...
               he'll destroy you ...

     The words jolt Bad Emma back, remembering her mission.  She goes to the laser, aims
     it at Emma's face!

                         EMMA
               No...

     Bad Emma hesitates, looks strangely human as --


315     ANOTHER PART OF UNDERGROUND H.Q.

     The grille pops off and Steed emerges where the guards are waiting for him --

                         STEED
               Oh, dear.

     No escape.  He takes off his bowler -- deftly removes a strip from its brim, aims it at
     the guards, and --

     Hurls it ...


316     CLOSEUP - BOWLER (IN FLIGHT)

     A glinting razor's edge, which --

     Swoosh -- !  Slices into the closest guard before returning, like a boomerang to Steed.
     He taps twice hard steel as ...


317     OTHER GUARDS

     run towards him, Steed swivels gracefully and - slams the bowler in their faces, a
     sartorial knuckleduster -- wham -- !  One drops -- Bam -- !  The other collapses, slump
     to the ground.  Steed stoops down, picks up his hat, sees --

     A dent in its steel top.  For the first time, Steed loses his cool.  Genuine rage.

                         STEED
               Someone's going to pay for this.

     Stepping over the nearest body, Steed moves on his way, as --


318     CLOSEUP - VALENTINE

     places a ring inside a control module filled with identical-looking diamond chips ...

     WIDEN to reveal ...


319     INT.  CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

     Masses of dials and switches.  ( Off to one side, on a wall, a rack of rapiers ... )

     Valentine hits a switch ...

                         VALENTINE
               Start the countdown. Action
               stations. Five minutes ...

     The countdown starts, red digitals going backwards --

     Colorized computer screens map out hostile weather fronts.
     A COMPUTERIZED VOICE STARTS to COUNT.  The CLOCK TICKS.

     Father enters behind him.

                         FATHER
               Congratulations. The clouds are
               on course ...

                         VALENTINE
               To explode. London will be ashes.

                         FATHER
               Not yet! They haven't heard our
               terms ... !

     Father tries to hit the switch.  Valentine yanks her off.

                         VALENTINE
               Are you insane? Stop the program
               and you activate the auto-destruct!

                         FATHER
               But all those people -- !

     Valentine strikes her hard --

                         VALENTINE
               My cloud ballet! My cyclone!

     Father slides to the floor.  Valentine ignores her.  Concentrates on the control panel red
     lights, as --


320     EXT.  PARLIAMENT SQUARE - NIGHT

     Up in the sky, more white clouds --

     Darken into boiling black.  They move and billow.  Bubbling with gases and energy
     Swirling with motion, a life of their own.

     FROM river, a scarlet fog floats upwards.  It gains mass and weight, slowly forming as
     it rolls --


321     THROUGH CITY STREETS

     then RISES ABOVE them -- into a weird pulsating red shape.
     A love heart.


322     CLOSEUP - DIGITAL READOUTS

     Whirling backwards ...


323     INT.  MOTHER'S UNDERWATER HQ - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Mother at the controls.  RINGS the ALARM.  Panic stations as -- SIRENS BLARE. 
     WARNINGS RING OUT OVER TV and RADIO --

                         MOTHER
               Dense cloud formation moving south-
               west. On course for the center of the 
               city. A fog floating in from the river. 
               The prediction is ... unstable chemical 
               reaction. Enforce the curfew ... 
               Emergency stand by ... !


324     EXT.  SKY OVER BUCKINGHAM PALACE - NIGHT

     Bad storm clouds advance over London ... black and furious.


325     OVER CITY - SEVERAL ANGLES

     As shadows in a whirl of chemical matter.  An airborne CYCLONE of BELCHING
     static ELECTRICITY.  The black shape now --

     Forming a sensuous female shape.  Like a dream wisp of ...

     Emma Peel with an hourglass figure.  While --


326     FROM RIVER

     The heart-shaped cloud seems to -- move towards the black genie shape -- trying to
     connect, to form the cyclone ...


327     EXT.  LONDON STREETS - SEVERAL ANGLES - NIGHT

     Action stations.  AIR RAID SIRENS ...

     Like a re-run Blitz.  Streets now eerily empty and dark.
     Through deserted streets --

     Troops race to positions in gas masks.  Searchlights illuminate clouds.  Worried faces
     watch the skies, as --


328     CLOSEUP - DIGITAL NUMBERS

     Fly ...


329     INT.  HI-TECH TORTURE CHAMBER - DAY

     Chaos on all TV monitors as ...

     Valentine hastens down the spiral steps and opens Emma's coffin.  What will he find??
     Emma's there, still gagged.  Looks asleep.

                         VALENTINE
               My dear.
                    (pulls the gag:
                    kisses her)
               I wouldn't want you to miss the
               grand finale ...

     Emma opens her eyes.  Valentine looks down at her, until -- a tell-tale sign:  Z424. 
     Bad Emma is unmistakable.  He strikes her -- yanks her out of the coffin.

                         VALENTINE
               Find her. Kill her ...

     He races back upstairs as ...


330     INT.  UNDERGROUND HYDE PARK - HQ CATWALKS - CONTINUOUS
     ACTION

     Emma makes her way through the labyrinthine superstructure of the place, crawling
     high on a girder over some BURBLING LIQUID below.  She hears NOISE IN the
     DISTANCE.  Suddenly --


331     INT.  UNDERGROUND HQ - STEED - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Steed battles more guards!  No time to lose.

     Wham -- ! Bam -- ! Now moving with deadly earnest, Steed downs all oncomers,
     closing in on --


332     INT.  UNDERGROUND CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Steed rushes in, BOLTS the AIRLOCK behind.  Pounding on door.

     He sees the timer racing backwards -- stands over the controls, trying to figure out how
     to stop the program.

     Looks for the chip -- amongst all the rest it's like trying to find a contact lens in
water.


333     FLOOR-LEVEL HATCH

     opens behind.  Valentine emerges, drops the HATCH COVER with a THUD.  Steed
     whirls.

                         VALENTINE
               John Steed.

                         STEED
               Valentine Peel. I see you've gone 
               back to using your original face.

                         VALENTINE
               The last one you'll ever see.

                         STEED
               Perish the thought.

     Valentine fulls forth a rapier from the wall.

                         VALENTINE
               Did they tell you at Eton that I
               was fencing champion, too?

     Steed unsheathes his umbrella, revealing ditto.

                         STEED
               They said you were a very naughty 
               boy.

     The fight is on as the numbers grow smaller!


334     SEVERAL ANGLES

                         VALENTINE
               You're better than I expected.

                         STEED
               I was at Harrow ...

                         VALENTINE
               But did they teach you this?

     Valentine whacks the blade off Steed's umbrella handle.  Laughs.  A diminished phallic
     symbol.  Steed, dumbfounded.

     Valentine advances towards Steed --

     Who points the umbrella at him.

                         STEED
               Bang-bang ... you're dead.

                         VALENTINE
               You wish.

     He moves to close in, when ...


335     CLOSEUP - FLASH OF LIGHT

     from the muzzle, as a BULLET ZIPS out, and --


336     VALENTINE

     recoils.  Blood streams from his shoulder.  He looks up, devastated.  Steed blows
     smoke away from the muzzle.

                         STEED
               One shot -- for emergencies.

                         VALENTINE
                    (clutches wound)
               That's not playing by the rules.

                         STEED
                    (echoes Emma!)
               Rules are made to be broken.

                         VALENTINE
                    (pulls his own gun)
               If you say so.

                         STEED
               I do.

     He FIRES again.  To the heart.  Valentine spins to the floor.

                         VALENTINE
               You said ... one shot.

                         STEED
               Did I? My mistake.

     Steed turns to the console, tries to figure out how to stop the countdown, when behind
     the hatch opens again, revealing Emma.  Valentine pulls her up, grabs her as hostage --

                         VALENTINE
               I wouldn't do that, if I were you.

     Steed turns.

                         STEED
               Mrs. Peel -- !

     Valentine has Emma, a knife to her throat, stands over the hatch.

                         VALENTINE
               Bullet-proof waistcoats -- just the 
               thing. I get mine from Trubshaw's. 
               We'll be off now, won't we, darling?
                    (to Steed)
               We wouldn't want to miss the
               fireworks. Figure it out if you can, 
               Steed ...


337     DOWN HATCH

     Valentine drags Emma, bolting the hatch.


338     ON STEED

     He's torn briefly, but there are thousands of lives at stake; Steed goes to the control
     module and starts pulling out chips, looking ...


339     EXT.  LONDON - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

     The biggest cyclone you've ever seen starts slowly whirling above the city, gathering
     momentum ...


340     NUMBERS

     Valentine drags Emma backwards ...

     The cyclone picking up force ...

     pull up a chip.  The red numbers freeze.  WIDEN to reveal...


344     INT.  CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     The SIRENS CEASE.  Steed allows himself a smile of relief.


345     EXT.  LONDON - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

     The giant cyclone begins to break apart ...


346     SEVERAL ANGLES - DYING STORM


347     CLOSEUP - RELIEVED FACES

     Troops pulling off gas masks as ...


348     INT.  CONTROL ROOM - ON SCREENS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Steed sees the breakup of the cyclone ...

     Then -- behind him -- an ominous CLICK-CLICKING as the PROGRAM reconfigures.
     A DIFFERENT ALARM BUZZER SOUNDS and the words: 

     "AUTO-DESTRUCT, 3 MINUTES"

     start flashing ...

     A different set of numbers start running backwards ...

                         STEED
               You must be joking ...

349     EXT.  CATWALKS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Valentine, dragging Emma, reacts to the new ALARMS.

                         VALENTINE
               Fool ...

     In his hesitation, Emma suddenly makes her move.  A struggle -- Emma takes a bad fall
     down a landing below.  Ugly THUD.  Dead.

                         STEED
               That will do.

     He's materialized across the girder from Valentine.  Who pulls his revolver.

                         VALENTINE
               Aren't you forgetting about
               something?

                         STEED
               You are, and it's behind you.

                         VALENTINE
               Come, come. You don't really
               expect me to fall for --

     Bad Emma's arms go 'round Valentine in a lethal embrace.

                         VALENTINE
               Let go, you ... idiot ...

     Uh uh.  She holds him in a vice-like grip.  Hugging Valentine.

                         STEED
               I think she really likes you ...
               Where's Mrs. Peel?

                         VALENTINE
               Ugh ...

     As the life is squeezed out of him, Bad Emma finally smiles.  Cradled together, she
     chokes Valentine, who gasps for breath, as --

     One last desperate move on his part and Bad Emma tumbles backwards, Valentine
     locked in her arms in a dying embrace.

     They fall into the mists and liquid below.

     Steed almost falls himself as he grabs a beam for support.  Looks down, sees ...


350     EMMA

     Dead.

                         STEED
               Emma!

     He has said her name.  He scrambles down to her body.

     Emma lying sprawled out on the ground.

     Steed picks up her limp body in his arms like "Sleeping Beauty."  His eyes fill with
     tears.  He lays her down.

                         STEED
               Emma ...

     He produces Peter's ring.


351     CLOSEUP - RING

     Slips it onto her finger and ...


352     BACK TO SCENE

     Kisses her.  A chaste kiss on the lips.  But with the force and passion of a lover.  He
     closes his eyes, looks away in grief.  The ALARM STILL SOUNDS but Steed doesn't
     give a damn.

     Behind, Emma opens her eyes.  As if revived by the kiss.  Or the ring.  Looks up at
     him.

                         EMMA
               Steed?

     Steed looks back at her -- surprise, delight.

                         STEED
               Mrs. Peel?

                         EMMA
               What kept you?

                         STEED
               The plot.
                    (realizing)
               Hello, we must be going ...


353     CLOSEUP - AUTO-DESTRUCT NUMBERS

     Racing backwards as ...


354     SEVERAL ANGLES

     Steed pulls Emma through the catwalks and corridors of Valentine's Labyrinth ...


355     MORE NUMBERS

     racing to zero, nothing to stop them ...


356     INT.  TORTURE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Steed and Emma race in -- she sees the sarcophagus.

                         EMMA
               Quick!

     Emma scrambles in and Steed leaps on top of her, bringing down the lid as ...


357     SEVERAL ANGLES

     3-2-1 -- and a BLAST like a nuclear EXPLOSION -- as the Underground HQ is
     fragmented to smithereens -- Emma's " coffin" goes flying ... as the SCREEN WHITES
     OUT.


358     EXT.  ALBERT BRIDGE - NIGHT

          Beneath the clear moonlight, all bulbs on -- like Xmas.


359     BELOW

     it floats the coffin -- which opens, revealing ...

     Steed and Emma, squashed together, gasping for breath.

                         STEED
               'The owl and the pussycat went
               to sea -'

                         EMMA
               '... in a beautiful pea green boat...'

                         STEED
               A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...

                         EMMA
               Still a bit chilly ...

                         STEED
               English weather. You know, after 
               all we've been through, I should 
               say we deserve a long holiday ...

                         EMMA
               Have you any place in mind?

                         STEED
               As a matter of fact I have ...

     The coffin drifts downstream in the moonlight.

                                             
     SLOW DISSOLVE TO:


360     EXT.  SIBERIAN ICE FIELDS - DAY                    360

     A few weeks later.  Across snowy wastes, a pack of Huskies drag a sled behind them,
     WHIP CRACKED by a --

     Frozen fur-clad Siberian peasant.  As he turns a corner, dogs stumble from ice and
     snow into --


361     SAND

     The peasant stops, stares.


362     AHEAD OF HIM

     Sun beats down.  A tropical beach.  A warm sea.  A butler, Trubshaw.  POPS a
     CHAMPAGNE CORK.  From a tent, he brings two glasses down the beach to


363     TWO DIVAN-STYLE DECK CHAIRS

     Where Steed and Emma toast in the sun.  Steed in a smoking jacket, Emma in a bikini.

                         EMMA
               I don't recall Siberia being this
               warm, Steed.

                         STEED
               It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.

                         EMMA
               Our little paradise -- just made
               for two?

                         STEED
                    (looks; frowns)
               Not quite.

     On cue from the water, Mother emerges, snorkeling in his wheelchair contraption --
     with Brenda.  He waves to --

                         STEED
               Our chaperon.

                         EMMA
               Pity your mother came, too ...

     Steed seems peeved that his chance to be alone with EMMA is spoiled.  Trubshaw
     pours glasses of champagne.

                         STEED
               Still a little warm, Trubshaw.
               Is this the '28? A little more
               ice, I think ...

     Trubshaw trots off dutifully.  A large ice bucket appears.  Mother moves in.  Absorbed
     by Emma, now his new protegee.

                         MOTHER
               About your next assignment, Mrs.
               Peel ...

                         EMMA
               Next assignment?

     Steed gives his champagne to the Siberian peasant.  He presses a switch -- an umbrella
     shoots up between them, opens up, twirls.

     PULL BACK to reveal the strip of beach, like a tiny bubble of tropical weather. 
     Against a Siberian b.g. of snow.  As we WIDEN we REVEAL a giant glass bubble,
     hearing --

                         EMMA (V.O.)
               Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops
               nearby?

                         STEED (V.O.)
               Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll
               send Mother ...

     PULL BACK to reveal no shop for miles around.

                         MOTHER (V.O.)
               Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps
               another macaroon ...

                         EMMA (V.O.)
               Thank you, Steed.

                         STEED (V.O.)
               Thank you, Mrs. Peel.

     Behind the umbrella -- LAUGHTER.  CHINK of GLASSES.

                                             
               FADE OUT.




                         THE END
