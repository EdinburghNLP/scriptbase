     FADE IN:

     ROLL CREDITS OVER:

     EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAWN

     VARIOUS EXTRA CLOSE-UPS of this luxurious patchwork of 
     brilliant greens:

     A POLISHED BRASS SPRINKLER HEAD

     pops up from the ground and begins to water the already dew-
     soaked lawn.

     FLEET OF DUCKLINGS

     No mother in sight, cruise through the thrushes.

     GRAVEYARD OF GOLF BALLS, UNDERWATER

     At the bottom of a water hazard.

     PALM FRONDS

     After a neat they sway, revealing the barren desert that 
     surrounds the artificial oasis. The sun already bakes the 
     air. We hear the opening guitar strains of the Kim Deal-Kurt 
     Cobain suet of "WHAT I DID FOR LOVE," as we CRANE DOWN the 
     palms to

     A BRAND-NEW TITLEIST 3 BALL.

     Just on the edge of the rough. A pair of yellow trousers 
     moves in. An iron confidently addresses the ball, and chips 
     it out. The trousers walk out after it.

     HANDS

     Digging dirt out of the grooves of the iron's face with a 
     golf tee, while on the way to the green. Both hands are 
     gloved, instead of one, and the gloves are black.

     YELLOW TROUSERS

     In a squat over the ball, sizing up the curvy, fifty-foot 
     journey to the hole. The figure positions himself and the 
     putter above the ball, then pops the ball lightly. The ball 
     rolls and bobs with purpose toward the hole, dodging hazards 
     and finding lanes, until it finally falls off of the green 
     and into the hole.

     THE GLOVED HAND

     Sets the ball on the next tee. The figure moves to a leather 
     golf bag. The hands pull the wipe rag off of the top of the 
     bag and drop it on the ground, reach into the bag, drawing 
     out a compact SNIPER RIFLE, affixed with a long silencer. 
     The figure drops one knee down onto the rag, the other foot 
     firmly setting its spikes. We move the figure to see the 
     face of the sniper, concentrating down the scope in his half-
     squat. He is MARTIN BLANK.

     We SWING AROUND behind his head to look down the barrel with 
     him. Four-hundred yards away, on another part of the course, 
     another green is barely visible through groves of trees and 
     rough. Three miniscule, SILVER-HAIRED FIGURES come into view. 
     One of them, in a RED SWEATER sets up for first putt. He 
     could be an investment banker, or an arms trader.

     MARTIN'S ARM

     Flinches, and a low THUNK reports from the rifle. A second 
     later in the distance, the

     RED SWEATER'S HEAD

     Seems to vanish from his shoulders into a crimson mist. His 
     body crumples to the green.

     MARTIN

     Returns the rifle to the bag, pulls out a driver, moves to 
     the tee and whacks the ball. He watches its path and whispers 
     absently...

                      MARTIN
          Hooked it. 

     INT. CLUB HOUSE PATIO - LATER

     The outdoor post-golf luncheon area of an elite Texas golf 
     club. Martin sits in on the fringes of a conversation between 
     a group of executive types. CLUB MEMBER #1 has a Buddha-like 
     peace in his eyes through the philosophical talk.

                      CLUB MEMBER #1
          I'd come to the realization that 
          everything I'd based my life on was 
          false. And that my life had no 
          meaning.

                      CLUB MEMBER #2
               (to Martin)
          He gets this way when he hits over 
          eighty-five.

                      CLUB MEMBER #1
          It seemed like my life was slipping 
          away, somehow. I was a knot in the 
          middle of a wet rope. Everything was 
          futile and nothing had value.

                      CLUB MEMBER #3
          That's the way life is. The only 
          meaning and value is what we create. 
          Through structure, and discipline. 
          Though they seem to limit our freedom, 
          they actually give us great comfort. 
          Your problem is you're looking for 
          some great answer. Some ultimate 
          truth. When what you really should 
          do is go to work and go home.

                      CLUB MEMBER #2
          And take golf lessons.

                      CLUB MEMBER #1
          That's a tragedy. Can I finish my 
          story please? I began my search for 
          meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, 
          Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I 
          went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, 
          herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, 
          and a psychic. And they all pretty 
          much say the same stuff.

                      CLUB MEMBER #2
          A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are 
          telling you the same thing? You're 
          insane.

                      CLUB MEMBER #1
          Basically the same thing. In a very 
          evolved, esoteric way.

                      CLUB MEMBER #2
          Insane.

                      CLUB MEMBER #1
          To make a long story short...

                      CLUB MEMBER #3
          --Thank God--

                      CLUB MEMBER #1
          ...at last I found the holistic system 
          of systems that opened up the doors 
          of heaven for me right here on earth. 
          And everyday I see the world through 
          the eyes of a child. A world of 
          creation and wonder.

                      CLUB MEMBER #2
          Jesus...

                      CLUB MEMBER #1
          Overflowing with love.

                      MARTIN
          Tell me about it.

     Club Member #1 turns to Martin.

                      CLUB MEMBER #1
          P.P.P. Personal Pan Power. All the 
          secrets of your universe are divided 
          up into eight easily digestible 
          slices.

     Club Member #1 pulls a laminated card from his wallet and 
     hands it over to Martin. In the distance, sirens begin to 
     wail.

                      CLUB MEMBER #1
          See, see. It's in the accessible and 
          everyday shape of a pan pizza. Each 
          day you have a little slice of 
          peace...

     INSERT - WALLET-SIZE P.P.P. CARD

     A pizza-shaped diagram showing six "sections".

                      MARTIN
          Oh I see. You got your individual 
          slices of hope, dignity, confidence, 
          self-love, justice, and harmony.

                      CLUB MEMBER #1
          You open 'em up and there's the 
          sayings, stories, little bites of 
          insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day 
          Week.

                      MARTIN
          So you eat-- read it everyday?

                      CLUB MEMBER #1
          Yes.

                      MARTIN
          And these pan pizzas have opened up 
          the doors to heaven?

                      CLUB MEMBER #1
          Correct.
               (re: the card)
          That's for you. Keep it.

     Sirens are getting louder, closer to the club.

     EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - DAY

     The source of the sirens are almost upon us. Martin walks 
     toward his rented Town Car as the VALET pulls it up. He meets 
     the Valet by the trunk, where he trades tip for keys.

                      MARTIN AT CAR
          He fishes out the laminated "Personal 
          Pan Power" card, looks at it, and 
          tosses it onto the ground. Police 
          cars, now visible in the distance, 
          wind into the long club driveway. 
          Martin gets into his car and pulls 
          away.

     LAMINATED CARD

     As it lays on the asphalt. The wheel of a police car rolls 
     to a stop on it.

     INT. AIRLINER - DAY

     Martin sits in a first class seat, the tray table flipped 
     down. On the left side of the tray is a stack of magazines 
     of all kinds - Sports Illustrated, Mademoiselle, Wired, 
     Rolling Stone, National Review, Spin, National Geographic, 
     and on. He draws one off the top, and flips through it, 
     impassively taking in images and reading nothing. When he is 
     done with one, he discards it into the empty seat next to 
     him and draws another-- Martin's way of instantly and 
     massively uploading the world around him:

     Toothless hockey player in triumph, Sony product parade, 
     crouched starving child with vulture in the background, 
     supermodel in suede, Tic Tacs, living former Presidents, arm 
     in arm, smiling, etc.

     INT. HIRED CAR, NEW YORK - DAY

     The livery weaves out of the arrival lanes at Kennedy airport. 
     Martin reclines in the back seat, a conversation having 
     already begun.

                      DRIVER
          How was your day, today, sir?

                      MARTIN
          Effective. But to tell you the truth, 
          I've lost my passion for work.

                      DRIVER
          Do you like the people you work with?

                      MARTIN
          I work alone.

                      DRIVER
          That's it then. That's it. I've always 
          been alone. That's why I'm a good 
          driver. I can handle it. See, I can 
          think on my feet. I survive, I'm a 
          thinker. And I can sit there in front 
          of your house for two hours and it 
          don't bother me. Some people can't 
          do it! Some people are ranting and 
          raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to 
          get out here and get in this car, I 
          can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna 
          go? You're gonna wind up back in 
          your garage at seven o'clock at night. 
          You ain't going nowhere. You leave 
          your house in the morning you get 
          back to your house in the evening. 
          What's the big deal, right?

                      MARTIN
          You understand the psychology of the 
          job.

                      DRIVER
          I do. Some guys can't adjust to it; 
          they can't handle it.

     INT. CAR - MANHATTAN STREETS - LATER

     The car cuts through the upper east side. Martin and the 
     Driver exchange looks through the rear-view mirror.

                      DRIVER
          You look like you're far away. Far 
          away and thinking about other things. 
          I'm right about that, aren't I?

                      MARTIN
          No.

                      DRIVER
          Well, let's just say that sometimes 
          I'm right. Sometimes you are.

                      MARTIN
          Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only 
          natural.

                      DRIVER
               (laughs to himself at 
               this great truth)
          It's only natural....

     The Driver pauses for dramatic emphasis

                      DRIVER
          I been looking at you, and I've 
          decided that I want to share something 
          with you.

                      MARTIN
          Okay.

                      DRIVER
          Because your problem is you're bored. 
          And you have a very big mind.
               (beat)
          I am part of what I call a brain 
          syndicate.

     No reaction from Martin.

                      DRIVER
          I am part of a network of minds, a 
          group of five people who are all 
          connected, over hundreds, even 
          thousands of miles, through the mind. 
          We can think with each other, think 
          for each other. I can be driving 
          somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- 
          whatever it is-- and at the same 
          time be thinking a thought in someone 
          else's mind, far away. Running someone 
          else's brain.

                      MARTIN
               (indicates)
          Up on the right.

                      DRIVER
          And when you think of it, it's not 
          so surprising that a small group of 
          people control the whole world, is 
          it?

     INT. HOTEL ROOM, NEW YORK CITY - DAY

     A sedate and well-appointed four-star suite on the Upper 
     East Side. Martin stands in front of one of the open windows 
     watching the canopied entrance of an elegant high-rise across 
     the street. He lifts an eye rinse cup to his eye and tilts 
     it back. A cellular phone RINGS, interrupting him. He moves 
     to the desk and draws one of three phones from his briefcase, 
     depresses a scrambler module, flips it open, and listens for 
     a moment.

                      MARTIN
          If it's not there, I can't proceed. 
          Tell them.

     Martin hangs up. Picks up another phone and dials. As he 
     waits for an answer, he goes to a Fed Ex blueprint tube lying 
     on the bed.

                      MARTIN
          Tom. I've been waiting for an answer. 
          I'm only in town tonight.

     He breaks the shipping seal and pulls out a series of finished 
     metal parts including a long thin barrel, a scope, and a 
     silencer.

                      MARTIN
          What's different this time than the 
          last time? I have to be down front...

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME

     Martin stands in front of the window, phone in one hand, the 
     scope in the other. Next to him, the assembled rifle rests 
     across the arm of a chair.

                      MARTIN
          ...I don't bother to call anyone 
          else because you always take care of 
          me.

     He glances over to a second window to his left, which offers 
     a view further down the street. He goes to it. He raises the 
     scope and sees

     MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE- WINDOW #2

     A few blocks down, small even through the high-powered scope, 
     is your average BICYCLE MESSENGER dressed in lycra racing 
     gear, weaving through traffic toward us. Slung low across 
     his right hip is a black canvas bag. The Messenger's hand is 
     hidden in it. The other phone begins to RING.

                      MARTIN
          Hold on a second, Tom. I got my hands 
          full here.

     He sets down the phone and answers the other, still watching 
     the messenger.

                      MARTIN
          Good. Account number 3649367, transfer 
          to account number 96-546-38739-47825. 
          Ask for Mr. Sanchez, tell him it's 
          Mr. Duckman. If there are any 
          problems, access file 673594638-IO-
          98, and look at it.

     Martin drops the phone and moves away from Window #2 to the 
     rifle. He mounts the scope and he looks out Window #1 at the 
     high-rise.

     MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE - WINDOW #1

     Of a DOORMAN opening the door for a group of five men in 
     suits. Four BODYGUARDS form a perimeter around the fifth 
     man, a mall, avuncular figure in his forties dressed in 
     Saville Row finery.

     MARTIN

     Takes a step back into the shadows of the room, and raises 
     the rifle toward Window #2.

     MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE - WINDOW #2

     of an empty street. The bicycle messenger flashes past.

     MARTIN

     concentrating, tracks the path of the Messenger, leading him 
     left to right across the blind spot of the hotel room wall 
     between Window #2 and Window #1.

     STREET

     the bicycle Messenger bears down on the group of men, drawing 
     a Mac-10 submachine gun from his bag. The group see him-- 
     just as Martin's sniper FIRE explodes the Messenger's chest. 
     Two of the Bodyguards collapse onto their boss. The other 
     two open fire on the Messenger as he wipes out horribly into 
     a parked car in front of them.

     MARTIN

     withdraws from the window, and picks up the phone again and 
     begins to break down the rifle.

                      MARTIN
          Sorry Tom. But look, I know it's the 
          playoffs. That's why I'm offering a 
          thousand dollars for one seat...

     Martin listens patiently as he works.

     EXT. STREET - SAME - INTERCUT

     DOORMAN'S HANDS

     unbuttoning his double-breasted long coat.

     MARTIN

     just finishes packing.

                      MARTIN
          ...Well let me ask you, Tom. What do 
          I have to do to get courtside tickets 
          for the Knicks...?

     STREET

     The two bodyguards kick at the Messenger's body. The other 
     two begin to move off of their boss, who rises cowering. The 
     Doorman stands behind it all, unbuttoning his coat.

     DOORMAN

     a tall, dark, sharp-featured man in his forties, wearing a 
     handlebar moustache. He moves toward the group of men as he 
     flips open his coat back over two huge chrome .44 Magnum 
     Charthouse Bulldog revolvers and OPENS FIRE on them.

     MARTIN

     is closing his bag when he hears the gun-thunder.

                      MARTIN
          Never mind. I gotta go.

     Martin drops the phone, grabs his scope, and spins to the 
     window.

     MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE

     of the Doorman kicking through the pile of dead bodyguards. 
     He gets to the man at the bottom-- their boss. The Doorman 
     FIRES both guns.

     MARTIN

     reacts, surprised to see a second shooter. He pulls himself 
     from the window, puts away his scope, and accelerates his 
     exit.

     HIGH-RISE FOYER

     Outside, we see the doorman drop both guns on the pile of 
     bodies. He walks back toward us through the glass doors and 
     makes his way through the building toward the service exit. 
     He sheds his uniform and stuffs it into a plastic bag.

     MARTIN

     his two parcels in hand, exits out the side door of the hotel 
     and walks down the street.

     DOORMAN

     now wearing rich man's sweats, hops off the loading dock, 
     walks to a Lincoln Town Car, and drives off.

     INT. MARTIN'S AND GROCERS CARS - DAY

     Martin rolls down FDR Drive in a Lincoln Town Car once again 
     on the cellular.

                      MARTIN
          ...Tell them that's not my problem. 
          I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- 
          not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.

                      MARCELLA
          Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.

                      MARTIN
          Patch him through....

     Martin notices another Town Car appears in the next lane. We 
     recognize the Doorman behind the wheel, phone in hand. He is 
     GROCER.

                      MARTIN
          What do you want?

                      GROCER
          I'm setting up a concern that would 
          enable those of us in our rarefied 
          profession to consolidate our efforts.

                      MARTIN
          Like a union?

                      GROCER
          Like a club. Work less, make more.

                      MARTIN
          Thank you, no.

                      GROCER
          We could be working together, making 
          big money, killing important people... 
          I'm willing to let you in on the 
          ground floor.

                      MARTIN
          And you could be... sort of like... 
          a father figure to me....

     Grocer ignores this.

                      GROCER
          It's a free-market evolution. You'll 
          wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used 
          to run together when you were a 
          rookie. I don't want to run against 
          you. This thing's real. Everybody's 
          in.

                      MARTIN
          Not me. So don't paw at me with your 
          dirty little guild.

                      GROCER
          I'm gonna get you, kid.

     Martin hangs up and pulls away.

     INT. AIRLINER - DAY

     Martin sits in first class, wiping his face and hands with 
     an airline hot towel. He folds the wet cloth and once again 
     speeds through the images from a thick stack of magazines. 
     He looks up as he hears PILOT V.O.  It's seventy-six degrees 
     and partly cloudy in Chicago this afternoon...

     INT. APARTMENT, CHICAGO - NIGHT

     Martin walks into a sparsely furnished apartment. He wearily 
     drops his carry-on bag and briefcase in the hall.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

     Martin sits on a futon couch watching MTV with no sound. On 
     the coffee table in front of him is a phalanx of vitamin 
     bottles. Martin takes some capsules from each and washes 
     them down with a reddish-orange beverage.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

     Martin lies on his back on the hardwood floor. His eyes are 
     closed and he wears a set of headphones as he absently taps 
     his chest.

                      WOMAN (V.O.)
          "Dear Alumni: Can you believe it's 
          been ten years? Where are you now...?

     After a moment, his eyes open, alerted. His head turns to 
     the side, and his hands lightly cup the headphones.

     CLOSE-UP: WIRE

     from the headphones as it winds to a small metal box, with 
     one unmarked switch and one amber light- definitely not a 
     walkman. The wire continues out of the other side of the 
     box, across the floor, connecting to a suction cup stuck to 
     the floor.

                      WOMAN (V.O.)
          ...Are you guiding an Outward Bound 
          canoe trip like Brook Stinson? Or 
          perhaps in charge of appearances for 
          the NFL like Leslie Gunther....?

     MARTIN - A MINUTE LATER

     draws a pre-cut section of the floor, the width of a pencil 
     and twice as long, by a string.

     VIDEO MONITOR - A MINUTE LATER

     The greenish Starlight (night vision) image of a young, HUSKY 
     MAN sleeping on his back, as seen from above. A fine thread 
     snakes from behind CAMERA to just above the man's slack mouth. 
     We PULL BACK to reveal a Sony Watchman that holds the IMAGE. 
     KEEP PULLING to reveal Martin watching it as he maneuvers 
     the thread down past the fiber-optic cable through the hole 
     in the floor.

     MARTIN - A MINUTE LATER

     concentrates as he applies three drops of blue liquid on the 
     thread. As the drops run down along the thread through the 
     floor, his attention shifts to the

     VIDEO MONITOR

     The drops, huge in the foreground, become smaller as they 
     make their way down the line toward the sleeping man.

                      WOMAN (V.O.)
          ...Could it be that you're like Chip 
          Longfellow, at the trade-relations 
          tank in Washington. Sandy Glasser 
          owns a cheese shop...!

     MARTIN

     adjusts the thread minutely with one hand, and lowers the 
     fiber-optic cable with the other.

     VIDEO MONITOR

     The face begins to fill the screen as the fiber-optic follows 
     the drops toward it. Suddenly, the man snorts and turns his 
     face...

     A DROP FALLS

     It misses the man's mouth and hit's his cheek.

     VIDEO MONITOR

     The man's eyes snap open in terror as he looks directly into 
     CAMERA. His image falls away as the fiber-optic is jerked 
     back up through the hole in the floor.

                      WOMAN (V.O.)
          ...Looking at yearbooks and pictures 
          evokes so many memories...!

                      MARTIN (V.O.)
               (hushed)
          Fuck!

     MARTIN

     stuffs the apparati into an open duffel bag, and flies out 
     of frame.

                      WOMAN (V.O.)
          ...Some good. Some bad. But all 
          interesting...

     INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

     A BODYGUARD sits outside an apartment door. A muffled but 
     dire scream is heard from within and he is on his feet, gun 
     in hand. An exit door in the hallway slams open revealing 
     Martin, his gun already pointed at the Bodyguard. The 
     Bodyguard levels his at Martin.

                      MARTIN
          Freeze! Police!

     The Bodyguard hesitates just long enough to get double-tapped 
     through the head.

                      WOMAN (V.O.)
          ...As a graduate of the class of 
          1984, you are someone special...

     Martin moves to the dead Bodyguard, and locates a retractable 
     key chain on his belt. He unreels the ring of keys and opens 
     the door. He lets the keys retract back to the belt and drags 
     him into the apartment.

     INT. HUSKY MAN'S APARTMENT - SECONDS LATER

     Martin moves silently down the hall in a crouch. He comes to 
     the bedroom and slips across the threshold.

                      WOMAN (V.O.)
          ...Whenever news of you filters back, 
          the school is excited and proud of 
          your accomplishments...

     INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

     Martin crouches down outside the bedroom door. He points the 
     gun at the door, and reaching up turns the knob. As the door 
     opens, the Husky Man FIRES wildly over Martin's head. Martin 
     returns with one shot to the hut which sits the man down on 
     the floor.

                      WOMAN (V.O.)
          ...We hope Grosse Pointe High prepared 
          you well to lead the kind of life 
          that makes an impact on the world...

     Martin kicks the gun away from the fallen man, and raises 
     his barrel to the man's forehead.

                      WOMAN (V.O.)
          ...Remember, "there's no where you 
          can go that you haven't learned how 
          to go in time... It's easy..."

                      HUSKY MAN
               (in severe pain)
          Whatever it is that I'm doing that 
          you don't like I'll stop doing it.

                      MARTIN
          It's not me.

     Martin cocks the gun....

     EXT. EAST-WEST HOLDING COMPANY, LOS ANGELES - DAY

     The perpetual sun shines down on a small lot of pre-fab office 
     bungalows.

     INT. BLANK HOLDING COMPANY

     A small suite of dry-walled offices.

     EAST-WEST HOLDING COMPANY

     is stenciled on glass doors behind Martin who stands in front 
     of a young woman reading from some kind of invitation. She 
     is MARCELLA MAYES.

                      MARCELLA
          ...So come on back to the old oak 
          tree, acorns. Signed, the reunion 
          committee."

     Marcella holds up the mauve envelope and smiles slyly. For 
     the first time, Martin looks scared.

                      MARTIN
          Throw that away.

                      MARCELLA
          This?

                      MARTIN
          Don't tease me. You know what I do 
          for a living.

                      MARCELLA
          It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. 
          How was the trip?

                      MARTIN
          Tedious. I now authorize you to throw 
          away all personal mail.

                      MARCELLA
          All of it?

                      MARTIN
          And not show it to me. Ever again.

                      MARCELLA
          That's going to cost.

                      MARTIN
          I'll pay.

     Martin begins to walk past her into his office, but Marcella 
     stops him.

                      MARCELLA
          They're not happy, sir.

                      MARTIN
          I'm not happy.

                      MARCELLA
          They say their friend was suppose to 
          have a heart attack and die in his 
          sleep.

                      MARTIN
          He didn't.

                      MARCELLA
          They blame you for the compromise.

                      MARTIN
          And they want me to make up for it.

                      MARCELLA
          In Detroit. This weekend.

                      MARTIN
          Tell them that's impossible. I need 
          my normal lead time.

                      MARCELLA
          They were very upset.

                      MARTIN
          Would you describe their position as 
          inflexible?

                      MARCELLA
          Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.

     Marcella looks concerned.

                      MARCELLA
          And sir, I also get that broken-
          mirror, black-cat, Friday-the-
          thirteenth kind of feeling about 
          this one....

                      MARTIN
          There's nothing to be done about it.

                      MARCELLA
          I liquidated the last account in 
          Zurich, and split it into two new 
          ones in Estonia.

                      MARTIN
          Good. What else? Anything interesting?

                      MARCELLA
          Mmm, not really. But you're gonna 
          love this one.

     She hands him a piece of paper. He scans it.

                      MARCELLA
          Enough?

                      MARTIN
          Never enough.

                      MARCELLA
          But it's a Greenpeace boat. It'd be 
          so easy.

     Martin looks at her wearily. He puts it into the paper 
     shredder at the side of her desk.

                      MARTIN
          I have scruples. Next.

                      MARCELLA
          Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's 
          a full dossier. Very comprehensive.

     She raises a thick brown dossier from the top of her desk 
     and puts it down again. Martin moves through a door to his 
     private office.

     MARTIN'S OFFICE

     Martin goes into his office and sits at his desk. On the 
     walls are a couple of boring prints of tallships. A bookshelf 
     holds trappings of a loose attempt at a cover-- a few shipping 
     manifests, sealane tables, and other specialized reference 
     books on import/export. He sits and stares.

     NEW ANGLE

     Time has passed, and Martin still sits at his desk massaging 
     his gums with a rubber-tipped dental pointer.

     C.U. MARTIN'S TEETH

     The dental tool jumps across the gaps between his teeth like 
     a hummingbird.

                      MARCELLA
               (off-screen)
          You should get going....

     MARTIN

     pulls back his jacket lapel and fits the utensil into a pocket 
     protector that is also home to a toothbrush, emery board, 
     tweezers, and comb. He stands and walks out of his office.

     FOYER

     Martin moves toward the door. As he passes Marcella she hands 
     him the mauve envelope and a travel portfolio.

                      MARCELLA
          Don't forget your identity.

                      MARTIN
          See you next week.

     Martin stops short as he reaches the threshold. He holds up 
     the envelope, and stares a dagger through it. On his way 
     out, over his shoulder...

                      MARTIN
          Tell Dr. Oatman I'm on my way.

     INT. DR. OATMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

     Martin slouches on a leather couch. He holds the mauve 
     envelope, now open.

                      DR. OATMAN (V.O.)
          Why don't you want to go to your 
          high school reunion?

                      MARTIN
          It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do 
          I have in common with those people? 
          Or with anyone?

     DR. OATMAN sits in the window. He is Kris Kringle-esque, and 
     wears a sheepskin vest, rough-hewn shirt, faded Levis, and 
     old Frye boots. Oatman nods with the suave understanding of 
     a man happy to collect fifty thousand in fees before asking 
     a tough question.

                      DR. OATMAN
          You went to school with these people.

                      MARTIN
          Come on.

                      DR. OATMAN
          We've spent a lot of time discussing 
          those years. Remember we said that 
          fear is a transfer of the bodily 
          hurt associated by experience with 
          the thing feared, to the thought of 
          the thing. Thus we fear a dog without 
          distinctly imagining its bite.

                      MARTIN
          Shouldn't you be taking notes?

                      DR. OATMAN
          Tell me about your vision of the 
          reunion.

     CLOSE-UP - MARTIN

                                           CUT TO:

     MARTIN'S P.O.V. - FROM ABOVE

     Of a crowded gymnasium. The alumni below stops what they are 
     doing and look up at Martin, DRAWING GUNS OF ALL SHAPES AND 
     SIZES AND OPEN FIRE ON MARTIN. THE UNITED FORCE INSTANTLY 
     DISINTEGRATES, AND ALL 400 PEOPLE TURN THEIR GUNS ON EACH 
     OTHER. A BLOODBATH ENSUES. ONE ALUMNI SHOOTS HER OWN HEAD 
     OFF, ANOTHER MOWS DOWN THE BAR, ETC.

                                      CUT BACK TO:

     MARTIN AND OATMAN

                      MARTIN
          It'll be depressing.

                      DR. OATMAN
          How do you know?

                      MARTIN
          I just know.

                      DR. OATMAN
          Say more.

                      MARTIN
          They'll have husbands and wives and 
          children and houses and dogs.... 
          made themselves a part of something. 
          And they can talk about what they 
          do. What am I going to say?
               (sarcastic)
          "I killed the President of Paraguay 
          with a fork."

     Oatman twitches nervously, almost spilling his coffee.

                      DR. OATMAN
          You needn't be so frank with me about 
          your work.

                      MARTIN
          Why not. I trust you. You couldn't 
          turn me in because of Doctor-Patient 
          privilege... and I don't want to be 
          "withholding"... and I know where 
          you live.

                      DR. OATMAN
          You know where I live?

                      MARTIN
          We're both professionals, Oatman.

                      DR. OATMAN
          I think what you fear Martin is 
          domesticity. It's the greatest fear 
          that men have who belong to Western 
          Culture. It's centuries old. Like 
          King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th 
          century who decided one day that he 
          was so bored with his dreary life at 
          home with his wife he thought, "Well, 
          wouldn't it be great if we hit the 
          road and fought... oh... the 
          Saracens."  So he put the word out 
          and was amazed when a million men 
          signed up and all of them wanted to 
          go and fight in distant lands and do 
          terrible things to people rather 
          than stay at home with their families.

                      MARTIN
          So you're saying that Ulysses--
          everything he said to his queen when 
          he came back--everything was a lie? 
          He just wanted to fuck around?

                      DR. OATMAN
          Yes.

                      MARTIN
          Mmm.

     Beat.

                      DR. OATMAN
          And how have you been feeling about 
          your... work lately?

                      MARTIN
          Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's 
          just getting hard to go to work in a 
          good mood. I'm starting to think 
          I've been in the business too long. 
          Last week I did a guy younger than 
          me.

     INT. CHURCH -

     SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS:

     MARTIN

     From the back of the darkened empty church, we see him mount 
     the altar.  A priest in fact.

     MARTIN'S HANDS

     open the gilded doors to reveal the chalice. He removes it, 
     squirts a clear liquid into the cup, and swishes it out. He 
     returns the chalice to the cabinet.

                      MARTIN (V.O.)
          The church seems to be purging itself 
          of it's pedophile.

     MARTIN

     Sits in the back pew of the church, now crowded for Mann. He 
     watches the PRIEST lift the chalice into the air, murmur a 
     prayer, and drink from it. The Priest collapses behind the 
     altar.

                      MARTIN (V.O.)
          It's a bull market.

     C.U. OF ALTAR CARPET

     The chalice bounces free from the Priest's hand as it hits 
     the ground.

                      MARTIN (V.O.)
          Anyway, that never use to happen. I 
          was always the prodigy. Now I'm just 
          one of the guys.

                      DR. OATMAN (V.O.)
          Maybe some of the discomfort you're 
          feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over 
          the innocent people you've killed.

     INT. OATMAN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                      MARTIN
          If I show up at your door, chances 
          are you did something to bring me 
          there. I don't care about that stuff, 
          anyway.

                      DR. OATMAN
          What stuff?

                      MARTIN
               (dismissive)
          Morality.

     Oatman's glad the session's just about over.

                      DR. OATMAN
          Go to your reunion, Martin. See those 
          people and discover what they mean 
          to you. Try not to kill anybody for 
          a few days, see how you feel.

                      MARTIN
          If I get antsy I'll kill a few small 
          animals.

                      OATMAN
          Now we're making progress.

     INT. CONDO - NIGHT

     Very dark. No pictures or plants. Almost no furniture, and 
     what he does have is black. The only sign of life is a CAT. 
     The cat watches on as Martin sorts through a cardboard box, 
     finally coming to a photo album.

                      CAT
          Meow.

                      MARTIN
          Just a minute.

     INSERT-ALBUM

     A teen-aged Martin Blank: shy boy with a nervous smile. He 
     poses with his mother, an older woman with a kind smile... 
     but her eyes are dark; aged by a life of work and worry. On 
     the opposing page is a gilt funeral announcement that reads: 
     "IN LOVING MEMORY... VISTOR ALLEN BLANK...."

     MARTIN

     turns the page.

     INSERT-PHOTO ALBUM

     A photograph of a tall, thin girl: a bright smile from within 
     a bulky winter coat. A girl he's always wondered about: DEBI 
     NEWBERRY. Handwritten on the photo in girlish loops: "Would 
     you rather...?!"

                      CAT
          Meow!

     INT. KITCHEN - SAME

     Martin pulls himself away from the album and the cat follows 
     him, moaning hungrily--

                      MARTIN
          Food soon...

     Martin opens a restaurant-style refrigerator. It holds various 
     bottles of vitamins, spirulina, wheatgrass, digestible 
     hydrogen peroxide, fluoride treatment, oxygenated mouth rinse, 
     and thirty cans of CATFOOD.

                      MARTIN
          Tuna or liver?

                      CAT
          Meow.

                      MARTIN
          Tuna it is.

     He opens a can for the cat and a bottle for himself. While 
     the cat eats, he returns to the cardboard box. Finds a 
     YEARBOOK. Flips it open....

     INSERT-YEARBOOK

     A picture of a senior class "Blues Brothers" party: a group 
     of teens mug to the camera in Blues Brothers get-ups. 
     Sprinters race for a finish line, their chests stretching 
     for the tape.

     DEBI NEWBERY'S SENIOR PICTURE

     A more mature version of the girl in the album. Her name 
     appears under his picture...

     INT. GROCER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Track light fills the gourmet-rustic kitchen. GROCER stands, 
     wearing a burgundy Fila sweat suit, pushing beets into a 
     vegetable juicer. Next to the juicer are piles of celery and 
     carrots, as well. A low-key BLIP is heard from another room. 
     Grocer tops off the glass and takes it out of the kitchen.

     INT. GROCER'S GREAT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Grocer enters the main room of the villa-style A-frame. He 
     moves to an antique oak desk and sits in front of a COMPUTER.

     ON-SCREEN GRAPHICS

            "Click OK for remote access caller"

     OK is clicked.

             "Availability for two days in Detroit area"

                     "Terms"

                    "$560,000"

                      "When"

                      "Now"

                    "OK/ FAX materials"

     Grocer leans back in his chair and sips the juice. After a 
     moment, the FAX machine on the desk rattles. The computer 
     beeps.

       "confirmation number of wire transfer#: AJ6687-OI99471"

     Grocer hits the return button after taking in the number. A 
     graphic appears:

          "Connection is terminated/ Status idle"

     Grocer's FAX begins to moan and chatter. Grocer raises his 
     juice glass to the computer in a lazy toast.

     INT. PLANE - NIGHT

     Martin reclines in first class, soaring toward the Midwest 
     on the red-eye. He has already scanned his magazines and 
     they are piled in the empty seat next to him. He sets aside 
     a Powerbar. Martin reads Kill Without Joy. After a moment, 
     he sets the book down and takes up Iron John.

     INT. DETROIT AIRPORT TERMINAL - EARLY MORNING

     At the edge of the airport bar sits LARDNER and MCCULLERS, 
     two Government Spooks, agency unknown. They are both in 
     blazers, no ties, early thirties, and they watch the passing 
     crowd.

                      LARDNER
          You always say that. You always say 
          that. I'm telling you, you never met 
          the man.

                      MCCULLERS
          Seventeen months ago I was posting a 
          walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He 
          never saw me. But I saw him, though.

                      LARDNER
          Lisbon?

                      MCCULLERS
          In Portugal, yes.

     In the background, Martin passes by them as he walks down 
     the hall. Without directly regarding him, the two stand, 
     drop some cash on the bar, and begin to leave.

                      LARDNER
          Here's the news: He hasn't been in 
          Portugal since '90. I know that from 
          the file. Why don't you read the 
          file, man?

                      MCCULLERS
          In fact, I think I talked with him, 
          in Bonn.

     Lardner can neither confirm nor deny this.

                      LARDNER
          You always say that. You always have 
          to know everybody. Why don't I just 
          take the weekend off and let you 
          kill him. Since you two are so close.

     They exit.

     EXT. EXIT RAMP, DETROIT AIRPORT - MORNING

     INSIDE MARTIN'S CAR

     Martin, in a black Lincoln Town Car, veers off of the airport 
     artery and on to a turnpike. The radio broadcasts the news.

                      BROADCAST (V.O.)
          ...with highs today in the upper 
          seventies. Related stocks on Wall 
          Street today as scandal continues to 
          rock the joint U.S.-Japanese Tech 
          Center...

     MARTIN'S CAR

     blows past CAMERA and on down the road. After a beat, a mid-
     eighties Ford Country Squire station wagon follows, occupied 
     by two figures.

     INSIDE THE COUNTRY SQUIRE

     are Lardner and McCullers. They listen to the same broadcast.

                      BROADCAST (V.O.)
          ...An unknown "whistle-blower" has 
          leaked a number of critical flaws in 
          the safety designs of next year's 
          models to authorities that could 
          cost millions in recalls....

     MARTIN

     flips through the dial, pausing on Rush Limbaugh who waxes 
     fascistically.

                      MARTIN
          Mein hero.

     ...and then turns the dial again and cuts in on "Armageddon 
     Time," slow reggae vibe by The Clash.

     EXT. HIGHWAY-

     Martin drives down the roadway... headlong into his past. 
     Dig it...

     INT. MARTIN'S CAR

     Martin turns up the volume as he reacts to a familiar 
     voice....

                      FEMALE DEEJAY (V.O.)
               (on radio)
          --this is WFRN, all vinyl, all the 
          time. Oldies from the eighties. It's 
          a cold summer day in Grosse Pointe--

                                           CUT TO:

     CLOSE-UP - A FULL, FEMALE MOUTH

     lit only by dime slivers of sunlight, in front of a 
     microphone. Stray, gossamer strands of hair hanging in her 
     face move in front of her mouth as she speaks....

                      FEMALE DEEJAY
          --and I'm ready for some good tunes 
          and angry talk. Or angry tunes and 
          good talk--

                                           CUT TO:

     MARTIN

     looking somewhere far away, beyond what is before him in the 
     windshield...

                      FEMALE DEEJAY (V.O.)
          --Or maybe we'll just play the Cocteau 
          Twins and get over the goo-angry-
          talking music. As you know--

                                           CUT TO:

     THE DEEJAY'S HANDS

     as they distractedly toy with the wire at the base of the 
     mic.

                      FEMALE DEEJAY (V.O.)
          --for some moments in life there are 
          no words, and a little nonsense now 
          and then is relished by the wisest 
          man--

                                           CUT TO:

     MARTIN

     still rapt, makes a sharp turn into a shopping district.

                                           CUT TO:

     HER MOUTH

                      FEMALE DEEJAY
          --The Cocteau Twins, though also a 
          band of the nineties, will be aired 
          due to the fact that they created 
          their own language to sing by--

                                           CUT TO:

     MARTIN

     slows on a quaint street of cute shops. He creeps up to a 
     storefront on hid right and stops, staring through the 
     passenger window....

                                           CUT TO:

     DEBI NEWBERRY

     the female deejay. She sits slumped in a well-worn executive 
     chair, her back to the studio console and the picture window 
     behind it that opens to the street....

                      DEBI
          --Now that's freedom--

     she swivels in the chair to face the street....

     DEBI'S P.O.V.

     of Martin's Town Car outside, Martin silhouetted in shadow.

     DEBI

     Her brow furrowed as she peers at the car, something summoned 
     by the dark figure. Her words falter almost imperceptibly.

                      DEBI
          --The best I can do is a rhyme: Where 
          are all the good men dead? In the 
          heart or in the head? Back later....

     MARTIN

     Shaken from his trance by her stare, pulls back into the 
     street and disappears....

     INT. MARTIN'S CAR - MORNING

     Martin drives, listening to the radio. He turns the corner 
     with an expectant look on his face. Suddenly his face drops 
     as he slows and pulls over....

     MARTIN'S P.O.V. - 7-11 STORE

     Martin looks left of the store, then right, behind him, then 
     back at the store. Bewildered, he gets out of the car.

     WIDE SHOT

     of Martin as he walks with purpose. He halts in the middle 
     of the lot. He puts his hands on his hips, stares, then moves 
     in... We stay wide as he enters the store and addresses the 
     clerk inside.

                      MARTIN
          What are you doing here?

     CARL, the store clerk tries to get a grip on this question.

                      CARL
          A double shift. What's it look like?
               (softening)
          Can I help you with something?

     Martin's head pans the room, processing.

                      MARTIN
          I don't think so.

     EXT. 7-11 PAYPHONE - MORNING

     Martin continues to gaze at the structure as if it's a lunar 
     landscape.

                      MARTIN
               (into phone)
          Dr. Oatman. Dr. Oatman. Please pick 
          up if you're there... It's Martin 
          Blank. It's gone. My house. It's not 
          here. My house is gone and now there's 
          a 7-11 here... And that's 
          unfortunate... You can never go home 
          again, Dr. Oatman.

     Martin hangs up. He watches one-stop shoppers come and go.

                      MARTIN
               (to himself)
          But I guess you can shop there.

     INT. NURSING HOME - DAY

     MARTIN'S P.O.V.

     of a NURSE leading him down a drab, antiseptic hallway. She 
     banks into the sunlit room where a wispy woman in her late 
     fifties sits expectantly on the edge of the bed clutching 
     her purse in one hand, a filterless Pall-Mall in the other, 
     a light coat on. This is MARY BLANK. She suffers from 
     Alzheimer's or something just as debilitating.

                      NURSE
          Mary, your son's here.

     The nurse gently eases Mary up. Martin hugs Mary stiffly and 
     pats her shoulders. Mary takes hold of Martin's arm. They 
     start out of the room.

     EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

     They walk past a school-yard park fitted with a set of swings, 
     baseball diamonds, and a small grove of trees. She smokes 
     and hacks.

                      MARY
          I bought a new rug.

                      MARTIN
          That's wonderful, Mom.

                      MARY
          What's a revival tent?

                      MARTIN
          It's a place where religious people--

                      MARY
               (knowingly)
          Marlin Perkins and Jim!

                      MARTIN
          Jim?

                      MARY
          His assistant. He acted like Marlin's 
          son, only he wasn't. At least they 
          never said he was... I bet they were 
          lovers, faggots. Yes, gay lovers. 
          Wild Kingdom my ass!

     Mary coughs horribly.

                      MARTIN
          It's good to see you. I'm sure you're 
          curious about what I've been doing.

                      MARY
          I spoke to your father the other 
          day.

                      MARTIN
          I imagine that'd be rather difficult.

                      MARY
          Nature made him then broke the mold.

     Martin decides to change the subject.

                      MARTIN
          They told me you're taking lithium, 
          mom.

                      MARY
          Yes, they give me headaches. I have 
          a headache.

                      MARTIN
          You have a headache?

                      MARY
          I have a headache. You have a 
          headache?

                      MARTIN
          No, I don't have one.

                      MARY
          You don't have a headache. I have a 
          headache.

     Mary leans in close, smiling.

                      MARY
          We had a good laugh, didn't we?

                      MARTIN
          Yeah. I guess we did.

     EXT. NURSING HOME - DAY

     As they head toward Martin's car, Mary stops and points to 
     it.

                      MARY
          Why don't you return this car and 
          borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to 
          the rent-a-car so you can get a ride 
          back.

                      MARTIN
          I think I'll go see Debi today.

                      MARY
          Of course you will.

                      MARTIN
          I can't think of anything to say to 
          her that seems appropriate given I 
          left and never said goodbye to her.

                      MARY
          Take care of her. She's a keeper.

                      MARTIN
          Yeah...

                      MARY
          And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro 
          on foreign exchange?

                      MARTIN
          I have always thought about her and 
          missed her.

     A nurse approaches with a wheelchair.

                      MARY
          Separate the wheat from the chaff 
          and you've got the candle cat.

     Together, Martin and the nurse help Mary into it. Mary gazes 
     at Martin, taking him in.

                      MARY
          Remember no matter how impossible 
          your problems feel. I've known people 
          without a chance in the world. And 
          all of a sudden, they have lives.  
          Time allows miracles. Let yourself 
          breathe, son.

     Martin bends down and kisses her on the cheek. The nurse 
     spins the chair around and heads toward the building. He is 
     somewhat fatigued from the experience, but he tries once 
     more to connect.

                      MARTIN
          Mom...

     The nurse stops and turns Mary around to face him. Mary looks 
     up at Martin and brightens. She starts to sing out like Ethel 
     Merman, arms out Broadway style.

                      MARY
          "What's up doc/ what's cookin'?/ 
          What's up doc?/ Are ya lookin'?/ 
          Hey! Look out!  You're gonna hurt 
          someone,/ with that old shotgun,/ 
          Hey... what's... up... Doooooc...!/ 
          We really mean it!"

     Mary stops short, and squints at Martin.

                      MARY
          Hey, you're a handsome devil. What's 
          your name?

     EXT. GRAVEYARD ROAD - DAY

     Martin stops the car and looks out the window at the sea of 
     headstones. He jerks his hand in a stiff wave...

                      MARTIN
          Hey Pop... You got off easy. The 
          house is a 7-11. Mom's a psycho-
          pharmacological punching bag and I 
          murder for cash. If you were here I 
          think you'd be proud.

     He drives off.

     INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - DAY

     The room features a big square bed, dresser and television. 
     Martin enters, kicks a leather bag under the bed, and grabs 
     the steel-sided briefcase.

                      MARTIN
          pries out a wall vent, slides in the 
          case and replaces the vent.

     EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

     Lardner and McCullers are staked out along the main strip of 
     town. Lardner snores, face pressed up against the passenger 
     window. McCullers lays back in his seat, a to-go cup in his 
     lap. He taps the cup with one finger as he absently sings 
     his favorite Bob Seeger song to himself...

                      MCCULLERS
          "...Against the wind... just a young 
          man running... Against the wind... 
          let the cowboy's ride!... Blame on 
          it the thuuunder! Night moves..."

     McCullers catches of Martin's Town Car coming down the street. 
     He nudges Lardner, and points.

     LARDNER AND MCCULLERS P.O.V.

     of Martin pulling into a space on the street outside the 
     radio station. He gets out, looking nervous.

     INT. RADIO STATION - DAY

     Debi flips on the "ON-AIR" switch and prepares to speak into 
     the microphone. Martin walks in. Debi sees him. They stare 
     at each other. The song ends. Dead air. After a moment...

                      DEBI
               (on air, groping)
          WRFN playing all vinyl, all the time. 
          Oldies from the eighties. That was 
          ah... the Specials. Doing... one of 
          their songs...

     Debi turns to turntable B and finds it empty. She turns back 
     to turntable A and lets the record roll on.

                      DEBI
          ...and here's another.

     Debi swivels around to face Martin.

                      MARTIN
          "Oldies from the eighties?"

     After a long pause....

                      DEBI
          I just play my own collection.

                      MARTIN
          It's nice to see you again.

     Debi says nothing, just stares at him, in shock.

                      MARTIN
          How long has it been?

                      DEBI
          Since you stood me up on prom night 
          and vanished without saying a word?

                      MARTIN
          Ten years, I think. What I miss?

     Debi slowly grooves into irony, her best defense.

                      DEBI
          Well, let me see... they tore down 
          the George Orwell monument and put 
          up a bust of George Michael. Main 
          Street's a four-laner, no left turns 
          four to seven. I was married and 
          divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now 
          officially the new sister city to 
          Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have 
          fiber-optic town meetings every two 
          months.

                      MARTIN
          Here is now there. There is here.

     Their eyes lock on each other...

                      DEBI
          Those are the headlines.

     The request line buzzes.

                      DEBI
          Hold that thought.
               (into phone)
          WRFN FM, Grosse Pointe. All vinyl, 
          all the...
               (pauses)
          No Pearl Jam. Call back in ten years.

     Beat. Debi makes the move.

                      DEBI
          Tell me about yourself.

                      MARTIN
          I'm in California most of the time. 
          Traveling a lot on business. That's 
          about it, really.

                      DEBI
          That's it?

                      MARTIN
          Not much else.

                      DEBI
          What's your business?

                      MARTIN
          I'm a professional killer.

                      DEBI
          Professional killer. Do you get dental 
          with that?

     Beat.

                      MARTIN
          Well, I'm in town for a few days, 
          anyway.

     They run out of words, the moment too big for small talk. 
     Martin gets the fear, breaks it off.

                      MARTIN
          Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.

                      DEBI
          Okay.

     Martin leaves Debi sitting alone, in disbelief.

     EXT. RADIO STATION - DAY

     Martin steps out of the storefront station along the 
     fashionable Grosse Pointe shopping district. He stops in the 
     middle of the street with a strained look on his face.

     INT. LARDNER & MCCULLERS' COUNTRY SQUIRE - SAME

     LARDNER & MCCULLERS' P.O.V.

     of Martin standing in the street.

     LARDNER AND MCCULLERS

     They frown, wondering at Martin's next move.

     INT. DEEJAY BOOTH -

     Debi lost in thought, still. After a moment, she sits upright 
     and flips the "ON-AIR" switch.

                      DEBI
               (into mike)
          A man comes to you. He is from the 
          past bringing you pain long since 
          put behind you. He says peculiar 
          things and leaves abruptly. It all 
          comes flooding back...

     EXT. STREET -

     Martin stops in his tracks. His face softens, then becomes 
     determined. He turns and walks back toward the station.

     INT. DEEJAY BOOTH -

     Debi broadcasting...

                      DEBI
          It felt like an apparition, or some 
          cheap, gruesome Rod Serling time 
          warp I'd been thrust back into without 
          warning. There's a strangeness in 
          the air and I don't mind telling 
          you, I'm a little spooked. He was a 
          man from my past. A man I loved. A 
          man who disappeared.

     DEBI'S P.O.V.

     of Martin walking back into the station.

                      DEBI
          A man who's walking back into the 
          station.

     Martin comes into the booth. The temperature rises as they 
     square off.

     INT. COUNTRY SQUIRE -

                      LARDNER
          Well?

                      MCCULLERS
          I don't think so.

                      LARDNER
          Well, remember when Frysal's men 
          paid off the Deejay in Cairo to 
          announce a bogus press conference in 
          the --

                      MCCULLERS
          --Nooo--

                      LARDNER
          --Yes. And the Munich Olympics in 
          '72. A local radio station started 
          broadcasting news of the massacre 
          two minutes before it happened.

     McCullers is not to be outdone.

                      MCCULLERS
          That's strictly Bàader-Meinhof stuff.

                      LARDNER
          It was the PLO.

                      MCCULLERS
          Whatever.

     INT. DEEJAY BOOTH

     Martin and Debi locked in a passionate embrace. They break 
     away.

                      DEBI
          Sit.

     Martin obeys. Debi clandestinely flips the "ON-AIR" switch 
     as she drops into her chair. The "ON-AIR" light bar goes on 
     above and behind Martin. Unbeknownst to him their conversation 
     is put out over the airwaves.

                      DEBI
          All right mystery man. I want some 
          answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. 
          Two young lovers with frightening 
          natural chemistry. The girl sits in 
          a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at 
          her father's house waiting for the 
          most romantic night of her young 
          life. The boy never shows up, until 
          now. So, what's the question?

                      MARTIN
          Where have I been?

                      DEBI
          More like what happened? What 
          happened, Mr. Blank?

                      MARTIN
          I don't know exactly. I could venture 
          a guess but it would sound like a 
          rationalization... I thought you 
          know... maybe seeing you, some 
          friends, my house... of course now a 
          7-11--

                      DEBI
          --Torn down in the name of convenience--

                      MARTIN
          --and I guess, sure, seeing you would 
          be part of that whole equation... I 
          suppose the most important thing, 
          really. I don't know. Anyway, this 
          whole thing's my therapist's idea. 
          It's my shrink, really.

                      DEBI
          Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?

                      MARTIN
          You see someone?

                      DEBI
          Uh, no. So you're back now, a decade 
          later, and you want to sort things 
          out with me. The question now is, do 
          I allow you... access... to my being?

     Martin says nothing.

                      DEBI
          All right then. Would you like to 
          share any more deeply personal 
          thoughts with our listening audience 
          before we go to our phone poll and 
          see how the folks in radioland come 
          down on this one?

     A beat as Martin realizes he's been had. He seems about to 
     bolt.

                      DEBI
          Should a broken-hearted girl give a 
          guy a second chance at love....

     Debi jabs a phone line on the console.

                      DEBI
               (HARD)
          You're on the air.

     Martin deflates.

                      OLD WOMAN'S VOICE
          I think this young man has avoided 
          the question completely. Has not 
          discussed "what happened" nor if 
          he's sorry for what he has done. 
          Therefore, I don't see any reason 
          why you should see him until he fully 
          discloses his intentions and feelings.

                      DEBI
          Thank you caller.

     Stabs another line.

                      DEBI
          You're on the air.

                      DUMB GUY VOICE
          Are you there?

                      DEBI
          Yes.

                      DUMB GUY VOICE
          No, the guy.

     Martin looks up, humiliated.

                      MARTIN
          Yeah....

                      DUMB GUY VOICE
          Uh... when you guys use to go out... 
          Did you guys ever... heh heh heh 
          heh... ever fuckin', ever totally 
          fuckin' heh heh heh-

                      DEBI
          Next caller.

                      GUFF MAN VOICE
          I don't know, Debi. Sounds like bad 
          gas to me. I would not allow him 
          access to your being.

                      DEBI
          Thank you.

                      DEBI
          Grosse Pointe Michigan, I hear you 
          loud and clear: "If you love something 
          set it free. If it comes back to you 
          it's, well...

     She turns to him and shrugs apologetically.

                      DEBI
          ...Broken...."

     Martin has his answer.

     EXT. RADIO STATION - DAY

     Martin leaves the station, alone and beaten down.

                      MARTIN
          Dammit. Never trust my instincts.

     He scans the main strip.

     MARTIN'S P.O.V.

     A MAN walks down the street. He is FELIX, a bookish, 
     forgettable man in his forties, wearing Le Coq Sportif sweats 
     and shoes. He looks as if he has a dark cloud over his head. 
     Martin's seen him somewhere, and doesn't like what he 
     remembers. Martin's POV TRACKS him.

     FELIX'S P.O.V.

     As he walks down the street, he spots the Country Squire, 
     and eyes Lardner and McCullers in the front seat.

     MARTIN'S P.O.V.

     follows Felix's eyes to Lardner and McCullers and catches 
     their look. Their eyes lock, neither wanting to betray that 
     they've made each other. They all do a pretty good job. His 
     P.O.V. swings to a square-jawed, hale fellow wearing dark 
     sunglasses who is approaching directly and only a few feet 
     away. The man is going for something in his breast pocket...

     Reaches into his own jacket, most likely for a gun....

     THE MAN

     pulls out a glasses case, and takes off his shades-- He is 
     PAUL SWIDERSKI.

     MARTIN AND PAUL

     Martin relaxes.

                      PAUL
               (grinning ear-to-ear)
          Hell, I would've voted for you, but 
          there's all this apple sauce stuck 
          in my phone... I don't wanna talk 
          about it. How the hell are you?!
               (extends his hand)
          Here's five good ones!

     No trace of recognition on Martin's face.

                      PAUL
          Marty! It's me. Paul.

                      MARTIN
               (realizing)
          Paul?

                      PAUL
               (re: hand)
          You're leaving me hanging here...

     They shake. Martin looks him up and down, astonished at the 
     respectable veneer of his old burn-out friend.

                      PAUL
          Hey. Give me a break.

     INT. PAUL'S BMW - DAY

     Martin and Paul rive through Grosse Pointe, Michigan: Wide 
     streets lined with huge, shady oaks. Castle-like homes on 
     golf-course green lawns. A comfortable, Midwestern Beverly 
     Hills. They are cruising their old haunts, Paul smoking a 
     joint.

                      PAUL
          This won't take but a minute. I just 
          gotta hold their hands for a final 
          walk-through. I'll take them in, get 
          'em out, then you and I can grab a 
          little quality time.

     Martin looks out the window, breathing in the past.

                      PAUL
          Goddamn, It's good to see you. I was 
          afraid you joined a cult or something. 
          I half-expected you to come back to 
          town in a fennel wreath and paper 
          pants.

     Paul offers Martin the joint. He declines.

                      MARTIN
          There was no money in it.

     Martin regards Paul archly.

                      MARTIN
               (grinning)
          So what happened to you?

                      PAUL
          Same thing that happened to you-- I 
          stopped poutin' there on the 
          sidelines. Got in. Got on the team.  
          I joined the working week, you slick 
          fucking asshole, so why don't you 
          valet park your high horse and take 
          it easy on your old buddy, Paul.

                      MARTIN
          Fair enough.

     Beat.

                      PAUL
          God it's great to see you.

                      MARTIN
          You too.

     EXT. FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT HOUSE - DAY

     MARTIN'S P.O.V.

     of a lovely YOUNG COUPLE on the front porch of a mid-sized 
     Wright home... Perhaps that could be him if things were 
     different, but for now it feels like along shot. Paul is 
     hawking the house to them out of earshot.

                      SOUTHTEC GUARD (V.O.)
          Well, we do what we have to do if we 
          find you on the property. But we 
          don't really enforce the law, we 
          execute company policy for homeowners.

     MARTIN AND THE GUARD

     standing in the driveway.

                      MARTIN
          So when are you authorized to use 
          deadly force?

                      SOUTHTEC GUARD
          Well, a 'course, taxes provide your 
          basic service-- police and whatnot. 
          But our customers need a little more 
          than just that, you understand? This 
          badge doesn't mean that I am a peace 
          officer.

     The woman turns at Martin and smiles. Martin smiles back.

                      MARTIN
          So it's not a meaningful symbol, or 
          anything. That badge is just the 
          badge of your company. If I look 
          suspicious on your customers' property--
          well, under those heightened 
          circumstances you have the authority 
          to, ah... To shoot me.

                      SOUTHTEC GUARD
          To shoot you. Correct.

                      MARTIN
          How did you get this job?

                      SOUTHTEC GUARD
          Well, they were hiring, and it was 
          only a two week course...

                      MARTIN
               (pleasantly)
          Wow.

     Paul walks the happy couple down the steps.

                      PAUL
               (to couple)
          ...What more can I say.

                      HUSBAND
               (smiling)
          We'll talk soon.

                      PAUL
               (much hand gesturing)
          You'll be raising your new family in 
          a work of art. A work of art in a 
          work of art.

     Paul looks at Martin and the Guard, inviting them into the 
     sell.

                      SOUTHTEC GUARD
          I'm sure you'll be very happy.

     All look to Martin....

                      MARTIN
               (heartfelt)
          When my time comes, if it ever does, 
          I want a beautiful, normal place 
          like this... and a wife like you...

     All are confused. Martin thumbs to the guard.

                      MARTIN
          ...and you'll be safe here...

     Paul looks at his shoes and rolls his shoulders.

     EXT. FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT HOUSE

     Lardner and McCullers sit in the wagon, watching the house 
     in the distance.

     INT. PAUL'S BMW - LATER

     Martin and Paul cut through a particularly charming 
     neighborhood.

                      PAUL
          Now. I don't make a habit of pimping 
          my friends, but there is one prime 
          little piece of land that you must 
          see...

     MARTIN'S P.O.V.

     A sprawling gingerbread mansion rises into view. A long and 
     winding driveway cuts through thickly wooded property to the 
     house.

                      MARTIN (V.O.)
          Debi's house.

                      PAUL (V.O.)
          Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?

     C.U. OF MARTIN

                      MARTIN
          No. You drove us here.

                      PAUL
          Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, 
          isn't it?

                      MARTIN
          No.

     Martin's not listening. His eyes track the house out the 
     window.

     MARTIN'S P.O.V.

     of the mansion.

     They roll slowly by Debi's house.

     They drive in silence for a beat. Paul suddenly swerves to 
     the shoulder, jams the brake, and turns on Martin.

                      PAUL
          Ten years. What happened!?

                      MARTIN
          I freaked out, joined the Army, worked 
          for the government, and went into 
          business for myself... I'm a 
          professional killer.

                      PAUL
          Thank you.

     Paul, satisfied, gets back on the road.

                      PAUL
          Professional killer, huh? Does that 
          come with a good HMO?

     EXT. ROAD - DAY

     Paul makes a turn. They approach a large car dealership. The 
     sign above it says

            "DESTEPHANO'S BAVARIAN MOTOR WORKS"

                      MARTIN
               (looking ahead)
          He sells BMW's?

                      PAUL
          He sold me this bad boy.

                      MARTIN
          How could you put your hard-earned 
          dollars into the hands of the class 
          bully?

                      PAUL
          He gave me a great deal.

                      MARTIN
          Mein Dealer.

     Paul slows outside the lot. BOB DESTEPHANO-- a big, angry-
     looking man in an expensive suit-- stands in the lot, puffing 
     up amidst his stable of expensive cars.

                      PAUL
          Hey! Bob! The car's running great.

                      BOB
               (dismissive)
          Glad to hear it.

     Bob turns his back on them and begins to walk away.

                      MARTIN
               (shouts)
          Bob...

                      BOB
               (turning)
          What?

                      MARTIN
          It's me. Martin Blank.

                      BOB
          Really...? So what?

                      MARTIN
          Okay. See you later.

     EXT. RADIO STATION - NIGHT

     Martin climbs out of Paul's car and begins to walk toward 
     his own. Paul calls after him.

                      PAUL
          See you at the left-a-boy-came-back-
          a-man-made-good party.

     Martin nods him off. Paul pulls away.

     MARTIN

     stands across the street from the radio station, looking at 
     Debi in the window... Martin draws a thin rifle scope from 
     his back pocket, and lifts it to his eye...

     MARTIN'S P.O.V. - SCOPE

     of Debi, in the crosshairs, bored, tapping a pencil to the 
     beat of an unheard song.

     MARTIN

     dejected. He puts the scope away and gets in his car.

     INT. 7-11 - NIGHT

     Martin walks into the store, looking around once again at 
     his old home. To the left of the door, a typical suburban 
     teenage SKATEBOARDER is lost in the "Mortal Combat" video 
     game and something too loud from his walkman. Carl, still 
     working the double, nods to Martin.

                      CARL
          Can I help you?

                      MARTIN
          What's done is done.

     Martin moves up one aisle to the gum rack. He picks out a 
     pack of Beaman's and unwraps a stick as he heads to the 
     counter. On the way, he makes a black Town Car pulling into 
     a spot next to his own. He immediately changes course, and 
     bee-lines for a rear aisle where he ducks down...

     FELIX

     Comes through the door, drawing a Mac-10 for each hand.

     MARTIN

     grabs the gum out of his mouth and sticks it onto the bottom 
     of the Glock .9mm he has produced from somewhere in his suit.

     CARL

     grabs the cash drawer, sets it on the counter, and puts his 
     hands up.

     THE SKATEBOARDER

     Plays on.

     FELIX AND CARL

     Felix shoots CARL DEAD on his way toward

     MARTIN

     Bolts up the cooler aisle. Bursts of FIRE follow him, taking 
     out each freezer door behind him.

     MARTIN AND FELIX

     EXCHANGE FIRE John Woo-style between the aisles of the cramped 
     store. Felix delivers a close-to-home burst as he jumps the 
     counter, sending Martin diving out of view.

     MARTIN

     pinned behind the Slurpee machine, pauses to reload his now 
     two Glock nines. Martin steals a glance to get a bead on 
     Felix and is met with a salvo that rocks the Slurpee machine, 
     spattering him with several flavors... and that's all he can 
     take. Martin comes up BLASTING with both guns, but all that's 
     left of Felix is swinging doors and squealing tires.

     Martin moves to the cashier island, low to the ground.

     THE SKATEBOARDER

     Twitches and jerks, still absorbed in his game and oblivious 
     to the surrounding carnage.

     CASHIER ISLAND

     Martin crawls through the waist-level swinging door and moves 
     to Carl.

     CARL

     is really dead. Martin rolls him over to check it out and 
     finds

     A BOMB

     under the corpse.

     MARTIN

     Flips the corpse back on top of the device and leaps the 
     counter toward the doors. He grabs the shoulder or the 
     Skateboarder, who shrugs him off, annoyed--

                      SKATEBOARDER
          What the fuck, man?!

     The video game screen explodes. Shot full of Martin's bullets. 
     The Skateboarder reacts backward and Martin jerks him out of 
     the double doors.

     EXT. 7-11 - CONTINUOUS

     The Skateboarder is running like crazy, and Martin's car is 
     peeling out in reverse as the 7-11 is blown to hell.

     INT. MARTIN'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

     Martin's hair is matted with Slurpee as he tries to drive 
     and cool out. He sees his do in the mirror, pulls out a comb 
     and starts to comb it back into a slick Pat Riley style.

     EXT. RADIO STATION - NIGHT

     Martin walks in, not looking half bad, considering. Debi 
     looks up from some reading. "Naïve Melody" by the Talking 
     Heads plays in the studio.

                      MARTIN
          Are you going to the reunion?

                      DEBI
          No. I'm not going. Is that why you're 
          here?

                      MARTIN
          That's part of it.

                      DEBI
          Well, you'll have a ball. You seem 
          to have everything everybody wants 
          when they go back. The car, the suit, 
          the watch. The look. That just leaves 
          the little things, like happiness, 
          character, point of view...

                      MARTIN
          It's always the little things.

                      DEBI
          Yep.

     Beat.

                      MARTIN
          I'm wondering how you've been. How 
          you are. I'd like to catch up with 
          you. If it's possible.

     Beat as Debi considers. She spins her seat to face him.

                      DEBI
          Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.

                      MARTIN
          Well, there's not much to tell.

                      DEBI
          I'm sure you've done worthwhile things 
          in the last ten years. You've had 
          experiences.

                      MARTIN
          Bad experiences.

                      DEBI
          You met people.

                      MARTIN
          Bad people.

                      DEBI
          Watched television?

                      MARTIN
          Bad television.

                      DEBI
               (amused)
          Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It 
          sounds like you need a Shockabuku.

                      MARTIN
          What's that?

                      DEBI
          It's a swift spiritual kick to the 
          head that alters your reality forever.

                      MARTIN
          That'd be good.

     Beat.

                      DEBI
          What do you want?

     The question is open.

                      MARTIN
          I figured I could pick you up tomorrow 
          around seven o'clock.

                      DEBI
          Let me get this straight, are you 
          asking me out?

                      MARTIN
          Yes.

                      DEBI
          Unbelievable.

                      MARTIN
          Seven it is.

                      DEBI
          I'll think about it.

     EXT. JOSHUA TREE CAMPSITE - NIGHT

     Under a crisp and starry night, a man and a woman sit around 
     a campfire. As we MOVE CLOSER we see that the woman is 
     Marcella reading, "Women Who Run With Wolves."  She tends to 
     s'mores on the campfire, assembles one, and hands it to MONTY, 
     her young outdoorsman boyfriend. Monty is perched on a small 
     boulder, engaged in a Tai-Chi-like ritual, wearing Patagonia's 
     finest. There is a path of crystals leading from the fire to 
     the boulder. In the background is a tent and a Nissan 
     Pathfinder. Monty's watch goes off.

                      MONTY
          Baby, it's eight o'clock.

     Marcella gets up.

                      MARCELLA
          Thanks, Monty.

     She tousles Monty's hair on the way to the truck.

     INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

     Marcella gets in. She shuts the door and dials the phone.

                      MARCELLA
          Hey there, how'd it go?

     INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - NIGHT - INTERCUT

     Martin sits on the edge of the bed in a towel.

                      MARTIN
          It isn't done.

     Marcella pauses, taking this in.

                      MARCELLA
          This is not good.

                      MARTIN
          I'll do it tomorrow.

     Marcella considers this.

                      MARCELLA
          What's it look like?

                      MARTIN
          It's fine.

                      MARCELLA
          You haven't looked at the dossier.

                      MARTIN
               (a little defensive)
          I've looked at it.

     Martin eyes the vent.

                      MARCELLA
          You have.

                      MARTIN
          Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing 
          remarkable about it at all.

                      MARCELLA
          I have to call the client and give 
          them a reason why you're late.

                      MARTIN
          Tell them my house exploded.

     Beat. Marcella doesn't know what to make of this.

                      MARCELLA
          I'll call them and tell them you're 
          taking your time. Being a 
          professional.

                      MARTIN
          Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if 
          you could find out why they double-
          booked the job, and who is trying to 
          kill me, and call me back-- that's 
          be great.

                      MARCELLA
          Will do.

     Martin hangs up. He moves up to the air vent, deciding to 
     get down to business. He pries it open, and withdraws his 
     briefcase, putting it down on the bed and propping it open. 
     He looks at the unopened dossier for a moment, flips it over 
     in his hands, and tosses it on the bed.

     BRIEFCASE

     We catch a glimpse of Martin's weapons. Martin picks up the 
     envelope and is about to tear the seal when

     THE PHONE RINGS

     Martin drops the envelope and lifts the receiver.

                      DEBI
               (filtered)
          Are you there?

                      MARTIN
          Yes.

                      DEBI
          Pick me up at my father's house at 
          around seven. And don't be late this 
          time.

     Beat.

                      DEBI
          Hello...?

                      MARTIN
          This night, this reunion will be an 
          important step in our relationship.

                      DEBI
          You're fucking psycho.

                      MARTIN
          Don't rush to judgement until all 
          the facts are in.

     She hangs up. Martin smiles and replaces the receiver. He 
     turns to the apparatus laid out on the bed.

     GUNS, BULLETS, ETC.

     What has been his life is beginning to look more like death 
     to him. He places the envelope in the case, then returns the 
     case to its hiding place.

     EXT. DINER - DAY

     Lardner and McCullers stake out Martin from the Country Squire 
     across the street.

                      MCCULLERS
          I wish he'd do his job already so we 
          could do our job.

                      LARDNER
          We can't do our job unless he does 
          his job.

                      MCCULLERS
          Why don't we just do his job then, 
          so we can do our job, and get the 
          fuck out of here.

                      LARDNER
          Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded 
          killer.

                      MCCULLERS
          Wait a minute--

                      LARDNER
          -Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, 
          but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until 
          a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and 
          then you come in and kill the Bad 
          Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.

                      MCCULLERS
          So if we do his job, we're the bad 
          guys. If we do our job, we're the 
          good guys.

                      LARDNER
          Yup.

     They both laugh, as if at some great joke. Their laughter is 
     caught short by the sight of

     LARDNER AND MCCULLERS' POV

                      GROCER
          moving into the diner.

     INT. DINER - LATE MORNING

     Martin sits in a window booth splitting nutrient caplets 
     into an apple juice and looking out the window.

     GROCER

     slides into the booth, across from Martin.

     MARTIN AND GROCER

     Martin draws a nasty little PPK pistol from his waist, and 
     levels it at Grocer under the table-- but Grocer is already 
     drawing his pistol down there, and there is an instant Mexican 
     breakfast stand-off.

                      GROCER
          Easy, tiger.

     A waitress approaches.

                      WAITRESS
          Hi. Welcome to B.I. McCafferty's. My 
          name is Melanie and I'll be your 
          server this morning. Let me tell you 
          about some of our specials. Today we 
          have the "Alfalfa on My Mind," our 
          feature omelette. And there's our 
          "Gatsby's West Egg Omelette." And if 
          you're in the mood for something 
          different there's the "I left my 
          heart in San Franchezie."

     Martin and Grocer's eyes remain locked.

                      GROCER
          I want two eggs poached, hash brown 
          well-done. English muffin for the 
          bread. And a coffee.

                      MARTIN
          Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg-
          white omelette.

                      WAITRESS
          What would you like in the omelette?

                      MARTIN
          Nothing in the omelette. Nothing at 
          all.

     The waitress nods pertly and leaves.

                      GROCER
               (re: the omelette)
          Come on, live a little. I'm sorry 
          about the incident yesterday.

                      MARTIN
          No harm no foul.

                      GROCER
          A little misunderstanding among my 
          associates.

     Beat.

                      GROCER
          I told them to kill you and they 
          didn't.

                      MARTIN
          Hard to get good help these days.

                      GROCER
          But since we're both here, I think 
          it's time to take a fresh look at 
          our relationship.

                      MARTIN
          I didn't get into this business to 
          have "associates." And I don't want 
          to join your Goddamned union. "Loner--
          " "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my 
          own." That's the whole point. Why 
          don't you become a cop, or something. 
          You can drink coffee in the morning... 
          with friends!

     Grocer looks a little hurt.

                      MARTIN
               (easing up)
          Look, this is a one-on-one business... 
          Every time you get to know people, 
          bad things happen. If it'll make you 
          feel any better, this is my last 
          job. So what do you say we put our 
          guns away and forget the whole damn 
          thing.

     Grocer loses it.

                      GROCER
          Fuck you! No scabs! From now on, 
          everything's regulated!

     Long beat as Grocer gets a hold of himself.

                      MARTIN
          No deal.

                      GROCER
          Fine. But we're not going to let you 
          do your job. Because we're gonna do 
          it. And then, after we do your job, 
          we're gonna do another little job...

                      MARTIN
               (Wry)
          Is that right?

                      GROCER
          Yeah-- after I shoot you through the 
          fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you 
          in the bullethole.

                      MARTIN
          Nice talk, Sugarmouth.

     INT. SUITE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Martin sits at a desk, staring at the reunion card. He tosses 
     it aside, gets up, and moves in front of a mirror. He wears 
     a crisp black suit and practices his greeting smile...

                      MARTIN
               (trying on smile)
          Yes, I'm a pet psychiatrist. I sell 
          couch insurance. I test-market 
          positive thinking. I lead a weekend 
          men's group, actually. We specialize 
          in ritual killings. I'm hungry, are 
          you hungry, I'm hungry, oooh, ooh.
               (sarcastic)
          Hi, I'm Martin Blank, remember me?  
          I'm not married, I have no kids and 
          I'd blow your brains out if someone 
          paid me enough... So how've you been? 
          Where do you stand on The Issues? 
          Are you Left? Right? Up, down, proud, 
          shamed, blahblahblahblah--

     EXT. DEBI'S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

     Martin makes his way up the walk leading to the front door, 
     holding a simple bouquet of flowers. He skips up the front 
     steps and finds the doorbell. After a moment, Debi answers.

                      DEBI
          Flowers. That's funny.

                      MARTIN
          As long as I get the laugh.

                      DEBI
               (taking them)
          Here. Let me put these in some rubbing 
          alcohol.

     She backs into the house, and he follows.

     INT. NEWBERRY FOYER - CONTINUOUS

     Martin follows Debi into the hall. Both are enjoying this 
     atavistic ritual.

                      MARTIN
          You look beautiful.

                      DEBI
          Okay... Hold on...

     MARTIN'S P.O.V.

     through a doorway leading into a den. All that's visible of 
     MR. NEWBERRY, Debi's father, is a pair of legs resting in a 
     Barcolounger.

                      DEBI (V.O.)
          ...Let me get my coat.

                      MARTIN
          I'll just help myself to a cocktail.

     DEBI

     moves up the stairs and disappears.

     MARTIN

     looks at the legs, rolls his shoulders, and heads into the 
     den.

     INT. DEN - CONTINUOUS

     Mr. Newberry sits in the recliner reading a Tom Clancy novel. 
     He is a corporate Aspen-dude-ranch sort with a good head of 
     hair. He sighs, closes the book on his knee and looks up to 
     Martin.

                      MARTIN
          Good evening, Mr. Newberry.

                      MR. NEWBERRY
          Good evening, Mr. Blank.

                      MARTIN
          How are you? How's business?

                      MR. NEWBERRY
          Martin, I don't know where you've 
          been since you abandoned my daughter 
          ten years ago, and I don't care. It 
          was good that you left, and I'm glad 
          you did. So what do you want to talk 
          about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe 
          I had you figured wrong.

                      MARTIN
          How's that?

                      MR. NEWBERRY
          I visualized you, in a haze, as one 
          of the slackster, flannel-wearing, 
          coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been 
          seeing in Newsweek.

                      MARTIN
          I took the other road. I'm more of a 
          self-reflective young lion who does 
          business with lead-pipe cruelty and 
          goes home to drink light beer in 
          milky-eyes isolation. I love sports 
          and sex and have no real relationships 
          with anyone. And you?

                      MR. NEWBERRY
          Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the 
          same old sell-out baby-boomer, 
          exploiting the oppressed I got shot 
          for at Kent State. But why don't we 
          have a drink and forget the whole 
          thing?

     Newberry lays down his book, and moves behind the wet bar.

                      MARTIN
          Why not?

                      MR. NEWBERRY
          So what are you doing with your life 
          now, son?

                      MARTIN
          I'm a professional killer.

                      MR. NEWBERRY
          That's good.

     Debi's footsteps are heard coming down the stairs.

                      DEBI (O.S.)
          Okay

     Mr. Newberry watches Martin turn and walk out of the room.

     EXT. DEBI'S HOUSE

     Martin and Debi pull away from the curb.

     INT. CAR - DUSK

     Martin and Debi drive through that to Debi is town, and to 
     Martin is a widening pool of quicksand.

                      MARTIN
          Do you want to get a drink first?

                      DEBI
          I think they'll probably have booze 
          there.

                      MARTIN
          Right.

     Martin's right hand shakes off of the wheel a bit. He grips 
     it tighter. Suddenly, Martin turns the wheel and pulls into 
     a gas station parking lot, halting next to a pay phone.

                      MARTIN
          I'll just be a second.

     Debi nods, a little confused but going with it.

                      DEBI
          Okay...

     EXT. PAYPHONE - MINUTES LATER

     Martin stands at the kiosk next to the Town Car, mid-
     conversation.

                      MARTIN
               (defensive)
          ...Well, I didn't kill anyone, but 
          someone tried to kill me and the guy 
          in the middle got killed. So if I 
          see that guy again I'm definitely 
          going to kill him, but I won't kill 
          anyone else. Oh, except for the guy 
          I was sent here to kill. I don't 
          know...

     INT. OATMAN'S OFFICE - INTERCUT

     Oatman treats his patient.

                      DR. OATMAN
          What else? Say more.

                      MARTIN
          Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm 
          on my way to the reunion.

     In the background, Lardner and McCullers drive past the 
     station.

                      DR. OATMAN
          Okay. Repeat this after me.

                      MARTIN
          Out Loud?

     Martin looks to Debi. She looks up and smiles. We hear Dr. 
     Oatman's command, Martin mumbles them back.

                      MARTIN
          ...I am at home with the me. I am 
          rooted in me, who is on this 
          adventure.

                      DR. OATMAN
          Take a deep breath and realize, that 
          this is me breathing.

                      MARTIN
          This is me breating.

     Martin takes in a few breaths.

                      MARITN
          Alright, look. I gotta go.

                      DR. OATMAN
          And don't kill anyone.

                      MARTIN
          Right. Don't kill anyone...

     INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - SAME

     Felix rummages delicately around the room. He goes to the

     NIGHTSTAND

     The reunion invite.

     FELIX

     picks it up and scans it.

     EXT. GROSSE POINT HIGH SCHOOL - DUSK

     Lardner and McCullers sit it the parking lot. They watch 
     Martin and Debi pull into a space.

                      LARDNER
          He's falling for her. Look at him.

                      MCCULLERS
          He using her.

                      LARDNER
          You're wrong. Look at his face.

                      MCCULLERS
          One cannot love and kill.

                      LARDNER
               (defensive)
          I love. I kill.

     MARTIN AND DEBI

     climb out of the car. Martin, breathing deeply and wiping 
     his sweaty palms, leans against the car and tries to calm 
     himself. Eighties music echoes from the gym.

                      MARTIN
               (to himself)
          Shoulda brought my gun.

                      DEBI
          What?

     He pulls himself off the car and heads toward

     GROSSE POINTE HIGH SCHOOL

     A sprawling red-brick Gothic structure with many wings. It 
     is topped by church-like towers. It's scary.

     INT. GYM - NIGHT

     Martin and Debi enter and pause to take in the entire scene. 
     A benevolent Ronald Reagan hangs crookedly above. Basketball 
     nets are swung back, draped with crepe. Lights are half-low 
     and the music is loud. Alumni are dancing.

                      ARLENE
          Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott-
          Joseph.

                      MARTIN
          I'm Martin Blank.

                      DEBI
          Debi Newberry.

     Debi heads off into the gym, smiling back as she strands 
     Martin. Arlene rises from a card table. They have little to 
     say. Martin wasn't part of her crowd.

                      ARLENE
          Marty, you haven't changed a bit!

                      MARTIN
          Don't say that.

     Arlene gives him a NAMETAG. As a special torture, the tags 
     have YEARBOOK PHOTOS. Martin looks at the name tag 
     uncomfortably.

                      ARLENE
          We had pictures put on, that way 
          everybody knows who everybody was!

                      MARTIN
          Wonderful.

                      ARLENE
          So, what are you doing now?

                      MARTIN
          Whatever I can get away with.

     She smiles at his joke and is immediately distracted by the 
     next arrival. Martin moves off...

                      ARLENE
               (to the next person)
          Isn't it cute. It's so everybody 
          knows who everybody was!

     He circles the crowded gym. Looking for familiar faces. He 
     stops at the open bar.

                      BATENDER
          What can I make you?

                      MARTIN
          Beer.

     The bartender gets him a beer. Martin recognizes a guy at 
     the bar. He is well-appointed and shiny. He is KEN ALDRIDGE.

                      MARTIN
          Hey, Ken. How have you been?

                      KEN
               (glancing at Martin's 
               name tag)
          Hello Martin. How have you been?

                      MARTIN
          Not bad. You?

     Bob Destephano arrives next to them and orders a drink. Eye 
     contact is made.

                      KEN
          Hello, Bob.

                      MARTIN
          Hey, Bob.

     Bob turns slightly toward them. They continue in their 
     conversation.

                      KEN
          I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice 
          & Fromeyer.

                      MARTIN
          That sounds pretty interesting...

     Bob wants to join the conversation but doesn't know how.

                      KEN
          Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. 
          Some property. Some personal injury.

                      MARTIN
          Those all seem kind of related...

     Bob takes another drink and mopes off, Martin watches him 
     go.

                      MARTIN
          Tragedy makes you thirsty.

     Ken chuckles. The bartender arrives with the bottle. Martin 
     grabs it and begins to move off.

                      MARTIN
          Well... I have to take this over to 
          Debi.

                      KEN
          Here. Take my card. Wait a minute... 
          here's a special one. For top-shelf 
          clients.

     Ken hands Martin a Monte Blanc pen with Ken's title and 
     business address printed on the shaft. Martin reads it and 
     puts it in his kerchief pocket.

                      MARTIN
          Thanks.

     Ken goes back to listening to the Guys at the bar.

     MARTIN

     makes his way through the upbeat crowd of well-wishers. TERRY 
     emerges like an inkspot on a clean white whirt, and intercepts 
     Martin. His angst is barely under control as he sidles up to 
     Martin.

                      TERRY
          I don't know, Blank, all these fucking 
          people, driving me crazy. Look at 
          them over there, memorializing old 
          times, acting all like it was 
          something "life-changing." And the 
          people in the National Honor Society? 
          The name tags?

     Martin shrugs.

                      TERRY
          They have special blue starts on 
          them like it fucking matters now 
          that they were in the honor club ten 
          years ago. I'm getting fucking 
          nauseous from all this sentimental 
          bullshit. It's making me sick.

     Terry stops suddenly as if he's finished. Martin reads this 
     man's nametag.

                      MARTIN
          Why are you here... Terry?

     Terry turns on a dime.

                      TERRY
          I wanted to see a couple people. But 
          I don't want to talk about the old 
          days... What did we have together, 
          Martin? Typing?

                      MARTIN
               (remembering)
          Drafting.

                      TERRY
          Yeah, I couldn't stand that fucking 
          class. But I appreciate you helping 
          me out, man.

                      MARTIN
          Don't mention it.

                      TERRY
          Yeah, thanks. Well I'm going to try 
          and get out of here, man. I'll see 
          you later.

     Terry slinks off.

     BAR - SAME

     Bob Destephano grabs two more scotches off the bar and turns 
     to leave, thoroughly morose. In his path, he finds DAN 
     KORETZKY, the good-looking side of brainy.

                      DAN
          Bob. Bob Destephano.

                      BOB
          What?

                      DAN
          I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.

                      BOB
          Computer guy.

                      DAN
          Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's 
          dealership the other day.

                      BOB
          I sell BMW's. What do you do?

                      DAN
          Not much, actually. My software 
          company just went public so I'm 
          just... hanging out, really.

     There's a sudden lull in the conversation. Bob tries his 
     drunken hand at relating...

                      BOB
          Remember high school?

                      DAN
          Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us 
          up in the grandstands?

     Dan points up to a group of happy, laughing people. Bob walks 
     off shaking his head and smiling bitterly.

     INT. GYM - LATER

     Debi and Martin are seated at a round table with six others 
     in an area blocked off for dinner. Plates of gumbo are 
     arriving and the wine is poured. DARIUS, an African-American, 
     is in mid-conversation with AMY, who looks like she walked 
     out of a Laura Ashley catalog and sits on the other side of 
     Martin. DENNIS and MIKE are two suits in the midst of a non-
     stop sports conversation.

                      MIKE
          ...You gotta hold the fans 
          responsible, though, Dennis, because 
          they're the ones putting up with the 
          mediocre product.

                      DENNIS
          I guess, though, you know, if you 
          look at it Mike, that park is a 
          beautiful park, I've gone to that 
          park many times - I've had the 
          greatest time of my life at that 
          ballpark and let's face it, I tell 
          you this, Mike, by the sixth inning, 
          if you're having the fun you should 
          be having at Tigers Stadium, you 
          don't even know what the hell's going 
          on anyway...

     They both crack up at this.

     ANGLE ON DARIUS, MARTIN, & DEBI

                      DARIUS
          Have you two been together since 
          high school?

                      DEBI
          No--

                      MARTIN
          --Yes. Actually we just bought that 
          little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine 
          Avenue... Debi's a social worker and 
          I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--

                      DEBI
          We haven't seen each other since 
          high school.

                      DARIUS
          I figured. You two look too happy 
          together. I shouldn't say that though, 
          I'm married... So, Martin-- what are 
          you up to these days? What do you do 
          for a living?

     Debi perks up; this should be interesting.

                      MARTIN
          I'm in pro-active international 
          relations. It's a very specialized 
          company. We execute economic 
          investment opportunities. Sort of 
          economic clean-up... with an emphasis 
          on personnel. It's boring, you know, 
          it's boring. I don't like to talk 
          about it because I don't think what 
          a man does necessarily reflects who 
          he is...

     Martin begins to draw strange looks from all over the table. 
     Martin may be in trouble.

                      MARTIN
          ...I've always tried to refrain from 
          a black-and-white moral lexicon--you 
          know, good, bad, right, wrong--I've 
          been more interested in the gray 
          areas.

     Silence. Martin pushes on.

                      MARTIN
          But that's no way to live. I guess 
          you've got to just take the leap of 
          faith. Believe in something. Fuck 
          it.

                      DARIUS
          Sounds complicated, Martin. Are you 
          happy?

                      MARTIN
          I just have to close this one last 
          account. I'd like to just stop now, 
          today, but I can't... It's a step in 
          the right direction.

                      DEBI
          I don't know, Martin. It sounds like 
          you're feeling compromised. Live the 
          way you want. The only thing that's 
          inexcusable, to me, is cynicism. 
          That's the biggest cop-out there is.

     Nods of assent come from around the table. A brief silence, 
     and then...

                      AMY
          But wait. I still don't understand 
          what you do.

                      MARTIN
          I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.

     Debi suppresses a laugh.

                      AMY
          You do not.

                      MARTIN
          Yes I do.

                      AMY
          You don't...

                      MARTIN
          In the corporate offices.

                      AMY
          Oh... really?

                      MARTIN
          Yeah...

                      AMY
          What do you do?

                      MARTIN
          I sell biscuits to the Southland.

                      AMY
          You do not.

                      MARTIN
          It's what I do.

                      AMY
          You're so funny...

                      MARTIN
          I sell biscuits and gravy all over 
          the Southland--

                      AMY
          --Stop it--

                      MARTIN
          You know those horsey biscuit gravy 
          packets? I move all of those--

                      AMY
          --No.

                      MARTIN
          Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's 
          and just change them to special 
          barbecue sauce.

     Across the table from Martin and Debi, Dennis turns to Darius.

                      DENNIS
          What do you think about black coaching 
          in the NFL, Darius? Because I think 
          it's great.

                      DARIUS
          I don't pay much attention to 
          football.

                      MIKE
          I have to agree with you Dennis. 
          It's good to see that the owners are 
          willing to put the franchise behind 
          a black head coach or QB when for 
          years in the league they've been 
          kept out of the thinking positions 
          and relegated mainly to the physical 
          game.

                      DENNIS
          But now, you see, you have Warren 
          Moon at the helm, Cunningham, Art 
          Shell, and the coach up at 
          Minnesota...

                      MIKE
          Dennis Green. And if you remember, 
          Doug Williams was the first black 
          man to prove that on a Superbowl 
          Sunday.

     Amy leans in to Martin.

                      AMY
               (to Martin)
          I'm teaching art at Cedar Junior 
          High School.

                      DENNIS
          ...Yeah, listen. Where do you stand 
          on this whole Louis Farrakhan 
          issue...?

                      DARIUS
               (facetious)
          I'm a De Klerk man myself.

     Debi nods, indicating to the deejay stand.

                      DEBI
          I'm going over to play some tunes.

     Martin watches her walk away.

     INT. GYM - GRANDSTANDS - LATER

     Dan Koretzky sits with two other FORMER-SQUARES-turned-
     handsome-fellas who now enjoy a confidence that comes with 
     early investment in Microsoft.

     Martin looks out over the milieu below, enjoying the seene. 
     He eavesdrops on a group of men from a few rows back.

     GROUP OF MEN

                      DAN
          Look at her. There it is. Jenny 
          Slater. The finest thing that ever 
          walked these halls.

                      FORMER-SQUARE #2
          I believe she married the state of 
          Maine.

                      DAN
          Yeah, he's around here somewhere. 
          What a shame. She would have looked 
          great in my fucking Bentley.

                      FORMER-SQUARE #3
          No, my friends, Jenny Beam. Not only 
          was she as fine, if not finer, than 
          Slater, but she had the "bad girl" 
          thing going for her. And the red 
          hair. C'mon.

                      DAN
          She's a paramedic in Skokie, Illinois.

                      FORMER-SQUARE #2
          You both are mistaken. Jenny Maretti 
          was the finest. No question about 
          it.

                      FORMER-SQUARE #3
          The three Jenny's. Three Jenny's. 
          All named Jenny...

                      DAN
          You know what I'm really hoping? 
          That Jenny Slater gets divorced. And 
          she's twenty-eight--

                      FORMER-SQUARE #3
          --she's got half the state of Maine--

                      DAN
          She's twenty-eight years old, with 
          two kids, she's still really really 
          fine, and I see her at a bookstore 
          or something, and she sees me for 
          what I was then, and what I am now: 
          the redemption for all her failure.

                      FORMER-SQUARE #3
          You mean the redemption for all your 
          failure.

     They ponder this. Martin looks down on the gym, concentrating 
     on Debi.

     BOB DESTEPHANO

     Dancing drunkenly, miserable, like an unbalanced orangutan.

                                           CUT TO:

     INT. GYM - DEEJAY BOOTH - LATER

     Martin stands by Debi as she sits in for a set in the deejay 
     booth, on a raised stage. They are playing an old sophomoric 
     game.

                      DEBI
          Which would you rather...?

                      MARTIN
          Okay... Would you rather... commit 
          yourself sexually to a four-by-nine 
          cell with former President George 
          Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a 
          super-model for a month, or make 
          love to a otter on crank for a week?

                      DEBI
          Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, 
          clearly! I'd let the little beast 
          scratch and claw all he wants... 
          Okay. Would you rather make love to 
          the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--

                      MARTIN
          --She's not dead---

                      DEBI
          It's just a game...! Alright. Candied 
          Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest 
          across the desert with a fully 
          digested crab apple in your mouth?

                      MARTIN
          Wow. I have to give this some thought.

                      DEBI
          No time.

                      MARTIN
          Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.

     STACEY breaks the moment, looking up at the two, horrified 
     and unsure at what she's heard.

                      STACEY
          Marty! Debi! How are you! So many 
          people came, but I never expected to 
          see you Marty. Or you Debi... I 
          mean... because of what your 
          divorce... I didn't mean to say that. 
          I just meant you look so good.

                      DEBI
          Thank you.

                      STACEY
          Do you think you could play "Too 
          Shy'" by Kaja Goo Goo?

                      DEBI
          Stacey, why don't you come up here 
          and take over for a little while?

                      STACEY
          I'd love to.

     Stacey nods thanks and makes her way up into the booth as 
     Martin and Debi make their way down.

                      DEBI
               (to Martin)
          Everybody thinks they know me now 
          that I'm divorced.

     She leads Martin toward the exit.

                      DEBI
          It's time to see you in private.

     INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY

     Martin and Debi walk down the hallway, alone together.

                      MARTIN
          Even though I left, you never left 
          me. Not just memory but a substance 
          in my blood.

                      DEBI
               (smiling)
          Like heroin?

                      MARTIN
          Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.

                      DEBI
               (enjoying this)
          Like love?

                      MARTIN
          Could be. The physical substance of 
          love.

     Debi stops.

                      DEBI
          I'll accept that. Follow me.

     Together they move into what appears to be the Nurse's Office, 
     and close the door behind them.

     INT. NURSE'S OFFICE

     Martin and Debi make wild banshee love.

     EXT. PARKING LOT - SAME

     Lardner and McCullers watch Felix into the gym.

                      MCCULLERS
          Looks like someone keeps trying to 
          do our job for us.

                      LARDNER
          If he does our job, he's our job.

                      MCCULLERS
          I get it.

     INT. GYM - SAME

     FELIX

     steps through the doorway he's standing in and strolls into 
     the crowded gym. He wears the standard khaki-pants-blue-blazer 
     combo, with no nametag. He's clearly too old for the class 
     of 1984.

     INT. HALLWAY - LATER

     Martin and Debi come out of the Nurse's Office. The post-
     coital mood is broken as they hear The Human League's "Don't 
     You Want Me, Baby?"  blasting from the gym. Martin and Debi 
     tune in on the song for a moment, unhappy at remembering 
     that particular moment in pop music history. Debi looks to 
     Martin, something must be done about it.

                      DEBI
          I'll be right back....

     Debi kisses him. They split up. Martin walks off, the happiest 
     we've seen him....

     INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY

     Bob and several others from the muscle-to-fat crew play a 
     drunken scrimmage with a papier-mache table ornament footbal 
     that is coming unwound. Bob quarterbacks and begins to recite 
     a long, complicated, and forgotten play. Martin approaches 
     from behind Bob and glides through the ad-hoc line-up, 
     continuing down the hall. Bob yells "hike" as he stares after 
     Martin, distracted. Bob's rushed upon and sacked. He lets 
     the papier-mache ball drop and crack on the floor.

     INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER

     Martin walks down a silent, deserted hall of lockers and 
     classroom doors. The only sounds are his footsteps and the 
     echoed strains of Iggy Pop's "Wild Child" from the distant 
     gym. He stops at locker number 1963 and flips the dial: Right-
     back left-right again. It opens. He pops up the steel false 
     ceiling in the empty locker, fishes his hand in the opening, 
     and withdraws what he is looking for: an ancient joint. He 
     holds it up and examines the now brown and dried reefer. He 
     grinds it into dust in his hand.

     INT. HALLWAY

     Debi comes out of the gym and starts down the hall, the music 
     changed for the better.

     INT. HALLWAY - SAME

     Martin senses he is not alone. He turns to find Bob 
     Destephano. The big man holds a glass unsteadily and slurs 
     slightly when he speaks. Bob is looking sad and scary. He 
     leans into Martin

                      BOB
          So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that 
          shit again?

                      MARTIN
          Fine, Bob. How are you?

                      BOB
          Never better.

                      MARTIN
          Really?

     Bob crumbles.

                      BOB
          Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing 
          adds up to nothing... you work your 
          whole life, day in and day out-- try 
          to make sense of it all. One day 
          you're twenty-seven and what do you 
          get to show for it...

                      MARTIN
          You could've been a contender, huh?

     Bob realizes he can't even express his own tragedy without 
     the use of cliches.

                      BOB
          Smart boy. Real smart. Let's see how 
          smart you are with my foot up your 
          ass! I'm gonna kick your ass!

     Martin steps to Bob.

                      MARTIN
          Why would you want to hit me, Bob? 
          Do you really believe that there's 
          some stored up conflict that needs 
          resolution between us? We don't exist. 
          There's nothing between us. So who 
          do you want to hit, Bob? It's not 
          me.

     Bob slumps against the lockers, deflated.

                      BOB
          What am I gonna do?

                      MARTIN
          What do you want to do?

                      BOB
          I want to be an actor.

                      MARTIN
          Then express yourself, Bob.

     Bob frowns, trying to think of a way to express himself.

                      MARTIN
               (catching him)
          Be honest...

     Bob backs up and lets out a huge, drunken caveman scream, 
     then stops abruptly, and smiles.

                      BOB
          Later, Martin.

     Bob backpedals down the hallway and out of sight. Martin 
     watches him stumble out of the hallway and bang through the 
     doors of a stairwell, disappearing.

     INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

     Bob slams through the doors and begins to stumble down the 
     stairs. He encounters Debi, on her way up. He glances at her 
     but does not break stride. Debi gives him wide berth, and 
     quickens her pace up the stairs...

     INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

     Martin watches the doors swing to a stop. He exhales and 
     relaxes... AND THEN Spin-pivots on his right heel, as a BURST 
     from a silenced pistol pierces the space where his head was 
     a split-second before/ As he spins around, his right hand 
     withdraws Ken's give-away pen from his kerchief pocket, pops 
     the cap off, and drive the pen up and through the throat of 
     his attacker--

     FELIX

     impaled through the throat on the pen, his head snapped back.

     MARTIN AND FELIX

     are frozen for a moment. Blood runs quickly down the front 
     of Felix's body, off of his shoes, and on to the floor. The 
     stairwell doors band open. Martin's head turns toward the 
     sound. His eyes lock onto

     DEBI

     who is frozen, horrified for a moment. She flees.

     MARTIN

     looks back at

     FELIX

     Dead.

     THE FLOOR

     A growing pool of blood.

     MARTIN

     Looks around wildly, holding Felix up against the lockers. 
     Above the lockers is a plastic banner proclaiming

           "SPANISH CLUB FIESTA FUN-RAISER SATURDAY JUNE 1"

     MARTIN

     rips it down from the wall with his free hand, wraps it around 
     Felix, stuffs the body into his open locker, and slams it 
     shut. He pulls off his shoes and socks, puts a sock over 
     each hand like mittens, and wipes up the small pool of blood. 
     He stuffs the socks into his pockets, takes off down the 
     hall, and bangs through the doors.

     INT. GYM - GRANDSTANDS - MOMENTS LATER

     Martin blasts through the upstairs doors to the grandstands 
     looking for Debi below. She is nowhere to be found. He scans 
     the party in progress-- It is the same frame of image as the 
     one in Oatman's office. In the middle of the floor, Terry 
     slowly turns up to meet Martin's eyes.

     MARTIN

     pulls the doors shut, and takes off down the hall.

     INT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

     Martin opens his locker, withdraws the corpse, and hefts it 
     over his shoulder.

     INT. STAIRWELL - A MINUTE LATER

     Brick-walled, darkly lit, and narrow. Martin bounds down the 
     steep steps with his load.

     INT. BASEMENT LOCKER ROOM HALLWAY - MINUTE LATER

     Martin hustles toward a cage door in front of him. He kicks 
     through it and dumps Felix into a canvas laundry cart on 
     casters and begins rolling.

     INT. PUMP AND FURNACE ROOM - A MINUTE LATER

     The door bangs open and light pours into the room from behind 
     Martin. He negotiates the cart over the dirt floor and stops 
     next to the furnace that heats the swimming pool. He pauses 
     and looks to the ceiling: the music from the reunion pulses 
     into the floor above him. Martin picks up a large metal bar 
     and works open the door on the hulking cast-iron furnace. A 
     white-hot blaze roars within.

     INT. GYM - NIGHT

     The party is winding down. A harried-looking Martin walks in 
     and looks around once more for Debi-- nothing.

     MARTIN'S POV

     of the Deejay booth. It is empty.

     He moves over to the bar and joins Ken Aldridge. He motions 
     to the bartender who opens a beer for him.

                      MARTIN
          Have you seen Debi Newberry?

                      KEN
          Nope.

     They both look around at the last of the reunion.

                      KEN
          The more things change, the more 
          they Goddamned well stay the same.

                      MARTIN
          I guess.

     Before Ken can get started again...

                      MARTIN
          Take care of yourself, Ken. Thanks 
          for the pen.

     Martin walks out of the gym.

     EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

     Paul is leaning against his Beemer, having a smoke.

                      PAUL
          What the hell happened to you?

                      MARTIN
          I was catching up with Bob Destephano.

                      PAUL
          As long as you had a good time.

     Beat. Martin scans the lot for sign of Debi.

                      PAUL
          What now? Chase the girl?

     There is a beat of silence. Nothing seems worth saying.

                      MARTIN
          It didn't work out.

                      PAUL
          That's too bad.

                      MARTIN
          I have to get my head back into my 
          work.

                      PAUL
          Work's good for the soul.

     Martin gets up to leave.

                      MARTIN
          When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.

                      PAUL
          See you in ten years.

     Paul watches him leave. He almost stops him, but thinks better 
     of it.

     INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - NIGHT

     Martin hunches over his briefcase that lays open on the bed.

     MARTIN PULLS

     THE DOSSIER from the briefcase. It's seal is broken, but the 
     contents remain enclosed... He withdraws the package and 
     dumps the contents on the bed. His face registers muted shock.

                      MARTIN
          Dumb fucking luck...

     THE CONTENTS

     include various photos of MR. NEWBERRY, Mr. Newberry with 
     Debi, and the house. The photos are mingled with official-
     looking papers including credit reports, medical records, 
     etc... Newberry's life.

     He cocks his head toward the door anticipating a... KNOCK. 
     He freezes, then plucks a gun tapped under a desk, and moves 
     toward the door, pointing. Halfway to the door, his face and 
     body slacken. He lobs the gun onto the bed. With everything 
     gone wrong, there is nothing left to defend. He goes to the 
     door and opens it, body relaxed, expecting a bullet...

     Debi moves past him into the room. She is completely calm.

                      DEBI
          He was trying to kill you, right!

                      MARTIN
          Yes.

                      DEBI
          Not the other way around...?

                      MARTIN
          No.

                      DEBI
          Is it something you've done?

                      MARTIN
          It's something I do...

     Beat.

                      MARTIN
          ...Professionally...

     Beat.

                      MARTIN
          ...About five years now.

                      DEBI
               (stunned)
          Get the fuck outta here.

                      MARTIN
          Seriously, when I left, I joined the 
          Army and took the service exam. They 
          found my psych results fit a certain 
          profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" 
          would be the best way to describe 
          it... I was loaned out to a CIA-
          sponsored program. It's called 
          "mechanical operations." We sort of 
          found each other...

                      DEBI
          You're a government spook?

     Martin says nothing.

                      MARTIN
          I was, but no... yes... I was before, 
          but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, 
          really. The idea of governments, 
          nations, it's mostly a public 
          relations theory at this point, 
          anyway. But I'll tell you something, 
          until about five months ago, I really 
          enjoyed my work.

                      DEBI
          Jesus Christ!

                      MARTIN
          Then I started losing my taste for 
          it. Which usually means your time is 
          up. But then I realized it was 
          something entirely different... I 
          started getting the sneaking, dark 
          suspicion that maybe there was... 
          meaning to life.

                      DEBI
          Okay. Great, Martin, that's just 
          great. Meaning to life... Mmm....

                      MARTIN
          Like, that there's a point? An organic 
          connection between all living things.

                      DEBI
          Let me help you along, Martin. You're 
          a sociopath!

                      MARTIN
               (defensive)
          A sociopath kills for no reason. I 
          kill for money.

                      DEBI
          You never could have kept this from 
          me.

                      MARTIN
          I was leaving.

                      DEBI
          That's probably a good idea.

                      MARTIN
          Will you come with me?

                      DEBI
          I'm staying here.

                      MARTIN
          What if I come back?

                      DEBI
          I'll hide.

     She goes for the door.

                      MARTIN
          Don't go.

     She stops at the door. Slowly, she turns.

                      DEBI
          You don't get to have me. You are a 
          monster, I'm a human being. We're 
          not going to mate.

                      MARTIN
          You don't understand...

                      DEBI
          That's because I speak human, and 
          you speak monster.

     Debi bolts out of the room. Martin is left alone.

     Martin looks over at his gear on the bed. After a beat, he 
     walks slowly over and surveys his tools. He picks up a 
     cleaning rag and begins to go over the weapons, absently 
     singing to himself...

                      MARTIN
          "What's up Doc? What's cookin'? What's 
          up Doc, are you lookin'...?

     INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - DAWN

     Morning light comes through the slit in the curtains, picking 
     up four or five exquisitely clean guns are laid out on the 
     bed, almost geometrically spaced. Martin lifts one at a time, 
     checking their bores and actions...

     INT. COUNTRY SQUIRE - MORNING

     Lardner and McCullers gear up. They each finish loading the 
     last of many clips...

     EXT. MICHIGAN HIGHWAY - MORNING

     Grocer and Company, not in a Ford Passenger Van, veer off 
     onto an exit ramp. Grocer has assembled a team of about nine. 
     They draw different guns from their kit bags and begin 
     loading...

     INT. COUNTRY SQUIRE - SAME

     Lardner and McCullers jam clips into their service autos and 
     knock the slides...

     INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - SAME

     Martin finished loading his guns, and puts them in his case. 
     He shuts it and moves for the door. On the way out he stops 
     and looks himself in the mirror before exiting.

     EXT. THREE DIFFERENT ROADS - INTERCUT

     Each car whooshes by camera, on its way to the inevitable...

     INT. EASTWEST HOLDING COMPANY - INTERCUT

     Marcella has a cordless tucked between her shoulder and ear, 
     and holds a two-gallon gas can. She moves from room to room 
     pouring gasoline onto the computers, desks, and piles of 
     paper stacked on the floor. She adds a splash to her copy of 
     "Women Who Run With the Wolves."

                      MARCELLA
          I'm bringing down the office now.

     She picks up her hard drive and smashes it on the floor. 
     It's cathartic.

     INTERCUT WITH MARTIN IN THE TOWN CAR -

                      MARTIN
          I'll put things right. Then I'll 
          find you.

     Silence on the line.

                      MARCELLA
               (apprehensive)
          Uh... why?

     Martin finishes his weapons check, and pulls out the dossier.

                      MARTIN
          Don't worry. I left you a little 
          something under your desk.

     Martin hangs up.

     Marcella goes to it and pulls loose from underneath a shrink-
     wrapped brick of $100 bills, probably a $100,000 or so.

                      MARCELLA
          All right!!

     INT. MARTIN'S TOWN CAR

     Martin makes his way down the road to the Newberry's. In the 
     distance, he sees a lone figure jogging on the shoulder, 
     away from him.

     INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME

     Grocer and Company are parked off to the side, watching 
     Newberry, in the distance, jog toward them. A SNIPER prepares 
     to blow Newberry's head off.

     INT. MARTIN'S TOWN CAR - SAME

     As he approaches the figure, he recognizes it as Newberry, 
     he accelerates.

     INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME

     Grocer spots Martin's car speeding at Newberry.

                      GROCER
          Oh shit...

     EXT. ROAD - SAME

     Newberry stops jogging and turns to face the Town Car bearing 
     down on him. His face goes slack, expecting to be creamed.

     INT. TOWN CAR - SAME

     Martin roars straight at Newberry, his engine shrieking. As 
     the distance between them turns from yards to feet... Martin 
     swerves hard, just missing Newberry and comes to a halt next 
     to him, blocking the Sniper's line of fire. After a moment, 
     Newberry opens the passenger door.

                      NEWBERRY
          What the fuck is the matter with 
          you?!

                      MARTIN
          Well, I was hired to kill you. It's 
          what I do, and come to think of it, 
          I told you that, but... Okay. I'm 
          not going to do it. Get in the car.

     He does. They drive on.

                      MARTIN
          It's either because I'm in love with 
          your daughter, or because I have a 
          new-found respect for life. Or both. 
          But I don't know.

     INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME

     Grocer and company watch in amazement.

     GROCER'S P.O.V.

     of Martin's car disappearing into Newberry's long and wooded 
     driveway.

                      GROCER
          That punk is either in love with 
          that guy's daughter or he has new 
          found respect for life... Let's go.

     EXT. NEWBERRY HOUSE - SAME

     Martin pulls up in front and stops. Both men scramble out 
     and head toward the front door at a quick clip. Newberry is 
     shaken; Martin seems at ease, at home in his element.

                      NEWBERRY
          Why? I build cars! They're paying 
          you to kill me? Why?

                      MARTIN
          It was a cost-cutting effort. They 
          can't afford a recall.

                      NEWBERRY
          It was a leaky sunroof! A design 
          flaw! I reported a leaky sunroof! 
          You want to kill me because of that?

                      MARTIN
          It's not me! Why does everybody think 
          it's personal?!

     They go through the front door and shut it behind them.

     INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME

     Grocer drops the van into gear and heads toward the driveway.

     INT. COUNTRY SQUIRE - SAME

     Lardner and McCullers approach the scene. They get within 
     viewing distance in time to see Grocer's Town Car turn into 
     the driveway.

                      LARDNER
          We'll go in through the woods.

     INT. NEWBERRY HOUSE

     Martin's briefcase is open on the large oak table. The 
     contents of the dossier are spilled out onto the table. 
     Newberry and Debi watch him, dumbstruck, as he draws a huge 
     Desert Eagle automatic and jerks back the slide. He turns to 
     Debi.

                      MARTIN
          I was sitting in my house on prom 
          night wearing that Goddamned rented 
          tuxedo, a corsage in one hand, a 
          bottle of champagne in the other. So 
          I was just sitting there, and then 
          the whole night flashed before my 
          eyes, and it struck me like a bullet 
          in the head-- I realized, finally, 
          and for the first time, that... I 
          wanted to kill somebody. So I figured 
          because I loved you so much, that'd 
          it'd be a good idea if I didn't see 
          you anymore. But now I'm different.

     He turns and points the gun at the front door and FIRES two 
     shots through it, leaving two baseball-size holes in the 
     door.

     Martin bolts out of the room toward the back of the house. 
     Debi and Newberry run as fast as they can away from Martin. 
     Newberry opens the front door, preparing to rush out with 
     Debi. They stop at what they see:

     NEWBERRY'S & DEBI'S P.O.V.

     As ASSASSIN lies on the porch, shot dead through the door by 
     Martin. IN one hand is a gun, in the other is a Fuller Brush 
     kit. Two men, GROCER and an ASSASSIN, clamber out of van, 
     their guns rising up fast toward us.

     Debi pulls Newberry inside, slams the front door, and locks 
     it. They dive away just before ten rounds hit the door from 
     outside.

     INT. KITCHEN - SAME

     Martin rushes toward the back door which is already opening. 
     A barrel comes through and FIRES at Martin. Martin pulls 
     back behind the refrigerator and returns FIRE. An ASSASSIN 
     comes through the door in a crouch and takes cover behind 
     the cooking island. Martin, yelling back to Debi...

                      MARTIN
          I'm in love with you. I know we can 
          make this work!

     MARTIN

     rushes toward the island, grabbing an iron skillet off the 
     range, and holds it up like a crossing-guard stop sign. He 
     steps toward the hidden Assassin just as the Assassin rises 
     SHOOTING. The skillet takes two rounds before Martin hammers 
     the Assassin's head with it. Debi and Newberry arrive in the 
     kitchen.

     NEW ANGLE - LOW DUTCH

     Martin bashes the skillet into the Assassin's skull, which 
     is beyond our view. He rises spattered with blood and looks 
     at Debi.

                      MARTIN
          I was afraid to commit to a 
          relationship, but now I know I'm 
          ready to make it happen.

     Martin drops the skillet and grabs Newberry and Debi gently 
     be the wrists.

                      MARTIN
          I just need time to change.

     He ushers them past the bludgeoned corpse and up the back 
     stairs. He spins and FIRES twice back down the stairs at 
     another ASSASSIN coming up, blowing his arms off.

     HALLWAY

     He leads them quickly.

                      MARTIN
          It's not easy for me. I was raised 
          to close off, to control my 
          feelings...

     He takes them into a bedroom, and BLOWS AWAY, an ASSASSIN 
     coming in through the window, emptying his auto. Martin pushes 
     Debi and Newberry into an adjoining bathroom. He backs out 
     through the doorway.

                      MARTIN
          Lock the door.

     They do. Martin starts away, but stops to get something 
     straight.

                      MARTIN
          I wasn't raised in a loving 
          environment.
               (beat)
          But that's not an excuse. It's a 
          reason.

     INT. FOYER

     Martin corners the banister and springs half-way down the 
     stairs, then hears the front door begin to open.

                      MARTIN
          My soul was empty--

     Martin jams in another clip, and chambers a round. He sees 
     Grocer beginning to slip in.

                      MARTIN
          --and it's up to me to fill it.

     Martin FIRES the twelve-round clip into the door until the 
     slide locks back empty again. Grocer backs out fast. Martin 
     hears a gun REPORT from upstairs and moves back toward it, 
     tossing the spent weapon.

     INT. BEDROOM

     An ASSASSIN slams his body against the bathroom door while 
     Debi and Newberry scream from within. Martin flies at him. 
     The Assassin wheels on Martin FIRING. Martin pivots out of 
     the line of fire, still moving forward. He takes hold of 
     Assassin's neck and snaps it. Martin drops the corpse.

                      MARTIN
               (through the door)
          It's okay. It's Martin The door begins 
          to open revealing Debi and Newberry.

                      MARTIN
          I know what I do isn't moral, per 
          se, but if you could just look past 
          that, you'd see a man worth loving.

                      GROCER (O.S.)
          Don't listen to him, he's a 
          professional.

     Martin stops short and cocks his head toward Grocer's muffled 
     voice coming from the vent. Grocer continues...

                      GROCER (O.S.)
          You're breaking my heart down here, 
          Blank. I can't shoot through the 
          tears.

     Martin, incensed, bends down and takes the gun from the dead 
     man. He runs out of the bedroom, gun poised for a kamikaze 
     firefight...

     EXT. NEWBERRY HOUSE - SAME

     Lardner and McCullers are poised outside the front door, 
     about to enter the mix. McCullers peers through the window.

                      LARDNER
          Did you see Blank in there?

                      MCCULLERS
          No...

                      LARDNER
          Good. For a second there I thought 
          we were in trouble.

     INT. NEWBERRY FOYER - CONTINUOUS

     MARTIN

     reaches the top of the front stairs to find Grocer heading 
     up the stairs at him. They lift their guns at each other to 
     FIRE, when they hear...

     LARDNER AND MCCULLERS

     power through the front door, guns BLAZING at floor-level, 
     ala Butch and Sundance.

     Martin and Grocer, above, spin on them instinctively, and 
     FIRE, killing them. Grocer dives off of the stairs and rolls 
     out of view.

     KITCHEN - INTERCUT

     GROCER

     heads up the back stairs.

     MARTIN

     works his way toward Grocer, moving with stealth toward the 
     kitchen.

     GROCER

     hears him and starts back down.

     Martin dives behind the cooking island just as Grocer comes 
     out of the stairwell blasting. They unload at each other as 
     Grocer runs a pattern across the kitchen, FIRING at Martin, 
     crouched, who BLASTS back. Grocer vaults himself through the 
     air toward a serving window from the kitchen to the dining 
     room, still firing.

     C.U. - MARTIN'S GUN - SLOW MOTION

     The last casing floats out of the chamber into the air, and 
     the slide on the auto locks back-- empty.

     NORMAL SPEED

     GROCER

     Flying through the air disappearing through the shuttered 
     serving window, his flight carrying him past a television 
     that sits on a lazy susan.

     MARTIN AND GROCER - INTERCUT

     Martin and Grocer sit on the floor, backs up against opposite 
     side of the counter-- Martin in the kitchen and Grocer in 
     the dining room. The hulking old television sits on the 
     counter above and between them.

     Martin looks up and spies the TELEVISION

                      GROCER
          ...How about I sell you two rounds 
          for a hundred grand a piece?

                      MARTIN
          Okay.

     Martin takes out a checkbook, and tears one free. He wads it 
     into a loose ball and tosses it over the counter.

     BALLED CHECK

     sails over the television and comes down, bouncing off 
     Grocer's head and into his lap.

                      MARTIN
          There you go. I left it blank.

                      GROCER
          Excellent. Here they come.

     Grocer pulls two rounds from the clip of his semi-automatic 
     and pushes the clip back into the gun. Grocer arcs the TWO 
     BULLETS into the air.

     MARTIN

     rises and springs at the television, gripping it. The TWO 
     BULLETS sail past his head.

     GROCER

     begins to rise from his side of the counter, cocking his 
     gun.

     MARTIN

     puts all his weight and motion behind the television. Martin 
     and the television careen off of the counter toward Grocer.

     GROCER

     gets off one round before

     MARTIN

     flies onto Grocer, smashing the seventy-five pound television 
     over his Goddamn head. Martin sails past the collision, 
     landing on his back in the dining room. He rolls over to see

     GROCER

     Body crumpled, neck is snapped, head encased in the shattered 
     picture tube. He is dead.

     MARTIN

     runs up the front stairs, retrieving the spent gun he 
     discarded earlier, and heads into the bedroom.

     INT. BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

     Martin opens the bathroom door. Inside, Debi sits on the 
     edge of the tub, her face in her hands. Newberry kneels with 
     his arms around her. Martin takes this in, and walks back 
     into the bedroom. Newberry stands and follows him out.

     MARTIN AND NEWBERRY

     MARTIN a bloody, tattered mess, wipes off the gun and puts 
     it into Newberry's hand. Newberry, in total shock, grips it. 
     Martin looks past Newberry.

     MARTIN'S P.O.V.

     Of Debi, head in hands.

                      MARTIN (V.O.)
          Debi... will you marry me?

     Debi doesn't look up. After a moment, she reaches out, head 
     still down, and closes the bathroom door...

     INT. RADIO STATION - DAY

     Outside is a Michigan autumn. Debi sits at her console, 
     bringing in the mike as she fades out of a tune...

                      DEBI
          This is WRFN Radio Free Newberry 
          cause that's what it does. Bringing 
          you New Ones for the Nineties, a 
          fresh new format designed to pull 
          you out of what's come before, and 
          reel you into what's coming soon--

     THE PHONE CONSOLE

     lights up with an incoming cal...

                      DEBI
          I tell you what's coming soon for 
          me, or at least what I dreamed this 
          morning in that weird time just before 
          you actually wake up. But first this 
          commercial. Back after this...

     She pushes a couple of buttons, slaps a cartridge in a player, 
     and answers the phone. We hear the commercial over the studio 
     monitor:

                      ANNOUNCER
          Don't miss the show of the season at 
          Bilkin Community Center! "Brigadoon!" 
          A musical for all ages! "Brigadoon," 
          starring Carol Plummer, Thomas 
          Canchola, Bob Destephano, and Lee 
          Ordman!...

     Debi picks up the phone.

                      DEBI
          RFN...

     Her face goes slack as she listens... not good, not bad... 
     Then she hangs up slowly. The commercial ends. A moment of 
     dead air, then she snaps to.

                      DEBI
          Hey out there... Okay... I'm going 
          to finish up that fantasy later. 
          First I'll give you an hour of nonstop 
          music... If I don't come back on 
          after that-- well, nevermind.

     Debi turns on a reel-to-reel, and leaves.

     EXT. FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT HOUSE - DAY

     Debi pulls up and gets out. She begins toward the door but 
     stops dead when she sees

     MARTIN

     sitting on the front steps.

     Debi moves slowly up the walk and sits next to him on the 
     porch. They sit, gazing out over the grass and trees beyond. 
     After a while...

                      DEBI
          This will never work out.

     She turns to him, serious.

                      DEBI
          You kill people.
               (beat)

                      MARTIN
          I have no illusions about the future. 
          What is, is. We make choices. And we 
          become the sum total of our choices. 
          I can live with that.

                      DEBI
          Other people can't.

     Martin looks at her earnestly... And smiles ever so slightly. 
     She does the same, and then just a little wider. He the same. 
     They turn back out to face the lawn, and they share a laugh...

                                           THE END
