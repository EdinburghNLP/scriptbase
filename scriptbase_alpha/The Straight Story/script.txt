1     EXT.--NIGHT SKY

     Autumn evening FULL of STARS. Music plays over
     as credits roll.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

2     EXT.--DAY  LAURENS, IOWA

     It is a hot day in early September in Laurens, a small
     rural community in north central Iowa. The main
     drag, all of four blocks, is bookended by a giant
     grain elevator and a John Deere dealership. No cars
     on the road.

                         CUT TO:

3     EXT.--DAY  SMALL HOUSE & NEIGHBORING HOUSE

     At the neighboring house, DOROTHY, a rather
     large woman, 50ish, with bleached blond, cropped
     hair is sunbathing in a chaise lounge. She is wearing
     bermuda shorts, a tank top and eye protectors over
     her eyes. Next to her is a small table with a plate on
     it. Out of the other house, which has chipped siding
     and faded, peeling window frames, comes ROSE
     (late 30s, brown hair in a pixie cut, stocky, in jeans
     and a cotton shirt). The door slams and Rose heads
     down the walk. Dorothy doesn't move a muscle or
     remove her eye protectors.

                    DOROTHY
          Hey Rose.

     Rose doesn't break stride but yells over...

                    ROSE
           Hey Dorothy.

     Rose exits and we remain on the two houses and
       Dorothy sunbathing. After a moment, Dorothy
     reaches over and feels the plate next to her. She lifts
     the protectors and checks out the table...sees she's
     out of treats, gets up, grabs the plate and heads into
     her house. As the screen door slams shut behind her
     we slowly move in on the house Rose came from.
     We might be hearing footsteps as we move closer.
     The sound leads us slowly toward the rear of the
     house. As we continue moving closer we hear a short
     peel of rubber followed by a thudding sound and a
     sound like a stick dropping. We hold on the house
     in silence.

                          CUT TO:

4     EXT.--DAY  HOUSE AND NEIGHBORING HOUSE

     As before. Dorothy comes back out carrying the
     plate now filled with treats. Munching all the while
     she settles back into the chaise lounge and resumes
     sunbathing.

                          DISSOLVE TO:

5      EXT.--DAY  LATER--SMALL TOWN BAR IN LAURENS

      A small brick storefront bar. Two windows with
     neon beer signs are on either side of a red door with
     a window in the shape of a tilted martini glass. The
     door opens and BUD, a stocky 70ish man in jeans,
     a cotton shirt and construction boots emerges. He
     looks down the street. Not seeing anyone he turns
     and sticks his head back in the door of the bar and
     yells in...

                    BUD
          I'm goin' over there.

     He lets the door close and heads off down the street.
     Another man, SIG, late 60's, 6'0", 265 lbs., in bib
     overalls and a seed cap, comes out the bar door
     holding a long-neck beer bottle and watches Bud
     walk away.

                    SIG
          We're waitin'.

                         CUT TO:

6     EXT.--DAY  LAURENS RESIDENTIAL STREET

     Bud is striding down the street past small and
     weatherbeaten houses. The yards are mowed and
     dotted with lawn chairs and picnic tables. He
     approaches the house we saw earlier. He turns up
     the walkway, reaches the front door and starts
     knocking somewhat angrily.

                    BUD
          Alvin! Alvin Straight!

                         CUT TO:

7     EXT.--DAY  THE NEIGHBOR'S YARD

     Dorothy doesn't move a muscle when she hears the
     knocking. She yells across the yard to Bud.

                    DOROTHY
          Rose left a couple of hours ago.

                         CUT TO:

8     EXT.--DAY SMALL HOUSE

     Bud jumps. He hadn't seen Dorothy until she spoke.

                    BUD
          Did you hear me hollerin' for Rose? I'm
          not lookin' for Rose.

                    DOROTHY
          I ain't seen Alvin today.

                    BUD
          Did I ask....

      Bud stops for a look at Dorothy who still has the eye
     protectors on. He shakes his head in exasperation.
     He resumes knocking on the door.

                    BUD
          Straight. ......you're late!!

     Not getting any response he heads around to the
     backyard and finds no one. He goes up to the back
     door and starts knocking.

                    BUD (cont'd)
          Alvin?!

                         CUT TO:

9     INT.--DAY  KITCHEN

     From inside the darkened kitchen we see Bud
     through the door window, knocking.

                    BUD
          What the hell Alvin!

     At a break in his knocking on the door we hear an
     off-camera voice.

                    ALVIN
          Come on in Bud.

     Bud, startled, reaches down, opens the door and
     enters. He stands blinking and flustered, letting his
     eyes adjust to the darkened room.

                    BUD
          Where the hell are you Alvin? I can't
          see a damn thing.

                    ALVIN
          I'm right here Bud...watch your step.

     Bud's eyes adjust and he follows the sound of Alvin's
     voice to the kitchen floor right at his feet. ALVIN
     STRAIGHT is stretched out on the floor. He is in
     his 70s, a lean man, weathered face, bald with a full,
     scruffy white beard. He is wearing a plaid cotton
     shirt, worn jeans and black cowboy boots. There is a
     wooden cane lying on the floor next to him.

                    BUD
          What the hell's goin' on? What in god-
          damn hell are you doin' on the floor
          Alvin? What'r ye nuts? You're supposed
          to be down at Davmar's one hour ago.

     At this point a shadow falls on them and Dorothy
     fills the door frame.

                    DOROTHY
          What's going on....

     She sees Alvin on the floor.

                    DOROTHY (cont'd)
               (panicking)
          Oh my god Alvin!

                    ALVIN
               (with resignation)
          Hey there Dorothy.

     Dorothy makes a beeline for the phone, and picks it
     up.

                    BUD
          What the hell are you doin'?

                     DOROTHY
               (breathlessly)
           What's the number for 911?

      Bud rolls his eyes.

                    ALVIN
               (with authority)
          Dorothy, put that phone down.

     She doesn't move. Her face flushed, bosom heaving,
     she looks back and forth between Alvin, Bud and
     the phone. Bud strides over to her and yanks the
     phone out of her hand.

                    BUD
          I gotta call the bar and tell them we're
          not comin'.

     Dorothy grabs the phone back, wild-eyed.

                    DOROTHY
          Bud Heimstra are you crazy? We have a
          stricken man here.

      Bud hesitates and looks over at Alvin, assessing his
      condition.

                    BUD
          You stricken Alvin?

      Dorothy starts dialing.

                    ALVIN
          Dorothy, PUT THAT PHONE DOWN!

     Dorothy hesitates. Bud tries to wrestle the phone
     from her. We hear the front door slam and Dorothy
     and Bud freeze. Rose enters the kitchen from the
     front of the house.

                    ROSE
          Dad? What's all the.......yelling?

      She stops short. She takes in the scene...Bud and
     Dorothy at the phone and her dad on the floor.

                    ROSE (cont'd)
          What have you...........done to my dad?

                    BUD
          Oh for cry aye.

                    ROSE
          Dad?..........are you........?

      Rose starts to cry.

                    ALVIN
               (exasperated but forcefully)
          I just need some help gettin' up.

                         CUT TO:

10      EXT.--DAY  PARKING LOT

     We see Rose helping Alvin get out of the passenger
     side of their car. Once standing, Alvin won't move.
     Rose is tugging on his arm. He is not budging and
     he's shaking his head.

                    ALVIN
          I'm not goin'.

                    ROSE
          Dad.....

                    ALVIN
          I'm not goin'.

                    ROSE
          Dad....you promised me.

     After a pause Alvin nods.

                    ALVIN
          Alright Rosie.

     They slowly make their way across the hot parking
     lot to the Doctor's office.

                         CUT TO:

     OMIT SCENES 11, 12, & 13.

                         CUT TO:

14      INT.--DAY  EXAMINING ROOM

      The nurse and Alvin enter the examining room. She
     turns to him and hands him a robe.

                    NURSE
          O.K. Mr. Straight, you need to take off
          all your clothes except your underwear
          and put this robe on.

                    ALVIN
               (gruffly)
          Just bring me the doctor.

                         CUT TO:

15     INT.--DAY  DOCTOR'S RECEPTION, LATER

     Rose is standing in front of a series of bird paintings.

                    ROSE
          I see you like birds. I build.......bird-
          houses........for bluebirds.

                    NURSE
          Oh, that's nice.

                    ROSE
          Yah.....Pete sells my birdhouses........at
          the.....Ace.

                    NURSE
          Oh...I'll look for them next time I'm
          in.

                         CUT TO:

16     INT.--DAY  EXAMINING ROOM

      Alvin leans against the examining table as he pulls
     his pants to a close and fastens his belt. He is shirt-
     less. His skin hangs loosely off his rib cage. He has a
     serious farmer's tan: lily white chest and shoulders
     and arms with nut brown face, neck and hands. A
     middle-aged DOCTOR GIBBONS is standing
     looking over some notes.

                    DOCTOR GIBBONS
          So you're not sure just how long you
          were on the floor?

                    ALVIN
               (shaking his head)
          I remember my cane slippin'...and
          losing my balance....
               (he pauses, concentrating)
          ...next thing I knew Bud Heimstra was
          banging on my kitchen door.

     The doctor nods at this account and writes something
     in his notes. Alvin sits on the examining table
     and looks around. He takes in the foreign room:
     bright fluorescent lights, slick pastel Formica
     surfaces, matching pastel framed art, bio-hazard
     warnings and medical equipment. He looks back to the
     Doctor and catches the man watching him with a
     look of concern on his face.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          Somethin' the matter Doc?

     The Doctor switches to an attempt at a smile.

                      DOCTOR GIBBONS
          Listen Alvin, sometimes it's my job to
          tell people things they don't want to
           hear. I'm concerned about you. I think
          you need an operation on those hips.

                    ALVIN
          No operations.

                    DOCTOR
          Well...this morning you fall and can't
          get off the floor...that's your hips Alvin.
          You'll have to use a walker to get
          around now.

                    ALVIN
               (barks)
          No walker.

                    DOCTOR
          Fine...a second cane then. You say
          you're not seeing too well. That could
          be a diabetes-related problem. I would
          like to run some...

                    ALVIN
           No!

     The doctor looks back down at his notes and up at
     Alvin.

                      DOCTOR GIBBONS
          I can see and hear that you smoke. I
          would guess you're in the early stages of
          emphysema. And Alvin you have
          circulation problems. I worry about your
          diet and unless you change some things
          quick, there will be some serious
          consequences.

     Alvin doesn't say anything. He just stares at the
     Doctor.

                         CUT TO:

17     INT.--DAY  KITCHEN

     ALVIN sits at the kitchen table and takes a deep
     drag off of a Swisher Sweet. Two canes are propped
     up against the table. Rose looks on. She stands in
     the middle of the kitchen holding a birdhouse, fret-
     fully watching Alvin. She holds the birdhouse out to
     him.

                    ROSE
          It has a.........red roof.

      Alvin looks at the birdhouse and smiles at Rose.

                    ALVIN
          That's another pretty one Rose.

     He continues smoking. Rose, pleased at his
     response, turns smiling to do a few dishes. She sets
     the birdhouse down.

                    ROSE
          I want to paint the.......next roof...
               (she blurts)
          ...blue.

     Alvin smiles again.

                    ALVIN
          That's a good idea.

     Rose turns to the window and thinks for a while
      with a smile on her face. As she reflects, her smile
     begins to fade.

                    ROSE
          What did the.......Doctor say?

      Alvin puts out the Swisher Sweet.

                    ALVIN
          Said I'm goin' to live to be a hundred.

     Rose smiles at this. Alvin stands, puts on a cream-
     colored Stetson and heads to the back door.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          Time to cut the lawn.

                    ROSE
          I can......cut it for......you...Dad.

     Alvin is navigating the door with his two canes in
     hand. Says gently back over his shoulder.

                    ALVIN
          I got it sweetheart.

     Rose turns, clears the table and takes dishes over to
     the kitchen sink. Out the window over her shoulder
     we see Alvin cross the backyard and mount a Rehds
     riding mower. She sets the dishes in the sink, then
     gets distracted by the birdhouse.

                         CUT TO:

18     EXT.--DAY  ALVIN'S BACKYARD

     Alvin tries to start the mower. No luck. He performs
     a slow, painful, laborious dismount. Then in a quick
     move he turns and bangs the mower with his cane.

                    ALVIN
          Damn!

                         CUT TO:

19     INT.--DAY  LAURENS ACE HARDWARE

     A group of locals are in the store. SIG, BUD, PETE,
     mid-60s, 6'0", lean, gray and wearing slacks and a
     red Ace vest, and APPLE, early 60s, short, bald and
     talkative. He is wearing a short-sleeve shirt and a tie.
     He's concentrating on his right boot. He frowns as
     he works it up and down with his toes. His attention
     is split between working the shoe and watching
     the Weather Channel which is on the television over
     the counter.

                    APPLE
               (all the while
               stomping his foot)
          Looks like another low comin' out of
          the panhandle of Texas. That's where
          they all come from. You know in the
          winter that's where we get all our big
          dumps.

                    PETE
          Apple I doubt very much if we'll be
          getting snow this week.

     Sig giggles.

                    SIG
          And here comes Alvin Straight. He's
          not movin' too well.

                    PETE
          Well he took that bad fall.

                    BUD
          An hour late! I found the darn fool on
          the kitchen floor.

                    SIG
          He looks like he ain't gonna make it to
          the door. If he was a horse they'd shoot
          'im.

                      PETE
               (scolding)
          How old are you now Sig?

     Apple has his shoe off and is digging inside of it
     with his hand. He looks up at Pete's remark.

                    APPLE
          He's 70 in September..."Oh the days
          dwindle down to a precious few..."

                    SIG
          You can shut up any time Apple.

     Alvin enters. They turn their heads, nod hello. Bud
     scowls.

                    PETE
          Mornin' Alvin. What can I do for you?

      Alvin approaches the counter and opens his mouth
     to speak but is interrupted by...

                     APPLE
           Local forecast!

                          CUT TO:

20     INT.--DAY  HARDWARE STORE TELEVISION

     The Weather Channel. The local forecast runs with
     the accompanying music. Conversation stops
     abruptly and they all turn to watch the local forecast
     together. There is the potential for thunderstorms
     later in the day with a possible tornado watch.

                    PETE
          And what can I do you for Alvin?

                    ALVIN
          Plugs for the Rehds. Won't start.

21     EXT.--LATE DAY  ALVIN'S BACKYARD

     Alvin is changing the plugs, smoking Swisher
     Sweets. Rose is sitting on aluminum lawn chair
     painting the roof of her birdhouse blue. A storm is
     moving in. Alvin looks up to the sky.

                    ALVIN
          Storm comin'...not mowin' today.

                         CUT TO:

24     INT.--NIGHT  ALVIN'S LIVING ROOM

     Rose and Alvin sit by the window watching the
     lightning. A big bolt cuts through the sky to the
     ground.

                    ALVIN
          I love a lightning storm.

                    ROSE
          Me....too Dad.

     The phone rings. Rose is reluctant to leave the show
     at the window and lets it ring 3 or 4 times. Finally
     she gets up and leaves the room to answer the phone
     in the kitchen.

                    ROSE
               (off camera)
          Hello.........this.......is Rose.
          Yah...yah...Uncle......Lyle?

     Alvin's expression changes to a frown as the light of
     the TV plays off his face. He does not turn his head
     or speak but he is listening and reacting to Rose's
     conversation.

                    ROSE (cont'd)
          Oh.......no. When? O.K. Ah..ah...I'll
          tell him. Yah. O.K. bye.

     Rose comes back in and sits down. She doesn't say
     anything and neither does Alvin for a bit. We see
     another big crack of lightning out the window. The
     Storm Watch continues off screen.

                    WEATHER PERSON
               (voice over)
          A tornado has been sited in Ida
          County. Sac, Calhoun and Pocahontas

                    ROSE (cont'd)
          That was Bobby...Uncle Lyle had a....a
          .....ah...stroke.

     On the word "stroke," a bolt of lightning brilliantly
     illuminates Alvin's face. Then he sits stonefaced in
     darkness looking out the window. He doesn't respond.

                    ROSE (cont'd)
          Dad?

     Alvin's house is being buffeted by a fierce
     midwestern electrical storm.

26     EXT.--DAY  ALVIN'S YARD

     Alvin is mowing the lawn.

                          CUT TO:

27     INT.--DAY  ALVIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN

     Rose is standing at the kitchen window talking on
     the phone. Over Rose's shoulder Alvin crosses back
     and forth through the window frame riding the
     mower. Rose is talking to one of her brothers.

                    ROSE
          No Bobby he....didn't say much......They
          both been so......stubborn. No......no it
          was longer. I remember...It was July 7,
          1988. Bobby, I always remember.....the
          dates.

     Through the window we see Alvin stop the mower.
     He sits and stares. He lights up a Swisher Sweet.

                    ROSE (cont'd)
          I....don't know...what......he'll do.

     Rose hangs up and looks back out at Alvin sitting
     on mower.

                         CUT TO:

28     INT.--NIGHT  ALVIN'S LIVING ROOM

     Rose is sitting in the dark looking out the window at
     the freshly mown lawn. She hears a noise and turns.
     There is Alvin, with two canes, silhouetted in the
     doorway to the kitchen.

                    ALVIN
          Rose honey, why don't you come in here
          and join your dad for a cup of coffee.

     Rose looks puzzled. This is not a common invitation
     from Alvin.

                    ROSE
          Dad..........we're not going to move
          again are we? You always set me down
          for a coffee when you tell me we are
          going to move again.

     Alvin laughs a little. Rose is clearly wary.

                    ALVIN
          No honey...we're not breaking camp.

     Rose sighs in relief and smiles. Alvin pauses, clearly
     uncomfortable.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          Unless you make so many bluebird
          houses we run outa room.

                    ROSE
               (taking her
               father seriously)
          Dad..oh jeez..I can stop making them...

                    ALVIN
          Easy honey. Your pa was just makin' a
          joke.

     Rose is relieved. Alvin pauses and draws a breath.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          Rose. I'm goin' to get back out on the
          road. I'm goin' to go see Lyle.

                    ROSE
          But Dad....how are you.......?

     Alvin turns and starts to hobble toward the kitchen.

                    ALVIN
          I haven't quite figured that out yet.

     He moves off into the kitchen.

                         CUT TO:

29     EXT.--DAY  ALVIN'S BACKYARD

     From around the side of the house comes Rose hauling
     a large piece of aged plywood. She talks as she
     wrestles with the large board. She is speaking to
     Alvin who is on the back stoop with a wrench and a
     ball joint. She is also reasoning aloud with herself.

                    ROSE
          One...Your eyes are bad....That is why
          you don't drive your car because you
          cannot see the signs anymore.

     Rose turns and looks directly at Alvin. He is letting
     her vent.

                    ROSE (cont'd)
          One...Your eyes are bad.

     Rose walks back around the corner of the house and
     returns with another large piece of old plywood. As
     Rose enunciates her reasons she ticks them off on
     her fingers.

                    ROSE (cont'd)
          Two...Lyle is in Wisconsin which is 317
          miles away. You can't take any bus
          straight to Mt. Zion. You'd have to stay
          overnight in Des Moines....and.....then
          there's no bus to Zion.

     Rose eyes Alvin again. She vanishes around the
     corner one more time. Alvin continues working on
     the ball joint, adding oil to loosen the bolt. Rose
     comes around the corner again.

                    ROSE
          Three....Your hips. You can't hardly
          stand for two minutes and when you
          do stand up after you are sitting down
          this is the sound you make when you
          stand... "aaaaaraaaaarrrrhhgggg. " That is
          your arthritis sound.

     Alvin chuckles at her impersonation of him. She is
     almost finished with her tasks. Her talking slows as
     she gets to the last of her rant.

                    ROSE (cont'd)
          Four....You are 73 years old. You were
          born when Calvin Coolidge was
          President of America.

     Rose sits down next to Alvin on the stoop. She is
     hot, tired, worried and upset. Her voice almost
     breaks as she finishes her speech.

                    ROSE (cont'd)
          You are 73 years old......And I can't
          drive you there.

                    ALVIN
          Rosie....darlin'....I'm not dead yet.

     This subdues Rose. Alvin looks at her for a beat,
     turns and moves to a stool with the wrench and ball
     joint. He begins screwing the ball joint to a beam.

                    ROSE
               (tired and exasperated)
          What are we building?

                         CUT TO:

30      INT.--NEXT DAY  GROCERY STORE

     Rose is pushing a grocery cart down the aisle. She
     checks a list in her hand.

                    ROSE
          Coffee.

     Rose places eight large cans of Folgers into the cart.
     She counts as she deposits them.

                    ROSE (cont'd)
          One...two...three...four...five...six...
          seven... eight.

      She checks list again.

                    ROSE (cont'd)
          Wieners....

     Rose places several large packs of wieners in the cart.

                    ROSE (cont'd)
          One...two...three....four...five.....six.

     She reaches back into the cold meat case.

                    ROSE (cont'd)
          Braunschweiger.

      Rose makes faces in incremental disgust as she
     counts.

                    ROSE (cont'd)
          One......two........three.......four....

      She hates braunschweiger. She checks her list again.
     She moves down the aisle and into the next one. She
     pauses before a display.

                    ROSE (cont'd)
          Bug juice.

      Rose throws insect repellent into the cart.

                     ROSE (cont'd)
           One.

      She checks her list and nods in satisfaction, heading
     to the checkout counter.

31     INT.--DAY  GROCERY STORE CHECKOUT COUNTER

      Rose is loading her purchases onto the counter.
     BRENDA the checkout girl looks on with a curious
     expression. Brenda is 20ish, cute, a little hefty.
     Very cheerful.

                     BRENDA
               (a statement)
          Havin' a party.

      Rose looks at her blankly.

                    ROSE
          Oh......Jeez I love parties.

                     BRENDA
          Yah, me too.

                    ROSE
          So where's it at?

     Brenda is confused.

                     BRENDA
          Where's what at?

                    ROSE
          Your party.

                    BRENDA
          I'm not havin' a party. I thought you're
          havin' a party.

                    ROSE
          I am?

                    BRENDA
          Well yah...look at all that braunsweiger.

                    ROSE
          Yah it's a lot of braunschweiger.

     Brenda starts to ring up the braunschweiger.

                    ROSE
          It's for my dad.....for his.....trip. My
          dad.......He...is going to.......Wisconsin.

                       BRENDA
          Oh Wisconsin! A real party state.

     Rose is keeping an eye on her items. She makes a
     "yuk" face.

                    ROSE
          I hate braunschweiger.

     Brenda, still checking, nods in assent and makes a
     sour face.

32     EXT.--DAY  ALVIN'S BACKYARD

     Rose comes walking out of the house with groceries.
     She sets them on the picnic table and heads back
     into the house. Alvin loads the groceries into the
     now finished trailer. The back door of the house
     opens and a big sheet of foam rubber flies out the
     door followed by Rose. She hauls it over to the trailer
     and sets it in. She fusses over its arrangement.

                         CUT TO:

33      INT.--DAY  ACE HARDWARE

     Pete, Sig, Apple, & Bud are in the store. They are
     watching the Weather Channel. Sig has a toothpick
     in his mouth. Apple is sitting on a stool. Alvin and
     Rose enter.

                    PETE
          Morning Alvin. How are you today
          Rose?

      Alvin nods. Rose smiles.

                    ROSE

          goin' to get there.....but he doesn't

     Alvin throws a look at Rose. She smiles.

                    PETE
          Your bluebird houses are selling well
          Rose. I'm gonna need some more from
          you.

          Taking a trip Alvin eh?

                    ALVIN
          Yup.

     Apple is sitting on a stool with one shoe off. His
     hand is inside the shoe.

                    APPLE
          Well if you're traveling by car you
          know my wife'll get those AAA trip tix.
          Those babies'll tell you where every
          piece of construction is all along the
          "I" system.

                    PETE
          I don't suspect Alvin'll be takin' your
          wife along with him Apple.

                    ALVIN
          Oh Lord.

                    BUD
          You can take my wife.

     Alvin chuckles and then sets one cane against the
     counter. With his other cane he makes his way down
     the store aisle to the gas cans. He grabs one 5-gallon
     container and heads back to the counter.

                    SIG
          Where's your brother at Alvin?

      Alvin sets the can on the counter. He turns to walk
     back down the aisle.

                    ROSE
          Mt. Zion. Sixty-three miles east of the
          Missi.....ssippi.

                    PETE
          Sixty-three miles, eh Rose?

          old mighty Mississipp..is the single
          most profitable waterway in the world?
          Did you know that the Japanese harvest
          pearls outta the river down to
          Prairie du Chien....pearls!

          And walleye...need help there Alvin?

                    ALVIN
          No thanks, Pete.

     Pete and Sig exchange a glance and look at Rose.
     She smiles. Alvin picks up another 5-gallon gas can.

                    SIG
          What's doin' at your brother's Alvin?
          The Straight family reunion?

      Alvin gives Sig a look.

                    ALVIN
          You could say that.

     Alvin puts the other gas can on the counter.

                    SIG
               (goading Alvin)
          Alvin you got three 5-gallon cans.
          Fifteen gallons of gas there. Just what
          you gonna do with that much gas?

      Rose is getting nervous with Sig's prying ways. She
     knows that this is a sensitive area for Alvin. She
     looks to the TV.

                    ROSE
          Local forecast!

     The whole gang stops and watches as the Weather
     Channel gives the local forecast.

      As soon as it is over they look at each other to
     remember where they were in conversation.

                    SIG
          Ahh....so what you need so much gas
          for Alvin?

     Alvin returns to the counter. This time he has two
     medium-sized Styrofoam coolers. Alvin stops and
     looks long at Sig.

                    ALVIN
          Sig, you are one nosy sonofagun.

                    BUD
          You got that right.

     Sig clamps his jaw. Alvin turns back to Pete.

                    ALVIN
          Pete, I'd like to buy that from you.

     Alvin points to a contraption used in hardware
     stores to grab things on high shelves. Pete sees what
     he's pointing to and gets a possessive jolt. He turns
     to Alvin.

                    PETE
          Jeez Alvin.

                    ALVIN
          Well?

      Pete eyes the grabber. He looks down the aisle to the
     other end of the store where he's got another grabber
     hanging.

                    PETE
          I do have two of them...I guess I could
          sell you that one.

                    ALVIN
          Five bucks would seem about right.

                    PETE
               (puzzled)
          Those things are hard to come by Alvin.
          It would take me two months to get
          another one on order. That's a damn
          good grabber. Jeez...I can't let that grabber
          go for less than.....jeez.....$10.00.

                    ALVIN
               (considering, not
               too happy)
          OK. Ring her up.

     Pete pulls down the grabber and longingly works it a
     few times and sets it reluctantly down on the
     counter. Alvin smiles. Pete starts ringing up Alvin's
     items.

                    PETE
          Three 5-gallon gas cans at $9.89. Two
          Styrofoam coolers...

     The beautiful bells and clicks and hammers of the
     old cash register are the only sounds in the room.

                    PETE
          Two coolers, 99 cents and
          one....one...Alvin...

                    ALVIN
          Ring it up Pete.

                    PETE
          With tax that's $44.25.

     Alvin fishes out a large black wallet held to his belt
     by a chain. He pulls out two twenties and a five and
     hands them to Pete.

      Alvin turns to him.

                    ALVIN
          Grabbin'.

     Apple has his arm up to his elbow digging in his
     boot. Suddenly he feels something.

                    APPLE

35      EXT.--DAY  ALVIN'S BACKYARD

     Alvin and Rose are in the backyard. Alvin takes a can
     of W-2 lubricant. He sprays the hitch holder on the
     trailer. Then he laboriously makes his way across the
     lawn to the riding mower. He sprays the hitch ball on
     the mower. Rose is confused. Alvin then mounts the
     lawn mower. He begins backing it up to the trailer.
     Awareness finally crosses Rose's face. Her jaw drops.

                    ROSE
          Oh.....jeeez Dad. Oh jeez......Dad.

36     EXT.--NIGHT  ALVIN'S BACKYARD

     Alvin is seated on a chaise lounge smoking a Swisher
     Sweet. He is looking at his mower/trailer rig. A
     mosquito coil burns beside him, casting a warm glow on
     the scene. Rose is lying on the ground on a blanket
     looking up at the stars. It is a beautiful autumn
     evening.

                    ROSE (cont'd)
          ...that trailer is too heavy for that...it's a
          lawnmower. You are going to....drive....a
          lawnmower to...another state.

                    ALVIN
          Now Rose you gotta cease with your
          worryin'. You get that from your
          mother.

                    ROSE
          But Dad....you....can't.

                    ALVIN
          Rose...."can't" doesn't live here.

      Alvin takes a puff of cigar.

                    ALVIN
          It's gonna be fine Rose.

                    ROSE
          Dad....please. I will find someone to
          drive you to Wisconsin. Pete........you
          like Pete.....Pete...he is a good driver.

                    ALVIN
          Now, Rose, sweetheart......

     Rose is starting to tear up. She is so worried about
     what he is doing. He reaches down and takes her
      hand.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          I been on the road plenty. Didn't your
          mom and I haul you kids all around
          the country?

      Rose nods, close to tears. She counts.

                    ROSE
          One, Wisconsin...Two, Minnesota...
          Three, Wyoming but not long...Four
          was Oregon. We had goats. Five.....New
          Mexico and......six.....good old....Iowa.

                    ALVIN
          Remember when we traveled...you and
          your sister and brothers...

     Rose nods and the reminiscence makes her happy.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          We sure saw a lot. We all liked travelin'.

                    ROSE
          Yeah.
               (smiling at first but
               then the worry returns)
          But this is different Dad.

                    ALVIN
          It is Rose...it's easier..I'm not luggin'
          seven kids in the back.

     Rose nods. Her emotions are confused.

                    ROSE
          But Dad.....you will be all alone. Won't
          you be lonely?

                    ALVIN
          Rosie...sometimes a man likes bein' a
          little lonely.

     Rose ponders this notion. A new anxiety creeps in.

                    ROSE
          I will be alone......here...

     This stops Alvin. He realizes he hadn't really thought
     about that and it makes him feel both bad and a little
     worried. He hides his concern.

                    ALVIN
          And you're going to be just fine.
          Dorothy is next door and she can't keep
          her nose out of our business. She'll be
          over here seven times a day.

     Rose laughs.

                    ROSE
          Wait 'til she hears about.........this Dad.

     They both share a laugh.

                    ALVIN
          Rose I got to go see Lyle. I got to make
          this trip on my own. I know you
          understand that.

     building sound. A huge truck approaches and flies
     by Alvin with a deafening roar. It completely rattles
     lawn mower, trailer, and Alvin. Alvin's hat is blown
     off. He has to stop the mower, get out his canes, do
     the slow dismount. He struggles down through a
     ditch into a field. He retrieves the hat, goes back
     down through the ditch. He climbs back up out of
     the ditch onto the road and mounts the mower. Real
     time. Just as he sits down, the tractor dies. Alvin
     hauls himself off the mower again and pops the
     hood. Shaking his head he gets back on the mower.

     The stations of the Cross are represented on the two
     sides of the interior walls. Alvin sits on a bench in a
     courtyard inside the Grotto looking at what he sees.
     The bench is situated under a spreading oak tree. In
     the background we see the group from the bus with
     the tour guide talking through a megaphone.

                    TOUR GUIDE
          ...The Pastor of this Catholic Parish
          began his work on the Grotto in 1912
          and continued it until his death in
          1954. All this work you see before you
          was done by hand...

     An old gentleman (WENDELL) breaks from the
     group and approaches Alvin. Wendell is wearing a
     seersucker suit with a bow tie. He is walking with
     one cane. He walks up to Alvin sitting on the bench.

                    WENDELL
          May I share the bench? As you can see
          I have a little arthritis myself.

                    ALVIN
          Be my guest.

     Wendell sits, gets himself situated and leans forward
     on his cane.

                    WENDELL
          This was one fellow who had quite a
          bit of time on his hands.

                    ALVIN
          A lot of work.

     The tour guide in the background has made some
     comment which causes all the women to start
     giggling. Alvin and Wendell turn at this.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          So how's it traveling with a hen house?

                    WENDELL
          Well I'll tell you. My wife passed away
          in '87. After she was gone I spent a lot
          of time alone. Oh there were women
          who came out of the woodwork trying
          to cook and clean for me. I managed to
          keep myself unattached and they finally
          stopped coming around. Then things
          got pretty quiet. I got to missing
           things.

                    ALVIN
          My wife passed in 1981.

     Wendell nods and they sit quiet for a moment.

                    WENDELL
          My daughter tricked me into one of
          these bus trips a couple of years ago. It
          was The House on the Rock if I'm not
          mistaken. A very interesting structure
          that. I was the only man on that bus. It
          was a singular experience.

                    ALVIN
          I bet.

     They share a chuckle.

                    WENDELL
          I was pleasantly surprised at how much
          I enjoyed all that femininity. I discovered
          how much I missed it. Since then
          I make one of these bus trips every
          other month. I rather enjoy the
          attention.

                    ALVIN
          I live with my daughter Rose. Of
          course, it's different from being with
          my wife, but it's a comfort to have a
          woman around.

                    WENDELL
          There's not a man born who doesn't
          enjoy being fussed over.

                    ALVIN
          You wouldn't a had your way with any
          of these fillies now wouldja?

     Wendell pauses and chuckles.

                    WENDELL
          It is a wonder how invigorating a
          tumble with a maiden can be.

                    ALVIN
          If there's a maiden on that bus I'll dance a
           jig.

                    WENDELL
               (chuckling again)
           See those three over there? They're
          Dominican nuns.

      Alvin begins laughing and Wendell joins in.
     Without rising from the bench Alvin moves his
     feet in a jig. The two fellas laugh again. They hear
     an outburst of giggles from the gaggle of gals and
     look their way. One of the women waves to
     Wendell. He waves back. The two men sit in
     silence for a while.

                    WENDELL (cont'd)
          That's an interesting attachment to
          your lawn mower.

                    ALVIN
          You mean my trailer.

                    WENDELL
          Is that what that is? Why would you
          attach a trailer to a lawnmower?

                    ALVIN
          I'm takin' a trip. That's where I bunk.

                    WENDELL
          A trip on a lawnmower? That's an
          interesting means of conveyance. A bit
          hard on the hips isn't it?

                    ALVIN
          No worse than a tumble with a maiden.

     The two laugh again.

                    ALVIN
          It's not too bad. A little rough on the
          dismount.

     They laugh some more. It subsides.

                    WENDELL
          And what's your destination?

                     ALVIN
           Mt. Zion.

                     WENDELL
          Wisconsin?

                     ALVIN
           Yup.

                    WENDELL
          I admire your gumption.

     Two women have broken away from the crowd and
     approach the bench.

                    FIRST WOMAN
          Oh Wendell. The tour guide has so
          much to say. We hate to see you miss
          this.

     Wendell turns to Alvin and winks. Woman number
     two reaches down and flicks some lint off of Alvin's

                    ALVIN
          Thank you.

     The woman blushes. Wendell stands and turns to
     Alvin.

                    WENDELL
          Bon voyage my friend.

                    ALVIN
          Adios.

     Wendell and the two women walk away.

     Alvin tight as he rolls along the highway at a surpris-
     ingly fast speed. He is holding on to his hat. Pull
     back slowly to reveal Alvin on the bed of a pickup
     sitting on his lawn mower as it rolls back into
     Laurens.

59     INT.--DAY  LAURENS ACE HARDWARE

      The Weather Channel is on. The locals all turn their
     heads as Alvin passes through their view out of the
     window.

                    SIG
          Told ya that mower wouldn't make it
          mor'n a few miles. Alvin (shakes his
          head), he's got more brass than
          brains.

                    PETE
               (almost to himself)
          Hardly out a full day.

                    APPLE
          Least he's not hurt. Old timer like that
          on the road. There's no tellin'.

     Pete, Apple and Sig stand looking as Alvin passes.
     Alvin looks straight ahead.

                    WEATHER PERSON
               (off camera)
          ...and now for your local forecast.

     Contrary to their previous actions when the local
     forecast is announced, Pete, Sig and Apple do not
      take their eyes off of Alvin. They walk to the
     window as he passes out of frame. They peer down the
     street after him.

60     INT.--DAY  ALVIN'S KITCHEN

      Rose is sitting at the kitchen table with Dorothy.
     Between them is a large bowl of potato chips and
     they are each drinking a large glass of milk.
     Dorothy's hair is now bright red.

                    ROSE
          ...so the man in a pick up...he brought
          my...my dad back.

                    DOROTHY
          Oh...I must've been at the beauty
          parlor. What kinda pickup?

      Alvin enters kitchen from inside the house, passes
     by them and on out the back door. He is carrying a
     pump action shotgun under his arm. He has a
     little trouble with the canes, the gun and the back
     door. The gals stop talking until he goes out the
     door.

                    ROSE
          A Ford.

     Dorothy's eyes are glued to Alvin as she watches him
     through the kitchen window crossing the lawn.

                    DOROTHY
          What's your dad doin' with that gun?

                    ROSE
          I.....don't know. My dad...he got
          medals in the war for sharpshootin'....
          But his eyes ain't so good now.

     All through this we see Alvin out in the yard. He
     begins to put his canes down and prop himself up
     against a picnic table.

                    ROSE (cont'd)
          Once he shot....a cougar....right
           out....of a tree....it was up above me
          and my......brother Bobby.

     Through the window we see Alvin pick up the shot-
     gun and raise it to his shoulder. The two women
     unconsciously rise up out of their seats and move
     toward the window to see what is going on. Alvin
     pumps the shotgun and fires. The women can now
     see the target -- the Rehds lawnmower explodes.
     Alvin pumps once more and finishes it off.

                    DOROTHY
          Jeez.

                    ALVIN

      Pan across flat Iowa landscape to huge John Deere
     sign. The camera moves down to find a herd of
     the huge, green titans of farm machinery; the John
     Deere tractors. We first see the biggest farm tractors
     John Deere makes, some more than a story tall
     with air-conditioned cabs, CD players and onboard
     global positioning computers. As the camera
     moves the vehicles get smaller, until the shot
     comes to rest on the spanking new John Deere
     Riding Mower, sparkling in the summer sun. As
     the camera rests on the riding mower we see Alvin,
     leaning on his two canes, gazing longingly at the
     mower.

63     INT.--DAY  JOHN DEERE DEALERSHIP

      Two salesmen stand sipping coffee from official John
     Deere mugs. The older man is Tom. He is late 50s,
     greying and stocky and short. A seasoned tractor
     salesman who has seen it all. He is wearing a John
     Deere sports shirt, yellow with green JD logo over
     his breast. With Tom is his young, energetic sales
     rookie, Andy. Andy is a big kid, just off the family
     farm, a little soft but full of sales gumption. He
     works on straight commission. He too is wearing a
     John Deere shirt and hat, which is a bit small for his
     great melon of a head.

                    ANDY
          That's the LD 155 right Mr. Hillenbrandt.

                    TOM
          As I told ya'...Andy I'd rather ya didn't
          call me "Mister Hillenbrandt." Tom is
          fine. People hear you call me Mister
          and they'll think I've actually become a
          real businessman. Pretty soon they'll all
          be calling me Mr. Hillenbrandt and I'd
          have to sell my implement business and
          move to someplace where folks call me
          "Tom" again.

                    ANDY
          Sorry...T...T...Tom...it's just that I've
          been calling you Mister Hillenbrandt
          all my life...

                    TOM
          Well you're out of school and a workin'
          fool like the rest of us now Andy and
          you can start usin' first names. And one
          other thing...that's not the LD 155,
          that's the LT 155.

     Alvin enters the showroom, where there are more
     riding mowers.

                    ANDY
               (confidently)
          Would you like to me to handle this
          one...Tom?

                    TOM
          Sure. It's Alvin Straight. I'm sure you'll
          do just fine Andy.

     Andy walks over to meet Alvin as he enters the door.
     As he leaves Tom ducks his head and leaves the
     showroom. He turns and looks at ALICE, the gray
     haired woman who is his bookkeeper. She crosses
     herself and raises her eyes to the heavens. Alvin is
     looking at another model of riding mower as Andy
     saunters over.

                    ANDY
          Good morning. I'm Andy Laufenberg.
          Anything I can help you with today
          sir.

                    ALVIN
          Well Andy Laufenberg...I'm looking to
          get a riding mower. I want good
          power -- comfortable ride.

                    ANDY
          Well sir this is the one to look at. It's
          the John Deere LT 155....

     Andy nervously reaches for a pamphlet.

                    ANDY (cont'd)
          It's got a 15 horsepower Kawasaki
          engine. Cast iron cylin...

                    ALVIN
           Japanese?

                    ANDY
               (flummoxed)
          No ah sir...no I'm not. I'm mostly
          Dutch.

                    ALVIN
          The engine. Kawasaki. A Japanese
          engine?

                    ANDY
          Yessir.

     Alvin grunts.

                     ANDY (cont'd)
          They...the Japanese make a very fine
          engine. The LD 155...

                    ALVIN
           LT.

                    ANDY
           Beg your pardon?

                    ALVIN
          LT...LT 155...says here right on the
          side.

      Andy is flustered and begins fumbling with the
     pamphlet.

                    ANDY
          And you're right sir...similar models. By
          Gish that is the LT 155. Same engine
          looks like and...it's...got....air
          cooling...electronic ignition...right here
          with that key....It's got a hydrostatic
          drive transmission.

                    ALVIN
          And what would that be?

                    ANDY
          Good question and I'm sure I can get
          that answer for you...

     Andy looks over his shoulder to search for Tom.

     Alvin chuckles. They come around a large John
     Deere field tractor and there sitting amongst the
     heaps is an old John Deere riding mower. Strong,
     simple and still green with a golden-yellow, tractor-

          '66. Has the Kohler engine. We've used
          it for parts but I always order and
          replace them when they arrive. The
          guts are good.

          What are you askin' Tom?

     Tom pauses and sighs. Looks around the lot.

                    TOM
          Alvin, we've done business before. I
          know you're an old horse trader from
          way back and I don't much feel like
          sparring with you today. Hard to find a
          price on a riding mower that's near 30
          years old. Your guess is as good as
          mine....I guess I'd just like to ask you
          what you're willing to pay.

     Alvin takes a look at the mower.

                    ALVIN
          It's a good machine?

          go and you can settle up with Alice.

                    ALVIN
          One last thing Tom. You can tell a little
          something about a machine this old by
          who's run it. Do you know who owned
          it?

     Rose is sitting at her workbench painting a bird-
     house. She frowns and shakes her head.

                    ROSE
          God.....I am.....so worried....about.......
          our dad. Please God....don't let nothin'

73     EXT.--DAY  IOWA HWY 314 AT GROTTO SIGN

     Alvin tools on by the point where he broke down
      before, tips his hat at sign. Secures his hat nice and
     snug. Here comes that ominous sound of an oncoming
     truck. Alvin shows no fear. The truck booms by,
     rocking trailer, mower and Alvin but THE HAT IS
     ROCK SOLID. Alvin smiles.

                         CUT TO:

74     EXT.--DAY  THE GROTTO

     Alvin drives past the Grotto and smiles.

75     EXT.--DAY  IOWA HIGHWAY

      Alvin is moving down the shoulder and slows to a
     stop. He pulls out his box of Swisher Sweets and
     lights up. He sits for a moment and considers the
     landscape around him: a vast expanse of flat corn-
     fields and the road stretching into the horizon ahead
     of him. The mower is idling and there is no other
     sound. He is content.

                         CUT TO:

76     EXT.--DAY

     Alvin slows down as he is passing a small woods on
     the side of the road. He comes to a stop and considers
     the woods. He makes his laborious dismount and
     stretches. He goes around back of the trailer, reaches
     in and gets his grabber and a tarp. He heads into the
     woods and begins grabbing some wood. This is no
     simple task since he's walking with the two canes.
     After grabbing a large piece of wood while placing it
     on the tarp, his hand slips off one of his canes. He
     tries to catch himself but falls face down on the
     ground. He doesn't move.

                         CUT TO:

77     EXT.--DAY  CLOSE SHOT OF ALVIN

     Cut close to Alvin's face. There is fear in his eyes and
     his breathing is labored. After collecting himself he
     looks around for his canes.

                         CUT TO:

78     EXT.--DAY  ALVIN ON THE GROUND

     He reaches out and gets a hold of his canes. With all
     his might he slowly struggles back to his feet. Still
     shaking he uses one cane to retrieve the grabber.
     With the grabber he gets the stick that had undone
     him and loads it onto the tarp and drags it over to
     the trailer. He puts the sticks into the back one by
     one. He climbs aboard and pulls back onto the
     shoulder and heads off down the highway.

                         CUT TO:

79     EXT.--LATE AFTERNOON  CAMPSITE IN A FARMER'S FIELD

     Alvin pulls off the road onto a dirt track leading
     into a field. He is in the wide open, no trees, no
     farm buildings. He takes a look at the surroundings
     and pulls off the track where the ground is slightly
     higher. He does the slow dismount off the Deere
     and stretches, rubbing his lower back. He goes about
     setting up for the night. He opens the trailer and
     pulls out an aluminum frame chaise lounge and
     some of the firewood he had gathered. He slowly
     gathers twigs & leaves for kindling for the fire. He
     opens up the food locker at the front of the trailer
     and pulls out a few items. He puts a few hot dogs
     and some bread and cheese on a plate. He sits down
     on the camping chair and proceeds to eat with little
     ceremony. It is not quite magic hour.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

80     EXT.--MAGIC HOUR  FARMER'S FIELD

     Alvin has built a fire. He sits in his lawn chair
     drinking coffee and smoking a Swisher Sweet. His
     canes are lying across his lap. The night is very quiet.
     Alvin listens to the quiet and the occasional rustle of
     small field animals. He looks to the horizon where
     the sun had set.

                         CUT TO:

81     EXT.--MAGIC HOUR

     The sky is royal blue with a band of gold at the
     horizon. Higher up the sky is navy blue and there
     are a million stars as you can only see in a clear
     country sky. Alvin sits back and enjoys his smoke.

                         FADE OUT.

                         FADE IN:

82     EXT.--DAY  HIGHWAY 18

     Alvin going down the road. He sees a small figure
     up ahead. A car whizzes past Alvin. The figure ahead
     sticks out a thumb. The car passes by. Alvin
     approaches the figure, sees it's a young, tough-
     looking girl CRYSTAL. She has dark hair under a
     baseball cap. Somewhere between 13 and 17 years
     old. Heavy eye makeup, bad tattoo on her shoulder.
     She is wearing a tank top, cut-offs, high-top sneakers
     with tiger-striped laces, and a backpack. Alvin nods
     in acknowledgment as he passes her. She coldly
     returns his gaze.

                         CUT TO:

83     EXT.--NIGHT  ALVIN'S CAMPSITE

      Alvin is eating a raw hot dog. He has built a campfire.

     Crystal is walking along.

85     EXT.--NIGHT  SAME HIGHWAY CRYSTAL'S POV

     Crystal spies Alvin's campfire in the field along the
     road. The lawnmower and trailer are clearly visible
     and she remembers him from the road.

                         CUT TO:

86     EXT.--NIGHT  SAME HIGHWAY

     Crystal considers. Her face is unreadable...her inten-
     tions are unclear. She cuts off the road into the field
     and heads toward the campsite.

                         CUT TO:

87     EXT.--NIGHT  ALVIN'S CAMPSITE.

     Alvin barely looks up as Crystal walks into range of
     campfire light. Neither of them say anything for
     some time.

                    CRYSTAL
          I couldn't get a ride.

     Alvin nods his head. Doesn't say anything for a bit.

                    ALVIN
          Hungry?

                    CRYSTAL
          Whatya got?

                    ALVIN
          Wieners.

                    CRYSTAL
          Wieners?

                    ALVIN
          Grab a stick and cook one.

     He points to the fire. She hesitates...looks at Alvin for
     a bit longer. Alvin just keeps looking at the fire. Finally
     she looks around, finds a stick and leans toward Alvin
     to take a hot dog. She hunkers down holding the stick
     with the hot dog over the fire. She casts occasional
     glances at Alvin. More silence. She looks over to the
     mower and trailer. Her expression darkens.

                    CRYSTAL
          What a hunk of junk.

                    ALVIN
          Eat your dinner missy.

     Startled a bit at his abruptness she falls silent. She
     nibbles on her hot dog and then realizing how hungry
     she is she begins to eat faster. She polishes off
     the hot dog. Alvin notices this.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          Get yourself another.

     She's relieved at this offer and gets another hot dog,
     puts it on the stick and holds it over the fire. They
     sit, not speaking, listening to a chorus of crickets
     and peepers.

                    CRYSTAL
          How long you been out on the road?

                    ALVIN
          I've traveled just about all my life.

                    CRYSTAL
          I like being out on the road.

                    ALVIN
          It's different for a girl alone.

                    CRYSTAL
               (defensively)
          It doesn't have to be different for a girl.

     Alvin just nods his head. Doesn't speak or look at her.

                    CRYSTAL (cont'd)
          Where you from?

                    ALVIN
          Laurens.

     She nods, and sits quietly.

                    CRYSTAL
          You got a wife back there?

                    ALVIN
          Nope.

                    CRYSTAL
          Kids?

                    ALVIN
          My wife Frances brought fourteen kids
          into the world. Only seven made it....
          My daughter Rose lives with me.

     No comment for a while.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          Frances died in '81.

     Quiet for a time.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          Where's your family?

     Now she's not talking.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          You runnin' away?

     She still doesn't answer. Alvin leans back and draws
     on his cigar. He looks at the girl.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          How far along are you?

     Crystal looks away from the fire into the darkness.

                    CRYSTAL
               Five months.

     Alvin nods. More quiet. Alvin gets up, walks out of
     firelight with his grabber and comes back with a log.
     He throws it on the fire and works the embers for a
     bit.

                    ALVIN
          My daughter Rose that lives with
          me...she's what some people would call
          a little slow. But she's not. She's got a
          mind like a bear trap for facts and
          keeps everything organized around the
          house. She was a real good mom....had
          four kids.

     He pauses looking into the fire. Crystal watches him
     expectantly.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          One night.......someone else was
          watchin' the kids...

88     INT.--NIGHT  ALVIN'S KITCHEN

     We see the shot of Rose sitting alone in the kitchen
     that we saw before. She is at the kitchen table smoking
     a cigarette and thinking.

                    ALVIN
               (continuing in
               voice over)
          There was a fire. Her second boy got
          burned real bad. Rose didn't have nothin'
          to do with it.

     He pauses.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
               (continuing in
               voice over)
          ...but...because of the way Rose is... the
          state said she wasn't comp'tant to care
          for the kids and took them all away.

          Not a day passes she doesn't pine for
          those kids.

     Crystal looks away from him into the fire. He looks
     back to the fire, coughs.

                    ALVIN
          Well, I'm headin' to see my brother Lyle.

                    CRYSTAL
          Huh?

                     ALVIN
          I said I'm goin' to visit my brother Lyle
          in Mt. Zion.

                    CRYSTAL
          Where's that?

                    ALVIN
          In Wisconsin. Just over the state line.

                    CRYSTAL
               (nodding)
          Oh....Cheddar Heads.

     Alvin laughs at this and Crystal smiles, too.

                    ALVIN
          Aren't those just about the dumbest
          things you ever saw a person put on
          their head?

     She nods and laughs.

                    CRYSTAL
          I hear that's a real party place,
          Wisconsin. Guess I'll never get to find
          out.

     They sit in silence. Alvin looks away from the fire.

                    ALVIN
          I haven't seen my brother in ten years.

     Alvin picks up the hot dogs and takes one out of the
     pack. He proceeds to eat it raw.

                    CRYSTAL
          You're eatin' a raw hot dog!

                    ALVIN
               (smiling)
          I like 'em straight up.

     Crystal makes a face. Alvin munches slowly.

                    CRYSTAL
          Ten years is a long time.

     Crystal shivers with a chill. Alvin notices this.

                    ALVIN
          There's a blanket in the trailer.

     Crystal leaves firelight. She rustles about in the trailer.

                    CRYSTAL
               (offscreen)
          What the hell kind of boom box is
          this?

                    ALVIN
          Eight track stereo...watch your god-
          damned language.

                    CRYSTAL
               (offscreen)
          Are these videotapes or what?

                    ALVIN
          That's music girlie.

                    CRYSTAL
          They're huge!.....I never seen anything like
          this.

     We hear some rattling and the sound of the tape going
     in. A sweet Patsy Cline ballad floats out of the trailer
     and into the night air. Smiling, Crystal comes back
     into the light with a blanket around her shoulders.

                    CRYSTAL (cont'd)
          Figured it out.

                    ALVIN
          Good girl.

     They sit for a while and listen to the music.

                    CRYSTAL
          Your brother.

                    ALVIN
          Lyle and I had a falling out.

                    CRYSTAL
          Over what?

                    ALVIN
          I can't say as I recall.

                    CRYSTAL
          Well that's pretty stupid. You haven't
          seen him in 10 years because of a fight
          and you can't remember what the fight
          was about?

                    ALVIN
          You got some rude habits girl.

     Crystal is taken aback. She is quiet, thinking.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          Maybe I do recall.

     Quiet for a while.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          People do lots of stupid things,
          knowing they're stupid.

     He looks at her. She looks up.

                    CRYSTAL
          Sorry.

     They both stare into the fire for a while.

                    CRYSTAL
          So why are you going to see him now?

                    ALVIN
          He's sick.

     Crystal is poking the fire with the stick. Alvin picks
     up another stick and he starts poking the fire.

                    CRYSTAL
          My family hates me. They'll really hate
          me when they find out....

                    ALVIN
          You didn't tell them?

                    CRYSTAL
          No...no one knows...not even my
          boyfriend.

                    ALVIN
          Well that doesn't strike me as fair
          treatment of your people.

                    CRYSTAL
          I can take care of my own problems.

     There is a pause as they watch the fire. Then Alvin
     speaks.

                    ALVIN
          Don't let pride make you dumb. I
          should know.

     She's listening.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          They may not be happy. But not so
          much that they want to lose you...or
          your little problem.

                    CRYSTAL
          I don't know about that.

                    ALVIN
          Well a course neither do I but a warm
          bed and a roof sounds a mite better than
          this...eating hot dogs on a stick with an
          old geezer traveling on a lawn mower.

     She giggles a bit and then falls silent. After a
     moment, Alvin stirs.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          When my kids were young I played a
          game with them. I'd give each of them
          a stick. One for each of 'em, and I'd tell
          them to break it. They'd do that easy.
          Then I'd tell them to make one bundle
          of all the sticks and try to break that. A
          course they couldn't. I used to say that
          was family, that bundle.

     Crystal listens in silence.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          Sleep in the trailer if you want. I'll be
          just fine here in my chair.

                    CRYSTAL
          No, I'll be fine sleeping out here.
          Looking at the stars helps me think.

     Alvin nods. He begins to struggle to his feet. Crystal
     stands to help him. After a moment of hesitation
     Alvin accepts her arm. He stands, nods, smiles and
     moves slowly to the trailer. Crystal sits down alone
     to watch the fire. We hear the sounds of Alvin settling
     into the trailer. A bit of silence.

     Cornfields on either side of the highway. The corn is

102     EXT.--AFTERNOON  HWY 18 ON THE
     APPROACH TO WEST UNION, IOWA

     Alvin has had to pull into a busy four lane highway
     on the outskirts of a medium-sized city. There is no
      shoulder as there has been out in the country. The
     traffic is heavy. Drivers pass, some angry, some
     curious. A squad car pulls up behind and turns on its
     lights. Alvin is oblivious.  Frustrated, the POLICE
     OFFICER (young but not a rookie) gets on the
     loudspeaker...

                    WEST UNION POLICEMAN
               (very loud)
          Please pull your vehicle off the road.

     Alvin jumps and looks around. He sees the police
     car and pulls into the parking lot of a Computer
     Cosmos store. He sits patiently on the mower waiting
     for the officer. The officer approaches.

                    WEST UNION POLICEMAN
          May I see your driver's license sir?

     Alvin looks at the guy and laughs. The officer looks
     off, takes a deep breath.

                    WEST UNION POLICEMAN (cont'd)
          Have you been drinking today sir?

                    ALVIN
          No sir.

     The Cop thinks for a minute, looks at heavy traffic
     passing by, looks at Alvin, his mower and trailer.

                    WEST UNION POLICEMAN
          I'm going to have to ask you to step
          out...uh...get off of the lawn mower, sir.

     Alvin goes into the slow dismount. Officer regards
     this and reaches to assist. Alvin jerks his arm away
     from the officer.

                    WEST UNION POLICEMAN (cont'd)
          Sir, would you just walk a straight line for
          me?

     Alvin looks at his canes, looks at the officer and
     proceeds to walk a straight line.

                    WEST UNION POLICEMAN (cont'd)
          Sir, can you do that without the canes?

                    ALVIN
          Nope, I'll tip over.

     The Cop looks down.

                    WEST UNION POLICEMAN
          OK Sir. I don't believe you have been
          drinking but I'm gonna have to ask you
          to stay here at Computer Cosmos for
          another hour or so...just 'til traffic dies
          down. That would be best for you and
          the other cars. Alright?

     Alvin nods and hobbles back to the mower. He
     mounts and the cop watches this. The cop then gets
     into his squad car and takes off.

     Alvin is once again on a country road. A car passes
     him. The woman driving gawks at him as she passes.
     Moments later we hear off camera a screech of
     brakes and a heavy thud. We see Alvin react to the
     event up ahead.

105     EXT.--DUSK  RED ROAD HWY 18 ALVIN'S POV

     Up ahead a blue Japanese subcompact is parked at a
     strange angle across the shoulder of the road. The
     engine is still running. Smoke rises from the hood.
     The driver car door opens and a hefty woman with a
     bouffant hairdo, stretch pants and a tunic gets out.
     Alvin's POV slow approach. He watches her as she
     walks around to the front of the car, and looks down
     to the ground. She looks up to the heavens and then
     begins pounding her open hand on the top of the
     car hood.

                         CUT TO:

107     EXT.--DUSK  RED ROAD HWY 18

     Alvin drives up to the woman. Alvin executes his
     slow dismount. The woman glances briefly at Alvin
     but barely registers his presence because she is so
     distraught.

                    ALVIN
          Can I help Miss?

                    DEER WOMAN
          No you can't help me. Jesus, Mary and
          Joseph. No one can help me.

     Alvin moves around to the front of the car. He notes
     that the car has quite a few dents. We see that the
     woman has struck a nice eight point buck. Alvin's
     face shows relief. All the while the woman rants and
     paces.

                    DEER WOMAN (cont'd)
          I've tried driving with my lights on. I've
          tried sounding my horn. I scream out
          the window. I roll the window down
          and bang on the side of the door and
          play Public Enemy real loud...I have
          prayed to St. Francis of Assisi...St.
          Christopher too, what the hell! I have
          tried everything a person can do and
          still every week I plow into at least one
          deer. What is it?

     Alvin shakes his head. She now begins walking
     around the car, the mower and Alvin. She flails her
     arms.

                    DEER WOMAN (cont'd)
          I have hit 13 deer in seven weeks driving
          down this road mister and I have
          to drive this road every day 40 miles
          back and forth to work. I don't know
          what to do...I have to drive to work
          and I have to drive home...

     She pauses. Takes a deep breath and looks out over
     the flat landscape. She turns and pats the deer carcass.

                    DEER WOMAN (cont'd)
          He's dead.

     She starts to cry.

                    DEER WOMAN (cont'd)
          And I love deer.

     She turns and climbs back in her car. She backs up
     and sprays gravel as she accelerates away. Her front
     fender falls off and she runs over it. Alvin watches
     her drive away, then looks down at the deer.

109     EXT.--MIDDAY  HWY 18 IOWA FLATLANDS

     Alvin is driving along a particularly desolate stretch
     of road. His eye scans the horizon. He is wary. He
     slows the mower and brings it to a stop, the engine
     idling. We see Alvin's face tight. He sees something.

                         CUT TO:

110     EXT.--DAY  HWY 18 IOWA FLATLANDS ALVIN'S POV

     The Iowa horizon is a large dark mass. An occasional
     burst of light races through the black clouds. A
     breeze blows dirt along the field. Alvin's gaze searches
     for shelter. There are no farms near. He cannot
     outrace the storm. He spots a small outbuilding
     alone in the field. It is an old granary, used by
     farmers to store corn.

                         CUT TO:

111     EXT.--DAY

      Alvin turns off the highway onto a narrow rutted
     field road used only by the farmer to get to his crops.
     It is pot-holed and uneven. Alvin stops at the entry
     to the road. Moving as quickly as he can, Alvin
     secures everything that could blow away on the
     mower and the trailer. Then he mounts the mower
     and races for shelter. As he's heading to the granary
     the sky darkens dramatically and the winds hit.
     He puts his head down into the gust, holds onto his
     hat and lets out a holler, carrying all the speed a
     riding mower can. He bounces across the field and
     closes on the granary. Just as a large crack of
     lightning, rain and the full gust of wind sweep in, Alvin
     makes it into the sanctuary of the granary. A smile
     crosses his face as he revels in the race before the
     storm and the pleasure of watching the thunderstorm
     from beneath a strong roof. He shares the granary
     with a flock of pigeons who have taken shelter
     as well. Alvin sits looking out on the storm, relaxed
     and content on his perch aboard the mower.

112     EXT.--DAY  IOWA COUNTY HIGHWAY

     A warm afternoon. Alvin is making his way down a
     lonely stretch of Iowa highway. The perforated,
     yellow center line passes slowly below him. Suddenly
     Alvin hears a strange, whirring sound. A moment
     later he is startled by a strangely helmeted, goggled,
     bicyclist speeding by him.

                    CYCLIST #1
          On your left! Thank you.

                    ALVIN
          What the......?

      Another whir and another cyclist passes.

                    CYCLIST #2
          On your left. Thank you.

     And then a trio of cyclists. Another rider approaches
     pedalling a recumbent bicycle.

                    CYCLIST #3
          Comin' by on your left. Thank you!

                    ALVIN
          What in the hell....?

      Alvin pulls his rig over to the side of the road and
     watches as a large herd of cyclists, numbering more
     than a hundred riders, engulfs Alvin and his rig.
     One rider slows to gawk at Alvin and nearly causes
     an accident. Other cyclists wave as they churn by...a
     few yell greetings.

     Alvin pulls over for the evening to make camp at a
     county park. Also at the wayside are many of the
     cyclists who passed Alvin earlier. Pup tents abound.
     Riders, dressed in skin-tight, brightly colored spandex
     cycle togs, are spread about the park eating,
     drinking out of squirt bottles, stretching, hydrating,
     swapping massages and just plain preening. Alvin
     pulls into the park. Heads turn as Alvin passes
     through the crowd. A few onlookers begin clapping.
     Alvin, a bit of a showman, doffs his Stetson to even
     more applause. He pulls over to an open patch of
     campground and brings the John Deere to a halt.
     He begins his arduous dismount. A cyclist looks on.

                    CYCLIST #1
          That's the same sound we make when
          we dismount.

                         CUT TO:

115     EXT.--NIGHT  CAMPSITE

     Some cyclists, mostly younger, are gathered around
     Alvin's campfire and trailer. STEVE is in his early
     30s, an earnest, likable fellow with a neatly trimmed
     beard.

                    STEVE
          So you're averaging about twenty miles
          a day?

                    ALVIN
          'Bout that. She'll go five miles an hour
          if I push 'er. I stop when my hips start
          barkin'.

     The other talkative cyclist is RAT. He is early 20s,
     bleached cropped hair and he features a smattering
     of tattoos. He talks like a skateboarder.

                    RAT
          Wow man, five miles an hour.

     Rat looks up to see a ball flying in his direction. He
     snags it and tosses it back offscreen. He's not exactly
     paying close attention to Alvin.

                    STEVE
          So you're thinking about five weeks to
          get to your brother's place in
          Wisconsin?

                    ALVIN
          I haven't given it a schedule. That
          would sound about right.

                    RAT
          Oh man.....I could not handle five
          weeks on a lawn mower.

                    ALVIN
          And I couldn't handle sittin' on one of
          them seats for more'n an hour....if that.
          You all walk like you got a case of
          baboon butt. Seems my ride is a bit
          more comfortable.

     The cyclists laugh. Rat catches the ball again.

                    RAT
          So why the lawnmower?

     Rat tosses the ball.

                    ALVIN
          Can't drive. My eyes. Don't like other
          people drivin' me where I want to go.

                    RAT
          I can totally dig that.

     Alvin smiles and rises to get more firewood. Steve
     notices the difficulty he has walking and gets up to
     help.

                    STEVE
          Can I ask how old you are Alvin?

                    ALVIN
          Seventy-three.

                    RAT
          Oh man. Seventy-three years old. Bad
          eyes, bad hips.

                    ALVIN
          Eyes, hips....diabetes....circylation.
          Can't hardly believe it myself. I'm older
          than I ever thought I'd be.

     Two young spandex-clad women walk by. Alvin follows
     them with his eyes.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          You don't think about old age when
          you're young. Shouldn't.

                    STEVE
          When d'ya know you're getting old?

     Alvin stirs the fire.

                    ALVIN
          The first time I felt old was when I saw
          a buddy die in the war. I got old that
          minute.

     The group around the campfire is silent for a while.

                    STEVE
          There must be something good about
          getting old.

     Alvin ponders a moment, stirring the fire.

                    ALVIN
          Hard to imagine anything good about
          goin' blind and lame at the same time.
          But still...at my age...you've seen most
          everything life has to dish out. You can
          separate the wheat from the chaff. You
          know to let the small stuff fall away.

                    RAT
          Cool man.

     Rat snags the ball one more time. Someone offscreen
     yells

                    BIKE RIDER
               (offscreen)
          Sally's in my tent.

     Rat laughs and throws the ball back. Still smiling
     and looking off...

                    RAT
          What's the worst thing about being old
          Alvin?

     Alvin stirs the fire. The embers rise on the flames.
     Alvin watches the embers float up into the night sky
     and stars.

                    ALVIN
          The worst thing about being old is
          remembering when you were young.

     Again the group around the fire falls silent. They
     listen to the night sounds.

     Everyone is clearly enjoying watching the house
     burn down and the firefighters scurry about.
     DANNY RIORDAN is the owner of the house on
     whose porch everyone is gathered. He is mid-50's
     shortish and stocky, and wears khaki bermuda shorts
     and a Hawaiian print shirt. His wife DARLA
     RIORDAN is of similar build and age and has a full
     head of blond, bouffant hair. She wears white capri
     pants and a bright yellow shirt. Their friends
     JOHNNY AND JANET JOHNSON and VERLYN
     HELLER have joined them for the festivities.
     Johnny and Janet are about the same age as Danny
     and Darla and have known each other since high
     school. They all have a strangely youthful air about
     them. Johnny and Janet are both very quiet, small
     and neat. Verlyn is quite a bit older and a farmer.
     He is very tan and rugged looking. At the same time
     he bears a certain air of refinement.

                    DARLA RIORDAN
          Criminy sakes alive. You can feel the
          heat all the way over here.

                    JOHNNY JOHNSON
          Makes you appreciate what a volunteer
          fireman has to do.

                    DANNY RIORDAN
          That Rumelthanger place was an eyesore.

                    DARLA RIORDAN
          Remember old man Rumelthanger?
          What a dirty old cur...never bathed.
          The smell that came off that man. I tell
          you, it was enough to make a girl faint.

                    DANNY RIORDAN
          You always had an inclination to faint
          Darla.

     Darla blushes at this.

                    JANET
          You know. There really is something
          about watching a fire that causes you to
          sort of go off...like it's hypnotism.

                    VERLYN
          Time was when all civilization did was
          stare at the fire.

     They are happy. It's like the fourth of July and they
     are all feeling like kids watching a house burn down
     on a warm autumn afternoon. Shouts of volunteer

          Now what in the sam hill do you suppose...

     Down the hill, barely under control comes Alvin on
     the mower.

                    JOHNNY JOHNSON
          What on earth....?

                    DARLA RIORDAN
               (to Danny)
          Honey bun...is that a lawnmower?

                    JANET
          It's going too fast for a lawnmower.
          Isn't it Danny?

                    DARLA RIORDAN
          And what on earth is drivin' that
          thing?!

     Alvin is barreling down the hill, foot stamping on

          under control.

126     EXT.--DAY  ALVIN'S POV

     The road moves back and forth. Burning house fast
     approaching. Look to road bed flying by beneath the
     mower. This is much faster than Alvin or the mower
     has ever gone.

                         CUT TO:

127     EXT.--DAY  CLERMONT HILL ALVIN ON MOWER

     Alvin picks up speed. His hat threatens to blow off.
     Water is streaming from his eyes. Amazingly he
     makes it to the bottom of the hill without rolling
     the machine. As he comes to a stop the front porch
     gang reaches him.

                         CUT TO:

128     EXT.--DAY  BOTTOM OF THE HILL

     Alvin is sitting on the mower catching his breath
     and composure. He wipes the tears from his cheeks.
     Some of the volunteer fireman turn their attention
     from the burning house to the activity at the bottom
     of the hill.

                    DANNY RIORDAN
          Mister are you O.K.?

     Alvin is a little shaky. Nods in answer to Danny's
     question.

                    JOHNNY JOHNSON
          Jeez Mister you're lucky she didn't roll
          on you.

                    ALVIN
               (a little short
               of breath)
          I think the belt's shot.

                    DANNY RIORDAN
          I wouldn't be surprised. You don't have
          brakes on that trailer do you?

      Alvin shakes his head.

                     DANNY RIORDAN (cont'd)
          Mister I worked for John Deere for
          thirty years so I can tell ya you shouldn't
          be hauling a rig like that behind a
          riding mower. At least not down a hill
          like that.

     Alvin doesn't really respond. Danny softens a little.
     Considers the situation.

                    DANNY RIORDAN (cont'd)
          I'm Danny Riordan.

     He extends his hand. Alvin reaches out.

                    ALVIN
          Alvin Straight.

                    DANNY RIORDAN
          Well Alvin...let's get you and this rig off
          the road and see what the damage is.

     Alvin goes through the slow dismount under the
     watchful eyes of Darla and Janet. Danny and Verlyn
     start to push the mower and trailer and are joined
     by a couple of the volunteer fireman. Alvin brings
     up the rear, moving slowly.

                         CUT TO:

129     EXT.--DAY  BEHIND RIORDAN'S HOUSE

     Guys are pushing Alvin's rig into the backyard. They
     roll to a stop alongside a small separate garage.

                    DANNY RIORDAN
          Well let's have a look at this mower.
          This is what? '65 ...'66?

                    ALVIN
          '66.

     Danny is looking under the hood. He notices a
     small pool of oil forming under the mower.

                    DANNY RIORDAN
          Well I can tell you right now Alvin you
          won't be going anywhere tonight. Aside
          from your drive belt being busted,
          you've got transmission problems.
          Where were you hoping to get to?

                    ALVIN
          Mount Zion.

                    DARLA RIORDAN
          Mount Zion, Wisconsin? Past Prairie
          du Chien?

                    JOHNNY JOHNSON
          That's 60 more miles of hills.

                    DANNY RIORDAN
          That's across the Mississippi. What's in
          Mount Zion Alvin?

                    ALVIN
          My brother lives there.

                    JANET
          Why didn't you take your car?

                    ALVIN
          Don't have a driver's license.

                    DARLA RIORDAN
          Couldn't your brother come to visit
          you?

                    ALVIN
          He's had a bad stroke.

                    VERLYN
          Where are you coming from?

                    ALVIN
          Back a piece.

                    DANNY RIORDAN
          West Union?

                    ALVIN
           Nope.

                    JOHNNY JOHNSON
          Hawkeye?

     Alvin just shakes his head.

                    DARLA RIORDAN
          Not New Hampton. You didn't come
          that far?

      Alvin gets a small smile.

                     ALVIN
           Nope.

     Janet jumps in thinking she's got it.

                    JANET
          Mason City!

     Alvin shakes his head again.

                    VERLYN
          You've come a long way haven't you?

     Alvin looks at Verlyn and nods.

                    ALVIN
          Yes I have. From Laurens, Iowa.

                    DARLA RIORDAN
          Laurens?

                    VERLYN
          That's west of the Grotto. How long
          have you been on the road?

                    ALVIN
          What's the date today?

                    JOHNNY JOHNSON
          October 8th.

     Alvin thinks for a minute. Counts on his fingers.
     Looks up.

                    ALVIN
          5 weeks. I left Laurens on September
          5th.

                    DANNY RIORDAN
          You been bunking in that?

     Alvin points his thumb over his shoulder at the trailer.

                    ALVIN
          That's my rolling home.

     They all swing their heads and look again at the
     trailer. Darla and Janet look at each other. They
     share a "Holy Cow" look.

                    DANNY RIORDAN
          Where've you been settin' up camp?

                    ALVIN
          In the fields. I'd just pull off the road
          every evening. I don't travel at night.

                    DARLA RIORDAN
          Weren't you scared staying out there
          alone at night? There's a lot of strange
          people everywhere now.

                    ALVIN
          Ma'am, I fought in the trenches in
          World War II. Why should I be scared
          in an Iowa cornfield?

                    DANNY RIORDAN
          Well why don't you bivouac right here
          in our yard tonight? We got a bathroom
          out here in this garage you can use.

                    ALVIN
          I appreciate that. I believe this machine
          is in agreement with you.

                    ALVIN
          Sure is nice of you folks to help me with
          this.

                    DANNY RIORDAN
          Well...there's a lot of rain in the
          forecast and you don't want to be stuck in
          your trailer.

     Darla is on a stepladder attaching a red wooden
     fish to the top of the post.

                    DARLA RIORDAN
          I do a little woodwork art. I thought
          you might like some fish on your tent.

                    ALVIN

134     EXT.--DAY  RIORDAN'S BACKYARD

     Four men are standing around looking at Alvin's
     mower: Danny, Alvin and two guys from the local
     John Deere dealer. HARALD AND THORVALD OLSEN
     (they are both tall and skinny with big
     adam's apples. They have bright blue eyes and very
     ruddy red cheeks. They are prematurely bald). They
     are twin brothers and bicker like an old married
     couple. Can't agree on anything.

                    HARALD
          I tell you Thorvald it's a '65 John
          Deere 110.

                    THORVALD
          It's a '66 Harald. I fixed one just like it
          three years ago. That was a drive belt too.

                    HARALD
          '65.

                    THORVALD
          '66!

                    DANNY RIORDAN
               (to Alvin)
          They're twins. Siamese, separated at the
          opinion.

     Alvin chuckles.

                    DANNY RIORDAN (cont'd)
          It's a '66. Ask Mr. Straight.

     They both look to Alvin. Each of them still sure
     they're right.

                    ALVIN
          '66.

     Harald kicks the ground. Thorvald smirks. Blows his
     nails and shines them on his shirt.

                    DANNY RIORDAN
          So Olsens. How bad is it?

                    ALVIN
          I can't be dawdlin' here. I gotta get
          back on the road.

     The twins look at the lawn mower and then at each
     other. Thorvald turns back to Alvin who is waiting
     expectantly.

                    THORVALD
          Well you know about the transmission.
          The belt is shot, you blew a head gasget,
          you're in bad need of oil, and your
          right side tires are bald.

     Alvin takes this in.

                    ALVIN
          Is that all?

                    HARALD
          Well it wouldn't be a bad idea to
          remove the blade assembly...As best as I
          can tell ...you're not mowin' any lawns.

     The Weather Channel is on.

                    DARLA RIORDAN
          Storm rollin' in.

     Danny sits lost in thought. He doesn't react to her.

                    DANNY RIORDAN
          It's going to cost him a bundle to fix
          that mower. I don't think he's got that
          kinda money.

                    DARLA RIORDAN
          Mmmm.

                    DANNY RIORDAN
          I wouldn't drive that old thing to
          Excelsior. It's a lawn mower for god's
          sake.

                    DARLA RIORDAN
           Mmm Hmmm.

                    DANNY RIORDAN
          He was damn lucky he made it to the
          bottom of that hill. He could've been
          killed. Easily coulda' been killed.

                    DARLA RIORDAN
          Yah. Ah huh.

                     DANNY RIORDAN
          He's none too strong. Did you see how
          he can't walk without those canes?

                     DANNY RIORDAN
          The hills just get worse the closer you
          get to the Mississippi.

     Darla stops kneading her bread and smiles. With
     dough up to her elbows she walks over to Danny
     and kisses him on the forehead.

                    DARLA RIORDAN
          Go ahead and drive him honey. Mt.
          Zion can't be a half day. That's fine.

     Darla goes back to her dough as Danny keeps
     thinking.

          ....You're a good man Danny Riordan
          ....That's why I married you despite

          If it's all the same to you I was
          wondering if you have one of those phones

          Yah. Oh...your social security
          check...yah.....it's here.

                    ROSE (cont'd)
          O.K....the check......I send it to
          you......O.K.

                    ROSE (cont'd)
          Yes....I will....take it down....hold
          on......Dad.

     She puts the phone down, puts down the birdhouse
     which she has been holding through the
     conversation. She rummages through a drawer in the
     kitchen. No luck. She moves stuff around the
     countertops. No luck. She moves out of the kitchen and
     we hear her rummaging in the other room.

     Alvin is patiently sitting at a picnic table. A little
     smile comes across his face.

142     INT.--DAY  THE STRAIGHT KITCHEN

     Rose comes back into the kitchen with a big smile
     on her face holding a fat carpenter's pencil. She
     picks the phone back up.

                    ROSE (cont'd)
          O.K. Dad...I have a .......pencil. It's one
          of those ones you use when you're
          building stuff.

     She concentrates and writes for what seems a long
     time.

                    ROSE (cont'd)
          I'm going to read.....it back.

     Alvin, phone to his ear, nods several times as Rose
     haltingly reads back the address.

                    ALVIN
          That's right. I know I can count on you
          sweetheart...........I'm fine. I'm hobbled
          here but as soon as I get that check I
          can head out to Lyle's..........Are you
          O.K. there alone?...... Good, we can't

     Danny stoops and picks up the phone and money.
     He takes a look at Alvin and goes back in the house.

147     EXT.--DAY  RIORDAN'S BACKYARD.

     Alvin settles into the doorway of his trailer. Lights

148     EXT.--DAY  RIORDAN'S BACKYARD

     A Coleman cookstove is fired up and has a large pot
     of water boiling on top of it.

                         CUT TO:

149     EXT.--DAY  RIORDAN'S BACKYARD

     Alvin is stretched out on his chaise lounge. He is
     watching the water boil. Danny approaches.

                    DANNY RIORDAN
          What are ya cookin' Alvin?

                    ALVIN
          I'm making my Mexican coffee.

                    DANNY RIORDAN
          Mind if I join you?

                    ALVIN
          You'd be a guest in your own yard.

     Danny goes off, comes back with an aluminum
     folding chair and sets it up next to Alvin's chaise
     lounge.

                    DANNY RIORDAN
          I talked to the Olsen twins and they
          estimate it will cost you around
          $250.00 to get this mower running
          again.

                    ALVIN
          That's twice what it oughta be. Must be
          because they're twins.

     Danny smiles at this.

                    DANNY RIORDAN
          You know I'd be happy to drive you the
          rest of the way to Mount Zion.

     Alvin starts shaking his head.

                    DANNY RIORDAN (cont'd)
          It'd be a nice Sunday drive for me and
          Darla. We enjoy crossing the river.
          Especially with the trees in color.

                    ALVIN
          I appreciate the offer friend. I'd like to
          finish this my own way.

                    DANNY RIORDAN
          Even if you fix your mower there are
          hills bigger than Clermont's between
          here and Zion. There's no guarantee
          that your machine won't break down
          again. In fact I'll guarantee it will.
          Alvin, this machine was meant to go
          across a lawn, not the state of Iowa.

                    ALVIN
          You're a kind man talkin' to a stubborn
          man. This is a trip I'd like to finish.

     Danny resigns to Alvin's decision. Lights up a
     cigarette.

                    DANNY RIORDAN
          Well then let me give you a loan for the
          repairs.

                    ALVIN
          Well that is generous. And if I needed
          that help I'd take it. But I phoned to
          have money sent to me. I gave my
          daughter your address. I hope that's
          O.K.

     Danny knows better than to argue with the proud
     man about money.

                    DANNY RIORDAN
          Well then Alvin you'll stay right here in
          our yard until you're ready to go. We
          enjoy your company.

                    ALVIN
          I'm thankful for that.

     Danny is satisfied with this arrangement and sits
     back to enjoy the fine afternoon. They both sit and
     smoke contentedly listening to the honking of a
     passing flock of Canadian geese.

                         FADE OUT.

                         FADE IN:

150     INT.--DAY  THE RIORDAN'S YARD ALVIN'S TRAILER

     Alvin is sitting in his trailer with the door open.
     Suddenly Darla and Janet pop their heads into either
     side of the door opening and quickly pull back.

                    DARLA RIORDAN (v.o.)
          Oh excuse us Alvin. We were just
          looking for you.

                    ALVIN
               (smiling)
          Well you found me. It's alright ladies,
          I'm decent.

     The two heads pop back into either side of the
     frame of the door.

                    DARLA RIORDAN
          Well we had some brownies we thought
          you might enjoy.

     Janet extends a plate of brownies.

                    DARLA RIORDAN (cont'd)
          Janet makes the best brownies in
          Fayette county. She wins a prize for
          them every year at the county fair.

     Janet is very embarrassed by this.

                    JANET
          My mother's recipe.

                    DARLA RIORDAN
          She won't tell anyone what the secret
          ingredient is.

     Janet shakes her head. No way.

151     INT.--DAY  ALVIN'S TRAILER

     Alvin graciously accepts the plate.

                    ALVIN
          Thank you Janet. Very much. I'll let
          'em cool down a little...can't eat hot
          food. But I sure have a sweet tooth. I
          love brownies. Haven't had any since I
          went on the road. My daughter Rose
          makes a pretty good brownie.

152     EXT.--DAY  ALVIN'S TRAILER

                    JANET
          Does she live in Laurens?

                    ALVIN
          Yes. She lives with me. Just the two of
          us.

                    JANET
          Oh.

     Everyone is quiet for a bit. Alvin is holding the plate
     and the two women's heads are just hanging there.
     Darla shakes herself.

                    DARLA RIORDAN
          Well we'll be moving along. We just
          wanted to make sure you're doing O.K.
          Anything you need?

                    ALVIN
          No, thank you kindly.

                    DARLA RIORDAN
          Well don't you be afraid to ask now.

153     INT.--DAY  ALVIN'S TRAILER

                    ALVIN
          I'm doing just fine. Thanks again.

154     EXT.--DAY  ALVIN'S TRAILER

     The ladies disappear from view. Alvin moves out of
     the trailer and perches in the open door. Just then a
     pickup truck pulls into the yard and Verlyn emerges
     from the cab. As he approaches Alvin, both men
     watch the women walk into the rear of the Riordan
     house. Verlyn reaches the trailer with a smile on his
     face.

                    VERLYN
          Janet give you a plate of her brownies?

     Alvin chuckles at this and reaches behind him into
     the trailer. He pulls out the plate of brownies. He
     holds it out to Verlyn.

                    VERLYN (cont'd)
          Well how about that timing. Janet
          makes...

     Alvin joins in and they say in unison:

                    VERLYN & ALVIN
          ...the best brownies in Fayette county.

                    VERLYN (cont'd)
          She wins a prize every year at the
          county fair.

     He reaches and takes a brownie off the plate.

                    ALVIN
          Her mother's recipe.

                    VERLYN
               (munching)
          Chocolate chips.

                    ALVIN
          Huh?

                    VERLYN
          The secret ingredient...no one's
          supposed to know.....chocolate chips.

     Alvin takes a brownie too and the two men enjoy
     the delicious experience together. There is a brief,
     comfortable silence between them.

                    ALVIN
          You've had enough rain this summer,
          have ya?

                    VERLYN
          Put up third crop hay last week.

                    ALVIN
          Dairy farm?

                    VERLYN
          Beef. I got too old for milking and
          both my sons moved to Dubuque.

                    ALVIN
          I worked cattle in Montana. Back when
          it was all by horse. Before the war.

                    VERLYN
          Army?

                    ALVIN
               (looks off)
          Infantry. Third Corps.

                    VERLYN
          Under Bradley. I was Second Corps.

     Another silence. Alvin offers Verlyn a Swisher Sweet.
     Verlyn accepts.

                    VERLYN (cont'd)
          I been out on errands and I'm headin'
          for a beer. I thought you might like to
          join me.

     Alvin ponders the offer briefly.

                    ALVIN
          I don't drink no more but I'm always
          up for a change of scenery. Thanks.

     The two older men, both with troubled hips, head
     for Verlyn's truck.

          faster.

                    VERLYN
          Wait'll I get 'er over thirty.

     They both chuckle.

                         CUT TO:

158     INT.--DAY  CLERMONT BAR

     Alvin and Verlyn at the bar. The Weather Channel is
     on the television over the bar. There are some local
     farmers in the place. There is a cribbage board at a
     table. Old timers are slapping cards on the table.
     Verlyn is drinking beer. Alvin is having a glass of
     milk.

                    VERLYN
          I can still have my beer but I can't
          drink the brown stuff anymore.

     Alvin nods with understanding at this comment.

                    ALVIN
          I picked up a mournful taste for liquor
          in France.
               (shaking his head)
          When I came back I couldn't drink
          enough of it. I wasn't worth a stick of
          stove wood. Mean. A preacher helped
          put some distance between me and the
          bottle. He helped me see that I was
          drinkin' because some of the sights I
          was still seein' from over there.

     Verlyn nods. Takes a sip of beer. Looks straight
     ahead at the back bar.

                    VERLYN
          Lot of men came back drinking hard.
          My brother Dewey did that. Spent
          most of his adult life drinking from
          noon on. He was an awful sweet drunk
          though.

     Alvin takes this in. Nods quietly.

                    ALVIN
          Everyone trying to forget. I can see it
          still in a man right away.

     Verlyn looks quickly at Alvin.

                    VERLYN
          Yup.

                    ALVIN
          It was one hard day after another hard
          day all strung together.

                    VERLYN
          Yeah.

     The bartender comes over. Verlyn orders another.
     The bartender looks to Alvin who is nursing his
     glass of milk.

                    ALVIN
          No, I'm good thanks.

     The bartender moves down the bar. Alvin and
     Verlyn sit in silence. Verlyn is peeling the label off
     of his long neck bottle. He is really concentrating on
     this process.

                    VERLYN
          There was this one time...We were just
          ...waiting on our first warm meal in ten
          days.

      Verlyn looks up quickly at Alvin in the mirror on
     the back bar to see how he's reacting. Alvin just
     looks into his milk glass but doesn't stop him.

                    VERLYN (cont'd)
          ...We thought we'd seen the worst.
          They hadn't given us much trouble
          from the air.

     Verlyn takes another drink of beer. He stops working
     on the label. He looks straight ahead at the back bar.

                    VERLYN (cont'd)
          I was on a rise with the quartermaster
          working on more coffee for me and my
          buddies. A stray Focke-Wolf comes
          over the treetops and drops an incendiary
          right on the mess tent...all my
          buddies...

          The Kraut banks right in front of me
          on that hill and......I can (he pauses and
          the memory becomes the present) see
          the Iron Cross...(suddenly unable to
          speak...he tries in a choked
          voice)....right in front of me (composes
          himself, shaking his head)....

     There is silence. Alvin gives Verlyn time to set
     himself.

                    VERLYN (cont'd)
          Then I look...I couldn't tell which of
          my buddies it was burnin' up down
          there.

     Verlyn can barely finish his story. Alvin is very still
     and quiet. Verlyn has collected himself and looks
     quietly to the mirror of the back bar.

                    VERLYN (cont'd)
          "...Swept with confused alarms of
          struggle and flight,

          Where ignorant armies clash by night."

     Verlyn looks down, slightly embarrassed at his
     speech. Alvin thinks about what he's heard. He starts
     with his own story.

                    ALVIN
          There is a thing I can't let loose..... All
          my buddies faces are still young...

          The spirit of the thing is that the more
          years I have... the more they lost.
          And... it's not always a buddy's face I'm
          seein'. Sometimes it's a German face. By
          the end we were shooting moon-faced
          boys....

     Alvin takes a sip of milk and draws a deep breath.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          I was a sniper. The way I grew up...you
          learn how to shoot huntin' for food.

     Alvin stops. He's not sure if he's going to continue.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          They'd post me up front, damn near
          ahead of the line. I'd sit still
          forever.

          Amazin' thing what you can see just sittin'.
          I'd look for the officers...or their
          radio guy or artillery spotter...
          Sometimes I'd sight a gun nest by the
          smoke and fire into that. Sometimes it
          was just movement in the woods.

     Alvin pauses.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          We had a scout. Small guy. Name of
          Kotz. He was a Polish fella from
          Milwaukee. He would always take
          recon and he was good. We went by his
          word and he saved our skins more'n
          once. A short fella.

     Alvin sets both hands palm down on the bar. He
     looks hard at his hands.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          We had broken out of the
          hedgerows...made a run across the open
          when we come upon a woods an' started
          drawin' fire. I took my usual spot. I
          saw some movement real slow like. I
          waited for ten minutes and it moved
          again. I fired. The movement stopped.
          We found Kotz the next day. Head
          shot. He had been movin' back toward
          our lines. Everyone in the unit thought
          he was taken by a German
          sniper...everyone all these years.
          Everyone but me.

     Alvin and Verlyn sit real quiet for a while. Verlyn

162     EXT.--DAY  DANNY RIORDAN'S BACKYARD

     Danny and the two Olsen brothers are fixing the
     mower. Alvin looks on.

                    HARALD
          You can work all day and you won't get
          that piece off with that wrench.

                    THORVALD
               (from beneath the mower)
          Danny, did you hear me ask
          Wisenheimer there for his advice on
          how to fix a riding mower?

                    HARALD
          Fine. Then we'll all just stand here and
          wait for Mr. Wizard to finish...Anyone
          got a deck a cards?

                    THORVALD
               (still beneath)
          Very funny Harald. If it was you
          underneath here we could all go home
          and wait for winter. Then we could just
          put the snowplow on this rig.

                    DANNY RIORDAN
          Jeez you two can bitch. I heard you
          about killed each other last week over
          horseshoes at the Dew Drop.

     Harald gets a mad look on his face.

                    THORVALD
               (up from beneath)
          See Harald...brainiac...I got the mower
          assembly free with this little old wrench
          here you said wouldn't work...Well I'd
          say it worked pretty good, wouldn't
          you? Help me slide'er out here and we
          can settle up.

     They slide out the mower assembly. Thorvald steps
     back, wiping the oil off his hands. Harald is pulling
     out the bill. He reads off of it.

                    HARALD
          I got the labor and parts coming to
          $247.80.

     He hands the bill to Alvin. Alvin scans it. He looks
     up at them.

                    ALVIN
          That's a little heavy for light work.

     The Olsen brothers are a little taken aback by this.
     Alvin moves over to the mower and starts a slow circle
     around it.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          Now I got old man's eyes...

     He reaches down and runs his hand along the treads
     of the tires.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          ...but I was noticin' these new tires......

     Danny is starting to enjoy himself. He crosses his
     arms and smiles at the Olsens.

                    HARALD
          Well, now we did take them off of a
          resell, but the treads are good.

     Alvin, still caressing the treads gives him a long look
     from under the brim of his Stetson.

                    ALVIN
          Friend, are you chargin' me good or are
          you chargin' me new?

                    HARALD
          Uh, (turns to his brother) Thorvald?

                    THORVALD
          Well I guess we can make an adjustment
          there.

     Danny pulls up a lawn chair and lights a cigarette.
     Hunkers down for the entertainment.

                    ALVIN
          I figure that adjustment to be about
          $30.00? Is that what your pencil's
          sayin'?

                    DANNY RIORDAN
          Sounds right to me.

     The twins give Danny a dirty look.

                    ALVIN
          Now about that labor. I'm agreeable
          that you boys have put some real time
          in on this job. But a man's gotta ask
          when he workin with twins, especially a
          bickerin' pair, how much workin' was
          fightin'.

                    DANNY RIORDAN
          You got that right.

                    THORVALD AND HARALD
               (in unison)
          Shut up Danny.

                    ALVIN
          If I were to judge from the joyous affair
          I've seen today I would calculate a 20%
          discount on the labor charge.

     Thorvald and Harald exchange a look

                    THORVALD
          Anything else mister.

                    ALVIN
          Now I'm not from these parts exactly
          but where I come from this is a mighty
          rich charge on a can of Iowa oil.

     Thorvald and Harald can not believe this old fart.

                    THORVALD
          Take the oil. No charge.

                    ALVIN
          Well that's a splendid offer that I very
          much appreciate. Now what's your tally?

     Danny turns grinning to the twins. They are slightly
     befuddled.

                    HARALD
          Uh...uh.

     Looking at Thorvald who shrugs.

                    HARALD (cont'd)
          ...uh...$180.00 even?

                    ALVIN
          Done.

     Sticks out his hand which each of the twins takes
     in confusion. Alvin brings out the money, and pays
     the twins. They see that he has 4 c-notes in his
     wallet.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          Now it's thanks to you boys that I can
          get back on the road.

     Alvin stuffs the change in his wallet and puts the
     wallet back in his pocket.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          I drove this rig across Iowa. I'm hopin'
          it'll hold into Wisconsin...

     Alvin looks up at them.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          ...that's where my brother lives. Haven't
          seen him in ten years.

     Alvin looks at the Olsen brothers. They squirm
     under his gaze.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          No man knows your life better than a
          brother near your age. He can know
          who, and what you are best than most
          anyone on the earth.

     He stops for a moment. Looks hard at the Olsens.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          My brother and I said some unforgivable
          things last time we were together. I
          want to put those times behind us.
          This trip is just one hard swallow of
          pride. I'm only hopin' I'm not too late.

     They make to gather their tools and leave.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          A brother's a brother.

     Danny smiles at this. The Olsens move to get out of
     there as fast as they can.

                         CUT TO:

163     EXT.--NIGHT  DANNY RIORDAN'S BACK YARD.

     Alvin is cooking up a large jug of water for coffee.
     Danny is sitting in the chair watching Alvin and
     smoking a cigarette. He has come to enjoy his time
     out in the backyard with Alvin.

                    DANNY RIORDAN
          I've gotta tell you Alvin that I'm
          worried about you. About you...about your
          trip on that mower.

                    ALVIN
          Not to worry. Me and my machine are
          in splendid form after our stay here.

                    DANNY RIORDAN
          You're sure are you Alvin?

      Alvin just nods. A somewhat awkward silence settles
     on the scene.

                    DANNY RIORDAN (cont'd)
          Well.

     Little more silence. Danny puts out his cigarette.

                    DANNY RIORDAN (cont'd)
          I guess I'll be turning in. See you in the
          morning then before you go.

                    ALVIN
          I'll be traveling plenty early.

     Alvin takes off his hat and stands directly in front of
     Danny.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          I want to thank you for your kindness
          to a stranger.

     Danny stands up from his chair and puts out his
     hand.

                    DANNY RIORDAN
          It has been a genuine pleasure having
          you here Alvin. Write to us sometime.

     Alvin takes his hand in a firm shake.

164     EXT.--EARLY MORNING  DANNY RIORDAN'S BACKYARD

     Tight on door of trailer closing. Alvin comes

165     EXT.--SUNRISE  DANNY RIORDAN'S HOUSE

     Danny is standing at a window unseen by Alvin. He
     has been watching Alvin's preparations from inside
     the house, sensing Alvin's reluctance for goodbyes.
     Alvin pulls out onto the road.

                         CUT TO:

166     EXT.--SUNRISE  RIORDAN'S FRONT PORCH

     Danny steps out onto the porch, holding a coffee

     Shot of empty road, top of the hill. The trees on
     either side of the road are in full fall color. Alvin
     and the mower rise into view. Then he stops and
     eyes the steep downhill grade. He sets his hat and
     starts down.

169     EXT.--DAY  ANOTHER HILL JUST WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI

     Alvin again crests a hill. This one a bit bigger. Again

172     EXT.--DAY  SAME HILL TOP  ALVIN'S POV.

      The beautiful, broad Mississippi stretches out before
     him. The hills are in full autumn foliage. There is
     river as far as the eye can see. It is dotted with boats
     and barges. Directly across from Alvin, the
     Wisconsin River flows into the Mississippi... the sun
     glints off their surface where they join. Alvin secures
     his hat and gets back out on the road.

176     EXT.--DAY  HIGHWAY LEADING TO THE BRIDGE.

     As he approaches the bridge over the river, Alvin has
     to pull more off the shoulder and into the slow lane
     of traffic. He begins his crossing.

                         CUT TO:

177     EXT.--DAY  HIGH ANGLE SHOT OF ALVIN ON BRIDGE

      Alvin is tooling along in the slow lane. The landscape
     around the bridge is breathtaking. Cars and
     trucks pass him. A car tailgates him. Traffic behind
     him begins to build.

178     EXT.--DAY  MISSISSIPPI BRIDGE

     Alvin riding on his mower, enjoying the view at his
     nice, slow pace. The mower's pace allows him to
     enjoy the scene. People in cars and trucks pass and
     gawk in disbelief. A few are irritated. Some kids take
     his picture. One child motions for him to blow his
     air horn.

179     EXT.--DAY  HIGH ANGLE SHOT OF ALVIN ON BRIDGE

     Alvin at mid-point of the span. The number of cars
     backed up behind him has increased. The flow of
     cars in adjacent lane become affected by the gawkers.
     Alvin has no idea that he is now a one man traffic
     jam.

180     EXT.--DAY  MISSISSIPPI

     Alvin on his mower. He is oblivious to the traffic
     behind him. He is really enjoying the view of the
     Mississippi.

181     EXT.--DAY  HIGH ANGLE OF ALVIN ON BRIDGE

     Now there is a serious back up behind Alvin. He is
     3/4 of the way across the bridge and cars are backed
     up 1/2 way back.

182     EXT.--DAY  ALVIN'S POV

     Alvin scans the river but as his view moves past the
     "WELCOME TO WISCONSIN" sign...

183     EXT.--DAY  ALVIN'S FACE TIGHT

     ...his expression changes from blissful tourist to
     concerned motorist.

184     EXT.--DAY  ALVIN POV

     Next to the welcome sign Alvin's sees a Prairie du
     Chien police officer leaning against his squad, lights
     revolving.

185     EXT.--DAY  PRAIRIE DU CHIEN, WISCONSIN

     As Alvin approaches, the officer waves him to the side
     of the road. Alvin slows to a stop along the shoulder.
     The police officer begins to direct the cars past
     around Alvin, moving the gawkers along. He begins
     to converse with Alvin over his shoulder as he waves.

                    PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP
          Sir, are you aware of the congestion you
          caused on the bridge just now?

                    ALVIN
          I wasn't.

                    PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP
          I am assuming sir that you have the
          appropriate registration to operate a
          Slow Moving Vehicle. Am I correct?

                    ALVIN
          Yes sir.

                    PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP
          And where are you headed today?

                    ALVIN
          Mt. Zion.

     At this the police officer stops directing traffic and
     walks over to Alvin with an incredulous look on his
     face.

                    PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP
          You are going to drive that to Mt.
          Zion? The Mt. Zion by Boscobel?

                    ALVIN
          Boscobel?

                    PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP
          The Mt. Zion by Blue River?
          That Mt. Zion?

                    ALVIN
          That Mt. Zion ...yes.

                    PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP
          May I see some identification please?

     Alvin extracts his wallet and chain and hands over
     an ID.

                    PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP (cont'd)
          It says here you're from Laurens. That
          is...?

                    ALVIN
          A bit west of the Grotto.

                    PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP
          And you've made it to Wisconsin with
          this setup?

                    ALVIN
          I have.

     The cop stands back and takes in the whole rig:
     lawnmower, plywood trailer, antlers.

                    PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP
               (amazed)
          It says here Mr. Straight that you are 73
          years old. How long have you been on
          the road from Laurens?

                    ALVIN
          Goin' on six weeks.

                    PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP
          And what's your business in Mt. Zion?

                    ALVIN
          My brother is sick.

     The cop considers this for a moment.

                    PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP
          Well Mr. Straight, we've got a problem
          here. All of this traffic that you've
          managed to stop runs right on through
          downtown Prairie du Chien. I'd like
          you to take the side streets.

                    ALVIN
          Well I'd like to accommodate you
          but...I'm afraid I'm not familiar with
          the streets in this town.

                    PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP
          You stay right here Mr. Straight. Don't
          move.

     Alvin nods. The officer walks back to his squad and
     begins talking in the radio. Alvin sits and watches
     the river and the traffic. A car goes by and a dog
     barks at him from a window. Little children stare at
     him as they pass. The officer returns. He notices
     again the deer antlers mounted on the trailer.

                    PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP (cont'd)
          Do you have a hunting license?

     Alvin turns and sees he's looking at the antlers.

                    ALVIN
          That was a road kill.

     Another Prairie du Chien squad car pulls up lights
     flashing.

                    PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP
          Mr. Straight, I'd like you to follow me.

                    ALVIN
          Are you arresting me?

                    PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP
          No sir....we're escorting you.

     The two squads bracket Alvin and move out into
     traffic. The caravan drives through the side streets of
     town. The squad cars have their red lights flashing.
     A state patrol car joins the procession. Locals look
     on in confusion and amusement. They wave and
     Alvin, a regular parade marshall, waves back.

                         CUT TO:

186     EXT.--DAY  EASTERN EDGE OF PRAIRIE DU CHIEN

     The lead police car stops. The other cars wave and
     peel away. The officer from the bridge walks over to
     Alvin on the mower.

                    PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP
          You take this up as far as 61, head
          north and it'll take you straight into
          Mt. Zion. Have a safe journey, Mr.
          Straight.

                    ALVIN
          Thank you for the grand parade.

                    PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP
          Our privilege sir.

     He turns to walk away, then looks back.

                    PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP (cont'd)
          Must've been one slow buck.

     Alvin sits grinning on his rig, his head framed by the
     buck's antlers.

     small country church and cemetery.

187     EXT.--NIGHT  ALVIN'S CAMPSITE

      Alvin sits in his chaise by the campfire. A train whistle
     sounds in the distance. Alvin looks up, and looks
     into the sky.

188     EXT.--NIGHT  ALVIN'S POV

     Stars in the cool autumn sky with a crescent moon.
     The train whistle blows again.

189     EXT.--NIGHT

      Alvin looks off in the direction of the sound. His
     trip is nearing an end. He looks around at his
     surroundings.

190     EXT.--NIGHT  ALVIN'S POV

     He is camped alongside a small country church and
     cemetery. A simple iron archway guards the cemetery.
     The back door of the church opens and a swath
     of light cuts into the cemetery. A PRIEST in layman's
     clothes comes out carrying a plate and
     approaches Alvin.

                    PRIEST
          I noticed your campfire. I brought you
          some dinner...meat loaf and potatoes.

     He holds the plate out to Alvin. Alvin hesitates and
     then reaches out and takes the plate.

                    ALVIN
          I thank you kindly. Hope you don't
          mind my trespassin'.

                    PRIEST
          Not at all. You've made a fine choice.
          You're camped next to one of the oldest
          cemeteries in the midwest. French
          Catholic trappers.

                    ALVIN
          Marquette's party?

                    PRIEST
               (nodding)
          Two of his men.

     Alvin reflects on this. He motions for the priest to
     sit down by the fire. The priest does so.

                    PRIEST (cont'd)
               (hesitantly)
          I couldn't help but notice your rather
          unusual mode of transport.

                    ALVIN
               (shakes his head
               and smiles)
          Well you wouldn't be the first person to
          say so Padre.

     The priest doesn't say anything...he waits on Alvin.
     Finally...

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
               (he's ready to stop
               explaining himself
               to people)
          I can't see good enough to drive a car, I
          don't like someone else drivin' my bus
          and I got to get to my brother's place.

                    PRIEST
          Fair enough. How far have you traveled?

                    ALVIN
          Well now this vehicle doesn't sport an
          odometer so I couldn't exactly say...but
          I been on the road since September
           5th.

                    PRIEST
          But we're October 15th. Where in
          heaven's name did you start out?

                    ALVIN
          Back in north central Iowa. Laurens,
          Iowa.

                    PRIEST
          That must be over 300 miles from
          here!

                    ALVIN
          I reckon that's not a bad guess.

     The priest gets up and walks over to Alvin's mower
     and trailer. He walks around it real slow...one full
     circle.  He comes back and sits down by the fire. He
     looks at Alvin for a bit.

                    PRIEST
          Well I would guess that you are on a
          mission.

     This sets Alvin to thinking. He nods to himself.

                    ALVIN
          You know I wouldna ever thought of it
          that way but I guess you could say
          that's exactly what I'm doin'.

                    PRIEST
          You say you've got to see your brother.
          Where is he?

                    ALVIN
          So close I can practically feel him...
          Mt. Zion.

                    PRIEST
          What's his name?

                    ALVIN
          Lyle Straight.

                    PRIEST
          That the fellow had a stroke some weeks
          ago?

                    ALVIN
          That's right. You know him?

                    PRIEST
          Well I do some work over at the hospital
          in Boscobel and I remember him
          coming in. He caught my attention
          because he lives in my parish.

                    ALVIN
          He's Baptist.

                    PRIEST
          I believe he told me that. He told me a
          few things as a matter of fact. Didn't
          mention having a brother though.

     Alvin looks up to the sky.

                    ALVIN
          Don't think we've either of us had a
          brother for some time now. I'm hopin'
          to fix that...

     Alvin pauses for a moment.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          So you saw him? ...He's O.K. then?

                    PRIEST
          I only saw him that once...never heard
          anything more.

     There is a pause in the talk. Alvin takes in the scene.

                         CUT TO:

191     EXT.--NIGHT SKY

     Alvin's POV of the crescent moon, the stars and
     down to the church and the cemetery. The priest
     waits for him to go on. Night sounds, train whistles.

                    ALVIN
          Lyle and I grew up close as brothers
          could be. We were raised on a farm up
          in Moorhead, Minnesota. Worked so
          hard...my ma and pa pretty much
          killed themselves trying to make that
          farm work.

     Alvin shakes his head at the sorrow of this memory.
     He takes out a cigar and lights it. The priest patiently
     waits on him to continue.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          Me and Lyle...we made games out of
          our chores. A day's work'd go quicker
          when it was just the two of us. We'd
          make up different races and wagers just
          to get our mind off the cold...Christ it
          was cold....

     He looks quickly to the priest.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          'Scuse me Padre.

     The priest nods tolerantly. He waits for Alvin to
     continue.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          He and I used to sleep out in the yard
          every summer night it wasn't pouring.
          After nine months of winter we couldn't
          get enough of summer. We'd bunk
          down as soon as the sun went down
          and lie there talkin' ourselves to sleep.
          Talk about the stars...and other planets,
          whether there might be other people
          like us out there, 'bout all the places we
          wanted to go...made our trials seem
          smaller. We pretty much talked each
          other through growin' up.

     Alvin looks up to the sky.

                         CUT TO:

192     EXT.--NIGHT  ALVIN'S POV OF THE NIGHT

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
               (voice over)
          Funny but lookin' up at these stars
          tonight and feelin' him so close...makes
          me feel I'm right back there again. All
          those years ago.

     They are both quiet for a bit...we stay on the night
     sky.

                    PRIEST
               (voice over)
          What happened between you two?

                         CUT TO:

193     EXT.--NIGHT  CAMPSITE

     Alvin looks back down to the fire.

                    ALVIN
          Well that's a story old as the
          bible...Cain and Abel. Anger...vanity
          ...mix those things up with liquor and
          you get two brothers not talkin' for ten
          years....

     Alvin shakes his head.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          It doesn't really matter anymore.

     He's quiet for a while.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
          I've lived on this earth for 73 years. I'm
           a humble man in the world but my life
          is so full that from where I sit now I'll
          be damned if I know how I did it
          all...growin' up on a hardscrabble
          farm...then went to war...
               (he shakes his head
               at these painful
               memories)
          ...God help us.
               (he pauses and
               takes a breath)
          I had seven children. We lived in every
          part of this beautiful country...I loved a
          woman for 40 years...and then she
          died.

     He has to stop for a while.

     The priest is looking into the fire. He gives Alvin all
     the time he needs.

                    ALVIN (cont'd)
               (he takes a breath)
          I've got two daughters...one we lost
          track of back in '74...don't even know
          if she's alive. Got in with a mean fella.
               (another painful pause.)
          So...whatever it was made me and Lyle
          so mad doesn't matter to me now...I
          want to make peace...I want to sit with
          him again and look up at all the stars.

     The priest looks over at Alvin. Alvin looks up and
     becomes embarrassed.

                    PRIEST
          Well sir, I say amen to that.

194     EXT.--NIGHT  ALVIN'S CAMPSITE

     The hilltop wide under the stars. The fire glows
     small in the frame. The firelight's flickering
     illumination of Alvin, the priest, the Church and the
     cemetery.

                         SLOW FADE TO BLACK.

195     EXT.--DAY  WESTERN WISCONSIN

     Alvin is driving through rolling Wisconsin farmland
     dotted with dairy farms and red barns. He sees a

          First frost of the season is expected for

198     INT.--DAY  MT. ZION BAR

      Something out the window catches the bartender's
     eye. He glances out and his expression changes to
     one of disbelief.

                    MT. ZION BARTENDER
          What the....

     He gets up off his stool and walks over to the window
     for a closer look.

                    MT. ZION BARTENDER (cont'd)
               ...hell?

199     INT.--DAY  MT. ZION BAR/GAS STATION

     Through the window we see Alvin hauling up the
     hill approaching the bar.

200     EXT.--DAY  MT. ZION BAR GAS PUMP

     Alvin arrives at the top of the hill and stops at the
     gas pumps. Alvin executes his usual laborious dismount
     and enters the bar.

201     INT.--DAY  THE MT. ZION BAR

     Alvin crosses the bar and perches atop a bar stool.
     He sets his canes against the bar rail and addresses
     the bartender.

                    ALVIN
          I haven't had a drink in years but I
          believe I'll have a cold beer right now.

                    MT. ZION BARTENDER
          What flavor?

                    ALVIN
          What does a Miller Lite taste like?

     The bartender places a bottle in front of Alvin.

                    MT. ZION BARTENDER
          Interesting rig you got out there. Make
          it up the hill OK?

                    ALVIN
          That one and about 200 others.

                    MT. ZION BARTENDER
          How far'd you come?

                    ALVIN
          Iowa. Headin' to Lyle Straight's place.

                    MT. ZION BARTENDER
          Iowa?...by God you must be thirsty.

                    ALVIN
          One'll do thank you. Can you point
          me to Lyle's place? I don't quite recall
          the way...it's been an awful long time
          since I seen him.

     Alvin starts drinking the beer in short order.

                    MT. ZION BARTENDER
          Cross 61 there on W. Take W to Weed
          Road and then take Weed on down to
          Remington. Remington drops down
          onto S...that's the county trunk by
          Frankie Schwartz's farm. On your right
          would be Lyle's place...if he's even
          there.  I heard he's had a bad stroke...if
          you see him, tell him Micky O'Connor
          tells him to get better quick.

     Alvin finishes off the beer, gets up and heads out of
     bar. MARTHA, the bartender's wife arrives after
     Alvin's exit. She peers out the window. Then turns
     to the bartender.

                    MARTHA
          I believe that would be a '66.

204     EXT.--DAY  WEED ROAD ALVIN TIGHT

      Alvin knows that he is near the end of his journey.
     Then a look crosses his face. We hear the engine
     cough. Then with a puff of black smoke, the mower
     dies. Alvin sits alone on the dirt road.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

206     EXT.--DAY  WEED ROAD EVEN LATER THAT SAME DAY

     Alvin still sitting. We hear the off camera sound of a
     tractor. Around the bend of the dirt road comes a
     big John Deere farm tractor.

                         CUT TO:

207     EXT.--DAY  DIRT ROAD WIDE

     The farmer stops and converses with Alvin. He is
     offering to haul Alvin. Alvin tries the mower again
     and to his surprise it starts. The farmer climbs on his
     tractor and proceeds down the road in front of
     Alvin. They continue like this approaching Lyle's
     place. Alvin turns off into Lyle's yard and the tractor
     keeps moving off. Alvin cuts his engine and the
     sound of the tractor fades off.

          Is that you Alvin?

      We hear a rhythmic bumping noise from inside.

                         CUT TO:

210     EXT.--MAGIC HOUR  LYLE'S YARD

     Alvin starts moving toward the front porch. Lyle
     comes out the front door using a walker. It makes
     the bumping noise. As Alvin climbs the few steps he
     and Lyle stand very close and take a good look at
     each other...at the old men they have become.

                    LYLE
          Sit yourself down Alvin.

     They move slowly to the two chairs set up on the
     porch. They are situated about five feet apart on
     either side of the screen door. Lyle is on the right
     and Alvin on the left.

                         CUT TO:

     Lyle looking out at the lawnmower and trailer in the
     yard.

          Did you ride that thing all the way here
          to see me?

     Alvin nodding his head.

                    ALVIN

     We stay on Alvin's face for a while.

      Close shot of Lyle. He is crying.

                         CUT TO:
