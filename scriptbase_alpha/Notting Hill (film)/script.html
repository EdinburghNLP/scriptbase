<b>  N O T T I N G   H I L L
</b>
  Screenplay by Richard Curtis

<b>  --------------------------------------------------------------
</b>

  Title

<b>  EXT. VARIOUS DAYS
</b>
  'She' plays through the credits.

  Exquisite footage of Anna Scott -- the great movie star of our
  time -- an ideal -- the perfect star and woman -- her life full of
  glamour and sophistication and mystery.

<b>  EXT. STREET - DAY
</b>
  Mix through to William, 35, relaxed, pleasant, informal.  We
  follow him as he walks down Portobello Road, carrying a load of
  bread.  It is spring.

<b>        WILLIAM (V.O.)
</b>    Of course, I've seen her films and
    always thought she was, well,
    fabulous -- but, you know,
    million miles from the world I live
    in.  Which is here -- Notting Hill
    -- not a bad place to be...

<b>  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY
</b>
  It's a full fruit market day.

<b>        WILLIAM (V.O.)
</b>    There's the market on weekdays,
    selling every fruit and vegetable
    known to man...

<b>  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY
</b>
  A man in denims exits the tattoo studio.

<b>        WILLIAM (V.O.)
</b>    The tattoo parlour -- with a guy
    outside who got drunk and now can't
    remember why he chose 'I Love Ken'...

<b>  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY
</b>
<b>        WILLIAM (V.O.)
</b>    The racial hair-dressers where
    everyone comes out looking like the
    Cookie Monster, whether they like
    it or not...

  Sure enough, a girl exits with a huge threaded blue bouffant.

<b>  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - SATURDAY
</b>
<b>        WILLIAM (V.O.)
</b>    Then suddenly it's the weekend, and
    from break of day, hundreds of stalls
    appears out of nowhere, filling
    Portobello Road right up to Notting
    Hill Gate...

  A frantic crowded Portobello market.

<b>        WILLIAM (V.O.)
</b>    ... and thousands of people buy
    millions of antiques, some genuine...

  The camera finally settles on a stall selling beautiful stained
  glass windows of various sizes, some featuring biblical scenes
  and saints.

<b>        WILLIAM (V.O.)
</b>    ... and some not so genuine.

<b>  EXT. GOLBORNE ROAD - DAY
</b>
<b>        WILLIAM (V.O.)
</b>    And what's great is that lots of
    friends have ended up in this part of
    London -- that's Tony, architect
    turned chef, who recently invested
    all the money he ever earned in a new
    restaurant...

  Shot of Tony proudly setting out a board outside his restaurant,
  the sign still being painted.  He receives and approves a huge
  fresh salmon.

<b>  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY
</b>
<b>        WILLIAM (V.O.)
</b>    So this is where I spend my days
    and years -- in this small village in
    the middle of a city -- in a house
    with a blue door that my wife and I
    bought together... before she left
    me for a man who looked like Harrison
    Ford, only even handsomer...

  We arrive outside his blue-doored house just off Portobello.

<b>        WILLIAM (V.O.)
</b>    ... and where I now lead a strange
    half-life with a lodger called...

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Spike!

  The house has far too many things in it.  Definitely two-
  bachelor flat.

  Spike appears.  An unusual looking fellow.  He has unusual
  hair, unusual facial hair and an unusual Welsh accent: very
  white, as though his flesh has never seen the sun.  He wears
  only shorts.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me
    with an incredibly important
    decision, could you?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    This is important in comparison to,
    let's say, whether they should
    cancel third world debt?

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    That's right -- I'm at last going out
    on a date with the great Janine and I
    just want to be sure I've picked the
    right t-shirt.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    What are the choices?

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Well... wait for it...
      (He pulls on a t-shirt)
    First there's this one...

  The t-shirt is white with a horrible looking plastic alien
  coming out of it, jaws open, blood everywhere.  It says 'I Love
  Blood.'

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Yes -- might make it hard to strike a
    really romantic note.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Point taken.

  He heads back up the stairs... talks as he changes...

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    I suspect you'll prefer the next one.

  And he re-enters in a white t-shirt, with a large arrow,
  pointing down to his flies, saying, 'Get It Here.'

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Cool, huh?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Yes -- she might think you don't have
    true love on your mind.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Wouldn't want that...
      (and back up he goes)
    Okay -- just one more.

  He comes down wearing it.  Lots of hearts, saying, 'You're the
  most beautiful woman in the world.'

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Well, yes, that's perfect. Well
    done.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Good luck.

  Spike turns and walks upstairs proudly.  Revealing that on the
  back of the t-shirt, also printed in big letters, is written
  'Fancy a fuck?'

<b>  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY
</b>
<b>        WILLIAM (V.O.)
</b>    And so it was just another hopeless
    Wednesday, as I set off through the
    market to work, little suspecting
    that this was the day which would
    change my life forever.  This is
    work, by the way, my little travel
    book shop...

  A small unpretentious store... named 'The Travel Book Co.'

<b>        WILLIAM (V.O.)
</b>    ... which, well, sells travel books
    -- and, to be frank with you, doesn't
    always sell many of those.

  William enters.

<b>  INT. THE BOOKSHOP - DAY
</b>
  It is a small shop, slightly chaotic, bookshelves everywhere,
  with little secret bits round corners with even more books.
  Martin, William's sole employee, is waiting enthusiastically.
  He is very keen, an uncrushable optimist.  Perhaps without
  cause.  A few seconds later, William stands gloomily behind the
  desk.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Classic.  Absolutely classic.
    Profit from major sales push -- minus
    £347.

<b>        MARTIN
</b>    Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the
    pain.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Yes, better get me a half.  All I can
    afford.

<b>        MARIN
</b>    I get your logic.  Demi-capu coming up.

  He salutes and bolts out the door -- as he does, a woman walks in.
  We only just glimpse her.

  Cut to William working.  He looks up casually.  And sees
  something.  His reaction is hard to read.  After a pause...

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Can I help you?

  It is Anna Scott, the biggest movie star in the world -- here --
  in his shop.  The most divine, subtle, beautiful woman on earth.
  When she speaks she is very self-assured and self-contained.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    No, thanks.  I'll just look around.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Fine.

  She wanders over to a shelf as he watches her -- and picks out a
  quite smart coffee table book.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    That book's really not good -- just
    in case, you know, browsing turned to
    buying.  You'd be wasting your money.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Really?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Yes.  This one though is... very
    good.

  He picks up a book on the counter.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    I think the man who wrote it has
    actually been to Turkey, which helps.
    There's also a very amusing incident
    with a kebab.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Thanks.  I'll think about it.

  William suddenly spies something odd on the small TV monitor
  beside him.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    If you could just give me a second.

  Her eyes follow him as he moves toward the back of the shop and
  approaches a man in slightly ill-fitting clothes.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Excuse me.

<b>        THIEF
</b>    Yes.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Bad news.

<b>        THIEF
</b>    What?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    We've got a security camera in this
    bit of the shop.

<b>        THIEF
</b>    So?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    So, I saw you put that book down your
    trousers.

<b>        THIEF
</b>    What book?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    The one down your trousers.

<b>        THIEF
</b>    I haven't got a book down my trousers.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Right -- well, then we have something
    of an impasse.  I tell you what --
    I'll call the police -- and,  what can
    I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole
    book-down-the-trousers scenario, I
    really apologize.

<b>        THIEF
</b>    Okay -- what if I did have a book down
    my trousers?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Well, ideally, when I went back to
    the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan
    guide to Bali from your trousers, and
    either wipe it and put it back, or
    buy it.  See you in a sec.

  He returns to his desk.  In the monitor we just glimpse, as does
  William, the book coming out of the trousers and put back on the
  shelves.  The thief drifts out towards the door.  Anna, who has
  observed all this, is looking at a blue book on the counter.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Sorry about that...

<b>        ANNA
</b>    No, that's fine.  I was going to
    steal one myself but now I've changed
    my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you
    can find an unsigned copy, it's
    worth an absolute fortune.

  She smiles.  Suddenly the thief is there.

<b>        THIEF
</b>    Excuse me.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Yes.

<b>        THIEF
</b>    Can I have your autograph?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    What's your name?

<b>        THIEF
</b>    Rufus.

  She signs his scruffy piece of paper.  He tries to read it.

<b>        THIEF
</b>    What does it say?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Well, that's the signature -- and
    above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you
    belong in jail.'

<b>        THIEF
</b>    Nice one.  Would you like my phone
    number?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Tempting but... no, thank you.

  Thief leaves.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I think I will try this one.

  She hands William a £20 note and the book he said was rubbish.
  He talks as he handles the transaction.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Oh -- right -- on second thoughts
    maybe it wasn't that bad.  Actually
    -- it's a sort of masterpiece really.
    None of those childish kebab
    stories you get in so many travel
    books these days.  And I'll throw in
    one of these for free.

  He drops in one of the signed books.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Very useful for lighting fires,
    wrapping fish, that sort of things.

  She looks at him with a slight smile.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Thanks.

  And leaves.  She's out of his life forever.  William is a little
  dazed.  Seconds later Martin comes back in.

<b>        MARTIN
</b>    Cappuccino as ordered.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe
    who was just in here.

<b>        MARTIN
</b>    Who?  Someone famous?

  But William's innate natural English discretion takes over.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    No. No-one -- no-one.

  They set about drinking their coffees.

<b>        MARTIN
</b>    Would be exciting if someone famous
    did come into the shop though,
    wouldn't it?  Do you know -- this is
    pretty incredible actually -- I once
    saw Ringo Starr.  Or at least I think
    it was Ringo.  It might have been
    that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,'
    Toppy.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Topol.

<b>        MARTIN
</b>    That's right -- Topol.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    But Ringo Starr doesn't look
    anything like Topol.

<b>        MARTIN
</b>    No, well... he was quite a long way
    away.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    So it could have been neither of them?

<b>        MARTIN
</b>    I suppose so.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes,
    is it?

<b>        MARTIN
</b>    Not classic, no.

  Martin shakes his head.  William drains his cappuccino.


<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Right -- want another one?

<b>        MARTIN
</b>    Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy --
    I'll have an orange juice.

<b>  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY
</b>
  William sets off.

<b>  INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
</b>
  William collects his juice in a coffee shop on Westbourne Park
  Road.

<b>  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY
</b>
  William swings out of the little shop -- he turns the corner of
  Portobello Road and bumps straight into Anna.  The orange
  juice,  in its foam cup, flies.  It soaks Anna.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Oh Jesus.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Here, let me help.

  He grabs some paper napkins and starts to clean it off -- getting
  far too near her breasts in the panic of it...

<b>        ANNA
</b>    What are you doing?!

  He jumps back.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just
    over the street -- you could get
    cleaned up.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    No thank you.  I need to get my car
    back.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    I also have a phone.  I'm confident
    that in five minutes we can have you
    spick and span and back on the street
    again... in the non-prostitute sense
    obviously.

  In his diffident way, he is confident, despite her being
  genuinely annoyed.  She turns and looks at him.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Okay.  So what does 'just over the
    street' mean -- give it to me in yards.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Eighteen yards.  That's my house
    there.

  He doesn't lie -- it is eighteen yards away.  She looks down.
  She looks up at him.

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
  They enter.  She carries a few stylish bags.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Come on in.  I'll just...

  William runs in further -- it's a mess.  He kicks some old shoes
  under the stairs, bins an unfinished pizza and hides a plate of
  breakfast in a cupboard.  She enters the kitchen.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    It's not that tidy, I fear.

  And he guides her up the stairs, after taking the bag of books
  from her...

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    The bathroom is right at the top of
    the stairs and there's a phone on the
    desk up there.

  She heads upstairs.

<b>  INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
  William is tidying up frantically.  Then he hears Anna's feet on
  the stairs.  She walks down, wearing a short, sparkling black
  top beneath her leather jacket.  With her trainers still on.  He
  is dazzled by the sight of her.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Would you like a cup of tea before
    you go?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    No thanks.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Coffee?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    No.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Orange juice -- probably not.

  He moves to his very empty fridge -- and offers its only contents.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Something else cold -- coke, water,
    some disgusting sugary drink
    pretending to have something to do
    with fruits of the forest?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Really, no.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Would you like something to nibble --
    apricots, soaked in honey -- quite
    why, no one knows -- because it stops
    them tasting of apricots, and makes
    them taste like honey, and if you
    wanted honey, you'd just buy honey,
    instead of apricots, but nevertheless
    -- there we go -- yours if you want
    them.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    No.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Do you always say 'no' to everything?

  Pause.  She looks at him deep.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    No.
      (pause)
    I better be going.  Thanks for your
    help.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    You're welcome and, may I also say...
    heavenly.

  It has taken a lot to get this out loud.  He is not a smooth-
  talking man.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Take my one chance to say it.  After
    you've read that terrible book,
    you're certainly not going to be
    coming back to the shop.

  She smiles.  She's cool.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Thank you.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.

  He guides her towards the door.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Nice to meet you.  Surreal but nice.

  In a slightly awkward moment, he shows her out the door.  He
  closes the door and shakes his head in wonder.  Then...

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    'Surreal but nice.'  What was I
    thinking?

  ... He  shakes his head again in horror and wanders back along
  the corridor in silence.  There's a knock on the door.  He moves
  back, casually...

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Coming.

  He opens the door.  It's her.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Oh hi.  Forget something?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I forgot my bag.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Oh right.

  He shoots into the kitchen and picks up the forgotten shopping
  bag.  Then returns and hands it to her.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Here we go.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Thanks.  Well...

  They stand in that corridor -- in that small space.  Second time
  saying goodbye.  A strange feeling of intimacy.  She leans
  forward and she kisses him.  Total silence.  A real sense of the
  strangeness of those lips, those famous lips on his.  They part.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    I apologize for the 'surreal but nice'
    comment.  Disaster...

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Don't worry about it.  I thought the
    apricot and honey business was the
    real lowpoint.

  Suddenly there is a clicking of a key in the lock.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Oh my God.  My flatmate.  I'm sorry --
    there's no excuse for him.

  Spike walks in.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Hi.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Hi.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Hi.

  Spike walks past unsuspiciously and heads into the kitchen.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    I'm just going to go into the kitchen
    to get some food -- and then I'm going
    to tell you a story that will make your
    balls shrink to the size of raisins.

  And leaves them in the corridor.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Probably best not tell anyone about
    this.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell
    myself sometimes but... don't worry
    -- I won't believe it.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Bye.

  And she leaves, with just a touch of William's hand.  Spike
  comes out of the kitchen, eating something white out of a
  styrofoam container with a spoon.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    There's something wrong with this
    yogurt.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Well, there you go.
      (takes another big spoonful)
    On for a video fest tonight?  I've
    got some absolute classic.

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
  The lights are off.  William and Spike on the couch, just the
  light from the TV playing on their faces.  Cut to the TV full
  screen.  There is Anna.  She is in a stylish Woody Allen type
  modern romantic comedy, 'Gramercy Park,' in black and white.

<b>  INT. MANHATTAN ART GALLERY - DAY
</b>
  Anna's character -- Woody Anna -- is walking around the gallery
  with her famous co-star, Michael.  They should be the perfect
  couple, but there is tension.  Anna is not happy.

<b>        MICHAEL
</b>    Smile.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    No.

<b>        MICHAEL
</b>    Smile.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I've got nothing to smile about.

<b>        MICHAEL
</b>    Okay in about 7 seconds, I'm going to
    ask you to marry me.

  And after a couple of seconds -- wow -- she smiles.

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Imagine -- somewhere in the world
    there's a man who's allowed to kiss
    her.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Yes, she is fairly fabulous.

<b>  INT. BOOKSHOP - DAY
</b>
  The next day.  William and Martin quietly co-existing.  An annoy-
  ing customer enters.  Mr. Smith.

<b>        MR. SMITH
</b>    Do you have any books by Dickens?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    No, we're a travel bookshop.  We only
    sell travel books.

<b>        MR. SMITH
</b>    Oh right.  How about that new John
    Grisham thriller?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    No, that's a novel too.

<b>        MR. SMITH
</b>    Oh right.  Have you got a copy of
    'Winnie the Pooh'?

  Pause.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Martin -- your customer.

<b>        MARTIN
</b>    Can I help you?

  William looks up.  At that moment the entire window is suddenly
  taken up by the huge side of a bus, obscuring the light -- and
  entirely covered with a portrait of Anna -- from her new film,
  'Helix.'

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - CONDOR/LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
  William heads upstairs and pauses.  Spike coming down, wearing
  full body scuba diving gear.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Hey.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Hi...

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
  The two of them fixing a cup of tea in the kitchen.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Just incidentally -- why are you
    wearing that?

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Ahm -- combination of factors really.
    No clean clothes...

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    There never will be, you know, unless
    you actually clean your clothes.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was
    like rooting around in your things,
    and found this, and I thought -- cool.
    Kind of spacey.

<b>  EXT. WILLIAM'S TERRACE - DAY
</b>
  The two of them on the rooftop terrace, passing the day.
  William is reading 'The bookseller.'  The terrace is small and
  the plants aren't great -- but it overlooks London in a rather
  wonderful way.  Spike still in scuba gear, goggles on.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    There's something wrong with the
    goggles though...

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    No, they were prescription, so I could
    see all the fishes properly.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Groovy.  You should do more of this
    stuff.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    So -- any messages?

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Yeh, I wrote a couple down.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Two?  That's it?

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    You want me to write down all your
    messages?

  William closes his eyes in exasperation.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Who were the ones you didn't write
    down from?

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone
    completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was --
    one from your mum: she said don't
    forget lunch and her leg's hurting
    again.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Right.  No one else?

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Absolutely not.

  Spike leans back and relaxes.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Though if we're going for this
    obsessive writing-down-all-messages
    thing -- some American girl called
    Anna called a few days ago.

  William freezes -- then looks at Spike.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    What did she say?

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Well, it was genuinely bizarre...
    she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then
    she said, call me at the Ritz -- and
    then gave herself a completely
    different name.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Which was?

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one
    name's bad enough...

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
  William on the phone.  We hear the formal man at the other end of
  the phone.  And then intercut with him.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Hello.

<b>        RITZ MAN (V.O.)
</b>    May I help you, sir?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Ahm, look this is a very odd
    situation.  I'm a friend of Anna
    Scott's -- and she rang me at home the
    day before yesterday -- and left a
    message saying she's staying with
    you...

<b>  INT. RITZ RECEPTION - DAY
</b>
<b>        RITZ MAN
</b>    I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of
    that name here, sir.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    No, that's right -- I know that.  She
    said she's using another name -- but
    the problem is she left the message
    with my flatmate, which was a serious
    mistake.

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM
</b>
        WILLIAM (cont'd)
    Imagine if you will the stupidest
    person you've ever met -- are you
    doing that...?

  Spike happens to be in the foreground of this shot.  He's read-
  ing a newspaper.

<b>        RITZ MAN
</b>    Yes, sir.  I have him in my mind.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    And then double it -- and that is the
    -- what can I say -- git I'm living
    with and he cannot remember...

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Try 'Flintstone.'

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>      (to Spike)
    What?

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    I think she said her name was
    'Flintstone.'

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to
    you?

<b>        RITZ MAN
</b>    I'll put you right through, sir.

  Flintstone is indeed the magic word.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Oh my God.

  He practices how to sound.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Hello.  Hi.  Hi.

<b>        ANNA (V.O.)
</b>    Hi.

  We hear her voice -- don't see her.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>      (caught out)
    Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We,
    ahm I work in a bookshop.

<b>        ANNA (V.O.)
</b>    You played it pretty cool here,
    waiting for three days to call.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    No, I've never played anything cool
    in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll
    stab to death later, never gave me the
    message.

<b>        ANNA (V.O.)
</b>    Oh -- Okay.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Perhaps I could drop round for tea or
    something?

<b>        ANNA (V.O.)
</b>    Yeh -- unfortunately, things are
    going to be pretty busy, but... okay,
    let's give it a try.  Four o'clock
    could be good.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Right.  Great.
      (he hangs up)
    Classic.  Classic.

<b>  EXT. RITZ - DAY
</b>
  William jumps off a bus and walks toward the Ritz.  He carries a
  small bunch of roses.

<b>  INT. RITZ HOTEL - DAY
</b>
  He approaches the lifts.  At the lift, he pushes the button and
  the doors open.  As he is getting in, William is joined by a young
  man.  His name is Tarquin.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Which floor?

<b>        TARQUIN
</b>    Three.

  William pushes the button.  They wait for the doors to close.

<b>  INT. RITZ CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
  The lift lands.  William gets out.  So does Tarquin.  Rooms
  30-35 are to the left.  35-39 to the right.  William heads right.
  So does Tarquin.

  William is puzzled.  He slows down as he approaches room 38.  So
  does Tarquin.  William spots, so does Tarquin.  William points
  at the number.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Are you sure you...?

<b>        TARQUIN
</b>    Yes.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Oh.  Right.

  He knocks.  A bright, well-tailored American girl opens the door.

<b>        KAREN
</b>    Hello, I'm Karen.  Sorry -- things
    are running a bit late.  Here's the
    thing...

  She hands them a very slick, expensively produced press kits,
  with the poster picture of Anna, for the film 'Helix.'

<b>  INT. THE TRAFALGAR SUITE ANTE-ROOM - DAY
</b>
  A few seconds later -- they enter the main waiting room.  There
  are a number of journalists waiting for their audience.

<b>        KAREN
</b>    What did you think of the film?

<b>        TARQUIN
</b>    Marvellous.  'Close Encounters'
    meets 'Jean De Florette.'  Oscar-
    winning stuff.

  They both turn to William for his opinion.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    I agree.

<b>        KAREN
</b>    I'm sorry.  I didn't get down what
    magazines you're from.

<b>        TARQUIN
</b>    'Time Out.'

<b>        KAREN
</b>    Great.  And you...

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>      (seeing it on a coffee
       table)
    'Horse and Hound.'  The name's
    William Whacker.  I think she might
    be expecting me.

<b>        KAREN
</b>    Okay -- take a seat.  I'll check.

  They sit down as Karen goes off.

<b>        TARQUIN
</b>    You've brought her flowers?

  William goes for the cover-up.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    No -- they're... for my grandmother.
    She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought
    I'd kill two birds with one stone.

<b>        TARQUIN
</b>    I'm sorry.  Which hospital?

  Pause.  He's in trouble.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Do you mind me not saying -- it's a
    rather distressing disease and the
    name of the hospital rather gives it
    away.

<b>        TARQUIN
</b>    Oh sure.  Of course.

<b>        KAREN
</b>    Mr. Thacker.

  Saved by the bell.

<b>  INT. TRAFALGAR SUIT CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
<b>        KAREN
</b>    You've got five minutes.

  He is shown in through big golden doors.  Karen stays outside.

<b>  INT. THE TRAFALGAR SUITE SITTING ROOM - DAY
</b>
  There Anna is, framed in the window.  Glorious.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Hi.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Hello.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    I brought these, but clearly...

  There are lots of other flowers in the room.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Oh no, ho -- these are great.

  A fair amount of tension.  These two people hardly know each
  other -- and the first and last time they met, they kissed.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Sorry about not ringing back.  The
    whole two-names concept was totally too
    much for my flatman's pea-sized
    intellect.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I
    always choose a cartoon character --
    last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.

  At which moment Jeremy, Karen's boss, comes in.  A fairly grave,
  authoritative fifty-year-old PR man consulting a list.

<b>        JEREMY
</b>    Everything okay?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Yes, thanks.

<b>        JEREMY
</b>    And you are from 'Horse and Hound'
    magazine?

  William nods.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Is that so?

  William shrugs his shoulders.  Jeremy settles at a little desk
  in the corner and makes notes.  A pause.  William feels he has to
  act the part.  They sit in chairs opposite each other.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    So I'll just fire away, shall I?

  Anna nods.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Right.  Ahm... the film's great...
    and I just wondered -- whether you
    ever thought of having more...
    horses in it?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to
    -- but it was difficult, obviously,
    being set in space.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Obviously.  Very difficult.

  Jeremy leaves.

  William puts his head in his hands.  He was panic.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they
    thrust this thing into my hand -- I
    didn't know what to do.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    No, it's my fault, I thought this
    would all be over by now.  I just
    wanted to sort of apologize for the
    kissing thing.  I seriously don't
    know what got in to me.  I just wanted
    to make sure you were fine about it.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Absolutely fine about it.

  Re-enter Jeremy.

<b>        JEREMY
</b>    Do remember that Miss Scott is also
    keen to talk about her next project,
    which is shooting later in the summer.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Oh yes -- excellent.  Ahm -- any horses
    in that one?  Or hounds, of course.  Our
    readers are equally intrigued by both
    species.
<b>        ANNA
</b>    It takes place on a submarine.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Yes.  Right... But if there were horses,
    would you be riding them yourself or
    would you be getting a stunt horse person
    double sort of thing?

  Jeremy exits.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry.
    This is the sort of thing that happens
    in dreams -- not in real life.  Good
    dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to
    see you.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    And what happens next in the dream?

  It's a challenge.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Well, I suppose in the dream dream
    scenario.  I just... ahm, change my
    personality, because you can do that
    in dreams, and  walk across and kiss the
    girl but you know it'll never happen.

  Pause.  Then they move towards each other when... Jeremy
  enters.

<b>        JEREMY
</b>    Time's up, I'm afraid.  Sorry it was
    so short.  Did you get what you wanted?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Very nearly.

<b>        JEREMY
</b>    Maybe time for one last question?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Right.

  Jeremy goes out -- it's their last seconds.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Are you busy tonight?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Yes.

  They look at each other.  Jeremy enters, with another journalists
  in tow.  Anna and William stand and shake hands formally.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Well, it was nice to meet you.
    Surreal but nice.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's'
    favorite actress.  You and Black
    Beauty.  Tied.

<b>  INT. TRAFALGAR SUITE CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
  William exits fairly despondent and heads for the door.  Tarquin
  is in the corridor calling on his mobile phone.

<b>        TARQUIN
</b>    How was she?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Fabulous.

<b>        TARQUIN
</b>    Wait a minute -- she took your
    grandmother's flowers?

  William can't think his way out of this.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Yes.  That's right.  Bitch.

  He turns to go, but is accosted by Karen.

<b>        KAREN
</b>    If you'd like to come with me we can
    rush you through the others.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    The others?

<b>  INT. RITZ INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY
</b>
<b>        KAREN
</b>    Mr. Thacker's from 'Horse and Hound.'

  A forty-year-old actor with great presence warmly shakes
  William's hand.

<b>        MALE LEAD
</b>    Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the
    film?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Ah... yes, enormously.

<b>        MALE LEAD
</b>    Well, fire away.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy
    making the film?

<b>        MALE LEAD
</b>    I did.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Any bit in particular?

<b>        MALE LEAD
</b>    Well, you tell me which bit you liked
    most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed
    making it.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in
    space very much.  Did you enjoy
    making  that bit?

<b>  INT. RITZ INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY
</b>
  Same room same seat, minutes later, with a monolingual foreign
  actor and an interpreter.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Did you identify with the character
    you were playing?

<b>        INTERPRETER
</b>    Te identicaste con el personaje que
    interpretabas?

<b>        FOREIGN ACTOR
</b>    No.

<b>        INTERPRETER
</b>    No.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Ah.  Why not?

<b>        INTERPRETER
</b>    Por que no?

<b>        FOREIGN ACTOR
</b>    Porque es un robot carnivoro
    psicopata.

<b>        INTERPRETER
</b>    Because he is playing a psychopathic
    flesh-eating robot.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Classic.

<b>  INT. RITZ INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY
</b>
  And now William is sitting opposite an eleven-year-old American
  girl.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Is this your first film?

<b>        GIRL
</b>    No -- it's my 22nd.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Of course it is.  Any favourite among
    the 22?

<b>        GIRL
</b>    Working with Leonardo.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Da Vinci?

<b>        GIRL
</b>    Di Caprio.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Of course.  And is he your favourite
    Italian film director?

<b>  INT. RITZ CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
  William emerges traumatized into the corridor.  It is full of
  camera crews.  And there is Karen.

<b>        KAREN
</b>    Mr. Thacker?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>      (so weary)
    Yes?

<b>        KAREN
</b>    Have you got a moment?

<b>  INT. ANNA'S SUITE SITTING ROOM - DAY
</b>
  They knock on her door.

<b>        ANNA (V.O.)
</b>    Come in.

  William enters.  A certain nervousness.  They are alone again.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight
    -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told
    them I had to spend the evening with
    Britain's premier equestrian
    journalist.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no --
    shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's
    birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be
    having dinner.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Okay -- fine.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    No, I mean, if it's fine with you,
    I'll, you know, be your date.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    You'll be my date at my little sister's
    birthday party?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    If that's all right.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    I'm sure it's all right.  My friend
    Max is cooking and he's acknowledged
    to be the worst cook in the world, but
    you know, you could hide the food in
    your handbag or something.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Okay.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Okay.

<b>  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
  Bella and Max are in the kitchen.

<b>        MAX
</b>    He's bringing a girl?

<b>        BELLA
</b>    Miracles do happen.

<b>        MAX
</b>    Does the girl have a name?

<b>        BELLA
</b>    He wouldn't say.

<b>        MAX
</b>    Christ, what is going on in there?

  The oven seems to be smoking a little.  Then the bell rings.

        MAX (cont'd)
      Oh God.

  It's bad timing.  Max shoots out of the kitchen.

<b>  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
  Max heads for the door impatiently.  He opens it and turns back
  without looking at William and Anna standing there.

<b>        MAX
</b>    Come on in.  Vague food crisis.

  William and Anna move along the corridor to the kitchen.

<b>  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
  Bella is there.

<b>        BELLA
</b>    Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is
    proving more complicated than
    expected.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    He's cooking guinea fowl?

<b>        BELLA
</b>    Don't even ask.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Hi.

<b>        BELLA
</b>    Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting
    image of...

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Bella -- this is Anna.

<b>        BELLA
</b>    Right.
      (pause)

<b>        MAX
</b>    Okay.  Crisis over.

  He rises from his stove position.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Max.  This is Anna.

<b>        MAX
</b>    Hello, Anna ahm...
      (He recognizes her -- the
       word just falls out)
    Scott -- have some wine.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Thank you.

  Door bell goes.

<b>  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
  Max opens the door -- it is Honey.

<b>        MAX
</b>    Hi.

  She does a little pose, having worn a real party dress.

<b>        MAX
</b>    Yes, Happy Birthday.

  They head back along the corridor.

<b>        MAX
</b>    Look, your brother has brought this
    girl, and ahm...

<b>  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
  They enter the kitchen.

<b>        HONEY
</b>    Hi guys.
      (sees Anna)
    Oh holy fuck.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is
    Honey -- she's my baby sitter.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Hiya.

<b>        HONEY
</b>    Oh God this is one of those key moments
    in life, when it's possible you can be
    really, genuinely cool -- and I'm going
    to fail a hundred percent.  I absolutely
    and totally and utterly adore you and I
    think you're the most beautiful woman
    in the world and more importantly I
    genuinely believe and have believed for
    some time now that we can be best
    friends.  What do you think?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Ahm... I think that sounds -- you know
    -- lucky me.  Happy Birthday.

  She hands her a present.

<b>        HONEY
</b>    Oh my God.  You gave me a present.
    We're best friends already.  Marry
    Will -- he's a really nice guy and
    then we can be sisters.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I'll think about it.

  The front door bell goes.

<b>        MAX
</b>    That'll be Bernie.

  He heads out into the corridor to the front door.

<b>  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
  Max opens the door.

<b>        MAX
</b>    Hello, Bernie.

<b>        BERNIE
</b>    I'm sorry I'm so late.  Bollocksed up
    at work again, I fear.  Millions down
    the drain.

<b>  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
  They enter the room.

<b>        MAX
</b>    Bernie -- this is Anna.

<b>        BERNIE
</b>    Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.

  Doesn't recognize her -- turns to Honey.

<b>        BERNIE
</b>    Honey Bunny -- happy birthday to you.
      (hands her a present)
    It's a hat.  You don't have to wear
    it or anything.

<b>  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
  A minute or two later -- they are standing, drinking wine before
  dinner.  Bernie with Anna on their own -- William helping Max in
  the kitchen.

<b>        MAX
</b>    You haven't slept with her, have you?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    That is a cheap question and the answer
    is, of course, no comment.

<b>        MAX
</b>    'No comment' means 'yes.'

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    No, it doesn't.

<b>        MAX
</b>    Do you ever masturbate?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Definitely no comment.

<b>        MAX
</b>    You see -- it means 'yes.'

  Then on to Bernie's conversation.

<b>        BERNIE
</b>    So tell me Anna -- what do you do?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I'm an actress.

<b>        BERNIE
</b>    Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock-
    market, so not really similar fields,
    though I have done some amateur stuff
    -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce,
    all that.  'Ooh -- careful there,
    vicar.'  Always imagined it's a
    pretty tough job, though, acting.
    I mean the wages are a scandal,
    aren't they?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Well, they can be.

<b>        BERNIE
</b>    I see friends from university --
    clever chaps -- been in the business
    longer than you -- they're scraping
    by on seven, eight thousand a year.
    It's no life.  What sort of acting
    do you do?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Films mainly.

<b>        BERNIE
</b>    Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the
    pay in movies?  I mean, last film you
    did, what did you get paid?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Fifteen million dollars.

<b>        BERNIE
</b>    Right.  Right.  So that's... fairly
    good.  On the high side... have you
    tried the nuts?

<b>        MAX
</b>    Right -- I think we're ready.

  They all move towards the kitchen.

<b>        ANNA
</b>      (to Bella)
    I wonder if you could tell me where
    the...?

<b>        BELLA
</b>    Oh, it's just down the corridor on
    the right.

<b>        HONEY
</b>    I'll show you.

  A moment's silence as they leave -- then in a split second the
  others all turn to William.

<b>        BELLA
</b>    Quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly
    what are you doing here with Anna
    Scott?

<b>        BERNIE
</b>    Anna Scott?

<b>        BELLA
</b>    Yes.

<b>        BERNIE
</b>    The movie star?

<b>        BELLA
</b>    Yup.

<b>        BERNIE
</b>    Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.

  The horror of his remembered conversation slowly unfolds.
  Honey re-enters.

<b>        HONEY
</b>    I don't believe it.  I walked into the
    loo with her.  I was still talking when
    she started unbuttoning her jeans...
    She had to ask me to leave.

<b>  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CONSERVATORY - NIGHT
</b>
  A little later.  They are sat at dinner.  Bella next to Anna.

<b>        BELLA
</b>    What do you think of the guinea fowl?

<b>        ANNA
</b>      (whispering)
    I'm a vegetarian.

<b>        BELLA
</b>    Oh God.

<b>  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CONSERVATORY - NIGHT
</b>
  Moving on through the evening -- they are very relaxed, as they
  eat dinner.  A few seconds watching the evening going well -- Anna
  is taking this in -- real friends -- relaxed -- easy, teasing.
  And there's a cake.  Honey wears Bernie's unsuitable hat.  Anna
  watches William laughing at something and then putting his head
  in his hands with mock shame.

<b>  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CONSERVATORY - NIGHT
</b>
  Coffee time.

<b>        MAX
</b>    Having you here, Anna, firmly
    establishes what I've long suspected,
    that we really are the most desperate
    hot of under-achievers.

<b>        BERNIE
</b>    Shame!

<b>        MAX
</b>    I'm not saying it's a bad thing, in
    fact, I think it's something we should
    take pride in.  I'm going to give the
    last brownie as a prize to the saddest
    act here.

  A little pause.  Then William turns to Bernie.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Bernie.

<b>        BERNIE
</b>    Well, obviously it's me, isn't it --
    I work in the City in a job I don't
    understand and everyone keeps getting
    promoted above me.  I haven't had a
    girlfriends since... puberty and,
    well, the long and short of it is,
    nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks
    get any chubbier, they never will.

<b>        HONEY
</b>    Nonsense.  I fancy you.  Or I did
    before you got so far.

<b>        MAX
</b>    You see -- and unless I'm much mistaken,
    your job still pays you rather a lot of
    money, while Honey here, she earns
    nothing flogging her guts out at
    London's seediest record store.

<b>        HONEY
</b>    Yes.  And I don't have hair -- I've got
    feathers, and I've got funny goggly
    eyes, and I'm attracted to cruel men and
    ... no one'll ever marry me because my
    boosies have actually started
    shrinking.

<b>        MAX
</b>    You see -- incredibly sad.

<b>        BELLA
</b>    On the other hand, her best friend is
    Anna Scott.

<b>        HONEY
</b>    That's true, I can't deny it.  She
    needs me, what can I say?

<b>        BELLA
</b>    And most of her limbs work.  Whereas
    I'm stuck in its thing day and night,
    in a house full of ramps.  And to add
    insult to serious injury -- I've
    totally given up smoking, my favourite
    thing, and the truth is... we can't
    have a baby.

  Dead silence.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Bella.

  Bella shrugs her shoulders.  Bernie is totally grief-struck.

<b>        BERNIE
</b>    No.  Not true...

<b>        BELLA
</b>    C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots
    of ways, but... Surely it's worth a
    brownie.

  William reaches for her hand.  Max breaks the sombre mood.

<b>        MAX
</b>    Well, I don't know.  Look at
    William.  Very unsuccessful
    professionally.  Divorced.  Used to
    be handsome, now kind of squidgy
    around the edges -- and absolutely
    certain never to hear from Anna again
    after she's heard that his nickname
    at school was Floppy.

  They all laugh.  Anna smiles across at William.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    So I get the brownie?

<b>        MAX
</b>    I think you do, yes.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Wait a minute.  What about me?

<b>        MAX
</b>    I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the
    brownie?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Well... a shot at it.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    You'll have to prove it.  This is a
    great brownie and I'm going to fight
    for it.  State your claim.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Well, I've been on a diet since I was
    nineteen, which means basically I've
    been hungry for a decade.  I've had a
    sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one
    of whom hit me: and every time my heart
    gets broken it gets splashed across
    the newspapers as entertainment.
    Meantime, it cost millions to get me
    looking like this...

<b>        HONEY
</b>    Really?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Really -- and one day, not long from
    now...

  While she says this, quiet settles around the table.  The thing
  is -- she sort of means it and is opening up to them.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    ... my looks will go, they'll find out
    I can't act and I'll become a sad
    middle-aged woman who looks a bit like
    someone who was famous for a while.

  Silence... they all look at her... then.

<b>        MAX
</b>    Nah!!!  Nice try, gorgeous -- but you
    don't fool anyone.

  The mood is instantly broken.  They all laugh.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Pathetic effort to hog the brownie.

<b>  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM/CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
  Anna and William are leaving.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    That was such a great evening.

<b>        MAX
</b>    I'm delighted.

  He holds out his hand to shake.  She kisses him on the cheek.
  He stumbles back with joy.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.

<b>        MAX
</b>    Now you're lying.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    You're right.  I told you I was bad
    at acting.

  Max loves this.

<b>        ANNA
</b>      (to Bella)
    Lovely to meet you.

<b>        BELLA
</b>    And you.  I'll wait till you've gone
    before I tell him you're a
    vegetarian.

<b>        MAX
</b>    No!

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Night, night, Honey.

<b>        HONEY
</b>    I'm so sorry about the loo thing.
    I meant to leave but I just...
    look, ring me if you need someone to
    go shopping with.  I know lots of
    nice, cheap places... not that money
    necessarily...
      (gives up)
    nice to meet you.

  And Honey gives her a huge hug.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    You too -- from now on you are my
    style guru.

  Anna and William head out... Bernie tries to save some dignity.

<b>        BERNIE
</b>    Love your work.

  They move to the door and wave goodbye.

<b>  EXT. MAX AND BELLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
  William and Anna step outside.  From inside they hear a massive
  and hysterical scream of the friends letting out their true
  feelings.  William is a little embarrassed.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Sorry -- they always do that when I
    leave the house.

  The house is in Lansdowne Road, on the edge of Notting Hill.
  They walk for a moment.  A bit of silence.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Floppy, huh?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    It's the hair!  It's to do with the
    hair.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Why is she in a wheelchair?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    It was an accident -- about eighteen
    months ago.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    And the pregnancy thing -- is that to
    do with the accident?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    You know, I'm not sure.  I don't
    think they'd tried for kids before,
    as fate would have it.

  They walk in silence for a moment.  Then...

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Would you like to come... my house is
    just...?

  She smiles and shakes her head.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Too complicated.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    That's fine.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Busy tomorrow?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    I thought you were leaving.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I was.

<b>  EXT. NOTTING HILL GARDEN - NIGHT
</b>
  A little later in the walk.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    What's in there?

  They are now walking by a five foot railing, with foliage
  behind it.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Gardens.  All these streets round
    here have these mysterious communal
    gardens in the middle of them.
    They're like little villages.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Let's go in.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Ah no -- that's the point -- they're
    private villages -- only the people
    who live round the edges are allowed
    in.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    You abide by rules like that?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Ahm...

  Her look makes it clear that she is waiting with interest on
  the answer to this.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Heck no -- other people do -- but not
    me -- I just do what I want.

  He rattles the gate, then starts his climb -- but doesn't quite
  make it, and falls back onto the pavement...

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>      (casually)
    Whoopsidaisies.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    What did you say?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Nothing.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Yes, you did.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    No, I didn't.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    You said 'whoopsidaisies.'

  Tiny pause.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    I don't think so.  No one has said
    'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean
    unless they're...

<b>        ANNA
</b>    There's no 'unless.'  No one has said
    "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and
    even then it was only little girls
    with blonde ringlets.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Exactly.  Here we go again.

  He fails, and unfortunately, spontaneously...

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Whoopsidaisies.

  They look at each other.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    It's a disease I've got -- it's a
    clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and
    having injections -- it won't last
    long.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Step aside.

  She starts to climb.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Actually be careful Anna -- it's
    harder than it looks...

  But she's already almost over.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Oh no it's not -- it's easy.

  A few seconds later.  Anna jumps down into the garden.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Come on, Flops.

  William clambers over with terrible difficulty, dusts himself
  off, and heads towards where she stands.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Now seriously -- what in the world
    in this garden could make that
    ordeal worthwhile?

  She leans forward -- and, for the firs time since the first
  time -- she kisses him.  This time a proper kiss.  A tiny pause.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Nice garden.

<b>  EXT. MAGIC GARDEN - NIGHT
</b>
  They walk around the garden.  It's a moonlit dream.  We see
  the lights of the houses that surround the garden.  They come
  across a single, simple wooden bench.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    'For June, who loved this garden --
    from Joseph who always sat beside
    her.'

  We cut in and see an inscription carved into the wood.  She
  doesn't read the dates, carved below -- 'June Wetherby, 1917
  - 1992.'  She is slightly chocked by it.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Some people do spend their whole
    lives together.

  He nods.  They are standing on either side of the bench,
  looking at each other.  The camera glides away from them, up
  into the night sky, leaving them alone in the garden.  Music
  plays.

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING
</b>
  William in a towel rushes downstairs, having just had a shower.
  He shoots past Spike.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have
    you seen my glasses?

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    No, 'fraid not.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Bollocks.
      (still searching --
       with no help from
       Spike)
    This happens every time I go to the
    cinema.  Average day, my glasses are
    everywhere -- everywhere I look,
    glasses.  But the moment I need them
    they disappear.  It's one of life's
    real cruelties.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    That's compared to, like,
    earthquakes in the Far East or
    testicular cancer?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Oh shit, is that the time?  I have to
    go.

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM/CORRIDOR - EVENING
</b>
  He sprints downstairs, now fully dressed.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>      (not meaning it)
    Thanks for your help on the glasses
    thing.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>      (sincerely)
    You're welcome.  Did you find them?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Sort of.

<b>  INT. CINEMA - NIGHT
</b>
  Mid-film.  We move across the audience.  And there is in the
  middle of it, we see Anna, watching the screen, and next to
  her, William, watching the film keenly, through his scuba-
  diving goggles.

<b>  INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b>
  A very smart Japanese restaurant.  We see Anna and William
  sitting, near the end of their meal.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    So who left who?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    She left me.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Why?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    She saw through me.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Uh-oh.  That's not good.

  We've been aware of the conversation at a nearby table --
  now we can hear it.  Two slightly rowdy men.

<b>        LAWRENCE
</b>    No - No- No!  Give me Anna Scott any
    day.

  William and Anna look at each other.

<b>        GERALD
</b>    I didn't like that last film of hers.
    Fast asleep from the moment the
    lights went down.

  Again -- Anna reacts.

<b>        LAWRENCE
</b>    Don't really care what the films are
    like.  Any film with her in it --
    fine by me.

<b>        GERALD
</b>    No -- not my type at all really.  I
    prefer that other one -- blonde --
    sweet looking -- has an orgasm every
    time you take her out for a cup of
    coffee.

  Anna mouths 'Meg Ryan.'

<b>        LAWRENCE
</b>    Meg Ryan.

  William and Anna smile -- they're enjoying it.

<b>        GERALD
</b>    Drug-induced, I hear -- I believe
    she's actually in rehab as we speak.

<b>        LAWRENCE
</b>    Whatever, she's so clearly up for it.

  Anna's twinkle fades.

<b>        LAWRENCE
</b>    You know -- some girls, they're all
    'stay away chum' but Anna, she's
    absolutely gagging for it.  Do you
    know that in over fifty percent of
    languages the word for "actress" is
    the same as the word for "prostitute."

  This is horrible.

<b>        LAWRENCE
</b>    And Anna is your definitive actress
    -- someone really filthy you can just
    flip over...

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Right, that's it.

  He gets up and goes round the corner to the men.  There are in
  fact four of them, the two meeker men, Gavin and Harry, hanging
  on the other guys' witty words.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    I'm sorry to disturb you guys but --

<b>        LAWRENCE
</b>    Can I help you?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Well, yes, I wish I hadn't overheard
    your conversation -- but I did and I
    just think, you know...

  He's not a very convincing or frightening figure.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    ...the person you're talking about
    is a real person and I think she
    probably deserves a little bit more
    consideration, rather than having
    jerks like you drooling over her...

<b>        LAWRENCE
</b>    Oh sod off, mate.  What are you, her
    dad?

  Anna suddenly appears at his side and whips him away without
  being recognized.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    I'm sorry.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    No, that's fine.  I love that you
    tried... time was I'd have done the
    same.

  They walk on and then...

<b>        ANNA
</b>    In fact -- give me a second.

  And she walks straight back to their table.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Hi.

<b>        LAWRENCE
</b>    Oh my God...

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I'm sorry about my friend -- he's
    very sensitive.

<b>        LAWRENCE
</b>    No, look, I'm sorry...

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Please, please -- let's just leave
    it there.  I'm sure you meant no harm,
    and I'm sure it was just friendly
    banter and I'm sure you dicks are all
    the size of peanuts.  A perfect match
    for the size of your brains.  Enjoy
    your meal.  The tuna's really good.

  And she walks away.  Gerald turns to Lawrence.

<b>        GERALD
</b>    You prick.

<b>  EXT. RITZ ARCADE - NIGHT
</b>
  They are walking.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I shouldn't have done that.  I
    shouldn't have done that.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    No, you were brilliant

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I'm rash and I'm stupid and what
    am I doing with you?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    I don't know, I'm afraid.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I don't know either.

  They have arrived at the end of the arcade.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Here we are.
      (pause)
    Do you want to come up?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>      (he hoes)
    There seem to be lots of reasons
    why I shouldn't.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    There are lots of reasons.  Do you
    want to come up?

  His look says yes.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Give me five minutes.

  He watches her go -- and stands in the street.  Music plays.

<b>  INT. RITZ CORRIDOR/ANNA'S SUITE - NIGHT
</b>
  William coming along the hotel corridor.  He knocks on the
  door.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Hiya.

  There's something slightly awry.  He doesn't notice.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Hi.

  He kisses her gently on the cheek.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    To be able to do that is such a
    wonderful thing.

<b>        ANNA
</b>      (pause)
    You've got to go.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Why?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Because my boyfriend, who I thought
    was in America, is in fact in the
    next room.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Your boyfriend?

  He is duly shocked.  She's trying to be calm.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Yes...

<b>        JEFF (V.O.)
</b>    Who is it?

  Jeff drifts into view behind.  He is a very famous film star and
  looks the part -- well built, very handsome.  Unshaven, he has
  magic charm, whatever he says.  Over a t-shirt, he wears a
  shirt, which he unbuttons as he talks.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Ahm... room service.

<b>        JEFF
</b>    How you doing?  I thought you guys
    all wore those penguin coats.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just
    changed to go home -- but I thought
    I'd just deal with this final call.

<b>        JEFF
</b>    Oh great.  Could you do me a favour
    and try to get us some really cold
    water up here?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    I'll see what I can do.

<b>        JEFF
</b>    Still, not sparkling.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.

<b>        JEFF
</b>    Unless it's illegal in the UK to
    serve liquids below room temperature:
    I don't want you going to jail just
    to satisfy my whims...

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    No, I'm sure it'll be fine.

<b>        JEFF
</b>    And maybe you could just adios the
    dishes and empty the trash.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Right.

  And he does just that.  Scoops up the two used plates and heads
  to the bin.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure
    this is not his job.

<b>        JEFF
</b>    I'm sorry.  Is this a problem?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Ah -- no.  It's fine.

<b>        JEFF
</b>    What's your name?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Ahm... Bernie.

  Jeff slips him a fiver.

<b>        JEFF
</b>    Thank you, Bernie.
      (to Anna)
    Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty
    surprise?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Nice surprise.

  He kisses her.

<b>        JEFF
</b>    Liar.
      (to William)
    She hates surprises.  What are you
    ordering?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I haven't decided.

<b>        JEFF
</b>    Well, don't over-do it.  I don't want
    people saying, 'There goes that
    famous actor with the big, fat
    girlfriend."

  He wanders off taking off his t-shirt.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    I better leave.

  Anna just nods.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    -- this is a fairly strange reality
    to be faced with.  To be honest, I
    don't realize...

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I'm sorry... I don't know what to
    say.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    I think goodbye is traditional.

<b>  INT. RITZ CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
  William walks away.

<b>  EXT. RITZ - NIGHT
</b>
  William walks down the arcade outside the hotel.  He is
  stunned.

<b>  EXT. LONDON BUS - NIGHT
</b>
  William sits alone on a bus.  We see him through the side
  window.  As it drives away, we see that the whole back of the
  bus is taken up with a huge picture of Anna.

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
  He gets into his room and sits on the bed.

<b>  INT. SPACESHIP - NIGHT
</b>
  Space Anna, in the very hi-tech environment and a serious
  moods, fastens the last clasps on her uniform.  She takes a
  helmet type thing, and places it on her head.

<b>  INT. CONNECT CINEMA - NIGHT
</b>
  Cut round to the Coronet cinema where this film is showing.
  It's not full.  The camera moves and finds, sitting on his
  own...William.  Just watching.  We see a momentous flash of
  light from the screen explode, reflected in his eye.

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING
</b>
  William is looking out the window, lost in thought.  Spike
  enters.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Come on -- open up -- this is me --
    Spikey -- I'm in contact with some
    quite important spiritual vibrations.
    What's wrong?

  Spike settles on the arm of a chair.  William decides to open
  up a bit...

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Well, okay.  There's this girl...

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe.
    Good.  Speak on, dear friend.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    She's someone I just can't -- someone
    who... self-evidently can't be mine --
    and it's as if I've taken love-heroin
    -- and now I can't even have it again.
    I've opened Pandora's box.  And there's
    trouble inside.

  Spike nods thoughtfully.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Yeh.  Yeh... tricky... tricky... I
    knew a girl at school called Pandora
    ... never got to see her box though.

  He roars with laughter.  William smiles.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Thanks.  Yes -- very helpful.

<b>  INT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b>
  Only two tables are being used.  William and his friends are
  on their first course.  Bernie reads an "Evening Standard,"
  with a picture of Anna and Jeff at Heathrow Airport.

<b>        MAX
</b>    You didn't know she had a boyfriend?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    No -- did you?

  Their looks make it obvious that everyone did.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Bloody hell, I can't believe it --
    my whole life ruined because I don't
    read 'Hello' magazine.

<b>        MAX
</b>    Let's face facts.  This was always a
    no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess
    and you know what happens to mortals
    who get involved with the gods.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Buggered?

<b>        MAX
</b>    Every time.  But don't despair -- I
    think I have the solution to your
    problems.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Really?

  They all look to him for wise words.

<b>        MAX
</b>    Her name is Tessa and she works in
    the contracts department.  The hair,
    I admit, is unfashionable frizzy --
    but she's as bright as a button and
    kisses like a nymphomaniac on death
    row.  Apparently.

<b>  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
  The kitchen.  William is looking uneasy.  A doorbell rings.

<b>        MAX
</b>    Now -- try.

  William nods.  Max heads off to the door.  We stay with William
  -- and just hear the door open and a voice come down the
  corridor.

<b>        TESSA (V.O.)
</b>    I got completely lost -- it's real
    difficult, isn't it?  Everything's
    got the word 'Kensington' in it --
    Kensington Park Road, Kensington
    Gardens, Kensington bloody Park
    Gardens...

  They reach the kitchen.  Tessa is a lush girl with huge hair.

<b>        MAX
</b>    Tessa -- this is Bella my wife.

<b>        TESSA
</b>    Oh hello, you're in a wheelchair.

<b>        BELLA
</b>    That's right.

<b>        MAX
</b>    And this is William.

<b>        TESSA
</b>    Hello William.  Max has told me
    everything about you.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>      (frightened)
    Has he?

<b>        MAX
</b>    Wine?

<b>        TESSA
</b>    Oh yes please.  Come on, Willie, let's
    get sloshed.

  She turns to take the wine and William has a split second to send
  a message of panic to Bella.  She agrees -- it's bad.

<b>  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/CONSERVATORY - NIGHT
</b>
  Max walks over to the table.  Honey, Bella, William and another
  girl.

<b>        MAX
</b>    Keziah -- some woodcock?

<b>        KEZIAH
</b>    No, thank you  -- I'm a fruitarian.

<b>        MAX
</b>    I don't realize that.

  It is left to William, who has been set up here, to fill the
  pause.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    And ahm -- what's a fruitarian exactly?

<b>        KEZIAH
</b>    We believe that fruits and vegetables
    have feelings so we think cooking is
    cruel.  We only eat things that have
    actually fallen from the tree or bush
    -- that are, in fact, dead already.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Right.  Right.  Interesting stuff.
      (pause)
    So these carrots...

<b>        KEZIAH
</b>    Have been murdered, yes.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Murdered?  Poor carrots.  How beastly.

<b>  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CONSERVATORY - NIGHT
</b>
  Time for coffee and chocolates.  Beside William sits the final,
  perfect girl.  She is Rosie, quite young, smartly dressed,
  open-hearted.  It is just Max and William and Bella and her.

<b>        ROSIE
</b>    Delicious coffee.

<b>        MAX
</b>    Thank you.  I'm sorry about the lamb.

<b>        ROSIE
</b>    No -- I thought it was really, you know,
    interesting.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Interesting means inedible.

<b>        ROSIE
</b>    Really inedible -- yes that's right.

  They all laugh.  It's going very well.

<b>  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
  William is with Rosie by the door -- just about to say goodbye.

<b>        ROSIE
</b>    Maybe we'll meet again some time.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Yes.  That would be... great.

  She kisses him gently on the cheek.  He opens the door -- she
  walks out.  He shuts the door quietly and heads back into the
  living room...

<b>  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
  Max and Bella wait excitedly.

<b>        MAX
</b>    Well?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    She's perfect, perfect.

<b>        BELLA
</b>    And?

  William makes a gentle, exasperated gesture, then...

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    I think you have forgotten...
      (he looks at them)
    what an unusual situation you have
    here -- to find someone you actually
    love, who'll love you -- the chances
    are... always miniscule.  Look at me
    -- not counting the American -- I've
    only loved two girls in my whole life,
    both total disasters.

<b>        MAX
</b>    That's not fair.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    No really, one of them marries me and
    then leaves me quicker than you can
    say Indiana Jones -- and the other,
    who seriously ought to have known
    better, casually marries my best
    friend.

<b>        BELLA
</b>      (pause)
    Still loves you though.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    In a depressingly asexual way.

<b>        BELLA
</b>      (pause)
    I never fancied you much actually...

  They all roar with laughter.

<b>        BELLA
</b>    I mean I loved you -- you were terribly
    funny.  But all that kissing my ears...

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Oh no -- this is just getting worse.
    I am going to find myself, 30 years
    from now, still on this couch.

<b>        BELLA
</b>    Do you want to stay?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Why not -- all that awaits me at home
    is a masturbating Welshman.

  Music starts to play to take us through these silent scenes.

<b>  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
  Max lifts Bella off her couch and carries her upstairs.

  Mix through -- William sits on the couch downstairs -- eyes wide
  open -- thinking.

<b>  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
  Morning.  Max, all in his suit for the city... Bella kisses him
  goodbye.  William sees this from the kitchen.  She is also
  dressed for work -- and moves back into the kitchen to pack her
  briefcase with law books from the kitchen table.

<b>  EXT. MAX AND BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
  William emerges from the house, a little ruffled from a night
  away from home, a heads off.

<b>  EXT. NEWSAGENT - DAY
</b>
  William walks past the newsagent, heading for home.  We see,
  though he doesn't, a rack of tabloid papers, all of which seem
  to have very grainy, grabbed pictures of Anna on their front
  page.  Headlines --'Anna Stunna'-- 'It's Definitely Her!'
  and 'Scott of Pantartica.'

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
  William is shaving.  The bell goes.  He heads out to answer it.

<b>  EXT./INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE -DAY
</b>
  William arrives at the door and opens it.  There stands a dark-
  glassed Anna.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Hi.  Can I come in?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Come in.

  She moves inside.  Her hair is a mess -- her eyes are tired.
  Nothing idealized.

<b>  INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
  The two of them.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    They were taken years ago -- I know
    it was... well, I was poor and it
    happens a lot -- that's not an excuse
    -- but to make things worse, it now
    appears someone was filming me as
    well.  So what was a stupid photo-
    shoot now looks like a porno film.
    And well... the pictures have been
    solid and they're everywhere.

  William shakes his head.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I don't know where to go.  The hotel
    is surrounded.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    This is the place.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Thank you.  I'm just in London for two
    days -- but, with your papers, it's the
    worse place to be.

  She's very shaken.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    These are such horrible pictures.
    They're so grainy... they make me
    look like...

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Don't think about it.  We'll sort it
    out.  Now what would you like -- tea
    ... bath...?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    A bath would be great.

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
  Spike enters through the front door.  William doesn't hear him.
  Spike is reading newspapers with the Anna pictures in it.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Christ alive... brilliant... fantastic
    .... magnificent...

  He heads up the stairs.  Opens the bathroom door, walks in.

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
  Spike heads for the toilet -- undoes his zip...

<b>        ANNA
</b>    You must be Spike.

  She's in the bath.  Spike turns in shock -- and sidles out of the
  bathroom.

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
  Spike calms himself down.  He then opens the bathroom door
  again -- and looks in.

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
  Anna is still lying low in the bath.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Hi.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Just checking.

<b>  INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
  Spike comes back out into the corridor.  Looks to heaven.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Thank you, God.

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
  William and Anna at the kitchen table, eating toast, dringking
  tea.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I'm really sorry about last time.  He
    just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact,
    I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    No, that's fine.  It's not often one
    has the opportunity to adios the plates
    of a major Hollywood star.  It was a
    thrill for me.
      (she smiles.  Pause)
    How is he?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I don't know.  It got to the point where
    I couldn't remember any of the reasons
    I loved him.  And you... and love?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Well, there's a question -- without
    an interesting answer.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I have thought about you.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Oh no no -- no.

  He doesn't think she has to talk about this.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Just anytime I've tried to keep
    things normal with anyone normal --
    it's been a disaster.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    I appreciate that absolutely.
      (changing subject
       tactfully)
    Is that the film you're doing?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Would you like me to take you through
    your lines?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Hand it over.  Basic plot?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I'm a difficult but brilliant junior
    officer who in about twenty minutes
    will save the world from nuclear
    disaster.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Well done you.

<b>  EXT. TERRACE - DAY
</b>
  A little later.  They're in the thick of the script.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    'Message from command.  Would you like
    them to send in the HKs?'

<b>        ANNA
</b>    'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we
    need radar feedback before the KFT's
    return at 19 hundred -- then inform the
    Pentagon that we'll be needing black
    star cover from ten hundred through
    12.15' -- and don't you dare say one
    word about how many mistakes I made in
    that speech or I'll pelt you with
    olives.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that
    on straightaway.'

<b>        ANNA
</b>    'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I
    make?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Eleven.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Damn.  'And Wainwright...'

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Cartwright.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever
    your name is, I promised little Jimmy
    I'd be home for his birthday -- could
    you get a message through that I may
    be a little late.'

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'

<b>        ANNA
</b>    My son's name is Johnny?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Yup.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Well, get a message through to him
    too.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Brilliant.
      (the scene's over)
    Word perfect I'd say.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    What do you think?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's
    not Henry James, but it's gripping.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    You think I should do Henry James
    instead?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James.
    But, you know -- this writer's pretty
    damn good too.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone
    in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve
    to say 'inform the Pentagon that we
    need black star cover.'

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    And I think the book is the poorer for
    it.

  Anna smiles her biggest smile of the day.  He is helping.

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S DINING ROOM
</b>
  Anna and William.  Sat down at table.  There's a picture
  hanging on the wall behind.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I can't believe you have that picture
    on your wall.

  It is a poster of a Chagall painting of a floating wedding couple,
  with a goat as company.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    You like Chagall?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I do.  It feels like how being in love
    should be.  Floating through a dark
    blue sky.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    With a goat playing a violin.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness
    without a violin-playing goat.

  Spike enters with three pizzas.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Voila.  Carnival Calypso, for the
    Queen of Notting Hill -- pepperoni,
    pineapple and a little more
    pepperoni.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Fantastic.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    I don't mention that Anna's a
    vegetarian, did I?

<b>        SPIKE
</b>      (pause)
    I have some parsnip stew from last week.
    If I just peel the skin off, it'll be
    perfect.

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
  Later in the evening.  William and Anna on their own.  They're
  sipping coffee.  A few seconds of just co-existing.  Anna looks
  up.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    You've got big feet.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Yes.  Always have had.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    You know what they say about men with
    big feet?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    No.  What's that?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Big feet -- large shoes.

  He laughs.

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
  A few hours later -- eating ice-cream out of the tub.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    The thing that's so irritating is that
    now I'm so totally fierce when it comes
    to nudity clauses.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    You actually have clauses in your
    contact about nudity?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Definitely.  'You may show the dent at
    the top of the artist's buttocks -- but
    neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt
    person being used, the artist must have
    full consultation.'

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    You have a stunt bottom?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I could have a stunt bottom, yes.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Would you be tempted to go for a
    slightly better bottom than your own?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    It's one hell of a job.  What do you put
    on your passport?  Profession -- Mel
    Gibson's bottom.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Actually, Mel does his own ass work.
    Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Both.

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
  They are walking up the stairs -- and stop at the top.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Today has ben a good day.  Which under
    the circumstances is... unexpected.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Well, thank you.
      (awkward pause)
    Anyway -- time for bed.  Or...
    sofa-bed.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Right.

  Pause.  She leans forward, kisses him gently, then steps into
  the bedroom and closes the door.

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
  William downstairs -- on a sofa -- under a duvet.  Eyes open.
  Thinking.  Pause and pause.

  He waits and waits -- the ultimate 'yearn.'  But nothing
  happens.  William gets off the sofa decisively.  Sits on the
  side of it.  Then gets back in again.

  Pause, pause, then... in the darkness, a stair creaks.  There's
  someone there.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>      (to himself)
    Oh my God...
      (then...)
    Hello.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Hello.  I wonder if I could have a
    little word.

  He drifts round the corner, half-naked.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Spike.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    I don't want to interfere, or anything
    ... but she's split up from her boy-
    friend, that's right isn't it?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Maybe.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    And she's in your house.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Yes.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    And you get on very well.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Yes.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Well, isn't this perhaps a good
    opportunity to... slip her one?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in
    trouble -- get a grip.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Right.  Right.  You think it's the
    wrong moment.  Fair enough.
      (pause)
    Do you mind if I have a go?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Spike!

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    No -- you're right.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    I'll talk to you in the morning.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but
    okay.

  Back to William thinking again.  Dreamy atmosphere.  And then...
  more footsteps on the stairs.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Oh please sod off.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Okay.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    No! No.  Wait.  I... thought you were
    someone else.  I thought you were Spike.
    I'm delighted you're not.

  The darkness of the living room.  We see Anna in the shadow.

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
  A few moments later.  William and Anna stand in the middle of
  the room.  He kisses her neck.  Then her shoulder.  What a
  miracle it is just to be able to touch this girl's skin.  Then
  he looks at her face.  That face.  He is suddenly struck by who
  it is.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Wow.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    What?

  And then gets over it straight away.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Nothing.

  And kisses her.

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
  The middle of the night.  They are both asleep -- a yard apart.
  In sleep, her arm reaches out, touches his shoulder and then
  she wriggles across and re-settles herself, tenderly, right
  next to him.  He is not asleep and knows how extraordinary this
  all is.

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
  The morning.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    It still strikes me as, well, surreal,
    that I'm allowed to see you naked.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    You and every person in this country.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    What is it about men and nudity?
    Particularly breasts -- how can you be so
    interested in them?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Well...

<b>        ANNA
</b>    No seriously.  I mean, they're just
    breasts.  Every second person in the
    world has got them...

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    More than that actually, when you think
    about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very
    nice pair...

<b>        ANNA
</b>    But... they're odd-looking.  They're
    for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You
    must have seen a thousand of them --
    what's the fuss about?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>      (pause)
    Actually, I can't think really -- let
    me just have a quick look...

  He looks under the sheet at her breasts.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    No, beats me.

  She laughs...

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to
    bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.'
    Do you feel that?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Who was Gilda?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Her most famous part -- men went to bed
    with the dream -- and they didn't like
    it when they woke up with the reality --
    do you feel that way with me?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>      (pause)
    You're lovelier this morning than you
    have ever been.

<b>        ANNA
</b>      (very touched)
    Oh.

  She looks at him carefully.  Then leaps out of bed.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I'll be back.

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - MORNING
</b>
  William on the bed.  The door opens.  It is Anna with a tray of
  toast and tea.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Breakfast in bed.  Or lunch, or brunch.

  She heads across.  She smiles and sits on the bed.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Can I stay a bit longer?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Stay forever.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Damn, I forgot the jam.

  The doorbell goes.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    You get the door, I'll get the jam.

<b>  INT./EXT. WILLIAM'S CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
  William heads down the corridor and opens the door.  Outside
  are hundreds of paparazzi -- an explosion of cameras and
  questions, of noise and light.  The press seem to fill the
  entire street.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Jesus Christ.

  He comes back inside, snapping the door behind him.  Anna is in
  the kitchen.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    What?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Don't ask.

  She heads back the corridor, with no suspicion.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    You're up to something...

  She thinks he's fooling around.  She opens the door, the same
  explosion.  In a split second she's inside.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you
    dressed like that?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Undressed like this, yes.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Jesus.

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
  Anna is on the phone.  Spike is blithely heading downstairs to
  the kitchen in just his underpants.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Morning, daring ones.

  He does a thumbs up to William -- very excited about what he knows
  was a 'result.'

<b>        ANNA
</b>      (on the phone)
    It's Anna.  The press are here.  No,
    there are hundreds of them.  My
    brilliant plan was not so brilliant
    after all.  Yeh, I know, I know.  Just
    get me out then.
      (she hangs up)
    Damnit.

  She heads upstairs.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    I wouldn't go outside.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Why not?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Just take my work for it.

  The moment William goes upstairs, Spike heads for the front
  door.

<b>  EXT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
  From outside -- we see this scrawny bloke in the frame of the
  doorway, in his grey underpants.  A thousand photos.  Spike
  poses athletically.

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
  Spike closes the door and wanders along to a mirror in the hall-
  way, muttering.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    How did I look?

  Inspects himself.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Not bad.  No bad at all.  Well-chosen
    briefs, I'd say.  Chicks love grey.
    Mmmmm.  Nice firm buttocks.

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
  William enters.  He's unhappy for her.  She's almost dressed.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    How are you doing?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    How do you think I'm doing?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    I don't know what happened.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd
    make a buck or two telling the papers
    where I was.

  She's packing.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    That's not true.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Really?  The entire British press just
    woke up this morning and thought 'Hey --
    I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in
    that house with the blue door in Notting
    Hill.'  And then you go out in your
    goddamn underwear.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>      (dropping in)
    I went out in my goddamn underwear too.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Get out, Spike.
      (he does)
    I'm so sorry.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    This is such a mess.  I come to you to
    protect myself against more crappy
    gossip and now I'm landed in it all
    over again.  For God's sake, I've got
    a boyfriend.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    You do?

  It's a difficult moment -- defining where they stand.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    As far as they're concerned I do.  And
    now tomorrow there'll be pictures of
    you in every newspapers from here to
    Timbuktu.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    I know, I know -- but... just -- let's
    stay calm...

<b>        ANNA
</b>    You can stay calm -- it's the perfect
    situation for you -- minimum input,
    maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever
    bump into will know.  'Well done you --
    you slept with that actress -- we've
    seen the pictures.'

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    That's spectacularly unfair.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Who knows, it may even help business.
    Buy a boring book about Egypt from the
    guy who screwed Anna Scott.

  She heads out.

<b>  INT. STAIRS/LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down.
    Have a cup of tea.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I
    want to go home.

  The doorbell goes.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Spike, check who that is... and for
    God's sake put some clothes on.

  Spike leans merrily out of the window.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Looks like a chauffeur to me.

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN/CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
  They move from the kitchen into the corridor.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    And remember -- Spike owes you an
    expensive dinner.  Or holiday --
    depending if he's got the brains to get
    the going rate on betrayal.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    That's not true.  And wait a minute...
    this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just
    laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the
    huge sweep of things, this stuff
    doesn't matter.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    What he's going to say next is -- there
    are people starving in the Sudan.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Well, there are.  And we don't need to
    go anywhere near that far.  My best
    friend slipped -- she slipped down-
    stairs, cracked her back and she's in a
    wheelchair for the rest of her life.
    All I'm asking for is a normal amount
    of perspective.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    You're right: of course, you're right.
    It's just that I've dealt with this
    garbage for ten years now -- you've had
    it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives
    are different.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    I mean -- today's newspapers will be
    lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Excuse me?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Well, you know -- it's just one day.
    Today's papers will all have been
    thrown away tomorrow.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    You really don't get it.  This story
    gets filed.  Every time anyone writes
    anything about me -- they'll dig up
    these photos.  Newspapers last forever.
    I'll regret this forever.

  He takes this in.  That's the end.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Right.  Fine.  I will do the opposite,
    if it's all right by you -- and always be
    glad you came.  But you're right -- you
    probably better go.

  She looks at him.  The doorbell goes again.  She opens the door.
  Massive noise and photos.  Outside are her people, including
  Karen, a chauffeur, two bodyguards.  And then the door is shut
  and they're all gone.  Silence.

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN/CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
  Spike and William sitting there.  Pause.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Was it you?

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    I suppose I might have told one or two
    people down the pub.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Right.

  He puts his head in his hands.  It's over now.

<b>  EXT. LONDON - DAY
</b>
  As full, sad music plays -- William begins to walk through
  Notting Hill.

  This walk takes six months... as he walks, the seasons actually
  and magically change, from summer, through autumn and winter,
  back into spring...

  First it is summer -- summer fruits and flowers -- a six-month
  pregnant woman -- Honey with another leather-jacket boyfriend.

  As he walks on the rain starts to fall -- he turns up his coat
  collar -- umbrellas appear.  Followed by winter coats --
  chestnuts roasting -- Christmas trees on sale and the first hint
  of snow.

  Then he comes to Blenheim Crescent, which is startling snowscape,
  for the hundred yard, right across Ladbroke Grove.

  By the time he reaches the purple cafe, the snow is melting and
  in a few yards, it is spring again.  He passes Honey again --
  arguing with her boyfriend, walking away tearful.  Then turns
  past 'the pregnant woman' -- now holding her three-month baby.
  The camera holds on her.

<b>  INT. BOOKSHOP - DAY
</b>
  A grey day in the bookshop.  Martin and William.  As ever.  A
  feeling that things in there ever change.

  Ten seconds pass.  Honey rushes in.  Spike, still feeling in
  disgrace, comes in with her but lingers in the doorway.

<b>        HONEY
</b>    Have we got something for you.
    Something which will make you love me so
    much you'll want to hug me every single
    day for the rest of my life.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Blimey.  What's that?

<b>        HONEY
</b>    The phone number of Anna Scott's agent
    in London and her agent in New York.
    You can ring her.  You think about her
    all the time -- now you can ring her!

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Well, thanks, that's great.

<b>        HONEY
</b>    It is great, isn't it.  See you tonight.
    Hey, Marty-- sexy cardy.

  And she rushes out.  William looks at the piece of paper, folds
  it and then places it gently in the garbage bin.

<b>  INT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b>
  Bella bangs a spoon on a wine bottle.  All the friends are
  gathered in the restaurant.

<b>        BELLA
</b>    I have a little speech to make -- I won't
    stand up because I can't... be bothered.
    Exactly a year ago today, this man here
    started the finest restaurant in London.

<b>        TONY
</b>    Thank you very much.

<b>        BELLA
</b>    Unfortunately -- no one ever came to eat
    here.

<b>        TONY
</b>    A tiny hiccough.

<b>        BELLA
</b>    And so we must face the fact that from
    next week, we have to find somewhere
    near to eat.

  Tony's brave face breaks.  The dream is over.

<b>        BELLA
</b>    I just want to say to Tony -- don't take
    it personally.  The more I think about
    things, the more I see no rhyme or reason
    in life -- no one knows why some things
    work out, and some things don't -- why
    some of us get lucky -- and some of us...

<b>        BERNIE
</b>    ... get fired.

<b>        BELLA
</b>    No!

<b>        BERNIE
</b>    Yes, they're shifting the whole outfit
    much more towards the trading side --
    and of course...
      (he owns up)
    I was total crap.

  They're all rather stunned.

<b>        TONY
</b>    So we go down together!  A toast to
    Bernie -- the worst stockbroker in the
    whole world!

  They toast him.

<b>        HONEY
</b>    Since it's an evening of announcements
    ... I've also got one, Ahm... I've
    decided to get engaged.

  Total bewilderment from the others.

<b>        HONEY
</b>    I've found myself a nice, slightly odd
    looking bloke who I know is going to
    make me happy for the rest of my life.

  Special cut to Bernie -- the shot shows he had special feelings
  for Honey.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I
    don't know anything about this.

<b>        MAX
</b>    Is it someone we know?

<b>        HONEY
</b>    Yes.  I will keep you informed.

  As she sits down, Honey leans towards Spike and whispers.

<b>        HONEY
</b>    By the way -- it's you.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Me?

<b>        HONEY
</b>    Yes.  What do you think?

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Well, yes.  Groovy.

<b>        MAX
</b>    Any more announcements?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Yes -- I feel I must apologize to
    everyone for my behavior for the last
    six months.  I have, as you know, been
    slightly down in the mouth.

<b>        MAX
</b>    There's an understatement.  There are
    dead people on better form.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    But I wish to make it clear I've turned
    a corner and henceforward intend to be
    impressively happy.

<b>  INT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b>
  Two hours later.  They've had a very good time.  There's been a
  chocolate cake.  Lots of alcohol.  Tony is playing 'Blue Moon'
  on the piano, and Bernie joins him, singing.

  At one table Bella and Honey sit -- beer and wine on the table.

<b>        BELLA
</b>    I'm really horribly drunk.

  Elsewhere, Max an William are relaxed together.

<b>        MAX
</b>    So -- you've laid the ghost.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    I believe I have.

<b>        MAX
</b>    Don't give a damn about the famous girl.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    No, don't think I do.

<b>        MAX
</b>    Which means you won't be distracted by
    the fact that she's back in London,
    grasping her Oscar, and to be found
    filming most days on Hampstead Heath.

  He puts down a copy of the 'Evening Standard' with a picture of
  Anna on its cover.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>      (immediate gloom)
    Oh God no.

<b>        MAX
</b>    So not over her, in fact.

<b>  EXT. HAMPSTEAD HEATH - DAY
</b>
  Cut to the wide sweep of Hampstead Heath.  William entirely
  alone.  He marches up a hill... goes over the crest of it -- and
  sees a huge film crew and hundreds of extras in front of the
  radiant white of Kenwood House, with its lawn and its lakes.

<b>  EXT. KENWOOD HOUSE - DAY
</b>
  Now closer to the house, William approaches a barrier -- where
  he is himself approached.

<b>        SECURITY
</b>    Can I help you?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...

<b>        SECURITY
</b>    Does she know you're coming?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    No, no.  She doesn't.

<b>        SECURITY
</b>    I'm afraid I can't really let you
    through then, sir.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm
    not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...

<b>        SECURITY
</b>    ... can't let you through.

  At that moment -- thirty yards away, William sees trailer door
  open.  Out of it comes Anna -- looking extraordinary -- in a
  velvet dress; full, beautiful make-up; rich, extravagant hair.
  She has a necessary cluster of people about her.  Hair, make-up,
  costume and the third assistant who has collected her.

  She walks a few yards, and then casually turns her head.  And
  sees him.  Her face registers not jut surprise, certainly not a
  simple smile.  His being there is a complicated thing.
  Cut back to him.  He does a small wave.  She pauses as the whole
  paraphernalia of the upcoming scene passes between them.  The
  movie divides them.  But then she begins to walk through it, and
  followed by her cluster, she makes her way towards him.  When
  she reaches him, the security guard stands back a pace, and her
  people hold back.  She doesn't really know what to say...

<b>        ANNA
</b>    This is certainly... ah...

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    I only found out you were here
    yesterday.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I was going to ring... but... I didn't
    think you'd want to...

  The third assistant is under pressure.

<b>        THIRD
</b>    Anna.

  She looks around.  The poor third is nervous -- and the first is
  approaching.

<b>        ANNA
</b>      (to William)
    It's not going very well -- and it's
    our last day.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    But... wait... there are things to say.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Okay.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Drink tea -- there's lots of tea.

  She is swept away, four people touching her hair and costume.

<b>        KAREN
</b>    Come and have a look...

<b>  EXT. KENWOOD PARK - DAY
</b>
  As they make towards the set...

<b>        KAREN
</b>    Are you a fan of Henry James?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    This is Henry James film?

<b>  EXT. KENWOOD HOUSE - DAY
</b>
  A complicated shot is about to happen -- with waves of extras --
  and a huge moving crane.  They end up next to the sound desk.

<b>        KAREN
</b>    This is Harry -- he'll give you a pair of
    headphones so you can hear the dialogue.

  Harry the sound man is a pleasant, fifty-year-old balding
  fellow.  He hands him the headphones.

<b>        HARRY
</b>    Here we go.  The volume control is on
    the side.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    That's great.

  William, the headphones on, surveys the scene -- the cluster is
  a full 100 yards from the action, to allow a gracious sweeping
  wide-shot.  He watches Anna.  She is with her co-star in the
  Henry James film -- let's call him James.

<b>        JAMES
</b>    We are living in cloudcuckooland --
    we'll never get this done today.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    We have to.  I've got to be in New York
    on Thursday.

<b>        JAMES
</b>    Oh, stop showing off.

  He studies an actress a few yards to the left.

<b>        JAMES
</b>    God, that's an enormous arse.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I'm not listening.

<b>        JAMES
</b>    No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so
    many tragic young teenagers with
    anorexia -- and that girl has an arse
    she could perfectly well share round
    with at least ten other women -- and
    still be beg-bottomed.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I said I'm not listening -- and I think,
    looking at something that firm, you and
    your droopy little excuse for an 'arse'
    would be well-advised to keep quiet.

  Back by the desk, William is listening and laughs.  That's his
  girl.  Anna prepares.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    So I ask you when you're going to tell
    everyone, and you say...?

<b>        JAMES
</b>    'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'

<b>        ANNA
</b>    And then I... right.

<b>        JAMES
</b>    Who was that rather difficult chap you
    were talking to on the way up?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Oh... no one... no one.  Just some...
    guy from the past.  I don't know what
    he's doing here.  Bit of an awkward
    situation.

<b>  EXT. HAMPSTEAD HEATH - DAY
</b>
  Cut back to William -- he has heard.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Of course.

  He takes off the headphones and puts them gently down.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Thank you.

<b>        HARRY
</b>    Anytime.

  William walks away.  The moment of hope is gone.  He couldn't
  have had a clear reminder.

<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING
</b>
  William is emptying Anna Scott videos into a box.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    What's going on?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    I'm going to throw out these old videos.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    No.  You can't bin these.  They're
    classics.  I'm not allowing this.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Right -- let's talk about rent...

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Let me help.  We don't want all this
    shit cluttering up our lives.

<b>  INT. BACKROOM OF THE BOOKSHOP - DAY
</b>
  The next day.  William is hard at work, doing the accounts in a
  dark small room with files in it.  Martin pops his head in.

<b>        MARTIN
</b>    I have to disturb you when you're
    cooking the books, but there's a
    delivery.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Martin, can't you just deal with this
    yourself?

<b>        MARTIN
</b>    But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet
    rag as much as I pay you?

  They head out, Martin behind him, incomprehensively rubbing
  his hands -- he's in a very good mood.

<b>  INT. BOOKSHOP - DAY
</b>
  William enters -- and there stands Anna -- in a simple blue
  skirt and top.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Hi.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Hello.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    You disappeared.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I
    didn't want to disturb you.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Well... how have you been?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Fine.  Everything much the same.  When
    they change the law Spike and I will
    marry immediately.  Whereas you...
    I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory
<b>    ...
</b>
<b>        ANNA
</b>    Oh no.  It's all nonsense, believe me.
    I had no idea how much nonsense it all
    was -- but nonsense it all is...
      (she's nervous)
    Well, yesterday was our last day
    filming and so I'm just off -- but I
    brought you this from home, and...

  It's quite a big wrapped parcel, flat -- 3 foot by 4 foot,
  leaning against a bookshelf.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I thought I'd give it to you.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Thank you.  Shall I...

<b>        ANNA
</b>    No, don't open it yet -- I'll be
    embarrassed.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know
    what it's for.  But thank you anyway.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I actually had it in my apartment in New
    York and just thought you'd... but,
    when it came to it, I didn't know how to
    call you... having behaved so... badly,
    twice.  So it's been just sitting in the
    hotel.  But then... you came, so I
    figured... the thing is... the thing is
<b>    ...
</b>
<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    What's the thing?

  Then the door pings.  In walks the annoying customer, Mr. Smith.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Don't even think about it.  Go away
    immediately.

  Mr. Smith is taken aback and therefore completely obedient.

<b>        MR. SMITH
</b>    Right.  Sorry.

  And he leaves.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    You were saying...

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away
    today but I wondered, if I didn't,
    whether you might let me see you a bit...
    or, a lot maybe... see if you could...
    like me again.

  Pause as William takes this in.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    But yesterday... that actor asked you
    who I was... and you just dismissed me
    out of hand... I heard -- you had a
    microphone... I had headphones.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    You expect me to tell the truth about my
    life to the most indiscreet man in
    England?

  Martin edges up.

<b>        MARTIN
</b>    Excuse me -- it's your mother on the
    phone.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Can you tell her I'll ring her back.

<b>        MARTIN
</b>    I actually tried that tack -- but she
    said you said that before and it's been
    twenty-four hours, and her foot that
    was purple is now a sort of blackish
    color...

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold
    the fort for a second will you, Martin?

  Martin is left with Anna.

<b>        MARTIN
</b>    Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a
    wonderful film.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Is that right?

<b>        MARTIN
</b>    Yes... I've always wondered what
    Patrick Swayze is like in real life.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I can't say I know Patrick all that
    well.

<b>        MARTIN
</b>    Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the
    filming?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly --
    to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in
    'Ghost.'

  She's kind in here, not sarcastic.

<b>        MARTIN
</b>    Oh right.  Right.  Sorry.  Always been
    a bit of an ass.

  William returns a little uneasy.

<b>        MARTIN
</b>    Anyway... it's lovely to meet you.  I'm
    a great fan of yours.  And Demi's, of
    course.

  Martin leaves them.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Sorry about that.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    That's fine.  There's always a pause
    when the jury goes out to consider its
    verdict.

  She's awaiting an answer.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Anna.  Look -- I'm a fairly level-
    headed bloke.  Not often in and out of
    love.  But...

  He can't really express what he feels.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    ... can I just say 'no' to your kind
    request and leave it at that?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    ... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I...
    you know... of course... I'll just...
    be getting along then... nice to see
    you.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    The truth is...

  He feels he must explain.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    ... with you, I'm in real danger.  It
    took like a perfect situation, apart
    from that foul temper of yours -- but my
    relatively inexperienced heart would,
    I fear, not recover if I was once again
    ... cast aside, which I would
    absolutely expect to be.  There are too
    many pictures of you everywhere, too
    many films.  You'd go and I'd be...
    well, buggered, basically.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I see.
      (pause)
    That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    I live in Notting Hill.  You live in
    Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world
    knows who you are.  My mother has
    trouble remembering my name.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.

  Pause.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    The fame thing isn't really real, you
    know.  Don't forget -- I'm also just a
    girl.  Standing in front of a boy.
    Asking him to love her.

  Pause.  She kisses him on the cheek.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Bye.

  Then turns and leaves.  Leaving him.

<b>  INT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - DAY
</b>
  The restaurant is in the middle of being deconstructed.  The
  pictures are gone off the walls -- a kettle on a long extension
  lead is on the bare table behind.  They're all sitting there.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    What do you think?  Good move?

<b>        HONEY
</b>    Good move: when all is said and done,
    she's nothing special.  I saw her
    taking her pants off and I definitely
    glimpsed some cellulite down there.

<b>        BELLA
</b>    Good decision.  All actresses are mad
    as snakes.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Tony -- what do you think?

<b>        TONY
</b>    Never met her, never want to.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Brilliant.  Max?

<b>        MAX
</b>    Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.

  Spike enters.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    I was called and I came.  What's up?

<b>        HONEY
</b>    William has just turned down Anna Scott.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    You daft prick!

  Bella is casually looking at the painting that sits beside
  William.  It is the original of the Chagall, the poster of which
  was on his wall.

<b>        BELLA
</b>    This painting isn't the original, is
    it?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Yes, I think that one may be.

<b>        BERNIE
</b>    But she said she wanted to go out with
    you?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Yes -- sort of...

<b>        BERNIE
</b>    That's nice.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    What?

<b>        BERNIE
</b>    Well, you know, anybody saying they
    want to go out with you is... pretty
    great... isn't it...

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean,
    I know she's an actress and all that, so
    she can deliver a line -- but she said
    that she might be as famous as can be --
    but also... that she was just a girl,
    standing in front of a boy, asking him
    to love her.

  They take in the line.  It totally reverses their attitudes.
  A pause.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Oh sod a dog.  I've made the wrong
    decision, haven't I?

  They look at him.  Spike does a big nod.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Max, how fast is your car?

<b>  EXT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - DAY
</b>
  Max's car arrives in the street outside.  They pile into the
  car.

<b>        MAX
</b>    If anyone gets in our way -- we have
    small nuclear devices.

<b>        BERNIE
</b>    And we intend to use them!

<b>        MAX
</b>    Where's Bella?

<b>        HONEY
</b>    She's not coming.

<b>        MAX
</b>    Sod that.  Bernie -- in the back!

  He shoots out of his door, rushes round and grabs Bella out of
  the chair.

<b>        MAX
</b>    Come on, babe.

<b>  EXT./INT. CAR. STANLEY CRESCENT/NOTTING HILL GATE - DAY
</b>
  Max's car is shooting up Stanley Crescent.  We are inside and
  outside the car.

<b>        BELLA
</b>    Where are you going?

<b>        MAX
</b>    Down Kensington Church Street, then
    Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.

<b>        BELLA
</b>    Crazy.  Go along Bayswater...

<b>        HONEY
</b>    That's right -- then Park Lane.

<b>        BERNIE
</b>    Or you could go right down to Cromwell
    Road, and left.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    No!

  Suddenly the car slams to a halt.

<b>        MAX
</b>    Stop right there!  I will decide the
    route.  All right?

<b>        ALL
</b>    All right.

<b>        MAX
</b>    James Bond never has to put up with this
    sort of shit.

<b>  EXT. PICCADILLY - DAY
</b>
  The car turns illegally right across Piccadilly the wrong way
  down a one-way street and ends up outside the Ritz.  William
  sprints into the hotel.  Bernie follows.

<b>        BERNIE
</b>    Bloody hell, this is fun.

<b>  IT. RITZ LOBBY - DAY
</b>
<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Is Miss Scott staying here?

  It is the same man.

<b>        RITZ MAN
</b>    No, sir.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    How about Miss Flintstone?

<b>        RITZ MAN
</b>          No, sir.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or
    Butthead?

  Man shakes his head.

<b>        RITZ MAN
</b>    No, sir.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.

  He turns despondent and takes two steps when the Ritz Man stops
  him in his tracks.

<b>        RITZ MAN
</b>    There was a Miss Pocahontas in room 126
    -- but she checked out an hour ago.  I
    believe she's holding a press
    conference at The Savoy before flying to
    America.

  William is very grateful.  He kisses the Ritz Man.  Bernie's also
  gratuful.  He kisses him too.

<b>        BERNIE
</b>    We have lift off!!

  A Japanese guest assumes this is the way to behave and the Ritz
  Man gets kissed a third time.

<b>  EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY
</b>
  The car speeds through London.  It gets totally stuck at a
  junction where no one will let them in.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Bugger this for a bunch of bananas.

  He gets out of the car and boldly stops the traffic coming in the
  opposite direction.  Our car shoots past him.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    Go!

  They leave him behind.  Honey leans out the window and shouts...

<b>        HONEY
</b>    You're my hero.

  Spike waves wildly -- he loses concentration and is very nearly
  hit by a car.

<b>  EXT. THE SAVOY - DAY
</b>
  They pull to a stop.  William leaps out.

<b>        MAX
</b>    Go!

<b>  INT. THE SAVOY - DAY
</b>
  William rushes up to the main desk.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Excuse me, where's the press
    conference?

<b>        MAN AT SAVOY
</b>    Are you an accredited member of the
    press?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Yes...

  He flashes a card.

<b>        MAN AT SAVOY
</b>    That's a Blockbuster video membership
    card, sir.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    That's right... I work for their in-
    house magazine.
      (mimes quotation marks)
    'Movies are our business.'

<b>        MAN AT SAVOY
</b>    I'm sorry, sir...

  Honey shoots into shot, pushing Bella's chair.

<b>        BELLA
</b>    He's with me.

<b>        MAN AT SAVOY
</b>    And you are?

<b>        BELLA
</b>    Writing an article about how London
    hotels treat people in wheelchairs.

<b>        MAN AT SAVOY
</b>    Of course, madam.  It's in the
    Lancaster Room.  I'm afraid you're very
    late.

<b>        HONEY
</b>      (to William)
    Run!

<b>  INT. SAVOR ROOM - DAY
</b>
  William runs, searching.  At last finds the room, and enters.

<b>  INT. LANCASTER ROOM - DAY
</b>
  Huge room -- full of press.  Row after row of journalists,
  cameras at the front, TV cameras at the back.  Anna clearly
  gives press conferences very rarely, because this one is
  positively presidential.  She sits at a table at the end of the
  room, beside Karen: on her other side is Jeremy, the PR boss,
  firmly marshalling the questions.

<b>        JEREMY
</b>    Yes... You -- Dominic.

<b>        QUESTIONER 1
</b>    How much longer are you staying in the
    UK then?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    No time at all.  I fly out tonight.

  She's in a slightly melancholic and therefore honest mood.

<b>        JEREMY
</b>    Which is why we have to round it up now.
    Final questions.

  He points at a journalist he knows.

<b>        QUESTIONER  2
</b>    Is your decision to take a year off
    anything to do with the rumours about
    Jeff and his present leading lady?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Absolutely not.

<b>        QUESTIONER 2
</b>    Do you believe the rumours?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    It's really not my business any more.
    Though I will say, from my experience,
    that rumours about Jeff... do tend to
    be true.

  They love that answer, and all scribble in their note books.
  Next question comes from someone straight right next to
  William.

<b>        QUESTIONER 3
</b>    Last time you were here, there were some
    fairly graphic photographs of you and a
    young English guy -- so what happened
    there?

<b>        ANNA
</b>    He was just a friend -- I think we're
    still friends.

<b>        JEREMY
</b>    Yes, the gentleman in the pink shirt.

  He is pointing straight at William, who has his hand up.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Yes -- Miss Scott -- are there any
    circumstances in which you two might be
    more than just friends?

  Anna sees who it is asking.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm
    assured there aren't.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    And what would you say...

<b>        JEREMY
</b>    No, it's just one question per person.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    No, let him... ask away.  You were
    saying?

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Yes, I just wondered whether if it
    turned out that this... person...

<b>        OTHER JOURNALIST
</b>      (to William)
    His name is Thacker.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    Thanks.  I just wondered if Mr. Thacker
    realized he'd been a daft prick and got
    down on his knees and begged you to
    reconsider, whether you would...
    reconsider.

  We cut to Max, Bella, Bernie and Honey, all watching.  Then back
  to Anna.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.

<b>        WILLIAM
</b>    That's very good news.  The readers of
    'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely
    delighted.

  Anna whispers something to Jeremy.

<b>        JEREMY
</b>    Dominic -- if you'd like to ask your
    question again?

<b>        QUESTIONER 1
</b>    Yes -- Anna -- how long are you
    intending to stay here in Britain?

  Pause.  Anna looks up at William.  He nods.

<b>        ANNA
</b>    Indefinitely.

  They both smile -- suddenly the press gets what's going on --
  music -- noise -- they all turn and flash, flash, flash photos
  of William.  Max and Bella kiss.  Bernie kisses a total stranger.
  Spike finally makes it -- he's bright red from running.

<b>        SPIKE
</b>    What happened?

<b>        HONEY
</b>    It was good.

  Honey hugs him.  It's a new experience for Spike.

  Cut to William's face -- flash after flash -- still looking at
  Anna.  They are both smiling.

<b>  INT./EXT. THE HEMPEL ZEN GARDEN WITH MARQUEEN - DAY
</b>
  Anna and William at their wedding -- they kiss and walk into the
  crowd.

  Honey, a bridesmaid in peach satin -- she is surrounded by at
  least four other bridesmaids, all under five.

  Nearby, Tony standing, glowing, beside his fabulous,
  pyramidical wedding cake.

  William's mother is not quite happy with how he's looking.  She
  tries to brush his hair.

  Max, dressed in the most devastating Bond-like white tuxedo is
  dancing with Anna -- thrilled.  He does a rather flashy little
  move.  Cut to Bella who is watching and laughing.

  Martin, in an awkward tweed suit, is jiggling to the beat of a
  song, entirely happy in the corner.

<b>  EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE - NIGHT
</b>
  A huge premier -- screaming crowds -- Anna and William get out
  of the car, she holding his hand --  looking ultimately gorgeous
  -- he in a black tie that doesn't quite fit.  He's startled.

<b>  EXT. GARDEN - DAY
</b>
  A pretty green communal garden.  Children are playing, watched
  by mothers, one of whom holds a new baby in a papoose.  A very
  old couple wander along slowly.

  A small tai chi group moves mysteriously.  And as the camera
  glides, it passes a couple sitting on a single, simple wooden
  bench overlooking the garden.  He is reading, she is just
  looking out, totally relaxed, holding his hand, pregnant.  It
  is William and Anna.
