</b><b>                                                      6TH MARCH 2008
</b>

<b>          EXT. A MIDSUMMER DAWN. THORNFIELD - THE GROUNDS.
</b>                         
          First light. Jane Eyre is running across a meadow, flushed
          and breathless; the hem of her plain, black dress soaked
          with dew. She carries a shawl and has a small bag of
          belongings over her shoulder.
                         
          She trips, falls to her knees; looks back. Expressive eyes,
          open features. She is desperate. We see the house she is
          running from; a Jacobean battlemented mansion.
                         
          Her need to escape is so great that she crawls forward
          until she is able to raise herself to her feet. She runs.
                         
          She reaches an antique stile by a brook. She lifts herself
          on to it. She lands on the road. And runs.
                         
                         
<b>          I/E. DAY. A ROADSIDE/COACH.
</b>                         
          The sun is higher in the sky. Jane exhausted, now running
          down a main road. Her spirts lift at the sight of an
          approaching coach. She flags it down.
                         
          Jane empties her purse into the driver's hand. He looks at
          her money then suspiciously back at her. A terse nod
          indicates she can get in.
                         
<b>                          CUT TO:
</b>                         
          Jane sinks into a dark corner. Her fellow passengers look
          shocked by her dishevelled appearance at such an early
          hour. She undertakes a tremendous effort not to betray her
          emotional state. She doesn't sob, she doesn't howl -
          although her breathing threatens to. Slowly, unable to bear
          the day, she closes her eyes.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. EVENING. WHITCROSS.
</b>                         
          Sunset. A whitewashed, stone pillar set up where four roads
          meet on a barren moor. The coach driver opens the door.
          With a curt nod he indicates that Jane must get out.
                         
          She looks around, dismayed. In each direction there is open
          moorland for as far as the eye can see. The driver sets off
          at a good pace - glad to be rid of such a passenger. Jane
          puts her hand to her side for her bag of belongings. It is
          not there.
                         
          She runs as fast as she can after the coach. It is receding
          towards the horizon. She comes to a halt, objectless, lost,
          alone. She pulls her knitted shawl around her.
                         
          She leaves the road and sets off across the moor, into the
          gathering dark.
           Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 2.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. NIGHT. THE MOOR.
</b>                         
          Jane is on her knees by a strange overhanging rock. The
          night sky is awesome; the universe is all around her. She
          is trying to calm herself with a prayer.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. DAY. THE MOOR.
</b>                         
          Jane lies on a great rock, soaking up the heat of the sun.
          She is like someone numb with pain. She watches a lizard
          crawl over the rock. She is mesmerised.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. TWILIGHT. THE MOOR.
</b>                         
          Jane squats in the heather and eats bilberries as the light
          fades. She hungrily licks the juice from her hand.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. DAWN. THE MOOR.
</b>                         
          Jane is asleep in the heather, her shawl wrapped around
          her. A red-haired child in a white nightgown lies by her
          side, watching her. It is Helen Burns.
                         
          Helen reaches out. She touches Jane's hand. Jane wakes. She
          sits up. She is alone.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. DAY. BY A RIVER.
</b>                         
          Jane is crouched on a rock watching the waters go by. The
          sky is overcast. The first big drops of rain land on the
          stones. Jane makes no movement.
                         
          A raven lands on a rock nearby. Jane is suddenly filled
          with a wild rage. She picks up a stone and hurls it at the
          bird with a raw cry. The gesture exhausts her. She watches
          the bird wheel away, as the rain starts to pour.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. TWILIGHT. A FARM BY A WOOD.
</b>                         
          It is raining hard. Jane sees a small girl come out of the
          farm with some leftovers. She drops them into a pigpen.
                         
<b>                          CUT TO:
</b>                         
          Jane leaning into the pigpen. She picks a stiffened mould
          of porridge out of the mud. She lets the rain wash it. She
          eats it ravenously.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. NEXT DAY. A WOOD.
</b>                         
          It has stopped raining. Jane is huddled under a tree. She
          is shaking, shuddering. The life has gone out of her eyes.
           Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 3.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. DAY. THE EDGE OF THE WOOD.
</b>                         
          The moors rise away above her to the horizon. Jane looks up
          at the sun starting to set. The clouds are red and gold.
                         
          She sees a small red-haired girl in a white nightgown
          walking barefoot on the moors ahead of her. The girl turns,
          looks back at Jane. With her last strength, Jane follows.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. EVENING. THE MOOR.
</b>                         
          Dark clouds are banking up; the rain starts again. Jane is
          struggling through a marsh. Her boots are stuck.
                         
          She falls. Her hand disappears into mud; her face pressed
          against the earth. She doesn't move. She has reached the
          point of despair.
                         
          The girl's bare feet walk close by, as if waiting for her.
          Jane looks up. Where the child should be, she sees a light
          shining across the moor. Jane starts crawling.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. NIGHT. THE MOOR/MOOR HOUSE.
</b>                         
          Jane is toiling on through the lashing rain towards the
          light. It has become a window. A brief flash of lightning
          shows her a low stone cottage. Helen Burns is sitting on
          the gate.
                         
<b>                          CUT TO:
</b>                         
          Jane is crawling through the narrow garden. On her knees,
          she peers through a window.
                         
          On either side of a bright little fire sit two young women.
          They look exactly like Jane; slight, neat, dressed in
          black. One, Diana, has her hair slightly curled and hides
          her gentle eyes behind spectacles. The other, Mary, is very
          young; no more than seventeen. Each has a book on her knee.
          They are talking intimately.
                         
          They look so close, so loving and the room looks so cosy
          that it pains Jane considerably.

          The questions are deeply troubling to Jane. She is losing
          consciousness.
                         
          She sees an image of a small girl of ten, running away
          through a great darkening room. Jane tries to follow her.
          The action draws her up out of the kitchen chair.
                         
          She hears John Reed's voice again.

          Rain hammers against the windows. Jane aged ten, looking
          hunted, runs in looking for somewhere to hide.
                         
          She springs behind a curtain. John Reed enters; a fourteen
          year old, his stomach bursting out of his fancy clothes. He
          is holding a riding crop as if it is a sword.

          He exits. Jane breathes a sigh of relief. She slowly pulls
          the curtain across, making the window a private sanctuary.
          There is a book lying on the seat. She opens it.

          Jane is sitting cross-legged, completely absorbed in her

          plunging on to a shore.

          Jane has her eyes closed. A great Atlantic wave hits the
          sash window behind her, drenching it with foam and brine.
          Suddenly the curtain is pulled back. John Reed stands in
          front of her. Jane shrinks back.

          Jane stares him out. John can sense her contempt. He belts
          her with the book. Jane hits her head on the window clasp,
          drawing blood. She is shocked.

          Jane snaps. She throws herself upon him, the rage in her
          released; pummelling, scratching, hurting him in any way
          she can. She is barely coherent.

          Jane bites him. Hard. At that moment, Mrs Reed appears on

          Dinah and Mary are gently taking Jane's soaking clothes
          off; one at each side of her. Jane is distressed,
          approaching a delirium. She resists them.

          Jane is carried in and set down on a footstool by two
          servants, Miss Abbot and Bessie - one at each side of her.
          She is still resisting.
                         
<b>                          BESSIE

           be tied down!
                         
          The fight goes out of Jane. She sits, defeated. Bessie,
          young and plump, quickly wipes her bleeding forehead. She
          has some compassion. Miss Abbot has none.
                         
<b>                          BESSIE

           like this, your Aunt Reed will

          The door slams. They are gone. Jane slowly grips the edge
          of the stool. The room is chill, silent. Red walls and
          curtains, murky in the fading light.
                         
          In front of Jane, a stone fireplace gapes like a mouth.
          Beside it, a full length looking-glass in which her pale
          reflection stares out. Behind her, a bed supported on
          pillars of mahogany, hung with red.

          The piled up pillows and mattresses glare in cold white.
          Jane's breathing is the only sound in the room.
                         
          A sudden gust sends rain pelting against the windows like
          fingernails. A distant moan of wind seems to breathe out of
          the black hearth. Jane reverts her nervous gaze to the
          pitted mirror. Her eyes lock on the small figure trapped in
          the mirror's visionary hollow; her white, bleeding face,
          her eyes glittering with fear.
                         
          It is a phantom. The eyes are black, the skin a deathly
          grey. Blood. Jane's breathing becomes choked with terror.
          She can't get her breath. We hear blood rushing through her
          ears. It sounds like the beating of great wings.
                         
          Slowly, a light appears over her. It may be something
          shining in from outside. But to Jane it seems as if it is
          surrounding her, enveloping her. The figure in the looking

</b>           Miss Jane -
                         
          Jane throws her arms around Bessie and embraces her with
          great force. Bessie returns the embrace, surprised, moved.
          Jane gets into the coach. Bessie looks up at the driver.

</b>           You take good care of her.
                         
          Jane's small, pale face peers out of the coach window,
          watching Gateshead recede. She doesn't cry. But Bessie
          can't stave off her tears.

</b>                         
          Jane, half asleep is carried out of a coach and into a
          howling gale. She is taken under a stone inscription:
          `Lowood Institution'. She is set down in front of a woman
          with striking features and intelligent eyes; Miss Temple.
          She bends down and looks into Jane's face.
                         
<b>                          MISS TEMPLE

           alone, Jane Eyre.
                         
          She gently touches Jane's cheek with her finger. Jane
          manages the ghost of a smile.

          Jane is lying back against clean white pillows. Her hair
          brushed and neatly plaited. Diana and Mary are full of
          kindness but St John's face is cold, dispassionate.

</b>           I'll tell you as much as I can. I
           am an orphan; brought up a
           dependent; educated in a charity
           school where I passed six years
           as a pupil and two as a teacher.
           I left a year since to become a
           private governess -

<b>                          DIANA

</b>           I am very sorry to hear it.
                         
          St John has no patience with the change of subject.

</b>           I am free from any blame, sir. I
           was happy.
                         
          Jane is deeply distressed.

</b>           You must rest, Miss Elliott.
                         
          The name sounds strange to Jane.

<b>          INT. EVENING. MOOR HOUSE - THE BEDROOM
</b>                         
          Jane is dressing herself. She stops, weakly holding the
          back of a chair for support, looking out of the window at
          the sun setting over the hills.
                         
<b>           ST JOHN (V.O.)

          St John is praying over Jane, Diana and Mary as they sit at
          the table. Mary catches Jane's eye, gives her shy smile.
                         
<b>                          ST JOHN

           thou, even thou alone, dost
           satisfy him that loveth thee...
                         
          Jane finds herself staring at St John, who prays ardently.
                         
<b>           ST JOHN (CONT'D)
</b>           And without thee all things are
           vain and empty. Amen.
                         
          St John opens his eyes and looks searchingly at Jane. She
          immediately looks down.

          Miss Scatcherd's bitter life is in her face and voice.

</b>           Burns, Helen Burns!
                         
          Jane, aged ten, looks up. She is wearing a brown stuff
          frock with a puritanical cap like all the other girls.
          Silence reigns in the school hall.
                         
          A red haired girl of about thirteen stands up; Helen Burns.
          Miss Scatcherd holds up an apron in which a hole has been
          mistakenly cut.
                         
<b>           MISS SCATCHERD (CONT'D)
</b>           You're a slattern and a disgrace!
                         
          Helen Burns undoes the back of her dress. The punishment is
          given; a dozen sharp, stinging whacks with the birch twigs.
                         
          Jane is appalled. But to her astonishment and awe, Helen
          Burns doesn't cry; she barely changes her expression. As
          the strokes go on - seven, eight, nine - Helen seems like
          one in a trance. Jane is deeply affected.
                         
          On the eleventh stroke, the door bursts open and a visiting
          party walks in: the Brocklehurst family. Miss Temple
          escorts two young girls dressed in peacock finery and two
          smart, bombastic ladies. Mr Brocklehurst follows. Helen's
          punishment is forgotten as the students rush to their feet.
                         
          Jane, in a panic, drops her slate and breaks it.

          Helen, as if fiercely protecting her. Helen is ashen, her

          voluptuous woman in an 18th Century gown, ruby lipped, one
          full breast exposed. Jane glances away, taken aback by the
          woman's bold expression and her nakedness.

          Adele adopts a lovelorn pose. She sings an operetta song; a
          forsaken lady plotting vengeance on her lover. Her high
          voice warbles with pretended emotion. The effect is rather
          weird. Jane and Mrs Fairfax watch, open-mouthed.

          Adele's song continues as a voiceover. Mrs Fairfax is
          finishing a shawl. Jane is showing Adele pictures of little
          objects that she has sketched. Adele names them in English.
                         
          The song ends. Jane gives Adele a sketch of herself.

          Jane holds a candle, the shawl around her; the moaning
          sound of a gale outside. She holds her candle up to the
          portrait of the voluptuous woman.
                         
          She stares at it curious, both as a girl and as an artist.
          She brings the candle close, to see how the brushwork has
          achieved the effect of flesh. She hears a low, knowing
          laugh in the darkness behind her. She is startled.

          Her own huge shadow is the only thing that moves. She hears
          the laugh again. She follows it through the darkness, alert
          with fear. A door clicks shut at the end of the corridor.
                         
          To her relief Jane sees Mrs Fairfax approach with a lamp.

           Grace? Grace!
                         
          A door opens. Jane sees a broad-faced woman with slow,
          intelligent eyes. She looks as if she has just woken up.

          Grace looks at Jane with sly curiosity. She leaves the
          sewing room and opens a door through which a flight of
          steep steps are revealed. Grace climbs them and disappears.

          Jane senses a presence behind her. She quickly turns. Mrs

          Jane is walking with purpose, carrying a bundle of letters.
          The exercise is lifting her spirits. The sun is sinking,
          turning the frost gold.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. DAY. A FROZEN WOOD.
</b>                         
          A brook runs close to the path; half frozen. Its slow
          trickle is the only sound to be heard. Jane moves slowly,
          acutely aware of everything around her.
                         
          Further into the wood, the brook has frozen right across
          the path. Jane slips on it as she passes. The noise of her
          feet echoes. She steadies herself.
                         
          She gazes at a huddle of snowdrops, their heads bowed. A
          crystal drop of water runs to the end of a snowdrop and
          begins to freeze as she watches. It is held suspended as if
          the whole winter is contained in it.
                         
          The moon is mounting the sky. Jane hears a sound like the
          beating of wings. The blood is rushing through her ears.
                         
          Her trance is broken by the figure of a great dog - which
          glides past her so close it almost knocks her off her feet.
          The beating is loud; not wings she realises, but the rush
          of an approaching horse. It is almost on top of her before
          she can move. Her shocked, pale face, her black garments
          startle both horse and rider.

          The rider gets the horse under control and continues, only
          to have his horse slip on the ice. Both man and horse fall
          with a crash. The dog begins to bark, until the hills echo
          with the sound. The horse is on one side; the man is lying,
          trapped beneath it on the ice; Edward Fairfax Rochester.

          Rochester stares at her; a tiny black figure, surrounded by
          darkening frost, the low moon behind her.

          Jane doesn't move. Rochester turns to his horse.

          With much stamping and clattering, the horse clambers to
          its feet. Rochester seems relieved.
                         
          He tries to stand himself. His ankle will bear no weight.
          He lets out an involuntary cry. It echoes:

          Rochester looks at her once more. He manages to get himself
          off the ice. He sits on a nearby stile. Jane approaches
          him. She now has the moon on her face. She begins to look
          less like a phantom and more like a girl.

          Rochester is trying to place her. She is a puzzle to him.

          Examining Jane once more, he laughs a low laugh.

          Jane doesn't like his imperious tone. She looks at the
          horse; huge, trampling, nervous. Rochester is amused.

          Jane obeys. She endeavours to catch the bridle but the
          horse rears away. Jane falls on the ice. Rochester bursts
          out laughing. Jane picks herself up.

          Jane resists.

           come here.
                         
          Jane approaches. Rochester instantly leans all his weight
          on her. She almost crumples under it; the first time she
          has ever touched and been touched by a man. She holds him
          up. And walks him closer to his horse.

          The horse approaches him. Rochester calms it. He springs
          into the saddle, grimacing as he wrenches his sprain.

          Rochester's spurred heel makes the horse start and rear.
          Jane steps back. The horse bounds away, the dog rushing in
          its traces. All three disappear.
                         
          Jane doesn't move until the sound of hooves has faded away.
          Her face is flushed, her eyes glitter in the dark.

          Jane runs up to the front door. She pushes it open. To her
          amazement, there is a fire burning in the stone fireplace.
          The whole hall is lit. The double doors are open into the
          library. Mrs Fairfax is hurriedly approaching.

           He's in a terrible humour; the
           doctor has been. His horse fell
           in Hay lane and his ankle is
           sprained.
                         
          Mrs Fairfax anxiously hurries back into the library. A
          large dog wanders out. Jane finds herself looking at Pilot.
          She smiles.

          Jane enters. Rochester is in front of a superb fire - one
          foot bandaged and supported on a stool. Pilot is at his
          feet - and so is Adele, gazing adoringly at him.
                         
          Rochester is looking through Jane's portfolio of sketches
          and watercolours. Jane feels utterly exposed - as if her
          diary is being read. Mrs Fairfax timidly interrupts.

          at the battlements. A shape disappears, too fast to see.
          Rochester's features cloud over with an expression of shame

          She stares into the mirror, searching the pale face of her
          reflection, as if trying to find an answer. A murmur seems

          There is a single candle burning in its holder on the rush
          matting, flickering in the draft. Jane picks it up. She
          notices something else - a curling wreath of grey smoke.
          She follows its trail through the pitch darkness. It is
          coming thickly from a half-open door at the front of the
          house - Rochester's.
                         
          Jane rushes in. Rochester's bed is on fire; the hangings,
          the curtains, all are alight. The flames are leaping.

          pulls the burning sheets off - then stops; he is naked. She
          takes his basin and douses the bed - soaking him.

          pulls the soggy fabric from its rail and smothers the
          burning couch. When all the flames are out, she rushes to
          the windows and opens them. Smoke billows out. She stands
          in the moonlight, coughing.

          is trying to resist.

          Jane is keeling on the windowsill, looking out at the
          rising sun. She is lit by its glowing rays; inspired. It's
          a rare feeling that prompts her mood, as new and unfolding
          as the day itself - happiness.

</b>           It's hardly likely the master
           would laugh when he was in such

           So tall, with raven hair cascading
           down her back; I don't know how

           and work; free and honest. I

<b>                          ST JOHN
</b>           We can overcome every kind of human

           intensely miserable. I considered
           my life was so wretched that it
           must be changed - or I would die.

           thing that would ever touch my
           soul. I scorned the weakness,
           fought hard against it - and won.

          Jane wears a housekeeper's apron over her dress. She enters
          Rochester's room with an armful of bed linen. It has been
          returned to its former glory. Adele is jumping up and down
          on the bed. Sophie is trying to coax her off it. Jane gives
          Sophie the sheets.
                         
          Adele leaves the room with Jane and skids all the way down
          the newly polished gallery in her stockinged feet. Jane
          can't help smiling.

          Jane sets down several bottles of wine on the kitchen table
          in order to dust them. The kitchen is a hive of activity -
          except for one lone figure sitting quietly in a chair by
          the fire, smoking a pipe; Grace Poole. Leah and one of the
          hired under cooks are talking abut her.

          Leah notices Jane's curious glance. She nudges the under
          cook. Jane, picks up the bottles and carries them away. As
          she passes she hears:

          flustered. Jane helps her.

</b>           Thank you.
                         
          Mrs Fairfax and Adele go. Jane looks out of the window.
                         
          Her attention is focussed on two equestrians who lead the
          arriving party; Rochester and Blanche, the dark beauty at
          his side. She is laughing at something. The sun shines
          behind her. Jane is dazzled. She turns away.
                         
                         
<b>          INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE SECOND FLOOR.
</b>                         
          Jane comes up the back stairs and on to the gallery, just
          as the ladies start to issue from their rooms. She stands
          back in a dark corner.
                         
          There is an approach of chatter; a subdued vivacity. A
          flurry of multicoloured silks, lace and velvets go by. They
          descend the staircase as noiselessly as a bright mist.
                         
          Jane steps out. She walks right into the path of Blanche
          Ingram, who is dressed in white. They both startle.
                         
<b>                          JANE
</b>           Excuse me, miss.
                         
          Blanche gives her a look of ice. Rochester is at the top of
          the stairs.

</b>           Good evening.
                         
          They both turn. Rochester has seen Blanche, not Jane. He
          offers her his arm, his gaze full of admiration. Jane sinks
          back into the shadows.

          Blanche lays her gloved hand on Rochester's arm, barely
          touching him. They glide away.

          Adele and Jane sit on the stairs, listening to Blanche and
          Rochester sing. Their voices thrill. Jane is trying not to
          feel. But when Rochester hits an exceptionally beautiful
          note, she involuntarily closes her eyes.
                         
          Adele leans into Jane. She is crying.

          Adele makes a dainty curtsey - pink frock, hair in
          ringlets, little lace gloves. In the midst of the crowd is
          Blanche.

          Adele blissfully disappears into a moving sea of dresses.
          Only one guest is still looking in Jane's direction;
          Blanche. Her lip curls in distaste.
                         
          Jane backs into a nearby window seat; always her place of
          refuge. She closes her eyes. A great Atlantic wave hits the
          sash window behind her, drenching it with foam and brine.
                         
          When she opens her eyes, Rochester is in her line of
          vision, standing out in a crowd of unmanly men. He senses
          her gaze; glances at her. Jane looks down, pulling her work
          on to her lap; a beaded purse. She does not lift her eyes
          from the beads, fully feeling the humiliation of her class -
          and of her love. Blanche sidles up to Rochester.

          Jane closes the door on Blanche. She breathes in fresh air,

          Rochester comes into the hall from the other door. Jane
          instantly bends down and pretends to be tying her shoe.

          She sees a man rising to meet Rochester; handsome but gaunt
          and painfully thin. His smile doesn't reach his eyes - as

          starts to cry. Jane panics.
                         
          The crying becomes deafening, terrifying. It is not a

          Jane wakes, hearing a savage, sharp shriek of such power
          and intensity it seems to tear the night in two.
                         
          Overhead, the sounds of a struggle begin - a deadly one.
          Jane hears footsteps rush past her door. She starts to pull
          on her dress. She hears a man's voice from above:

          A great stamp on the floor above; something falls with a
          thud; silence. Jane grabs her candle and leaves her room.
                         
          The guests likewise are all issuing from their rooms; some
          with candles, some stumbling into the dark. The gallery is
          filling with terrified ladies and shocked gentlemen. Their
          shadows dance grotesquely on the walls.

          The candles flicker and fade as the guests make their way

          He unlocks it. A room hung with tapestries; a four poster
          bed with its curtains half drawn. One part of the tapestry
          is hooked up over a hidden door - which lies open to an
          inner chamber. A dull, sickly light shines out.

          Jane obeys. Richard Mason is lying, one arm and all the
          linen soaked in blood. Jane controls her reaction and makes
          herself useful. Rochester is cleaning the wound.

          She dips the sponge in the bloody water and wipes away the

          puts her hand upon it, gently, as if thanking her uncle for

          She turns a corner and sees Rochester staring intently at

          A form emerges, a woman, tall and gaunt, with thick, black
          hair hanging down her back. She is dressed in a nightgown -
          like a shroud. Over her head, she wears Jane's bridal veil;
          a phantom bride.
                         
          Jane is paralysed with terror.
                         
          The form takes the veil and slowly tears it in half;
          bruised arms, dirt, predatory nails, neglect. The last
          thing to be revealed is the woman's face, pale and ghastly.
          Her eyes are glittering with hatred.
                         
          The figure takes the candle and bends down to Jane. Her

          Rochester is striding purposefully towards a small church
          of ancient design. Jane stumbles. Rochester is contrite.
                         
          Jane tries to collect herself. She looks up to the sky. The
          rook wheels around the spire. She takes Rochester's hand.

          At the altar, Jane glances at Rochester. He is looking
          straight ahead at the clergyman, Wood.

          The figure by the door steps out of the shadows. It is

          A grim smile contorts Rochester's lips. He turns towards
          Jane. She remains where she was abandoned - at the altar -
          tiny, under he vaulted arch. The bouquet falls from her
          hand. Rochester walks to her.

           with a defrauded wretch.
                         
          A tiny breath is the only noise Jane utters. Rochester
          pulls her from the altar to his side.

          Mrs Fairfax, Adele, Sophie, Martha and Leah are waiting.
          Adele runs forward. Rochester stops her in her tracks.

          Adele has crumpled into frightened tears. Mrs Fairfax has
          her hand over her mouth, pale with shock. Jane meets her
          eye as Rochester pulls her up the stairs. A revelation.

          The tapestried room. Rochester glances at Mason. He unlocks
          the inner door with one hand; the other won't let go of
          Jane. Grace Poole sits by a strongly guarded fire, stirring
          something in a pot.
                         
          Rochester leads Jane and the men into the room. There is no
          window, no furniture except for Grace's chair; only a
          mattress on the floor.

          Bertha Antoinetta Mason stands, amazed at the sight of her
          visitors. She wears a white shift. There are black rook
          feathers twined in her hair; her only ornament.

          Bertha's pose is dignified, her expression grows
          triumphant. She approaches Rochester - her eyes locked with
          Jane's. Jane gazes: fear, disgust, compassion.

          Bertha puts her arm through Rochester's; lays her head on
          his shoulder; smiles at Jane, magnanimous in her victory.

          With shocking speed and strength Bertha lays her nails into
          Rochester's cheek. He struggles with her.
                         
          Grace assists Rochester. They do not hit; they subdue.
          Bertha's attack is effectively contained. They have her on
          her knees, her arms behind her.
                         
          Bertha lifts her head and screams. If a scream could
          express the agony of a whole soul then this would. Jane
          turns on her heels. She stumbles, finds the door, exits.

          Rochester buries his head in Jane's arms. She automatically
          comforts him.

          Rochester perceives Jane's inanition. He carries her down
          the gallery. Jane clings on to her bag of belongings. She
          has nothing else left.

          Rochester has lain Jane in front of the fire. She forces
          herself to eat. Rochester gives her wine. She sips.

           again soon.
                         
          Rochester paces away to the fire. He comes back. Stoops his
          head down to Jane to kiss her. She turns her head away.

</b>           It's not because she's mad that I

           still. You are my sympathy, my
           better self, my angel. I will wrap
           my whole existence round you. Let
           us leave here tomorrow. Come with
           me - as my wife.

<b>                          ROCHESTER
</b>           I was tricked, duped into wedlock
           with that demon-hate, that harlot,
           that succubus upstairs. My father
           wanted her money and so I was sent
           to Spanish Town and the match was
           made. I hardly spoke with her. I
           was dazzled, ignorant, raw. My
           senses were besotted and I married
           her - gross, grovelling mole-eyed
           blockhead that I was.
                         
          Rochester sits, staring at the fire.

</b>           I lived with her for four years.
           She dragged me through all the
           degrading agonies which attend
           those bound to the intemperate and
           unchaste. Her excesses developed
           germs of madness and the doctors
           shut her up. One night, unable to
           bear her screaming hate and knowing
           I could never be rid of her, I put
           a gun to my head to kill myself.
                         
          Jane is both appalled and moved.
                         
<b>                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
</b>           I would have pulled the trigger,
           died in that tropical place but for
           a breeze which blew in from the sea
           and smelt of home. With it, I came
           to my senses. Bertha Antoinetta
           Mason had abused my long suffering,
           sullied my name, outraged my honour
           and blighted my youth. It was
           enough. At that moment, as I
           decided to live, she ceased to be
           my wife.

</b>           Only my father and brother knew of
           the marriage and by then they were
           both dead. I let my connection with
           her be buried in oblivion and I
           brought her here. I have seen that
           she's cared for as her condition
           demands and that is all that God
           and humanity asks.

          All the life seems to go out of Rochester. He lets Jane go.
          She pulls herself away from him. She stands. He remains,
          his face buried.
                         
          She goes to the door. Rochester turns his eyes to her.

          First light. Jane is running; flushed, breathless, her
          dress soaked with dew. She has her bag of belongings over
          her shoulder. She trips; falls to her knees.
                         
          She looks back. For a moment she seems paralysed. She
          returns her gaze to the route ahead. Her need to escape is
          so great that she crawls forwards until she is able to
          raise herself to her feet.
                         
          She reaches the stile; lifts herself on to it; puts her
          arms around the post. She holds it, as if it were beloved.
          Her eyes close. We hear the sound of a winter blizzard.

          Jane opens her eyes. She is sitting at her fireside.
          Outside, a snowstorm howls. On her knee is a sketchbook.
          She looks down at it.
                         
          Rochester's dark eye is beginning to appear on her paper.
          She puts a line through it; scribbles it out, blinding him.
          She stands up, trying to escape her thoughts. She whispers:

          Jane pulls him inside. She falls into his arms. They
          embrace passionately. Jane is actively pulling him towards
          her, delirious with love and longing.

          snatches it away too late. There is a moment of silence.

</b>           Twenty years ago, a poor curate
           fell in love with a rich man's
           daughter and married her. She was
           disowned by her family and two
           years later the rash pair were both
           dead. They left a daughter which
           charity received into her lap - as
           cold as that snow drift I almost
           stuck fast in. Charity carried the
           friendless thing to the house of
           its rich maternal relations. It was
           reared by an aunt-in-law; I come to
           names now - Mrs Reed of Gateshead.

</b>           It seems her career there was very
           honourable. She became a teacher
           like yourself, and left it, like
           yourself, to be a governess. She
           undertook the education of the ward
           of a certain Mr Rochester -

</b>           I can guess your feelings but hear
           me to the end. Of Mr Rochester's
           character I know nothing but he
           professed to offer honourable
           marriage to this young girl and at
           the very altar she discovered that
           he had a wife yet alive. His
           subsequent conduct is a matter of
           pure conjecture but when the
           governess was enquired after it was
           discovered that she had fled
           Thornfield Hall and no trace of her
           has since been found. Now isn't

          St John opens his pocket book and removes a piece of paper.
                         
<b>           ST JOHN (CONT'D)

           in black and white.
                         
          He hands her the paper. On it are doodled the heads of some
          of her pupils. She has absently written Jane Eyre in the
          margin several times.

          Jane is sitting at the table letting Diana style her hair.
          They all have new summer dresses on. There is a lightness
          to all three as if a great weight has been lifted from
          their shoulders.

          Jane is walking through forest, along a grass grown track.
          Her pace is fast; her journey almost at an end. She comes
          to a pair of rusting iron gates hanging open between
          granite pillars. She walks through them.
                         
          She finds herself in front of a decrepit Elizabethan manor
          house; no garden, just a sweeping semi circle of meadow
          grass, which someone has cut at with a scythe. Jane stops.
                         
          Standing on the threshold is Edward Fairfax Rochester. He
          is in his shirtsleeves. He stands strong, stalwart,
          brooding. His hair is still raven black. He is looking
          sightlessly around his domain, with the concentration of a
          hawk. His strength is undiminished.
                         
          He walks fifteen paces from the house. It brings him into
          the middle of the semicircle of grass. He is close enough
          for Jane to see his scarred eyes. She walks towards him,
          silent.
                         
          A few drops of rain begin to fall. Rochester puts out his
          right hand to feel them. He raises his face up to the sky
          as if he is looking for something from there. He is
          absolutely still; his expression, serene.
                         
          Jane is very close. She steps on a twig. It breaks with a
          loud crack, shattering the silence. Rochester is
          immediately on guard, his expression turning wary.

          He suddenly swipes the air with his left arm; the ruin of
          it passing an inch from her face. Jane steps back.
          Rochester swipes again. She holds her breath.
                         
          He seems satisfied at last that nothing is there. He turns
          and walks fifteen paces back to the house. He disappears
          into the dark interior.
                         
          Jane starts to breathe again.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. DAY. FERNDEAN - THE SIDE ENTRANCE.
</b>                         
          Jane lightly taps on the side door. Martha opens it; she is
          astonished. Jane puts her finger over her lips.
                         
                         
<b>          INT. EVENING. FERNDEAN - THE DRAWING ROOM.
</b>                         
          Rochester is in an armchair in front of his fire. Pilot is
          at his feet. Jane carries in a tray with a candelabra and a
          jug of water.
                         
<b>                          ROCHESTER
</b>           I can see the candles, Martha, at
           your side like a luminous glow.
           And the fire; a red haze.
                         
          Pilot notices Jane. He leaps up with a whine, wagging his
          tail, madly. Jane spills half the water. She cannot help
          finding it funny. Her entrance has been ruined by the dog.
                         
<b>                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
</b>           Martha?
                         
          Jane giggles. Rochester's face falls.
                         
<b>                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

<b>                          JANE
</b>           Martha is in the kitchen, sir.

<b>                          JANE
</b>           Pilot knows me. Will you have
           some more water? I've spilt half
           the glass.
                         
          Rochester stands, holding out his hand.
                         
<b>                          ROCHESTER
</b>           If you are real, touch me.
                         
          Jane touches his fingers; puts her hand in his. Rochester
          pulls her into his arms.
