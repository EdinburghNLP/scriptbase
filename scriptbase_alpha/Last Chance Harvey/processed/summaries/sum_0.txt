Harvey Shine is in London for the weekend for his daughter's wedding.
His work in New York preoccupies him: he writes music for ads, and he knows his boss is pushing him aside for younger talent.
With family he's also on the sidelines - long divorced, his wife remarried, her husband closer to his daughter than he.
His path crosses that of Kate Walker, unmarried, her life becoming that of a spinster, set up by friends on blind dates leading nowhere.
After Harvey's no good terrible day, he chats Kate up at a Heathrow bar.
She's not interested.
Where can this conversation lead?
Back at his daughter's reception, the step-father rises to give a toast.
