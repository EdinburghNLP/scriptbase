                                   Judd Apatow





                                                        April 29, 2008

<b>          INT. BEL AIR HOME - NIGHT
</b>
          GEORGE SIMMONS, 42, sits in a giant living room watching bad
          television on a 70-inch flat screen TV. He looks bored and
          empty. After a few beats he pauses the TV, and picks up the
          phone.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          (on the phone)
          Hey, it's George Simmons, I'm
          coming in.

<b>          INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
</b>
          Shots of George doing stand up on stage at a comedy club.
          The place adores him. We see quick images of him after the
          show interacting with people. He is clearly a very famous
          comedian.

<b>          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          George has sex with a girl in her early twenties.

<b>          INT. BEL AIR HOME - NIGHT
</b>
          George sits back down, the thrill of his performance is gone,
          he is bored and alone again. He hits play on his TV and
          begins watching his show from the same spot it was at before.

</b>
<b>          INT. BEL AIR HOME - BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
          GEORGE wakes up in a large, clean, modern house. He is all
          alone. We get the feeling that he hired someone to decorate
          his house. It is very nice, but doesn't seem personal to him
          at all. It feels new, with all the gadgets, but a little
          cold. On the kitchen table is a stack of scripts he is
          supposed to read.

<b>          EXT. GEORGE'S HOME - MORNING
</b>
          George hits balls in his home batting cage. Then we see him
          driving golf balls inside there. In the background we see
          his modern, space ship looking house. It is enormous.

</b>
<b>          INT. BATHROOM - LATER
</b>
          George walks into a fancy, steam-filled shower.

<b>          EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
</b>
          George drives his large black Mercedes.

<b>          EXT. MEDICAL TOWER - DAY
</b>
          George gets out of his car and walks towards the tower. Two
          COLLEGE STUDENTS walk over.

<b>          COLLEGE STUDENT
</b>          Hey George, can I get a picture
          with you?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Sure buddy. Let's do it.
          One of the college students put his arm around George while
          the other takes the picture.

<b>          COLLEGE STUDENT #2
</b>          Can I get one?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Yeah bud.
          They take the picture.

<b>          COLLEGE STUDENT
</b>          You're the man. We love all your
          movies, even the last one.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Thanks. Tell your friends.

<b>          INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
          George sits in the doctor's office staring at the photos of
          the doctor with his beautiful young children. DOCTOR STEVENS
          enters and sits down. He takes a deep breath.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I like those lunestas. They really
          put me to sleep without giving me
          the sleeping pill hangover I get
          from the restorils.

</b>
<b>          GEORGE (COIN ' D )
</b>
<b>          (BEAT)
</b>          I try not to take them too often.
          Just when I know I have to get up
          early.

<b>          DOCTOR STEVENS
</b>          George there are some
          irregularities in your blood
          work...
          George's face turns white. He knows what this means. The
          doctor keeps talking but the sound keeps coming in and out--
          it is now all a jumble of words.

<b>          ANGLE ON GEORGE'S POV
</b>          We see photos of the doctor's family, his graduation
          certificates, files of other cases, odd doctor's office art,
          a picture of him skiing with his family. He keeps talking,
          but now we hear nothing.

<b>          EXT. MEDICAL TOWER - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
          George walks down the stairs towards the parking lot in a
          daze. An ASIAN GIRL and her MOTHER and BROTHER see him and
          start screaming.

<b>          GIRL
</b>          Oh my God. Can you take a picture
          with me?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Yeah, sure.
          She puts her arm around him. Her little brother jumps in
          too.

<b>          GIRL
</b>          Thanks. You are the funniest.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Thanks, pal.

<b>          !NT. CAR - DAY
</b>          George drives home. We hear the voice of his doctor in his
          head.

<b>          4.
</b>
<b>          DOCTOR STEVENS (V.0.)
</b>          It's a rare blood disorder. In the
          family of Hodgkins disease. We
          really don't have a treatment for
          it. There are things we can try.
          They're all very experimental in
          nature.

<b>          GEORGE (V.0.)
</b>          I don't understand what this means.

<b>          DOCTOR STEVENS (V.0.)
</b>          I think you need to hope for the
          best and prepare for the worst. Is
          there someone who can help you get
          your affairs in order?

<b>          INT. RALPH'S SUPERMARKET - DAY
</b>
          IRA, a 25-year-old, works at the deli counter, along with
          CHUCK, a large, sweet-looking 45-year-old deli counter lifer,
          and GAIL, a very skinny, very old, straight-talking,
          humorless woman in her fifties.
          Ira is in the middle of a very long conversation with a
          middle-aged WOMAN.

<b>          WOMAN
</b>          Is the turkey organic?

<b>          IRA
</b>          Yes, ma'am.

<b>          WOMAN
</b>          Well what does organic mean?

<b>          IRA
</b>          It means there's no additives or
          preservatives and it's hormone
          free.

<b>          WOMAN
</b>          Are there additives or
          preservatives in the food they feed
          the turkey?

<b>          IRA
</b>          I don't know ma'am.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          5.
</b>
<b>          WOMAN
</b>          I heard that because turkeys are
          fatty birds, mercury gets stuck in
          their fat. My daughter-in-law, she
          ate turkey and then she had a
          miscarriage.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I haven't heard about that. But I
          may not be informed enough to
          comment.

<b>          WOMAN
</b>          Well, you're not a doctor, so you
          shouldn't comment.

<b>          IRA
</b>          You are correct, I am not a doctor.

<b>          INT. DELI COUNTER - LATER
</b>
          Ira and Chuck are preparing trays of food.

<b>          IRA
</b>          You should come see me do stand-up
          tonight at the Comedy and Magic
          Club.

<b>          CHUCK
</b>          I can't go through that again, man,
          that was painful.

<b>          IRA
</b>          That was five months ago. I've
          gotten a lot better.

<b>          CHUCK
</b>          They pay you yet?

<b>          IRA
</b>          Nah, not there. I just hang out and
          hope somebody doesn't show.

<b>          CHUCK
</b>          Wow, is there anyway for you to.be
          lower in show business? I don't
          know if you could even say you're
          in show business. Why don't you
          just fucking settle down and enjoy
          this gig? This is a sweet
          situation. The money's good,
          you've got health insurance.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Dude, I know you like it here but
          if I have to work here another year
          I would kill myself.

<b>          CHUCK
</b>          Really? In that case, when we bury
          you does it have to be in some kind
          of Jew cemetery? Next to Al Jolson
          or some shit?

<b>          IRA
</b>          Just come. I need the support.

<b>          CHUCK
</b>          No way. I'm funnier than you. And
          I'm not even that funny. I would go
          if I was paying to see me.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I'll pay your cover charge.

<b>          CHUCK
</b>          Okay, well you better be good,
          because I'm bringing a date.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Laughter's the ultimate lubricant.

<b>          INT. BEL AIR HOME - DUSK
</b>
          An Otis Redding song is playing as George walks around his
          house in a daze, not sure how to process this. He doesn't

          thinking about the unthinkable and the life he's lead.
          He sits in his office, surrounded by photos of himself at
          difference ages. It builds to a sequence of him going
          through stacks of old photos and watching videos of himself,
          reviewing his life, trying to make sense of what it all
          meant. We see clips of his good movies and his last bad
          movie. On the wall is a poster of a buddy film which shows
          him and another famous comedian.

</b>
          Ira sits with one of his roommates, LEO, who is also an
          aspiring comedian. They sit across from each other, kicking
          around joke ideas they have, trying to write new ones. We
          see an entire pitch session play out.
          Ira's joke pitches are all over the place. He clearly hasn't
          figured out what his stage persona is yet.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I was thinking about doing
          something about how I'm not good
          looking and I'm not bad looking.
          I'm just good looking enough that
          if I had a good personality, it
          could put me over the top. If that
          was the case.

<b>          LEO
</b>          Yeah, something about how the
          uglier you are, the better the
          personality you need. And the
          hotter you are, the stupider you
          can be.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I had a joke once about how you
          never see incredibly hot, blonde,
          homeless women. Because someone
          will always take care of that kind
          of woman. That woman could be the
          dumbest person on earth and she
          will survive in this world.

<b>          LEO
</b>          Maybe something like... you can be
          hot and stupid and survive in the
          world. And you can be smart and
          ugly and survive in the world. The
          people who have trouble are the
          stupid, ugly people.

</b>          Let me keep that one, because I
          thought of most of it.

<b>          IRA
</b>          That's not cool. I came up with
          the concept! What do you got?
          Let's work on what you have.

<b>          LEO
</b>          I've got nothing in the notebook.
          I got drunk last night. But I need
          material, because I just got spots
          at the Improv. Budd saw me and
          approved me. I'm in.

          Their other roommate, MARK, walks in, waves a check at them.

<b>          MARK
</b>          Hey, dudes. You see this check
          that I got from my TV show for
          25,000 an episode? There was
          another one of these on the kitchen
          counter. Did you see it?

<b>          IRA

          plan.

<b>          MARK
</b>          I'll give you ten days for your

          Ira walks in.

</b>          Hey Ira, this is Daisy.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Nice to meet you. I think I gave
          you quarters once.
          Ira walks over to the kitchen area, takes out a paper cup.
          He pours some orange juice without looking and the paper cup
          falls over and spills all over the counter. Mark looks
          horrified.

<b>          IRA (CONT'D)
</b>          (nervously joking)
          Don't worry, I'll just lick it off
          the counter.
          Nobody laughs. Ira starts wiping up the OJ with a rag.

          Leo is on stage, performing his act, doing well.
          ANGLE ON Ira watching, both amused and jealous. A MAGICIAN
          and the EMCEE walks over to him.

</b>          Schneider didn't show up so, you
          can do ten minutes after Leo.

<b>          MAGICIAN
</b>          Don't go long because I have to

</b>          I'll have him unload the pigeons.

          Leo finishes his set to huge applause then comes off stage.

</b>          That was good, right? Some of the
          new stuff worked.

          George walks on stage. The place goes crazy. He does some
          of his normal routine and the audience laughs and is very
          appreciative.
          As George continues his act, it starts getting darker and
          darker until he is talking about death and the lack of
          meaning in it all.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Ah life. What does it mean?

</b>          Life isn't all about laughs. Crazy

</b>          Sorry I sucked it up out there. At
          least they are well rested for you.
          Ira, takes the stage. He starts trying to do his act, but he
          is unsure of himself and unable to figure out how to take the
          weird energy of the room and spin it to his advantage. He
          basically bombs. We reveal Chuck and his date watching,
          looking miserable.

</b>          I'm not good looking. I'm not bad
          looking. I'm just in the middle.
          And if I had a personality that was
          Jut good enough, it would put me
          over the edge.
          The joke fails. We reveal George also watching him bomb,
          amused by his struggle. He sees something he likes in Ira.

          Ira walks to his car. In the spot next to him is an enormous
          Suburban SUV parked in a spot meant for compact cars. It is
          so close to Ira's car that it isn't possible to open the
          door. He hears some banging and odd wails from in the car.
          Ira knocks on the window. We see that George is sitting in
          his car in a world of pain. He's clearly been crying. The
          knock startles him. He turns to Ira.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Sorry, man. I didn't mean to
          disturb you. I just can't open my
          door. There's no room.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Oh I'm sorry. Let me pull out.
          George pulls the car back ten feet.

</b>          Thanks!

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Man, that audience hated you. They
          really did not like you. They liked
          your buddy, who looked exactly like
          you but was funnier. Man, that's
          going to haunt you. You're going
          to wake up in six months and think
          about this night.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Well, I'll probably bomb worse
          tomorrow and forget about this one.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I'm just fucking with you. You had
          some funny jokes in there. Good

<b>          IRA
</b>          Well, obviously, I'm a... you

          George pulls out, turns the car around, and as he passes by
          Ira, he steers his car as if he's going to run him down, and
          starts screaming...

          same time. And you guys made that
          possible.
          We see QUICK IMAGES of him typing and printing. He is
          writing an enormous amount of jokes. Way more than George
          will ever need. Writing, typing, re-writing in pen, then re-
          typing, etc.
          Ira hesitates, then hits send.

</b>          There's some funny shit in here.
          Not a bad ratio of good jokes to
          shit.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Thanks man. I just want to give
          you a lot of choices.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Too many choices. I don't like
          reading that much. I need like ten
          good jokes. I'm a little mad you
          made me read that many to get to
          ten. But thanks for doing it.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Oh, it was fun to try to write in
          your voice. I spent the whole
          night pretending I was you.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          So you cried yourself to sleep?

<b>          (ALT)
</b>          So you whacked off three times last

          some money. Is five hundred good?

<b>          IRA
</b>          Yeah! That'll work.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I'm leaving at four tomorrow to go

<b>          IRA
</b>          Yeah, this'll be fun.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I think I'm going to have you go on
          before me to warn them up.

<b>          IRA
</b>          You don't have to do that. What if
          I bomb?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Hey, if you bomb, they'll just be
          more excited to see me. They'll be
          so glad your not on stage any more.
          Then if you do well, they'll be
          ready for me. Either way, you're
          helpful.

</b>          The limo pulls up to a private jet. Ira is shocked.
          A moment later they're picking up speed to take off. George
          seems really relaxed. Nothing registers that the jet is
          going faster and faster and taking off.

</b>          I like this joke about watching

</b>          You want something to eat? I had

          It's a giant room that holds a thousand people at banquet
          tables.
          ON STAGE - Sting is finishing up a set. This is a huge
          corporate event.

<b>          DAVE
</b>          Okay, what do you want them to say
          when he introduces you? Do you
          have any credits he should mention?

<b>          IRA
</b>          (long beat)
          Uh...credits? I don't really have
          any credits. Maybe you could just
          say I've been working on Apples for
          so long, my first one weighed more
          than I did.
          Nobody laughs.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          And just say he's a friend of mine,

<b>          INT. STAGE - LATER
</b>
          Ira's on stage doing his act. He tells two jokes that don't
          do very well. And then he panics and does the joke about
          jerking off and shooting a movie all at the same time.
          ANGLE ON George, shaking his head, amused that he panicked
          and did one of the jokes he sold to him.
          CUT TO the wings of the stage.
          Ira's walking off stage.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          What the fuck is that? You did
          three of the jokes that you wrote
          for me.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I panicked. They just wanted jokes
          about computers.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          That's why I hired you, to write
          jokes about computers.
          Ira takes out the long list of jokes he's written.

<b>          IRA
</b>          But there's a lot more. The first
          three on this page. You didn't
          think they would work, but I think
          they will. You should just try
          them.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          They better kill, I'm getting paid
          a hundred thousand dollars for
          this.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Are you serious?
          ANGLE ON DAVE on stage.

<b>          DAVE
</b>          Ladies and gentleman, George
          Simmons.
          George does a few Apple jokes that do kill, and then he
          segues into his normal act. When he wants to be, he is a
          great performer.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          We'll be on the ground in a half
          hour. Want to go to a bar? Do
          something fun?

<b>          IRA
</b>          Sure. I like fun.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Here's a grand for the jokes and

          paying me after that.
          Ira's eyes widen.

<b>          GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>          Good job.

<b>          IRA
</b>          That's the most money I've ever
          made doing anything in comedy.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Then this is an exciting moment.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Well, I didn't make a hundred grand
          like you.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I feel nothing. I remember when a
          grand was the most exciting thing
          in the world. I'd go to Red
          Lobster and go nuts. Now it's just
          numbers in a bank account. Enjoy
          tonight. You made a thousand
          bucks.

<b>          MUSIC UP

</b>
          George and Ira enter. People are very excited to see George.
          They give him a nice table.
          -- George and Ira talk to two women, MANDY and DAWN. They
          both seem really into George. Ira feels kind of left out.

</b>          -- George focuses on Mandy, flirting and preparing her to go
          home with him.
          -- The other girl is now talking to a very uncomfortable Ira.
          She is not into it.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Hey, let's all go back to my house.

<b>          MANDY
</b>          Great!

</b>
<b>          (HOPEFUL)

          Music is playing. Everybody is drinking. Mandy is doing
          some weird sort of sexy dance for George.

<b>          MANDY
</b>          This house is so big. It's bigger
          than the college I went to.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Oh there's a whole other wing that
          you wouldn't even know existed
          unless you went through this door.

<b>          MANDY
</b>          I want to see, I want to see.
          George and Mandy disappear. Ira and Dawn are left alone.

<b>          IRA
</b>          You are very pretty.

<b>          DAWN
</b>          I have a boyfriend. Nothing is
          going to happen.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I didn't say anything was going to
          happen. I just said you were
          pretty. How do you even know I
          wanted something to happen?

<b>          DAWN
</b>          I hope she doesn't take a long

<b>          MANDY
</b>          I can't believe I'm having sex with

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          He can't believe he's having sex
          with you.

<b>          INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
</b>
          Ira and Dawn are watching one of George's films. Neither
          looks very happy or comfortable. George enters.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Hey, Mandy thought you left, so she
          left.

<b>          DAWN
</b>          Really?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Sorry, that kind of stuff happens
          when you have a big house.

<b>          DAWN
</b>          Oh, well then I guess I better get
          going?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          You don't have to go. I'm just
          saying that she left. I think she
          left her purse in the other wing.
          Come with me, let's go get it.
          Ira watches this, astonished.

<b>          GEORGE (CONT' D )
</b>          Did Ira tell you I have a room with
          all the classic pinball machines

</b>          That sounds awesome.

          gotta do what a man's gotta do."

<b>          GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>          (to Ira)
          Hey don't go, I'll be back in a
          second.

<b>          INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER
</b>
          Ira is now watching the end of the movie by himself. George
          sticks his head in.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          That girl left. You want to talk
          to me while I try to go to sleep.
          Ira doesn't know what to make of this.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I guess so.

<b>          INT. BEDROOM - LATER
</b>
          George is in bed under the covers, comfortably laying on his
          pillow. Ira sits in an easy chair located right next to the
          bed.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Did you have sex with both of those
          girls?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I'm afraid I did. I'm sorry. It
          was just so clear that you were not
          going to get it done. I figured
          you wouldn't mind.

<b>          IRA
</b>          That is crazy. That is super
          crazy.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          It was great. It was crazy great.

<b>          IRA
</b>          How can that even happen? I guess
          I understand the first one, but why
          would the second one do it? You
          probably stink of the first girl.

</b>          Well, we took a steam shower
          together.

<b>          IRA
</b>          What?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          she had never seen a steam shower
          before, I told her she should enjoy
          it.

<b>          IRA
</b>          She wouldn't fool around with me
          because she said she had a
          boyfriend.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          She told me that too, but she says
          I was on her and her boyfriend's
          list of people she was allowed to
          screw. You'd be surprised how many
          women have me on that list.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I should get going.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Just talk to me before I fall
          asleep. I'm weird. I don't like
          being alone. You should crash in
          one of the rooms. You're too drunk
          to drive home. I won't try to fuck
          you, I just fucked two women and
          I'm kind of done.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I may have to whack it in your
          guest room.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Whack away, I don't give a shit.

<b>          (BEAT)
</b>          Hey, you were funny tonight. I
          could see how you could get good.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Thanks. That was fun. It was rare
          that I get to play to more than
          twenty-five people. I've never

          like a lot.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I do feel bad for you, because no
          matter how hard you try, you'll
          never be as funny as me.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Why would you say that?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Did your dad crack you on the head

<b>          IRA
</b>          No.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          That's why. My dad always seemed
          annoyed with me. He'd always crack
          me on the head. You would not see
          it coming. I spent my whole
          childhood trying to make my dad
          laugh so he wouldn't smack me. But
          he was an awesome guy. He was the
          coolest. He just got annoyed with
          me. Do you like your parents?
          They can't be that bad, because
          you're not that funny.

<b>          IRA
</b>          They're bananas. And always broke.
          They got divorced ten years ago,
          but they both act like it just
          happened last week. They hate each
          other. They always put me in the
          middle of it. I always wanted them
          to say, "We don't want you to
          suffer through this, so we're just
          going to handle it ourselves."
          They never would do it. They would
          always make me feel their pain all
          the time. I would never do that
          for my kids. Because it's like
          they._`.re kids. And no matter how
          many times I tell them to leave me
          out of it, they never do.

</b>          Alright. So...
          (knows he's a sleeping
          pill at this point)
          I work at a supermarket at the deli
          counter. I hate it, but the
          money's actually pretty good.
          Better than you'd think. But I'd
          rather do comedy full-time if I
          could.
          The camera pulls back as Ira continues to talk, and we begin
          to HEAR George snoring, as Ira continues to talk anyway.

<b>          INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - MORNING
</b>
          George walks into the guest room, where Ira is sleeping.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Hey man, you want to make me
          breakfast?

<b>          IRA
</b>          okay.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Do you know how to cook anything?

<b>          IRA
</b>          Eggs.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Okay, let's have some eggs.
          While Ira is cooking, George takes a lot of pills.

<b>          IRA
</b>          What are you doing, man? Are those
          vitamins?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          No. Medicine. I'm sick.

<b>          IRA
</b>          What do you got?

<b>          28.
</b>
<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I've got some crazy blood disease.
          They think I'm going to die in six
          months to a year. Some weird
          thing, almost nobody has it. All
          these are experimental.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Are you fucking with me? That's
          not funny, man.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          No, I'm telling you the truth.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I never heard that before. That
          would be a big deal.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I haven't told anybody yet. I
          don't think I'm going to.

<b>          IRA
</b>          You're not going to tell anybody?
          You told me.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Well it's easier with you because I
          don't know you. I don't feel weird
          around you. I don't want to be
          treated like a guy who's going to
          die.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I don't know, man. I don't think
          you want to go through this alone.
          I think you've got to tell people.
          Your family. Your friends.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Actually, the reason why I only
          told you is I need you to do me a
          favor.

<b>          IRA
</b>          What? Anything, man.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I can't imagine suffering through
          the final stages of this. So...I
          was going to ask you if you would
          be willing...to euthanize me.

</b>
<b>          IRA
</b>          What does that mean?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Kill me. I figured if I found
          someone that nobody knew that was a
          stranger, they could get away with
          it, and I wouldn't have to suffer.
          I got a gun that is untraceable.
          And a silencer. And I thought
          maybe tonight, I would take a bunch
          of sleeping pills, and when I slept
          you would put a bullet in my head.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I can't do that!

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I'll give you fifty thousand
          dollars in cash. You'd be doing me
          a favor. It would be the kindest
          thing you could ever do for
          somebody.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Fifty thousand dollars? Can I at
          least take a little time to think
          about it?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Holy shit, you would do it. You
          were literally thinking about doing
          it!

<b>          IRA
</b>          You're an asshole.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I'm an asshole, you were about to
          kill me. For fifty grand! That's
          not even a lot of money.

<b>          IPA
</b>          I just got nervous so I was
          delaying saying no.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          You basically just told me that you
          were willing to be a murderer.
          While you're cooking me eggs.

<b>          IRA
</b>          That's not cool, man. You told me
          you're going to die and you want me
          to euthanize you. I almost had a
          heart attack.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Well, I actually am sick. And I'm
          not going to survive.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Don't do this. My friends do this
          all the time. They trick me, and
          then they trick me again. I'm very
          gullible. Don't do it.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I'm not putting you on, man. Just
          don't tell anyone. I mean that. I
          don't want people to know about
          this. I don't want to feel weird.
          Ira nods okay.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Are you religious? Does that give
          you any comfort?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Do you really think I'm going to
          sit here and have a theological
          conversation with you?

<b>          IRA
</b>          No.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Maybe later, Father Mulcahy.

<b>          INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER
</b>
          The three friends - Mark, Ira, Leo - smoke pot and have what
          they think is a deep conversation.

<b>          MARK
</b>          That's so sad.

<b>          LEO
</b>          If it was me, I would tell

<b>          IRA
</b>          He doesn't want to be that guy. He
          picked up two girls at a bar. Then
          he had sex with his. And then he
          came out and had sex with mine.

</b>          No, what I'm saying is...He's so
          lost right now that he's hiding
          from the world. And he's trying to
          distract himself by doing stand-up
          and having sex with a lot of women.
          And he doesn't want anyone to know
          but me.

<b>          MARK
</b>          Why you?

<b>          IRA
</b>          Because he doesn't know me. So he
          doesn't give a shit.

<b>          LEO

          song for fun. But they are very good. The music continues

<b>          EXT. IMPROV -- NIGHT

          George and Ira are waiting at the parking valet. The car
          pulls up. As they get in:

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I was thinking about it. I could
          throw you some money every week for
          coming up with new jokes for me.
          Maybe you can organize them in the
          computer, keep track of what I'm
          doing.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Absolutely. What do you want to

</b>          I'll throw you $1500 a week.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Okay, that could work.

</b>          I wasn't like you. I had a
          different theory. You've got to
          spend money to make money. Nothing
          makes you work harder than being in
          debt. Maybe we should go buy a
          Corvette. That'll make you try to
          be funnier.

</b>          You're supposed to give notice.
          That's what people do.

</b>          No, no. IÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ don't want to do that.

</b>          I feel like maybe you're holding
          everything in and I can understand
          why you don't want to deal with it
          because why would anyone want to
          deal with it. But I bet you have a
          lot of unfinished business with
          your friends. Wouldn't it make you
          feel a lot better to get your
          affairs in order? What do people

          there's a lot of business, estate
          issues, I don't know. Maybe you'll

          I had no one to call. My

</b>          Well maybe that's the problem.

          I thought she would just fall in
          love with you and get attached, and
          then what? I didn't want to do
          that to her.

          George and Ira talk in the kitchen while making beverages.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Thanks a lot, pal. This is
          everything I didn't want to happen.
          It's like being at my own funeral.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Afterwards you'll be happy you did
          it.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          No, I won't.

<b>          INT. LIVING ROOM
</b>
          George talks to a FRIEND who rambles on and on talking about
          his own problems, ignoring George's.

<b>          FRIEND
</b>          It is such a tucked up situation.
          Life is fucked. It makes no sense.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Well, I really appreciate you
          coming by.

<b>          FRIEND
</b>          This is why I can't be close with

          quiet...

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          It was so good to see you.
          George stands up and exits the room. Ira walks over.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I think George is going to take a
          nap now.

<b>          FRIEND
</b>          Oh, okay.

<b>          INT. LIVING ROOM
</b>
          A different FRIEND is talking about their own health issues.
          He goes on and on about his surgeries and treatments. George

          George is talking to BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN.

<b>          BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN
</b>          You're about to merge with the
          eternal. We're all going to die.
          No one gets out of here alive,
          right?
          George nods.

<b>           BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN (CONT'D)
</b>           You lived five lives, fucker.
          You're 200 years old in my book.
           The fun you've had, the money, the
          adventures, the women you've known.
          Who wouldn't want to change places
          with you right new?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>
<b>          (BEAT)
</b>          You need to shut the fuck up right
          now. Have you been browsing the
          self-help section at Barnes and
          Noble? Is this what you say in
          between songs these days? I'm
          going to go right now and delete
          all your songs off my iPod.

<b>          BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN
</b>          I'm sorry. I didn't know what to
          say. I just got nervous.

<b>          INT. GEORGE'S BEDROOM
</b>
          Ira is talking George to sleep. He's gotten good at it.
          Warren Zevon's "Don't Let Us Get Sick" plays in the
          background.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          This is awful. Awful. I hate you
          for having me do this.

<b>          IRA
</b>          You have to, you have no choice.
          You're doing good. And you're
          almost done, don't worry.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Well what are we going to do when
          it's over, when we're done
          tomorrow? Because then I'm not
          talking to anyone.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I was thinking we should go skiing
          somewhere. You're still physically
          doing well, and that's not going to
          last forever. You should do
          something active. Go to Colorado,
          or Tahoe, or something. Or do
          something crazy. Go to Switzerland,
          or Sweden, or wherever they have
          mountains.

</b>          I don't know, I don't even ski, but
          you do. Maybe you should do
          something like that.
          Ira notices George is falling asleep, so he talks more
          quietly. He's gotten good at this.

<b>          IRA (CONT'D)
</b>          If it's too hard, we can just ski
          for an hour or two a day, and then
          get drunk at the bar. You can hit
          on hot ski instructors, and then I
          can masturbate in the room thinking
          about you fucking hot ski
          instructors.
          He thinks George is asleep, so he walks out as he speaks.

<b>          IRA (CONT'D)
</b>          Whatever. It'll be fun to be in the
          mountain air, fun to look at the
          mountains. Maybe you shouldn't even
          be here. We can hang out there as
          long as you want, I got nothing to

          George is talking to LAURA, a very pretty woman in her late
          thirties. Laura is showing George a photo of her two
          daughters.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Thanks for coming down. You didn't

</b>          Don't do this.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          We could've had a family . I don't

<b>          LAURA
</b>          (tearing up)
          I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for
          what's happening to you.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          You know, maybe I deserve it. I
          screwed up the only good thing that
          ever happened in my life. I
          cheated on you. For no reason at
          all. Just young and stupid. And
          selfish. I'm sorry.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Maybe I over reacted. I didn't
          have to leave you.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Yes you did.
          ANGLE ON: Ira sneaking a peak from the kitchen as he makes
          coffee.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          And the funny thing is...my
          husband, he is on the road a lot
          for business. He did the same
          thing last year.

<b>          GEORGE

</b>          Me too.
          They cry, forehead to forehead.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          There's never been anything like

          Ira comes home, deep in the evening. He's eating some food.
          Daisy walks out of Mark's bedroom, dressed in Mark's long-
          sleeve t-shirt. She's clearly just had sex.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Hey. How's it going?

<b>          DAISY
</b>          Good.

          George and Ira are skiing. There is no music, no noise. It
          is very peaceful. George stops in a spot where he is
          surrounded in all directions by gorgeous, majestic mountains.
          He looks around, taking it all in.

<b>          INT. SKI LODGE HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          up when he was much younger. He's really, really funny. And
          very skinny, with a much more pronounced New York accent.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          You know, I never got married. I

          friends, like a Lou Reed/Velvet Underground (or Ramones/New

          George walks around his grounds, slowly. And one gets the

          before. He likes it.

<b>          INT. IMPROV - NIGHT
</b>
          George performs at the Improv. We see him gesture to a woman
          that she can come up on stage and she hugs him. The crowd

          his act.

<b>          EXT. SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS - DAY
</b>
          George and Ira hike up a hill.

</b>          I never understood why people hiked

          George and Ira have an uncomfortable dinner with George's
          angry sister, Lisa.

<b>          INT. BEDROOM -- NIGHT

          George is in bed, sleeping. Ira starts sneaking out. George
          wakes up, calls Ira back to keep talking to him.

          George is walking around his yard at night. He's clearly
          never walked the grounds at night. He seems at peace.

<b>          INT. GEORGE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
          Lisa and her husband are now over, and George is talking to
          them and playing with her two-year-old boy.

<b>          EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE
</b>
          George is sitting with his parents. It is clear he recently
          told them about his situation, and although there is sadness
          in the air, they look happy to be close for the first time in
          a long time.
          George says something that makes his DAD laugh.

<b>          INT. GEORGE'S LIVING ROOM
</b>
          Ira is asleep on the couch. George walks over with a bowl of
          ice cream. He whacks Ira a few times trying to wake him up,
          but Ira keeps snoring. George sits down next to the sleeping
          Ira and watches TV while eating his ice cream.

           George and Ira play basketball. Ira is awful.

          Ira is making breakfast. George is all dressed for the day.

</b>          What are you doing?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I'm feeling good, so I'm going to

          I wanna use this good place I'm in
          right now to do something really
          creative. I would pay you,

          a million dollars to write a

</b>          (what?)
          Yeah, we'll figure it out.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I thought a lot about my work when
          I was sick and I'm in sort of a
          strange place career-wise, because
          I'm normally the goofy, funny guy
          and I don't know if people are
          expecting a change from me. And I
          think people are expecting me to
          evolve, and it's important to
          evolve before they make a point of
          asking me why I'm not evolving.

<b>          IRA
</b>          It's always good to keep breaking
          new ground.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Is that something they taught you
          at the deli. I'm not asking you
          for your advice, I just though we
          could start trying to come up with
          an idea.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Well, I'm gonna start thinking.
          And...I'm really happy for you.
          Are you freaking out right now?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          It's very strange. It's gonna take
          me a few days to process it, but
          it's a gift and I'm going to treat
          it that way.

</b>          And he thanked me for helping him,

          during this time. I'm not saying
          that's why he got better, but he
          definitely had good energy and I
          hear that helps your immune system.

<b>          MOM
</b>          He's going to pay you two hundred
          thousand dollars to write a movie

</b>          I don't know, he said one or two
          hundred thousand.

<b>          BOB
</b>          One or two hundred thousand?
          That's pretty vague. That's a wide
          range. I'd push him toward two
          hundred thousand if I were you.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Thank you for the advice, Bob.
          That's very helpful.

<b>          MOM
</b>          This is good because now you can
          help with your sister's college

          financial stability for myself.
          The first time I make any real

</b>          Well that's very selfish.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Well you guys went on a cruise to

          shouldn't have gone, and saved for
          her college education.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I had to drop out of college after
          two years because you couldn't pay
          for it. Now I have to pay for
          hers? Let her figure it out. Let
          her get a job.

<b>          BOB
</b>          I didn't realize I raised such a
          selfish boy. When I was young I
          would have done anything for my
          family.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Then sell your house. Move into a
          smaller house. Use the extra money
          to pay for her college. Or tell
          her to work for a year or two, make
          some money, then she can pay for
          her own college. No one helped me
          out, I'm just digging out from
          under now.

          I'm very glad to be here. I'm not
          that glad to be here with you, but
          I thank you for having me. I'm
          sure it will be very memorable for
          you. Now let's find out what Leo's
          balls taste like.

          Everyone's sitting down watching the football game. George
          motions to Ira, and then looks at Daisy as if to say, "Is
          that the girl you used to like?"

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          (points at Ira)
          This guy wrote me some funny jokes
          for that Mac gig. I asked for some
          jokes and he sent me about a
          hundred. Seriously.
          (points at Leo)
          This guy sent me jack shit. If you
          want to succeed you need a work
          ethic like Ira over here.

<b>          LEO
</b>          Why wouldn't I have sent you jokes?
          You didn't ask me for jokes.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Sure I did. I asked you and Ira to
          write me jokes and you flaked.
          Leo's eyes widen with anger.

<b>          GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>          (to Daisy)
          Ira wrote this joke about Leopard,
          it was really funny. Do the joke,
          Ira.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I don't want to right now.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          It was like, what's great about.
          Leopard is you can watch a porno,
          write a porno, shoot a porno, and
          order a porno all at the same time.
          This guy's fucking funny.
          Leo jumps up suddenly and walks out of the room without
          saying anything. Ira watches him go, concerned.

<b>          GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>          (to Daisy and Ira)
          You guys look like a cute couple,
          you should go out.

<b>          DAISY
</b>          well, the truth is we had a date,
          but I went out with Mark first and
          he broke it off.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I didn't expect you to blurt it out
          like that. That was very honest of
          you.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          If I didn't go out with every girl
          one of my friends slept with... let
          me put it another way. If none of
          my friends went out with girls I
          went out with, none of them would
          have gotten laid.

<b>          (THEN)
</b>          So, are you guys dating now?

<b>          DAISY
</b>          No.

<b>          IRA
</b>          This is making me uncomfortable.
          The whole thing, it makes me
          uncomfortable.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          You guys are young, why are you
          taking everything so seriously? As
          someone who's been through a lot
          recently, let me tell you
          something. The worst thing you can
          do is hold grudges and be
          judgmental. Everyone's making
          mistakes, everyone's screwing up.
          You guys are cute together.
          George points at Mark.

<b>          GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>          I know that Mark's not good in bed.
          Don't tell me he was a good lay.
          He can't have a big dick. Look at
          Ira. He's thick. He's gotta have
          a thick dick.

<b>          DAISY
</b>          Actually, I have a really skinny
          vagina, so I'm not really into
          thick.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          See? She's funny. She can take a
          joke, she's not sensitive. I think
          I'm falling in love with both of
          you.

<b>          GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>          I'm gonna walk away now, causing an
          awkward moment, that will be
          followed by a true moment, filled
          with chemistry. I'm walking away
          now. Let the awkwardness begin.
          George walks out of the room.

<b>          DAISY
</b>          My brother's going to freak out
          that I met Davey.
          (to Ira)
          Did you go to the Wilco show?

<b>          IRA
</b>          I actually scalped them and made a
          hundred bucks.

<b>          DAISY
</b>          Well at last you didn't lose any
          money on the deal.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I'm sorry I got so upset with you,
          because it shows you how much I
          like you, which is weird because
          we've hardly spoken. I understand
          all of that.

<b>          DAISY
</b>          Well, attraction is all about
          smells, pheromones.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Well, you smell right to me.
          Daisy smiles at Ira, just as Leo stomps back into the room.
          He charges right up to Ira, pissed off.

<b>          LEO
</b>          You're a fucking prick, You're a
          piece of shit thief motherfucker.
          You stole a job from me, you stole
          my joke.

<b>          DAISY
</b>          You stole his joke?

          Leo pulls Ira into the other room and goes off on him.

<b>          LEO
</b>          He asked for me to write jokes too
          and you didn't tell me!

<b>          IRA

<b>          LEO
</b>          You .fucker!

<b>          IRA
</b>          I didn't think you would want to.

<b>          LEO
</b>          Why wouldn't I want to? What, I
          don't like money? I don't like
          private jets?

<b>          IRA
</b>          I'm sorry, it's just, I needed the
          gig. And you are doing so much
          better than me. I guess I just
          wanted this for myself.

<b>          LEO
</b>          It wasn't yours to keep for
          yourself. You lied to me.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I did. And it was fucked up. And
          I am sorry. I don't know what to
          say.

<b>          LEO
</b>          Don't say anything. Just get your
          shit, and get out of the apartment.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Are you serious?

<b>          LEO
</b>          You don't get let off the hook for

          That is a terrible strategy.

          Ira is mad at George for bringing up the jokes.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          He kicked you out for that.

          George is under the covers. He turns on the TV and he
          changes channels until he finds "Charlie Rose." They're
          interviewing a reporter from the New York Times about
          America's policy towards Pakistan.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I was thinking that now might be a
          good time for me to make that
          script "Making Amends."

<b>          TERRY
</b>          Do you really think people want to
          see you make a movie about a guy
          who goes to AA but isn't really an
          alcoholic? He just needs the
          companionship? That's a pretty big
          left turn.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          You know, I read it four years ago.
          I need to read it again. I don't
          remember not liking it. I just
          can't tell you the studio will make
          it. Your last few movies didn't do
          so well.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I thought they did well overseas.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          You always do well in Australia,
          but that's about it.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          What if I do it for no money, just

<b>          TERRY
</b>          I don't know if that's going to cut
          it either. The head of the studio
          does a lot of drinking, I don't
          think he finds that whole area
          funny. Maybe if you commit to do
          another one of the Davey movies, I
          could tie it to that, so they have
          to do both.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I'vedone four Davey movies.They

<b>          TERRY
</b>          Wellthere's this great script
          goingaround town, Happy Holidays.
          Whichis about an immature 40 year
          old man who acts like a kid. In it
          he comes home for the holiday
          season for the first time in ten
          years. And havoc ensues. You get
          to make fun of Thanksgiving, and
          Hanukkah and Christmas and New
          Years. They say they can turn it
          into a Davey movie.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Could I at least shoot the Making

<b>          TERRY
</b>          I wish you would. You've never

          You always talk a big game about

          George and Ira are sitting at a large kitchen table. There
          is a computer on the table and index cards. On the floor is
          a corkboard.

<b>          IRA
</b>          See, the thing I was thinking,
          was...you always play an immature
          guy. What if the joke of the movie
          is you're incredibly smart,
          intellectual and well-mannered.
          You just go the opposite way with
          it.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          There's nothing funny about being
          smart. All comedy comes from
          immaturity. Buster Keaton, Jerry
          Lewis, the Marx Brothers, WC
          Fields, Bill Murray, Steve Martin,
          Charlie Chaplin. They were all
          immature. They were all
          knuckleheads. Who wants to see a
          smart guy live his life normally?
          What's funny about that? What else
          you got?

<b>          IRA
</b>          I. .I gotta go through my notes.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I'm thinking about taking a gig,
          and having a solid hit before
          getting into breaking new ground.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Well we'll still write the script,

<b>          IRA
</b>          Let's just keep banging at it.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I can't. I've got a date.

<b>          IRA
</b>          You have a date? Who do you have a
          date with?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          This woman my agent set me up with.
          She raises money for this
          environmental group. I guess she's
          like a normal person. I can't live
          here alone in this house forever.
          I need something of significance in
          my life. So I'm gonna go out on
          some dates. No pressure.

<b>          IRA
</b>          You know what you should do, just
          as an experiment? You should try
          and not fuck her?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Why would you say that?

<b>          IRA
</b>          Because you're always saying you
          don't know if women like you for
          who you are. You don't know if
          they like you because you have
          money or you're famous. Why not
          take some time and get to know them
          before ass-raping them. In a
          romantic way.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          That's insulting. Don't take out
          your frustrations on me because you
          can't get laid by acting like I'm
          some sort of deviant. I'm an
          adult. I have adult sexual
          relationships. No one does what
          they don't want to do. Sex is how
          people decide if they like each
          other. I'm testing my
          compatibility by ass-raping them.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          That's not true. I'm bored of sex,

</b>          You know, I haven't been out on a
          blind date, ever. This may be the
          first one.

<b>          RACHEL
</b>          Oh I go out on them all the time.
          I've been on a bunch of J Dates.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          What's J Date?

<b>          RACHEL
</b>          It's a website where Jewish people
          find each other.

<b>          
</b>
<b>

<b>

<b>          78.
</b>
<b>          GEORGE
</b>          So it's just a list of all the
          Jewish people? I thought we didn't
          liked to be tracked and monitored
          like that.
          She looks at him, doesn't get the joke.

<b>          GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>          You know, because of
          the... holocaust.

<b>          RACHEL
</b>          (not understanding)
          It's just a great way for like-
          minded people to meet.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          What if you don't like Jews?
          She just stares at him.

<b>          GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>          I'm joking.
          (a beat)
          So, uh, I hear you raise uh money
          for an environmental group. That
          must be very satisfying.

<b>          RACHEL
</b>          It is, because, fixing the
          environment is really about having
          enough of a war chest to sue local
          government and corporations so
          they're forced to observe the
          environmental statutes that are
          already on the books. We also try
          to put pressure on the government
          to put pressure on other countries
          to clean up their environmental
          act. You know, one dilapidated
          factory in China can produce more
          pollution than every car in America
          puts out in one year.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          See? That's why I still drive a
          big truck. I stop driving that
          truck and that factory shuts down.

<b>

</b>
<b>          RACHEL
</b>          (not smiling)
          I know you're joking, but it's a
          very serious situation. People
          like you do a lot of damage to the
          environment. Whether it's taking a
          private jet by yourself, or getting
          driven around town limos around
          town or living in your gas-guzzling
          houses. Your carbon footprint is
          huge.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          You know what they say about people
          with a big carbon footprint? Big
          dick.

<b>          INT. IRA'S BEDROOM - MORNING
</b>
          George comes in and wakes Ira up.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Come on. We're gonna go do a gig
          tonight. Up north. And you're
          gonna open up for me.

<b>          IRA
</b>          How big a theater?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I think two thousand.

<b>          IRA
</b>          You should have told me so I could
          have prepared. I've never played a
          place that big. How long do you
          want me to do?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Twenty minutes. Thirty, if you can
          get there.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Shit.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Dress nice. Tickets are expensive.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I don't own anything nice.

<b>          INT. CAR - DAY
</b>

<b>           THE
</b>           Ira is driving George's Mercedes. George sits in
           player.
          backseat watching "Cloverfield" on a built-in DVD
          We see images of different parts of California.

<b>          IRA
</b>          How fucking up north is this?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Its near San Francisco.

<b>          IRA
</b>          So we have like five more hours to
          drive?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          It's not that far. It's like two
          more movies.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I don't like how you made me your
          limo driver. It's weird you're in
          the back and I'm up here.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I'd sit up front but the DVD player
          is back here.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I can't even listen to the radio
          because you're watching the movie.
          Can I sit back there and you drive?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          No. I'm near-sighted. I'll miss
          the exit.
          We Lear an EXPLOSION from the movie.

<b>          GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>          Holy shit!

<b>          IRA
</b>          What happened?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          The monster showed himself.

</b>          Great.

<b>          EXT. THEATER - DUSK
</b>
          The car pulls up to the theater.

<b>          INT. THEATER - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
          One of the MANAGERS walks George and Ira through the back of
          the theater toward the dressing room. They walk across the
          stage and we see the empty 2,000 seat theater. Ira is freaked
          out.

<b>          INT. DRESSING ROOM
</b>
          George and Ira are sitting in the dressing room, nibbling
          from the fruit tray. There's a knock at the door. A
          Security Person escorts Laura into the dressing room. Ira is
          thrown.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Hey, you made it.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          I wouldn't have missed it for the
          world, thanks for inviting me.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          You remember Ira.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Hi Ira. Are you performing
          tonight?

<b>          IRA
</b>          I'm afraid so. I've been told if
          I'm good it warms the crowd, and if
          I'm bad it makes them want George
          more, so...

<b>          LAURA
</b>          You look great. How are you
          feeling?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I'm hanging in there.

<b>          
</b>
<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          82.
</b>
<b>          LAURA
</b>          I thought a lot about you after I
          left.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Me too.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Well the show is going to start in
          a minute, I better get to my seat.
          I just wanted to say hi. Don't be
          too dirty tonight, you know that
          makes me uncomfortable.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Now I have no jokes. Ira, you have
          to do an hour and half.
          She laughs.

<b>          GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>          Come by after and give me the
          review.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Okay. Break a leg.
          She exits.

<b>          IRA
</b>          You didn't tell her that you're not
          sick anymore? Why wouldn't you
          tell her?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I need you to do something for me.
          After your set I gave you a seat
          right next to her. During the
          intermission I want yQ.u to tell her
          I'm not sick anymore.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Me? Why do you want me to tell
          her?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Because it's weird, and emotional.
          I think she'll handle it better if
          it comes from somebody else. And
          then I can talk to her about it
          afterwards.

<b>

</b>
<b>          IRA
</b>          That's weird.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          She'll be happy. It's not weird.
          You're the bearer of good news.

<b>          IRA
</b>          You had to do this to me right
          before my set. Like I'm not
          nervous enough.

<b>          CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          INT. THEATER
</b>
          Ira is performing on stage, doing his set. He's doing really
          well. This theater crowd is very enthusiastic about being
          there and gives him the benefit of the doubt on most of his
          jokes. As he continues his set, he gets more confident and,
          for the first time in the film, we think he has the potential
          to be a strong comic.

<b>          INT. THEATER - INTERMISSION
</b>
           Laura is sitting in her seat by herself. Ira makes his way
          across the aisle and sits down next to her.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Ira. Oh my gosh. You were so
          good.

<b>          IRA
</b>          You seem surprised.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          I don't know, you seemed so
          nervous. But you were really solid
          all the way though, and your ending
          hunk really murdered.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Thank you. Hopefully George won't
          be mad if I tired the audience out.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          I don't think he has anything to
          worry about. They always go crazy
          for him. Before he got famous, he
          used to bomb all the time.

<b>          LAURA (CONT'D)
</b>          And that's when I think he was the
          funniest. And now that everyone
          knows him, it's a little too easy
          for him, I think. No one was
          funnier when the audience hated him
          than George. He loved it.

<b>          IRA
</b>          So you guys were dating right when
          he started doing well?

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Yeah. But you always knew he was
          gonna do well. He had so much
          charisma. He would walk into a
          room and in ten minutes that whole
          room would be about him. Even
          before anyone knew who he was.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Where did you meet him?

<b>          LAURA
</b>          I was the hat-check girl at the
          Improv. And I was acting. I used
          to do guest spots on all those
          shows, like Melrose Place, Beverly
          Hills 90210. I always played the
          bitch. I don't know why, but I was
          on the top of the bitch list.

<b>          IRA
</b>          You don't seem like a bitch.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          That's because I was acting.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Sounds like fun days.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          It was, for awhile.
          Reveal George in the wings trying to get a look at them from
          a distance.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I don't know if you've heard, but
          it looks like George's medicine is
          working.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          What do you mean?

<b>          
</b>
<b>

<b>          IPA
</b>          When George got sick they didn't
          think they had any medicine that
          would help, so they put him on
          experimental medicine. And the
          last time he went to the doctor
          they couldn't detect his blood
          disease. They think it might be
          gone.
          A moment as Laura takes this in.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Why didn't George tell me?

<b>          IRA
</b>          He just found out. He doesn't want
          to jinx it. He doesn't want people
          to get excited, and then have it
          come back again.
          The lights go down.

<b>          ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
</b>          Ladies and Gentlemen. Here's the

          The place EXPLODES.

<b>          IRA
</b>
<b>          (JOKING)
</b>          I thought everyone came to see me.
          George begins his act. He could not kill harder. Or look
          more healthy and charismatic. We can tell it is all a show
          for Laura. Laura is completely thrown by this turn of
          events.
          The content of George's act is meant to portray him in a more
          positive, sympathetic light to Laura. He talks about being
          sick and the lessons he learned in a very dark, hilarious,
          and also uplifting way. All of it is intended to make him
          look like he has grown up and become wiser, and someone you
          could trust and spend your life with.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          I really don't know what to say.
          It's not like you weren't good
          before, but your act is so much
          more sophisticated, but just as
          funny. I've never seen you speak
          so honestly on stage before. You
          used to say these goofy jokes. It
          was really something, you know, and
          you should be really proud of
          yourself.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Thanks. A lot has happened. And
          at least I got some good jokes out
          of it.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Well, thanks for inviting me. I'm
          really glad I came.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Ira and I are driving out of town
          tomorrow, I thought maybe we could
          stop by your place on our way out.
          I want to see what the ranch looks
          like, and meet your husband.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          My husband is actually in China for
          another week, or so. He spends a
          lot of time there helping American
          businesses break into that market.
          So you won't meet him this time,
          but it would be great if you came
          by. That would be fun. I'll give
          you the tour.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Okay. We'll come by in the
          morning.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Okay.
          An awkward beat. Laura gives Ira a hug goodbye, then hugs
          George goodbye, trying to make it appear as if they have
          equal weight.

<b>          LAURA (CONT'D)
</b>          Bye. I'll see you then.
          She looks at Ira. As she exits--

          George opens up his wallet, gives Ira a thousand dollars.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Here's your money for tonight.
          Good job.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I'm excited to see her ranch. I
          hear it's delightful.

<b>          INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          Ira and George are in a room that has two queen-sized beds.
          They each lay on their bed in the dark.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Why couldn't we have gotten two
          different rooms?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          What's the fun in that? You can go
          pay for your own room, I don't
          care.

<b>          IRA
</b>          So, what happened with you and
          Laura? You seem to get along so
          well. Why did you cheat on her?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I was young, stupid... and I liked
          fucking girls. Why do you think I
          cheated? You would do it too if
          anyone would fuck you.

<b>          IRA
</b>          How many times did you cheat on

          Jewish. She was taking classes to
          convert, even. I mean, how cool is
          that? She was changing religions
          to be with me. She knew more about
          being a Jew than I did from those
          classes. She was so cute when she
          spoke Hebrew, it sounded so wrong.
          George says the Jewish grand prayer with a waspy accent.

<b>          GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>          And then one day, somebody told
          her, I don't know who. And that was
          that.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Why do you want to go see her
          tomorrow? We could do something
          productive like get some writing
          done.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I like her. I love her. I miss
          her. I just want to spend a little
          time with her. I know nothing will
          come of it. I just miss being
          around her.
          A beat. George starts clicking through Video On--Demand adult
          movies.

<b>          GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>          Anything looking good to you?

<b>          IRA
</b>          I don't want to watch adult movies
          with you.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          okay. You want to watch Juno?

</b>
          George and Ira drive up to the house. It's a large one-story
          house that is part of a ranch with a lot of land and a horse
          stable.
          They walk to the front door, ring the doorbell. George seems;
          a little nervous.

<b>          IRA
</b>          You okay, buddy?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Yeah, of course I am.
          Laura opens the door.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Hi? We've been waiting for you.
          Come on in.

<b>          INT. LAURA'S RANCH - CONTINUOUS
</b>

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          This place is beautiful.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Thanks. We've been here for five
          years. I think I just finished
          decorating it.
          She leads them through the living room into a huge open
          kitchen. On the island, there is freshly squeezed lemonade,
          chips and dip. She has over-prepared for their arrival.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Can I live here?

<b>          LAURA
</b>          of course, you can clean the
          stables.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          You have horses?

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Yes. Clarke, my husband, was a
          real city boy. But for some reason
          he loves horses. Of course I'm
          lef t to take care of them. But
          yes, we have three horses.

<b>          IRA
</b>          That's crazy, owning a horse. I
          can't even keep a goldfish alive.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          All right, well, we're ready for
          the big tour. I want to see how
          you live.
          Suddenly, Laura's five-year-old daughter INGRID runs into the
          room and she's pissed.

<b>          INGRID
</b>          Mom! You said you were coming
          back! We're playing American Idol,
          you're ruining the game!
          Ira is shocked to see that Laura has a child. This
          complicates a situation he already thought was getting too
          complicated.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          I'll come right up. This is my
          friend, George. And Ira.

<b>          INGRID
</b>          It's my turn to sing and you're
          supposed to be the judge and you're
          not in there and I'm very angry!

<b>          IRA
</b>          How old are you?

<b>          INGRID
</b>          Five. But I turn six very soon.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Really? Because I thought you were
          like nine, about to turn ten.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          She's very pretty.
          (to Ingrid)
          I like your hair.

<b>

<b>          INGRID
</b>          I'm so sick of people telling me
          they like my hair.
          George is clearly not that good with kids.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Okay. I do not like your hair.

<b>          INGRID
</b>          Don't make fun of me.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          He's just joking Ingrid.

<b>          IRA
</b>          My hair. I have curly hair too.
          Curly hair is the best.

<b>          INGRID
</b>          Last week my mom straightened it
          and it almost went to the floor.

<b>          IRA
</b>          If you straighten my hair, I look
          crazy. I look like the killer from
          No Country for Old Men. Have you
          seen that movie?
          MABLE, Laura's ten-year-old daughter storms into the room.

<b>          MABLE
</b>          You guys left me all alone in the
          playroom! If you're gonna leave
          I'm just gonna go talk on the
          webcam with Caroline.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Don't be rude. This is Ira and
          George.

<b>          MABLE
</b>          Oh, I know you. My mom watches
          your movies all the time. But most
          of them I'm not allowed to see.
          George smiles at Ira--Laura's a little busted.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Oh, really? Do you like them?
          Which one's your favorite?

<b>          MABLE
</b>          I don't know. I don't really like
          the ones I'm allowed to see, but I
          think I would like the ones I'm not
          allowed to see. But she says I
          cant' see them till I'm sixteen.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Sixteen? Just fast-forward past
          the bad parts.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          The whole thing is a bad part.
          George LAUGHS in a slightly flirty fashion with Laura. Ira is
          getting uncomfortable with the subtext.

<b>          LAURA (CONT' D )
</b>          C'mon, let's finish the game.

<b>          INT. PLAYROOM
</b>
          George, Ira, Laura, and Mable are sitting on the floor.
          Ingrid stands on a make-shift stage singing a Miley Cyrus
          song while wearing a feather boa and sunglasses and a red
          wig.

<b>          INGRID

          you rock out the show!
          Everyone applauds for her.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Okay. Now it's time to see what
          the judges say. I thought you had
          a lot of energy, you're clearly
          gonna make it to the final four,
          and I love your outfit. What do
          you think, Randy?

<b>          IRA
</b>          Yo, dawg. That was the bomb. It
          was a little pitchy in places, but
          I dug it. I really dug it.

<b>          MABLE
</b>          .I'm Simon, and I thought it was
          horrible. I don't how you made it
          this far in the competition.

          Simon, what did you think?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I can't believe I'm saying this,
          but I agree with Paula. I think
          you're the one to beat.
          They all applaud. Ira notices Laura looking at George with
          admiring eyes that reek of more than friendship.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Okay Mable, you're up.
          Mable instantly starts gyrating in a manner that is not
          appropriate for a ten-year-old and singing the Fergie song
          "London Bridge."

<b>          MABLE

</b>          I want to go down like London,

          Laura sits on a ATV. George sits behind her. Ira is on
          another ATV with Ingrid sitting in front of him, as he
          steers. Mable rides a very small dirt bike.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          All right! Here we go.
          They start driving down a path that goes around the edge of
          the ranch. George has his hands around Laura's waist as they
          drive. Ira looks over, concerned.

          Laura slows down and allows Ira, Mable and Ingrid to get
          ahead and turn a corner. Then she stops the ATV and turns
          around and kisses George.
          George looks surprised, but happy. Laura just stares at him,
          trying to decide what she makes of him now. Then we hear

          The kids are playing in the background as George, Laura and

<b>          IRA
</b>          But it's like a seven, eight hour
          drive home. If we stay for dinner,
          we're not going to get home till

          George stares at Ira for a beat, then --

</b>          Don't worry, we'll figure it out.
          You have something to do in the

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          This town is so small and adorable.
          It's like out of a Demi Moore
          movie.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Clarke's company is about forty-
          five minutes from here. This town
          seemed so perfect when we were
          looking for a house. There's no
          traffic, there's one coffee house,
          one bookstore, one market. No
          crime. But after you've lived her
          a few years you hunger for another
          coffee shop, a bigger bookstore,
          and a little crime. It gets so
          boring. And it's such a small
          town, God forbid you miss one of
          you kid's soccer games, they put
          the scarlet letter on you.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          it can't be that bad. You live on
          a pretty little ranch. You have
          horses, a duck. It must be a nice
          life.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          We used to have so much fun. I
          don't think I have that much fun
          anymore. I don't like who I'm
          turning into. Is the fun over? I
          have to get up every morning at
          six, drive my kids to school and
          then I have 6 hours before I have
          to pick them up. I have to yell at
          them to do their homework, be a
          taskmaster, then I make them
          dinner.

           put them to bed. And then it's
          8:30 and I pass out. And it's
           great, but tuck. And when both
           kids are done with high school I'll
          be 49 years old, and then I'll have
           probably 6 very healthy years, then
          I'll kind of slow down and then

          hit Ingrid in school, and his mom
          acted like she didn't care at all,
          so I told her to fuck off.

          he did it once but I know because I
          learned from you, they do it once,
          they do it all the time. You
          either cheat or you don't.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          well I don't anymore. I haven't
          cheated on anybody since you. I
          haven't even been in a committed
          relationship since you, so it's
          impossible for me to have cheated.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          That's both flattering and deeply
          disturbing.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I thought a lot about you when I
          was sick, and I would do anything
          for another chance. I know it
          creates a mess, but I think it
          would be worth it. I think we both
          know it's what we should be doing.
          He kisses her.

           Ira, Mable and Ingrid are outside at a table building houses

</b>          If you had an Exacto knife we could

          George and Laura enter the guest house, which has been turned
          into her husband's office/playroom/sports-viewing room. On
          the wall are six enormous flatscreen TVs. The room is also
          filled with sports memorabilia in Lucite cases and expensive
          looking sports photography.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Does somebody in your family like

<b>          LAURA
</b>          I really never thought I was going

          Laura and George are walking into the house. They are not
          holding any bags. They walk into the living room where Ira
          is making a Spongebob SquarePants puzzle on the floor with
          Mable and Ingrid.

<b>          IRA
</b>          You're back. That was quick.

</b>          Where are the groceries?

<b>          LAURA
</b>          We decided ordering in might be a

<b>          INT. LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

          Everyone is sitting on the couch watching Ratatouille on the
          television. They see car lights in the driveway.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Food's here! All right, everybody.
          Let's sit down at the kitchen
          table.
          Everyone gets up and heads toward the kitchen. Laura opens
          the front door, George is a few steps behind her. A handsome
          man of forty appears. This is not the pizza guy. It's
          CLARKS, Laura's husband.

<b>          LAURA (CONT'D)
</b>          Clarke, oh my gosh. What are you
          doing home?

</b>          The man I was supposed to have a
          meeting with had a heart attack, if

          to try and sneak home for a few
          days before my next set of
          meetings.
          George appears behind Laura, not knowing what he's getting
          himself into.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          Hello.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Oh, Clarke. George had a
          performance last night in town,
          which I went to, and him and his
          opening act, Ira, came by to say
          hello on their way out of town.
          There is an awkward moment, then Clarke smiles and gives
          George a compassionate look, the type of look you give a man
          you think is dying.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          It is really nice to meet you,
          George. Laura talks about you all
          the time, and we're obviously big
          fans of your movies.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Well, thank you. You've got a

<b>          LAURA
</b>          I'm so glad you're home, honey.
          Laura gives Clarke a hug and a peck. Then Ira walks over.

<b>          IRA
</b>          What's taking so long with the
          pizza?
          Before anyone can say anything the PIZZA DELIVERY GUY appears
          in the doorway.

<b>          PIZZA DELIVERY GUY
</b>          Hi. That'll be twenty-eight forty-

<b>          IRA (CCNT'D)
</b>          It tastes just like New York pizza,
          which is so surprising because you
          can't get good pizza in Los
          Angeles, so you wouldn't think you
          could get it in Northern
          California. But this really tastes
          like New York pizza.
          A long pause.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Sounds like your business is going
          very well.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          People never thought China would do
          this much business with us, you
          know, but it didn't seem like a
          risky proposition for me. They've
          got a billion people, we make all
          kinds of cool shit in America,
          they start finding out about it on
          the internet and what-not. Sooner
          or later they're gonna find a way
          to get our shit.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          He speaks Chinese. For real.
          Ingrid yells at something in Chinese.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          You don't think they want new
          mobile phones? A new X-box? I'm
          trying to get access into North
          Korea, no shit. That situation
          could chance overnight. That is a
          huge market waiting to be tapped.
          It's already starting in Cuba.

<b>          IRA
</b>          My friend backpacked across China
          and he caught some sort of virus or
          something from what he ate. He was
          sickforweeks. He still has it.

          very strong.

</b>          It's a terrible situation. I'm so
          sorry.

</b>          I appreciate that.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          He's been fighting the good fight.
          His doctors are taking very good
          care of him.
          Ira can believe this conversation is happening.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          You're a tougher man than me. I
          don't know how I could go about my
          day with that hanging over my head.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          It just makes you appreciate every
          moment. It brings things into
          focus, you suddenly realize what's
          important in life.

<b>          LAURA

          should I bring out the desert?

<b>          IRA
</b>          I'd love desert. What do you have?
          Do you have any ice cream or cake,
          or anything like that? I have a
          real big sweet tooth right now.
          Why don't we go into the kitchen
          and do an ice cream bar with kids
          right now? I've got a better idea,
          I make a really good milkshake. We
          should all go make milkshakes with

          buy into that shit.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          Our country's only two hundred
          years old. The Chinese have been
          around for thousand of years
          figuring this shit out. How I got
          into it, I had acid ref lux and
          nothing was working and then this
          guy at work turned me onto a
          Chinese doctor and he gave me some
          herbs that tasted like dogshit, but
          they worked.

<b>          LAURA

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          You girls can go play in the other
          room. The Chinese have a completely
          different way of looking at health.
          They don't think doctors should
          attack the diseases in the body,
          they're all about trying to support
          the body and make it stronger, so
          the body can fight off the disease.
          It works. I've seen it. I wish I
          could find a way to mass-market
          Chinese medicine in this country.
          Someone's gonna do it and make a

</b>          Well, I also ran a theatre company.
          And it was down to me and Cameron

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          You can't leave now, you won't get
          back until daylight. You should
          crash in the guest house. I'm sure
          it not as fancy pants as where you

          removing her bathrobe in the process. Without ever speaking,
          she pulls the covers over both of them and begins to make
          love to him. George is surprised but not completely shocked
          and goes along happily with it.
          ANGLE ON: Ira, he never wakes up.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          You sure you can't stay?

<b>          IRA
</b>          We really do need to get back. I
          have to visit my mom. I can't miss
          it. It's her birthday. Everyone
          in my family is coming in from
          across the country for it. She's
          turning 65. It's very important we
          get back for it.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          That's too bad, I wish you could
          stay.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          (very serious)
          I wish I could say I was gonna see
          you again, but I can't say that.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Clarke, don't. You don't need to
          do that.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          You know what? I think I do need
          to do that. One thing I learned in
          China from some Buddhist friends of
          mine is it's important to have an
          open heart, to live in the moment,
          and to speak the truth to each
          other. So I'd like to say to you,
          George, that it was a great
          pleasure to meet someone who had
          such a big impact on my wife's
          life. I really like you. And wish
          we had more time to get to know
          each other. And I wish you a
          peaceful end to your journey. And
          another great journey on the other
          side of it.
          Clarke hugs George.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I really don't know what to say. I
          re- ally don't know what to say.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          That was beautiful, honey. Well
          let me walk them to the car.
          Ingrid walks over.

<b>          INGRID
</b>          Don't be sad. Ira told us that his
          medicine is working and he's not
          sick anymore.

<b>          MABLE
</b>          I think that was a secret. I don't
          think you were supposed to say
          that.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          Mable, take Ingrid into the house.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          I never said that he was still
          sick. He just took some medicine
          and it's looking better. You can't
          detect it in his blood, but it
          could come back.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          Is it looking better? Or is he
          better?

<b>          IRA
</b>          Well ...I don't how you define these
          things-I'm not... sure.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          is something going on here? Are
          you getting your revenge on me
          while I'm away? I came clean with
          you, you can't come clean with me.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          You know what? I don't know what I
          want now.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Oh shit.
          It's ON.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          So this is what you want? Was he
          ever sick in the first place?

<b>          IRA
</b>          He was sick. He was very sick.

<b>

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          Because if this is what you want,
          I'll leave right now. I'm not
          going to play these games. I'm
          happy to leave. I'm not gonnna
          have you put me on the cross
          because I made some mistakes. You
          guys enjoy each other. I could

          George lays on the bed. Ira is pacing around the room.

<b>          IRA
</b>          What the fuck is going on? Did you
          guys do something?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          We had sex in Clarke's office.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Why?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Because I love her. She's the best
          thing that's ever happened to me.

<b>          IRA
</b>          But she has two kids, she's
          married.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          She's miserable. He cheated on

</b>          Yeah, but that was a long time ago.
          I've changed. You saw that douche

          geishas on every business trip?

<b>          IRA
</b>          He was trying to cure you with

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          This is none of your fucking
          business. Just stay out of it.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I can't stay out of it. We took
          your car here. I have no way of
          leaving.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          This shit is deeper than you
          understand. People get divorced.
          People make mistakes and then they
          fix them. That's how life works.
          It's not a big deal. I know you're
          still sad because your parents got
          divorced. Well get the fuck over
          it. Call a fucking cab and go
          home.

</b>          So what are we gonna do?

          George walks into the room, discovers Laura on the computer,
          going through papers. She is smoking a joint.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          On, there you are. I've been
          looking for you.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          I've been going through all the

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Are you smoking a joint?

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Yeah. My best friend Nancy grows
          this stuff on a hill by her house.
          You want some?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          No, that stuff makes me paranoid.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Not me. It makes me feel sharper,
          Some people get tired, I get more
          energy, more clear.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          What's happening?

</b>          What's happening? Whatever we want

          They start kissing again. She starts to moan loudly.

          Hey, Daisy. It's Ira.

<b>          DAISY (V.0.)
</b>          Oh. Ira. What's going on?

<b>          IRA
</b>          I just wanted to talk to you

          My friends are all mad at me and
          George is kind of losing his mind.

<b>          DAISY (V.0.)
</b>          You can tell me, what is it?

<b>          IRA
</b>          Look, I know you think I have the
          moral code of some guy from the 50s
          like Dwight Eisenhower, but I'm
          with George and he's hitting on his
          ex-girlfriend who's married now and
          has kids and I don't know what to
          do. I'm kind of freaking out. I
          think I'm having a panic attack.

<b>          DAISY (V.0.)
</b>          Well don't have a panic attack,
          that's not going to help anything.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Well telling me to not have a panic
          attack is not going to stop it.

<b>          DAISY (V.0.)

<b>          DON'T HAVE A PANIC ATTACK!!!

          minute. Mable, go wipe your
          sister's butt.

<b>          MABLE
</b>          She can do it. She's almost six.
          That's weird.
          Ingrid and Mable walk off together.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I wet the bed til I was eleven. It
          wasn't even a mental thing. I just
          got relaxed when I was asleep.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          I spoke to Clarke. He's going to
          fly back to China tonight. I was
          thinking about driving to the
          airport and meeting him there and

          that?

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Yes. It's what I want. I just
          need to figure out when we would
          move down to LA. It might be
          better to let the kids finish out
          the school year because I have to
          apply to the private schools in LA,
          and I don't know if I missed the
          deadline. Then I'd have to look
          into the charter schools.
          Sometimes these private schools, if
          you give them a donation, they let
          your kids in. Maybe you can stay
          up here for part of the year if I
          can't make it happen.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Sure. If I'm not shooting a movie,
          or on tour or something, that would
          be great.
          Laura leans in and kisses George. George is not big on
          public displays of affection. He kisses back, but you can
          tell that he's very uncomfortable.
          They hear the kids headed back to the table and quickly
          separate.

<b>          MABLE
</b>          I made her wipe her own butt.

<b>          INGRID
</b>          I did it, but I don't know if I did
          a good job.
          (to George)
          Look at what I drew. I drew a
          picture of you. Look? Show Mama.
          George holds it up. It is a picture of several people.

<b>          INGRID (CONT'D)
</b>          That's you. That's George. That's
          Mommy. And Daddy. And me. And

          We see the picture, and it is everybody holding hands.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          This is a small bookstore. They've
          only got one Philip Roth book.
          Didn't he write like fifty books?

<b>          IRA
</b>          So when are we going to go home?
          You're not talking at all about
          when we're going to go home.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          She's going to talk to Clarke
          tonight, and then she's going to
          make a plan. We've got to get over
          that hurdle.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Are you okay with everything? This
          is happening pretty fast.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          This is exactly what I wanted.

</b>          Okay.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I mean, she's cool, right?

<b>          IRA
</b>          She's nice. I don't really know

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          She was kind of cooler when I knew
          her back in the day. She's still
          hot, but she was crazy hot back
          then. Her attitude has changed a
          bit. With the kids and all. Back
          then she was really sexy, and all
          about fucking. I know she's busy
          with her life now, but it is a
          little different.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Yeah, well when you have two kids
          and a husband, and horses and
          ducks, it's not all about fucking.

</b>          That's just the hormones of youth.
          I'm all about fucking. But I don't
          expect to be when I get older.
          I'll be occasionally about fucking,
          which is normal. The fact that
          you're all about fucking now is the
          weird thing.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Well hopefully everything will work
          out. If it doesn't, it just wasn't

</b>          What does that mean?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          It means I'm going to give it a
          shot. I'm excited, but I'm not
          going to really know if it works
          until we're in it. I hope I'm just
          not in love with the person she
          used to be.

<b>          IRA
</b>          She's about to leave her husband

</b>          There's no way to ever be sure that
          anything's going to work! I
          couldn't live up here. She wants
          me to live up here. I don't think
          I can do it. Maybe a couple of
          weeks a year.

          going to bring the kids too?

<b>          IRA
</b>          Of course. What else would she do?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I don't know, don't some men get
          custody of the kids? Or they split
          the custody? I like the kids, but

          Laura runs into the middle of the scene.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Laura, tell Clarke to stop!

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Clarke, please don't do this.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          Don't tell me what I can and can
          not do.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Laura, tell him. Tell him you want
          to be with me now.
          Laura doesn't answer.

<b>          GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>          Laura?

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Why did you have to come here and
          confuse me? Everything was fine
          before you came here. Now
          everything is all screwed up.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Laura, what's it going to be? Are
          you going with him, or are you
          going with me?
          Laura looks at Clarke.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Don't do this.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          You fucked up my life. And now I
          fucked up yours. But just a
          little. Probably just for a day.
          She walks back into the house.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          Hit the road before I put you
          through another round.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          You cheated on her too!

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          Yeah, but we're married. We're
          going to work through this shit.
          You should have waited until you
          were married to cheat. It buys
          you another chance.
          Clarke punches George. Ira is on the ground. He doesn't get
          up.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          She told me I was the love of her
          life. And she loves me more than
          she loves you!

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          When she said that, did she think
          you were dying?

</b>          Too bad you had to 'Live and find

          Clarke punches him. George gets a punch in but it doesn't
          hurt Clarke. Clarke punches him again.

<b>          CLARKE (CONT'D)

</b>          Clarke hits George again. Ira leaps on Clarke and now all
          three are on the ground rolling around, arms flailing.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          (to Ira)
          Stop Ira, you're hitting me too.
          Mable and Ingrid appear outside.

<b>          MABLE
</b>          What are you guys doing?

<b>          INGRID
</b>          What's happening?
          The three look at the kids and instantly feel awful.

<b>          IRA
</b>          We're just playing that's all.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          We're wrestling. It's fun.

<b>          CLARKS
</b>          Boys like to wrestle just like
          girls.
          They all start wrestling some more, but this time it is fake
          playful. They give each other noogies, and tickle each other
          so the kids won't be scared.
          A little blood runs off of George's face.

<b>          INGRID
</b>          Are you bleeding?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          No. We were just painting. I got
          some paint on my cheek.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          Come on girls. Let's go inside.
          Mable and Ingrid run inside. Clarke turns to George.

<b>          CLARKE (CONT'D)
</b>          You know what sucks about this? I
          like your movies and now I can't

          Clarke goes inside.

<b>          IRA
</b>          That was meaner than him punching
          you. That is a demented
          motherfucker.
          George punches Ira in the face. Ira fires back two punches
          at George's face and he stumbles back.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          None of you fuckers can hurt me.
          George pauses, then leaps onto Ira and they roll on the
          ground for a moment. Ira makes his-way free and gets up.

</b>          Get the hell off of me you psycho.

          You tried to screw me over, after

<b>          IRA
</b>          I am not responsible for you. You

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          It's not a job, you're a tacky.
          You're not even that fucking funny.
          This gets Ira very mad.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Who cares? If being funny means
          being like you, I rather be a
          little less funny.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Mission accomplished.

<b>          IRA
</b>          You're the only person I know who
          learned nothing from a near-death
          experience! You actually went
          backwards. All it did was it
          brought out what a prick you are,
          brought everything bad to the

</b>          Everything is about you. You don't

          Ira drives George home in the dark. Neither one speaks.
          We see images of different cities going by the window. Ira
          thinks about all he's been through and the challenges ahead,

          Ira pulls up to his apartment.

<b>          IRA
</b>          okay, I'm getting out. You have to
          drive yourself home. I'm getting
          out here.

</b>          There is no later! I'm not going

          don't want your car.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          So that's how it's going to be.

<b>          INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE
</b>
          George enters. There is an enormous pile of stuff to do on
          his dining room table. Several stacks of scripts. One pile
          has a big post-it note that says: "READ THESE!"

<b>          INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE
</b>
          George lies alone in bed, alone. Eyes wide open. It's
          really bright in his room.
          George hits a button. The shades automatically close. The
          room goes dark.
          Now he's in the dark with his eyes open. He turns on the TV
          to go to sleep. It's the Today show. It's really happy and
          morning-themed. The piece on the Today show is very suburban.
          "How to Clean Up Clutter."

          George reads one from a large pack of scripts. A few pages
          in, he clearly doesn't like it. He puts it down, picks up
          another one.
          The large stack is clearly the ones he doesn't like.

          George walks over with a young comedian of about Ira's age.
          This young man has clearly taken his place.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Hey, how's it going?

<b>          IRA
</b>          Hey George.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          This is Randy. He's funny, you'd
          like his stuff. It's smart.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I'm sure I would. I look forward
          to seeing it. Are you going on
          tonight?

<b>          RANDY
</b>          I hope so.

</b>          (to George)
          Do you want to go up? Ira was

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          No, that's ok. I don't want to

<b>          INT. IMPROVISATION - MOMENTS LATER

          Ira is introduced. He walks onto the stage. We see George
          walk to the very back corner of the club and sit down at a
          table by himself.
          On stage Ira does his act. He is much more comfortable than
          we have ever seen him on stage before. He is no longer
          searching for his comic identity. He has found a way to be
          himself on stage, and tells jokes which are more personal
          than we have seen before.
          Not everything kills, but when something eats it he does not
          seem thrown. Sometimes he seems amused.

          laugh, but then slowly starts laughing--but more at the
          things Ira does in between jokes. We can tell that he is
          proud of Ira and misses him.

<b>          INT. SUPERMARKET -- DAY

          Ira is back behind the counter, working at the Deli with
          Chuck and Gail. He doesn't look too unhappy to be there.

<b>          FEMALE CUSTOMER
</b>          Is the potato salad fresh?

</b>          Mrs. Gail, this fine woman would
          like a quarf'of potato salad.
          The woman moves to the other side of the counter. We reveal
          George standing there, holding his ticket.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Do you have any turkey that's
          hormone-free?

</b>          So this is where you work.

</b>          Or any kind of partner. You want

          each other.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          In my travels, I have learned a lot

<b>          IRA
</b>          That guy was a douche-bag.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          But also kind of cool. It's a very

</b>          He was going to heal you with those

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I think most of what you said to me

</b>          You were good the other night. I
          hear you're getting regular spots
          now.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I'm actually going up tonight.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Really? Any new jokes you're
          working on?

<b>          IRA
</b>          Yeah, I've been trying to get off
          my ass and do some writing.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          What do you got?
          Ira is surprised to hear him ask this, since he has never
          asked this before.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I was thinking about doing a bit
          about how I'm not very good
          looking, but I'm not bad looking,
          but I'm just good-looking enough
          that if I had a good personality,
          it might put me over the top.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          You should do something about how,
          when you date a girl, and you feel
          really good and she likes you, and
          then you see pictures of all her ex-
          boyfriends, and they're all really
          goofy-looking guys, and it's not
          that you're good looking, it's just
          that in this psychotic girl's eyes,
          you're good looking?

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          141,
</b>
<b>          IRA
</b>          And how all of her boyfriends look
          like Lou Costello.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Why don't you say Dom Deluise?
          it's a more current reference.

<b>          IRA
</b>          More current? What year was
          Cannonball Run, 1978?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Okay, okay. What else you got?

<b>          IRA
</b>          I was going to talk about how I
          haven't had sex in so long, that I
          can't even remember my previous
          sexual experiences so I can
          masturbate to them.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          You should say, now when I
          masturbate, I have to think about
          the last time I masturbated.

<b>          IRA
</b>          That's a good one. You can write.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          You know, I always wanted to be
          part of the comedy field.
          As the camera pulls back, George continues to pitch Ira jokes
          for his act, the first selfless act we've seen him commit in
          the entire film. As their friendship rekindles, we...
