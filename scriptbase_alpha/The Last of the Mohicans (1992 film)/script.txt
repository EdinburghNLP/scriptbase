     FADE IN

     The screen is a microcosm of leaf, crystal drops of precipitation, a stone, 
     emerald green moss. It's a landscape in miniature. We HEAR the forest. Some 
     distant birds. Their sound seems to reverberate as if in a cavern. A piece of 
     sunlight refracts within the drops of water, paints a patch of moss yellow. The 
     whisper of wind is joined by another sound that mixes with it. A distant 
     rustling. It gets closer and louder. It's shallow breathing. It gets ominous. 
     We're interlopers on the floor of the forest and something is coming. 

     SUDDENLY: A MOCCASINED FOOT
     
     rockets through the frame scaring us and ... 

     EXTREMELY CLOSE: PART OF AN INDIAN FACE
     running hard. His head shaved bald except for a scalp-lock. Tattoos. He's 
     twenty-five. He seems tall and muscled. Heavy, even breathing. We'll learn later 
     this man is UNCAS, the last of the Mohicans. 

     PROFILE: UNCAS' ARMS

     flash as he runs. One carries a flintlock musket. Sweat on the man's skin. A 
     calico shirt is gathered at the waist with a wampum belt of small white beads 
     over a breechcloth. He wears leggings to protect his legs. A long-handled 
     tomahawk is stuffed in his belt.

     in the hand of another running man. He's heavier, older ... 
     
     CHEST

     A green bear claw is tattooed there. Silver armband. A snake is tattooed over 
     his left eyebrow. Silver rings in his ear. He's forty to forty-five. His head is 
     shaved into a scalp-lock. It says: "Come and lift this from me. Take it, if you 
     can ..." That prospect strikes us as extremely unlikely. This man is 

     CHINGACHGOOK.

     The French call him "Le Gros Serpent," the Great Snake, because 
     "he knows the winding ways of men's nature and he can strike a sudden, deathly 
     blow." 

     WIDE ANGLE: CHINGACHGOOK

     runs, disturbing no leaves, no branches; making no sound. He's running parallel 
     to Uncas through the cathedral of mature forest. It's heavily canopied. There's 
     very little brush. The girth of the trees is huge. Shafts of light illuminate 
     motes of dust and turn leaves emerald where the sun breaks through. Sometimes 
     there's ferns; rhododendron, sometimes pale grass and outcroppings of rock. 
     These men run the forest streams, over boulders, fallen trees and down into 
     ravines as if they own them. They do.

     ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - LONG BLACK HAIR - DAY

     rocketing through trees. His torn buckskin shirt is tied at the waist with a 
     wampum belt holding a tomahawk and a large knife. A long rifle in which is 
     carved the name "Killdeer" is in his right fist. Indian tattooing on his chest. 
     His name is NATHANIEL POE. He's a few years older than Uncas. The French and      the French-speaking tribes know him as La Longue Carabine (Long Rifle). Other 
     frontiersmen in New York colony and the Iroquois and Delaware-speaking tribes 
     know him as Hawkeye. Sweat stains his shirt. He flashes through the tree 
     branches disturbing nothing. Making no sound. 

     HAWKEYE'S POV: A PIECE OF TAN

     two hundred and fifty yards away, a few square inches buried in the foliage ... 

     SUDDENLY HE STOPS

     Killdeer's at his shoulder ... 

     HAWKEYE'S THUMB

     cocks the lock holding the piece of flint: click. 

     UNCAS

     stops dead, holding out his hand ... no sound. 

     CHINGACHGOOK

     slips through young trees and stops, shouldering his smoothbore musket. Is this 
     an ambush? 

     HAWKEYE'S POV: RACK FOCUS THROUGH THE GUN SIGHT

     Five feet and fourteen pounds of rifle is elevated a half inch and shifted left, 
     off target. It's a precise, smooth movement. No human quiver. 

     KILLDEER'S TRIGGER

     tighter ... 

     THE COCK

     holding the flint hits the iron file of the frizzen, shooting sparks into the 
     pan of priming powder which flashes and ... 

     TAN
     is a huge elk that leaps at the sound. 

     KILLDEER'S MUZZLE

     CRACKS like lightning. 

     AN ELK

     leaps where the .59 caliber round was programmed to intercept him. On the moment 
     of impact ... 

     WIDE

     three men approach the fallen elk and each other. We realize they're hunting 
     together. Hawkeye steps aside for Chingachgook. His massive war club is flat and 
     angles to one side with a stabbing blade. Hawkeye is stepson and stepbrother. 
     The two younger men treat Chingachgook with an easy deference and affection. 
     Hawkeye's a dialectic of two cultures. In his coloration and worldliness he's 
     more the Anglo-Saxon frontiersman. In his independent views and candid manner 
     and in his combat skills and woodsmanship, he's more native American (Mohican). 
     As Chingachgook takes out his long knife and they approach the fallen elk ...] 
     
                         CHINGACHGOOK 
                    (low Mohican; sub-titled)
               We're sorry to kill you, Brother. 
               Forgive us. I do honor to your courage and 
               speed, your strength ...

     roasts potatoes on a stick in the stone fireplace next to CAPTAIN JACK WINTHROP, 
     an American in very worn quasi-military gear. On a rough table in the tiny cabin 
     ALEXANDRIA, his wife, is kneading bread. Three children climb on their father. 
     He grabs their wild seven year old son, JAMES, who shrieks laughter and dodges 
     away. The cabin has two primitive rooms, waxed paper windows, log walls. O.S. a 
     dog barks. Others pick it up. Cameron & Jack are suddenly alert, reaching for 
     weapons ...

               How is Chingachgook, then? 

     Behind him, emerging from the dark trees are Hawkeye, Uncas, cradling flint 
     locks, blankets and packs over their shoulders, leading a mule laden with skins 
     and the elk carcass. Crossing the splitrail fence ...

                         HAWKEYE
               Hello John. Cleared another quarter, I see. 

                         CAMERON
                    (shakes hands with Uncas)
               Yes, I did. 

     JAMES CAMERON

     tears past his father & runs full bore. Just before he's going to collide into 
     Uncas, he leaps into the air and Uncas snatches him with one hand and swings him 
     up onto his shoulders. The kid screams with delight and rides back towards the 
     cabin that way. Alexandria comes to the door.

     INTERIOR CABIN - CHINGACHGOOK - EVENING (LATER)

     lights & smokes a clay pipe. The scene says: this is a rustic, frontier home and 
     these people have known each other & live in dangerous circumstances. 

                         ALEXANDRIA
               If Uncas is with you, that means he has not 
               found a woman and started a family yet. 

                         CHINGACHGOOK
               Your eyes are too sharp, Alexandria Cameron. 
               They see into my heart. 

                         UNCAS
               Your farm good to you this year, John? 

                         CAMERON
               It was a good year for corn. 

                         UNCAS
               Mohawk field we saw was 5 mile long on 
               the river. Chief Joseph Brandt's field. 

                         CAMERON
               You take much fur? 

                         HAWKEYE
               That we did. John. But the horicane 
                    (sic)
               is near trapped out. 

                         JACK
               Tradin' your skins in Castleton? 

                         UNCAS
               No, Schylerville. With the Dutch for silver.
               French & English want to buy with wampum 
               & brandy. 

     Pause, then ... 

                         HAWKEYE
               So what is it, Jack? What brings you up here? 

                         JACK
               A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's 
               heading south to war against the English. I'm 
               here to raise this county's militia to aid the 
               British defense. 

                         HAWKEYE
               Folks here goin' to join in that fight? 

                         JACK
               We'll see in the morning ... 

                         CHINGACHGOOK
               Fathers of England & France, both, take more 
               land, furs, than they need. They're cold & full 
               of greed ... 

                         JACK
               Few'd deny that? Where you headin'? 

                         HAWKEYE
               Trap over the fall and winter among the 
               Delawares in Can-tuck-ee. 

                         UNCAS
               So I can find a woman and make Mohican 
               children so our father will leave my brother 
               & me in peace. 

     Alexandria laughs. So do Hawkeye & Chingachgook. 

                         JAMES
               A son like me? 

     Uncas grabs James & suspends him upside down.

                         UNCAS
               No. You are too strong. Turn me old 
               too fast! 

     Hawkeye grabs the kid from Uncas. The kid's laughing & can't stay still. 
     Chingachgook watches, content, smoking his clay pipe.

                         ALEXANDRIA
               That's what he's doin' to his mama ... 

     She ruffles his hair and lifts the heavy iron pot off the tibbet. Uncas goes to 
     help her, she shrugs his hand away and carries it to the table herself. The men 
     gather around. There's pan-baked bread, a dish of salt, and the pot has venison 
     and yellow cornmeal in a kind of stew. Everyone waits.

                         CAMERON
               Dear Father, thank you for rewardin' the fruits
               of our labor with plenty. Amen.

     CAMERON'S CABIN - (DAY)

     EXTERIOR CAMERON CABIN - MOHAWK BOY & JAMES CAMERON - MORNING

     slam into other kids as they battle through a Lacrosse game. In the background are
     sixty men, women and children. It's a community gathering held out of doors. 
     We've entered mid-scene. Captain Jack is standing on a box. Some women and kids
     mill around some tables and boards laid over barrels. Cooking fires. Smoke. 
     Most but not all around Captain Jack are men, nine settlers, 3 hunter/trappers, 
     eight Mohawk farmers in mixed European and native clothing. Off to the side are 
     an English Lieutenant on horseback and a ten-man escort from whatever regiment's in
     Albany. A man named HENRI speaks in French. His son, MARTIN, translates. 

                         HENRI
                    (O.S. in French)

                         MARTIN
                    (translates) 
               My father says he was driven out of France by 
               the black robe priests and he would fight them 
               now but he lost his arm and so I will go in his 
               place. 

     Meanwhile ... 

     ONGEWASGONE

     is an unusually large Mohawk in a blue match coat with a little girl holding his hand. He
     says something to Chingachgook who nods. Hawkeye and Uncas are a little apart in an
     outer grouping of the men. Ongewasgone is a war chief and wears a white plume and is
     tattooed. As Martin finishes, he steps forward. 

                         ONGEWASGONE
               John Cameron, thank you for your hospitality ... 
               Twin River Mohawk got no quarrel with Les 
               Francais. Trade furs with Les Francais. Now Les 
               Francais bring Huron onto Mohawk hunting grounds ... 

     These people are English, Scots-Irish and Dutch farmers; some French Huguenot
     "mechanics" (craftsmen). They're in shirt-sleeves and Indian moccasins & leggings. The
     Mohawks' vast lands and corn agriculture border the settlement. They 've been
     acculturated for over a hundred years. Some wear European calico hunting shirts.
     Their heads are shaved to scalping locks and many are tattooed. They've politically and
     commercially played France & England against each other very adroitly for over a
     hundred years because of their military power and geographic position. Their relations
     with working farmers and settlers and their families has been mostly one of 
     co-existence because there's always been more than enough for all. This is a WPA
      mural of ethnic diversity and plurality of frontier America. The Europeans are former
     indentured laborers, farmers exiled by economics or religious persecution, frontier
     hunters and trappers ... working people.

                         ONGEWASGONE
                    (continues) 
               Now Mohawk will fight Huron and Les Francais. 
               My brothers have asked me to lead them in this 
               war so I speak for the Twin River Council. 

     The importance of this commitment is apparent to the lieutenant. 

                         LIEUTENANT
               His Majesty King George II is very grateful for 
               your support. 

                         IAN
               How far up the valley?

                         COLONIAL #1
               ... two days from here. 

     Some don't like this.

                         LIEUTENANT
               It should be enough to remind you France is 
               the enemy. 

                         HAWKEYE
               Your enemy ... 

     Heads turn to Hawkeye at the periphery of the crowd.

                         LIEUTENANT
               What did you say? 

                         HAWKEYE
                    (loud)
               I said ... France is your enemy. Not ours. 

                         LIEUTENANT
               Really? Do you want them to overrun all 
               New York colony? 

                         HAWKEYE
               First place, you started it with the French over 
               fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio. 
                    (smiles) 
               Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on 
               their hands ... 

                         LIEUTENANT
                    (ignoring Hawkeye)
               Will you men help us stop the French? 

                         HAWKEYE
               ... and while they are cooped up in your fort, 
               what if the French send war parties to raid 
               their homes? 

                         IAN
               What then, Lieutenant? 

                         LIEUTENANT
               For your own homes, for king, for country, that's 
               why you men ought to join this fight! 

                         HAWKEYE
               You do what you want with your own scalp.
               Do not be tellin' us what to do
               with ours. 

                         LIEUTENANT
                    (furious; to Hawkeye)
               You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject? 

                         HAWKEYE
               ... No ... Do not call myself much of a subject 
               at all. 

     Light laughter.

                         COLONIAL #2
               Nathaniel's right. But if I got to fight, figure I'll 
               try and do it fifty miles north of here instead of 
               my bean field. 

                         AD LIBS
               Yes. Yeah. No ... 

                         CAMERON
               I am stayin' on my farm. And any man who goes,
               his family is welcome to fort-up with us 'til he 
               comes back. 

                         JACK
               Boys. My sense of it is enough of us will join-up to 
               fill the county's levy. But only if General Webb 
               accepts a few terms I got in mind ... 

     HAWKEYE & UNCAS

     cross through the people. A few men drift off to their women at the tables. 
     It is apparent two-thirds of the men will join. A couple of jokes, light banter,
     no hostility.

                    (O.S.) 
               Webb? what's that, Jack ...? 

     As they cross through they start removing their shirts and weapons.

                         IAN
               You boys marchin' with us? What do you say? 

                         UNCAS
               We had our say, Ian. 

     They approach the Lacrosse field. Chingachgook stands with Cameron in the
     background, watching. 

     LACROSSE FIELD

     Uncas joins James. Hawkeye goes on the other side. A couple of young Mohawks and
     a young blonde farmer shout hallo's and as the bodies crash into each other ...

     INTERIOR COACH - MAJOR DUNCAN HEYWARD - DAY

     sits erectly in the brilliant scarlet coat of the First Royal Regiment of Foot with gold
     braid, blue-black facing and blue-black breeches, cavalry boots, spurs, a tricorn, white
     wig (?) and a gorget (large medallion) around his neck. He's 28-30 and tough. He is
     self-sure, principled reactionary. He believes human society is static & layered into
     hierarchies of class and they are absolutely impermeable. He opens a simple gold-
     clasped case & contemplates its contents ... 

     HEYWARD'S POV: CASE

     an enameled portrait of a dark-haired young woman. 

     HEYWARD

     as a soldier is militarily first-rate in his milieu: the open battlefields of Europe. 
     Right now, however, he is about to enter the forests of North America. He closes 
     his clasp and glances out the window as we enter Albany and as a facade of 
     buildings & people pass.

     Four Grenadiers come to attention as Heyward enters mid-scene.

                         JACK
                    (O.S.)
               ... if they are not allowed leave to defend their 
               families if the French or Hurons attack the 
               settlements, no colonial militia is goin' to Fort 
               William Henry.

                         HEYWARD
                    (low)
               You, there. Help my man outside with the baggage. 

     GENERAL JEROME WEBB sees Heyward and nods. Three of Webb's Adjutants are
     on either side. Three remaining Grenadiers in bearskin-covered mitred caps are at the
     door. Facing Webb are a half dozen colonial representatives, including Captain Jack
     Winthrop. Heyward watches Jack ... 

                         LIEUTENANT
               They will report or be pressed into service! 

                         LARGE COLONIAL REP
               Any of the boys worth havin' can disappear into 
               forest ... time it takes you to blink. Where's that 
               leave ya, then? 

     Heyward, preparing to hand over dispatches, is interrupted by the insubordinate tone.
     Equally wound tightly is the Lieutenant.

                         LIEUTENANT
               They will be found! Arrested ... 

                         WEBB
                    (cuts in)
               I cannot imagine his Majesty, in his benevolence, 
               would ever object to his American subjects 
               defending their hearth & home, their women & children, 
               if threatened by the "scourge" of attack from savages, 
               aroused to such excess by our enemy, the 
               ever-perfidious French. 

                         JACK
               Does that mean they will be granted leave to 
               defend their homes if the settlements are 
               attacked? 

                         WEBB
               Of course. 

     Heyward's more amazed by what he's just heard from Webb. These Americans,
     including Jack, are streaming past him on their way out.

                         JACK
               You got yourself a colonial militia, General. 

                         HEYWARD
               Major Duncan Heyward reporting, Sir! 

     Webb's pouring gin.

                         WEBB
               Duncan. How was your journey? 

     The door closes. Dispatches are passed. They are now alone except for the General's
     two Adjutants and a shadowy form waiting patiently in a corner. He's MAGUA. In the
     dim light, he's motionless. Webb slides a glass across to Heyward.

                         HEYWARD
               I didn't experience anything so surprising from 
               Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today. 

                         WEBB
               And what is that? 

                         HEYWARD
               The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service? 

                         WEBB
               I know.
                    (assuming a co-commiserator)
               One has to give Americans "reasons" and make 
               agreements to get them to do anything at all. 
               Tiring, isn't it? 
                    (throws up his hands)
               But that's the way of it here. 

                         HEYWARD
                    (tight)
               I thought British policy is 'Make the 
               World ... England', sir. 

     A chill. Majors don't upbraid Generals.

                         WEBB
               You will take command of the 62nd Regiment 
               of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel 
               Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward. 

                         HEYWARD
               Sir! ... Might I enquire if General Webb has heard 
               from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to 
               rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them 
               to the fort. 

                         WEBB
               Yes. You may.
                    (to Magua, after a glance at Heyward)
               You there. What does Munro call you?
                    (to Heyward) 
               The "Scotsman" has sent one of his Indian allies 
               to guide you. 

     MAGUA

     rises and slowly walks into the light. He is reserved and over six feet tall. His head is
     shaved into a mohawk. Rings, beads & feathers pierce his ears. A blanket is worn as a
     shawl over his left shoulder exposing his right arm and heavy tattooing. A long
     tomahawk is in the belt of his breechcloth.

                         WEBB
               The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's 
               house. A company of the 33rd will accompany 
               you and Magua will show you the way. 

                         HEYWARD
               By your leave, sir. 

     Webb holds Heyward a moment

                         WEBB
                    (to Adjutants)
               Explain to the Major we care little about toying 
               with colonial militia because we have little to 
               fear from the French. They have not the nature 
               for war. Their Latinate voluptuousness combines with 
               their Gallic laziness and the result is: they would
               rather make love with their faces than fight. 

     Webb's Adjutants laugh uproariously at his wit. Heyward's stiff, perfunctory smile. He's
     been made the butt of the joke. He does not share Webb's derisive view of the French.
     Webb doesn't like Heyward's manner. We don't like Webb. Then:

                         WEBB
                    (continuing) 
               Dismissed. 

     Heyward stiffly salutes. Webb casually, perfunctorily salutes the younger man in
     return.

                         HEYWARD
                    (to Magua)
               Dawn. At the encampment. Six a.m. sharp. See 
               to it you're there.

     Beneath Magua's barely deferential manner we sense intelligence & menace. None of      these Brits see it. We do.

     EXTERIOR POLTROON'S HOUSE - DUNCAN HEYWARD - DAY

     brushed clean, his wig freshly powdered, his tricorn in his hand with a crimson sash and
     sword and his cavalry boots, walks through the gate after knocking. He enters a small
     courtyard. Suddenly he hears ... 

                         CORA
                    (O.S.)
               Heyward! Duncan Heyward. 

     Heyward looks to the side. An inner light turns on. In this mode, this is a man we could
     like. 

     REVERSE: CORA MUNRO

     enters from the garden. She's vivacious, dark-haired, unconventional in that she's
     educated, but with conventional values and attitudes. She hugs Duncan to her and 
     then pushes him away to look at him.

                         HEYWARD
               My God it's good to see you. 

     He takes her hand in both of his and kisses it. He is open and lit up.

     EXTERIOR POLTROON'S HOUSE, BACK YARD - CORA & HEYWARD - DAY

     A vegetable plot behind the Poltroon's house is a provincial substitute for a formal
     garden setting. Heyward and Cora sit on rough wooden chairs. Wind blows. In the
     background a servant hangs laundry. The white sheets billow. A table holds a tea
     setting. They're sitting close to each other, talking seriously and quietly. Duncan's
     jacket is removed. Time's passed. Long pause. Then:

                         CORA
               I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive ... after so 
               long apart and after you've traveled so far ... 

                         HEYWARD
               And by sea! 

                         CORA
               You still have an aversion to the water? 

                         HEYWARD
               Aversion? No. ... "Hatred" ... "Loathing" ... 

     Cora laughs.

                         HEYWARD
               But it was worth it all to end in a garden by 
               your side.

     She looks askance at him. Then the banter drops.

                         CORA
                    (difficult)
               Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest 
               friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect 
               you immensely ... I wish they did, but my feelings 
               don't go beyond that. Do you see? 

                         HEYWARD
               Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis 
               for a man and woman to be joined? And all 
               else may grow in time ...? 

                         CORA
               Some say that's the way of it. 

                         HEYWARD
               "Some"? 

                         CORA
               Cousin Eugenie, my father, but ... 

                         HEYWARD
                    (interrupts)
               Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, 
               we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let 
               those whom you trust, your father, help 
               settle what's best for you. In view of your 
               indecision, why not rely on their advice and 
               judgment as well as mine? 

     Cora stares directly at Heyward. Then she looks away. She has no answer. Something
     subterranean disturbs her about delegating judgment over the fate of her life.


                         HEYWARD
               Will you consider that? 

                         CORA
                    (pause; smiles)
               Yes. Yes, I will. 

     She's still unsettled.

      traveling dress reveals that Cora, two or three years older than Alice, is fuller and more

     three cradle their long guns and move silently on moccasined feet. 

     FRONTAL: CHINGACHGOOK

     - in a stream - relaxed but attentive, abruptly stops. The others freeze in their tracks.
     Chingachgook sees and then stoops to examine ... 

     ROCK

     under the water in the stream. It's been turned from its bed. Chingachgook finds
     another. Uncas, moving up on his flank, climbs the bank and moves off into the trees,
     searches and then he gestures ... he's found another sign of something. 

     CHINGACHGOOK

     has headed off further down the stream and discovers nothing. Rapidly he rejoins Uncas
     and Hawkeye who've become extremely alert. They move up the bank into the forest
     ninety degrees from their previous path. 

     TRACKING: HAWKEYE, UNCAS & CHINGACHGOOK

     moving. Fast. Nearly soundless. They hardly disturb a blade of grass. The impression:
     expertise, deadliness and an impression something's wrong. 

     CUT TO ...

     EXTERIOR FOREST, TRAIL - MAGUA - DAY 

     on point. The trail cuts the side of a hill. The ground on one side rises into a forest
     acclivity and on the other falls off into a forested ravine. Magua walking towards
     camera. 

     CLOSER - MAGUA'S

     slid his tomahawk out from the front of his belt that girdles his waist. He lets the shaft
     drop into his hand. He shrugs off his blanket. There is a solidity to his dark, tall figure
     we didn't see before. Magua turns about face and advances on the column. 
     TRACK WITH Magua.
     Heyward and the Munro girls pass the camera as does Sgt. Major Ambrose, marching
     in advance of the men. Magua is approaching the soldier on the left in the first row. 
     We see Magua has caught the Redcoat's eye.

     REDCOAT

     is curious, starts to smile. What does the Huron want to say to him? When Magua is
     two steps away he caves in the side of the infantryman's head at the temple with the
     spike end of his tomahawk and, backhanded, hacks the blade through the side of the
     neck of the center man in the first row. 

     SIMULTANEOUSLY

     thirteen muskets EXPLODE from the wooded rise. 

     FIVE REDCOATS

     are blown off the path, two others are wounded ... 

     AMBROSE

                         AMBROSE
               Form company! Left face! March! 

     ALICE

     shrieks. Cora grabs Alice's reins and her own. 

     HEYWARD

     pulling his fusil (short musket), seeing, firing, reaching for the women ... 

     CORA'S HORSE

     bucking. 

     ALICE'S HORSE

     bolting, dodging sideways, spilling Alice to the earth. 

     AMBROSE

                         AMBROSE
               Company make ready! 

     The regulars slam into a firing line, stepping over the bodies of their comrades. All
     thirteen face the incline. 

     FORESTED RISE - HURONS

     flash downhill through the trees. Partnered in two-man teams, one loads and prepares
     and fires while the other advances to the next cover. He, then, prepares and fires
     covering his partner's advance. Leaping fallen trees and boulders, they're athletic, fast
     and rapidly closing.
     Even though the disciplined English regulars are a killing machine, we now see their
     tactics in the dense forest are grossly inferior to the Hurons' ... 

                         AMBROSE
               Present!! 

     CORA

     covers Alice with her body, holding the reins of their bolting horses. 

     HEYWARD

     from horseback aims his horse pistol, FIRES ... 

     AN ATTACKING HURON

     leaping at him past Alice & Cora drops. 

     MULE

     with baggage crashes off, down the ravine. Another two Redcoats drop. Nine left.
     Then eight. 

     AMBROSE

                         AMBROSE
               Fire!! 

     A musket volley as eight muskets go off as one shot, sending a lead scythe through
     leaves. But ... 

     REVERSE:

     Hurons were behind cover. Only one was exposed and hit. 

                         AMBROSE
                    (continuing)
               Load! Prime! 

     The English rush to complete the reload. Will they do it in time? 

                         AMBROSE
                    (continuing)
               Present! Present! 

     Suddenly, Hurons - en masse - CRASH down onto the Redcoats line with tomahawks,
     war clubs and point-blank musket fire. 

     ALICE

     on the ground, screaming insanely, covered by Cora who's protecting her little sister,
     and ... 

     HEYWARD'S

     horse shot from beneath him, the animal folding, falling straight to the earth, and ... 

     MAGUA

     shoots Ambrose in the chest, and ... 

      HEYWARD

     by the Munro daughters spins, swinging his fusil like a ball-bat, upending one Huron
     and lunges with his bayonet in his left towards another. But this Huron easily slips the
     thrust and slams Heyward with his rifle butt. 

     BRITISH

     dead and dying. 

     AMBROSE

     blood gushing from his chest wound, fires his pistol, dropping a Huron; slashes a
     second with his sword. Then he's chopped down. Hurons begin scalping the British
     while four race towards Heyward and the two women. 

     HEYWARD & CORA & ALICE

     ready to die. Heyward has only his fusil as a bludgeon. He readies ... 

     THREE LOUD SHOTS

     BLOW three of the Hurons sideways, head over heels down the rise. 

     REVERSE: THREE MEN

     barely seen, running diagonally across the fall line of the ravine. In parts, we recognize
     Nathaniel, recharging Killdeer on full run, and Uncas. 

     HURON'S

     not sure where the shots came from. Suddenly Chingachgook slams him, head first into
     the ravine with the war club. He didn't even slow down. 

     HURON

     warrior spins. Uncas tomahawks his shoulder. The Huron swings downwards. Uncas
     ducks beneath the swing and slashes his throat, sending him downhill into CAMERA 
     as ... 

     HAWKEYE'S

     momentum and thrown tomahawk spread-eagles one Huron, near a couple of wounded
     Redcoats who fight on ... 

     MAGUA

     calmly sees the odds have changed. His attention becomes focused. He commits a very
     revealing act seen through the blurred foreground action of struggling bodies. We will
     remember it. He raises his musket and aims at ... 

     CORA MUNRO

     who's unaware she's a target. Why is he singling out a Munro girl to kill? 

     HAWKEYE

     sees. Killdeer's at his shoulder ... 

     TIME SLOWS: MAGUA

     senses Hawkeye. Moving through liquid, his eyes drift left. The moment is frozen.
      Their eyes lock, each to the other's. Then ... 

     TIME UNFREEZES

     Magua swings at Hawkeye and FIRES ... 

     HAWKEYE

     shifts. The .65 caliber musket ball rockets past his ear and he's already squeezing
     Killdeer's trigger as ... 

     HAWKEYE'S POV OVER BARREL: SMOKE

     from Magua's musket blast clears. Magua's gone. He almost shape-shifted, it happened
     so quickly. It's nearly mystical. 

     HAWKEYE

     lowers Killdeer, impressed. 

     CORA

     glances back at Hawkeye. She doesn't know why he's looking at her. 

     CHINGACHGOOK

     pursues two fleeing Hurons up the incline. Two strides gain him the first man, who he
     hamstrings and runs over to pursue the second up the hill ... as ... 

     HEYWARD

     in the confused melee, grabs a found musket and aims it at an Indian. We recognize that
     he's aiming at Chingachgook pursuing the second Huron up the hill ... 

                         CORA
               No, Duncan! 

     Duncan ignores her. 

     HEYWARD'S MUSKET

     is jerked from his hands.

                         HAWKEYE
                ... case your aim is any better'n your judgment. 

     He's drawn his sword, reflexively. Hawkeye flips the musket around one-handed. It's
     pointed at Heyward's chest. And Hawkeye FIRES, killing an attacking Huron behind
     Heyward. As Heyward spins ... 

     CHINGACHGOOK'S WAR CLUB

     flashes up the hill. It cleaves the second man's back and bowls him over. Chingachgook
     retrieves his club as his scalping knife slashes down ... 

     UNCAS

     scalps the man he killed. Chingachgook dispatches the Huron he hamstrung. 

     WIDE

     Sudden silence. Heyward's motionless. The women are frozen, as terrified of the
     savages and apparent half-breed rescuers as they were of those who attacked them. 

     ALICE

     Cora, holding her, is stunned but functioning. Moments ago both women were clean
     and demure. Now their riding dresses are torn, mud-stained, blood-spattered and their
     baggage is gone. 

     HEYWARD'S

     crossed to his slaughtered soldiers. Moments ago they were a testament to British
     military power. Now they're dead meat. Ambrose's body is against a tree. In the B.G.      two of the wounded start to rise ... 

                         ALICE
                    (O.S.)
               Stop it! 

     Heyward spins. 

      UNCAS

     just cut the throat of the second Narraganset. It drops into the brush. Alice attacks
     him.

                         ALICE
               We need them to get out of here! 

     Uncas gently restrains her. Cora reaches Alice and grabs her away from the "savage".
     Heyward runs in to protect the women ...

                         HEYWARD
                    (to Nathaniel)
               ... why the bloody hell he do that to the horses?! 

     Uncas, all business, is now reloading, lifting powder horns, scanning the trees.

                         UNCAS
                    (matter of fact) 
               ... too easy to track ... they can be heard for 
               miles ... find yourself a musket ... 

     Cora's surprised by Uncas' easy English. Hawkeye's scanning the forest.

                         HAWKEYE
                    (to Heyward)
               Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany. 
               They'll never make a passage north. 

                         HEYWARD
                    (breathless)
               We were headed ... 

                         HAWKEYE
                    (appropriating a knife)
               ... Fort William Henry. 

     CHINGACHGOOK

     to Hawkeye: let's go ... Then a fast exchange of Delaware. Cora's surprised to see it's
     Chingachgook's decision. Chingachgook looks at the survivors, gives his assent, starts
     off.

                         HAWKEYE
               ... take you as far as the fort. 

     Hawkeye throws Heyward a musket. Cora & Alice look towards Heyward. He looks at
     them: the women are totally terrified and do not move.

                         HAWKEYE
               If we are goin' to take you, we need to move. 
               Fast ... And the fort is well off our course. 
               So if you all rather wait for the next Huron 
               war party to come by, we'll be on our way. 

     Heyward quickly decides to go. The women follow. Hawkeye starts off after Uncas and
     Chingachgook. 

     CUT TO ...

     EXTERIOR FOREST - HAWKEYE - DAY

     moves through the trackless forest. Uncas is far out on the left flank. Cora, Alice &
     Duncan Heyward follow in Hawkeye's and Chingachgook's steps ... 

     HAWKEYE'S FEET

     walking through a creek, stepping in the stream bed instead of on stones. The others
     follow. Hawkeye looks at Heyward. 

     HEYWARD

     conforms. He's ill at ease not being in command, following the lead of some half-Indian
     frontiersman through a foreign wilderness.] 

                         HEYWARD
               How far is it, scout? 

                         HAWKEYE
               Day and a half 
                    (pause) 
               Where did you get ... the guide? 

                         HEYWARD
               Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our 
               Mohawk allies. 

                         HAWKEYE
               He is Huron and nothing else. 
                    (checking the Munro girls are 
                    not too close)
               Why would he want to murder the girl? 

                         HEYWARD
               What?! 

                         HAWKEYE
               Dark haired ... 

                         HEYWARD
               Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on 
               her before today. 

                         HAWKEYE
               No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult? 

                         HEYWARD
               Of course not! 
                    (pause) 
               And how is it you were nearby? 

                         HAWKEYE
               Came across the war party, tracked 'em. 

                         HEYWARD
               Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry? 

                         HAWKEYE
               No. 

                         HEYWARD
               Fort Edward, then? 

                         HAWKEYE
               No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee. 

                         HEYWARD
               I thought all our colonial scouts were in 
               the militia? 

     Off to the side, Uncas smiles at the idea.

                         HAWKEYE
               I ain't your "scout". And I am in no damn 
               militia. 

                         HEYWARD
                    (stops) 
               Then you are one of those who would allow 
               England to fight alone while she protects 
               you from France? 

                         HAWKEYE
               England does not protect me and does not 
               war against France on our account. She uses 
               us to war against France on her own account ... 
               of greed for land and furs. 

     CORA'S

     appalled.

                         HAWKEYE
                    (turns) 
               Clear it up any? 

                         HEYWARD
                    (loud) 
               I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out! 

                         HAWKEYE
                    (low)
               Do not let gratitude get in the way ... 

     Cora's hand holds back Heyward's sword arm because suddenly Chingachgook looms
     over him.

                         CHINGACHGOOK
                    (to Hawkeye) 
               Yengeese no good in woods. Make more 
               noise, I kill him. 

     Heyward spins. Hawkeye coolly watches Cora. Her attitude is hostile; aligned with
     Heyward. He turns away. Meanwhile ... 

     UNCAS

     stops, alarmed. Something in the air bothers him. Hawkeye smells it, too. 

     CHINGACHGOOK

     is already moving out front, low and fast ... 

     CUT TO ...

     EXTERIOR FOREST, TREE LINE - GREEN BRANCHES - DAY

     After we HOLD, we realize Chingachgook's been there all along. Hawkeye and Uncas
     join him where the branches meet the ground. Smoke drifts through the trees. 
     Hawkeye sees and dips his head, then looks again ... 

     EXTERIOR CAMERON CABIN - WIDE - DAY

     Burned, smoldering, having fallen in on itself. TRACK LEFT past what was the
     doorway. A dead child's hand protruding from the ruin. A fragment of a dress. Charred
     and smoldering wood. John Cameron's body in the wreckage. And then, through the
     collapsed posts and timbers, Hawkeye, Chingachgook and Uncas have advanced and
     are seeing what we've just seen; and then Cora and Alice. 

     ALICE

     approaches and is frozen in horror. Cora shields her from the sight. Cora is affected but
     confronts it directly.

                         HEYWARD
                    (O.S.) 
               Anything to be done? 

     UNCAS

     returns from under one part of the wreckage, ashen, stoic, as they all are. We know the
     degree of their inner pain.

                         UNCAS
               All dead ... 

     HAWKEYE

     bends over a moccasin print that Chingachgook's examining. They look at each other
     grimly. Heyward joins them.

                         HEYWARD
               Who were these people? 

                         HAWKEYE
                    (re: print) 
               Ottawa! 

                         HEYWARD
               Excuse me ... 

                         CHINGACHGOOK
                    (to Hawkeye) 
               Ottawa. 

     UNCAS

     enters, very careful where he places his feet ... Hawkeye gestures to Heyward to stay
     where he is: on the periphery with the women.

                         UNCAS
               Mirrors ... tools ... clothes ... all inside. 

                         HAWKEYE
                    (to Chingachgook)
               Movin' fast, not able to carry much ... 
               this was a war party? 

     Chingachgook nods confirmation and indicates a direction in Mohican. The significance
     is very ominous to them. We don't know why yet. Chingachgook starts away ... 

                         HEYWARD
               Let us look after them ... 

     He starts approaching the bodies.

                         CHINGACHGOOK
               Leave them. 

     Heyward stops. Hawkeye and Uncas follow Chingachgook, leaving the cabin.

                         CORA
                    (hasn't moved)
               Though they are strangers, they are at 
               least entitled to a Christian burial! 

                         HAWKEYE
                    (shaking his head) 
               Let us go, miss. 

                         CORA
               I will not. I have seen the face of war 
               before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on
               women and children. And almost as 
               cruel is your indifference. 

     Hawkeye turns back and rapidly approaches her. She takes a step back, fearful.

                         HAWKEYE
                    (contained)
               Miss Munro.
                    (pause)
               They are not strangers .... 
               And they stay as they lay ...! 

     CORA

     realizes Hawkeye knew these people and is deeply affected. She also realizes for the
     first time this is a whole new world with dynamics and complexities, behavior and
     rhythms she doesn't understand. He turns away from her and walks on. She hesitates a
     moment. 

     WIDE ON THE SMALL CLEARING IN FRONT OF THE FARMHOUSE

     as Chingachgook and Hawkeye, extremely alert and cradling their cocked flintlocks,
     walk to camera, eyes sweeping the forest perimeter; they're followed by Cora, Heyward
     helping Alice and Uncas as rearguard.

     The ruined cabin and the dead dream of a family smolders behind them. 

     CUT TO ...

     EXTERIOR GLADE - PROFILE: HAWKEYE - NIGHT

     moves through to where the trees seem sparse and are unnaturally white birch and
     some thin grass grows. The land rises into a mound. Chingachgook and the others
     avoid stepping on the grass and cross to the other side of it. 

     CHINGACHGOOK

     mutters something to Uncas. He nods and disappears amongst the white birch,
     soundlessly. 

     HAWKEYE

     throws Heyward a blanket. Heyward spreads the blanket below the top of the mound
     and - maintaining silence - he gestures for Cora & Alice to rest there. 

     ALICE'S HEAD

     hits the blanket. She curls into a fetal position and she's out. Heyward is nearby on
     watch.
     Hawkeye has taken a position two-thirds of the way around the crescent shaped
     mound.
     Cora has sought him out. 

     HAWKEYE

     doesn't react as Cora enters. He's scanning the trees; not looking at her. 
     They whisper ... 

                         CORA
               Why didn't you bury those people? 

                         HAWKEYE
               Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would 
               see it as a sign of our passing ... 

                         CORA
               You knew them. 

     Hawkeye looks at her and nods.

                         CORA
                    (stiffly)
               You were acting for our benefit. And I 
               apologize. I misunderstood you. 

                         HAWKEYE
               Well that is to be expected. My father ... 

                         CORA
               Your "father"? 

                         HAWKEYE
               Chingachgook. He warned me about 
               people like you. 

                         CORA
               He did? 

                         HAWKEYE
               Yes. He said ... "do not try to make them 
               understand you." 

                         CORA
               What?! 

                         HAWKEYE
               Yes. And "do not try to understand them. 
               That is because they are a breed apart and 
               they make no sense ..." 

     Cora's indignation is cut off because ... 

     UNCAS

     moving fast. He gestures back the way he came and it means they're in jeopardy. Uncas
     disappears around the mound. 

     CUT TO ... 

     EXTERIOR BIRCH FOREST - TREES - NIGHT

     Nothing. Imperceptibly we move closer and start to see shapes blocking out part of the
     white birch. 

     RED-PAINTED FACE

     white eyes. A ruff of red hair stands straight up at the back of the large man's head. 
     Slit and monstrously elongated earlobes are weighted with silver. He's followed by
     others. Wary, silently, they hunt. 

     DEEPER: MORE OTTAWA

     Towards the rear are two French Rangers ("Coureurs des Bois") from Le Regiment de
     la Sarre. They're bearded, dirty, dressed Indian-style in moccasins, leggings and
     breechcloths with hooded hunting shirts. There's nothing clumsy about them. They're
     the 18th century version of Special Forces who've gone indigenous. If they and the
     Ottawa find our people, it's all over. 

     ALICE

     seeing the red-painted Ottawa approach, starts to panic. Her hyperventilating and
     involuntary small sounds of fear will reveal their position. A hand covers her mouth and
     silences her struggling. WIDEN. It's Uncas. His other arm is around her, holding her,
     looking towards the advancing Ottawa. 

     HAWKEYE

     on his back, his tomahawk within reach on the ground. 

     OTTAWA & FRENCH

     are fifty yards away from the crescent mound behind which lie our people. Mist
     envelops them ... 

     CHINGACHGOOK

     His massive arms spread revealing his war club in his left fist; his fusil in his right hand. 

     HAWKEYE

     waiting for the attack. Cora's eyes are anxious, but there's no terror there. Nathaniel's
     impressed with her cool. He hands her a pistol. She takes it. He listens for the soft drop
     of moccasined feet ... 

     OTTAWA

     through the grass. Thirty feet away they stop. They're motionless. Then their leader
     gestures and they start backing out. The French Rangers continue towards the crescent.
     The Ottawa chief takes one's arm and stops him. The French Ranger whispers
     something inaudible. The Ottawa chief shakes his head, "Non. Pas possible ..." 
     And means it. They retreat. 

     SEPERATE SHOTS: HAWKEYE, UNCAS, CHINGACHGOOK, CORA

     tensely monitor the Ottawa retreat. 

     UNCAS & ALICE

     He slowly removes his hand from her mouth. She's a little shy, then she looks up,
     catches his eyes. Then she averts her face. 

     CHINGACHGOOK

     sees all of it; doesn't like it. 

     HAWKEYE

     The Ottawa are gone.

                         CORA
                    (quietly)
               Why did they turn back? 

     In answer Hawkeye looks behind & above her head.

     CORA

     turns and makes out stilt platforms of skeletons and torn strips of buckskin silhouetted
     against the night sky in the distance. They have camped on sanctified ground, a burial
     place. 

     CORA & HAWKEYE

     She thinks it would be a mistake to ever underestimate the skill of these men or the
     danger & complexity of this place. She hands the pistol back to him. Their hands almost
     touch.

                         CORA
                    (still pissed off)
               "We're a breed apart and we make no 
               sense" ...? 

                         HAWKEYE
                    (smiles) 
               In your particular case, miss, I would 
               make some allowance ... 

                         CORA
                    (sarcastic)
               Thank you so much. 

     Cora is angry. Hawkeye, staring at the trees, glances at her. She settles, looking at him.
     Her mood changes. Then ... 

                         CORA
               You called Chingachgook your "father"?
               Where is your real family? 

     Hawkeye's surprised by her question.

                         HAWKEYE
               They buried my ma & pa and my sisters.
               And Chingachgook - who found me with 
               two French trappers - raised me up as his 
               own. 

                         CORA
               I'm sorry. 

                         HAWKEYE
               I do not remember them. I was one or two. 

                         CORA
               How did you learn English? 

                         HAWKEYE
               My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend 
               Wheelock's school when I was ten. So
               we would know both worlds ... though 
               we were told only bother learning readin' &
               arithmetic from yous. 

                         CORA
               And what were the consequentialities of 
               European culture you didn't bother with? 

                         HAWKEYE
               The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas 
               about the government of men. My father's 
               people already know each man is his own 
               nation. And only he can have dominion 
               over himself. Not kings. No man is better 
               than any other man. 

                         CORA
               In London those radical ideas could land 
               you in Newgate prison. 
                    (changing the subject)
               Why were those people living in this 
               defenseless place ...? 

                         HAWKEYE
               'Cos frontier land's the only land affordable
               to poor people. So after seven years 
               indentured service in Virginia, they headed
               out here where they are beholden to none
               and not livin' by another's leave ... 
               Their name was Cameron. John & Alexandria.

     Cora sees the slate grey clouds and, in between, the fields of stars. She looks at      Hawkeye; then again up at the night sky. 

                         HAWKEYE
                    (continuing; looking up)
               My father's people say ... at the birth of the 
               sun and of his brother, the moon, their 
               mother died ... so the sun gave to the earth 
               her body, from which was to spring all life.
               And he drew forth from her breast the stars.
               The stars he threw into the night sky to 
               remind him of her soul. 
                    (the sky)
               So there is the Camerons' monument ... 
               my folks', too, I guess. 

     CORA'S

     pensive. Hawkeye's watching her. Her reaction is enigmatic. After a pause ... 

                         CORA
                    (low)
               You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not 
               understand what is happening here.
               And it is not as I imagined it would be, 
               thinking of it in Boston and London ... 

                         HAWKEYE
               Sorry to disappoint you ... 

                         CORA
                    (eyes downcast)
               On the contrary. It is more deeply stirring ... 
               to my blood ...
                    (then up into his eyes)
               ... than any imagining could possibly have 
               been ... 

     She closes her eyes, turns slightly and prepares to sleep. Hawkeye is the one left staring
     into the birch forest, a little surprised. Some of his assumptions about her were 
     wrong ... 

     CUT TO ...

     EXTERIOR FOREST - WIDE - LATE AFTERNOON

     Deep fog has set in. A hand entering the frame scares the hell out of us. It moves a
     branch aside. It's Uncas. Spread to the right is Chingachgook, far to the left is
     Hawkeye. They hike up a steep forested slope in the heart of the Adirondacks.

                         CORA
               Much further? 

                         HAWKEYE
               Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are 
               downhill of it. 

     ALICE

     Re-energized, her spirits pick up.

                         ALICE
               Will we be able to bathe? 

     Before Cora can answer they hear a deep, rolling roar. Alice is alarmed.

                         CORA
               Thunder ... Papa will arrange something. 

     UNCAS

     looks over his shoulder, sees something in the far distance, gestures to Hawkeye and
     Chingachgook. 

     HAWKEYE'S POV: DISTANT HILLS

     and the band of red-painted Ottawa and Coureurs des Bois, who have now split into
     two groups, are still on their trail. Meanwhile, oblivious ...

                         HEYWARD
               The men of the regiment will fetch water from 
               the lake, build fires and provide every comfort 
               you desire, Alice ... 

                         ALICE
               Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora 
               doesn't marry you, I shall. 

                         CORA
               Alice! 

     Heyward laughs. Hawkeye sees them. It bothers us: will these Europeans, including
     Cora, shed their frontier experience?

                         ALICE
               I can't wait to see Papa ... 

                         CORA
               And you, Duncan? What are you looking 
               forward to? 

                         HEYWARD
               Posting to a different continent. 

     He and Alice laugh. Cora does not.

                         CORA
               I think it's very important and exciting. 

     Heyward looks at her. She's not kidding. 

     ANOTHER ANGLE: HEYWARD

     helps Alice. As he does, he stares at Cora's seperation and now her proximity to
     Hawkeye, who's walking on ahead, is something Heyward doesn't like. His dark
     thoughts are distracted by a FLASH of light and more ROLLING THUNDER. 

     WIDE FROM THE FRONT - HAWKEYE

     drops and pulls Cora to the ground.

                         CORA
               Lightning? 

     Hawkeye doesn't answer as he, Chingachgook, Uncas and Heyward make their way to
     the top of the ridge. 

     CLOSER ANGLES: CORA & ALICE

     join them and look down upon their expectation of a secure piece of England in the
     wilderness, a safe harbor, a father's warm welcome. 

     THEIR POV: FORT WILLIAM HENRY

     is none of those things. The thunder is the roar of French siege cannon clouded in dense
     smoke. The flashes of light are mortar bombs exploding and illumination rockets' red
     glare. Fort William Henry is under a massive siege by a French and Huron army. 

     UNCAS

     looks over his shoulder. 

     HIS POV: OTTAWA

     pursuing them. There's no way back. They're propelled forward. 

     DISSOLVE TO ...

     EXTERIOR BATTLEFIELD, FRENCH BATTERY #1 - CLOSE SHOTS - DUSK

     French cannons roar black smoke and gouts of red flame. 

     TRENCH

     dug by sappeurs behind the cover of a huge gambio pushed toward the fort by two
     poles and fascis on the sides. 

     ENGLISH GUN CREW

     searching the night. 

     POV: BATTLEFIELD

     is black. 

     ENGLISH ROCKETS

     light the battlefield revealing the French trenches. 

     ENGLISH GUN CREW

     excited. Colonial militia and Mohawk snipers fire their rifles. The British gun crew
     scrambles to adjust their 18 pounders. 

     FRENCH BATTERY #1 

     FIRES. 

     FRENCH BATTERY #2

     FIRES. 

     EXTERIOR FORT, WEST BATTERY

     TRACKING. French cannon FIRE rips into the fortifications, exploding wood and
     earth, shredding the English gun crew with cannister. The English fight stubbornly, but
     we feel they're outgunned. Meanwhile ... 

     WIDE ANGLE FROM THE WATER

     A new artillery duel erupts. The action is to the west side of the fort. On the north, the
     fire fight is reflected on the black water of Lake George in our foreground. Then a dark
     shape wiping to the right cuts off those reflections. We see in silhouette the outline of a
     birch canoe moving silently, barely rippling the mirrored surface of the lake. 

     EXTERIOR LAKE GEORGE BANK - DEBRIS

     Behind it, two Canadiens and a Huron alternately snipe at the ramparts. 

     LOW & WIDE: SNIPERS

     Behind them is black water. Its surface is broken by the rising mass of Chingachgook,
     followed by Uncas and Hawkeye. Muzzle flashes from the cannon reveal the canoe and
     the forms of the girls further out. Chingachgook's war club is held low. The Huron
     senses and turns and Hawkeye's thrown tomahawk knocks him back. Hawkeye's knife
     flashes in the night. Chingachgook drives the war club up, smashing a Canadien onto
     the debris. The second Canadien jabs bayonet at Uncas, slashing his side. Uncas jerks
     him forward by the musket, folds him over and tomahawks him. 

     CUT TO ...

     EXTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY, NORTH WALL - SALLY-PORT TUNNEL
     - NIGHT

     Amidst the cannonade roar, ad-libbed shouts from Hawkeye and Heyward convince
     battle begrimed soldiers to open the sally-port. Our people rush in. 

     TORCH LIGHT

     the group moves through the long, dank, tunnel. Enlisted men escorting them. Another
     torch from the other direction: CAPTAIN BEAMS is revealed.

                         HEYWARD
               I'm Major Duncan Heyward! 

                         BEAMS
               Captain Jeffrey Beams. We didn't think 
               you'd make it through! 

                         HEYWARD
               Where's Colonel Munro? His daughters are 
               here, too. 

     Beams raises his torch, sees the muddied, soaked women. He is shocked that they
     traveled with Heyward. 

     CUT TO ...

     INTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY, PARADE GROUND - GROUP - NIGHT

     emerges from a sally-port tunnel. It's smokey. NOISE is deafening. The group has
     traveled through a nightmare, only to arrive in hell. 

     HEYWARD WITH BEAMS, CORA & HAWKEYE, ALICE, UNCAS &
     CHINGACHGOOK

     run diagonally past pyramidal stacks of cannon ball, smoldering beams and shrapnel,
     wounded men. Just then a mortar is fired and explodes, killing the gun crew. On the
     ramparts Mohawks and Colonial Militia, sniping at the French. Women huddle in 
     corners next to the sick and dying. 

     UNDER RAMPARTS: MILITIA

               joinin'-up.

               Dropped in to see how you boys is doin'. 

     COLONEL MUNRO

     running from his quarters is shocked to see them.

                         ALICE

                    (enraged) 
               Why are you here?! 

     Cora is stunned. Alice is decimated by her father's anger. Munro sees and whips off his
     coat to cover them and takes Alice under his arm. Bombardment resumes. Alice clings
     while they race for the cover of his quarters:] 

                         MUNRO
                    (to Heyward; re: Alice & Cora) 
               Why did you allow them to come? ... And
               where the bloody hell are my reinforcements!! 

     They race into the yellow lantern light of Munro's quarters and slam and bolt the heavy
     door. Heyward's confused ...

               There was no letter. 

                         MUNRO
               I sent three men to Webb! 

                         HEYWARD
               One called Magua arrived. 

                         CORA
               He delivered no such message. 

     Munro's stunned.

                         MUNRO
               Does Webb not even know we are besieged? 

                         HEYWARD
               Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does 
               not know to send reinforcements! 

     Munro has nowhere for his rage to go. Meanwhile, Alice clings to her father. At 45-55,
     the British Army has been his life. He blindly believes in its institutions, though officers
     like Webb would disdain his Scots origins. 
     From under his fury: 

                         MUNRO
                    (flat)
               What happened to you? 

                         HEYWARD
                    (suddenly tired) 
               Ambush ... on the George Road. This
               Magua led us into it.
                    (pause)
               ... eighteen killed. It's these men who 
               saved us. They guided us here ... 

                         MUNRO
               Thank you. How can I reward you? 

     No answer. Then ...

                         HAWKEYE
               Help ourselves to a few horns from your 
               powder stores. 

                         MUNRO
               What else? 

                         UNCAS
               Some food. 

                         MUNRO
                    (to Uncas)
               I'm indebted to you. And get your side sewn up, 
               young man. 

     MUNRO

     sees his exhausted and bloodstained surgeon in the doorway that leads to the next
     rooms. 

                         MUNRO
                    (bellows) 
               Mr. Phelps! 

     PHELPS' face lights up when he sees Cora Munro.

                         PHELPS
               Miss Cora! How are you? 

                         CORA
                    (smiles) 
               Fine, Mr. Phelps. Have you cat gut and a 
               suturing needle? 
                    (for Uncas)
               And we could use some rum, clothes, and 
               a place to wash ... 

     Cora tries to remove Alice from her father, but she clings to him. Munro holds her
     tighter. Then he whispers something to her. She nods her head. And Cora takes her.
     They exit. 

     MUNRO

     is moved beyond words by his daughters' presence. There's a break, a pause ...

                         MUNRO
                    (to Heyward over table map)
               What a place for them ... 


                         HEYWARD
               Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given 
               that I've seen of the French engineering from 
               the ridge above? 

                         MUNRO
                    (perfunctory)
                Logistics are his guns are bigger than mine 
               and he has more of them. They keep our heads 
               down while his sappers make thirty yards of 
               trench a day. His thirteen inch mortars have a 
               two hundred yard range, so when they're close 
               enough, they'll move them in, lob explosive 
               rounds over our walls and pound us to dust. 

                         HEYWARD
               They look to be three hundred yards out. 
               You have three days. 

                         MUNRO
               Bloody murderers. 

                         HAWKEYE
               A man, here, can make a run straight through 
               to Webb. 

                         MUNRO
               ... not enough time to get to Albany and back 
               with reinforcements ... 

     A Sergeant enters, snaps to attention, says something to Beams, exits.

                         HEYWARD
               Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to 
               Fort Edward two days ago. 

                         MUNRO
               Webb's at Edward? 

                         HEYWARD
               Yes, sir. 

                         MUNRO
               Only twelve miles away! He could be here day 
               after tomorrow. 
                    (to Hawkeye)
               Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you 
               the message. 

     Beams nods. Munro turns back to the map. Hawkeye has something else to say.

                         HAWKEYE
               John Cameron's cabin. We come upon it last 
               night. Burned out. Everyone murdered. And 
               it was Ottawa. They're allied to the French. 

     Munro looks at him.

                         MUNRO
               Yes, Mr. Poe? So? 

                         HAWKEYE
               It was a war party. It means they're on the 
               attack up and down the frontier. 

     Munro turns to look at him for a long beat. Munro doesn't like what his response must
     be to this news. He turns to Heyward and the map.

                         MUNRO
                    (cold)
               Thank you. 

     Hawkeye's dismissed, frozen out.

                         HAWKEYE
               Many men here, their homes are in the path. 

                         MUNRO
               That's all, sir. 

     Hawkeye is furious. Chingachgook gestures Hawkeye out. He leaves Munro's quarters
     almost knocking over an entering Adjutant who backs way up to let Chingachgook
     pass.

                         HEYWARD
               Things were done. Nobody was spared ... 

                         MUNRO
               Terrible feature of war in the Americas. 
                    (beat; a mantra)
               Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty. 
               Our duty is to defeat France. That hangs 
               on a courier to Webb.

     INTERIOR MONTCALM'S MARQUEE - CHORAL GROUP - NIGHT

     of three Seneca women and five boys, led by a Jesuit, sing the Te Deum in the Iroquois
     language. This is a large tent that could sleep twenty. Montcalm's four personal guards
     are at the entrance as well as COMTE DE LEVIS in dirty lace, a facial wound and a
     braceful of pistols on a sash. Inside is simple campaign furniture and a six by eight foot
     battle standard and flag of France. 

     MONTCALM

     stands with a huge and fearsome elaborately tattooed and robed Seneca chief in a silk
     turban ...

                         SENECA CHIEF
                    (low)
               ... and the Black Robes of Michilimackinac left 
               us no time to put our cabins in order before telling 
               us our French father had need of our aid. We rolled 
               our blankets and were the first to be here. Yet we 
               are not the first and closest to my father's campfire. 

     The Marquis de Montcalm is forty-five, wears a large wampum belt as a sash over his
     waistcoat. He has an acute intellect, an elegant manner. He is more aristocratic than
     Munro, but a consummate professional soldier. Over the Seneca's shoulder, Montcalm
     sees and nods to ... 

     MAGUA

     entering with four Huron braves. This is not the Magua we saw on the trail. In his scalp
     lock, now red-stained and cut to a Huron roach, are three blacl plumes. A match-coat
     blanket drapes his left shoulder. 

                         MONTCALM
                    (to Seneca Chief)
               For my children and the children of the true 
               faith, my friendship and esteem is boundless ... 
               I will give you three oxen for a feast and tomorrow 
               I, myself, will sing the war song with you in the 
               great council house. 

     The Seneca Chief is satisfied and his people, plus the Jesuit, exit. The look on Magua's
     face and the wry expression on Montcalm's allows us to understand their relationship is
     based on realpolitik.

                         MONTCALM
               Le Renard Subtil, how are things with your 
               English friends? 

     Magua exhales in derision as he brings a chair to face Montcalm and sits, European
     style ...

                         MONTCALM
                    (over his shoulder)
               Louis Antoine, join us. 

     LOUIS ANTOINE DE BOUGAINVILLE enters. He wears a functional melange of
     Indian moccasins over white linen breeches and an officer's waistcoat. 

                         MONTCALM
               Hear what le Subtil has to tell us ... 

     Bougainville published a book on integral calculus at twenty-five, at twenty-six was a
     secretary to the French Ambassador in London, in January 1756 at twenty-seven he
     was elected a member of the British Royal Academy of Science and at age twenty-eight
     he's aide de camp to the Marquis de Montcalm with the rank of captain. Later in life, he
     brought "bougainvillea" from Tahiti to Europe to America.

                         MAGUA
               English war chief, Webb goes to Fort Edward 
               with 33rd Regiment. He does not know my 
               father's army attacks Fort William Henry. 

                         BOUGAINVILLE
               But by now Munro knows his couriers didn't 
               get through. He'll send another. 

                         MAGUA
               The Grey Hair will try. 

                         BOUGAINVILLE
               Four or five, including two women entered the 
               fort ... 

                         MAGUA
               The Grey Hair's children were under Magua's 
               knife but escaped. They'll be under it again. 

                         MONTCALM
               Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua? 

                         MAGUA
               When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat 
               his heart. Before he dies Magua will put his 
               children under the knife so the Grey Hair will 
               see his seed is wiped out forever. 

     Montcalm won't get a direct answer.

                         MONTCALM
               My sappeurs are advancing the trenches through 
               the night, now. You may have your opportunity 
               soon.

     INTERIOR SURGERY, ENTRANCE - PHELPS - NIGHT

     exhausted, sitting on a low stool, taking a breath.

                         HAWKEYE (O.S.)
                    She know what she's doin'? 

     Phelps looks up, then he looks over his shoulder at Cora. She's in a borrowed
      launderess dress/blouse ... She looks different. He's a little indignant.

                         PHELPS
               First assisted me in Austria when she was 
               fourteen. I would say she does ... 

     Her apron is stained. Hawkeye sees this may be her first time in the New World, but it's
     not her first military campaign. Still angered at Munro's dismissive response, he's
     nevertheless falling for Cora.

                         HAWKEYE
               She does not shy away from much ... 

                         PHELPS
                    (elsewhere) 
               What's that? 

                         HAWKEYE
               Nothin'. 

     Alice Munro has caught Hawkeye's attention. Outside the surgery where a casement
     meets a wall, she sits, withdrawn. A catatonic older woman in a fine dress sits next to
     her.

                         PHELPS (O.S.)
               Miss Cora? Gentleman looking for you. 

     HAWKEYE

     enters. Cora's sewing up Uncas.

                         CORA
                    (looks up) 
               Mr Poe? 

                         HAWKEYE
               Miss. 
                    (re: cotton) 
               May I? 

     Cora, curious, nods. Hawkeye cuts some pieces from her ruined and discarded dress
     that she now uses to bandage Uncas. We don't know why; neither does Cora.

                         HAWKEYE
                    (to Uncas) 
               You 'bout done holdin' hands with Miss Munro? 

     Uncas laughs, looking from her to Hawkeye. Then he's up and he hurts. Cora starts to
     tend another wounded man. As they start out, Hawkeye hesitates. Sensing it, Cora
     turns.

                         CORA
               What are you looking at, Mr. Poe? 

                         HAWKEYE
               Why, I am looking at you, Miss. 

     Cora measures the directness of Hawkeye's manner. It's not insolent, only unsettling.
     Feeling foolish; she turns. He leaves.

     Each rifle is within reach of Hawkeye's hand. Hawkeye is taking extra care loading
      Killdeer. He charges it once, then overloads the powder by a quarter charge.

                         UNCAS
               You told him about the raid?

               Tight weave. 

                         HAWKEYE
               Another forty yards? 


     Uncas nods. Hawkeye wets it to make a tighter gas seal and rams it home. The tighter
     fit requires more effort.

               Advance, Sergeant Major! 

                         SERGEANT MAJOR
               Sir!!! 
                    (to soldiers)
               Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!

     Drums. The rear rank walks through the first two ranks, who are priming and loading
     in perfect order to their Sergeant Major's commands. As the third rank becomes the
     first rank ...

                         SERGEANT MAJOR
               Shoulder arms! 
                    (slam)
               Present! 
                    (slam)

                         HEYWARD
               Fire!!! 

     CUT TO ...

     EXTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY - COURIER - NIGHT

     sprints for the trees during the diversion of Heyward's sally. 

     TWO HURONS

     materialize from nowhere and charge at him ... both are BLOWN off their feet by ... 

     EXTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY, CASEMENT - UNCAS & HAWKEYE

     now handed already-loaded, primed and cocked rifles while the four men behind them
     reload the two just fired. Hawkeye gestures ... 

     EXTERIOR HILLSIDE - THREE HALF-SAVAGE CANADIENS

     are running down the hill to intercept the courier. One fires ... 

     COURIER

     a near miss. 

     EXTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY - HAWKEYE

     FIRES. A half second later, Uncas FIRES. 

     EXTERIOR HILLSIDE

     One Canadien's falling through the trees as the second one's hit by Uncas' shot. 

     HAWKEYE

     reaches out his hand. Killdeer with the heavier load is slapped into it. Hawkeye aims.
     Looks away a second and comes back to the sight in deep concentration. The world
     goes silent ... 

     HAWKEYE'S POV: COURIER & CANADIEN

     pursuer are barely visible. Only patches appear momentarily between the trees. They're
     three hundred yards away: an impossible shot in 1757. 

     EXTERIOR FOREST - THE CANADIEN

     will intersect the courier. His arm is back with his tomahawk to throw ... 

     EXTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY - HAWKEYE

     judges wind, elevates the long rifle ... and FIRES at us. 

     JUMP CUT BACK: 

     TREES

     Hawkeye's heavy round rips through. We HEAR the ball cut air. A few leaves flutter ... 

     EXTERIOR FOREST - CANADIEN

     whacked head over heels by the impact. 

     COURIER

     looks over his shoulder. He didn't know the Canadien was there. He stumbles in the
     half light. Then he runs on ... 

     CUT TO ...

     EXTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY - WEST SALLY-PORT

     The three companies of the 62nd Regiment of Foot file back into the fort in perfect
     order. The sally-port is closed. Three men are wounded. The diversion worked
     perfectly. 

                         HEYWARD
               Sergeant Major! 

                         SERGEANT MAJOR
               Sir! 

                         HEYWARD
               Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men. 

                         SERGEANT MAJOR
               Atten-hut! 

     TROOPERS & MILITIA

     have seen no action for three days & nights. Heyward got their blood running and won
     their respect. They step aside and nod to him. Heyward keeps walking. He is home. 

     CUT TO ...

     INTERIOR MUNRO'S BEDCHAMBER - DOOR - NIGHT

     a knock and Heyward enters. 

     CORA & ALICE

     Alice is in her father's bed. Cora is collecting and tearing linen into strips for bandaging.

                         HEYWARD
               Cora ... I wanted to talk to you, but I'll 
               come back another time ... 

     Alice looks at the two of them and rises out of the bed.

                         CORA
               Alice ... 

                         ALICE
               Talk to Duncan, Cora ... I must manage ... 
               I cannot be an invalid schoolgirl. 
                    (starts
                    for door)
               I'll see if Mr. Phelps needs anything ... 

     She leaves.

                         HEYWARD
               I'm sorry, I didn't mean to ... 

                         CORA
               Her nerves are shattered. She's trying 
               to be brave. 

     There's a lot going on under Cora's surface. We don't know what it is, but it's
     disconcerting.

                         HEYWARD
               Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, 
               we will be the happiest couple in England ... 
               I am certain of that. More than ever before. 
                    (softens)
               I believe you must trust the judgment of others 
               who hold your welfare so close to their hearts ... 

                         CORA
               Duncan ... 
                    (pause)
               Duncan, I promised you an answer. You 
               have complimented me with your persistence 
               and patience ... But the decision I've come 
               to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes 
               than surrender my own judgment. 

     Heyward is stunned.

                         CORA
               And it's been unfair to you, while I search 
               myself for feelings, which, if they were
               there and as strong as they ought to be, 
               would've made themselves known long ago ...
                    (pause)
               Take my admiration and friendship, Duncan. 
               And please take this as my final answer. 
               It must be no. 

     Heyward' shattered inside.

                         HEYWARD
               I see ... 

                         CORA
               I am sorry, Duncan ... 

     Heyward nods. He's speechless. He's errect as he leaves the room. 

     CLOSE: CORA

     The tension rushes out of her and she shudders and leans against the quarter-timbered
     walls for support. Then she collects the linen and starts out. 

     CUT TO ...

     INTERIOR FORT, INNER CORRIDOR - CORA

     moving through the corridor past wounded. Two French mortar bombs explode above
     one of the casements. We hear shrill screams in the distance and ...  

                         HAWKEYE (O.S.)
               ... it was no raidin' party out for pillage. The 
               cabin was attacked by a war party. They are 
               sweeping south down the frontier spreading 
               terror among farms and Mohawk villages 'cos 
               all the men are here. 

                         IAN (O.S.)
               And my cabin's not thirteen miles south of 
               Cameron's! 

     Cora, passing the open door to Munro's crowded office, now hesitates. 

     CORA'S POV: THE ROOM

     Hawkeye, Captain Jack Winthrop, Ian, seven or eight other militia spokesmen, Munro,
     Heyward, two adjutants, one lieutenant of Rangers.

                         MUNRO
                    (to Jack)
               I must receive proof more conclusive than 
               Mr. Poe's opinion before I weaken our 
               defenses by allowing militia to withdraw. 

                         JACK
               Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken 
               together, that's gospel. Your fort will      stand 
               or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, 
               not these colonials' presence. 

                         MUNRO
               I judge military matters, Captain Winthrop, not 
               you. 

                         HAWKEYE
               That judgment is not more important than their 
               right under agreement with Webb to defend their 
               farms & families ... Major Heyward was at John 
               Cameron's. He saw what it was. 

                         MUNRO
                    (looking to Heyward for 
                    confirmation of his point of view) 
               What did you see, Major? 

     Heyward looks around the room. And he catches the doorway ... 

     CORA

     beyond the periphery of men, staring at him. 

     HEYWARD

     Munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British military interests.
     At the same time ... 

     CORA

     examines him with a cool, level stare. 

     HEYWARD

     looks at Munro. More French rounds detonate O.S. What if Webb gets here and they
     need to launch a counter-attack? They need every man they have. It's his moment of
     decision ...  

                         HEYWARD
                    (to Munro)
               I saw nothing that would lead me to the 
               conclusion it was other than a raid by savages 
               bent on thievery. 

     Jack Winthrop grabs Nathaniel.

                         HAWKEYE
               You're a liar! 

     CORA'S

     saddened. Heyward's stature has fallen irrevocably in her eyes. 

     HEYWARD

     can't help it. He turns to look at Cora ... 

     HEYWARD'S POV: DOORWAY

     She's gone. 

     HEYWARD

     suffused with an inner sadness, turns to Hawkeye.

                         HAWKEYE
               And the blood is on your hands! 

     Heyward reaches for his sword. 

                         MUNRO
                    (to Heyward) 
               I'll have none of that! 
                    (to colonials) 
               Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. 
               Not a butcher. 

                         HAWKEYE
               Easy for you to suppose. While it is their 
               women and children, not yours, alone in 
               their farms! 

                         MUNRO
                    (exploding)
               You forget yourself! 

                         JACK
               We are not forgettin' Webb's promise! 

                         MUNRO
               British promises are honored. And the militia 
               will not be released. Because I need more 
               definite proof than this man's word! 

                         JACK
               Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a 
               long time before you got here! 

                         MUNRO
               This interview's over! The militia stays! 

                         JACK
                    (to Munro) 
               Does the rule of English law no longer govern? 
               Has it been replaced by absolutism? 

     This is very dangerous talk.

                         HAWKEYE
               And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe 
               these people would do better makin' a peace 
               with the French! 

                         HEYWARD
               That is sedition! Treason! 

                         HAWKEYE
               That is the truth! 

                         HEYWARD
                    (restaining himself) 
               I ought to have you whipped from this fort! 

                         HAWKEYE
               Major! 
                    (changes down)
               Some day I think you and I are gonna have 
               a serious disagreement. 

                         MUNRO
                    (steel) 
               Anyone fomenting or advocating leaving 
               Fort William Henry will be hung for sedition. 
               Anyone leaving will be shot for desertion. 
                    (pause)
                My decision is final. Get out. 

     Hawkeye and the others are not intimidated. Their rage smolders. The look on
     Hawkeye's face says this is not over. 

     CUT TO ... 

     EXTERIOR FORT, PARADE GROUND - BONFIRE - NIGHT

     Sparks shower skyward. Impromptu music. Some Celtic proto-bluegrass played on
     fiddle & drums. It's stirring. 

     ANOTHER ANGLE: SOME WOMEN

     laundresses, dance from soldier to soldier - English foot and American Rangers. A few
     people lit by the firelight are solemn. Most are stirred to lift their morale for a while. 

     THEIR FACES

     underlit by the red firelight. They are a disposable people, a diverse plurality stuck in a
     postage stamp-size fort in an ocean of forest, locked into mortal deadly conflict
      because of the policies of cold and distant European monarchs. 

     A PLACE A LITTLE DISTANT FROM THE FIRE

     We can barely make out the eyes and faces of a number of men behind logs, crates and
     new wreckage from the day's bombardment. 

                         HAWKEYE
                    (low)
               ... got no kin in the settlements. If I did, 
               I'd be long gone. 

                         IAN
               You didn't think it right to be here in the 
               first place. 

                         HAWKEYE
               By my light that's how I saw it then and I 
               see it that way now ... 

                         IAN
                    (low)
               But we are under English military authority. 

                         JACK
                    (low) 
               I believe if they set aside their law as and when 
               they wish, their law no longer has rightful 
               authority over us. All they have over us is 
               tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer. 
               No force on earth will keep me here ... Anyone 
               caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each 
               man make your own decision ... Those who 
               are goin', be back here in an hour. 

                         HAWKEYE
               Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east 
               side of the swamp until you clear the French 
               picket line. Head north over the ridge, then 
               come about southeast and fork left in Little 
               Meadow and you're free of the outpost and 
               skirmishers ... 

                         A COLONIAL
                    (grumbles)
                Should've skinned outta this long ago. 

                         COLONIAL #2
               Got no families, Captain. Figured we'd stay 
               and give 'em a hand even though ... 

                         HAWKEYE
                    (to Colonial #2)
               I'll cover them from the top of the casement. 

                         JACK
                    (in amazement)
               You're not coming with us? 

     Hawkeye shakes his head. 

                         HAWKEYE
               Got a reason to stay. 

                         JACK
               That reason wear a blue dress and work 
               in the surgery? 

     Low laughter

                         HAWKEYE
                    (dry)
                It does and it is a better lookin' reason 
               than you, Jack Winthrop. 
                    (more laughs) 
               Push hard, 'cos you got to clear the French 
               outpost by dawn. 
                    (sticks out his hand and
                    grasps Winthrop's) 
               Good luck, Jack. 

     The men split up ... 

     CUT TO ... 

     FIRE - HAWKEYE

     wanders among the dancers and musicians clustered in groups, lit by the firelight.
      Someone catches his eye and he moves in that direction ... 

     HAWKEYE'S POV: CORA

     in the shadows, leaning against the wall, searching ... we sense she's been looking
     for him. He comes up to her. She turns in surprise. 

     CLOSER

     Somehow she breathes easier because he's there. She's in a white shirt with the sleeves
     rolled up. Hawkeye leads her away from some of the people. 

     CORA & HAWKEYE

     Hawkeye takes Cora's hand. Cora is awakening to a new spirit, a new wind blowing
     through a new land, a new self-determination ... She's drawn to this rough yet graceful
     man with his direct manner. Hawkeye settles against a wall. She leans next to him.
     Their shoulders touch. 

     CORA

     To her everything about him seems to be somehow right. She's discovered that the
     passions and outrage that move him, move her ... And her readiness to give herself to
     what stirs the deepest resonances of her soul is the same as his. 

     HAWKEYE

     looks at her. She's beautiful in the firelight. Cora's eyes find his and she folds into his
     arms. His lips find hers and tears stream down her face. She's suffused with an elation
     she can't explain. In the night before doomsday a romance is born in rebellion amid the
     huddled people in this small stockade ripped from the black earth of the forests of a
     wild continent. 

     CUT TO ...

     INTERIOR BARRACKS - LOW & WIDE - DAY

     door CRASHES inwards. Twelve British sentries storm in. Four bear torches. 

     REVERSE: HAWKEYE, UNCAS, CHINGACHGOOK, TWO COLONIALS &
     SOME MOHAWKS

     are out of the bunks and moving with them with tomahawks, knives, a flintlock ... 

                         SERGEANT (O.S.)
               You! Halt! 

     BRITISH SENTRIES

     their muskets aimed mostly at Hawkeye.

                         SERGEANT
               As you were!! 

     Hawkeye freezes. The others slow down, indecisive ... Hawkeye drops his tomahawk
     and says something in Mohican to restrain Chingachgook and Uncas. The British in the
     torchlight with the long muskets and bayonets are an image out of Goya. 

                         SERGEANT
               Take him! 

     Hawkeye's spun around and while his hands are bound. 

                         CHINGACHGOOK
                    (Mohican; subtitled)
               Why do they make my son prisoner? 

                         HAWKEYE
                    (Mohican; subtitled)
               I helped Winthrop and the others leave ... 
               This fight is not yours, father. I love 
               you and my brother. And you should leave 
               this place now and go to Can-tuck-ee ... 

                         CHINGACHGOOK
                    (Mohican; subtitled)
               What will they do with my white son? 

     One of the guards - scared to death by Chingachgook - nervously fingers his musket. 

                         GUARD
               Get back from him! 

     HEYWARD

     enters. 

     HAWKEYE

     shrugs in answer to Chingachgook's question. 

     HAWKEYE'S

     moved out. As he passes Heyward, his eyes lock on his. 

     CUT TO ...

     INTERIOR MUNRO'S QUARTERS - CORA - DAY

                         CORA
               He saved us! We are alive only because 
               of him ... 

     WIDEN:

     Heyward, Munro, Cora. We've entered mid-argument. An adjutant comes and goes.
     Heyward and Munro are sensitive to appearances in front of the adjutant. Cora couldn't
     give a damn. 

                         MUNRO
               The man encouraged the colonials to desert 
               in this very room, in my presence. He is 
               guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged 
               like any other criminal, regardless of what he 
               did for my children. 

                         CORA
               He knew the consequences. And he stayed. 
               Are those the actions of a criminal? 
               ... Duncan, do something. 

                         HEYWARD
               He knew the penalty for breaking regulations. 
               He ought to pay without sending you to beg. 

                         CORA
               You know he wouldn't send me ...! You 
               misrepresented what you saw and caused
               this. 
                    (frustrated)
               I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said ... 

                         MUNRO
               Not with enough certainty to outweigh British 
               interests in this fort. 

                         HEYWARD
               And who empowered these provincials to pass 
               judgment upon England's policies in her own 
               colonies? To come and go without so much as 
               a "by your leave." 

                         CORA
               They do not live their lives "by your leave." 
               ... They hack it out of the wilderness with 
               their own two hands, burying their dead and 
               their children along the way. 

                         HEYWARD
                    (distant)
                You are defending him because you've become 
               infatuated with him.

     Cora is having her intelligence written off as a hormone attack. She contains her fury. 

                         CORA
               Duncan, you are a man with a few admirable 
               qualities. But taken as a whole, I was wrong 
               to have thought so highly of you. 

     Heyward's shot through the heart.

                         MUNRO
               But the man is guilty of sedition and subject 
               to military justice and beyond pardon. 

                         CORA
               "Justice"? If that's "justice" ..., then the 
               sooner French guns blow the English army
               out of America, the better it will be for 
               these people. 

                         MUNRO
               You do not know what you are saying! 

                         CORA
                    (explodes)
               Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying. 
               And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of 
               sedition, too! 

     She exits, leaving them there. 

     CUT TO ...

     INTERIOR FORT, STOCKADE - NIGHT

     Heavy timbered door. A sentry. They stand at attention when Cora passes as opposed
     to barring her entry. 

     INTERIOR CELL - HAWKEYE

     comes to the door, grips the bars with his hands and looks at Cora. 

     THROUGH THE BARS TO CORA

     They are silent for a moment, then ... 

                         HAWKEYE
               Sorry ... can't ask you in. 

     Cora's pale smile. 

                         CORA
               They're going to hang you. 
                    (pause; soft)
               Why didn't you leave when you had the
               chance? 

                         HAWKEYE
               Because what I am interested in is right 
               here ... 

                         CORA
               What would you have me do? 

     He touches her hand. 

                         HAWKEYE
               Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not. 
               If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If 
               that happens, stay close to your father. 
               The French will protect the officer class 
               among the English. 

                         CORA
               No. I will find you. 

                         HAWKEYE
               Do not. 
                    (pause)
               Promise me. 

     Cora drops her forehead to Hawkeye's hands wrapped around the bars. She acquiesces,
     nods. Then HEAVY SHELLING commences. Cora & Hawkeye look up. Mortar
     bombs begin striking the fortress. Still dark. The final French bombardment has
     started. 

                         CORA
               The whole world's on fire, isn't it? 

     A pause.

                         HAWKEYE
               This part of it sure is ... 

     Reaching through the bars set in the thick door, their hands clasp each others. On that
     image ... 

     CUT TO ...

     EXTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY - VARIOUS CUTS - DAWN (2ND UNIT)

     French cannoneers in Batteries #1 and #2 fire again and again. They work like precision
     drill teams. 

     FRENCH TRENCH

     ending in Battery #3 is complete and surprisingly close to William Henry's walls. Crews
     reload the squat and massive newly arrived thirteen inch mortars. 

     MORTAR ONE

     The flash-hole is primed. The burning fuse is jammed into the bomb. The primer charge
     is lit off and the crew ducks as the crude iron belches red flame and black smoke into
     the lightening sky. The second mortar ROARS. Then a THIRD. 

     CUT TO ...

     INTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY - ENGLISH CANNON CREW - NIGHT

     tries to return fire but can't under the heavy French bombardment. The French mortar
     bomb arcs in and EXPLODES smoke, flame and shrapnel, wiping out most of the
     crew. The fortress is under the heaviest attack we've seen. Wounded are in shock or
     terrorized. Another mortar bomb arcs in and explodes part of a building and casement,
     starting a fire.
     Another lands in the grounds. People scatter. It doesn't explode. One soldier dashes to
     rip out the fuse. As his hand is inches away ... EXPLOSION. 

     CUT TO ...

     INTERIOR STOCKADE - HAWKEYE - DAWN - LATER

     protects Cora through the bars as she half sleeps through the muffled roar. Then the
     thundering stops. Hawkeye seperates himself from her and crosses to the window. 

     EXTERIOR FORT, MAIN GATE - HAWKEYES POV: CHEVALIER DE LEVIS

     bows deeply to Major Beams. A French honor guard of five men is behind him. A white
     scarf is on his sword tip. The fresh destruction of the fort is apparent. Debris smolders. 

     INTERIOR FORT - STOCKADE - HAWKEYE

     crosses to an awakened Cora. He touches her face. He's desperate to drill these next
     words into her brain. 

                         CORA
               What is it? 

                         HAWKEYE
               I don't know. Whatever happens you stay 
               with your father. You stay among the officers. 

     Cora looks up at Hawkeye. We feel forboding. O.S. are heard drums ... 

     CUT TO ...

     EXTERIOR FRENCH LINES - MUNRO, HEYWARD, BEAMS - DAY

     The drums are from Munro's honor guard. They stop. 

     REVERSE: FRENCH SOLDIERS

     Marquis de Montcalm, immaculate, backed by his guard of honor in white, grey and
     medium blue with six foot by eight foot regimental colors and the French flag (gold
     fleur-de-lis on a field of blue). 

     FACES

     They carried two hundred and forty-five bateaux across a ten mile portage, all their
     supplies and artillery, and then rowed down the length of Lake George to get here. To      them, assaulting this fort is the easy part. The drummers of the honor guard play a
     tattoo behind them. 

     INDIAN FACES

     Huron, Ottawa, Osage, Choctaw, Fox ... hear the drum of the honor guard and wait.
     They're in war paint. Many tattoos. Split ears. The Osage scalping locks are hennaed
     red. Canadiens among them are bearded, dirty, half savage ... At their head ... 

     MAGUA

     in full war paint, with a coterie of Huron warriors, silent, waiting. Drums. 

     INTERIOR FORT - ENGLISH TROOPS (TABLEAUX)

     grim, silent, watchful. 

     COLONIAL MILITIA & MOHAWK INDIANS IN WAR PAINT (TABLEAUX)

     watching the parlay from a blown apart battery. Silent. 

     WIDE: FRENCH & ENGLISH

     and their honor guards. Montcalm steps forward and sweeps his plumed hat to the
     ground in a courtly bow. Munro bows coldly. 

                         MONTCALM
               Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant 
               antagonist. I am happy to make your 
               acquaintance as a friend. 

                         MUNRO
               And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis. 

                         MONTCALM
               Please accept my compliments for the strong 
               and skillful defense of your fortress. Under 
               the command of a lesser man it would have 
               fallen long ago given the superior numbers and 
               material ... mere chance has allowed me to 
               array against you ... 

                         MUNRO
               Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a 
               diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason. 

                         MONTCALM
               You have already done everything which is 
               necessary for the honor of your Prince. I 
               will forever bear testimony that your resistance 
               has been gallant and was continued as long as 
               there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen 
               to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to 
               consider my terms for your surrender. 

                         MUNRO
               However I may apprise such testimony from 
               Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is 
               strong and stands. 

                         MONTCALM
               Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may 
               be refused obstinacy ... These hills afford to 
               us every opportunity to reconnoiter your 
               works and I am possibly as well acquainted 
               with your weak condition as you are yourselves. 

     Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British
     reinforcements arrive? 

                         MUNRO
               Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the 
               Hudson and he knows the size and imminence 
               of the army of Webb ...? 

     Montcalm takes a moment to reply and appears genuinely sympathetic to Munro. 

                         MONTCALM
                    (quietly)
               My scouts intercepted this dispatch intended 
               for you. 

     Munro is puzzled, suspicious. 

                         MONTCALM
                    (to Bougainville)
               Read the dispatch. 

     HEYWARD & MUNRO]

                         BOUGAINVILLE 
                    (O.S. - reading)
               "Colonel Munro - Fort William Henry. I have 
               no men available to send to your rescue. It is 
               impossible. I  advise you to seek terms for 
               surrender. Signed Webb." 

     Munro is rocked, as if struck by a blow. Bougainville hands Heyward the letter. 

                         HEYWARD
                    (confirming)
               This is the signature of Webb. 
                    (to Munro)
               And I know the temper of our men. Rather 
               than spend the war in a French prison hulk 
               in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end. 

                         MUNRO
                    (to Montcalm)
                You have heard your answer, Monsieur le 
               Marquis. 
                    (salutes) 

     Munro starts off. Montcalm stops him. 

                         MONTCALM
               Sir. 
                    (challengingly)
               I am incapable of mistreating brave men. 
               I beg you not to sign the death warrant 
               of so many until you have listened to my 
               terms. 

     Munro turns. 

                         MUNRO
               Such as ...? 

                         MONTCALM
               My master requires the fort be destroyed. 
               But, for you and your comrades, there is 
               no privilege that will be denied. None of 
               your men will see the inside of a prison
               barge. They're free to go so long as they 
               return to England and fight no more on this
               continent, and the civilian militia return to 
               their farms. 

                         MUNRO
               Their arms? 

                         MONTCALM
               They may leave the fortress fully armed, but 
               with no ammunition ... Other than that, ask 
               what you wish. 

     Munro's impressed with Montcalm's generosity. 

                         MUNRO
               The honors of war? 

                         MONTCALM
               Granted. 

                         MUNRO
               My colors? 

                         MONTCALM
               Carry them to England to your King with pride. 

                         MUNRO
               Allow me to consult with my officers. 

     As he turns away something's been disconnected inside Munro that can never get put
     back together. As the men move away from the French ... 

                         MUNRO
               I have lived to see two things I never expected. 
               An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And 
               a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage. 

                         HEYWARD
               General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back 
               and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our 
               mission is to fight. 

                         MUNRO
                    (flares)
               Death and honor are sometimes thought to be 
               the same. Today I have learned that they are not. 

     Munro looks at the fortress behind him. 

                         HEYWARD
               Sir! 

                         MUNRO
                    (stops him with his eyes)
               The decision is final. 

     A beat. Then Munro turns toward Montcalm. Their eyes meet across the churned,
     scarred earth of the battlefield. 

                         MUNRO
               I am deeply touched by such unusual and 
               unexpected generosity ... The fort is yours 
               under the condition that we be given until 
               dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and 
               women for their march and turn our wounded 
               over to your surgeon. 

                         MONTCALM
               Granted, Monsieur. 

     And Montcalm bows deeply and as he does so ... 

     CUT TO ...

     EXTERIOR FRENCH LINES - CLOAKED MAN - NIGHT

     passes away from the little city of tents in the direction of the beach and towards
     William Henry. He seems to head towards a vantage point from which to observe the
     fort. As he approaches a sentry: 

                         SENTRY
               Qui vive? 

                         MONTCALM

                         SENTRY
               Le mot d'ordre? 

                         MONTCALM
               La victoire. 

                         SENTRY
               C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, 
               monsieur! 

                         MONTCALM
               Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant. 

     The cloak parts. By the light of the moon the man's face is dimly perceived by us and
     the soldier as General Montcalm. The soldier snaps erect as Montcalm continues
     walking out beyond the line to a small stand of trees. 

     ANOTHER ANGLE: MONTCALM

     The moon is broken into pieces of light on the water and behind Montcalm; from the
     front of the stand of trees emerges a tall figure.

                         MAGUA
               Is the hatchet buried between the English 
               and my French father? 

                         MONTCALM
               Yes. 

                         MAGUA
               Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men 
               become friends. 

                         MONTCALM
               My master owns these lands and your father 
               has been ordered to drive off the English 
               squatters. They have consented to go. So 
               now he calls them enemies no longer. 

                         MAGUA
               Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood. 
               It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will 
               be buried. 

                         MONTCALM
               But so many suns have set since Le Renard 
               struck the war post. Is he not tired? 

                         MAGUA
               Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill. 
               It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, 
               they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell 
               all of their lands to enrich the European masters 
               who are always greedy for more than they need. 
                    (threatening)
               And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have 
               been many clouds and many mountains. But now
               he has come to lead his nation. 

                         MONTCALM
               That Le Renard has the power to lead his people 
               into the light, I know well. 

     Magua grabs the hand of the French commander. Imperceptible surprise in Montcalm's
     eyes. Magua jams Montcalm's fingers to his chest. 

                         MAGUA
               Does my father know that? 

     MAGUA'S CHEST

     A deep indentation and scar. 

                         MONTCALM
               That's where a lead bullet has torn you. 

                         MAGUA
               And this? 

     Magua turns his naked back to Montcalm and puts Montcalm's hand on his back ...      deep ridges of a scar a half inch wide.] 

                         MONTCALM
               My son has been sadly injured. Who did 
               this? 

                         MAGUA
                    (laughs; sardonic)
               Magua slept hard in the English wigwams. 
               And the sticks left their mark ... 
                    (pause; for real)
               Magua's village and lodges were burnt. 
               Magua's children were killed by the English. 
               Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks 
               who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife 
               believed he was dead and became the wife of 
               another. The Grey Hair was the father of all 
               this. 
                    (pause)
               In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk 
               to become free. In his heart he always was Huron. 
               And his heart will be whole again on the day 
               when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead! 

                         MONTCALM
               My son Magua's pain is my pain. 

                         MAGUA
               Does the chief of the Canadas believe the 
               English will keep the terms? 

                         MONTCALM
               Munro would. But General Webb will not
               send their soldiers across the salt lake. 
               Having let them go, I fear I will only fight 
               the same men again when I move south.
                    (pause; shrugs)
               And yet, I cannot break the terms of the 
               capitulation and sully the lilies of France ... 

     Long pause, wheels turn. Then: 

                         MAGUA
               Many things my French father cannot do, 
               Magua can. 

     Montcalm reacts as if he hadn't thought of that. 

                         MONTCALM
               As the English march away, our soldiers 
               and the Canadiens will be drawn to the 
               looting of the fort ... except for a small 
               guard ... 

     Magua abruptly leaves Montcalm. 

     CUT TO ...

     EXTERIOR WOODS - MAGUA - NIGHT

     walking back to the Huron camp. Reveal a Huron sub-chief has been in the woods,
     waiting for Magua. Now he joins him. They walk in silence. Then ...

                         MAGUA
                    (in Iroquois; re: Montcalm)
               I wonder at the blindness and pride of the 
               white man. He believes only he knows 
               how to speak falsely to make other men do 
               his bidding. 

     Magua exhales in derision. 

     CUT TO ...

     EXTERIOR FORT, MAIN GATE - MUNRO - DAY

     at the end of the column, rides out on his horse. Both sides of the gate are jammed with
     armed French troops standing at attention. The French colors and honor guard are just
     outside the gate along with Bougainville, Chevalier de Levis, both on horseback as 
     is - at the head - Montcalm. 

     CLOSER: MUNRO

     trots past his walking column out the gate. He does not look at the French. 

     MONTCALM

     salutes Munro and bows gravely from the saddle. 

     CLOSER: MUNRO

     salutes Montcalm.

                         MUNRO
                    (eyes forward)
               Monsieur, the fort is yours. 

     MID-COLUMN - ON HEYWARD

     marching with his 33rd Regiment of Foot well beyond the fort. The French troops have
     thinned out. Repressing shame, his backbone is rigid, his face is straight ahead. The
     33rd marches in perfect cadence to the drum. In the B.G. Munro on his horse passes
     Heyward as he rides towards the front of his column. Heyward does not look at him. 

     FRONT OF COLUMN - CORA WITH ALICE

     on the back of a mare. Alice, living through a wide-awake nightmare, is huddled under
     the arm of her sister. They ride behind the standard bearers. In the B.G. her father is
     seen approaching and takes his position at their side. Cora looks down the column,
     sheilding her eyes against the sun. We know who she's looking for ... Hawkeye. 

     CORA'S POV: THE COLUMN

     The 62nd and 42nd Highlanders including Heyward ... thirty to forty women and a
     number of children - for safety - in the middle, some frontiersmen, Ongewasgone and
     many Mohawk, walking wounded. The column is still snaking its way out of the fort.
     No Hawkeye. 

     CORA

     straining to see. 

     EXTERIOR FORT - PRISONERS

     being assembled, their hands shackled. Hawkeye is among twelve or thirteen. He stands
     erect, walking out of the gate. The French are starting to pour in to loot the interior.
     Hawkeye looks to his left about twenty paces in front of him and sees ... 

     UNCAS & CHINGACHGOOK

     on the other side of the column. Chingachgook cradles Killdeer as well as his own
     musket. They fall back to walk beside the prisoners on the other side of Hawkeye.
     Their eyes connect... We don't expect Hawkeye to stay shackled for the duration. 

     RANK AND FILE FRENCH

     A few insults. The British soldiers answer. Nobody breaks rank. It's just talk. 

     EXTERIOR ROAD - HAWKEYE

     His eyes sweep the column snaking its way into the v-shaped valley. The path cuts
     through the forested hills ahead. He sees ... 

     HAWKEYE'S DISTANT POV: CORA

     riding near the front where there are no more French soldiers. Only a few scattered and
     curious Huron and Ottawa. She does not see him. 

     PROFILE OF COLUMN - HIGH & WIDE

     as it passes left to right below like a long snake through the narrow valley. We're
     shooting from inside the dark woods. Lower, in the light, we see a scattering on both
     slopes of a couple of hundred Ottawa and Huron. They are in no order, are spread out
     and don't constitute a threat. They watch the column. 
     SLOWLY THE CAMERA ... slides across the shoulders and back of a large man
     wearing black plumes in his scalp-lock and other than a breechcloth is almost naked. He
     is heavily war-painted ... 

     FRONTAL - MAGUA

     and the left two-thirds of his face is painted red. The right third is painted black. Much
     silver is in his ears. His tomahawk is in his left hand. His cut-down musket in his right
     fist. Magua's attention is all focused to one point. 

     MAGUA'S LONG & TIGHT POV: MUNRO & CORA & ALICE

     at the head of the column. This is the focus of Magua's attention. 

     WIDE FRONTAL: COLUMN, STANDARD BEARERS & MUNROS

     Cora turns again to look for Hawkeye. 

     CLOSER: CORA

     doesn't see him, but something else has caught her eye. 

     YOUNG HURON

     running toward the column. Just one man. No musket. He's running and whooping like
     a dog charging from his master's front yard. Why? 

     CLOSER

     the Huron arrives at the column, his tomahawk swings into his hand and he brains a
     British trooper who falls dead. The single Huron never breaks stride. He simply runs off
     again ... 

     CORA

     horrified, holds Alice tighter. 

     MUNRO

     has seen it too. And now he sees ... 

     62ND REGIMENT OF FOOT

     fixing bayonets. A large sergeant unsheathes a two-handed claymore, facing the Hurons
     and other Indians ... 

     TROOPERS

     of the 33rd present arms. Did they violate the surrender by carrying ammunition? Locks
     are cocked. There's the answer. 

                         MUNRO
               Steady! No one fires! 

     EXTERIOR FORESTED HILLSIDES - OTHER TRIBES

     are watching what happens. 

     HEYWARD

     scanning them. 

                         HEYWARD
                    (to Sergeant Major)
               Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major! 

                         SERGEANT MAJOR
               Yes sir! 

     Drums beat the cadence.

     TROOPERS

     step over the fallen soldier. Heads turn, they're on edge ... 

     END OF COLUMN - HAWKEYE, UNCAS & CHINGACHGOOK

     watching. They exchange looks. This is not good. Chingachgook cocks both Killdeer
     and his own musket. 

     HAWKEYE'S POV: FORESTED SLOPES

     Hold. We start to make out details in the shadow. Tree trunks. We become accustomed
     to the dimness. Now in the lower light we see deeper in the forest. 

     CLOSER

     Many Huron and Ottawa are hidden in the shadows. They're moving along parallel to
     the column, stalking it. Waiting ... 

     ANOTHER BRAVE

     racing down the hill from the opposite flank towards the 62nd. 

     TWO SOLDIERS

     look at their sergeant. He nods. They wait until he's within ten feet of the column. Both
     bayonet the Indian. He's dead. 

     EXTERIOR HILLSIDES - HURON & OTTAWA

     saw what happened. But, they hold their ranks. 

     MOHAWKS

     among the British are slipping tomahawks into their hands, surreptitiously. Some are
     cocking flintlocks. 

     MUNRO

     gallops his horse away from Cora and Alice towards the scene of the last attack. We
     hear him from the distance ordering ...

                         MUNRO
               Do not break ranks! I want these ranks 
               to hold ...! 

     Cora's frightened.

     HAWKEYE'S

     frustrated. He saw Munro leave Cora. He knows events have a momentum and it's
     accelerating. 

     CHINGACHGOOK & UNCAS

     move next to the sergeant with the shackle keys who looks at them curiously as ... 

     WOMEN

     with children nervously search the threatening trees, hoping against hope these are
     isolated incidents. 

     HEYWARD

     draws his sword and is passing orders to his sergeant major, scanning the hills ... 

     EXTERIOR FORESTED SLOPE - MAGUA

     His eyes see Munro. 

     WIDER & LOWER: MAGUA

     raises his musket in his fist and emits a war whoop. WE NOW SEE ... hundreds have
     been stalking the column, hidden in the trees, maybe thousands. Then ... 

     WIDE: ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE

     FIRE from the trees crescendos within seconds revealing a spontaneous and massive
     ambush of mostly Hurons. They appear from behind every tree and it turns to a ROAR
     of musket fire, war whoops and screams as ... 

     SOLDIERS & CIVILIANS

     dropping like flies and seemingly thousands of Hurons attack down both slopes. 

     HAWKEYE

     is being unshackled by Uncas. The sergeant is rising from the ground where
     Chingachgook knocked him. Chingachgook throws Hawkeye Killdeer and Hawkeye
     shrugs into his pouch and powder horn as he races with Uncas for the head of the
     column ... 

     EXTERIOR FORESTED SLOPE - MAGUA

     charging down the hill ... with his coterie of twenty Huron warriors, heading for the
     area in which he saw Munro. 

     CORA & ALICE

     at the head of the disintegrating column. Cora's holding Alice's head to her bosom,
     covering her ears as if to protect her from the sounds. 

     HEYWARD

     shouting orders. 

                         SERGEANT MAJOR
               Right - about face! March! First rank present! 

                         HEYWARD
               Fire! 

     REVERSE:

     The volley knocks down fifteen of a horde of attacking Hurons. 

                         SERGEANT MAJOR
               Prime! Load! Second rank six paces forward! 
               Present! 

     Hurons are twenty yards away and closing.

                         HEYWARD
               Fire! 

     As the line of muskets belch smoke and fire ... 

     WIDE: THE HILLS & PATH

     We're shooting into the "v" of the valley with Hurons and other tribes pouring down
     from both sides. (IMPORTANT: the combined musket fire of Hurons, English and
     Mohawks generates tremendous clouds of smoke which obscure action, close off
     views, isolate pockets of combat into surreal tableaux that we'll move in and out of.

     BRITISH TROOPERS

     using their useless muskets as clubs or with fixed bayonets - as the smoke and fog
     swirls among the men - fighting for their lives ... 

     MAGUA

     glides through the scenes, striking and hunting. Some of his coterie of braves near him.
     He sees ... 

     BLONDE WOMAN

     hugging the ground in fear. Magua throws her over. It's not Alice Munro. It's a woman
     protecting her baby. Magua walks on. One of the braves behind Magua raise his
     tomahawk. On his downswing ... 

     HAWKEYE

     running through surreal patches, thinks he glimpses Cora two hundred yards away. 

                         HAWKEYE
               Cora! 

     Chingachgook, on Hawkeye's left, slams down two Hurons with his war club. 

     CORA & ALICE

     running through the chaos and murder and British troopers and Mohawks locked in
     struggle with Hurons. Cora's dress is torn. She holds Alice to her. There's a pistol in
     Cora's hand. 

     ONE HURON

     scalping a prone soldier, rips the trophy from his head, turns and faces us. 

     CORA

     shoots him in the face. 

     EXTREMELY CLOSE: ALICE

     and her eyes take it all in. And her affect starts to flatten. A blankness suffuses her
     expression and the girl withdraws from this reality into a deep dark cave inside her
     head. 

     HAWKEYE

     locked in combat. He tomahawks one Huron's arm with a slashing downstroke and
     comes right back into the face of the second with his backswing while his right hand
     fires Killdeer at ... 

     HURON

     six feet from Uncas and about to shoot him in the back. 

     HAWKEYE

     free for a moment, spins. He has no idea of direction any more. Everything is death in
     strange tableaux. Meanwhile: 

     MUNRO

     hollering

                         MUNRO
               Cora! Alice! 

     He cuts down a Huron with his sword who is trying to leap at him from the right. An
     Osage warrior with red scalp-lock leaps on the back of Munro's horse, reaching over to
     stab down into Munro's neck. The old man's left hand grabs the warrior's knife hand in
     an iron grip. His right hand pulls his horse pistol and under his upraised arm fires
     backward, point blank, blowing the Osage off the back of his horse. 

     WIDER

     Just then Munro's mount is shot. His horse rears up, throws Munro and falls on him. 

     HEYWARD

     shouting orders over the deafening noise.

                         HEYWARD
               Second rank fire! Six paces back! Prime! 
               Load! Third rank! Present! 

     A well-oiled, well-drilled fighting machine, but there are fewer of them. They're getting
     cut off. They close ranks automatically as a man drops. They're retreating in perfect
     order. 

     HURON WARRIOR

     about to strike a downwards blow is pushed aside by Magua. 

     CLOSER: MAGUA

     His eyes drop to what's in front of him. The field goes quiet. 

     OVER MAGUA'S SHOULDER: MUNRO

     his lower body is trapped under his dead horse. Magua leans in towards him. 

                         MAGUA
               Grey Hair. I will cut your heart from your 
               living chest in front of your eyes. As you die, 
               know that I will put under the knife your 
               children and wipe your seed from this earth 
               forever ... 

     Magua pulls his knife and as he leans down towards Munro ... 

     MOHAWK & HURON

     spin and flail furiously at each other with tomahawks and knives. The Huron goes down
     and then the Mohawk is shot. The Huron who shot him is cut down by a Ranger with
     tomahawk in one hand and bayonet in the other. Two Mohawks and three Rangers
     fighting back to back. They become an island swamped by Huron and Ottawa: amidst
     bodies and ground slippery with blood. As smoke obscures their image. 

     CORA & ALICE

     in a group of civilian militia. Two of the militiamen are shot down. The third engages a
     Fox warrior. Cora & Alice run. 

     MUNRO'S FACE

     frozen in agony by shock. 

     MAGUA

     reaching down and up into something, emerges and jams an object we barely see into
     the air. But his arm and shoulder and half his chest are splashed red with blood. 

     LONG SHOT: MAGUA

     seen from far away, holding aloft the heart of Munro. 

     REVERSE: HAWKEYE

     saw him and fights his way to attack when ... 

     WHITE HORSE

     crazed, CRASHES through men, knocking Hawkeye over ... 

     CHINGACHGOOK

     protecting Hawkeye, slams his war club into one Huron, breaking his attack, his arm
     and his skull and swings the other way burying the bladed end into the chest of an
     Ottawa who's behind him. Then ... 

     HAWKEYE'S

     up, looking wildly ... 

     CAMERA JAMS INTO CLEARING SMOKE:

     33rd Regiment of Foot and Heyward. They FIRE into our face. 

     CLOSER: HEYWARD

                         HEYWARD
               Six paces back! Prime! Load! Rank two, 
               present! Rank two, hold! 

     He grabs a partially loaded musket, the ramrod still in the barrel. They're taking fire.
     Men are dying. They're being pushed back. 

     AN ABNAKI

     wearing a large cross, attacks Heyward from the side. One-handed, Heyward fires the
     musket into the man's chest, sending the ramrod through him. Then Heyward's shot in
     the thigh and a thrown tomahawk hits him in the head and knocks him sideways.
     Dazed. Barely able to stand. He uses the musket as a cane and ...

                         HEYWARD
               Rank two, six paces back! Rank one, 
               present! 

     Rank two did not retreat six paces. They stand in confusion. Heyward looks to see
     what's wrong. 

     HEYWARD'S POV: THE REMNANTS OF THE 33RD REGIMENT OF FOOT

     are standing in water. They're up against Lake George. Their backs are to the wall. Last
     stand. Heyward straightens. 

     TWO FRENCH OFFICERS

     on horseback try to intercede in the slaughter of five women. One French officer is shot
     by a Huron. The other French officer runs through that Huron and shoots the second.
     Then his horse is shot out from under him and he goes down ... 

     JESUIT

     pleads with an Abnaki to give up a child he's holding by the legs in one hand. He offers
     his cross. The Abnaki throws the baby to the Jesuit, Pere Roubaud. 

     UNCAS

     sees a flash of something yellow. So does Hawkeye. They charge into the swirling
     chaos of attacking bodies. As we lose sight of them ... 

     ALICE

     on her hands and knees. A massive Ottawa pulls her upright by her hair about to take
     her life and her scalp. He's struck by a rock in the hands of Cora which barely phases
     him. He bats her aside and returns to Alice, when suddenly ... 

     OTTAWA WARRIOR

     is spun, punched and tomahawked into the ground by Hawkeye. Uncas has Alice and
     Cora ... 

     TWO RANGERS AND A MOHAWK WARRIOR

     from the earlier group are nearby. They combine with Hawkeye to fight their way out
      with bayonets and tomahawks. 

     HAWKEYE, UNCAS, CHINGACHGOOK, TWO RANGERS, A MOHAWK &
     MUNRO'S DAUGHTERS

     back through the swirling smoke. There seems to be a lull. Then they're hit from the
     side by musket fire. One of the Rangers is shot, the other wounded. Hurons attack. The
     Mohawk supports the wounded Ranger. 

     HAWKEYE

     shields Cora as they back up. 

     CHINGACHGOOK

     smashing his war club straight down on a Huron, reaches for the man's musket and
     shoots another. Then he sees ... 

     SMOKE DRIFTING OVER WATER

     It's glass-smooth. And the bows are barely visible of three or four Huron war canoes. 

     THE SHALLOWS - HAWKEYE, CHINGACHGOOK, UNCAS, CORA, ALICE,
     THE RANGER & THE MOHAWK

     back into the water. They're pursued by Ottawa and Hurons as they fight their way to
     the canoes. 

     CORA

     held up by Hawkeye, suddenly screams. 

     ANGLE

     something underwater is pulling her down. An Ottawa brave rockets out of the
     shallows. Before he's erect, Hawkeye slams him back into the water and FIRES. 

     WOUNDED RANGER

     has shoved a large birch canoe at them. 

     HAWKEYE

     Suddenly, the Mohawk fighting with them is shot and spins to face Hawkeye. His hands
     rest on Hawkeye's shoulders. Hawkeye looks into his face. Tries to hold him up, tries
     to rescue him. A frozen moment. Hawkeye's staring into his eyes and the man is staring
     into Hawkeye's as the light goes out ... Hawkeye lets him slide into the water and float
     away. He moves Cora and Alice towards the canoe ... 

     CUT TO ...

     EXTERIOR LAKE GEORGE - WATER & SWIRLING SMOKE - DAY

     The bottom of the frame is water like glass. Smoke obscures the background. Fingers
     tendril towards us. Out of the mist we HEAR small splashing and then the high bow of
     a war canoe defines itself. It's paddled towards us. 

     HAWKEYE, CHINGACHGOOK & UNCAS

     Cora's behind Hawkeye. Alice and the wounded Ranger are near Uncas. 

     CLOSER: HAWKEYE & CORA

     Cora looks left. Her eyes go wide. 

                         CORA
               No! 

     HAWKEYE

     spins. 

     HEYWARD & TWO TROOPERS OF THE 33RD IN A SECOND CANOE

     have emerged from the smoke ten feet from them. Heyward's aiming a horse pistol at
     Hawkeye. 

     HAWKEYE

     is non-plussed. He doesn't stop paddling. 

                         HAWKEYE
               You got nothin' better to do today on 
               Lake George than shoot me, Major,
               then go ahead ... 

     Heyward's a hair's breadth from firing. Suddenly they hear the boom of muskets and
     rounds come in. 

     WIDE

     They're being pursued by three boatloads - and then a fourth and fifth - of Huron. 

     HEYWARD

     is indifferent to Huron musket balls. Hawkeye hasn't stopped paddling and pays
     Heyward no heed.

                         CORA
               Stop it!! 

     Heyward comes to his senses. His head is gashed. A scarf, as a tourniquet, is tied
     around his leg. He lowers the gun. 

                         HEYWARD
               When you fall into British hands again, 
               Nathaniel Poe, I will have you hanged. 

     HURON CANOES

     paddle hard and deep and the canoes power across the lake. 

     HAWKEYE & HEYWARD'S CANOES

     with less paddlers, plus wounded, are slower and will be overtaken. 

     HAWKEYE

     looks to Uncas. They both realize the same thing. Hawkeye nods and he, Uncas &
     Chingachgook begin to paddle furiously. The others match the doubled pace. They're
     sprinting ahead but the effort is exhausting. 

     HURON CANOES

     maintain their steady pace. Three or four Hurons fire. 

     HAWKEYE'S CANOE

     Musket balls ricochet on the water's surface. One rips a hole through the bow.
     Hawkeye sees one of the Redcoats in Heyward's canoe is giving out ... 

                         REDCOAT #1
               Can't ... keep it up ... 

                         HAWKEYE
               Pull! 

     He renews the attack on the water with the paddle.

                         HEYWARD
                    (shouts)
               How long? 

                         HAWKEYE
                    (shouts)
               Only chance we got is ... 
                    (breathless)
                ... to get more distance on 'em and go 
               to ground! 

     Heyward digs in. Like firecrackers in the distance, Huron muskets sound. A new hail
     of musket balls cut the fabric of the canoes. One Redcoat is shot in the back. He falls
     overboard.

                         HAWKEYE
                    (shouts)
               Pull!!

     HAWKEYE CANOE

     sprints forward. 

     CLOSE: HAWKEYE

     looks over his shoulder. 

     THE HURON CANOES

     They're pulling away from them.

                         HAWKEYE
               Pull ...! 

     More Huron musket balls hit water nearby. 

     REDCOAT

     in Heyward's boat is shot. BUT ... the .65 caliber ball didn't penetrate his skin. The
     Redcoat - amazed - picks it off the floor of the canoe. 

                         REDCOAT #2
               Spent. 

     Distance caught up with eighteenth century ballistics. They're out of smoothbore
     musket range. 

     HAWKEYE CANOE]

                         HAWKEYE
                    (to Heyward)
               Head for ... for the white water. 

                         HEYWARD
               Do you hear me, sir! 
                    (exhausted)
               If you ever fall ... into British hands ...
                    (breathes)
               What white water? 

     HEYWARD & REDCOAT'S POV: LAKE

     divided by a spit of land. The right fork becomes a river with white water rapids. 

     HAWKEYE CANOE - HAWKEYE

     paddling now, too, as they furiously jam for the white water that will shoot them way
     ahead of the Hurons. 

     UNCAS

     leaps off the stern of Hawkeye's canoe and climbs up the stern of Heyward's and takes
     control. He roughly gestures to the Redcoat and the Major to stop paddling. He and
     Hawkeye will pilot the two canoes. 

     EXTERIOR WHITE WATER - WIDE - DAY

     The canoes enter the white water and they're so light, they're jet-propelled. 

     CANOE POV: EIGHT FOOT WAVE

     racing in the same direction they are. They hit it straight on and it shoots over them and
     they're drenched by two waves coming from the sides. 

     HAWKEYE & CHINGACHGOOK

     paddle like fiends to get momentum and control. 

     UNCAS' CANOE

     Same thing. When they crested the wave Uncas hollers at them to "pull" and they do.
     As soon as they're through it, Uncas slams the paddle in the water and makes the canoe
     revolve a hundred and eighty degrees in a vortex so that now it's going through 
     stern-first or the stern becomes the bow, so that Uncas could pilot it a different way
     through a hazard of ... 

     EXPOSED ROCKS

     jutting out of the water. 

     WIDE - BOTH CANOES

     Hawkeye didn't have to turn because Chingachgook, at the bow, uses his paddle to
     shove the canoe away from jutting rocks. Uncas does the same. Past the jutting rocks,
     Uncas swings it back around while ... 

     WHITE WATER

     smashes into the camera. 

     ALICE & CORA

     as the canoe roller-coasters and water bursts the bow. Then suddenly it's through and
     the water is miraculously smooth. 

     CANOES

     The Ranger, the Redcoats and even Heyward feel the exhilaration of the ride. That's
     because they think they're home free.

                         HAWKEYE
               Here's where it gets tricky ... 

     Heyward turns to look in front of him. He doesn't know what the hell Hawkeye's
     talking about. 

     HEYWARD'S POV: THE RIVER AHEAD

     looks glass-smoth. Although there is a distant ROAR of sorts. Then Heyward realizes:
     something's wrong with this picture. 

     CLOSER: HEYWARD

     The look on his face starts to change. 

     HEYWARD'S POV: TIGHTER

     The glass surface of the river continues to a line then falls off the end of the world. The
     river just ends ... 

     BOTH CANOES: HEYWARD, REDCOATS, THE RANGER

     realize they're heading for the lip of a waterfall. There's a couple of outcroppings of
     rock in the center at the very edge. We are at Glen Falls.

                         HAWKEYE
               Don't move ... 

     AERIAL SHOT

     from the other side of the falls. It's a two hundred foot high, death-defying cataract.
     The canoes - slightly above us - will go right over. 

     TWO CANOES

     At the last moment, Hawkeye & Uncas land both on either side of the larger rock
     outcropping. It is literally at the lip of the falls. 

     HEYWARD

     grabs a rock to anchor the bow of the canoe. He loses his grip. The canoe rockets for
     the edge. 

     UNCAS

     lurches sideways, grabs a tree root. He is the only link of the canoe to earth. The bow,
     with Heyward, is literally hanging over the edge. Uncas strains and pulls the canoe to
     the rock. He gestures to Heyward. 

     HEYWARD

     crawls forward and makes the island. Then the two Redcoats. Finally Uncas. The canoe
     rockets over the falls. Meanwhile ... 

     THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND

     Hawkeye has beached his canoe and is camouflaging it with driftwood and brush. As
     they clamber over the high pieces of broken limestone, we see Hawkeye is slipping into
     a crevice. He motions to Cora. Uncas carries the wounded Ranger. Heyward helps
     Alice ... 

     CUT TO ...

     INTERIOR GLEN FALLS CAVES - FISSURE - TWILIGHT

     The irregular opening of medium blue sky is obscured by the black silhouetted forms of
     Hawkeye, Cora and then the others entering.

                         HEYWARD
               Where do we go from here? 

                         HAWKEYE
               We don't. 

                         HEYWARD
               I don't understand! 

                         HAWKEYE
               This is it, as far as we can go ... If we're 
               lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have 
               come this way and must've beached our 
               canoes and headed cross land. If we're 
               very lucky, they'll figure we went over 
               the falls. 

                         HEYWARD
               Then what? 

                         HAWKEYE
               Then we take the south rim down the 
               mountain and it's 12 miles cross country 
               to Fort Edward. 

                         HEYWARD
               And if we're unlucky? 

                         HAWKEYE
               You will have to forego the pleasure of 
               hangin' me. 

     REVERSE: WIDE

     Hawkeye helps Cora; Heyward, the Ranger. Chingachgook carries Alice, down the
     rockface into a cave. We hear a distant ROAR reverberating off the walls. 

     ANOTHER ANGLE: THE WALLS

     are scooped out, bone-like hollows eroded by tumbling water. At an earlier time the
     formation was part of the falls. 

     HAWKEYE & CORA

     reach the irregular floor of the chamber. The ROAR is louder. 

     WIDEN TO REVEAL

     a curtain of falling water. They're behind the cataract, probably a third of the way down
     its height. Light through the water stikes them with a silver luminescence. They're
     exhausted. The others join them. They almost have to shout to be heard. 

     CHINGACHGOOK

     followed by Uncas, takes stock of their supplies. They check their powder. They have
     almost none. Uncas shares his with Hawkeye. The Redcoat's cartridge case is soaked,
     the paper cartridges a soggy mess. Heyward has none. The Ranger has two left. In
     Mohican, Chingachgook decides some things. Hawkeye and Uncas nod. Heyward
     approaches Hawkeye.

                         HEYWARD
               Any powder? 

                         HAWKEYE:
                    (crossing to Cora)
               Only one or two loads. 

     CORA

     is soaked to the bones. Hawkeye strips off his buckskin hunting shirt and wrings it out.
     Cora turns her back, strips off her white blouse and puts on the faster-drying chamois. 

                         CORA
               Are we safe? 

                         HAWKEYE
               Maybe ... 

                         CORA
               Our father? Did you see my father? 

     EXTREME CLOSE UP: HAWKEYE

     The look on his face tells it all 

                         CORA
               Tell me! 

     TWO SHOT

     Hawkeye takes Cora away from the group and turns her by her shoulders and whispers
     to her. We don't hear what he says. Cora drops to her knees and places her hands over
     her eyes and face like a little girl trying to make something bad go away. 

     HAWKEYE

     Leads her to a depression, his arm around her shoulders, her face covered and she cries
     softly into his shoulder. 

     EXTREME CLOSE UP: CORA

     says into Hawkeye's ear, after she looks O.S. ...

                         CORA
               Say nothing to Alice ...! 

     Hawkeye nods.

     ALICE

     stands in the chamber not far from the wall of water, fascinated with its shimmer. She's
     oblivious to all the events and everything going on around her ... 

     HEYWARD

     sees Cora & Hawkeye together and turns away. 

     GROUP

     Uncas watches Alice. The wounded Ranger has fallen asleep. The Redcoat is
     exhausted. Hawkeye & Cora against the wall. 

     CUT TO ... 

     EXTERIOR RIVER BANK - RIVER FALLS ARE IN MIST & RED SKY -
     TWILIGHT

     A landscape with mist rearlit by the red light of the sun that's already behind the
     mountains. The blues are turning purple and the greens are turning black and the white
     highlights of the foaming water are going rose. Reflecting the darkening sky, where the
     surface isn't broken, the water is fast-moving metal ... SUDDENLY: a shaved head and
     muscled back stands into the foreground. It moves down the shore away from camera.
     He's followed by other Huron warriors. They're two hundred yards away from Glen
     Falls island. 

     HURON

     looks at the island of rock & trees and tilts his head curiously ... 

     CUT TO ... 

     EXTERIOR FOREST ABOVE CANYON & FALLS - GREY WOLF - TWILIGHT

     watches the Hurons below make their way towards the edge of the falls. 

     OVER HIS SHOULDER: THREE MORE WOLVES

     join him, moving frenetically, uneasily ... The leader of the pack looks up & howls as
     his eyes go white reflecting the new moon. 

     INTERIOR GLEN FALLS CAVE - HAWKEYE -NIGHT

     hears the distant howl. He's now lit silver blue by the moonlight through the falling
     water. Hawkeye knows it means Hurons are out there. He exchanges worried glances
     with Uncas & Chingachgook. 

     UNCAS

     immediately starts up the right acclivity to one fissure, and Chingachgook moves
     carefully to the first fissure. Hawkeye follows. 

     HAWKEYE

     His countenance gives way momentarily. All his experience seems of no avail. He
     touches the side of Cora's face. Grabs Killdeer and follows Chingachgook. 

     ALICE

     sensing new danger, slips away on her own. 

     CORA

     crosses to the Ranger who's semi-conscious, feverish and getting delirious. She can't do
     a thing except hold his hand and think of her father. 

     CUT TO ... 

     INTERIOR SOUTH FISSURE - HAWKEYE & CHINGACHGOOK

     below the edge, listen & wait, testing the environment with all their senses ... 

     NORTH FISSURE - UNCAS

     against one wall, has his ear cocked, monitoring, facing away from the sky ... 

     ALICE

     looks at the sky through the fissure. She sees the starfields and feels silver moonlight
     pull her forward. She starts out onto the island, oblivious, unaware she'll expose them.
     Suddenly ... 

     UNCAS

     yanks her down next to him. He pulls her head into his chest, looking out over the
     edge, his tomahawk in front of him, his musket near his right hand. There is no sign she
     was seen. 

     UNCAS & ALICE

     He relaxes, looks at her and puts his finger to his lips telling her to be silent.
     Languorously, she lies back, closes her eyes and lays a hand on his shoulder, palm up,
     as if he were a prince in a romantic fantasy. Uncas tries to restrain her. 

     ALICE'S

     eyes slowly open. Oblivion disappears. It's replaced with escalating fear. She holds onto
     Uncas with desperation. Her fingers claw his shoulders. She buries her face in his
     chest. 

                         ALICE
               Uncas ... 

     Her body shudders. Her terror's total. He tries to restrain and calm her. She won't let
     him. Then her mouth seeks his and in the passion of despair and fear and wanting life,
     she holds him between her thighs. And Uncas is confused, but Alice whispers his name
     and he responds. He loves her in the half-light. 

     UNCAS

     his hand buried in her hair irradiated by the moon, then she seems to reach some
     emotional climax and begins to cry softly, and Uncas stops making love to her and
     holds her. Then she's flooded with shame. He reaches for her. She jerks away. He
     reaches for her again and clutches her to him. And she breaks down. Then he turns her
     face to him, but her expression has completely flattened. 

     WIDER ANGLE

     She's not a lover to Uncas now. She's pitiful & stricken and he comforts her. 

     CUT TO ... 

     EXTERIOR RIVER - MAGUA - NIGHT

     beaches a canoe on the bank. He and eight braves ease out. His war paint is fresh:
     green handprints on his chest and black and green on his face. Black plumes are affixed
     to his scalp-lock and his shawl is over his left shoulder. The right arm carrying his
     musket is exposed. Many scalps are tied to his tomahawk. He walks towards us
     approaching the island, two hundred yards away ... 

     CUT TO ... 

     INTERIOR SOUTH FISSURE - HAWKEYE - NIGHT

     checks his powder horn. Nearly empty. He looks at Chingachgook. 

     CUT TO ... 

     INTERIOR GLEN FALLS ISLAND, CAVE - CORA - NIGHT

     with the Ranger, looks up. Hawkeye enters. The look on his face. Then hers. They've
     been discovered. Now they're backed into a hole in the ground with no powder and no
     way out.

     CUT TO ... 

     INTERIOR GLEN FALLS, CAVE - HAWKEYE & CHINGACHGOOK - NIGHT

     Chingachgook talks to him in Mohican. Momentarily the anger and frustration is seen
     on Hawkeye's face. All his experience & craft has been to no avail. He looks at Cora.
     Back to Chingachgook. Chingachgook states something terse in Mohican. Hawkeye
     agrees. Heyward's confused. He doesn't know what they're talking about. Cora has
     understood Chingachgook's intent perfectly.

                         CORA
               Yes. Go ahead. 

                         HEYWARD
                    (explodes)
               What the bloody hell plan is this? 

                         HAWKEYE
                    (to Cora)
               In this there is a chance. If I live, I can 
               try to free you. If we don't go, there is 
               no powder, there's too many of them. 
               Though my heart would keep me here, 
               in that there is no chance. None. I can do 
               nothing. Do you understand? 

                         CORA
               Yes. I want you to go. 

                         HEYWARD
               Coward! Coward back at the fort. 
               Coward here. 

     Hawkeye uses discipline not to kill the man. 

                         CORA
               You try. With all you have. To save 
               yourself. If the worst happens, and 
               only one of us survives, something of

                If they don't kill you, they may take you 
               north up into Canada. A warrior may take 
               you for a wife.

     turns aside. Hawkeye insists.

     the attack as ... 

     HEYWARD

     puts Alice, who's entered, behind him as ... Uncas hits the floor of the cave. Now the
     first glow from Huron torches starts to light the walls. They're coming ... 

     CHINGACHGOOK

     has their weapons slung over his back. He says something in Mohican. Uncas spins
     looks at Alice: her expression's vacant. 

     HAWKEYE'S KNIFE

     cuts a lock of Cora's hair. He folds it into his shirt. The orange light from Huron
     torches, now closer, plays on the wall behind her. We hear many Huron approach. 

     CHINGACHGOOK & UNCAS

     now run out of the cave and throw themselves into the curtain of water. This is their
     exit. 

     HAWKEYE

     engraves her image in his memory one last time and then sprints across the floor
     towards the water ...

     and then through it into ...

     from the top and we fall down away from the world.

     surrounded. The women are behind him. He slashes at one Huron with his sword and is
     clubbed down by a giant. 

     MAGUA

     enters. His blanket, like a shawl, over his left shoulder, black plumes in his hair. He's
     imperturbable. 

     MAGUA'S HAND

     reaches out and touches Cora's hair. Cora is frozen to the spot. His hand drops away
     from the hated Munros and as Magua turns to go, he says something low in Huron and
     the two women are jerked towards the fissures. Heyward is dragged by the arms.

     appears exhausted by the fall and ride. 

     CHINGACHGOOK'S POV: WATER

     rocketing at us, battering and drowning us. We glimpse something downstream ... 

     CHINGACHGOOK

     tries to focus, slammed against rocks, he's striking out towards the right, swimming
     against the current. He's grabbing for something.

     and leather shoulder-strap. Chingachgook's hand grabs it. The current rushing past tries
     to steal him from Uncas and Hawkeye, who're also beaten, bloodied, exhausted. They
     pull the older, larger man from the water and ... 

     ON THE ROCK

     all three lie there, almost devoid of energy. Then Hawkeye rises, looks at the others.
     Chingachgook nods. He's up. Then Uncas, and they're moving off into the calm eddy
     between the rock they landed on and the shoreline.

     badly beaten, bound, staggers ahead to get behind Maqua. Then:

               If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers 
               ... will receive many gifts.

                    (as if considering)
               Gifts?

               Three, four oxen ... much wampum. 

                         MAGUA
               Wampum? 

                         HEYWARD
               Yes.

               Does Yengeese Major have property 
               across salt sea? 

                         HEYWARD
               Yes. 

                         MAGUA
               Yengeese Major give all property to Magua. 
               Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, 
               many gifts, maybe three, four oxen. 

     Magua looks at Heyward derisively. Does this white man think he's an idiot?

                         HEYWARD
               Gold could be arranged. 

                         MAGUA
               For Munro children? 

                         HEYWARD
               Yes. 

                         MAGUA
               How much gold has the master of the 
               Yengeese? 

                         HEYWARD
               The King? The King has mountains of 
               gold! 

     Long pause as if Magua and King George II were seriously considering this      transaction.

                         MAGUA
               Not enough. 

     Heyward is first realizing with whom he's playing.

                         HEYWARD
               What is enough? 

                         MAGUA
               Heart. Give Magua new heart.

     bay for some reason. We see Magua. He stands apart. They wait. Then ... 

     ANCIENT SACHEM

     is led to the dais by three women down the main street between the neat rows of birch
     bark lodges. Many scalps and trophies from the massacre are in evidence. He sits on the
     raised platform. He looks to be in his nineties. His dark wrinkled face is contrasted by
     his long white hair. His robe is painted in hieroglyphical representation of combat. He
     wears numerous silver & gold medals, gifts of French, English and Dutch governors.
     Most startling is his face. His dark & lined skin is enhanced by delicate lines of
     tatooing. He looks up to Magua. 

                         SACHEM
                    (in Huron; subtitled)
               The tomahawks of your young men have 
               been very red. 

                         MAGUA
                    (in Huron; subtitled)
               Many of the Yengeese are dead, great 
               Sachem. 
                    (sound dissolve to English)
               I have brought three of my prisoners, 
               to honor you. Two are the children
               of Munro. Whose scalp hangs on my 
               lodge pole. And whose heart I cut from 
               his chest. 

     Now we see Cora on the ground. Defeat & fear are held in place by her determination.
     Alice looks around, in another place. Heyward's hands are bound between his back with
     a piece of wood wedged through his elbows.

               And the Huron rich with the trophies of

               children of the white war chief - will burn 
               in our fires so all can share in this. 

     The sachem considers this. Then he looks up and sees something beyond Magua. 

     MAGUA

     senses the sachem's eye line ... 

     HAWKEYE

     unarmed, walking through the Hurons. A young boy rushes at him. Hawkeye, at the
     last possible second, dodges. Others catch and restrain the boy. The Hurons are
     astounded a European would simply walk into their camp. 

     CORA

     sees him enter, doesn't believe he's there. 

                         CORA
               Nathaniel! 

     Hawkeye glances at her, doesn't respond. The situation is a stick of dynamite ready to
     go off.
                         HAWKEYE
                    (to Heyward; low)
               Translate for me, Major. Into French. 
               Every word ... as I say it. 

     Magua starts towards Hawkeye, his tomahawk slipping into his hand.

                         HAWKEYE
                    (to Sachem)
               I come to you unarmed and in peace to 
               unstop your ears, wise one. Because the 
               Hurons are mislead by the words of the 
               wolf who's never spoken the truth.

     Sachem gestures with his hand to Magua. Magua reluctantly stops advancing on
     Hawkeye. Heyward's French translation has faded to a murmur. We hear Hawkeye's
     English.

                         HAWKEYE
               Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro 
               go free and take the fire out of the English 
               anger over the murder of their helpless ones. 

                         MAGUA
                    (to Sachem)
               Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the 
               Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron 
               do not fear English anger. 

                         HAWKEYE
                    (to Sachem)
               Wise one, the French fathers made peace 
               and swore to their honor not to break the 
               friendship. Magua broke it. It is false that 
               the French would not be friends, still, to 
               the Huron. 

     Sachem reacts.

                         MAGUA
                    (laughs)
               It made our French father happy to never 
               have to fight the same Yengeese again. 
               He told me this without telling me this. 

     Hawkeye realizes this is true.

                         HAWKEYE
               So the Huron are the servants of the French? 
               To do what the French are shamed to do? 

                         MAGUA
               No. 
                    (to Sachem)
               Huron serve no one. The French father 
               believes he fooled Magua because he is so 
               proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it 
               is the Huron path that Magua walks down, 
               not the French one ... Now, Les Francais, 
               also, fear Huron. That is good. When the 
               Huron is strong from their fear, we will make 
               the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we 
               will trade as the white man trades. Take land 
               from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk 
               & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over 
               other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong 
               as the whites. 

     Hawkeye appears to be losing his debate with Magua.

                         HAWKEYE
                    (to Sachem)
               Magua would use the ways of Les Francais 
               and the Yengeese ... 

                         MAGUA
                    (to Sachem)
               The red man put down the bow, picked up 
               the fire stick and became the best warrior 
               in the forest. Yes. It is the only way. 

                         HAWKEYE
               Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers 
               foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell 
               them for gold to the white man? Would the 
               Huron have greed for more land than a man 
               can use? Like Francais Black Robes do? 
               Would Huron kill tribes with disease? Would 
               the Huron fool Seneca into taking all the 
               animals in the forest for beads & brandy? But 
               sell the fur to the white man for gold? ... 
                    (to Sachem)
                Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les 
               Francais masters. Are they the ways of Huron 
               men who hunt & work the land? Or of dogs? 
               ... Magua's heart is twisted. He would make 
               himself into what twisted him. A Dog, become 
               Master of Dogs. But are Hurons dogs? 
               ... Magua's way is false. It is like the white 
               sickness. Magua's way will bring only sadness 
               and shame. Is there another way? I don't know. 
                    (pauses)
               I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese; Hawkeye, 
               adopted son of Chingachgook, of the Mohican 
               people ... Let the children of the dead Munro go 
               free ... I speak the truth. 

     Magua starts to rebut. Sachem holds up his hand and stops him. Nobody talks. Sachem
     whispers to the older men on either side of him. 

     MAGUA

     waits for the decision. 

     CORA

     looks to Alice, then to Hawkeye. 

     HAWKEYE

     exchanges a desperate look with Cora and then senses the Sachem is staring at him
     from the perspective of nearly a century of laws & judgments. Then ... to every word. 

                         SACHEM
               The white man comes like a day that has 
               passed. And night enters our future with 
               him ... 
                    (pause)
               Our council talks since I was a boy: 
               What is the Huron to do? 
                    (pause)
               But Magua would lead Huron down paths 
               that make us not Hurons.

               Dark girl burn in fire to heal the twisted 
               heart of Magua. 

     Cora, hearing the sentence ... Hawkeye's losing her.

                         SACHEM
                    (continuing)
               Munro daughter with moon in her hair 
               must be Magua's wife so Munro's seed 
               doesn't die. 

     Alice is gone, living in some dark recess of her mind.

                         SACHEM
                    (continuing; dissolves 
                    back to French)
                ... and Yengeese officer not go to Les
               Francais, but back to Yengeese so their 
               hatred burns less bright. La Longue Carabine, 
               go in peace. 

     People move, start to implement the sentence. Hawkeye's panicked. Cora is jerked
     upright. She looks at Hawkeye in terror: Sachem is starting to depart.

                         HAWKEYE
               No! listen. 
                    (to Heyward)
               Tell him I'll trade him! Me for her! Tell him!! 

     Heyward translates into rapid-fire French. 

                         HAWKEYE
                    (shouts)
               I am La Longue Carabine! My death is a 
               great honor to the Huron. Take me! 

     Cora is jerked forward by three Hurons. Magua grabs Alice. Cora strikes at Magua. He
     knocks her aside. Chaos & confusion. Meanwhile: 

                         MAGUA
                    (French; subtitled)
               This is not the voice of wisdom. I go to 
               the Hurons of the Lakes! You are women. 
               Send your arrows and guns to the Seneca, 
               beg from them venison to eat, corn to grind. 
               Slaves, dogs, rabbits, thieves ... I spit on you! 

     Those Hurons who hear, do so in deadly, boding silence. Magua and his fourteen hard
     core braves start out as ... 

     SACHEM

     heard Heyward's translation. He looks at Heyward, then looks at Hawkeye and he nods
     his head. 

     HAWKEYE

     sees this. His eyes go to Cora. They've stopped dragging her towards the fire pit.
     Hawkeye steps forward to surrender. Cora is thrown at him. Cora looks around wildly.
     Instead of taking Hawkeye, two warriors grab Heyward. 

     HEYWARD

     is immediately hamstrung and his legs collapse. He gasps. He's caught under the arms
     and dragged forward.

                         HAWKEYE
               I said to trade me! 

     Hawkeye's holding Cora. Heyward struggles to be seen.

                         HEYWARD
               ... compliments, Mr. Poe. 
                    (pause)
               Take her and get out. 

                         CORA
                    (standing)
               What are they doing to Duncan? 
               Duncan! 

     He's gone. They start to ease away from the mass of Hurons.

                         HAWKEYE 
                    (low to himself)
               And my compliments to you ... 

                         CORA
               Alice? 

     Hawkeye's concentration is on backing out of the Huron mob. Will the Sachem's
     judgment be honored? Will some warriors hack down Hawkeye & Cora? As they go ... 

     CORA

     moves towards her sister. But Hawkeye holds her tightly as they retreat. 

     CORA'S POV: ALICE

     with Magua's group crosses the path. He drags Alice behind him like baggage. She
     regains her feet. Magua is oblivious to her. He's heading towards the plateau. 

     CUT TO ... 

     EXTERIOR FOREST, TREE LINE - CHINGACHGOOK & UNCAS - DAY

     Uncas sees Magua's direction. Uncas touches his father, grabs his musket and races off.
     Chingachgook reaches to stop him, but he's too late. Chingachgook's hand in the air ... 

     TWO-SHOT: HAWKEYE & CORA

     near the tree line. Hawkeye has eyes only for ... 

     HAWKEYE'S POV: HURONS

     moving towards fire pit. One turns to watch Hawkeye & Cora depart. Will he arouse
     others to attack? Behind him, others are doing something to Heyward and flames leap
     up. 

     CORA'S EYES

     are on Alice, off to the right in the meadow. 

     HAWKEYE

     tense. They're almost there. 

     CHINGACHGOOK

     holding Killdeer. 

     CHINGACHGOOK'S POV: MASSED HURON

     Sky & flames. Suddenly, Heyward's stood upright into the fire, bound to a bracket by
     his arms. As the flames start devouring him ... 

     HAWKEYE & CORA

     close to Chingachgook and the tree line ... 

     CHINGACHGOOK

     tosses Hawkeye Killdeer. As fast as he jams it into his shoulder he FIRES. 

     HEYWARD

     among the hollering Hurons, is shot dead. It goes unnoticed. 

     CUT TO ...

     EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - UNCAS - DAY

     half-way up the rock face. He's approaching an overhang. He climbs with a reckless
     desperation ... 

     EXTERIOR STREAM - HAWKEYE & CHINGACHGOOK

     pound across the (sic) to the meadow towards Magua's path ... 

     CORA

     trying to stay with them, scrambles up ... 

     EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - UNCAS

     reaches the overhang. It juts away from the face six feet. 

     THE CEILING OF THE OVERHANG

     Uncas' hand jams into a crack in the granite, forms a fist and twists, making a wedge.
     He swings out, dangling in space by the hand wedged into the rock. His right hand
     reaches out and up, searching the vertical face for ... 

     UNCAS' HAND

     ... a rock flake. An indentation. Anything ... His fingers find a diagonal crevice and ... 

     UNCAS

     swings out, now hanging by the vertical face above the overhang. His features are
     distorted with determination. Nothing will stop him. His right hand grabs another rock.
     His arms snap him up. Then push. He's on the ledge. Moving fast ... 

     CUT TO ... 

     EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - HURONS - DAY

     on point are approaching the path above the promontory. Five warriors are ahead of
     Magua. One behind him drags Alice. 

     FIRST

     Huron starts up the narrow path. Suddenly ... 

     UNCAS

     slams him off the rock with the butt of his musket. 

     WIDE ANGLE

     Two's musket coming up. Uncas swings. FIRES. Before he's fallen, Uncas bayonets
     Three. 

     FOURTH

     FIRES, misses, swings. Uncas slips the swung musket, but it catches his elbow. Uncas'
     musket falls. Before it hits the ground his tomahawk is out and hacks Four over the
     edge ... 

     MAGUA

     running forward past Five, confronts Uncas head on. It's incredibly fast. 

     UNCAS'

     three tomahawk swings are dodged by Magua whose own knife streaks like silver
     flashes. Uncas, gashed on arms and chest, feints right and slams Magua with an open
     hand, closes and the men are intertwined steel and muscle ... and Magua throws Uncas.
     Going with him and rolling off Uncas, Magua's knife flashes into his armpit. Uncas'
     right arm is useless. He scrambles up. Next to the expertise of a mature warrior like
     Magua, Uncas' raw, young determination may not be enough. 

     EXTERIOR - MEADOW - CHINGACHGOOK

     freezes. 

     EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - UNCAS

     closing, swings. Magua moves inside, stabs Uncas twice, turns him to face the edge,
     ripping his head left to expose the right underside of his throat. 

     CLOSE: MAGUA'S

     knife arm punches forward. 

     WIDE: PROMONTORY

     Uncas falls down the face onto to the rocks. 

     CHINGACHGOOK

     seeing his boy killed, CRIES out and is charging up the path, Hawkeye following. 

     EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - ALICE

     backs to the edge. 

     MAGUA

     moves on Alice. His knife is low, about to strike. She stares at him. Her eyes are like
     pools of deep water, calm, open, almost beatific. It stops Magua ... 

     MAGUA

     inexplicably, drops his knife hand. He's riveted by her. About him, there's a glimmer of
     something else. He wears a human face for this one moment. He reaches out with his
     other hand to offer her safety. To bring her back from the edge ... 

     ALICE

     looks down at Uncas, her lover, dead on the rocks below. She turns to Magua with
     enigmatic calm. Her eyes seem to see into him. She steps off the edge. She falls to her
     death next to Uncas ... 

     EXTERIOR MEADOW - CORA

     collapses to her knees on the ground and her face falls forward into her hands ... 

     HURON WARRIORS

     are running down the path to intercept Chingachgook, charging uphill, fueled by a
     father's rage, and Hawkeye. One Huron aims at the center of Chingachgook's chest ... 

     HAWKEYE

     FIRES past his father's side. The Huron's blown off the path. Hawkeye races to reload
     on the run ... 

     EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - MAGUA

     sees the approach of Chingachgook. 

     TO CHINGACHGOOK

     Huron warriors are an irrelevance. He slams one aside with his musket. 

     HAWKEYE FIRES. 

     HURON

     with tomahawk, about to blindside Chingachgook, is SHOT DOWN. 

     MAGUA

     charging Chingachgook. 

     VERY WIDE

     Two men, like dots, race to collide at the center of the promontory. Now the others fall
     back... It's one-on-one. Hawkeye slows ... 

     COMBATANTS

     Magua - confident, pumped up - feints with his left, his tomahawk appearing in his
     right, sweeping backhand, while his left, magically holding his blade, is jamming up to
     gut Chingachgook. Chingachgook's dead. Except ... 

     CHINGACHGOOK

     isn't there. He rolled and, on one knee with his back to Magua, his arm slams rearward.
     The massive war club crashes into Magua's back. 

     MAGUA

     stunned, turns to hatchet Chingachgook ... 

     CHINGACHGOOK

     now up and towering - slams his club right into Magua's assault ... destroying it,
      breaking Magua's right arm. And ... 

     CHINGACHGOOK

     ... with his momentum, spins like a shot-putter and the next blow cripples Magua's left
     side and crushes part of his chest. 

     ANOTHER BLOW

     destroys Magua's collar and shoulder. 

     MAGUA

     amazed. His body is broken and crippled, but he still stands. He looks into the eyes of
     the last warrior of the Mohicans. 

                         CHINGACHGOOK
               UNCAS!!! 

     And he spins and swings. The blade side of the war club punches into Magua's chest,
     caving him in two. 

     WIDE

     Magua dies in the dust. 

     HAWKEYE

     watching Chingachgook's heaving back. It's over. 

     CORA

     alone, kneeling in the meadow. Her eyes downcast ... 

     FADE OUT ...

     FADE IN 

     EXTERIOR - MOUNTAIN TOP - WIDE REAR SHOT - NEXT DAY

     Chingachgook's at the edge, facing the endless rolling forests to the west. A haze of
     sunlight illuminates silver and lead clouds. Hawkeye is a little apart, watching his father. 

     HAWKEYE'S POV: CHINGACHGOOK

     speaks to the sky.

                         CHINGACHGOOK
                    (Mohican)
               Great Spirit and the Maker of all Life ... 

     ON HAWKEYE & CHINGACHGOOK

     We HEAR Hawkeye's English translation in VOICE OVER: 

                         CHINGACHGOOK/
                         HAWKEYE (V.O.): 
                    (in English)
               ... a warrior goes to you swift and straight 
               as an arrow shot into the sun. Welcome him 
               and let him take his place at the council fire 
               of my people. 
                    (pause)
               He is Uncas, my son. 
                    (pause)
               Bid them patience and ask death for speed; 
               for they are all there but one
               - I, Chingachgook - Last of the Mohicans. 

     Chingachgook's hands drop to his sides. He lets out his breath with a weariness. His
     eyes seek Hawkeye's. They hold ... 

     CORA

     is standing, her back to us, in front of a rock-covered grave with a wooden cross. Next
     to it is Uncas' burial platform. Cora [says a] silent prayer. Then she pauses, crosses
     herself. Her emotions are spent. She moves next to Hawkeye. He takes her hand. 

     HAWKEYE & CORA]

                         HAWKEYE
               Will you go back to England? 

                         CORA
               I have nothing to go back for. 

     Long pause. 

                         HAWKEYE
               Then will you stay in America? 

     She turns to face him.

                         HAWKEYE
               And will you be my wife? 

     Pause. 

                         CORA
               Yes. 

     They hold each other's eyes. She searches his face.

                         CORA
               Where will we go? 

                         HAWKEYE
               Winter with the Delaware, my father's 
               cousins. And in the spring, cross the 
               Ohio and look for land to settle with my 
               father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee. 

     They move next to Chingachgook. He senses they're beside him. Hawkeye's arm is
     around her shoulders.

                         CHINGACHGOOK
               The frontier moves with the sun and pushes 
               the red man of the wilderness forests in front 
               of it. Until one day there will be nowhere left. 
               Then our race will be no more, or be not us ... 
               The frontier place is for people like my white 
               son and his woman and their children. 

                         HAWKEYE
               That's my father's sadness talking. 

     Hawkeye puts a hand on his shoulder.

                         CHINGACHGOOK
               No. It is true ... One day ... there will be no 
               more frontier. Then men like you will go, too. 
               Like the Mohicans. 
                    (pause)
               And new people will come. Work. Struggle 
               to make their light ... One mystery remains. 

                         HAWKEYE
               What is that? 

     Cora, listening to Chingachgook, takes Hawkeye's hand. 

                         CHINGACHGOOK
               Will there be anything left to show the world 
               that we ever did exist? 

     REAR SHOT

     Cora stands next to her man. Hawkeye puts his arm around his father. They stare out
     over the wilderness. 




                         THE END
