               EXTERIOR  STREETS OUTSIDE RAILWAY TERMINAL  DAY

               The film opens with crowds of girls, shot in a sequence of 
               CLOSE-UPS, chasing after GEORGE, JOHN and RINGO. The boys 
               hare off just ahead of them. They take a turn down a back 
               alley way and the crowds of screaming girls are after them.

               EXTERIOR  TERMINAL

               They rush on through the narrow cobbled passageway and into 
               the main station, quickly show their tickets at the barrier 
               for the London train, and get onto the platform as hordes of 
               yelling and screaming girls reach the closed gates.

               EXTERIOR  TERMINAL PLATFORM

               We see the fans rushing to the few platform ticket machines, 
               and endless pennies being dropped and tickets torn out in 
               their haste to get onto the platform to see the boys.

               NORM has been waiting for the boys and he hurries them to 
               where all their baggage, instruments and the drums are 
               waiting, piled up to be put into the guards' van. The boys 
               turn and see the oncoming stream of girls pushing through 
               the barriers and descending on them with yells and shouts. 
               They grab their instruments, RINGO makes for the drums.

               NORM plugs into a handy transformer and using their 
               instruments like a gun volley to stop the onrush of females, 
               the boys blast fire into a number and start to sing. This 
               stops the girls in their tracks and they settle down on 
               whatever they can to listen to them playing.

               As the boys are playing, we CUT BACK into the crowds. In the 
               centre we see PAUL struggling and pulling to fight his way 
               through the girls to join the other boys. He is dragging a 
               very reluctant old man behind him. The old man seems most 
               disgruntled and we can see by his gestures how unwilling he 
               is to be pulled and pushed forward through all the girls.

               At last PAUL reaches the other boys. He sits the old man 
               down on a pile of cases and joins in the number to the squeals 
               of delight from the fans. The old man sits aloof and proud 
               ignoring the whole proceedings.

               JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO look enquiringly at PAUL who gives a 
               noncommittal shrug of the shoulders as if to say, "it's not 
               my fault" and the number proceeds.

               SHOT of sudden horror on JOHN's face. PAUL follows his eye 
               line only to see the old man has doffed his cap and is busily 
               collecting money from a disconcerted crowd. PAUL dives hastily 
               into the crowd, and with suitable apologies extracts the old 
               man and with a long suffering sigh drags him back to the 
               group. GEORGE and PAUL hold him firmly as they finish the 
               number, the old man standing there between them.

               As the number finishes and the girls scream and shout with 
               delight, the guard blows his whistle. NORM and SHAKE grab 
               the instruments and the drums, and with the rest piles the 
               lot into the guards' van. The BOYS head into their reserved 
               compartment pursued by the fans but the train moves off. 
               They have successfully repelled all extra boarders.

               THE BOYS stand and wave to the fans until out of sight line... 
               the girls running along to the end of the platform waving 
               and calling out.

               INTERIOR  RESERVED COMPARTMENT IN THE TRAIN

               The boys relax, sitting down on one side of the compartment. 
               They are about to settle down and make themselves at home 
               when first RINGO nudges GEORGE who in turn nudges JOHN. 
               Opposite them is sitting the LITTLE OLD MAN. He is holding 
               himself stiff, erect and very aloof.

               The three boys look at him enquiringly but with an elaborate 
               sniff he looks away from them and out of the window.

               PAUL catches his eye and winks at the LITTLE OLD MAN. He 
               winks back at PAUL, scowls at the other three then looks 
               firmly out of the window again.

               The boys turn on PAUL crowding around him.

                                     JOHN
                         Eh... pardon me for asking but who's 
                         that little old man?

                                     PAUL
                         What little old man?

                                     JOHN
                              (pointing)
                         That little old man.

                                     PAUL
                         Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.

                                     GEORGE
                         That's not your Grandfather.

                                     PAUL
                         It is, y'know.

                                     GEORGE
                         But your Grandfather lives in your 
                         house. I've seen him.

                                     PAUL
                         Oh, that's me other Grandfather, but 
                         this one's me Grandfather and all.

                                     JOHN
                         How d'you reckon that one out?

                                     PAUL
                         Well... everyone's entitled to two, 
                         aren't they, and this is me other 
                         one.

                                     JOHN
                              (long suffering)
                         Well we know that but what's he doing 
                         here?

                                     PAUL
                         Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud 
                         do him good.

                                     RINGO
                         How's that?

                                     PAUL
                         Oh... he's nursing a broken heart.

               The lads all look intently at the GRANDFATHER.

                                     JOHN
                         Aah... the poor old thing.

               He leans across to GRANDFATHER.

                                     JOHN
                         Eh, Mister... are you nursing a broken 
                         heart then?

               The GRANDFATHER nods soulfully glares at him, in a way that 
               indicates yes.

                                     PAUL
                              (whispering)
                         You see, he was going to get married 
                         but she threw him over for a butcher.

                                     GEORGE
                         A butcher?

                                     PAUL
                         Yeah, she was fickle.

                                     JOHN
                         Aye and fond of fresh meat and all.

                                     PAUL
                              (seriously)
                         No... it was his sweetbreads. She 
                         was dead kinky for sweetbreads. 
                         Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud 
                         give him a change of scenery, like.

                                     JOHN
                         Oh, I see.

               He inspects GRANDFATHER carefully.

                                     JOHN
                              (to PAUL)
                         Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?

                                     PAUL
                         Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.

               They all agree with PAUL.

               JOHN has been examining GRANDFATHER. He now leans forward to 
               him.

                                     JOHN
                              (in an over-friendly 
                              voice)
                         Hello, Grandfather!

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Hello.

                                     JOHN
                              (delightedly)
                         He can talk then?

                                     PAUL
                              (indignantly)
                         Course he can talk. He's a human 
                         being, like. Isn't he?

                                     RINGO
                              (grinning)
                         Well... if he's your Grandfather, 
                         who knows?

               The lads all laugh.

                                     JOHN
                         And we're looking after him, are we?

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         I'll look after meself.

                                     PAUL
                         Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!

                                     JOHN
                         He's got you worried, then?

                                     PAUL
                         Him, he costs you a fortune in breach 
                         of promise cases. He's a villain and 
                         a right mixer as well.

                                     GEORGE
                              (disbelieving)
                         Gerron.

                                     PAUL
                         No, straight up.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         The lad's given you the simple truth. 
                         I'm cursed wid irresistible charm, 
                         I'm too attractive to be let loose.

               At this moment, SHAKE, a tall man who works with the BOYS, 
               pulls open the door of the compartment.

                                     SHAKE
                         You got on all right then?

                                     BOYS
                         Hi, Shake.

                                     SHAKE
                         We're here. Norm'll be along in a 
                         mo' with the tickets.

               He sees GRANDFATHER.

                                     SHAKE
                         Morning!
                              (whispers)
                         Who's that little old man?

                                     GEORGE
                         It's Paul's grandfather.

                                     SHAKE
                         Oh aye, but I thought...

                                     JOHN
                              (cutting in)
                         No, that's his other one.

                                     SHAKE
                         That's all right then.

                                     JOHN
                              (displaying Grandfather)
                         Clean though, isn't he?

                                     SHAKE
                         Oh yes, he's clean all right.

               NORM the road manager appears behind SHAKE.

                                     NORM
                         Morning, lads.

                                     BOYS
                         Morning... Hi, Norm.

                                     NORM
                              (checking them quickly)
                         Well, thank God you're all got here. 
                         Now, listen, I've had this marvellous 
                         idea... now just for a change, let's 
                         all behave like ordinary responsible 
                         citizens. Let's not cause any trouble, 
                         pull any strokes or do anything I'm 
                         going to be sorry for, especially 
                         tomorrow at the television theatre, 
                         because...

               He looks sharply at JOHN who is polishing his nails.

                                     NORM
                         Are you listening to me, Lennon?

                                     JOHN
                              (off-hand)
                         You're a swine, isn't he George?

                                     GEORGE
                              (disinterested)
                         Yeah... a swine.

                                     NORM
                              (just as indifferent)
                         Thanks...

               He sees the GRANDFATHER.

                                     NORM
                         Eh...

                                     BOYS IN CHORUS
                         ...Who's that little old man?

                                     NORM
                         Well, who is he?

                                     RINGO
                         He belongs to Paul.

                                     NORM
                              (accepting the 
                              situation)
                         Ah well, there you go. Look, I'm 
                         going down the diner for a cup of 
                         coffee, are you coming?

                                     PAUL
                         We'll follow you down.

               GRANDFATHER rises.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         I want me coffee.

                                     NORM
                         He can come with Shake and me if you 
                         like.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, look after him. I don't want 
                         to find you've lost him.

                                     NORM
                         Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me 
                         with promises. Come on, Grandad.

               GRANDFATHER joins SHAKE and NORM.

                                     NORM
                              (over Grandfather's 
                              head)
                         He's very clean, isn't he?

               SHAKE and NORM collect GRANDFATHER and are in the process of 
               leaving the compartment when a fat upper class city 
               Englishman, JOHNSON, attempts to enter. There is a bit of 
               confusion and they get tangled up with each other.

                                     JOHNSON
                         Make up your minds, will you!

               At last SHAKE, NORM and GRANDFATHER sort themselves out and 
               JOHNSON enters with his case. The other three go to coffee.

               JOHNSON puts his case up on the luggage rack, then sits down. 
               All his movements are disgruntled... he finally picks up his 
               copy of the Financial Times and burying himself behind it, 
               starts to read. After a moment he looks up, notices the 
               compartment window is open. He gets up and without so much 
               as a "by your leave" he closes it, glares at the BOYS and 
               sits down again.

               The boys exchange looks as if to say... "Hello, Saucy!!"

                                     PAUL
                              (politely)
                         Do you mind if we have it opened?

                                     JOHNSON
                              (briefly)
                         Yes, I do.

                                     JOHN
                         Yeah, but there are four of us, like, 
                         and we'd like it open, if it's all 
                         the same to you, that is.

                                     JOHNSON
                              (rudely)
                         Well, it isn't. I travel on this 
                         train regularly twice a week, so I 
                         suppose I've some rights.

                                     RINGO
                         Aye, well, so have we.

               He disappears behind his paper before the BOYS can say another 
               word.

               RINGO pulls a face at the raised paper and switches on his 
               portable radio. A pop number is playing.

               JOHNSON puts down his paper firmly.

                                     JOHNSON
                         And we'll have that thing off as 
                         well, thank you.

                                     RINGO
                         But I...

               JOHNSON leans over and switches it off.

                                     JOHNSON
                         An elementary knowledge of the Railway 
                         Acts would tell you I'm perfectly 
                         within my rights.

               He smiles frostily.

                                     PAUL
                         Yeah, but we want to hear it and 
                         there's more of us than you. We're a 
                         community, like, a majority vote. Up 
                         the workers and all that stuff!

                                     JOHNSON
                         Then I suggest you take that damned 
                         thing into the corridor or some other 
                         part of the train where you obviously 
                         belong.

                                     JOHN
                              (leaning forward to 
                              him)
                         Gie's a kiss!

                                     PAUL
                         Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid 
                         for our seats too, you know.

                                     JOHNSON
                         I travel on this train regularly, 
                         twice a week.

                                     JOHN
                         Knock it off, Paul, y' can't win 
                         with his sort. After all, it's his 
                         train, isn't it, Mister?

                                     JOHNSON
                         And don't you take that tone with 
                         me, young man!

                                     GEORGE
                         But...

                                     JOHNSON
                              (accusingly)
                         I fought the war for your sort.

                                     RINGO
                         Bet you're sorry you won!

                                     JOHNSON
                         I'll call the guard!

                                     PAUL
                         Aye... but what? They don't take 
                         kindly to insults you know. Ah, come 
                         on, you lot. Let's get a cup of coffee 
                         and leave Toby the manger.

               The boys troop out of the door into the corridor. JOHNSON 
               smiles triumphantly. He is about to settle down to his paper 
               when there is a tap on the corridor window. He looks up and 
               we see pressed against the window a collection of hideous 
               Beatle faces.

                                     PAUL
                         Eh, Mister... can we have our ball 
                         back!

               The man jumps to his feet.

               INTERIOR  OF THE CORRIDOR

               The boys run away like a pack of school boys and disappear 
               round the corner.

               INTERIOR OF THE TRAIN CORRIDOR

               From the P.O.V. of the door leading to the restaurant car.

               The boys come down the corridor in full flight, laughing 
               away like happy idiots. GEORGE and PAUL pull open the sliding 
               doors. The boys look inside.

               INTERIOR  RESTAURANT CAR

               From their P.O.V. we see the car is half empty and at a table 
               in the centre SHAKE and NORM and GRANDFATHER are sitting. On 
               the table is a pile of photos of the boys. NORM and SHAKE 
               are arguing. NORM is being very aggressive, much to SHAKE's 
               discomfort.

                                     NORM
                         Yeah, you want to watch it.

                                     SHAKE
                              (unhappily)
                         It's not my fault.

                                     NORM
                         Well, you stick to that story, son.

                                     SHAKE
                         I can't help it, I'm just taller 
                         than you.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (To NORM slyly)
                         They always say that.

                                     NORM
                         Yeah, well I got me eye on you.

                                     SHAKE
                         I'm sorry Norm, but I can't help 
                         being taller than you.

                                     NORM
                         Well, you don't have to rub me nose 
                         in it. I've a good mind to...
                              (he is about to thump 
                              SHAKE.)

                                     JOHN
                              (enjoying himself)
                         If you're going to have a barney 
                         I'll hold your coats.

                                     NORM
                         He started it.

                                     SHAKE
                         No, I didn't you did...

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, what happened?

                                     SHAKE
                         The old fella wanted these pictures 
                         and Norm said he couldn't have 'em, 
                         all I said was 'aw go on, be big 
                         about it.'

                                     PAUL
                         And?

                                     NORM
                         Your Grandfather pointed out Shake 
                         was always being taller than me just 
                         to spite me.

                                     PAUL
                         I knew it, he started it, I should 
                         have known.

                                     NORM
                         Y'what?

                                     PAUL
                         You two have never had a quarrel in 
                         your life and in two minutes flat 
                         he's got you at it. He's a king mixer. 
                         Adam and Eve, meet the serpent. 
                         Anthony and Cleopatra, there's your 
                         asp. Divide and Conquer, that's this 
                         one's motto. He hates group unity so 
                         he gets everyone at it.

               The BOYS, i.e., JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO, look at each other 
               then at PAUL.

                                     PAUL
                         Aye and we'll have to watch it and 
                         all.

                                     GEORGE
                         I suggest you just give him the photos 
                         and have done with it.

                                     NORM
                         You're right. Here you are, old devil.

               SHAKE and NORM leave. GRANDFATHER grins triumphantly and 
               collects them, then with a sweet smile he turns to PAUL.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Would you ever sign this one for us, 
                         Pauly?

               PAUL does so automatically but in the middle of signing he 
               gets suspicious. GRANDFATHER smiles at him charmingly so 
               PAUL finishes signing.

                                     JOHN
                         Come on let's get this coffee.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Before you go, I think it's only 
                         fair to warn you about me Grandson... 
                         don't let our Paul have his own way 
                         all the time, 'cos if you do he won't 
                         respect you!

               JOHN, RINGO and GEORGE take this up straight away. They all 
               pretend to be girls, RINGO jumps into PAUL's arms.

                                     GEORGE
                              (coyly)
                         Oh, Paul, you can't have your own 
                         way!!!

                                     JOHN
                              (invitingly, in a 
                              Marlene Dietrich 
                              voice)
                         If I let you have your own way, you 
                         little rascal, will you respect me?

                                     PAUL
                              (choked)
                         I'll murder you, Grandfather!

               JOHN waltzes PAUL down to an empty table and the lads sit 
               down.

                                     GEORGE
                         Eh, look at that talent.

               They all gaze across the aisle. From their P.O.V. we see two 
               very attractive young girls, RITA and JEAN, having coffee.

                                     JOHN
                         Give 'em a pull.

                                     PAUL
                         Shall I?

                                     GEORGE
                         Aye, but don't rush. None of your 
                         five bar gate jumps and over sort of 
                         stuff.

                                     PAUL
                         Now what's that supposed to mean?

                                     GEORGE
                              (grinning)
                         I don't really know, but it sounded 
                         distinguished, like, didn't it?

                                     JOHN
                         George Harrison, The Scouse of 
                         Distinction.

               We follow PAUL as he crosses over to the two girls. He places 
               a bowler on his head.

                                     PAUL
                              (in posh accent)
                         Excuse me, but these young men I'm 
                         sitting with wondered if two of us 
                         could join you; I'd ask you meself 
                         only I'm shy.

               The two girls giggle together.

               JOHN and GEORGE are about to move over when GRANDFATHER 
               suddenly appears by their sides.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (sternly)
                         I'm sorry, miss, but you mustn't 
                         fraternise with my prisoners.

                                     JEAN
                         Prisoners!!

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Convicts in transit to Wormwood 
                         Scrubs. Typical old lags, the lot of 
                         'em.

                                     THE BOYS
                         Y'what!!!

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Quiet, you lot, or I'll give you a 
                         touch of me truncheon.
                              (He points at Ringo)
                         That little one's the worst. If we 
                         don't keep him on tablets he has 
                         fits.

                                     RINGO
                              (protesting)
                         Now look here!!

               GRANDFATHER grabs two lumps of sugar from the table and forces 
               them into RINGO'S mouth.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Get out while you can, ladies, his 
                         time's coming round for one of his 
                         turns.

               The frightened girls scurry out of the restaurant car. The 
               boys look in amazement and horror at GRANDFATHER. They are 
               completely flabbergasted.

               GRANDFATHER smiles at them benignly.

               INTERIOR OF RAILWAY COMPARTMENT

               SHAKE and NORM are seated. SHAKE is buried in a science 
               fiction book.

               NORM looks at his watch, slightly worried.

                                     NORM
                         He's been gone a long time.

                                     SHAKE
                              (without looking up)
                         Who?

                                     NORM
                         Paul's grandfather.

                                     SHAKE
                         Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?

                                     NORM
                         Down the... er...

                                     SHAKE
                         Oh, down the... er...?

                                     NORM
                         Yeah, down the... er...

                                     SHAKE
                         Well, give a couple of minutes...

               He resumes reading. But NORM goes on worrying.

               INTERIOR OF ANOTHER RAILWAY COMPARTMENT

               Grandfather is in full flight of conversation with a charming 
               elderly lady, AUDREY, who is listening intently.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (proudly)
                         Yes, I'm their manager, I discovered 
                         them.

                                     LADY AUDREY
                         Did you indeed, Mr. McCartney?

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Now, Audrey, I told you, the name's 
                         John. We show biz people are a 
                         friendly lot.

                                     AUDREY
                         Of course, John.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Yes, they were playing the queues 
                         outside the picture palaces of 
                         Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking 
                         even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, 
                         every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their 
                         potential at once although I had me 
                         doubts about the little fella, a 
                         savage primitive, that Ringo, but it 
                         was him what gave in first. He picked 
                         up a brick and heaved it at me and I 
                         quelled him wid one fierce flash of 
                         me eyes. "Mister, can you spare us a 
                         copper?" he said. I was disarmed by 
                         the grubby little outstretched 
                         mauler... So, I took them under me 
                         managerial banner.

                                     AUDREY
                         The usual ten per cent?

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-
                         five; sure aren't there four of them?

                                     AUDREY
                              (her eyes lighting up)
                         How fascinating. Do go on...
                              (pause)
                         ...John.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         ...Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all 
                         heart... Well, I let...

               INTERIOR CORRIDOR OF TRAIN

               NORM and SHAKE meet with the BOYS as they are returning from 
               coffee.

                                     NORM
                         Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?

                                     JOHN
                         Of course, he's concealed about me 
                         person.

                                     NORM
                         No... he's must have slipped off 
                         somewhere.

                                     PAUL
                              (accusingly)
                         Have you lost him?

                                     NORM
                         Don't exaggerate.

                                     PAUL
                         You've lost him.

                                     SHAKE
                         Put it this way, he's mislaid him.

                                     PAUL
                         You can't trust you with anything, 
                         Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple 
                         you.

                                     SHAKE
                         He can't be far.

                                     JOHN
                         I hope he fell off.

                                     PAUL
                              (mildly)
                         Don't be callous.

                                     RINGO
                         He doesn't like me, honest, I can 
                         tell... It's 'cos I'm little.

                                     GEORGE
                         You've got an inferiority complex, 
                         you have.

                                     RINGO
                         Yeah, I know, that's why I took up 
                         the drums. It's me active compensatory 
                         factor.

               JOHN and PAUL run down the corridor. SHAKE and NORM turn 
               from the door and go in the opposite direction, GEORGE and 
               RINGO follow after the other two boys.

               INTERIOR  CORRIDOR OF TRAIN

               PAUL and JOHN look into various compartments. CLOSE SHOT of 
               RINGO looking into compartments in the manner of Groucho 
               Marx. In one of the compartments we see from RINGO'S P.O.V. 
               the occupant, a glamorous woman, TANIA, with a small lap 
               dog.

               She is beautifully and most expensively dressed. She looks 
               up and sees RINGO.

               RINGO smiles at her and she smiles back. She then beckons 
               him to join her.

               He looks around to see if she means someone else. She nods a 
               negative.

               RINGO looks back enquiringly then points at himself as if to 
               say: "Who, me?"

               TANIA smiles enthusiastically.

               GEORGE has been watching all this.

                                     GEORGE
                         Are you going in?

                                     RINGO
                         No, she'll only reject me in the end 
                         and I'll be frustrated.

                                     GEORGE
                         You never know, you might be lucky 
                         this time.

                                     RINGO
                         No, I know the psychological pattern 
                         and it plays hell with me drum skins.

               He blows the glamorous lady a kiss, then moves sadly on.

               INTERIOR  FURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR

               PAUL enters a compartment followed by JOHN. The TWO GIRLS, 
               RITA and JEAN, from the restaurant car are sitting there.

                                     PAUL
                         Excuse me but have you seen that 
                         little old man we were with?

               The girls jump up, surprised.

                                     JOHN
                         We've broken out, oh, the blessed 
                         freedom of it all!
                              (he extends his hands 
                              as if handcuffed)
                         Eh, have you got a nail file, these 
                         handcuffs are killing me. I was 
                         framed. I was innocent.

                                     PAUL
                         Will you stop it! Sorry to disturb 
                         you, miss...

               He starts to drag JOHN after him.

                                     JOHN
                         I was innocent. I was framed. I won't 
                         go back.

               JOHN is now by the door; he leers at the girls horribly.

                                     JOHN
                         I bet you can guess what I was in 
                         for.

               He cackles like a maniac before disappearing, the door closing 
               after him.

               A waiter carrying a tray with champagne and glasses on it 
               passes into one of the compartments with the blinds down.

                                     PAUL
                         How about that one?

               He moves towards the compartment.

                                     PAUL
                              (to Ringo and George)
                         Did you look in here?

                                     GEORGE
                         No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon 
                         couple or a company director or 
                         something.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, let's broaden our outlook.

               PAUL opens the door of the compartment.

               INTERIOR OF COMPARTMENT

               From the BOYS' P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER and the elderly 
               lady, AUDREY, sipping champagne and nibbling caviar on toast.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (looking up)
                         Congratulate me, boys, I'm engaged.

               PAUL enters and crosses over to him.

                                     PAUL
                         Oh no, you're not. You've gone too 
                         far this time... and who's paying 
                         for all this?

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         It's all taken care of. It's down on 
                         our bill.

                                     PAUL
                         Oh, well that's all right.
                              (realising)
                         What?

                                     AUDREY
                         Young man, kindly moderate your tone 
                         when you address my fiance.

                                     PAUL
                         I'm sorry, Missus, but the betrothal's 
                         off.
                              (he grabs GRANDFATHER 
                              by the arm)
                         I'll refuse me consent, he's over-
                         age!

               AUDREY grabs GRANDFATHER's other arm and pulls back.

                                     AUDREY
                         Leave him alone, after all he's done 
                         for you is this the way you repay 
                         him?

               A tug of war now starts between PAUL and AUDREY.

                                     PAUL
                              (pulling)
                         Him? he's never done anything for 
                         anybody in his life.

                                     AUDREY
                              (pulling)
                         You dare to say that when even those 
                         ridiculous clothes you are wearing 
                         were bought when you forced him to 
                         sell out his gilt edged Indomitables!!

               JOHN and GEORGE jump on the seat egging PAUL and AUDREY on.

                                     JOHN
                         Come on, Auntie, you're winning.

                                     GEORGE
                         Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.

               RINGO attempts to interfere.

                                     RINGO
                         Look, Missus, this is all a 
                         misunderstanding, you see, he's...

                                     AUDREY
                         Keep away from me, you depraved lout, 
                         I know all about your terrible past.

                                     RINGO
                         Y'what?

               She hits RINGO with her handbag and continues struggling 
               with PAUL for GRANDFATHER. RINGO grabs her handbag to stop 
               her hitting him.

                                     RINGO
                         He's given me a bad character, 
                         blackguarding me name to all and 
                         sundry. He's got to be stopped. It's 
                         not fair.

               RINGO pushes out into the corridor, forgetting that he is 
               holding the woman's handbag.

               A voice shouts off from outside.

                                     VOICE OFF
                         That's one of them... stop thief!

               INTERIOR  CORRIDOR

               From Ringo's P.O.V. we see down to the right the city man, 
               JOHNSON, approaching with a GUARD. RINGO turns the other way 
               to the left when he is joined by [the] three other boys. 
               From their P.O.V. down the corridor we see the two girls, 
               autograph books in hand, followed by ten girls from the same 
               school.

               Both groups are closing in on the BOYS. There's no escape.

                                     RINGO
                              (looking down at the 
                              handbag in his hand)
                         Oh Mother!!

               INTERIOR  LUGGAGE VAN

               Very dark, and behind bars we see GRANDFATHER. He is sitting 
               crouched up on a wooden box tea chest and looks pretty 
               miserable. He turns towards the CAMERA; in the foreground of 
               the SHOT we see PAUL standing.

               In the background an impassive GUARD is reading a paper which 
               he does throughout the scene.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (bitterly)
                         And to think me own grandson would 
                         have let them put me behind bars!

                                     PAUL
                         Don't dramatise.

               The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see GRANDFATHER in the luggage 
               compartment of the guards' van. In with him are a crate of 
               chickens and a dog. The chickens peck at him; GRANDFATHER 
               moves listlessly away.

                                     PAUL
                         Let's face it, you're lucky to be 
                         here. If they'd have had their way 
                         you'd have been dropped off at 
                         Stafford already.

               GRANDFATHER proudly turns away from PAUL who dodges round so 
               he can still see his face.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, you've got to admit you've 
                         upset a lot of people. At least I 
                         can keep my eye on you while you're 
                         stuck in here.

               GRANDFATHER turns away again.

                                     PAUL
                         All right, how about Ringo? I mean... 
                         he's very upset, you know... and as 
                         far as your girlfriend, little 
                         Audrey's concerned, she's finished 
                         with men for the rest of her natural, 
                         and another thing...

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of 
                         you have any sense of humour left 
                         these days.

                                     PAUL
                         Oh, it's all right for you but those 
                         two girls were scared to death! 
                         Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do 
                         you do these things?

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (cutting in)
                         You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?

                                     PAUL
                         Yeah... so what?

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Why do you always use your left hand?

                                     PAUL
                         Well, don't be daft, I've got to.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         And I take a left-handed view of 
                         life, I've got to.

               PAUL grins. After a moment of looking at him, PAUL opens the 
               door of the luggage compartment and joins GRANDFATHER on a 
               box.

                                     PAUL
                         Shove up!

               GRANDFATHER produces a penny.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Odds or evens?

               PAUL sighs.

                                     PAUL
                         Odds.

               GRANDFATHER flips the coin.

               The guards' van door opens and JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO come 
               in, with them are the girls, RITA and JEAN.

                                     JOHN
                              (as he sees PAUL behind 
                              the bars)
                         Don't worry, son, we'll get you the 
                         best lawyer trading stamps can buy.

                                     PAUL
                         Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.
                              (to Ringo)
                         Anyroad up... It's all your fault.

                                     RINGO
                         Me? Why?

                                     GEORGE
                         Bag-snatcher.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         That's right; convict without trial... 
                         Habeas corpus.

                                     JOHN
                              (casually)
                         Every morning.

               JOHN has been looking around the guards' van.

                                     JOHN
                         Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't 
                         it? Funny...
                              (he pats the dog)
                         'cos they usually reckon dogs more 
                         than people in England, don't they? 
                         You'd expect something a little more 
                         palatial.
                              (he shudders)
                         Come on. Let's have a little action. 
                         Let's do something, then.

                                     PAUL
                         Like what?

                                     JOHN
                         Well, I've got me gob stopper.
                              (he produces his mouth 
                              organ.)
                         Look, a genuine Stradivarius, hand 
                         tooled at Dagenham.

               And to RINGO's beat on a tea chest they are off, PAUL and 
               GEORGE improvising other sounds, much to the GIRLS' delight. 
               During the number, GRANDFATHER quietly lets the latch off 
               the chicken crate and chickens begin to wander through the 
               scene.

               EXTERIOR  TRAIN IN MOTION FROM ABOVE (NIGHT)

               While the number is progressing, the train is getting nearer 
               and nearer to London.

               EXTERIOR  PLATFORM TERMINUS (NIGHT)

               SHOTS of the station full of GIRLS waiting for the BOYS.

               INTERIOR  GUARDS VAN

               By the time the number finishes the train pulls up with a 
               sharp halt that sends them all sprawling, BOYS and GIRLS.

               NORM enters the guards' van.

                                     NORM
                         Don't move, any of you. They've gone 
                         potty out there. The whole place is 
                         surging with girls.

                                     JOHN
                         Please, can I have one to surge with?

                                     NORM
                         No.

                                     JOHN
                         Ah, go on, you swine.

                                     NORM
                         No, you can't. Look, as soon as I 
                         tell you, run through this door here 
                         and into the big car that's waiting.

               He points and we see a big car parked across the road.

               The BOYS prepare to depart, lining up with GRANDFATHER at 
               the door.

               EXTERIOR  PLATFORM TERMINUS

               Just as they are ready to go, a line of taxis draws up 
               parallel to the train and now separates them from the big 
               car waiting for them.

                                     NORM
                         Oh no!

               GRANDFATHER pushes past the BOYS, holding his coat closed.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         All right, lads, follow me.

               And before NORM can stop him, he darts out of the door, PAUL 
               after him.

               The fans further down the platform see PAUL and charge 
               forward... in a panic NORM and the others follow, JOHN just 
               having time to kiss both the girls.

                                     JOHN
                         Vive l'amour!

               NORM drags him away.

               EXTERIOR  RAILWAY STATION

               The BOYS manage to follow GRANDFATHER by leaping onto a 
               motorized luggage carrier, GEORGE driving and the other three 
               posing as a frozen tableau on the back. GRANDFATHER has 
               arrived at a taxi door. He flings it open and runs through, 
               opening the other door, thus making a safe bridge to the 
               car.

               The BOYS follow and manage to make it to the big car safely. 
               They run towards grandfather's taxi. The FANS have followed 
               the BOYS and we see streams of GIRLS piling through all the 
               taxis one of which contains JOHNSON the city man, opening 
               and shutting the doors to get through, much to the indignation 
               of the TAXI DRIVERS.

               INTERIOR  BIG CAR

               NORM is sitting in front with the driver, FRANK. The four 
               BOYS and GRANDFATHER are squashed together in the back.

                                     NORM
                              (to the driver)
                         Go like the clappers, son!

                                     FRANK
                              (smoothly)
                         That was my entire intention, sir.

               EXTERIOR  STATION

               The car moves off surrounded by the FANS; from a height we 
               see them converge on the car but it moves forcefully out of 
               the station and off.

               It moves into the traffic in the main road and the journey 
               to the hotel begins.

               INTERIOR  HOTEL SUITE  NIGHT

               There is a reception room and off it lead rooms that are 
               presumably bedrooms, bathroom, etc. JOHN is lying sprawled 
               out on a settee listening to a transistor radio, demolishing 
               a basket of fruit. PAUL is sitting at an upright piano and 
               GRANDFATHER is mooching about the room.

               One of the doors opens and GEORGE enters followed by RINGO, 
               none of the BOYS are wearing coats.

                                     RINGO
                         I don't snore.

                                     GEORGE
                         You do -- repeatedly.

                                     RINGO
                              (to John)
                         Do I snore?

                                     JOHN
                              (eating a banana)
                         You're a window rattler, son.

                                     RINGO
                         Well, that's just your opinion. Do I 
                         snore, Paul?

                                     PAUL
                              (stopping playing)
                         With a trombone hooter like yours 
                         it'd be unnatural if you didn't.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.

                                     PAUL
                         Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Well, it may be a joke, but it's his 
                         nose. He can't help having a horrible 
                         great nose, it's the only one he's 
                         got. And his poor little head's 
                         trembling under the weight of it.

               NORM enters with three piles of fan mail and places them in 
               front of JOHN on a table. RINGO is almost in tears, examining 
               his nose in a mirror.

                                     NORM
                         Paul, John, George -- get at it.

                                     JOHN
                         Hello the income tax have caught up 
                         with us at last.

               PAUL and GEORGE gather round the low table. RINGO is left 
               out of it.

                                     RINGO
                         None for me, then?

                                     NORM
                         Sorry.

               John hands RINGO a single envelope.

                                     JOHN
                         That'll keep you busy.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         It's your nose, y'see. Fans are funny 
                         that way. Take a dislike to things. 
                         They'll pick on a nose...

                                     RINGO
                         You go and pick on your own.

               SHAKE enters with a stack of mail about three times larger 
               than all the others put together.

                                     JOHN
                         Is that yours?

                                     SHAKE
                         For Ringo.

               He dumps it in Ringo's arms who staggers into an armchair. 
               The BOYS send him up.

                                     JOHN
                         That must have cost you a fortune in 
                         stamps, Ringo.

                                     GEORGE
                         He comes from a large family.

                                     RINGO
                              (dumping the letters)
                         Well.

               RINGO opens his letter and reads it. It contains a large 
               embossed card.

                                     RINGO
                         Eh, what's Boyd's Club?

               The lads gather round him and PAUL takes the card from him 
               and reads.

                                     PAUL
                         "The Management of Boyd's takes 
                         pleasure in requesting the company 
                         of Mr. Richard Starkey, that's you, 
                         in their recently refinished gaming 
                         rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, 
                         Roulette, and Champagne Buffet." 
                         Blimey!

                                     RINGO
                              (surprised)
                         And they want me?

                                     JOHN
                         Oh, it's got round that you're a 
                         heavy punter.

                                     NORM
                              (snatching the card)
                         Well you're not going.

                                     RINGO
                         Ah.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (taking card from 
                              Norm)
                         Quite right, invites to gambling 
                         dens full of easy money and fast 
                         women, chicken sandwiches and cornets 
                         of caviar, disgusting!

               He pockets the card himself.

                                     RINGO
                         That's mine.

                                     NORM
                         Have done, and you lot get your pens 
                         out.

                                     BOYS
                         Why?

                                     NORM
                         It's homework time for all you college 
                         puddings. I want this lot
                              (he indicates the fan 
                              letters)
                         all answered tonight.

               The BOYS all protest.

                                     NORM
                         I'll brook no denial!

                                     JOHN
                         It's all right for you, you couldn't 
                         get a pen in your foot, you swine.

                                     NORM
                         Come on, Shake, we'll leave 'em to 
                         their penmanship.

               He goes followed by SHAKE.

               There is a pause and JOHN deliberately rises slowly and 
               crosses to his coat. He puts it on and walks to the door.

                                     JOHN
                         While the swine's away the piglets 
                         can play. Well, come on, what are we 
                         waiting for?

               With a whoop PAUL, GEORGE and RINGO collect their coats and 
               head for the door.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         What about all these letters?

                                     BOYS
                         Read 'em!

               They disappear. After a moment GRANDFATHER takes out Ringo's 
               card.

               C.U. GRANDFATHER

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         And a free champagne buffet.

               He grins to himself. At this moment a WAITER enters with a 
               tray. He is clad in tails and GRANDFATHER eyes them longingly, 
               measuring himself the while alongside the startled waiter. 
               He leaves us with no doubt in our minds what he wants, i.e., 
               the waiter's suit.

               INTERIOR  DANCING CLUB  NIGHT

               The club is the latest in modern decor and full of teenagers 
               all enjoying themselves. The CAMERA wanders around the club 
               till it finally picks out JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE and RINGO all 
               crowded around one small table. The music is blaring away 
               from a juke box and the BOYS join the dancers. They are 
               recognised and given smiles and nods of encouragement by all 
               the other customers. During this scene we

                                                                  CUT AWAY:

               INTERIOR  BOYD'S CLUB  NIGHT

               The whole atmosphere is of quiet elegance and loud wealth. 
               Around the baccarat table the rich, bored customers sit barely 
               moving a face muscle as they languidly murmur "suivez" and 
               "banco" to the dealer as he operates the shoe. The manager 
               of the club is beaming with satisfaction as he surveys his 
               customers. One of these customers is clad in evening dress 
               and he has his back to us. The rest of the players (male) 
               are in suits. By each of them is standing a lush lady with a 
               bored sophisticated face that looks as if it has been painted 
               on. From the REVERSE of the LAST SHOT we now see the solitary 
               evening dress player is GRANDFATHER. He looks around him and 
               wipes off his look of enjoyment and elaborately out-bores 
               everyone in the room.

                                     DEALER
                         Alors, M'sieur?

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (nonchalant)
                         Souflée.

               He turns to the buxom BLONDE, who is dripping over him.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         I bet you're a great swimmer. My 
                         turn? Bingo!

                                     CROUPIER
                         Pas "Bingo," M'sieur... Banco.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (taking)
                         I'll take the little darlings anyway.

               He takes up the cards and can't understand that they are 
               unnumbered.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Two and one is three, carry one is 
                         four.

               The buxom BLONDE leans over him.

                                     BLONDE
                         Lay them down.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (disturbed by his 
                              eyeline)
                         Eh?

                                     BLONDE
                         Lay them down.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         We'd be thrown out.

                                     BLONDE
                         Your cards... lay them down... face 
                         up.

               He does so.

                                     CROUPIER
                         Huit à la pointe... et sept.
                              (He pushes chips and 
                              box to Grandfather.)

                                     BLONDE
                         You had a lovely little pair, y'see.

                         I did?

               CROUPIER taps impatiently on box (shoe).

                                     BLONDE
                         They're yours.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         They are?

                                     BLONDE
                         The cards... you're bank.

               INTERIOR  DANCING CLUB

               The BOYS are having a rare old time and the place is really 
               moving.

               INTERIOR  BOYD'S CLUB

               GRANDFATHER is playing and a waiter is checking the 
               requirements of the players.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Bingo!

                              (wearily)
                         M'lord dit "Bingo."

                              (to Grandfather)
                         A little light refreshment.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (lordly)
                         A glass of the old chablis to wash 
                         down a gesture of giblets wouldn't 
                         go amiss.
                              (He resumes his game.)
                         Souflée, chop chop.

               The CROUPIER uses the spatula to pick up a card. GRANDFATHER 
               grabs it and scoops some sandwiches off a passing tray.

               INTERIOR  DANCING CLUB

               The BOYS are at their table again laughing and enjoying 
               themselves, when suddenly their faces freeze.

               From their P.O.V. we see NORM standing glowering down at 
               them. With him is SHAKE. Reluctantly the BOYS arise and follow 
               NORM out.

               INTERIOR  BOYD'S

               GRANDFATHER is looking worried at the call of the card he 
               loses and we see that all his chips have gone. He notices 
               the waiter delivering snacks and champagne to a couple, so 
               quick as a flash, he places a handkerchief over his arm and 
               writing a bill out on a piece of paper, presents it to the 
               couple and collects payment in chips. He then resumes playing.

               INTERIOR  HOTEL ROOM

               Waiter is sitting on chair in underclothes, reading. He hears 
               a noise, says "The manager!" and hides in outer clothes 
               closet. NORM and the BOYS enter saying:

                                     NORM
                         Now get on with it.

                                     JOHN
                         We were going to do it.

                                     NORM
                         Aye, well, now!
                              (He goes through 
                              bedroom)

               RINGO goes to hang up coat in closet. He does so, then crosses 
               to rest.

                                     RINGO
                         Any of you lot put a man in that 
                         cupboard?

                                     ALL
                         A man? No.

                                     RINGO
                         Well somebody did.

               GEORGE goes to cupboard. We see the WAITER from his P.O.V. 
               He closes door, returns to group.

                                     GEORGE
                         He's right, y'know.

                                     BOYS
                              (disinterested)
                         Ah well, there you go.

               SHAKE enters front door, goes to hang up coat and drags WAITER 
               out.

                                     SHAKE
                         Eh, what's all this?

                                     PAUL
                         Oh, him... He's been lurking.

                                     JOHN
                         Aye, he looks a right lurker.

                                     SHAKE
                              (to WAITER)
                         You're undressed. Where are your 
                         clothes?

                                     WAITER
                         The old gentlemen borrowed them to 
                         go gambling at Boyd's.

                                     PAUL
                         No!

                                     RINGO
                         Oh, he's gone to my club, has he?

                                     PAUL
                              (turning on Ringo)
                         Yeah, It's all your fault, getting 
                         invites to gambling clubs. He's 
                         probably in the middle of an orgy by 
                         now.

                                     JOHN
                         Well, what are we waiting for?

                                     SHAKE
                         Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather 
                         of yours is worse than any of you 
                         lot.

               INTERIOR  BOYD'S

               GRANDFATHER is drinking champagne in locked arms with BLONDE.

                                     WAITER
                         Encore de champagne, Monsieur?

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Yes, and I'll have some more champagne 
                         as well.

               He takes another swig of his glass.

                                     MANAGER
                              (beaming)

                         millionaire Irish Peer, filthy rich 
                         of course.

                         Oh I don't know, looks rather clean 
                         to me.

               The MANAGER comes to grandfather's side.

                                     MANAGER
                         Play is about to resume, m'lord.

                              (handing him a chip)
                         Lead me to it, I've a winning itch 
                         that only success can pacify.

               He takes his place at the table. The MANAGER watches for a 
               moment then moves away from the table towards the club 
               reception desk.

               INTERIOR  RECEPTION DESK  BOYD'S CLUB

               JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO, NORM and SHAKE are trying to gain 
               entrance.

                         I'm sorry sir, members and invited 
                         guests only.

                         I've got to get in.
                         It's urgent and important.
                         I've had an invite.
                         Take me to your leader.

                         Shurrup.

               The BOYS do and meanwhile the MANAGER has walked into SHOT. 
               He recognises the BOYS and welcomes them with false 
               enthusiasm. They all start to enter the main room.

                                     NORM
                         All we want to know is have you got 
                         a little old man in there?

                                     MANAGER
                              (pleasantly)

                         He's at it again. Look, I'm his 
                         grandfather... I mean...

                                     BLONDE
                              (standing next to 
                              Grandfather)
                         Oh, it must be the dolly floor show.

                                     JOHN
                         Stay where you are everybody this is 
                         a raid and we want him.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Who are these ruffians?... I've never 
                         seen them before in my life!...
                              (etc.)
                          

               They grab the protesting GRANDFATHER and drag him into the 
               reception area. He keeps trying to return to BLONDE and table. 
               GEORGE and RINGO each take an end of the velvet cord hanging 
               between the two stanchions.

               They exchange ends and re-hook it, thus encircling GRANDFATHER 
               by the entrance desk. They then go to settle up.

                                     MANAGER

                         the small matter of the bill.

               He snaps his fingers and a waiter hands him the bill.

                                     NORM
                              (taking it)
                         I'll settle that.

               He glances at it.

                                     NORM
                         A hundred and eighty pounds!

                         I beg your pardon, guineas.

               At that moment a WAITER appears with a tray full of pound 
               notes.

                                     WAITER
                         Your winnings, my lord, one hundred 
                         and ninety pounds.

               The MANAGER tears up the bill and takes the money.

                                     GRANDFATHER

               The others glower at him.

                              accent])
                         But, gee, Mister, I've got my license 
                         to think of... we're doing a hundred 
                         now...

               The car is stopped in traffic behind a bus. JOHN gets out of 
               car and walks to the front. JOHN leans in window delightedly, 
               he flashes his wallet.

                                     JOHN
                         Ever seen one of these before?

                                     FRANK
                         Ah... a shamus, eh?

                                     JOHN
                         I see you go to the night court.

                                     FRANK
                         I've made the scene.

                                     JOHN
                         Well, remember, its Leathery Magee 
                         up ahead in that convertible, so 
                         cover me in the stake-out.

                                     GEORGE
                         I don't think that bit's right.

                                     JOHN
                         What do you expect from an ad lib... 
                         Raymond Chandler?

               EXTERIOR  STREET

               As the big car overtakes a Company Director's Rolls. JOHN 
               lowers his window and the boys let out an imaginary hail of 
               bullets at the Executive in the back. He reacts violently 
               and starts to shout at them.

               As he does so, he presses the button of his window, so that 
               we hear only part of it. But what we do is unpleasant. He 
               immediately presses the button and the window rises.

               RINGO and PAUL jump out of the car. RINGO takes two drumsticks 
               from his coat pocket and, using them as banderillas, inserts 
               them with style into the radiator grill (V.O. "Ole" from the 
               BOYS). PAUL, then, using his coat as a matador's cloak, does 
               a butterfly pass at the car which has just started up, 
               narrowly missing him, but he keeps in the matador position.

                         gang of school kids. I knew this was 
                         going to happen one day.

                         Eh... don't call him sir, he's got 
                         enough delusions of power as it is.

                         never know why I left.

               EXTERIOR OF AN OLD VICTORIAN MUSIC HALL THEATRE

               Which has been converted to the T.V. studios.

               There are a few groups of GIRL FANS standing outside the 
               front of the theatre, but against the kerb of the pavement 
               is a night-watchman's canvas hut and brazier.

               The car approaches.

                                     NORM
                         Get ready John, open the door and as 
                         it draws up, out you go and straight 
                         in.

               JOHN nods and opens the door. The FANS start to swarm 'round 
               them. To escape, the BOYS dash into the night-watchman's 
               canvas hut, pick it up and run with it to the stage door, 
               revealing the night-watchman, staring in astonishment.

               At the door the BOYS put the hut down and enter the theatre.

               INTERIOR  STAGE DOOR ENTRANCE

               As the BOYS enter, two P.R.O. men in dark suits, stiff white 
               collars and old school ties step forward and smile menacingly.

                                     FIRST P.R.O. MAN
                              (menacingly)
                         Press conference, they're waiting 
                         for you.

                                     NORM
                              (jovially)
                         Give us a couple of shakes to get 
                         our breath.

                                     FIRST P.R.O. MAN
                              (more menacingly)
                         They're waiting now!

               And without more ado they grab an arm each and march the 
               protesting NORM towards the stairs that lead to the dress 
               circle.

                                     PAUL
                         Eh this lot means it. They're even 
                         taking hostages.

               The BOYS, SHAKE and GRANDFATHER rush after the rapidly 
               disappearing NORM, who by now is half way up the stairs.

               INTERIOR OF DRESS CIRCLE LOUNGE BALLROOM

               It is empty except for two barmaids poised ready to serve, 
               standing behind trestle tables full of drinks and sandwiches. 
               The dark suited MEN enter with NORM and close behind them 
               follow GRANDFATHER, SHAKE and the boys. The group arrives at 
               the centre of the lounge and have time to look about and see 
               the food but before they can get to it, from all directions 
               NEWSPAPERMEN and PHOTOGRAPHERS converge upon them.

               Now begins an elaborate tug-of-war between various 
               PHOTOGRAPHERS using their flash attachments and REPORTERS to 
               capture a Beatle and in the midst of this running battle a 
               man with a portable recorder is trying to interview them. 
               Together and singly the BOYS are pushed about the room and 
               while this goes on a hard core of NEWSPAPERMEN are busily 
               devouring sandwiches and pouring themselves drinks, to the 
               annoyance of the BARMAIDS.

               Every time one of the BOYS attempts to get a sandwich or a 
               drink, it is either too late, the plate is empty, or they 
               are intercepted. The single and constant thing we see in the 
               scene is the pushing and pulling, heavy impersonal handling, 
               the boys are just things to be placed like still life in one 
               advantageous position after another.

               During the scene these individual exchanges take place:

                         No, actually, we're just good friends.

               HIGH SHOT of the press reception and we see the BOYS ease 
               their way out until they get to the curtained entrance to 
               the dress circle; completely unnoticed, they slip through.

               INTERIOR  THEATRE DRESS CIRCLE

               The BOYS come up the stairs into the Dress Circle proper. 
               GRANDFATHER and SHAKE are sitting there having a picnic of 
               beer and sandwiches.

                                     PAUL
                              (ironically)
                         Anything to spare?

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         We've just finished, Pauly. Hey 
                         George, write us your John Henry on 
                         this picture.

                         Sure.
                              (He does so)

                                     PAUL
                         Ah well. Eh, look!

               He points, and from PAUL'S P.O.V. we see on stage, the setting 
               up of the show, scenery and lights, cameras and sound 
               equipment are being put into position by a small army of 
               studio staff. DANCERS and SINGERS are milling about as well.

                                     PAUL
                         Let's go and muck in.

                                     JOHN
                         Aye, before anyone stops us.

               They exit to rows of the dress circle and go through the 
               entrance down the narrow stairs to the stalls and on to the 
               stage that is built and extended right into the stalls, which 
               are partly covered up.

               INTERIOR  STAGE

               Everyone is so busy that they hardly notice the BOYS, who 
               wander about and examine the studio equipment. A load of 
               three drum sets are being brought on stage and a voice shouts 
               out:

                                     VOICE
                         Here, what about these electric 
                         guitars?

                                     SHAKE
                         Where are they?

                                     VOICE
                         Back here, mate.

                                     SHAKE
                              (going towards the 
                              voice)
                         I'm coming.

               RINGO is busy setting up his drums, and men are setting up 
               the other sets. He drops a stick and the FLOOR MANAGER 
               retrieves it and is about to tap the drum. The FLOOR MANAGER 
               is a languid young man.

                                     RINGO
                         Leave them drums alone.

                                     FLOOR MANAGER
                         Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.

                                     RINGO
                         If you so much as breathe heavy on 
                         them, I'm out on strike.

                                     FLOOR MANAGER
                         Aren't you being rather arbitrary?

                                     RINGO
                         That's right retreat behind a smoke 
                         screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't 
                         go round messing about with your ear-
                         phones, do I?

                                     FLOOR MANAGER
                         Spoil sport!

                                     RINGO
                         Well!

               RINGO fusses like a mother hen clucking over his drums. The 
               FLOOR MANAGER is furious.

                                     GEORGE
                         He's very touchy about those his 
                         drums, they loom large in his legend.

               RINGO gives his drums a defiant crash and JOHN and PAUL stop 
               whatever they are up to and hurry over.

                                     PAUL
                         What's up?

                                     GEORGE
                              (pointing)
                         He's sulking again.

                                     JOHN
                         I'll show him.

               He picks up a set of drum sticks and bashes back at RINGO, 
               who does a more complicated drum roll. GEORGE now joins in 
               and to PAUL'S encouragement a drum duel starts completely 
               naturally and improvised.

               During this encounter the work proceeds around them and the 
               guitars are brought on and SHAKE sets them to working order. 
               PAUL first, then JOHN and GEORGE take up their own instruments 
               and out of the drum duel emerges one of their numbers.

               INTERIOR  RAMP

               As the number finishes a baldheaded man (he is the T.V. 
               director) storms down the ramp that leads from the control 
               box under the dress circle.

                                     DIRECTOR
                              (with over-exaggerated 
                              calm)
                         All right I'm sorry and let's hear 
                         no more about it. If that's your 
                         opinion, you're probably right. Look, 
                         if you think I'm unsuitable let's 
                         have it out in the open, I can't 
                         stand these back-stage politics.

               By the end of this speech he is standing in front of JOHN 
               who takes the scene in his stride.

                                     JOHN
                         Aren't you tending to black and white 
                         this whole situation?

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Well, quite honestly I wasn't 
                         expecting "a musical arranger" who 
                         would question my ability... picture-
                         wise.

                                     JOHN
                              (to the others)
                         I could listen to him for hours.

                                     PAUL
                         Heave to, what's all this about a 
                         musical arranger?

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Mr. McCartney Senior!

               The BOYS have a giggle at the very idea and at this moment 
               GRANDFATHER appears from behind the DIRECTOR.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Hey Pauly, they're trying to fob you 
                         off wid this musical charlatan but 
                         I've given him the test.

                                     DIRECTOR
                              (bravely)
                         I'm quite happy to be replaced.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (indicating the 
                              director)
                         He's a typical buck-passer.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         I won an award.

                                     JOHN
                         A likely story.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         It's on the wall in my office.

               At this moment NORM comes on the stage, confident, cigar in 
               mouth and serene.

                                     NORM
                         Hello our lot, everyone happy?

               The BOYS, the DIRECTOR, FLOOR MANAGER and GRANDFATHER turn 
               on him and stare silently.

                                     NORM
                         All right, all right. If you don't 
                         need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in 
                         the dressing room till you do.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Please do, I'll not need them for 
                         fifteen minutes. Thank you.

               He glares at GRANDFATHER who glares right back. The DIRECTOR 
               walks away with the FLOOR MANAGER pacifying him.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Give me a bottle of milk and a packet 
                         of Oblivion. Oh, it's a plot, I see 
                         it now, it's all a plot.

               They go left towards the back-stage.

                                     NORM
                              (producing key)
                         Now, come on, I've got the key.

               He leads the lads off right. RINGO is last as he is putting 
               his drum sticks down safely.

               NORM and the BOYS turn on him.

                                     NORM
                         Let's have you.

                                     JOHN
                         Come on speedy!

                                     PAUL
                         Ringo!

                                     GEORGE
                         Wake up!

               RINGO glares at them and follows quickly. As the BOYS move 
               off after NORM, they pass the next act waiting for rehearsal. 
               It is an elegant man in full-tail suit meticulously adjusting 
               his cuff-links. Beside him is a free-standing sign reading 
               "Leslie Jackson and his ten disappearing doves." The BOYS 
               pass him and go through the door.

               GRANDFATHER stops and looks at the performer with respect.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed 
                         your act.

               He slaps the man on the back with happy camaraderie. There 
               is the sound of a dove, a few feathers fall out of the sleeve 
               of the man's coat and he and GRANDFATHER look down at the 
               floor. The man glares at GRANDFATHER, takes out a pen from 
               his pocket, crosses out "10" on his sign, and writes "9" in 
               its place, puts the pen back in his pocket and starts towards 
               the centre stage putting on a false performer's smile as he 
               does.

               INTERIOR  THEATRE  BACK-STAGE CORRIDOR

               The BOYS move down the narrow stairs, and out of the ground 
               floor dressing rooms stream a steady flow of costumed actors 
               and actresses.

               They engulf the lads and force them against the wall -- the 
               actors are all making for the stage door. As the actors push 
               past the boys we see the boys' excited faces, their mouths 
               watering for the costumes. JOHN touches the costume on one 
               actor.

                                     JOHN
                              (to actor)
                         Gear costume!

                                     ACTOR
                              (eyeing him)
                         Swap?

                                     NORM
                         Right, first floor and no messing 
                         about.

               NORM, leading the way, goes up the stairs but as they turn 
               the first corner they are confronted by a group of girls, a 
               game of manners starts, "after you," "No, after you." NORM 
               who is ahead of the group looks down on them in disgust.

                                     NORM
                         Lennon, leave them girls alone or 
                         I'll report you.

               The BOYS let the GIRLS pass and resume the journey, always 
               surrounded by people.

               INTERIOR  DRESSING ROOM AND CORRIDOR

               RINGO'S attention is caught by a door. He crosses and opens 
               it, looking out to a fire escape. The others join him and 
               the four boys step through the door and onto the fire escape.

               EXTERIOR  TOP OF FIRE ESCAPE

               From the BOYS' P.O.V. we see down below into the property 
               yard behind the theatre. It is a long narrow yard full of 
               old coaches, motor cars and all the general debris of hundreds 
               of sets from past theatre shows.

               Through the piles of heaped high junk there are a couple of 
               narrow alleyways.

               The BOYS scamper down the fire escape.

               When they reach the bottom of the alleyways, there is a large 
               door.

               They open it and look through.

               From their P.O.V. we see a large green field quite empty. 
               The boys step through the doorway into the field. We now see 
               from a HELICOPTER SHOT the four BOYS standing together 
               surrounded by space.

               It is the first time they have been alone and unconfined all 
               day.

               They look at each other and grin... then first GEORGE and 
               PAUL let out a whoop and run towards the centre of the field, 
               after a moment JOHN and RINGO follow them. The BOYS pick up 
               some loose straw and insert it under JOHN'S cap and sleeves, 
               turning him into a scarecrow.

               The four BOYS dash about madly calling out to one another 
               and generally horsing around. Out of this emerges an imaginary 
               game of soccer and although there is no ball the game is 
               fast and furious. After a few moments the long shadow of a 
               man falls across the grass.

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                              (off)
                         I suppose you know this is private 
                         property.

               The boys freeze.

               From their P.O.V. we see a big burly middle-aged man glowering 
               at them.

               The boys exchange rueful glances and, under the big man's 
               eye, mooch back towards the gateway they came in by. JOHN is 
               the last to go through. He turns to the man.

                                     JOHN
                         Sorry if we hurt your field, Mister.

               INTERIOR CORRIDOR  BACK-STAGE

               GRANDFATHER is sneaking down the corridor, a pile of photos 
               under his arm.

               INTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE  UNDERNEATH THE STAGE

               Under the stage the usual set of wooden columns that support 
               the stage with lots of furniture and a single light is on; 
               it is placed by the orchestra's entrance to the orchestra 
               pit. GRANDFATHER comes down the stairs and winds his way 
               through the columns until he finds himself a safe little 
               cubby hole and settles himself under the light. He spreads 
               the signed photos of the BOYS in front of him and, adjusting 
               an old-fashioned pair of glasses, ball-point pen in hand 
               begins to copy the BOYS' signatures on to the fresh photos, 
               tutting at his failures and chuckling at his successes. After 
               a moment, there is a sound of someone coming down the stairs. 
               GRANDFATHER darts into a dark patch out of sight.

               The menacing shadows appear on the stairway.

                                     NORM (VOICE OFF)
                         There's no one here.

                                     SHAKE (VOICE OFF)
                         This is the only way they could have 
                         gone.

               We now see GRANDFATHER holding himself stiffly in, he is on 
               some sort of raised platform and he fidgets and in doing so 
               he knocks a lever of some sort. Slowly GRANDFATHER ascends 
               out of shot with a light that grows bigger above him.

               INTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE STAGE

               A rehearsal of the toast scene from a Strauss Operetta. The 
               entire stage is full of SINGERS, glasses in hand they are 
               singing away at each other but in true opera tradition they 
               are addressing out to the audience. Slowly in-between the 
               leading man and leading woman, who are about to embrace, a 
               stage trap opens and a blinking, surprised, GRANDFATHER 
               appears. Here we INTERCUT to the T.V. Control Room for amazed 
               reaction shots of the DIRECTOR and control room CREW.

               Back now on the stage the toast song reaches its climax and 
               the leading man and woman rush into each other's arms, 
               GRANDFATHER sandwiched between them.

               INTERIOR  CORRIDOR AS BOYS PASS THRU ON WAY TO DRESSING ROOM

               JOHN is behind them. JOHN, BOYS and MILLIE are walking towards 
               each other.

                                     MILLIE
                              (as all pass)
                         Hello.

                                     JOHN
                              (stopping... the boys 
                              carry on past, not 
                              noticing her)
                         Hello.

                                     MILLIE
                         Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me 
                         you're...

                                     JOHN
                         No, not me.

                                     MILLIE
                              (insistently)
                         Oh you are, I know you are.

                                     JOHN
                         No, I'm not.

                                     MILLIE
                         You are.

                                     JOHN
                         I'm not, no.

                                     MILLIE
                         Well, you look like him.

                                     JOHN
                         Oh do I? You're the first one who 
                         ever said that.

                                     MILLIE
                         Oh you do, look.

               JOHN looks at himself in the mirror.

               JOHN examines himself in the mirror carefully.

                                     JOHN
                         My eyes are lighter.

                                     MILLIE
                              (agreeing)
                         Oh yes.

                                     JOHN
                         And my nose...

                                     MILLIE
                         Well, yes your nose is. Very.

                                     JOHN
                         Is it?

                                     MILLIE
                         I would have said so.

                                     JOHN
                         Aye, but you know him well.

                                     MILLIE
                              (indignantly)
                         No I don't, he's only a casual 
                         acquaintance.

                                     JOHN
                              (knowingly)
                         That's what you tell me.

                                     MILLIE
                              (suspiciously)
                         What have you heard?

                                     JOHN
                              (blandly)
                         It's all over the place, everyone 
                         knows.

                                     MILLIE
                         Is it? Is it really?

                                     JOHN
                         Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean 
                         I wouldn't have it.

                                     MILLIE
                         I knew I could rely on you.

                                     JOHN
                              (modestly)
                         Thanks.

               MILLIE touches his arm then walks away. After a moment she 
               turns.

                                     MILLIE
                         You don't look like him at all.

               JOHN winks at her and she winks back.

               INTERIOR  DRESSING ROOM

               NORM and SHAKE enter the room. The BOYS' TAILOR is there 
               waiting for the BOYS.

                                     SHAKE
                         Oh they've probably gone to the 
                         canteen, cup of tea, like.

                                     NORM
                         That's too easy for Lennon.

               He crosses to door leading to fire escape.

                                     NORM
                              (dramatically)
                         He's out there somewhere, causing 
                         trouble just to upset me.

                                     SHAKE
                         You're imagining it. You're letting 
                         things prey on your mind.

                                     NORM
                         Oh no... this is a battle of nerves 
                         between John and me.

                                     SHAKE
                         But John hasn't got any.

                                     NORM
                         What?

                                     SHAKE
                         Nerves.

                                     NORM
                         I know, that's the trouble.

               He puffs nervously at his cigarette.

                                     NORM
                         Oh, I've toyed with the idea of a 
                         ball and chain but he'd only rattle 
                         them at me... and in public and all. 
                         Sometimes I think he enjoys seeing 
                         me suffer.

               He hears something.

                                     NORM
                         Get behind that door, they're coming. 
                         Someone's coming. Quick, hide!

               The two men hide behind the door. The boys enter the room, 
               as JOHN is last he shuts the door and faces SHAKE and NORM.

                                     JOHN
                         What are you doing there?

                                     SHAKE
                         Hiding.

                                     JOHN
                         I think you're soft or something.

                                     NORM
                         We weren't hiding.

                                     TAILOR
                         Now?

                                     NORM
                         Now. We were trying to catch you 
                         redhanded. I thought I told you lot 
                         to stay here?

                                     RINGO
                         Well...

                                     NORM
                         When I tell you to stay put, stay 
                         put.

                                     JOHN
                              (down on his knees)
                         Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray.

                                     NORM
                         Oh shurrup and come on John. They're 
                         waiting for you in the studio.

                                     RINGO
                         Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of 
                         work.

                                     NORM
                         Good lad, Ringo.

                                     PAUL
                         Oh, listen to teacher's pet.

                                     GEORGE
                         You crawler.

                                     JOHN
                         He's betrayed the class.

                                     RINGO
                         Oh, leave off!!!

                                     JOHN
                         Temper! Temper!

                                     RINGO
                         Well...

               CLOSE-UP on NORM's long suffering face.

                                     NORM
                         Will you all get a move on! They're 
                         waiting for you!

               By this time the TAILOR has his tape stretched between his 
               hands to measure GEORGE's shoulders. But since GEORGE has 
               moved away, he is measuring space. JOHN takes up his scissors 
               and cuts the tape.

                                     JOHN
                         I now declare this bridge open.

               The BOYS run out the door.

               INTERIOR  BACKSTAGE AREA

               Five beautiful MODELS are standing about in costume. One is 
               knitting a loose wool sweater which is almost completed. 
               There is the sound of a juggling act's music off and a few 
               of the girls are looking off towards the centre stage. At 
               the edge of frame is a collapsible table covered with green 
               baize. On it are three spaced white plates.

               From the door off stage, above which is a sign "To Canteen 
               and Production Offices", GRANDFATHER enters eating a plate 
               of spaghetti on toast. The knitting GIRL sees him and, in 
               mime, asks him to stand still so that she can measure the 
               sweater against him. GRANDFATHER, eager to help, puts his 
               plate of food on the green table between plates two and three. 
               He goes to be measured with the sweater.

               From the onstage area, a juggler's ASSISTANT (pretty girl) 
               in costume backs up and with the usual theatrical flourishes 
               picks up, without looking, plate number ONE and throws it 
               off screen towards centre stage. There is a drum roll from 
               orchestra. She then throws plate number TWO. We CUT on stage 
               to the JUGGLER now balancing the two spinning plates on two 
               poles, one in each hand. He has another pole in his mouth 
               and nods to his ASSISTANT, asking for the THIRD plate.

               We CUT BACK to the ASSISTANT who, still not looking, throws 
               plate THREE which is GRANDFATHER's. There is the sound of an 
               orchestra raggedly stopping and all the hangers-on in the 
               scene look off interestedly.

               We hear the DIRECTOR's voice.

                                     DIRECTOR (V.O.)
                         All right, hold it, hold it... O.K. 
                         John, wipe him down and we'll carry 
                         on with the next act.

                                                                 WE CUT TO:

               centre stage. The JUGGLER is as before but the spaghetti is 
               covering his head, having slipped off the third plate.

               The FLOOR MANAGER is bustling around, trying to help.

               We CUT BACK to back-stage. GRANDFATHER has finished being 
               measured and goes to the green table where he put his plate 
               down. He picks up the only remaining plate, looks at it, 
               wondering where his food has gone, shrugs and heads back 
               towards the exit door as we hear the DIRECTOR's VOICE.

               INTERIOR  T.V. STUDIO FLOOR

               CLOSE-UP on the distraught DIRECTOR.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Where are they? I said, where are 
                         they? Where are they?

                                     FLOOR MANAGER
                              (placating)
                         They're coming, I promise you.

                                     DIRECTOR
                              (fiercely)
                         Now look, if they're not here on 
                         this floor in thirty seconds there's 
                         going to be trouble... understand 
                         me... trouble!!!

               Two STAGE HANDS are walking disinterestedly past, they look 
               at the DIRECTOR.

                                     1ST STAGE HAND
                         What's he on about, Taff?

                                     WELSH STAGE HAND
                         Well... he's being the director. Of 
                         course, he lives in a world of his 
                         own, mind.

               At this moment the boys, NORM, SHAKE and GRANDFATHER appear. 
               The BOYS grab their instruments and prepare to play.

                                     JOHN
                              (to the director)
                         Standing about, eh? Some people have 
                         it dead easy, don't they?

               The director is about to blow his top but manages to hold on 
               and mutter to the heavens.

                                     DIRECTOR
                              (to himself)
                         Of course, once you're over thirty, 
                         you're finished. It's a young man's 
                         medium and I just can't take the 
                         pace.

                                     RINGO
                         Are you as young as that, then?

                                     BOYS
                         Shurrup!

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Isn't it always the way? Picking on 
                         us little fellas.

                                     PAUL
                              (to Shake)
                         Shove the gentleman jockey in the 
                         make-up room or something and keep 
                         your eye on him, will you?

                                     SHAKE
                         I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, 
                         y'know.

                                     PAUL
                              (threateningly)
                         I'll set John on you!

                                     SHAKE
                              (hastily)
                         Oh, anything you say, Paul.

               He leads GRANDFATHER away.

               The BOYS are placed in position, instruments ready. The boom 
               moves in near them. There is a mike hovering just over JOHN'S 
               head. JOHN starts attacking it.

                                     DIRECTOR'S VOICE
                              (over Tannoy)
                         Run through the number and try not 
                         to jiggle out of your positions.

               The BOYS start the number, as the stage hands adjust their 
               settings.

               When they've finished, they stand about spare.

               INTERIOR  T.V. CONTROL ROOM

               The room is crowded with the usual personnel, P.A., elecs, 
               racks, etc.... make-up supervisor and wardrobe mistress.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         That was more or less all right for 
                         me. I'll give them one more run 
                         through then leave them alone until 
                         the dress...
                              (to make-up woman)
                         Oh how about make-up?

                                     MAKE-UP WOMAN
                         Not really, they don't need it any. 
                         We'll just powder them off for shine.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Good. Norm, get them along to make-
                         up will you?

                                     NORM
                              (rising)
                         Sure.

                                     DIRECTOR
                              (looking into the 
                              monitor)
                         And hurry, they're not looking too 
                         happy.

               From the director's P.O.V. we see into the monitor. The boys 
               crowding around RINGO. We cut through the monitor into the 
               same position in the studio.

                         What's the matter with you? You were 
                         bashing away like a madman.

                                     RINGO
                              (briefly)
                         You were twanging too loud.

                                     JOHN
                         How'd you like a dirty great drum 
                         roll giving you a clout right in the 
                         middle of your solo?

                                     GEORGE
                         You're getting out of hand. I don't 
                         know what's come over you today.

                                     RINGO
                         That's right. It's always me, isn't 
                         it?

                                     JOHN
                         Since you ask, yes.
                              (he laughs)
                         Aah, come on, Ring, we love you.

               He puts his arm around Ringo's shoulder.

                                     RINGO
                         Well!

                                     JOHN
                         He'll get over it.

               NORM appears down the ramp speaking as he approaches.

                                     NORM
                         All right, our lot, make-up.

               INTERIOR  MAKE UP ROOM

               A smallish room with a line of chairs facing a wall mirror 
               and a long table. Each place is clearly marked and above 
               each mirror a girl's name: Betty, Angela, Deirdre, Jenny.

               SHAKE and GRANDFATHER are sitting in splendid isolation. 
               They are staring each other out.

                                     SHAKE
                         You blinked!

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         I never did, you did.

               The BOYS enter.

                                     SHAKE
                         Hello, he's not talking to me. He's 
                         having a sulk.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, it must be catching. He's given 
                         it to the champ here.

               He indicates RINGO who ignores him.

                                     NORM
                         Stop picking on him.

                                     RINGO
                         I don't need you to defend me, y'know, 
                         Norm.

                                     JOHN
                         Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.

                                     NORM
                         Sit down, the lot of you.

               At this moment several actors come into the room. They are 
               all dressed in the uniform of officers in Wellington's army. 
               Together with the boys they sit down, Beatles and soldiers 
               all mixed up.

               Now a group of several pretty make-up girls make an entrance 
               and the boys herald their arrival with a chorus of "aye aye's" 
               and wolf whistles. JOHN meanwhile has helped himself to a 
               big beard and the other lads are generally messing about 
               with assorted make-up things.

                                     HEAD MAKE UP GIRL
                         Oh, this is impossible! We'll never 
                         get you all done in time.

                                     ACTOR
                         Well, you'll just have to do us 
                         first... It makes no difference to 
                         them whether they're made up or not.
                              (sees John with beard)
                         And who's me, then?

                                     JOHN
                              (charmingly)
                         My name's Betty...
                              (pointing to the name 
                              on the mirror)
                         Do you want a punch up your frogged 
                         tunic?

               NORM fights his way to JOHN.

                                     NORM
                         Now listen, John, behave yourself or 
                         I'll murder you and, Shake, take 
                         that wig off, it suits you.

               SHAKE has a long blond girl's wig on. With the assistance of 
               the girls, NORM gets the boys seated into the chairs nearest 
               the door. For some reason RINGO now has a Guardsman's busby 
               wedged down almost over his eyes and is sitting with it under 
               a hair drier, reading a copy of "Queen" Magazine.

                                     NORM
                              (to Ringo)
                         What do you think are you're up to?

                                     RINGO
                         Someone put it on me.

                                     JOHN
                         Excuses, that's all we get and you 
                         know you fancy yourself in the 
                         Coldstreams.

               The GIRLS now move in and put make up bibs on the BOYS and 
               start to powder them off.

                                     JOHN
                         You won't interfere with the basic 
                         rugged concept of my personality, 
                         will you, girl?

                                     PAUL
                         Eh, don't take out me lines.

                                     GEORGE
                         Yeah, they give him that "Je ne sais 
                         quoi" rakish air.

               The lads laugh with pleasure.

               RINGO decides to try a little joke.

                                     RINGO
                              (indicating the busby 
                              he is still wearing)
                         Short back and sides, please.

               The other look at him with mock disgust.

                                     PAUL
                         Behave...

                                     JOHN
                         Foreign devil ...

                                     GEORGE
                         Control yourself...

               GRANDFATHER has been watching the powdering process.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         In my considered opinion you're a 
                         bunch of sissies.

               JOHN grabs a powder puff from his girl.

                                     JOHN
                         You know you're only jealous!

               And dabs the old man liberally with the powder much to 
               GRANDFATHER's annoyance.

                                     NORM
                         Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll 
                         tell them all the truth about you.

                                     JOHN
                         You wouldn't!

                                     NORM
                         I would though.

               NORM goes out.

                                     PAUL
                         What's he know?

                                     JOHN
                         Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me 
                         and give me personality doubts... 
                         oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, 
                         mind.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (impatiently)
                         Lookit, I thought I was supposed to 
                         be getting a change of scenery and 
                         so far I've seen a train and a room, 
                         a car and a room and a room and a 
                         room. Well, that's maybe all right 
                         for a bunch of powdered gee-gaws 
                         like you lot but I'm feeling decidedly 
                         strait-jacketed. This is no life for 
                         a free-booting agent of my stamp. 
                         I'm a frustrated man and that class 
                         of McCartney is a dangerous McCartney.

                                     GIRL
                              (admiringly)
                         What a clean old man.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (touchingly)
                         You're too young for a fella of my 
                         cosmopolitan tastes, so don't press 
                         your luck.

                                     JOHN
                         He's sex-obsessed, the older 
                         generation are leading this country 
                         to galloping ruin.

               NORM returns leaving the door open, the boys hear the sound 
               of music coming from the studio.

                                     NORM
                         They're nearly ready for you. They're 
                         just finishing the band call.

                                     JOHN
                              (jumping from his 
                              seat)
                         Gear! Come on, girls, let's have a 
                         bit of a dance.

                                     JOHN'S GIRL
                         I don't think its allowed.

                                     JOHN
                         Well... it wouldn't be any fun if it 
                         was!

               The BOYS drag the make-up GIRLS out of the room and into the 
               studio.

               The GIRLS are still trying to finish making the BOYS up.

               As the BOYS and MAKE-UP GIRLS dance past, we see one of the 
               "Strauss" singers combing his long hair straight back. Two 
               STAGE HANDS swing a wind machine past him and his hair is 
               blown straight forward into a Beatle cut.

                                     JOHN
                              (passing him)
                         Never.

               During dance, GEORGE takes off wig and places it on dummy, 
               revealing identical hair underneath.

               INTERIOR  T.V. STUDIO FLOOR

               The work is still going on and the music is up full blast, 
               the BOYS enter and with the GIRLS [and] they start a wild 
               dance, hippy, shake, zulu, blue beat, the lot. LIONEL and 
               DANCERS are doing their routine on one side of the stage... 
               it becomes a challenge dance between both groups. JOHN swings 
               his GIRL onto the motorized CAMERA, Western style, and starts 
               to track through the GROUP. GEORGE is on another CAMERA.

               INTERIOR  CONTROL ROOM

               The whole control room crew are watching the dance on all 
               the monitors.

               The DIRECTOR is about to stop the boys but his GIRL P.A. 
               glares at him, with a shrug he lets the dance go on.

               We now cut between the dancers on the monitors and the boys 
               actual dancing down on the studio floor. When the recorded 
               music stops, they grab their instruments and go into a number.

               So we can watch every aspect of their work and with so many 
               monitors it gives the impression that there are many more 
               boys than just four.

               When the number finally ends we are back in the studio on 
               the floor.

               INTERIOR  T.V. STUDIO FLOOR DIRECTOR'S VOICE OVER TANNOY

               Thank you gentlemen, you can break now while we push on with 
               the show.

               The boys acknowledge this with a quaver of guitar chords and 
               a drum roll.

               NORM is on them at once.

                                     NORM
                         That was great, you've got about an 
                         hour but don't leave the theatre.

               JOHN grabs the arm of a sexy girl dancer.

                                     JOHN
                         She's going to show me her stamp 
                         collection.

                                     PAUL
                              (grabs a showgirl)
                         So's mine.

                                     NORM
                         John, I'm talking to you. This final 
                         run through is important. Understand? 
                         Important.

                                     JOHN
                              (like a pig)
                         Oink! Oink!

               They dash off with the two beauties.

               GRANDFATHER is hovering in the background with SHAKE.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         I want me cup of tea.

                                     NORM
                         Shake.

                                     SHAKE
                         I'm adjusting the decibels on the 
                         inbalance.

                                     NORM
                         Clever.
                              (he turns)
                         George.

               But GEORGE is disappearing out of the door.

               NORM turns to RINGO.

                                     NORM
                         Look after him.

                                     RINGO
                         But...

                                     NORM
                         Do I have to raise me voice?

                                     RINGO
                              (choked)
                         Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.

               And the two of them walk off, Ringo leading.

               INTERIOR  BACKSTAGE

               A man, whose act is playing tunes by hitting himself on the 
               head, is swallowing a handful of aspirin tablets. He starts 
               rehearsing his act, which consists of throwing his head back 
               and slapping his cheeks. Next to him, a JUGGLER is practising 
               with four table tennis balls.

               GRANDFATHER passes him and bumps his arm slightly. Only 3 
               balls come down. There is the sound of coughing off.

                                                                 WE CUT TO:

               THE HEAD-PLAYER being patted on the back. The ball drops out 
               of his mouth and bounces slowly on the studio floor.

               INTERIOR  T.V. STUDIO CANTEEN

               The canteen is about half full of actors many of which are 
               dressed as Nazi soldiers, with mock blood bandages and arm 
               bands. Also there are a sprinkling of T.V. people. At a table 
               sits GRANDFATHER and RINGO. RINGO is deeply engrossed in a 
               book and GRANDFATHER has a near empty cup of tea in front of 
               him. The old man is bored and looks about him slyly. He then 
               looks at Ringo who is innocently occupied, a malicious gleam 
               comes into GRANDFATHER's eye. He decides to have a go at 
               RINGO and sits staring at him. RINGO gradually becomes aware 
               of the stare and shifts uncomfortably then tries to continue 
               reading his book.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (disgustedly to no 
                              one in particular)
                         Will you ever look at him, sitting 
                         there wid his hooter scraping away 
                         at that book!

                                     RINGO
                         Well... what's the matter with that?

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (taking the book from 
                              him)
                         Have you no natural resources of 
                         your own? Have they even robbed you 
                         of that?

                                     RINGO
                              (snatching back his 
                              book)
                         You can learn from books.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Can you now? Aah... sheeps' heads! 
                         You learn more by getting out there 
                         and living.

                                     RINGO
                         Out where?

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Any old where... but not our little 
                         Richard... oh no! When you're not 
                         thumping them pagan skins, you're 
                         tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!

                                     RINGO
                              (defiantly)
                         Books are good!

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (countering)
                         Parading's better!

                                     RINGO
                         Parading?

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (marching up and down 
                              the canteen)
                         That's it, parading the streets... 
                         trailing your coat... bowling along... 
                         living!

                                     RINGO
                         Well, I am living, aren't I?

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         You're living, are you? When was the 
                         last time you gave a girl a pink-
                         edged daisy? When did you last 
                         embarrass a sheila wid your cool 
                         appraising stare?

                                     RINGO
                         Eh... you're a bit old for that sort 
                         of chat, aren't you?

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         At least I've a backlog of memories, 
                         but all you've got is that book!

                                     RINGO
                         Aaah... stop picking on me... you're 
                         as bad as the rest of them.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         So you are a man after all.

                                     RINGO
                         What's that mean?

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Do you think I haven't noticed... do 
                         you think I wasn't aware of the drift? 
                         Oh... you poor unfortunate scuff, 
                         they've driven you into books by 
                         their cruel, unnatural treatment, 
                         exploiting your good nature.

                                     RINGO
                              (not too sure)
                         Oh... I dunno.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (confidingly)
                         And that lot's never happier than 
                         when they're jeering at you... and 
                         where would they be without the steady 
                         support of your drum beat, I'd like 
                         to know.

                                     RINGO
                         Yeah... that's right.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         And what's it all come to in the 
                         end?

                                     RINGO
                              (defensively)
                         Yeah... what's in it for me?

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         A book!

                                     RINGO
                         Yeah... a bloomin' book!

               He throws the book down.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         When you could be out there betraying 
                         a rich American widow or sipping 
                         palm wine in Tahiti before you're 
                         too old like me. A fine neat and 
                         trim lad the class of you should be 
                         helping himself to life's goodies 
                         before the sands run out. Being an 
                         old age pensioner's a terrible drag 
                         on a man and every second you waste 
                         is bringing you nearer the Friday 
                         queue at the Post Office.

                                     RINGO
                         Yeah... funny really, 'cos I'd never 
                         thought of it but being middle-aged 
                         and old takes up most of your time, 
                         doesn't it?

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (nodding)
                         You're only right.

                                     RINGO
                              (nodding back)
                         I'm not wrong.

               There is a pause, then RINGO rises and crosses to the door.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Where are you off to?

                                     RINGO
                         I'm going parading before it's too 
                         late!

               RINGO leaves and GRANDFATHER laughs at what he has done, 
               then realizes its full meaning and looks worried.

               INTERIOR  CORRIDOR AND STAIRWAY

               RINGO comes along the corridor then down the narrow stairs. 
               Half-way down he comes face to face with GEORGE who is coming 
               up the stairs.

                                     GEORGE
                         Eh, Ringo, do you know what happened 
                         to me?

                                     RINGO
                              (passing him)
                         No. I don't.

               As he goes round the corner RINGO turns on the surprised 
               GEORGE.

                                     RINGO
                         You want to stop being so scornful, 
                         it's twisting your face.

               INTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE NEAR STAGE DOORMAN'S OFFICE

               JOHN and PAUL are chatting up a couple of girls, when they 
               see RINGO approaching they break off the conversation.

                                     JOHN
                         Here he is, the middle-aged boy 
                         wonder.

               RINGO looks at JOHN hard.

                                     PAUL
                         Eh. I thought you were looking after 
                         the old man.

                                     RINGO
                              (with simple dignity)
                         Get knotted!

               PAUL and JOHN gape at him. For good measure Ringo takes a 
               quick photograph of them before he leaves them flabbergasted 
               and walks off into the street.

                                     PAUL
                         We've got only half an hour till the 
                         final run-through. He can't walk out 
                         on us.

                                     JOHN
                         Can't he? He's done it, son!

               GEORGE runs towards them.

                                     GEORGE
                         Eh, I don't know if you realise it, 
                         but...

                                     PAUL
                         We do.

                                     GEORGE
                         Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him 
                         up.

                                     PAUL
                         He hasn't.

                                     GEORGE
                         Yes, he's filled his head with notions 
                         seemingly.

                                     PAUL
                         The old mixer, come on we'll have to 
                         put him right.

               The three of them go into the street.

               EXTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE STAGE DOOR ENTRANCE

               The boys look up and down but RINGO has completely 
               disappeared.

                                     PAUL
                         We'll split up and search for him, 
                         he can't be far.

               They now all start to go off in the same direction, they 
               pause, there are three roads they can take but each time 
               they begin to move they all go the same way.

                                     JOHN
                         It's happened at last, we've become 
                         a limited company.

                                     GEORGE
                         I'll look in here again.

               PAUL gives him a push to the left and GEORGE to the right 
               and going straight ahead himself they part and go their 
               separate ways.

               EXTERIOR  STREET

               RINGO is walking along taking photographs with his camera 
               when some girls recognise him and start to follow him. They 
               quicken their pace and RINGO runs ahead of them. He turns 
               and comes into another street.

               He sees a second-hand clothes shop with a sign saying "We 
               Buy Anything" and enters the shop just before the pursuing 
               girls come round the corner. The girls stand about looking 
               in all directions. After a moment RINGO comes out of the 
               shop. He is wearing a long mackintosh and a natty cap pulled 
               well down. He is ignored by the girls who don't recognise 
               him. Realising this he goes back and ogles one of them. She 
               glares at him.

                                     RINGO
                         Hello.

                                     GIRL
                         Get out of it, short house!

               CLOSE-UP on Ringo's secret but happy smile as he walks briskly 
               down the road.

               EXTERIOR  TOW PATH  CANAL

               RINGO kicks at a brick. He kicks stylishly but misses so 
               tries again, misses again, but finally kicks the stone which 
               doesn't budge so he bends down and pulls it out of the ground. 
               It is quite big. Three quarters of it being below the surface. 
               Having got it he now decides to throw it away. As he does so 
               the same POLICEMAN rides past on a bicycle.

                                     POLICEMAN
                         Ain't you got no more bleeding sense 
                         than to go round chucking bricks 
                         about.

               Before RINGO has time to answer the man has disappeared.

                                     RINGO
                              (shouting after him)
                         Southerner!

               He looks at the canal water moodily; at this moment a large 
               lorry tyre rolls down the incline and bashes him slap in the 
               back, sprawling him on the path, the tyre on top of him. A 
               small boy appears after the tyre and stands over the prostrate 
               RINGO.

                                     BOY
                         Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop 
                         playing with it.

                                     RINGO
                         Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal 
                         weapon. Have you got a licence for 
                         it?

                                     BOY
                         Oh don't be so stroppy!

                                     RINGO
                              (getting up)
                         Well! A boy of your age bowling "hoop" 
                         at people. How old are you anyway?

                                     BOY
                              (aggressively)
                         Nine.

                                     RINGO
                         Bet you're only eight and a half.

                                     BOY
                              (countering swiftly)
                         Eight and two thirds.

                                     RINGO
                         Well, there you are and watch it 
                         with that hoop.

                                     BOY
                         Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 
                         'cause you're old.

                                     RINGO
                         Shurrup!

                                     BOY
                         I bet you're
                              (searching for an age)
                         -- sixteen!

                                     RINGO
                         Fifteen and two thirds, actually.

                                     BOY
                         Well --

                                     RINGO
                         All right, take your hoop and bowl.

               He moves off and the BOY follows.

                                     BOY
                         Oh you can have it, I'm packing it 
                         in -- it depresses me.

                                     RINGO
                         Y'what?

                                     BOY
                         You heard, it gets on my wick.

                                     RINGO
                         Well that's lovely talk, that is. 
                         And another thing, why aren't you at 
                         school?

                                     BOY
                         I'm a deserter.

                                     RINGO
                              (smiling in spite of 
                              himself)
                         Are you now?

                                     BOY
                         Yeah, I've blown school out.

                                     RINGO
                         Just you?

                                     BOY
                         No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding 
                         Dong.

                                     RINGO
                         Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?

                                     BOY
                         Yeah, that's right, they was supposed 
                         to come with us but they chickened.

                                     RINGO
                         Yeah? And they're your mates are 
                         they?

                                     BOY
                              (sighing)
                         Yeah.

                                     RINGO
                         Not much cop without 'em, is it?

                                     BOY
                              (defensively)
                         Oh, it's all right.

                                     RINGO
                              (disbelievingly)
                         Yeah?

                                     BOY
                         Yeah.

                                     RINGO
                         What they like?

               BOY is glad to have something to talk about.

                                     BOY
                              (enthusiastically)
                         Ginger's mad, he says things all the 
                         time and Eddy's good at punching and 
                         spitting.

                                     RINGO
                         How about Ding Dong?

                                     BOY
                         He's a big head and he fancies himself 
                         with it but you know it's all right 
                         'cos he's one of the gang.

               RINGO nods his head understandingly and they mooch on 
               together.

                                     BOY
                         Why aren't you at work?

                                     RINGO
                         I'm a deserter, too.

                                     BOY
                         Oh.

               At this moment a child's voice shouts out "Charley" and from 
               RINGO'S P.O.V. we see three kids. RINGO turns to the BOY and 
               looks at them enquiringly.

                                     BOY
                              (to Ringo)
                         See you.

               The BOY runs off to join his mates. As he joins them they 
               punch and scuffle together. They are obviously a gang. RINGO 
               is left alone.

               INTERIOR  CORRIDOR T.V. THEATRE

               GEORGE comes round the corner, looking for RINGO, then grins 
               and walks past a sign saying "Canteen and Production Office 
               Opposite." He comes to the exit door, crosses to a modern 
               building across from the theatre.

               He enters [the] building.

               INTERIOR  OFFICE

               It is the reception room that leads to an inner office. Behind 
               a desk sits a smart young woman typing busily as GEORGE 
               enters. He is surprised when he sees the girl; she looks up 
               and speaks to him at once.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Oh, there you are!

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a 
                         mistake.

                                     SECRETARY
                              (tartly)
                         You haven't, you're just late.
                              (She rises and crossing 
                              over to him examines 
                              him critically.)
                         Oh, yes, he's going to be very pleased 
                         with you.

                                     GEORGE
                         Is he?

                                     SECRETARY
                         Yes, you're quite a feather in the 
                         cap.
                              (She crosses to the 
                              desk and picks up 
                              the inter-office 
                              phone.)
                         Hello, I've got one... oh, I think 
                         so... yes, he can talk... Well... I 
                         think you ought to see him.
                              (she smiles)
                         Of course, right away.

               She crosses to the inter-office door. On the door is written 
               SIMON MARSHAL... she opens it.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Well... come on.

                                     GEORGE
                         Sorry.

               He follows her quickly in.

               INTERIOR  THE INNER OFFICE

               A large room, part production office with models and sets, 
               drawing board with ground plans, the other part of the room 
               a mixture of Pop and Queen's magazine decor.

               Behind a large desk sits SIMON MARSHAL, a bland but slightly 
               irritable young man of about thirty-five. He is wearing the 
               ultimate in the current smart set fashion. He is attended by 
               a couple of underlings ADRIAN and TONY and behind him on the 
               wall is a poster of a girl.

               Across the poster is printed, "Way Out, your own T.V. Special 
               with Susan Campey. Director, Simon Marshal."

                                     SECRETARY
                              (proudly)
                         Will this do, Simon?

                                     SIMON
                              (looking at George)
                         Not bad, dolly, not really bad.
                              (he motions to George)
                         Turn around, chicky baby.

               GEORGE does so.

                                     SIMON
                         Oh yes, a definite poss. He'll look 
                         good alongside Susan.
                              (he indicates the 
                              girl on the poster)
                         All right, Sunny Jim, this is all 
                         going to be quite painless. Don't 
                         breathe on me, Adrian.

               ADRIAN has recognised GEORGE and is trying to stop SIMON.

                                     GEORGE
                         Look, I'm terribly sorry but I'm 
                         afraid there's been some sort of a 
                         misunderstanding.

                                     SIMON
                              (sharply)
                         Oh, you can come off it with us. You 
                         don't have to do the old adenoidal 
                         glottal stop and carry on for our 
                         benefit.

                                     GEORGE
                         I'm afraid I don't understand.

                                     SIMON
                         Oh, my God, he's a natural.

                                     SECRETARY
                              (anxiously)
                         Well, I did tell them not to send us 
                         any more real ones.

                                     SIMON
                         They ought to know by now the phonies 
                         are much easier to handle. Still 
                         he's a good type.

               He now speaks to GEORGE in the loud voice that the English 
               reserve for foreigners and village idiots.

                                     SIMON
                         We want you to give us your opinion 
                         on some clothes for teenagers.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, by all means, I'd be quite 
                         prepared for that eventuality.

                                     SIMON
                         Well, not your real opinion, 
                         naturally. It'll be written out and 
                         you'll learn it.
                              (to secretary)
                         Can he read?

                                     GEORGE
                         Of course I can.

                                     SIMON
                         I mean lines, ducky, can you handle 
                         lines?

                                     GEORGE
                         I'll have a bash.

                                     SIMON
                         Good. Hart, get him whatever it is 
                         they drink, a cokearama?

                                     GEORGE
                         Ta.

                                     SIMON
                         Well, at least he's polite. Tony 
                         Show him the shirts, Adrian.

               A collection of shirts are produced and GEORGE looks at them. 
               While he is doing this SIMON briefs him.

                                     SIMON
                         Now, you'll like these. You really 
                         "dig" them. They're "fab" and all 
                         the other pimply hyperboles.

                                     GEORGE
                         I wouldn't be seen dead in them. 
                         They're dead grotty.

                                     SIMON
                         Grotty?

                                     GEORGE
                         Yeah, grotesque.

                                     SIMON
                              (to secretary)
                         Make a note of that word and give it 
                         to Susan. I think it's rather touching 
                         really. Here's this kid trying to 
                         give me his utterly valueless opinion 
                         when I know for a fact within four 
                         weeks he'll be suffering from a 
                         violent inferiority complex and loss 
                         of status if he isn't wearing one of 
                         these nasty things. Of course they're 
                         grotty, you wretched nit, that's why 
                         they were designed, but that's what 
                         you'll want.

                                     GEORGE
                         But I won't.

                                     SIMON
                         You can be replaced you know, chicky 
                         baby.

                                     GEORGE
                         I don't care.

                                     SIMON
                         And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. 
                         The new thing is to care passionately, 
                         and be right wing. Anyway, you won't 
                         meet Susan if you don't cooperate.

                                     GEORGE
                         And who's this Susan when she's at 
                         home?

                                     SIMON
                              (playing his ace)
                         Only Susan Campey, our resident 
                         teenager. You'll have to love her. 
                         She's your symbol.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets 
                         everything wrong?

                                     SIMON
                         I beg your pardon?

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather 
                         round the T.V. set to watch her for 
                         a giggle. Once we even all sat down 
                         and wrote these letters saying how 
                         gear she was and all that rubbish.

                                     SIMON
                         She's a trend setter. It's her 
                         profession!

                                     GEORGE
                         She's a drag. A well-known drag. We 
                         turn the sound down on her and say 
                         rude things.

                                     SIMON
                         Get him out of here!!

                                     GEORGE
                              (genuinely surprised)
                         Have I said something amiss?

                                     SIMON
                         Get him out of here. He's knocking 
                         the programme's image!!

               The underlings hustle GEORGE to the door.

                                     GEORGE
                              (smiling)
                         Sorry about the shirts.

               He is ejected through the door.

                                     SIMON
                         Get him out.
                              (he stops in mid-shout)
                         You don't think he's a new phenomenon, 
                         do you?

                                     SECRETARY
                         You mean an early clue to the new 
                         direction?

                                     SIMON
                              (rummaging in his 
                              desk)
                         Where's the calendar?
                              (he finds it)
                         No, he's just a trouble maker. The 
                         change isn't due for three weeks. 
                         All the same, make a note not to 
                         extend Susan's contract. Let's not 
                         take any unnecessary chances!

               EXTERIOR  STREET  PUB ON THE CORNER

               The sign on the pub is Liverpool Arms. RINGO is standing 
               looking up at it. He decides to go in and does so.

               INTERIOR  T.V. CONTROL ROOM

               The atmosphere is tense. GRANDFATHER is standing miserable 
               in front of the DIRECTOR, the criminal confronted by the 
               judge. SHAKE and NORM are flanking him grimly.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         I'm sorry lads, I didn't mean it, 
                         honest.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         If he says that again, I'll strike 
                         him.

                                     SHAKE
                              (unconvincingly)
                         They'll be back, they're good lads, 
                         they'll be back.

                                     DIRECTOR
                              (disgusted)
                         Yes? Well they've got only ten minutes 
                         to the final run-through.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         I meant no harm. I was only trying 
                         to encourage little Ringo to enjoy 
                         himself.

                                     NORM
                              (grimly, C.U.)
                         God knows what you've unleashed on 
                         the unsuspecting South. It'll be 
                         wine, women and song all the way 
                         with Ringo once he's got the taste 
                         for it.

               INT. PUB  PUBLIC BAR

               CLOSE-UP on RINGO. He is eating a bone dry sandwich that 
               curls up at the end. He puts it down with disgust. He has a 
               lager glass in his hand.

                                     BARMAID
                              (accusingly)
                         That was fresh this morning.

               We now see the pub is full of enormous cockney workmen downing 
               pints.

               RINGO is very much alone. He moves away from the bar towards 
               a group that is standing together, they've an average height 
               of over six-foot.

               There is a group at a dart board. Another group is playing 
               bar skittles and a third group is around a pin-ball table.

               Near the bar is a shove-halfpenny board with two players. 
               There is a caged parrot nearby.

                                     BARMAID
                              (to Ringo)
                         That'll be two and nine...

               RINGO fumbles some change out of his pocket. A few coppers 
               fall from his hand on to the shove-halfpenny board just as 
               the crucial point has been made. The men glare at him. 
               Embarrassed, he moves away and without looking, places his 
               glass on the skittles table just as a player swings the 
               string, which hits Ringo's glass. More embarrassed, RINGO 
               backs away, unfortunately into the pin-table just as a winning 
               score is about to be reached. He bumps it very slightly, but 
               enough to cause it to TILT. He then moves to the dart board. 
               By this time most of the pub is staring at him. With great 
               style he takes the darts. The first throw goes into a cheese 
               sandwich which a man is pointing in demonstration.

               The second we see arrive into a pint of bitter and then we 
               see RINGO shoot the third dart and hear the sound of the 
               parrot shouting angrily, off. The BARMAID has had enough.

                                     BARMAID
                         Right... On your way!

                                     RINGO
                         Y'what?

                                     BARMAID
                         You heard, on your way, troublemaker!

               Now the centre of attention, RINGO backs out of the pub, 
               followed by every eye in the place, the BARMAID and a few 
               players following him to the door...

               EXTERIOR  STREET OUTSIDE PUB

               RINGO comes out and crosses road, watched by the POLICEMAN 
               who is now quite suspicious.

               EXTERIOR  STREET

               PAUL comes down the street looking about him for RINGO. In 
               the street is an old building, the sort of place that is 
               highly favoured for TV rehearsals. There is a sign on the 
               door, "TV Rehearsal Room." As PAUL draws near, a load of 
               actors and extras, etc. are leaving, they are in costume, 
               they are the ones who earlier had been going to a word 
               rehearsal. When PAUL gets near the entrance he decides to go 
               inside.

               INTERIOR  HALL

               PAUL enters and wanders about. He reaches a door, pushes it 
               open and looks in. He sees a GIRL clad in period costume. 
               She is moving around the room and obviously acting. PAUL 
               watches her for a moment and then decides to go in.

               INTERIOR  REHEARSAL ROOM

               PAUL goes into the room. The GIRL is in mid-flight. She is 
               very young and lovely and completely engrossed in what she 
               is doing. The room is absolutely empty except for PAUL and 
               herself. She is acting in the manner of an eighteenth-century 
               coquette, or, to be precise, the voice English actresses use 
               when they think they are being true to the costume period... 
               her youth however makes it all very charming.

                                     GIRL
                         If I believed you, sir, I might do 
                         those things and walk those ways 
                         only to find myself on Problem's 
                         Path. But I cannot believe you, and 
                         all those urgings serve only as a 
                         proof that you will lie and lie again 
                         to gain your purpose with me.

               She dances lightly away from an imaginary lover and as she 
               turns she sees PAUL who is as engrossed in the scene as she 
               was.

                                     GIRL
                              (surprised)
                         Oh!

                                     PAUL
                              (enthusiastically)
                         Well... go 'head, do the next bit.

                                     GIRL
                         Go away! You've spoilt it.

                                     PAUL
                         Oh, sorry I spoke.

               He makes no attempt to go. He simply continues to look 
               steadily at the girl; then he smiles at her. She is undecided 
               what to do next.

                                     GIRL
                         Are you supposed to be here?

                                     PAUL
                         I've got you worried, haven't I?

                                     GIRL
                         I'm warning you, they'll be back in 
                         a minute.

                                     PAUL
                         D'you know something, "They" don't 
                         worry me at all. Anyroad, I only 
                         fancy listening to you... that's all 
                         but if it worries you... well...

                                     GIRL
                         You're from Liverpool, aren't you?

                                     PAUL
                              (ironically)
                         How'd you guess?

                                     GIRL
                              (seriously)
                         Oh, it's the way you talk.

                                     PAUL
                              (innocently)
                         Is it... is it, really?

                                     GIRL
                              (suspiciously)
                         Are you pulling my leg?

                                     PAUL
                              (looking her straight 
                              in the eye)
                         Something like that.

                                     GIRL
                              (unsure)
                         I see.
                              (airily)
                         Do you like the play?

                                     PAUL
                         Yeah... I mean, sure, well, I took 
                         it at school but I only ever heard 
                         boys and masters saying those lines, 
                         like, sounds different on a girl.
                              (smiles to himself)
                         Yeah, it's gear on a girl.

                                     GIRL
                         Gear?

                                     PAUL
                         Aye, the big hammer, smashing!

                                     GIRL
                         Thank you.

                                     PAUL
                         Don't mench... well, why don't you 
                         give us a few more lines, like?

               GIRL pouts.

                                     PAUL
                         You don't half slam the door in 
                         people's faces, do you? I mean, what 
                         about when you're playing the part, 
                         like, hundreds of people'll see you 
                         and ...

                                     GIRL
                              (cutting in)
                         I'm not...

                                     PAUL
                         Oh, you're the understudy, sort of 
                         thing?

                                     GIRL
                         No.
                              (aggressively)
                         I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. 
                         I just felt like doing those lines.

                                     PAUL
                         Oh, I see. You are an actress though, 
                         aren't you?

                                     GIRL
                         Yes.

                                     PAUL
                         Aye, I knew you were.

                                     GIRL
                         What's that mean?

                                     PAUL
                         Well, the way you were spouting, 
                         like....
                              (he imitates her)
                         "I don't believe you, sir..." and 
                         all that. Yeah, it was gear.

                                     GIRL
                              (dryly)
                         The big hammer?

                                     PAUL
                              (smiling)
                         Oh aye, a sledge.

                                     GIRL
                         But the way you did it then sounded 
                         so phony.

                                     PAUL
                         No... I wouldn't say that... just 
                         like an actress... you know.

               He moves and stands about like an actress.

                                     GIRL
                         But that's not like a real person at 
                         all.

                                     PAUL
                         Aye well, actresses aren't like real 
                         people, are they?

                                     GIRL
                         They ought to be.

                                     PAUL
                         Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they 
                         never are, are they?

                                     GIRL
                              (teasingly)
                         What are you?

                                     PAUL
                         I'm in a group... well... there are 
                         four of us, we play and sing.

                                     GIRL
                         I bet you don't sound like real 
                         people.

                                     PAUL
                         We do, you know. We sound like us 
                         having a ball. It's fab.

                                     GIRL
                         Is it really fab or are you just 
                         saying that to convince yourself?

                                     PAUL
                         What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless 
                         I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get 
                         paid for doing something I love doing.

               He laughs and with a gesture takes in the whole studio

                                     PAUL
                         ...all this and a jam butty too!!

                                     GIRL
                         I only enjoy acting for myself. I 
                         hate it when other people are let 
                         in.

                                     PAUL
                         Why? I mean, which are you, scared 
                         or selfish?

                                     GIRL
                         Why selfish?

                                     PAUL
                         Well, you've got to have people to 
                         taste your treacle toffee.

               She looks at him in surprise.

                                     PAUL
                         No, hang on, I've not gone daft. You 
                         see, when I was little me mother let 
                         me make some treacle toffee one time 
                         in our back scullery. When I'd done 
                         she said to me, "Go and give some to 
                         the other kids." So, I said I would 
                         but I thought to meself, "She must 
                         think I'm soft." Anyroad, I was eating 
                         away there but I wanted somebody 
                         else to know how good it was so in 
                         the end I wound up giving it all 
                         away... but I didn't mind, mind, 
                         'cos I'd made the stuff in the first 
                         place. Well... that's why you need 
                         other people... an audience... to 
                         taste your treacle toffee, like. 
                         Eh... does that sound as thickheaded 
                         to you as it does to me?

                                     GIRL
                         Not really but I'm probably not a 
                         toffee maker. How would you do those 
                         lines of mine?

                                     PAUL
                         Well, look at it this way, I mean, 
                         when you come right down to it, that 
                         girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, 
                         isn't she?

                                     GIRL
                         Is she?

                                     PAUL
                         Of course... Look, if she was a 
                         Liverpool scrubber...
                              (Paul starts acting a 
                              Liverpool girl, he 
                              minces about then 
                              turns, extending his 
                              leg)
                         Eh, fella, you want to try pulling 
                         the other one, it's got a full set 
                         of bells hanging off it... Y'what?... 
                         I know your sort, two cokes and a 
                         packet of cheese and onion crisps 
                         and suddenly it's love and we're 
                         stopping in an empty shop doorway. 
                         You're just after me body and y'can't 
                         have it... so there!!

                                     GIRL
                              (shattered)
                         And you honestly think that's what 
                         she meant?

                                     PAUL
                         Oh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, 
                         she's trying to get him to marry her 
                         but he doesn't want... well... I 
                         don't reckon any fella's ever wanted 
                         to get married. But girls are like 
                         that, clever and cunning. You've got 
                         to laugh.

               He laughs.

                                     GIRL
                         Well, it's nice to know you think 
                         we're clever.

                                     PAUL
                              (grinning)
                         And cunning.

                                     GIRL
                         And what do you do about it?

                                     PAUL
                         Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm 
                         always running about with the lads... 
                         no, we don't have the time.

                                     GIRL
                         Pity.

                                     PAUL
                              (not noticing the 
                              invitation)
                         Aye, it is but as long as you get 
                         by, it's all right, you know... bash 
                         on, happy valley's when they let you 
                         stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.

                                     GIRL
                         Yes.

                                     PAUL
                              (going)
                         See you.

                                     GIRL
                         Of course.

               PAUL stands at the doorway, shrugs then goes out.

               EXTERIOR  STREET

               In the street, workmen are collecting shovels, drinking tea 
               and doing all the things people do around building sites. 
               RINGO mooches around.

               In the road is a hole with a diameter of about 3 feet, and 
               at least 6 feet deep. RINGO looks down and a man is busily 
               working at the bottom of the hole. He glares at RINGO. After 
               a moment RINGO turns away. We now see a very elegant young 
               lady coming towards RINGO. She is daintily avoiding a series 
               of puddles. RINGO has an idea and does a Sir Walter Raleigh 
               with his large Mac spreading it over one of the puddles. The 
               girl walks across it smiling graciously. RINGO proceeds with 
               the coat to the next puddle and to the next backing gradually 
               towards the hole.

               At last he spreads the coat, without noticing what he is 
               doing, over the hole. The girl steps onto the coat and 
               disappears sharply. RINGO looks down the hole where the girl 
               is held in the workman's arms. The workman rises out of the 
               manhole until he is waist height. At this point an elegantly 
               dressed gentleman appears (the girl's husband) he looks at 
               his wife in the workman's arms and hits the workman. RINGO 
               backs away through the puddles, and is nicked by the 
               POLICEMAN.

               INTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE  NEAR STAGE DOOR

               The DIRECTOR is pacing up and down the corridor. NORM is 
               also walking up and down, SHAKE is leaning against the wall 
               quite unconcerned. NORM gives SHAKE a push.

                                     NORM
                         Worry, will you!

               SHAKE adjusts his features to a worrying expression.

                                     DIRECTOR
                              (bitterly)
                         Well, that's it, two minutes to the 
                         final run-through... they're bound 
                         to miss it...

                                     NORM
                         I'll murder that Lennon.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         But I suppose we can survive a missed 
                         run-through as long...

                                     SHAKE
                         ...as they head up for the show. Oh 
                         yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to 
                         miss the show, wouldn't it like.

                                     NORM
                         Shurrup, cheerful.

               The horrible prospect hits the DIRECTOR.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         You don't think...

                                     NORM
                              (reassuring him)
                         They'll be here.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Oh now, they can't do that to me.
                              (turning on Norm)
                         It's all your fault.
                              (overriding Norm)
                         Oh yes it is and if they don't turn 
                         up I wouldn't be in your shoes for 
                         all the...

                                     SHAKE
                              (helping out)
                         ...tea in China. Oh you're right, 
                         neither would I.

               He steps away from NORM and stands near the DIRECTOR.

                                     NORM
                         Traitor!

               SHAKE nods his agreement to this assessment of his character.

                                     SHAKE
                         Of course.

               At this moment JOHN, GEORGE and PAUL enter from the stage 
               door. They are completely unconcerned and walk past the 
               DIRECTOR, SHAKE and NORM.

                                     JOHN
                              (as he passes by)
                         Hi Norm!

                                     NORM
                              (preoccupied)
                         Hi, our lot!

               The BOYS walk on when after a moment NORM snaps to.

                                     NORM
                         Our lot!

                                     GEORGE
                              (mildly)
                         Did you want something.

                                     NORM
                              (beaming with delight)
                         I could eat the lot of you.

                                     JOHN
                         You'd look gear with an apple in 
                         your gob.

                                     DIRECTOR
                              (accusingly)
                         Do you realise you could have missed 
                         the final run-through?

                                     GEORGE
                         Sorry.

                                     SHAKE
                         Eh, there's only three of them.

                                     PAUL
                         Aye, we were looking for Ringo. But 
                         we realised he must have come back.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Do you realise we are on the air, 
                         live, in front of an audience, in 
                         forty-five minutes and you're one 
                         short.

                                     JOHN
                         Control yourself or you'll spurt. 
                         He's bound to be somewhere.

                                     NORM
                         Aye, let's try the dressing room.

               Everyone starts along the passage. NORM and PAUL last.

                                     PAUL
                         Eh, where's my grandfather?

                                     NORM
                         Don't worry about him. He can look 
                         after himself.

                                     PAUL
                         Aye, I suppose so.

               They run after the others.

               EXTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE  CLOSE-UP

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Here they are, personally signed and 
                         handwritten by your own sweet boys. 
                         The chance of a lifetime. Be the 
                         envy of your less fortunate sisters!

               The CAMERA PULLS back and we see GRANDFATHER is surrounded 
               by girls who have broken from the queue and are doing a brisk 
               trade with the old man. He has a large sign on which is 
               written: "Get your genuine autographed Beatles photographs." 
               On the edge of the crowd two POLICEMEN are trying to force 
               the girls back into the queue. Finally they wade through the 
               girls and confront GRANDFATHER. They look at the old man 
               quizzically; he stares back coldly. They indicate he should 
               hop it and quick but GRANDFATHER defiantly glares back at 
               them. So with a sigh, they grab an arm each and escort the 
               old man off.

               INTERIOR  POLICE STATION

               It is the reception desk and behind it is the DESK SERGEANT. 
               After a moment RINGO is dragged in by the POLICEMAN we saw 
               him with before.

                                     RINGO
                         Look, I'm Ringo Starr... I've got a 
                         show to do in a few minutes you've 
                         got to let me go... I'm Ringo...

                                     POLICEMAN
                         Sure, they all say that these days... 
                         Anyway... I don't care who you are... 
                         you can save that for the stipendary. 
                         Here you are, Sarge.

                                     SERGEANT
                         What is he?

                                     POLICEMAN
                              (reeling off the list)
                         I've got a little list here. Wandering 
                         abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in 
                         a suspicious manner. Conduct liable 
                         to cause a breach of the peace. You 
                         name it, he's done it.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Oh, a little savage, is he?

                                     POLICEMAN
                         A proper Aborigine.

                                     RINGO
                              (on his dignity)
                         I demand to see me solicitor.

                                     SERGEANT
                         What's his name?

                                     RINGO
                         Oh, well if you're going to get 
                         technical --

               At that moment there is a loud series of noises off camera, 
               furious shouting and dull crashes of wood.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Hello, it's going to be one of those 
                         nights, is it?
                              (to policeman)
                         Sit Charley Peace down over there.

               The POLICEMAN takes RINGO to a bench and sits him down as 
               GRANDFATHER and the two POLICEMEN who were with him enter. 
               The sign is tattered and is being lugged after them.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Well, you got me here so do your 
                         worst but I'll take one of you with 
                         me.
                              (kicks the nearest 
                              policeman)
                         Oh, I know your game, get me in the 
                         tiled room and out come the rubber 
                         hoses but I'll defy you still.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Is there a fire, then?

               GRANDFATHER leans across the desk and hisses at the SERGEANT.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         You ugly, great brute you, you have 
                         sadism stamped all over your bloated 
                         British kisser.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Eh?

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         I'll go on a hunger strike. I know 
                         your caper.

               The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and 
               the size twelve boot ankle-tap.

                                     SERGEANT
                         What's he on about?

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (squaring up)
                         I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll 
                         need the mahogany truncheon for this 
                         boyo. A nation once again.

                                     SERGEANT
                              (to policemen)
                         Get Lloyd George over there with 
                         that mechanic in the cloth cap while 
                         I sort this lot out.

               The POLICEMEN hurtle GRANDFATHER firmly but gently over to 
               the bench on which RINGO is sitting and then return to the 
               desk for a whispered conference with the SERGEANT. Meanwhile 
               in full conspiratorial fashion GRANDFATHER talks to RINGO 
               out of the side of his mouth.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed 
                         yer leg for the iron too, did they?

                                     RINGO
                         Well I'm not exactly a voluntary 
                         patient.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?

                                     RINGO
                         What?

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (whispering)
                         Keep your voice down, this lot'll 
                         paste you, just for the exercise. Oh 
                         they're a desperate crew of drippings 
                         and they've fists like matured hams 
                         for pounding defenceless lads like 
                         you.

                                     RINGO
                              (disturbed)
                         Have they?

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         That sergeant's a body-blow veteran 
                         if ever I measured one. One of us 
                         has got to escape. I'll get the boys. 
                         Hold on son, I'll be back for you.

                                     RINGO
                              (horrified)
                         Me!

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         And if they get you on the floor 
                         watch out for your brisket.

                                     RINGO
                              (hopefully)
                         Oh, they seem all right to me.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         That's what they want you to think. 
                         All coppers are villains.

                                     SERGEANT
                              (calling)
                         Would you two like a cup of tea?

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         You see, sly villains.

                                     RINGO
                              (miserable)
                         No thanks, Mr. Sergeant, sir.

               We now have a CLOSE SHOT of POLICEMEN around the sergeant's 
               desk.

                                     SERGEANT
                         So you just brought the old chap out 
                         of the crowd for his own good.

                                     POLICEMAN
                         Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing 
                         him to the station.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Well, he can't stop here.

               Shot of GRANDFATHER watching POLICEMEN intently and muttering 
               words as he does.

                                     RINGO
                         What are you doing?

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Lip reading.

                                     RINGO
                         What are they saying?

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Nothing good.

               The POLICEMEN make a move towards GRANDFATHER and RINGO.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Well son, it's now or never.

               He jumps to his feet and scurries towards the door.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         All right, you paid assassins. Johnny 
                         McCartney'll give you a run for your 
                         threepence ha'penny.

               He dashes out of the door followed by the POLICEMAN who has 
               his pile of photos.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Now, what's he up to?

                                     RINGO
                         He's allergic to Bobbies, especially 
                         English Bobbies.

               The POLICEMAN with the photos returns.

                                     POLICEMAN
                              (Irish accent)
                         Your man disappeared like a leveret 
                         over a hill.

                                     RINGO
                         Turncoat!

               The POLICEMEN turn on RINGO and walk towards him.

               CLOSE-UP  RINGO

                                     RINGO
                         Mother!

               EXTERIOR  STREET

               GRANDFATHER is running at top speed down the street. He is 
               breathing heavily and runs as if pursued by the hounds of 
               hell. The street however is entirely empty and no one is 
               even in sight. As he reaches the top of the street he pauses 
               and turning, looks around him. From his P.O.V. we see just 
               how empty the street is and heaving a sigh of relief 
               GRANDFATHER cackles to himself. His triumph is short lived. 
               At this precise moment down the street comes a parade of 
               police vehicles, a Black Maria, an escorting police motor 
               bike patrol and an ordinary squad car. The procession draws 
               up and the street is full of policemen getting out of the 
               Black Maria and squad car and off motor bikes.

               CLOSE-UP  GRANDFATHER's horrified face.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Be God, they've called up 
                         reinforcements, the dragnet's out!

               He dashes off wildly in the general direction of the theatre. 
               He has been completely unnoticed by the policemen who are 
               lining up for a last minute inspection by the inspector in 
               charge. The inspector is like a commander-in-chief of a spear-
               head attack force.

               They smartly march off in the direction taken by GRANDFATHER.

                                     DIRECTOR
                              (watching the clock)
                         Only half an hour and you're on!

                                     GEORGE
                         Can I say something?

               The director clutches at any straw.

                                     DIRECTOR
                              (hopefully)
                         Yes, anything.

                                     GEORGE
                              (earnestly)
                         It's highly unlikely we'll be on... 
                         I mean the law of averages are against 
                         you and it seems that, etc., etc....

               But his speech is drowned by the pitiful moans of the 
               DIRECTOR.

               EXTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE  STAGE DOOR

               The four little boys from the canal are being driven away by 
               the security guard.

                                     GUARD
                              (going back into 
                              theatre)
                         I'll have the hides off of you lot.

               The kids retreat as GRANDFATHER pants into shot, ignoring 
               the kids he enters the stage door but in a second he is out 
               again, grasped firmly by the collar by the security guard.

                                     GUARD
                         You ought to be ashamed of yourself. 
                         Go home!

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         I must see Pauly.

                                     GUARD
                         Go home then and see him on the telly.

               The GUARD re-enters the stage door.

               GRANDFATHER looks around him and sees the four kids. He 
               hustles over and after a whispered conference we hear his 
               offer.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Can you fix him for me?

                                     BOYS
                         Yeah.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Sixpence.

                                     BOY
                         Each?

               GRANDFATHER is about to argue.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Oh, all right.

                                     BOY
                         And in advance.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (disgusted)
                         Mercenary!

               But he hands over the money. The kids rush in the stage door 
               and after a moment the furious GUARD chases them out and 
               down the alley.

               GRANDFATHER, chuckling, nips in the door.

               INTERIOR  T.V. CONTROL ROOM  ON STAGE

               GRANDFATHER is being chased by several studio attendants; he 
               is dodging behind equipment. He finally gets on a sound boom 
               trolley and uses it as a weapon to keep his pursuers at bay.

               INTERIOR  T.V. CONTROL ROOM

               The DIRECTOR, BOYS, and NORM and SHAKE see GRANDFATHER on 
               the monitors.

               They dash out of the room and on to the stage.

                                     DIRECTOR
                              (shouting)
                         It's all right, leave him alone.

                         The police have the poor unfortunate 
                         lad in the Bridewell.

                                     BOYS
                         The police station.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         He'll be pulp by now.

                         What are we waiting for?

                                     GEORGE
                         Come here.

               PAUL, JOHN and GEORGE rush off.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         We've only got twenty minutes.

               EXTERIOR  STREET OUTSIDE POLICE STATION

               PAUL, JOHN and GEORGE come running down the street in single 
               file, their knees  high in the air, they skid to a halt at 
               the police station and without pausing they dash inside. 
               After a moment they reappear -- only this time RINGO is behind 
               them. They dash off down the street.

               They are followed at once by ten POLICEMEN also in single 
               file. They are also pounding along knees high in the air. 
               The BOYS and the coppers disappear around the corner. At 
               once, they reappear from the other direction, then run down 
               the street still followed by the policemen.

               When they reach the police station another group of police 
               bars their way so they are forced to run up the stairs and 
               inside.

               INTERIOR  POLICE STATION

               The DESK SERGEANT is standing behind his desk looking very 
               surprised.

               At this moment the boys run in and stand panting in front of 
               the desk.

               Before the SERGEANT can start speaking the pursuing POLICEMEN 
               arrive.

               They, too, are out of breath.

                                     SERGEANT
                         What is all this?

                                     JOHN
                              (heaving and panting)
                         Hold on until we get our breath.

               The BOYS and POLICEMEN pant on until JOHN seems to have 
               recovered.

                                     SERGEANT
                         All right now?

                                     JOHN
                         Sure.
                              (to boys)
                         Ready?

               The BOYS nod and without further ado they turn and run through 
               the surprised rank of POLICEMEN and out into the street.

               EXTERIOR  STREET

               THE CHASE CARRIES ON.

               Shots of BOYS being pursued (still in single file) by police, 
               including the sergeant with one shot where the BOYS are 
               chasing the POLICEMEN.

               Finally, as they approach the theatre, they are seen by the 
               girl fans who swarm around the police, over running them. 
               The boys grin to each other and are about to make off when 
               from their P.O.V. we see the INSPECTOR and POLICEMEN blocking 
               it.

                                     JOHN
                         Ah well, it was worth a try.

                              (calling to Sergeant)
                         What do you think you're up to?

                                     SERGEANT
                         Arrest those boys, sir.

                                     INSPECTOR
                         That's all we need to start a real 
                         riot!
                              (to Boys)
                         Come on lads, they're waiting for 
                         you.

               INTERIOR  THEATRE BACKSTAGE

               The Inspector now hustles the BOYS through the crowds and in 
               through the main entrance of the theatre where SHAKE and 
               NORM are waiting. NORM looks suspiciously at RINGO who is 
               still wearing his cap. RINGO whips it off and NORM delightedly 
               hugs him. The BOYS dash through the stalls entrance and on 
               stage. The DIRECTOR sees them and bursts into tears with 
               relief. NORM hustles the lads into the wings to be changed 
               into their show costumes. All around them last-minute 
               preparations are going on.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Boys, you don't know what this means 
                         to me. If you hadn't come back it 
                         would have been the epilogue or the 
                         news in Welsh for life.

                                     NORM
                         Aren't you supposed to be in that 
                         box?

               The DIRECTOR gives NORM a final glare and dashes off.

                                     PAUL
                         And another thing, where's that old 
                         mixer?

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Here, Pauly.

               And sitting on a box sadly chastened sits GRANDFATHER.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, I got a few things to say to 
                         you, two-faced John McCartney.

                                     JOHN
                         Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, 
                         isn't he? And it's not his fault 
                         he's old.

                                     PAUL
                              (hotly)
                         What's old got to do with it?

                                     JOHN
                         You needn't bother.

                                     PAUL
                         Y'what?

                                     JOHN
                         Practising to be thick-headed, you're 
                         there already.

                                     PAUL
                         Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!

                                     JOHN
                         That's right, but he's only asking 
                         us to pay attention to him, aren't 
                         you?

               From JOHN's P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER. He looks what he is, 
               a tired old man.

                                     JOHN
                         You see.
                              (to Grandad)
                         You know your trouble -- you should 
                         have gone West to America. You'd 
                         have wound up a Senior Citizen of 
                         Boston. As it is you took the wrong 
                         turning and what happened, you're a 
                         lonely old man from Liverpool.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (fighting back)
                         But I'm clean.

               The BOYS giggle and slap him on the back.

               INTERIOR  TV THEATRE AUDITORIUM

               We see the audience of girls streaming in and settling down 
               in their places for the show. There is the usual business of 
               getting the show ready and we see SHOTS of the girls' faces, 
               then JOHN, PAUL, RINGO and GEORGE looking at them. At last 
               on cue from the floor manager the BOYS start their act to 
               the audience's screams.

               During the number we constantly CUT away to the audience 
               with various SHOTS of the ecstatic girls. In the middle of 
               these shots we see NORM standing at the side of the audience 
               his face glowing with satisfaction. We follow his gaze and 
               from NORM'S P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER handcuffed to SHAKE, 
               but in spite of this, the old man is enjoying himself.

               The BOYS now perform a medley of numbers, i.e., a little of 
               all the songs we have heard during the story. This gives the 
               impression of a full set and we finish after their bows. 
               While they are doing so they look again in the general 
               direction of SHAKE and GRANDFATHER and from their P.O.V., we 
               see SHAKE is beating time to the music but from his wrist 
               dangles an empty set of handcuffs. GRANDFATHER has gone again. 

               As the BOYS are reacting to GRANDFATHER's disappearance once 
               again, the trap door on the stage opens and GRANDFATHER 
               appears in the centre of the group as they finish their act 
               and take their final bows.

               INTERIOR  STUDIO CORRIDOR

               NORM is waiting for the boys. With him are two studio 
               attendants carrying the boys' luggage. As the BOYS excitedly 
               appear he speaks to them.

                                     NORM
                         I've got the stuff. Come here.

                                     PAUL
                         Aren't we...

                                     NORM
                         No, we're not!

               He hurries them along.

                                     NORM
                         The office was on the phone, they 
                         think it'd be better if we pushed 
                         straight to Wolverhampton.

                                     JOHN
                         Tonight? We can't make it...

                                     NORM
                         You've got a midnight matinee.

                                     JOHN
                         Now, look here, Norm...

                                     NORM
                         No, you look here, John. I've only 
                         one thing to say to you.

                                     JOHN
                         What?

                                     NORM
                         You're a swine. So hurry up... we're 
                         travelling!

               NORM turns down a side exit where the door is open to the 
               field. In it is an eight-passenger helicopter.

               EXTERIOR  STAGE DOOR  T.V. THEATRE

               The BOYS and NORM come out of the building and start to run 
               towards the helicopter.

                                     PAUL
                              (looking behind him)
                         Where's my grandfather?

                                     NORM
                              (arriving at helicopter 
                              door)
                         Don't start. Look.

               The boys look in the passenger bay and there is GRANDFATHER. 
               He is still handcuffed to SHAKE but clutching his pile of 
               photos.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (beckoning them in 
                              with his free hand 
                              which holds the photos)
                         Come on, you're hanging up the parade.

               The boys shout "Get rid of those things, etc."

               EXTERIOR  FIELD

               The final shot is of the helicopter rising up (SHOT FROM 
               BELOW). As it disappears, a shower of photos come from its 
               window.

               We cut to a CLOSE-UP of one signed photo as it hits the ground 
               and SUPER the closing credits over it.

                                         THE END
