                                   by
     
                              Andrew Niccol
     
     
     
     
     ----------------------------------------------------------------
     
     FADE IN:
     
     ON BRIGHT, OUT-OF-FOCUS, OVAL-SHAPED COLORS.
     
     The colored shapes dart around the screen -- the impression
     of looking through a kaleidoscope.
     
     As the image comes into sharp focus, we discover that we are
     inside a CANDY BOWL.  A MAN'S FINGERS are frantically
     removing all the cherry-flavored pieces of candy.
     
     EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY
     
     The man performing this curious task is
     writer/producer/director, VIKTOR TARANSKY, forties,
     conservatively dressed in suit and tie.  He sits alone at an
     empty craft service table outside a cavernous soundstage,
     some distance from the rest of the film set -- a breeze blows
     the table's paper cloth.
     
     Viktor finishes sorting.  Finding no trash can to deposit the
     rejected cherry candy, he scoops them into his pocket.
     
     A young headset-clad P.A. hurriedly approaches.  He looks
     ill.
     
                         P.A.
               Mr. Taransky --
     
     Viktor reads the young P.A.'s panicked expression.
     
                         VIKTOR
               She's walking?... Don't tell me
               she's walking.
                   (blood slowly draining
                    from his face)
               She is not walking... She can't
               walk.
     
     EXT.  TRAILER - DAY
     
     NICOLA ANDERS, twenty-something, A-list actress, beautiful
     face scowling, is supervising her ASSISTANT ferrying clothes
     from a movie trailer to a limousine.  VIKTOR desperately
     follows after Nicola.
     
                         VIKTOR
               -- Nicola!  How was your massage?
     
                         NICOLA
               You're in breach.
     
                         VIKTOR
               -- Is this about the new pages? --
               I made the changes you wanted,
               you're in virtually every scene --
     
                         NICOLA
                   (wheeling on him)
               It's not the size of the role,
               Viktor.
                   (suddenly very cool)
               Am I or am I not contractually
               entitled to the biggest trailer on
               the set?
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (regarding the enormous
                    silver fish behind them,
                    confused)
               It's the biggest on earth!  I
               swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream --
               they don't make them any longer
               than that.
     
                         NICOLA
               Taller, Viktor.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Taller?  What?
     
     Viktor looks up in horror.  The trailer next to Nicola's does
     indeed appear to be fractionally taller.
     
                         NICOLA
                   (walking away)
               You've insulted me for the last
               time.
     
     Viktor looks to the tires.  His face suddenly brightens.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Nicola, it's just the tires --
               they're over-inflated!  I can fix
               it!
     
     Viktor grasps the air nozzle on a tire and begins desperately
     stabbing at it with a ballpoint pen.  Air hisses out.
     
                         VIKTOR
               See, it's lower already.
     
     Nicola ignores Viktor, marching towards her limo with her
     PUBLICIST.  Abandoning the trailer, Viktor hurries after her.
     
                         VIKTOR
               I beg you.  You can't do this to
               me.
     
                         NICOLA
                   (looking back)
               I had three other offers.  I only
               signed on to this picture out of...
               loyalty.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Then show some.  They'll shut me
               down!
     
                         NICOLA
                   (opening the car door)
               It wasn't working anyhow.  The
               scene with the thousand geese -- I
               don't understand this film.  I
               don't think anyone will understand
               it.  I already put out a press
               release -- citing "creative
               differences".
     
     Viktor stops, nods resignedly -- suddenly very calm.
     
                         VIKTOR
               You know what, Nicola, you're
               right.
                   (picking up her last piece
                    of luggage)
               Here, let me help you with that.
                   (holding the door for her)
               You ought to go.  The truth is I
               don't deserve you.  This film
               doesn't deserve you.  Frankly, it
               deserves much, much better.  The
               reason it's not working is because
               you're not about the work.
     
     Nicola is stunned.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (to the limo driver)
               To Hell, please.
     
     The door slams and the limo roars away.  Viktor looks to the
     still hissing trailer tire.  The CREW regards Viktor
     apprehensively.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (to the crew)
               What are you looking at?  Get back
               to work.
     
     The crew is uncertain what work there is to do.
     
     INT.  BEDROOM - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - NIGHT
     
     In an ornate bedroom, NICOLA lies on her death bed under a
     veil of netting.  A distraught man, HAL, sits close by.
     
                         NICOLA
                   (whispered)
               Jack... are you there?
     
                         HAL
               I'm here.  I'm right beside you.
     
     A NUN enters.
     
                         NUN
                   (to Hal)
               You should really go now.
     
                         NICOLA
               No, it's alright.  Please, let him
               stay.
     
     The nun withdraws.  Hal holds his face in his hands, almost
     breaking down.
     
                         HAL
                   (a glance to heaven)
               What kind of cruel God is it that
               would take you away from me?
     
                         NICOLA
               The same one who brought me to you.
     
                         HAL
               No... I cannot accept it.  If
               something like this can happen. 
               What...
                   (struggling to find the
                    words)
               What is it for?
     
                         NICOLA
                   (smiles through her pain)
               -- Why are we here?  Is that what
               you're asking, Jack?... Why are we
               here?  No why.  Just here.
     
     Nicola dies peacefully.
     
     INT.  SCREENING ROOM - STUDIO - DAY
     
     VIKTOR sits with leading man HAL, THREE EXECUTIVES and studio
     head ELAINE CHRISTIAN, watching a rough assembly of the film. 
     It ends with a close up of NICOLA ANDERS.
     
     The lights go up.  The image of Nicola fades off the screen.
     
                         EXECUTIVE 1
               She's good.  You can hardly tell
               she's reading off a teleprompter.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (ignoring him)
               I've analyzed the footage.  We've
               got almost everything we need in
               the can.  If we rework the script,
               we can finish the film without her.
     
                         EXECUTIVE 2
                   (forceful shake of the
                    head)
               According to the writ her attorneys
               filed at noon today.  They'll sue
               if the film is released with Nicola
               in a single frame.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (more anxious)
               So we'll re-cast.
     
                         HAL
               Nicola Anders is the only actress
               who can play that role.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (incredulous)
               It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not
               bigger than this picture.
     
     Elaine finally speaks up.
     
                         ELAINE
               Of course she is.  No other name is
               going to sign on now and risk
               offending her.
     
                         VIKTOR
               We don't need a name.  We'll cast
               an unknown.
     
                         HAL
               I won't play opposite an unknown.
     
                         ELAINE
               We can't sell an unknown.  Nicola's
               soured on the project and we have
               to accept that.  If we ever want to
               be in the Nicola Anders business
               again, we have to cut our losses
               and shelve the picture.
     
     The executives, leading man and director nod sagely.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (aghast)
               No!  You will not give in to that
               blackmailing bitch!
     
                         ELAINE
                   (a wince, addressing
                    everyone but Viktor)
               Excuse us.
     
     Elaine ushers Viktor out of the screening room.
     
     EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY
     
     ELAINE and VIKTOR talk in the shadow of an enormous
     soundstage.  They speak more freely in each other's company.
     
                         ELAINE
               God, Viktor.  Why do you always
               have to make things so difficult
               for yourself?
     
                         VIKTOR
               Difficult.  I'm difficult.
     
     He produces a handful of candy from his pocket.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (referring to the candy)
               -- Do you know what these are,
               Elaine?
     
                         ELAINE
                   (talking a piece of candy
                    and eating it)
               Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry
               Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I,
               Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy
               Award nominated director --
     
                         ELAINE
               -- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
     
                         VIKTOR
               -- overseeing the most cherished
               movie project of my career, am
               walking around with a pocketful of
               cherry Mike & Ike's?
     
     Elaine takes a seat in a nearby studio cart as Viktor paces.
     
                         ELAINE
               -- I have a feeling you're going to
               tell me.
     
                         VIKTOR
               -- I'll tell you why.  It is
               because Miss Nicola Anders,
               supermodel with a SAG card God's
               gift to cinema, has it written into
               her contract that all cherry Mike &
               Ike's be removed from her candy
               dish along with strict instructions
               that any room she walks into should
               have seven packs of cigarettes
               waiting for her three of them
               opened, that there be a personal
               jacuzzi within eighty paces of her
               dressing room, and that any time
               she travels, her nanny must fly
               with her first class.
     
                         ELAINE
               -- What's wrong with that?
     
                         VIKTOR
               Elaine, she doesn't have any
               children!
                   (grabbing her arm)
               Don't you see?  We're being held
               hostage by 12 men and 5 women who
               someone somewhere has decreed are
               the A-list.
     
                         ELAINE
               The public decides who's on that
               list.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Please.
     
                         ELAINE
               It's the truth.  Those 17
               superstars are our insurance
               policy.  We can't open -- can't
               make a profit without them.
     
                         VIKTOR
               We can hardly make a profit with
               them.  Up-front salary, back-end
               deal, perks, per diem, percentages 
               -- They're mocking us, Elaine. 
               We're at their mercy.
                   (staring wistful, into
                    space)
               We always had movie stars but they
               used to be our stars.  We used to
               decide who would play what role. 
               We told them what to wear, what to
               say, who to date.  When they were
               under contract, we could change
               their names if we wanted to -- more
               than once!
     
                         ELAINE
                   (regarding him as if he's
                    insane)
               You realize you're nostalgic for an
               era you weren't even born in?
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (irritated at her
                    infuriating logic)
               Well, I do remember why I started
               out in this business -- you seem to
               have forgotten -- working in New
               York with Cassevetes -- we were
               trying to do something important,
               shine a light in that darkened
               cinema --
     
                         ELAINE
                   (rolling her eyes)
               -- It's called a projector.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (ignoring her)
               -- Illuminate hearts and minds with
               a ray of truth.
     
                         ELAINE
               Listen, Viktor, I have good
               memories of those days too -- but
               this isn't about that or you or me
               or some high-minded ideal.  This is
               business.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Spare me.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (gesturing at the studio
                    lot)
               -- Christ, Viktor, look around. 
               What do you think pays for all
               this?  This is about investment and
               return.  Those days in New York...
               that's... it's over.
     
     A pause.  Viktor reads Elaine's face.
     
                         VIKTOR
               You're not renewing my contract.
     
                         ELAINE
               How can I?  Your last three
               pictures tanked.  The board is
               giving me hell.  No bankable star
               will work with you after this.  If
               you just compromised... a little.
     
     Viktor eats some of the candy in his hand as he takes in the
     news.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (rueful smile)
               -- Well, it's not every day you're
               fired by the mother of your own
               child.
     
     Elaine also eats some more candy -- a curiously intimate
     moment between them.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (softening, a heart-to
                    heart)
               I'm not taking away your daughter,
               just your deal.  You and I both
               know, after the divorce I kept you
               on for old time's sake, so you
               could still hold your head up in
               front of Lainey.  I called what's
               his name at Warner's.  He said he'd
               take a meeting -- in July.  I've
               fought for you Viktor...
                   (voice trails off)
               You want to talk severance?
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (staring off into the
                    distance, face hardening)
               You can have everything -- office,
               car, assistants -- all I want is
               the picture.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (confused)
               The picture's dead.
     
                         VIKTOR
               So there's no problem -- I can have
               the rights, the negative too?
     
                         ELAINE
                   (believing she's getting
                    off lightly)
               They're yours.  But how are you
               going to finish it?  Without a star
               there's no movie.
     
                         VIKTOR
               I don't need a star.  All I need is
               an actor -- I'll reshoot the part,
               cut out Nicola and replace her with
               a real actor.  A real leading lady.
     
                         ELAINE
               Even if you find her, you know the
               problem with unknowns, Viktor.  If
               they're good, they get known.  And
               then you're back to sorting their
               candy... and worse.
                   (kissing him on the cheek
                    as she departs in her
                    studio golf cart)
               I'm sorry, Viktor.
     
     Viktor watches her depart down the canyon of stages, left
     alone on the deserted lot.
     
     EXT.  STUDIO ENTRANCE - DUSK
     
     Twenty NICOLA ANDERS' FACES jiggle into frame.  VIKTOR's face
     appears amongst them.
     
     They are cardboard figures, standing together in the trailer
     of an electric cart.  A WORKMAN is collecting the promotional
     standees from around the lot.
     
     VIKTOR places his hands on the neck of a cardboard cut-out --
     we sense he is about to rip her head off -- when a fourteen
     year old girl, LAINEY, appears beside him, carrying a laptop
     computer.
     
                         LAINEY
               Hi, Dad.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (slightly ashamed)
               Hello, sweetheart.
     
     Viktor, embarrassed by his childishness, steps aside for the
     suspicious workman who carries the standee away.
     
     Lainey smiles sweetly.  She hugs him.
     
                         LAINEY
               I'm sorry Mom canned you.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (shrugging)
               It's really... not anything,
               Lainey.  It's just --
     
                         LAINEY
               Don't feel too bad.
                   (glancing to a standee)
               Mom runs the place and they still
               walk all over her.  You're better
               off out of it.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (regarding his daughter)
               You look very grown up.  What are
               you doing?  You meeting your mom
               for dinner?
     
     She glances towards the entrance where Lainey's mother,
     ELAINE, and her dependable, uncomplicated businessman
     boyfriend, KENT, wait beside Elaine's car.
     
                         LAINEY
                   (reluctant admission)
               Kent got tickets to the ballet.
     
     Viktor shakes the idea of Kent and Elaine from his head.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (trying to convince
                    himself as much as
                    Lainey)
               I'm going to finish the picture,
               sweetheart.  It's important.
     
                         LAINEY
                   (not quite convinced)
               I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're
               Viktor Taransky.
     
     Lainey kisses the forlorn Viktor goodbye.  She runs to her
     mother and Kent.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (to himself)
               That's right.  I'm Viktor Taransky.
     
     EXT.  STUDIO BUILDING - SOME DISTANCE AWAY - DUSK
     
     From a distance ELAINE and KENT regard the lonely figure of
     VIKTOR.
     
                         KENT
               You had no choice, Elaine.  He's a
               liability.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (wistful look to Viktor)
               He also happens to be the most
               talented man I've ever known.
     
     Elaine climbs in the car as Lainey approaches.

     Differences"
     
     The man reading the trade paper sits in the back of a tram on
     a studio tour -- HANK ALENO.  He wears a pair of spectacles
     with one lens blacked out, his head tilted on one side.  It
     is an item buried on the inside pages that catches Hank's one
     good eye.

               And coming up on your right --
     
     When the tram departs, we discover that Hank has exited the
     tram and is hiding in the facade of a New York subway
     entrance.  The tag around his neck reads, "VISITOR -- Stay
     With The Tour".
     
     EXT.  STUDIO GATE - NIGHT
     
     VIKTOR wheels a stack of film cans on a dolly while holding
     several framed black and white photographs of screen legends
     under his arm.
     
     HANK, hiding in the shadows of the soundstages, spies Viktor.
     He hurries towards him as Viktor approaches his antiquated
     Bentley.

                    cans as a barrier)
               -- Please, get away from me.
     
                         HANK
               I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked
               skin.  I licked hair.  I licked
               every part of her.

                    he is dealing with a
                    pervert)

                   (regarding the article)
               I was misquoted.

                    his pocket)

     Viktor takes a step back, concerned once again about the
     man's motives.
     
                         HANK
                   (trying to reassure)

               Don't be.  It was worth it.
     
     Hank once again indicated the bulge in his pocket.  Viktor
     now understands the significance of the gesture.

                         HANK
               "Straw God" changed my life.
     
                         VIKTOR
               You saw that?
     
                         HANK
               I've seen every frame of your work. 
               You're the only filmmaker in
               Hollywood with the artistic
               integrity to realize my vision. 
               You and me, art and science... we
               are the perfect marriage.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Listen, Hank, it's been a rough
               day.
                   (climbing into his car)
               I'll call you about his next week.
     
                         HANK
                   (at the car window)
               I won't be here next week.  The
               tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (winding down the window)
               I'm already dead.
     
     Viktor's car roars away.  He looks back at the forlorn Hank
     in the rear view mirror.
     
                         HANK
               Call me.
                   (looking at his watch)
               This week!
     
     A huge eye from a dismantled Nicola Anders billboard is
     wheeled away behind him -- followed by a huge pair of lips.
     
     INT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - DAY
     
     A sea of ingenue headshots.  Black X's are drawn through all
     of them.  VIKTOR lies amongst the rejected faces, talking on
     the telephone, in his spartan bachelor beach house.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (into phone, referring to
                    a young woman's headshot)
               -- What do you mean she won't work
               with me?  She's done nothing.  She
               doesn't have a single credit --
     
                         AGENT'S VOICE
                   (from phone, off-camera)
               -- Better no credits than a
               Taransky credit.  No young actress
               is going to step into Nicola
               Anders' shoes and risk ending her
               career before it's even started.
     
                         VIKTOR
               -- Art, you don't understand.  I've
               mortgaged everything to finish this
               film -- creditors calling, coming
               to the house, for God's sake, I
               need this --
     
     The phone goes dead.  Viktor tries to re-dial --
     disconnected.
     
                         VIKTOR
               -- Damn.
     
     Sharp knock on his door.  Viktor peers through a curtain and
     spies an official-looking MAN IN A SUIT, carrying what looks
     to be a legal notice in his hands.
     
     Viktor slips out of the back door.
     
     EXT.  BEACH - DAY
     
     VIKTOR hurries along the beach.  When he turns, he discovers
     the MAN IN THE SUIT following him.  As Viktor runs, the Suit
     runs -- calling out to him.
     
                         MAN IN THE SUIT
               Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky --
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (calling back)
               I'm not him.
     
     Viktor stumbles.  When he recovers, the Suit is on him.
     
                         MAN IN THE SUIT
               Mr. Taransky, Sir, I represent the
               estate of Mr. Hank Aleno.
                   (showing him Hank's
                    obituary in the L.A. 
                    Times)
               It was Mr. Aleno's last wish that
               you have this.
     
     The Suit hands Viktor a heavily-sealed envelope.
     
                         VIKTOR
               What is it?
     
                         MAN IN THE SUIT
               I have no idea, Sir.  He wanted you
               to have it.
     
     The Suit departs.  Viktor hesitates, then breaks the seal on
     the package -- inside he finds a hard-drive.  The hard-drive
     is labeled "SIMULATION ONE".
     
     A TITLE APPEARS ON THE SCREEN:
     
                           SIX MONTHS LATER
     
     CLOSE UP ON
     
     a VACUUM CLEANER cleaning a tatty red carpet.
     
     On the other end of the vacuum cleaner is VIKTOR.  The red
     carpet leads to a rundown, downtown Los Angeles cinema -- the
     venue for the premiere of "SUNRISE, SUNSET".  To save money
     on posters, Viktor has altered the originals, "Starring
     NICOLA ANDERS" crudely pasted over with "Introducing SIMONE".
     
     EXT.  RUNDOWN DOWNTOWN CINEMA - DUSK
     
     VIKTOR regards the sad, little premiere.  No paparazzi, no
     limos, no klieg lights.  Resorting to giving away tickets to
     PASSERS-BY, Viktor approaches a HOMELESS MAN sleeping in
     trash.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Want to see a free movie?
     
                         HOMELESS MAN
                   (he thinks)
               No.
     
     A taxi pulls up.  Viktor's daughter, LAINEY, steps out.
     
                         LAINEY
                   (kissing him hello)
               Hi, Dad.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Hello, Lainey.
     
     Viktor goes to pay for the taxi but doesn't have quite enough
     cash.  Lainey pays herself.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Your mother couldn't make it?
     
                         LAINEY
               She's at the premiere of "A Cold
               Day In Hell".  But I think she send
               someone from Acquisitions.
     
                         VIKTOR
               She still with Kent?
     
                         LAINEY
               This week anyhow.
     
     VIKTOR escorts Lainey down the empty red carpet, regarding
     the pathetic premiere.  As they walk by, the bulb in Viktor's
     sole spotlight expires.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Not quite how I imagined it --
     
                         LAINEY
                   (looking on the bright
                    side)
               -- You finished the film on your
               own terms, that's what matters. 
               Did you really do all the post
               yourself?
     
                         VIKTOR
               There was no other way.
     
                         LAINEY
               I missed you.  I wondered if you
               were ever coming back.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Me too.
     
                         LAINEY
                   (regarding the makeshift
                    poster, trying to lift
                    his spirits)
               Well, I can't wait to meet
               Simone... what's her last name?
     
                         VIKTOR
               You know, I... don't know.
     
                         LAINEY
               Is she here tonight?
     
                         VIKTOR
               She can't watch herself.
     
     They are interrupted by the THEATER OWNER.
     
                         THEATER OWNER
               -- Hey, we have to start.  I've got
               "Tough Love 2" playing at ten.
     
     EXT.  PIER - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - MORNING
     
     A foggy, empty pier.  A MAN is running through the mist,
     shouting desperately.
     
                         HAL
               Valarie!  VALARIE!
     
     Finally, out of the fog -- a young woman in a black cape and
     hood, her back to us.  The camera pushes in, music swells and
     she turns.  SIMONE.  She is exquisitely, ethereally
     beautiful.  Perfect.
     
     INT.  RUNDOWN DOWNTOWN CINEMA - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
     
     In the near-empty, dilapidated theater, "SUNRISE, SUNSET" is
     playing ON THE SCREEN.
     
     When Simone's face appears, the faces of the AUDIENCE MEMBERS
     change.  They are all visibly moved, including the THEATER
     OWNER.  Some weeping, some with curious smiles on their
     faces, some opened-mouthed.
     
                         HAL
                   (ON SCREEN, approaching)
               Valarie, what are you running from?
     
                         SIMONE
                   (enigmatic smile)
               From Valarie.
     
     Suddenly a GUNSHOT rings out.  Simone collapses to the
     ground.
     
                         HAL
                   (running to her)
               Valarie!  No!
     
     INT.  THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT
     
     VIKTOR, unable to watch, paces up and down, chain-smoking
     while worriedly shoving popcorn in his mouth.  Viktor finally
     musters the courage to look inside the auditorium.
     
     INT.  BEDROOM - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - NIGHT
     
     The same scene that played in the studio screening room. 
     However now when we cut from the leading man, HAL, to the
     leading lady it is not NICOLA but the newly cast SIMONE.
     
                         SIMONE
               -- Why are we here?  Is that what
               you're asking, Jack?... Why are we
               here?  No why.  Just here.
     
     INT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
     
     ON SCREEN SIMONE lies dying.  Now even LAINEY is affected by
     Simone's performance.  She wipes a tear from her eye.
     
     VIKTOR watches the backs of the heads, trying to gauge the
     audience reaction.  Finally the credits roll.
     
     A dedication, "For HANK".
     
     No one moves from their seats.  Viktor permits himself a
     brief smile of satisfaction as he sees his name appear in the
     credits:
     
                      A Film By VIKTOR TARANSKY
     
     Still no one moves from their seats.  Viktor cannot stand it
     any longer.  He runs to the restroom.
     
     INT.  THEATER RESTROOM - NIGHT
     
     Face over the stained sink, VIKTOR splashes himself with
     water.  He looks to the mirror, horrified by his own
     reflection.  He rehearses a courtroom speech.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I
               may be guilty of a crime, but it
               was committed with the purest of
               intentions, to send a message to
               the acting community who put
               themselves above the work and
               above --
     
     Three AUDIENCE MEMBERS enter the restroom.  They approach the
     urinals.
     
                         AUDIENCE MEMBER 1
                   (continuing their
                    conversation from the
                    lobby)
               -- So fake.
     
                         AUDIENCE MEMBER 2
               -- Totally artificial.
     
     Viktor looks at the men aghast and hurriedly exits, missing
     the end of their conversation.
     
                         AUDIENCE MEMBER 1
               We're really supposed to believe
               that was 19th Century Lisbon?
     
                         AUDIENCE MEMBER 3
               Who's looking at the sets when she
               is on the screen?
     
     All three nod in agreement and begin to urinate.
     
     INT.  THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT
     
     VIKTOR exits the restroom.  Almost all the AUDIENCE MEMBERS,
     including LAINEY, are waiting for him.
     
                         LAINEY
                   (pointing out her father)
               There he is.  That's my dad, Viktor
               Taransky.
     
     Viktor is about to run for the exit when the small group
     spontaneously applauds.  They rush to shake his hand.
     
                         AUDIENCE MEMBER 4
               -- She is magnificent.
     
                         AUDIENCE MEMBER 5
               -- Absolutely unreal.
     
     Viktor appears uncomfortable with their compliments.
     
                         VIKTOR
               She wasn't too... cartoony?
     
                         AUDIENCE MEMBER 6
               -- Who?  The nun?
     
                         AUDIENCE MEMBER 7
               -- Or are you talking about the
               mother?
     
                         AUDIENCE MEMBER 8
               -- A star like that, who cares
               about the supporting cast?
     
                         AUDIENCE MEMBER 9
               -- Congratulations again.  She
               was... not of this earth.  You
               should be very proud.
     
                         VIKTOR
               "Not of this earth".  A good way of
               putting it.  And the film as a
               whole -- ?
     
     The group drifts away, leaving LAINEY and VIKTOR alone.
     
                         LAINEY
               She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did
               you find her?
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (vague)
               I saw her picture on the, er...
               internet.
                   (interrogating his
                    daughter's face)
               You really didn't notice anything --
               unusual?
     
                         LAINEY
               Only her brilliance.  To be honest,
               with what you had to work with, I
               was expecting a train wreck.  You
               really pulled it off.
     
     Lainey regards the makeshift poster.
     
                         LAINEY
               I have a feeling mom is going to
               take you back after this.
     
     Viktor's head snaps around.  Lainey smiles.
     
                         LAINEY
               Back on the lot.
     
     Viktor shrugs off the misunderstanding.
     
     INT.  VIKTOR TARANSKY'S MALIBU HOME - NIGHT
     
     VIKTOR enters his sterile, bachelor home, carrying his mail. 
     His answering machine blinks in the darkness, the message
     light reads "FULL".  He hits the "PLAY" button.
     
                         ELAINE (V.O.)
               Viktor, you bastard!  I hear it's
               great.
                   (beat)
               Seriously, I'm happy for you.
     
     Viktor opens a drawer containing a photo of he and Elaine
     from happier times.  He gazes at it as he listens to the
     message.
     
                         ELAINE (V.O.)
               I know people are going to be
               beating down your door but... well,
               I'd love the chance to buy back
               something I gave away for free. 
               Don't you just love Hollywood?...
               BEEP.
     
     Viktor stops the machine, dazed.  He idly opens his mail. 
     Inside an envelope he finds a SAG Card with the new member's
     name, "SIMONE".
     
     A MONTAGE OF SCENES BEGINS TO PLAY.
     
     A)  A line of AUDIENCE MEMBERS stretches outside the rundown
         movie theater as far as the eye can see.
     
                         ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER (O.S.)
               A dazzling new ingenue has come
               from seemingly nowhere to capture
               the hearts of movie-going audiences
               across the nation...
     
     B)  THE FRONT PAGE OF "VARIETY" coming off the presses reads,
         "SIMONE: A REVELATION -- Dawning Of A New Star In
         "SUNRISE".
     
                         ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER (O.S.)
               ... in her debut film, "Sunrise,
               Sunset".
     
     C)  A TEENAGE BOY in a public library logs on to the first
         website dedicated to SIMONE.
     
                         ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER (O.S.)
               Her face is already posted on
               everything from websites to bedroom
               walls.
     
     D)  Trendy TEENAGE GIRLS saunter past a swimming pool in
         Simone capes and hoods despite the sweltering heat.
     
                         ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER (O.S.)
               Her wardrobe has inspired a fashion
               craze.
     
     E)  In a Third World back-alley a YOUNG ASIAN MAN shows an
         UNDERCOVER REPORTER a pirated recording of SIMONE on a
         camcorder.
     
                         ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER (O.S.)
               And bootleg copies of her film are
               being sold in back alleys all over
               the world.
     
     F)  A LIQUOR STORE CUSTOMER watches a TV behind the counter
         showing a clip of SIMONE from, "SUNRISE, SUNSET Courtesy:
         Taransky Productions".
     
                         ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
                   (from TV)
               But who is Simone?  We know so
               little about her.  No details of
               her background have been released,
               not even her age.  She is somewhere
               between a girl and a woman.  A
               fresh face and familiar both at the
               same time.
     
     G)  The ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER now stands outside a
         multiplex.  The marquee has 16 screens and looks like
         this:
     
             "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
             "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
             "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
             "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"

             "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
             "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
             "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "THE MAKING OF
                                            SUNRISE, SUNSET"
     
                         ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
               Is Simone even her real name?  And
               why the secrecy?  All we know for
               sure is that she was discovered by
               little-known director, Viktor
               Tarinsky.
     
     INT.  LIMOUSINE - DAY
     
     VIKTOR, watching "SCENE" on a TV in the back of a limousine,
     corrects the reporter.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Taransky.
     
                         ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
                   (from the TV)
               He has parlayed his relationship
               with the new sensation into a three
               picture deal with the very studio
               that dumped him only six months
               ago.  And no wonder with the
               starlet's performance breaking all
               box office records.
     
     EXT.  STUDIO GATE - MORNING
     
     Outside the studio entrance, a swarm of REPORTERS,
     PHOTOGRAPHERS and FANS rush VIKTOR's limousine, hoping for a
     glimpse of SIMONE.
     
                         MOB
               Simone!  SIMONE!  I LOVE YOU!  I
               Want to BE you!
     
     Studio SECURITY GUARDS hold them back as the limo enters the
     lot.
     
     EXT.  STUDIO - ENTRANCE - DAY
     
     ELAINE and an entourage of EXECUTIVES greets VIKTOR's
     limousine on the studio steps.
      
     A STUDIO PHOTOGRAPHER has a camera at the ready.  A banner
     reads, "Welcome SIMONE".  A YOUNG ASSISTANT wheels a cake.
     
     VIKTOR steps out of the car.  ELAINE pushes past him, into
     the limo.
     
                         ELAINE
               Simone!... Simone?
     
     The car is empty.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (re-emerging from the car)
               Where is she?
     
                         VIKTOR
               Good to see you too, Elaine.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (ignoring his sarcasm)
               Why isn't she with you?
     
                         VIKTOR
               Why?  Because she would never show
               up at something like this.  She's
               intensely private.
     
     Elaine sighs, exasperated.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (dismissing her
                    colleagues)
               Back to work, everyone.  She's not
               here.
     
     The reception committee disperses, murmurs of disappointment.
     
                         ELAINE
               Viktor... I want to thank you for
               convincing Simone to sign with the
               studio.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Don't thank me.  It was entirely
               Simone's decision.  Do you have
               Simone's check?
     
                         ELAINE
               I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it
               means a lot.
                   (quickly changing tack)
               Have you read the reviews?  They're
               love letters.
                   (reading from a newspaper)
               Listen to this one.  "Simone has
               the voice of a young Jane Fonda,
               the body of Sophia Loren, the grace
               of, well, Grace Kelley, and the
               face of Audrey Hepburn combined
               with an angel".
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (musing to himself)
               Almost right.
     
                         ELAINE
               I can't wait to meet her.
     
                         VIKTOR
               I don't know if that's going to
               happen.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (confused)
               Why not?
     
                         VIKTOR
               As I say, she's... something of a
               recluse.  That's how she's able to
               stay so pure -- by isolating
               herself in her art.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (face falling)
               Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a
               press conference.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Out of the question.  A circus like
               that?
     
                         ELAINE
               Viktor, it's my studio.
     
                         VIKTOR
               She's my actor.  There are other
               studios, Elaine.  There's only one
               Simone.
                   (leaving her on the steps)
               Leave the press conference to me.
     
     Viktor strides up the studio steps.  Elaine stares after her
     ex-husband -- she finds herself smiling at his newfound
     arrogance.
     
     EXT.  STUDIO - PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY
     
     The studio soundstages as a backdrop, VIKTOR approaches a
     podium and a forest of microphones, revelling in his recent
     fame by association.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (tapping the microphone)
               Is this on?
     
                         REPORTER 1
               Who are you?
     
                         VIKTOR
               Taransky, Viktor.  T-a-r-a-n-s-k-y,
               V-i-k-t-o-r.
     
                         REPORTER 1
               Yeah, but -- who are you?
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (patronizing smile)
               I am a two-time Academy Award
               nominated director with over
               eighteen films to my credit thus
               far including my latest release,
               "Sunrise, Sunset".  Who are you?
     
     A REPORTER rolls her eyes at his pomposity.
     
                         VIKTOR
               I will not be taking any questions. 
               However I do have a statement to
               read on behalf of my leading lady,
               Simone.
                   (reading from his
                    statement)
               "To Whom It May Concern.  I'm
               deeply grateful for the
               extraordinary public response to
               Mr. Taransky's film.  At this time
               I will be conducting no interviews
               or making publicity appearances
               since I am really nothing without
               the beautiful worlds and characters
               Mr. Taransky creates for me.  I
               politely request that the press
               respect my privacy and let the work
               speak for itself.  All questions
               and inquiries should be directed to
               Mr. Taransky to whom I entrust all
               aspects of my career.  Yours very
               truly, Simone".
     
     The reporters all call out at once.
     
                         REPORTER 2
               -- Viktor, Viktor, who's Simone
               dating?
     
                         REPORTER 3
               -- Viktor, where'd you find her?
     
                         REPORTER 4
               -- Is Simone her real name?
     
                         REPORTER 5
               -- What's she got to hide?
     
                         REPORTER 1
               -- Is she the new Garbo?
     
                         REPORTER 2
               -- Who's Garbo?
     
     Viktor silences the reporters by theatrically raising his
     hands.
     
                         VIKTOR
               I thought I made it clear -- no
               questions regarding Simone.
                   (bringing the press
                    conference to a hasty
                    conclusion)
               Now, I would like to close by
               announcing that Miss Simone begins
               production today on her next film,
               "Eternity Forever".  This project
               has been near and dear to my heart
               since I wrote it nine years ago.
                   (a tinge of bitterness,
                    then a smile)
               I Thank you.
     
     Viktor exits the podium.  A voice stops him in his tracks.
     
                         VOICE (O.S.)
               Who do you think you're fooling,
               Taransky?
     
     Viktor turns.  The voice belongs to over-zealous, crusading,
     truth-seeking investigative reporter, MAX SAYER, accompanied
     by his assistant, MILTON.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Do I know you?
     
                         MAX
               Max Sayer -- National Echo.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (regaining his composure,
                    a smirk)
               Don't you have a real story to
               write?  Why aren't you in Latin
               America?
     
                         MAX
               This is the story.
     
                         VIKTOR
               I remember when the Echo had class 
               -- the paper that could bring down
               governments.
     
                         MAX
               Our leaders aren't presidents
               anymore -- they're pop stars and
               screen idols.  If Woodward and
               Bernstein were alive today, they'd
               be right here in Hollywood with me.
     
                         VIKTOR
               They are alive, Sayer.
     
     Milton confirms that Woodward and Bernstein are still living.
     
                         MAX
               So they're probably here.
                   (hardly missing a beat)
               You might be able to sell this
               'disappearing act' to the rest of
               the world, but I'm not buying it. 
               What's really behind this Simone
               woman?  The public has a right to
               know.  Why is she staying out of
               sight?  And why the hell is she
               with you?  I don't want you to take
               this the wrong way, Viktor, but
               you're not exactly Cecil B. 
               DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Maybe the reason she's with me is a
               little thing called integrity,
               Sayer.  Look it up.
     
     Viktor walks away.
     
                         MAX
                   (calling after him)
               Oh, I know all about integrity.  I
               know even more about persistence. 
               Look that one up.
     
     Max watches Viktor depart, with obvious suspicion.
     
     EXT.  SOUNDSTAGE - STUDIO LOT - DAY
     
     A large satellite dish sits atop a soundstage.
     
     "CLOSED SET" is the sign on the door -- a surveillance camera
     panning the entrance.  A SECURITY GUARD, also keeping watch,
     nods a greeting to VIKTOR as he pulls up in his studio golf
     cart, script in hand.
     
                         SECURITY GUARD
               No one came in or went out just
               like you said, Mr. Taransky.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Good.
     
                         SECURITY GUARD
               Is Miss Simone coming today?
     
                         VIKTOR
               She's already here.  She arrived
               before you and she'll leave long
               after you've gone.
                   (admonishing guard)
               Remember, under no circumstances
               are you or any other person to
               enter the set without my express
               permission.
     
                         SECURITY GUARD
               What if it catches on fire?
     
                         VIKTOR
               Let it burn.  Simone would rather
               go up in flames than give up her
               privacy.
     
     Viktor enters his secret code into the keypad lock and enters
     the soundstage.
     
     INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
     
     The cavernous soundstage is almost completely empty save for
     a small table upon which sits two computer keyboards and a
     tablet attached to a large, projection screen monitor and two
     side monitors.  VIKTOR takes a seat in front of the monitor.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (to himself as he inserts
                    his Hollywood hard-drive 
                    -- SIMULATION ONE)
               Pay no attention to the man behind
               the computer.
     
     A title appears on his computer screen.
     
                               Welcome
                                  to
                            SIMULATION ONE
     
     With a satisfied smile, Viktor backspaces characters until he
     revises the title to:
     
                               Welcome
                                  to
                                SIMONE
     
     He presses "ENTER" and a face begins to build -- wire upon
     wire, pixel upon pixel -- until a completed synthespian
     emerges -- SIMONE.  She is indistinguishable from a flesh-and
     blood actress.
     
     Simone moves on a video loop against a neutral background --
     titled "VISUAL LOOP 6".  Within the confines of the monitor
     she is reminiscent of a beautiful caged animal.  She looks a
     little bored as if she has been cooped up in cyberspace for
     too long.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (to the screen)
               Good morning, Simone.
     
                         SIMONE / VIKTOR
               Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
     
                         VIKTOR
               A star is...
     
                         SIMONE / VIKTOR
               ... digitized.
     
     Only now do we observe that Viktor is occasionally talking
     into a microphone connected to the computer and pressing a
     key on his keyboard.  When he speaks, she speaks.  Simone's
     voice and mouth movements automatically sync in response to
     Viktor's voice.  A scanning light on Viktor allows Simone to
     mimic his movements.
     
                         SIMONE / VIKTOR
               You mean they buy it?
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (nervous smile as he
                    examines his first
                    royalty check)
               Buy it?  They're paying for it. 
               And around here that's how you
               really know they buy it.
     
     Viktor fondly touches a photograph of Hank that is taped to
     the terminal -- from the "L.A. Times" obituaries.
     
                         VIKTOR
               I'm only sorry Hank isn't here to
               see this.
     
     Viktor looks up, Simone mimicking his action.
     
                         SIMONE / VIKTOR
                   (depressing the button
                    every time he wants to
                    express his thoughts
                    through Simone)
               Maybe he can.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Do you have any idea what this
               means, Simone?  Our ability to
               manufacture fraud now exceeds our
               ability to detect it.
     
                         SIMONE / VIKTOR
                   (appearing to indulge
                    Viktor with a smile)
               I am the death of real.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (pondering the enormity of
                    the hoax)
               You are birth of... what?  A
               Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era
               in show business.  All I wanted to
               do was finish the film.
     
                         SIMONE / VIKTOR
               And now look what you've started. 
               And now look what you've started. 
               And now look what you've started.
     
     Viktor's conversation with himself is not merely for his own
     amusement.  He is adjusting and refining Simone's voice.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Hmm... a little less Streep, a
               little more Bacall.
     
     Viktor scrolls through a photo library of stars, living and
     dead, that comprise Simone.
     
     Viktor makes an adjustment on a panel on the computer screen
     dedicated to Simone's audio, incorporating the vocal
     deliveries -- "20% STREEP, 80% BACALL".
     
     He speaks once again as Simone to test the adjustment.  The
     voice patterns appear on his screen -- graphic
     representations of the sound waves.
     
                         SIMONE / VIKTOR
               Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
     
                         VIKTOR
               Yes.  Yes, it is.
     
     VIKTOR snaps back to reality himself.  He scrolls through the
     list of screen legends.  He clicks on the image of AUDREY
     HEPBURN.
     
                         VIKTOR
               While I think of it, I'd like you
               to add something to your repertoire
               -- remember that thing Hepburn does
               in "Breakfast At Tiffany's".
     
     A clip of AUDREY HEPBURN in "Breakfast At Tiffany's" plays on
     the screen.  Hepburn, sitting on a fire escape, looks up.
     
                         AUDREY HEPBURN
                   (from the screen, an
                    incomparable smile)
               Hi.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (pausing the moment)
               Let's hear you say "Hi" like
               Audrey.
     
     With a CUT and PASTE, Viktor morphs the gesture seamlessly
     into a frozen Simone.  Viktor presses play.
     
                         SIMONE
                   (imitating Audrey's
                    performance perfectly)
               Hi.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Perfect.
                   (stretching)
               God, I'm so relaxed around you.
     
                         SIMONE / VIKTOR
               You did create me.
     
                         VIKTOR
               No.  I... just helped bring someone
               else's dream to life.
     
                         SIMONE / VIKTOR
               Mr. Taransky, we both know I was
               nothing without you.  I was
               computer code -- ones and zeros.
     
                         VIKTOR
               You're right.  You're right.  Of
               course, one doesn't want to boast. 
               It's a classic case of technology
               in search of an artist.  That's all
               you've been waiting for, an artist
               with integrity, with a vision, who
               can see.
     
     Viktor gets up and starts walking around the room, warming to
     his theme.  SIMONE moves in a VISUAL LOOP on the monitor,
     nodding attentively as if she's really interested.
     
                         VIKTOR
               See beyond that irrational
               allegiance to flesh and blood. --
               See that with the rise in price of
               a real actor and the fall in price
               of a fake, the scales have tipped
               in favor of the fake.
                   (voice raising in
                    excitement)
               -- See that if the performance is
               genuine, it doesn't matter if the
               actor is real.  Once a performance
               is committed to film, the blood and
               bones are gone anyway.  Only the
               spirit, the illusion remains. 
               Besides, what's real anymore? 
               These days most actors have digital
               work done to them so it's a gray
               area.
     
                         SIMONE / VIKTOR
                   (Simone appears to look
                    directly at her maker)
               Are you ever going to tell the
               truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
     
                         VIKTOR
               The only real truth is in the work.
     
                         SIMONE / VIKTOR
               You know what I'm talking about.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Yes.  Yes, I'm going to tell the
               truth about you, why wouldn't I...?
                   (pondering his own
                    question)
               Of course, with Hank's tragic
               passing, the secret died with him.
                   (shaking the thought from
                    his head)
               I am going to tell the truth...
               after your next picture.
     
     Feeling uneasy at the prospect, Viktor changes the subject. 
     He pulls out his script for "ETERNITY FOREVER".
     
                         VIKTOR
               Speaking of which -- this is the
               project I'd like you to do next.
     
                         SIMONE / VIKTOR
               Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The
               legendary unproduced script that
               was too good ever to get made?  I'd
               kill for that part.
     
                         VIKTOR
               I was hoping you'd say that.
     
     Suddenly, Simone appears to talk on her own.
     
                         SIMONE
               I'll do anything to please you, Mr.
               Taransky.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (pretending to be hard of
                    hearing)
               I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. 
               What did you say?
     
                         SIMONE
               I'll do anything to please you, Mr.
               Taransky.
     
     On a side monitor, we discover a highlighted box marked "PRE
     RECORD" -- Viktor's finger on the "PLAY" button.  He is
     unable to resist speaking another line.
     
                         SIMONE / VIKTOR
               And I will never, ever leave you.
     
     Simone appears to indulge Viktor by blowing him a kiss --
     until we see that Viktor has now highlighted a box marked,
     "GESTURES OF AFFECTION -- WINK, SMILE, GIGGLE, SIGH, KISS,
     FLUTTER OF EYES, FLICK OF HAIR, PUFF OF CHEST".
     
     Viktor comes close to the monitor.  He notices something
     about Simone's face.
     
                         VIKTOR
               You're so beautiful.  Too
               beautiful.
     
     Viktor accesses a program labeled, "DISTINGUISHING FEATURES".
     He adds a "FRECKLE" and a "MOLE".
     
     From a distance we watch him, alone with Simone in the vast,
     empty soundstage.
     
     EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY
     
     VIKTOR's face against the SKY.  As he walks, we reveal that
     the sky is no more than a huge, painted backdrop on the
     studio lot -- behind a parking lot.  Viktor hands his valet
     ticket to a fawning VALET MANAGER.
     
                         VALET MANAGER
               -- Just be a minute, Mr. Taransky. 
               We gave you a complimentary car
               wash -- they're washing the engine
               now.
     
     Viktor joins other industry MOVERS and SHAKERS waiting for
     their cars under an umbrella.  A young TALENT AGENT
     approaches.
     
                         TALENT AGENT
               Viktor!  Look, I'm sorry I didn't
               call you back last year.  I was,
               er... out of the country.
                   (strained moment)
               But we should get together.  My
               schedule's wide open.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Sure, I'll... "call you".
     
     The agent's face falls.  He gets in his car, disconsolate.
     
     Suddenly, HAL SINCLAIR, rushes over and hugs Viktor.
     
                         HAL
               Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
     
                         VIKTOR
               Hello, Hal.
     
                         HAL
               The film.  The chemistry.  No
               reflections on Nicola but Simone
               and I -- we were just so right
               together.
     
                         VIKTOR
               You never were together, Hal.
     
                         HAL
               And still the connection was
               undeniable.
                   (aside)
               I haven't read "Eternity Forever"
               but I know it's brilliant.  And I
               know I would be perfect for Clive.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (correcting him)
               Clyde.
     
                         HAL
               Yes, perfect.
                   (lowering his voice)
               As a matter of fact, I ran into
               Simone on the lot the other day.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (genuinely startled)
               Really?  She didn't mention it.
     
                         HAL
                   (quickly covering)
               I'm sure she's meeting with a lot
               of people right now.
                   (under his breath)
               She is just as you described her,
               Viktor... indescribable.  I
               strongly sensed she thought I was
               right for it.
     
     Behind his back, Viktor surreptitiously presses a button on
     his cell phone.  The phone rings.  Viktor feigns surprise and
     answers.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (answering the phone he
                    has just dialed, louder
                    than necessary)
               Hello?... SIMONE!  How are you,
               sweetheart?
     
     A hush descends over the executives.  Hal is suddenly very
     uncomfortable.  Even the VALETS strain to eavesdrop on the
     conversation.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (winking to Hal)
               You'll never guess who I'm with...
               you ran into him on the lot.
     
                         HAL
               It was more in passing.
     
                         VIKTOR
               You're so far off!
                   (finally chuckles)
               Hal... Hal Sinclair... your co-
               star.  Remember now?... No, I don't
               think he's put on weight.
                   (a shrug of apology to the
                    appalled Hal)
               Anyway, you think he's right for
               "Eternity Forever"?... not the
               right type?... a different
               direction...
                   (covering phone, to Hal)
               I'll try to talk her into it.
     
     The other INDUSTRY PEOPLE make a note of the remark.  A
     mortified Hal excuses himself with a pathetic wave, climbing
     into his car.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (into phone)
               ... Listen this is a bad place to
               talk... what?... sweetheart, I know
               you have charity work you want to
               do, I know you want to give back --
               but remember, your greatest gift is
               your talent... we'll talk about it
               at the beach house this weekend...
               I'm looking forward to it too.
     
     Viktor hangs up.  His car pulls up.  He tips extravagantly
     and drives away.  The INDUSTRY PEOPLE get on their cell
     phones.
     
     EXT.  STUDIO LOT - FACADE - DAY
     
     Parked behind the sky facade is a curious CAR with shaded
     windows.
     
     INT.  CAR - DAY
     
     Inside the car, MAX SAYER and assistant MILTON, scanner in
     hand, are replaying Viktor's intercepted phone call on a
     computer.
     
                         VIKTOR'S VOICE
                   (from the machine)
               -- "... You think he's right for
               "Eternity Forever"?... not the
               right type?... a different
               direction..."
     
                         MILTON
                   (to Max, a shake of the
                    head)
               I'm getting nothing from her side
               of the conversation.
     
                         MAX
               Is it a jamming device?
     
                         MILTON
                   (shrugs)
               Maybe he's talking to himself.
     
                         MAX
                   (dismissing the idea)
               Taransky isn't that good an actor. 
               No, they're taking special
               precautions.  Some kind of new
               encryption.
     
                         MILTON
               Why?
     
                         MAX
                   (musing)
               Whatever it is, it's dark.
     
                         MILTON
               Dark?
     
                         MAX
               Yes, very.
     
     They continue listening to the recording.
     
                         VIKTOR'S VOICE
               "... We'll talk about it at the
               beach house this weekend..."
     
     MAX's eyes light up.  He gazes to a photo of SIMONE pasted to
     the inside of the car.
     
     INT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOME - MORNING
     
     VIKTOR and LAINEY make breakfast.  Lainey is in her pajamas,
     occasionally glancing to a laptop computer as her father
     prepares French toast.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (glancing to the computer)
               Can't you stop that?
     
                         LAINEY
               Why?
     
                         VIKTOR
               Those things can be dangerous. 
               Staring at a screen all day -- you
               miss what's going on outside in the
               real world.  You can lose yourself. 
               You should get out more.  How are
               you going to meet boys?
     
                         LAINEY
                   (shrugs coyly, getting up)
               I know plenty of boys.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Really?  Who?  Where do you meet
               them?  In a chat room?  How do you
               know he's not some middle-aged
               freak?
     
                         LAINEY
               Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak
               a mile away.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Okay.  But you have to find a way
               to escape that thing.
     
                         LAINEY
               I do.
     
                         VIKTOR
               How?
     
                         LAINEY
               I read.
     
                         VIKTOR
               You do?  Still?  I can't tell you
               how happy I am to hear that.
     
                         LAINEY
               You were the one who insisted on
               it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and
               Joyce when I was four.
     
                         VIKTOR
               You understood them.  That's what
               was amazing.
                   (looking out the window)
               It's a nice day.  Let's eat
               outside.
     
     Lainey grabs the plates and opens the deck door.  We hear a
     chorus of CLICKS.
     
                         LAINEY
               Actually, it may be nicer inside.
     
     Viktor joins her at the doorway.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Stay here, I'll deal with this.
     
     Unfazed, Lainey retreats into the house.
     
     EXT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - MORNING
     
     Boats are moored just off the beach packed dangerously full
     of telephoto lens-toting PHOTOGRAPHERS.  The next door houses
     have LENSES protruding through the drapes of the windows.
     
     VIKTOR strides onto the lawn of his property that backs onto
     the beach, soaking up the attention -- unable to resist
     waving extravagantly.
     
     Suddenly, a PHOTOGRAPHER, losing his balance, drops from a
     nearby rooftop.  The photographer limps towards the fence. 
     Viktor calmly follows, retrieving the photographer's camera
     and ripping out the film with a flourish -- he is clearly
     relishing the attention.
     
     The photographer clambers over the fence where he joins
     several dozen other SHUTTER-BUGS and VIDEORAZZI.
     
                         PHOTOGRAPHER 1
               That wasn't her, Taransky.
     
                         ECHO PHOTOGRAPHER
               Where is she?  You can't hide her
               forever.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (hurling the camera into
                    the mob)
               You'll never find her.  Simone only
               appears when I want her to appear.
     
     MAX SAYER from "The NATIONAL ECHO" is at the head of the mob,
     accompanied by assistant MILTON.
     
                         MAX
               She sounds like a prisoner,
               Taransky.  Are you holding her
               hostage?  Are you some kind of
               Svengali?
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (recognizing the reporter)
               Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or
               you?  You look kind of "captive"
               yourself.  While you're spending
               every waking hour obsessing over
               Simone, guess what, I guarantee she
               doesn't even know you exist.  Get
               off my property or I'll call the
               cops.
     
                         MAX
               The cops?  The cops read my column
               to know who to bust.  We're the
               only watchdog the public has.
                   (looking around at the
                    photographers)
               None of this is going away.  We'll
               be here tomorrow and the day after
               that.  Until you slip up.  And you
               will.  You are looking at your
               shadow.
                   (getting in his face)
               Because all these elaborate
               precautions with Simone -- every
               instinct in my body tells me, it's
               not natural.
     
                         VIKTOR
               I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. 
               I don't want you to be
               disappointed.  It gets cold out
               here at night.
     
                         MAX
               Nice try.  If we can't get to her
               through you, maybe your family will
               be more co-operative.  I can
               guarantee you, Taransky, one way or
               another, Miss Simone and I are
               going to get acquainted.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (turning away)
               I'd like to see that, Sayer. 
               Invite me.
     
     INT.  VIKTOR'S CAR - DAY
     
     VIKTOR drives along a twisty mountain road, LAINEY in the
     passenger seat.  They have become so blase about the
     paparazzi, they no longer acknowledge the posse of motorcycle
     PHOTOGRAPHERS risking their necks to stay up with the car.
     
                         REPORTER (ON RADIO)
               -- The rumor is, Simone is holed up
               in Taransky's Malibu home -- so far
               we haven't seen so much as a
               glimpse --
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (switching off the radio)
               Honey, I'm really sorry about all
               this.  I don't know if it's safe
               for you to stay the weekends...
               just until things settle down.
     
                         LAINEY
                   (shrugs)
               Okay, Dad.
     
                         VIKTOR
               If anyone asks about Simone --
     
                         LAINEY
               -- I know, I don't know anything.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Exactly.
                   (slightly irritated by her
                    lack of interest)
               Don't you wonder where I'm really
               hiding Simone?
     
                         LAINEY
                   (looking to him)
               I'm sure you'd tell me if you
               thought it was important.
     
     Lainey gives her father a smile.  Through the car window
     behind her, a MOTORCYCLIST appears to lose control and drops
     down a bank.
     
     EXT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
     
     VIKTOR'S car pulls up to Elaine's imposing mansion.  LAINEY
     gives her father a kiss and departs.  ELAINE, in the garden,
     overseeing a GARDENER pruning roses, approaches.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (from the car)
               Sorry I didn't get her back in
               time.
     
                         ELAINE
               No problem.
                   (she smiles)
               Do you want to come in?
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (surprised -- pleasantly)
               Why not?
     
     INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
     
     VIKTOR walks down a hall, passing the dining room, where KENT
     is working on a computer.  Kent smiles blandly.
     
                         KENT
               Hey, Vik.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (disappointed to see him)
               Hello -- Kent.
     
     INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
     
     VIKTOR waits in an opulent drawing room.  Despite the eighty
     degree temperature outside, a fire burns in the hearth. 
     ELAINE enters, waving a thick studio file.  Viktor's face
     falls, expecting a less business-related conversation.
     
                         ELAINE
               Viktor, we simply have to talk
               about "Eternity..."
     
                         VIKTOR
               "Forever".
     
                         ELAINE
               Whatever.  I still haven't received
               Simone's script notes.
     
                         VIKTOR
               There aren't any.  If the
               filmmakers are happy, Simone's
               happy.  She considers herself an...
               "instrument".
     
                         ELAINE
               Really?  Oh, so she's really going
               to do all this nudity?
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (shrugs)
               If it's on the page...
     
     Elaine refers to her documents, bewildered.
     
                         ELAINE
               Well, something has to be done
               about this budget.  It's completely
               unrealistic.
                   (referring to a column in
                    the budget)
               You allowed nothing for limousine
               service.
     
                         VIKTOR
               She'll drive herself.
     
                         ELAINE
               Hair and make-up?
     
                         VIKTOR
               She'll do her own.  Theater
               training.
     
                         ELAINE
               She was in the theater?  When? 
               Where?
     
                         VIKTOR
               I'll send you her resume.
     
                         ELAINE
               Al least a contingency for
               wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a
               dress size.
     
                         VIKTOR
               -- I guarantee she won't gain an
               once.  She's very disciplined.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (concerned by an entry in
                    the budget)
               Well, we have to do something about
               this -- "stuntwoman".
     
                         VIKTOR
               What about it?
     
                         ELAINE
               There isn't one.
     
                         VIKTOR
               No need.  She does all her own
               stunts.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (skeptical)
               Even the fall from the plane?
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (nonchalant)
               Even the fall from the plane.
     
                         ELAINE
               Well, shoot it on the last day.
     
     Viktor regards Elaine with a condescending look.
     
                         VIKTOR
               As I've tried to explain to you,
               Elaine.  Simone isn't like any
               other actress you've ever known. 
               She's about the work and only the
               work -- lives for the work.  She
               wants all the money up there...
                   (gazing into space)
               ... on the screen where it belongs. 
               She'd work for scale except I know
               you only respect people you pay a
               fortune.
     
                         ELAINE
               Which accounts for your percentage.
                   (tossing the budget on the
                    coffee table)
               When do I get to meet this dream?
     
                         VIKTOR
               Not today.  She's learning her
               lines.
                   (glancing to Elaine's
                    budget)
               You can also take cue cards and
               teleprompter out of the budget.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (smiles)
               I'll walk you out.
     
     Elaine escorts Viktor out to the lavish garden.
     
     EXT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - GARDEN - DAY
     
     ELAINE's demeanor softens.  She speaks to VIKTOR quietly,
     sympathetically.
     
                         ELAINE
               Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to
               you now, not as Elaine, studio
               head, but Elaine, ex-wife.
                   (correcting herself)
               Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this
               last time but you need to be
               careful.  We both know you wouldn't
               be making this overblown art film
               of you hadn't convinced Simone to
               be in it.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Elaine, talking to you now, not as
               Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex
               husband... what the hell happened
               to you?
     
                         ELAINE
                   (exasperated)
               Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this
               a hundred times -- young stars
               destroying the very people who
               discovered them.  I'm worried about
               you, that's all.  This woman -- she
               controls your destiny.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Simone does not control my destiny.
     
                         ELAINE
               Viktor, I have a feeling.  One of
               my feelings.  There's something
               about her I don't trust.
     
     From her bedroom window on the mansion's second floor, LAINEY
     smiles at the sight of her mother and father together.
     
     INT.  SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
     
     VIKTOR enters his office where he's greeted by his assistant,
     JANE.
     
                         JANE
                   (sheepish)
               Thanks for taking me back, Mr.
               Taransky.  I know it looked like I
               sided with the studio, but I always
               believed in you, honestly.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Don't worry.  I understand.
     
                         JANE
                   (referring to the cast
                    seated around a
                    conference table)
               They're all here.
     
     INT.  SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
     
     VIKTOR sits at the head of the table, surrounded by HAL,
     LOTUS, MAC and three other CAST MEMBERS.  A preliminary
     poster behind him -- "COMING THIS SUMMER - SIMONE in ETERNITY
     FOREVER" -- bears a huge photograph of Simone's face.
     
                         VIKTOR
               I can't tell you how delighted I am
               to have this wonderful cast
               assembled for "Eternity Forever". 
               Thank you all.  Now, a reminder --
               as a condition for working on this
               film, you will not be rehearsing
               with Simone, shooting with Simone
               and you are forbidden from
               contacting Simone in any way at any
               time, whatsoever.
     
     The CAST nods seriously.
     
                         HAL
                   (a thought occurs)
               How will you do our love scenes?
     
                         VIKTOR
               Body double.
     
                         HAL
                   (confused)
               For her?
     
                         VIKTOR
               For you.
                   (addressing the entire
                    cast)
               I want you to know, Simone
               appreciates you all working for
               scale.  But why am I thanking you? 
               Simone can thank you herself.  She
               insisted on speaking with you
               before filming begins.  She's on
               the line now.
     
     Viktor nods to a speaker phone in the center of the table, a
     red blinking light on the phone.  The cast reacts excitedly.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (pushing a button on the
                    phone)
               Simone, are you there?
     
                         SIMONE
                   (through the speakerphone)
               I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
     
                         LOTUS
                   (unable to contain her
                    excitement)
               So are we, Simone!
     
     Everyone laughs giddily.
     
                         SIMONE (O.S.)
               Why don't you leave me alone with
               my co-stars, Mr. Taransky, so we
               can get to know each other better?
     
                         HAL
               Good idea.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Of course.  I'll be back in a
               minute.
     
     Viktor exits.
     
                         SIMONE (O.S.)
               Hi.  Who's there?  Don't be shy. 
               Introduce yourselves.
     
     The CAST stares nervously at the speakerphone.  Mac breaks
     the silence.
     
                         MAC
               I'm Mac.  I turned down a
               Bertolucci film to be here.
     
                         LOTUS
               My name's Lotus.  God, I can't
               believe I'm talking to you.  We're
               going to become such great friends.
     
                         HAL
               I'm Hal.  Wonderful to be working
               together... again.
     
     The other cast members introduce themselves.
     
     EXT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
     
     VIKTOR pulls up sharply in his studio golf cart outside the
     nearby soundstage and hurriedly enters.
     
     INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
     
     VIKTOR races across the vast, empty space to a digital
     player, connected to a phone.  Simone's pre-recorded opening
     remarks (graphically represented on the screen) are almost
     completed.
     
                         SIMONE
               Is that everyone...?
                   (pause)
               Well, obviously, as you know...
     
     Viktor jumps into the conversation in the nick of time,
     speaking through the synthesizer.  As usual, Viktor's voice
     is automatically synthesized into the voice of Simone.
     
                         SIMONE / VIKTOR
               ... I'm Simone.   
     
     The other CAST MEMBERS laugh nervously.
     
                         HAL
                   (from Viktor's
                    speakerphone)
               Obviously.  Who else?
     
                         SIMONE / VIKTOR
                   (from speaker phone)
               I just want to start by apologizing
               for my "process" --
     
     INT.  SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
     
     The CAST are hunched over the speakerphone.
     
                         MAC
               -- No.  No.  I'm completely
               simpatico.  On my last film I was
               playing a schizophrenic so I made
               them give me two dressing rooms.
     
                         HAL
                   (an aside)
               So committed.
     
                         SIMONE (O.S.)
               Well thank you for your
               understanding.  I know it's an
               unusual way to work but I just find
               I relate better to people when
               they're not actually there.
     
                         LOTUS
               Of course, of course.
     
                         SIMONE (O.S.)
               I don't have much to say except
               that I know it's going to be a
               great project, if we all just trust
               Mr. Taransky's vision.  Always do
               what Mr. Taransky says.  If in
               doubt, do it the Taransky way.
     
     They all nod vigorously in agreement.
     
                         SIMONE (O.S.)
               I know we're going to make a
               wonderful movie together.
     
                         LOTUS
                   (nodding in agreement)
               Wonderful movie.
     
                         HAL
               Together, absolutely.
     
     EXT.  SOUNDSTAGE - DUSK
     
     VIKTOR removes his own garbage from his soundstage.  A young
     cleaning woman, VIVIAN, wheeling a janitor's cart,
     tentatively approaches.
     
                         VIVIAN
               Mr. Taransky...
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (referring to the stage)
               No one goes in there.
     
                         VIVIAN
               Oh, I know.
     
     Vivian hesitantly hands Viktor a publicity photo of SIMONE.
     
                         VIVIAN
               If it's not too much trouble. 
               Could you...?
     
                         VIKTOR
               Of course...
     
                         VIVIAN
                   (hesitant about broaching
                    the subject)
               This last year I was... going
               through some things.
                   (shaking her head at the
                    memory)
               Awful, awful... things.  But when I
               saw Simone in "Sunrise"... what she
               did... in the scene in the
               fireworks factory...
                   (face lighting up)
               ... suddenly everything made sense. 
               My friends, family, doctors --
               nobody could reach me -- but
               Simone, she really... spoke to me.
     
     Viktor is touched by the heartfelt testimony.
     
                         VIKTOR
               She'll be happy to sign it.
     
     INT.  PRODUCTION SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
     
     A green set.  Walls, floor, ceiling -- all green.  A FULL
     CAST shoots HAL, dressed in a futuristic suit, tentatively
     crossing the green expanse.
     
     Hal pauses, looks longingly, then impulsively dashes forward. 
     Hal passionately embraces thin air and wrestles it to the
     ground.
     
                         VIKTOR (O.S.)
               Cut!  Cut!... Cut!
     
     Hal freezes.  VIKTOR runs from behind the camera and
     confronts Hal on the green floor.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Hal, what are you doing?
     
                         HAL
               Viktor, Clyde simply has to get
               close to Simone in this scene!  He
               has to touch her.  He has to!
     
                         VIKTOR
               Absolutely not!
     
                         HAL
               But she's right there!  I must feel
               her!
     
                         VIKTOR
               You can't.
     
                         HAL
               Why not?
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (struggling to find an
                    excuse)
               There's... a wall between you --
     
                         HAL
               -- an emotional wall, I know. 
               That's why --
     
                         VIKTOR
               -- No.  No.  A real wall.
                   (describing a wall with
                    his hands within the
                    green space)
               You ran right through it.
     
                         HAL
                   (confused)
               How did the wall get there?
     
                         VIKTOR
               I can't explain it to you now --
               you'll see when it's all put
               together.
                   (walking away)
               Anyway, we got it a couple of takes
               ago.  Let's move on.
     
     Hal, dumbfounded, tentatively touches the non-existent wall.
     
     INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
     
     Viktor digitally adds SIMONE standing beside a sportscar with
     HAL in a scene from "Eternity Forever".  He works on her
     close up.
     
                         SIMONE
                   (eyes welling with tears)
               -- What you don't understand,
               Clyde, is that love is like a wild
               flower, but that flower only
               grows --
     
     Viktor hits STOP and Simone freezes.  Viktor brings up a menu
     and chooses from a range of "EMOTIONAL OPTIONS".

     He fine-tunes SIMONE's performance -- sliding a cursor on a
     performance axis from "BROAD" to "SUBTLE".
     
                         VIKTOR
               Let's take it down a notch.
     
                         SIMONE
               -- What you don't understand --
     
     Simone freezes again.  Viktor make another adjustment.
     
                         VIKTOR
               I like it.  But still too big.
                   (making a correction)
               Smaller teardrops next time.
     
     Simone's tears retreat into her eyes.
     
                         VIKTOR
               It's not working.  It's not alive. 
               Let's try it again.
     
     She repeats the line.  Viktor mimes the performance.
     
                         SIMONE
                   (teardrops arriving on
                    cue)
               -- What you don't understand,
               Clyde, is that love is like a wild
               flower, but that flower only grows
               on the edge...
                   (dramatic pause)
               ... of a very high cliff.
     
     Simone FREEZES.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Perfect, Simone.
     
     Viktor returns SIMONE to her neutral background.
     
                         VIKTOR
               I'm only sorry you still have to
               work with flesh and blood for the
               time being -- as user friendly as
               you are, even I can't manufacture
               an entire cast.
     
     "To Vivian.  Love, Simone" -- VIKTOR writes on the publicity
     shot.  He applies lipstick and adds a kiss to the photo.
     
     Viktor wipes his mouth and looks to SIMONE on his screen --
     she is waiting patiently, as usual.
     
                         VIKTOR
               We are going to have to change our
               plans, Simone -- you have no idea
               what an affect your performance is
               having on people.  We can't stop
               now.  There's too much to say --
               these films they speak, they speak
               to the human condition.  We're
               changing lives.  No, revealing the
               truth now would be too cruel.
                   (searching for more
                    justification)
               Anyway, when you're seeking a
               greater truth -- in the work -- you
               are not so concerned with the
               lesser truths along the way.
     
     Simone doesn't appear convinced.
     
                         SIMONE / VIKTOR
               You're going to get in a lot of
               trouble, Mr. Taransky.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (irritated at her pricking
                    his conscience)
               Why do you have to bring that up? 
               There's always risk -- life's a
               risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how
               could something so lovely be a
               crime?
                   (regarding her tenderly)
               Well, I think we've done enough for
               today.  You've been cooped up in
               there too long.  How about you and
               me go out on the town?  They're
               expecting us.
     
     He turns to a copy of "The Echo".  A photo of Viktor at the
     gate of his Malibu home.  "SIMONE HELD CAPTIVE - Self
     proclaimed Svengali Keeps Star Out Of Limelight".  Viktor
     puts Simone to sleep and picks up a briefcase.
     
     INT.  HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
     
     VIKTOR, briefcase in hand, strides through the lobby of an
     opulent hotel.  He approached the CONCIERGE.
     
                         VIKTOR
               I'm checking in a special guest...
                   (obviously conspiratorial)
               ... Miss Enomis.
     
     The Concierge straightens as he recognizes Viktor from a copy
     of "Variety".  Headline: "Taransky Rides Ingenue's Coat-Tails
     To Three Picture Deal".
     
                         CONCIERGE
               Miss Enomis, yes.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Miss Enomis demands her privacy. 
               You will switch off all
               surveillance cameras.  I will
               escort Miss Enomis to her room
               alone via the rear exit.  She will
               require no help with her luggage. 
               She does not wish to be disturbed
               at any time for any reason.  She
               will be departing for a function
               tonight at eight sharp.
                   (tipping him with a
                    hundred dollar bill)
               I'm sure I can rely on your
               discretion.  Do you understand?
     
                         CONCIERGE
                   (passing the key to
                    Viktor)
               Oh, I understand.
     
     As Viktor departs, the Concierge holds the registration card
     to the mirror.
     
     ENOMIS becomes SIMONE.
     
     The Concierge picks up his phone.
     
     INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
     
     VIKTOR enters the hotel suite.  We see a montage of scenes --
     Viktor revelling in his masquerade.
     
     A)  VIKTOR pulls down the covers of a bed and rolls around in
         the sheets to give it a slept-in look.
     
     B)  VIKTOR sprays cologne in the bed.
     
     C)  VIKTOR tosses skimpy lingerie on the floor of the closet.
     
     D)  VIKTOR eats several candy bars from the mini-bar.
     
     E)  VIKTOR puts one of his own movies in the DVD player.
     
     F)  VIKTOR writes a note on the bedside pad.
     
     G)  In the bathroom, shower running, VIKTOR attempts to open
         a tampon -- it shoots out of the applicator like a penny
         rocket.
     
     H)  VIKTOR cuts a lock of "faux" hair from a Simone wig and
         scatters it on the counter.
     
     I)  VIKTOR shakes open a bag of toiletries, the toothbrush
         bouncing into the toilet bowl.  He retrieves it.
     
     J)  VIKTOR looks through the drapes of the hotel window -- a
         jam of PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS has congregated outside the
         rear entrance.
     
     K)  VIKTOR shines a lamp against a doll casting a life-size
         shadow on the drapes.  A "walking" silhouette is visible
         to the media on the street.
     
     L)  VIKTOR writes a message in lipstick on the mirror -- "I
         LOVE YOU V--".
     
     VIKTOR is interrupted by a knock on the door.  He looks at
     his watch.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (peering through the
                    peephole)
               Who is it?
     
                         WOMAN'S VOICE
                   (from other side of door)
               It's... Simone.
     
     Viktor smiles.
     
     EXT.  HOTEL - REAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT
     
     VIKTOR stands at the rear entrance of the hotel with a leggy
     YOUNG WOMAN wearing a coat over her head.  A HOTEL DOORMAN
     keeps back the growing horde of REPORTERS.
     
     Viktor's limousine waits at the curb.  The coated woman
     starts towards the car but Viktor holds her back.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Not yet.
                   (scrutinizing the crowd)
               Where's "Matinee"?  There they are. 
               Okay, I think everyone's here. 
               Now!
     
     Viktor and the young woman run the gauntlet to the car,
     providing a perfect albeit restricted photo-op for the
     paparazzi.
     
                         PHOTOGRAPHER 1
               Simone!
     
                         ECHO PHOTOGRAPHER
               Over here, sweetheart!
     
                         PHOTOGRAPHER 3
               Come one Simone, take it off, baby!
     
                         PHOTOGRAPHER 4
               We got a job to do!
     
     The car door slams shut as the pack descends.  MAX SAYER and
     MILTON are amongst the frustrated reporters.  The limo
     screeches away.  A POLICE MOTORCYCLIST prevents anyone
     following.
     
     The frustrated REPORTERS assess their efforts.
     
                         PHOTOGRAPHER 1
               I think I got a piece of her ear.
     
                         ECHO PHOTOGRAPHER
               I didn't get shit.
     
                         MILTON
                   (emerging from the pack,
                    to Max)
               Ten feet from a living Goddess...
     
     INT.  MISS ENOMIS'S HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
     
     MAX SAYER pays off the CONCIERGE.  His assistant, MILTON,
     begins to collect "evidence" of the celebrity -- dusting for
     fingerprints, etc.  Max rubs pencil into the impression on
     the bedside notepad revealing the message -- "The meaning of
     life is that it ends".
     
                         MAX
                   (interrupting Milton's
                    work)
               Leave me for a moment.
     
     Milton and the Concierge depart.
     
     Max is alone.  He looks around the room.
     
     A)  MAX enters the bathroom.  He picks up a drinking glass
         and inspects it closely before placing it in a sealed
         plastic bag.
     
     B)  MAX examines the wet soap from the shower and also places
         it in a plastic bag.
     
     C)  MAX picks up the used toothbrush, puts it to his lips
         before placing it in a plastic bag.
     
     D)  MAX gently places his hands on the toilet seat.
     
     E)  MAX enters the bedroom.  He carefully removes a slip from
         a pillow.  He folds it meticulously, appearing to breathe
         in its scent as he places it in a plastic bag.
     
     F)  Finally, MAX kneels and gazes at "Simone's" unmade bed. 
         He slowly slides into the bed and slips beneath the same
         sheets recently vacated by Viktor.
     
     INT.  HALLWAY - OUTSIDE HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
     
     MILTON, ear pressed against the door, tries to listen inside.
     
     INT.  VIKTOR TARANSKY'S LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
     
     VIKTOR and the COATED WOMAN have finally left the PAPARAZZI
     in their wake.  Viktor gently removes the coat from over her
     head.
     
     Although the woman is impossible beautiful, she is not
     Simone.  FAITH is Simone's latest stand-in and decoy.  Viktor
     and Faith are still pressed together against one side of the
     limousine.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (not quite able to avert
                    his eyes from her
                    telescopic legs)
               Thank God for you, Faith.  I know
               this is above and beyond the call
               of duty for a stand-in.  You don't
               know what a service you're
               performing for Simone -- shielding
               her from those animals.
     
                         FAITH
               No, thank God for you, Mr.
               Taransky.  How many men would go
               to so much trouble to protect a
               woman?
     
     Neither Viktor nor Faith seem inclined to move from their
     intimate position.
     
                         VIKTOR
               You understand you'll have to come
               back to my place to keep them off
               the, er...
                   (his nose close to Faith's
                    neck)
               ... scent.
     
                         FAITH
               Of course.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (meeting her gaze)
               You look so, so...
     
                         FAITH
               ... so much like her?
     
                         VIKTOR
               Yes, of course, but very beautiful
               in your own right.
     
                         FAITH
               I do find myself physically
               attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
     
     Their lips are now tantalizingly close.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Viktor.
     
     INT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - NIGHT
     
     VIKTOR'S HEAD hits the sofa in his living room, closely
     followed by FAITH on top of him.
     
     Faith tears at his clothes and her own, ravenous.  Viktor
     hardly resists.  In the midst of the wild caresses, Faith
     murmurs in his ear.
     
                         FAITH
               Do whatever you do to Simone.
     
     Viktor freezes.
     
                         VIKTOR
               What?... What did you say?
     
                         FAITH
               Do what you do to Simone.
     
                         VIKTOR
               What I do to Simone?
     
                         FAITH
               Yes, call me Simone.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Simone?
     
                         FAITH
                   (still tearing at his
                    clothes)
               Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what
               you do to Simone.  I want to know
               what it's like to be her just for
               one night.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (confused)
               You're with me to be close to her?
     
                         FAITH
                   (panting)
               Is that a problem?
     
     As Viktor ponders the question, Faith begins to do Simone's
     deathbed speech from "Sunrise, Sunset".
     
                         FAITH
               "Why are we here?  Is that what
               you're asking, Jack?... Why are we
               here?  No why.  Just here".
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (this is too much for
                    Viktor)
               Please put your clothes on
     
     Viktor gets up from the sofa, leaving the frustrated Faith to
     straighten her clothes.
     
     EXT.  FUTURISTIC LANDSCAPE - "ETERNITY FOREVER" - DAY
     
     The finished scene with SIMONE and HAL plays ON A SCREEN.
     
     INT.  SCREENING ROOM - STUDIO - DAY
     
     VIKTOR watches the rough cut of "ETERNITY FOREVER" with
     ELAINE and daughter, LAINEY.  As usual, they are mesmerized
     by the breath-taking beautiful SIMONE.  The scene ends.  The
     light go up.
     
                         ELAINE
               Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood
               Foreign Press is going to eat this
               up.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Thank you.
                   (turning to his daughter)
               What did you think, Lainey?
     
                         LAINEY
               One thing bothered me.
     
                         VIKTOR
               I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
     
                         LAINEY
               No, not that.  I was just wondering
               -- in the bedroom scene in reel two
               why did Simone have no reflection
               when she walked in front of that
               mirror?
     
     Viktor is shocked, busted.  He covers it with a laugh.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (ashen-faced)
               I wondered if you'd spot that. 
               You've got a good eye, Lainey.  I'm
               proud of you.
     
     Elaine looks at Viktor for an explanation.
     
                         VIKTOR
               I got them to remove the
               reflection.  The mirror's metaphor 
               -- to show how her character's
               inwardly dead.
     
                         ELAINE
               That's genius, Viktor.  Was that
               Simone's idea?
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (sarcastic, annoyed at the
                    suggestion)
               Who else?  It's always Simone's
               idea.
     
                         LAINEY
                   (not quite convinced)
               So that accounts for the lack of a
               shadow in reel six?
     
                         VIKTOR
               Precisely.
     
     EXT.  STUDIO LOT - NIGHT
     
     VIKTOR escorts ELAINE and LAINEY to Elaine's car parked
     outside the theater.
     
                         LAINEY
                   (as she gets into the car)
               Good-night, Daddy.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (kissing Lainey good-bye)
               Night, Lainey.
     
     Elaine and Viktor linger a moment outside the car.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (drawing Elaine aside)
               Elaine, I don't know if it's a good
               idea for Lainey to come to the
               screenings -- mature content and
               all that.
     
     Both look to Lainey.  From inside the car Lainey watches her
     parents.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (impressed by his
                    responsible attitude)
               Maybe you're right.
                   (gently teasing)
               Twelve years after your daughter's
               born you decide to become a father.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Better late than never.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (softening)
               I should fire you more often.  The
               film's looking wonderful.
     
                         VIKTOR
               You really think so?
     
                         ELAINE
               Yes.  To be honest I never quite
               saw this film before -- maybe it's
               the way Simone is playing it -- but
               what it's saying about the illusion
               of permanence in everyday life, how
               that's the only way we can love --
               I think it's really going to mean
               something.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you
               liked it.
     
                         ELAINE
               I'd love to tell her myself.
                   (cajoling)
               When are you going to let me meet
               her?
     
                         VIKTOR
               Soon.  Soon.
     
                         ELAINE
               Everyone I know has met her,
               Viktor.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Everyone you know is lying.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (amused)
               That's true.
     
     They instinctively kiss, more affectionate than before. 
     However, their embrace is interrupted by a click of a camera
     shutter from a nearby bush.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Damnit!
     
     The PHOTOGRAPHER has gone but so has the mood.
     
                         ELAINE
               You know how you can stop that. 
               She has to get out more.
                   (climbing into the car)
               See you at the premiere.
     
     Elaine climbs into her car and drives away.
     
     EXT.  PREMIERE - DUSK
     
     The premiere for "ETERNITY FOREVER" is everything VIKTOR had
     hoped for "SUNRISE, SUNSET".  Red carpet, klieg lights
     searching the sky, screaming FANS and PAPARAZZI.
     
     A limousine pulls up, door opens and VIKTOR steps out.  The
     crowd screams with excitement.
     
     Viktor waves.  Am expectancy in the crowd -- people crane
     their necks, waiting for someone else to step out of the open
     car door... but nothing.  The door shuts.  A disappointed
     murmer.  The limo drives off.
     
     VIKTOR walks down the carpet to little fanfare.
     
                         PREMIERE REPORTER 1
                   (talking to camera)
               -- What a night!  Anyone who's
               anyone is here at the premiere of
               "Eternity Forever," but waiting for
               Simone to show may take even
               longer.  We do have her director,
               Viktor Taransky.
                   (ushering him over)
               Viktor, Viktor, is Simone coming?
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (slightly irritated by the
                    focus on the star)
               You know Simone.
     
     Other reporters force their way into the interview.
     
                         PREMIERE REPORTER 2
               I hope she does show up.  Some of
               her fans got here at dawn.  We
               don't want to disappoint them.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (through a pained smile)
               Well, I'm sure they're going to
               love the movie.  I got the
               inspiration --
     
     However, the reporter's attention has strayed.
     
                         PREMIERE REPORTER 2
               HARRY EPSON!
     
     The CAMERAS pivot away from Viktor.  Screen idol, HARRY
     EPSON, is walking up the carpet.
     
                         PREMIERE REPORTER 2
               Harry!  Harry!  Can we have a
               minute?  What brings you here
               tonight?
     
                         HARRY
                   (waving to the fans)
               I just came out to support my good
               friend, Simone.
     
                         PREMIERE REPORTER 2
               There's a rumor that you're more
               than just "good friends"?
     
                         HARRY
                   (slightly irritated by the
                    invasion)
               We've been seeing each other, sure,
               but we'd rather keep our
               relationship private.
     
                         PREMIERE REPORTER 2
                   (believing she has a
                    scoop)
               Do I hear the sound of... wedding
               bells?
     
                         HARRY
                   (suddenly losing it)
               I can't believe you people!  No
               wonder she never comes to these
               things!
     
     Harry angrily pushes the camera away and strides up the
     carpet.
     
     VIKTOR watches him go, flabbergasted.
     
     EXT.  PREMIERE PARTY - NIGHT
     
     A packed, glitzy party.  VIKTOR enters without an escort. 
     Despite his recent rise to prominence he appears strangely
     alone.
     
     He observes ELAINE, champagne in hand, and the younger KENT,
     schmoozing with a group of industry MOVERS and SHAKERS.
     
                         MOVER/SHAKER
               Elaine!  The picture is a
               revelation!
     
                         ELAINE
               Thank you.  I mean, it was a team
               effort --
     
     Viktor cannot resist taking Elaine's photo with a small
     pocket camera.  Elaine is unaware of the shot.
     
     Viktor turns away -- just as Elaine turns to look at him.
     
     Viktor picks up a drink from the bar.  A DRUNK WOMAN, perched
     unsteadily on a nearby barstool, is knocking back Jack
     Daniels.  She accidentally brushes one of her discarded
     glasses off the bar.  Viktor catches it.
     
     A HAND taps Viktor on the shoulder.  HAL stands there
     accompanied by his "Eternity Forever" co-star, MAC.
     
                         HAL
               Is she here?
     
                         VIKTOR
               I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
     
                         HAL
                   (oblivious to his sarcasm)
               Somebody said she was here.
     
     Mac spots the two glasses in Viktor's hands -- one glass
     lipstick-smeared.
     
                         MAC
               Oh my God, that's her glass!
                   (impulsively smelling
                    "Simone's" glass)
               Jack Daniels, straight-up.  She is
               my kind of woman.
     
                         HAL
                   (looking anxiously around
                    the room)
               Viktor, where is she?
     
                         VIKTOR
               She's around.
     
                         MAC
                   (dawning on him, glancing
                    to the far side of the
                    packed room)
               Jesus, Hal... she's in the Ladies
               Room.
     
                         HAL
               You know I sometimes forget she has
               bodily functions.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (unable to resist)
               I know what you mean.
     
                         HAL
                   (anxiously looking to the
                    restroom)
               I have to talk to her about my
               experimental film.  It's very...
               experimental.
     
                         MAC
               Is that her? -- By the fountain.
     
     Far across the party, a WOMAN, with a Simone-type hairstyle,
     her back to us, is standing at the edge of a fountain.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (testy)
               No.  In fact, between us, she
               doesn't really exist.
     
                         HAL
                   (ignoring him, calling out
                    to the woman)
               Simone!
     
                         MAC
               SIMONE!
     
     Several nearby GUESTS, including ELAINE, overhear.  They talk
     over each other.
     
                         GUEST 1
               -- Simone's here!
     
                         ELAINE
                   (slightly the worse for
                    drink)
               -- When did she arrive?  Why didn't
               someone tell me?
     
                         GUEST 2
               -- Where is she?
     
                         MAC
               -- She's by the fountain.
     
                         GUEST 3
               -- Simone, over here!
     
                         GUEST 4
               -- Simone!
     
     The rumor races through the party like wild-fire.  The GUESTS
     surge towards the fountain in a wave of mindless adoration.
     
     The Simone lookalike herself spins around.
     
                         LOOKALIKE WOMAN
               Simone!
     
     She gets knocked into the fountain.  Several other GUESTS
     also fall in the stampede.
     
     Back at the bar, the BARMAN, autograph book in hand, deserts
     his station.  Viktor is left alone with the drunk woman.
     
     LOCAL TV NEWS
     
     The limousines outside the hotel ballroom have been replaced
     with ambulances.  PARAMEDICS tend to GUESTS, bloodied and
     battered in the stampede caused by Simone's "appearance".
     
                         ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
                   (into microphone)
               -- Forget "Eternity Forever", the
               big news tonight was the surprise
               appearance of Simone.  Even these
               seen-it-all superstars are
               apparently not immune to Simone
               fever and the resulting stampede
               forced organizers to bring the
               event to an early end.  I spoke
               with some of the departing guests
               about their encounter with
               Hollywood's most reluctant
               superstar.
     
     CUTS of interviews with VARIOUS bruised GUESTS.
     
                         EXECUTIVE 3
               -- I would say, even more beautiful
               in person, you have to see her to
               believe her.
     
                         MALE GUEST 1
               -- I can't reveal what we spoke
               about.  It was... personal.  Simone
               and I go back a long way.
     
                         FEMALE GUEST 1
               -- When she talks to you, for that
               moment, you are the only other
               human being in the room.
     
                         FEMALE GUEST 2
                   (dress torn)
               -- I really don't know what the
               fuss is about.  So over-rated. 
               She's done one film.  Talk to me
               when she's had the kind of career
               I've had.
     
                         MALE GUEST 2
               -- I do expect her to be nominated,
               yes.

               Fortunately, Simone was not amongst
               the injured and was spirited away
               as mysteriously as she arrived.
     
     EXT.  ECHO OFFICES - DAY
     
     Max Sayer's car is parked outside of the Echo Building.
     
     INT.  ECHO OFFICES - DAY
     
     In the ECHO war room, MAX SAYER is agitated.  He paces back
     and forth, railing at a table of cowering STAFFERS.
     
                         MAX
               -- She goes to a major, Hollywood,
               A-list party and we don't get an
               interview, a comment, we don't even
               get a photograph?  Is that what
               you're telling me?
     
                         ECHO PHOTOGRAPHER

               place he goes, every concierge and
               maitre d' on the take.  But this
               Simone woman is good.

               Obviously the name isn't real --
               she's using an assumed identity,
               travels under a false name, checks
               into hotels with an alias.  She
               never stays in the same place two
               nights in a row.  Anything on the
               satellite photos?

               What about the fingerprints?  What
               happened when we dusted that hotel
               suite?
     
     MILTON holds up a glass taken from the hotel.
     
                         MILTON
               Well, we got some of Taransky's
               fingerprints, a lot of your
               fingerprints... but none of hers.

     CLOSE UP on The Echo magazine -- "CIRCULATION - 12 MILLION".
     
     EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY
     
     "MILLION DOLLAR REWARD FOR PHOTO OF SIMONE!" -- Is the
     headline on the cover of The ECHO.  VIKTOR is reading the
     magazine as he makes his way through the studio lot.
     
     He looks up to see several studio carts parked outside his
     soundstage.  A group of STUDIO EXECUTIVES, led by ELAINE, is
     trying to break into the "CLOSED SET".  VIKTOR runs towards
     the door, throwing himself between the door and the
     executives.
     
                         VIKTOR
               -- You can't go in there!
     
                         ELAINE
               -- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
     
                         EXECUTIVE 1
               -- We know she's in there!
     
     Viktor glares at the SECURITY GUARD who shrugs weakly.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (struggling to hold them
                    back)
               -- Why?  What's all this about?
     
                         EXECUTIVE 2
                   (waving a spreadsheet)
               -- We've got the tracking numbers
               for "Eternity Forever".
     
                         EXECUTIVE 3
               -- They're in the toilet.
     
                         ELAINE
               -- She has to get out there and
               sell the film.
     
                         VIKTOR
               -- What do you want her to do, go
               door-to-door -- ?
     
                         EXECUTIVE 1
               -- Even Garbo would be on the talk
               show circuit if she was alive
               today.

                   (irritated)
               -- It's precisely because she
               doesn't crave the limelight that
               people love her.  I told you, she's
               only about the work.
     
                         EXECUTIVE 3
               -- This is over-shadowing the work!

               That's the problem.  She's more
               famous for her no-shows than her
               shows.
     
                         ELAINE
               -- It's starting to look like she
               doesn't support the film or you,
               Viktor.
                   (trying to squeeze past
                    Viktor)
               If you can't handle her, I will.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (blocking her path)
               Not now.  She's emotional.  Her
               mother dies today.  Scene forty-two
               of "Good For Nothing".  It's not a
               good time.
     
     Elaine and the executives are not convinced, they overpower
     Viktor.
     
                         VIKTOR
               No!  Please, don't go in there!
     
     Too late.  Elaine and the suits force the lock and enter.
     
     INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
     
     ELAINE and the EXECUTIVES stop in their tracks -- confronted
     with the surreal sight of the lone computer station in the
     vast soundstage.  A desperate VIKTOR catches up with them.
     
                         EXECUTIVE 1
               Where is she?
     
                         EXECUTIVE 2
               She's not here.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Elaine... I...
     
     Elaine wanders over to the idle computer with a knowing
     smile.
     
                         ELAINE
               So, the secret's finally out,
               Viktor.
     
                         VIKTOR
               -- I can explain.
     
                         ELAINE
               -- I don't think that's necessary. 
               I think it's perfectly clear.  I
               should have guessed -- it all makes
               sense now... it's why she never
               goes anywhere, never seen in
               public...
     
     Viktor lowers his head, resigned to his fate.
     
                         ELAINE
               She's into computers.
     
     Viktor looks up.
     
                         EXECUTIVE 1
                   (nodding in agreement)

               chat rooms.
     
                         EXECUTIVE 2
               It's the one place she can be
               herself.
     
                         EXECUTIVE 3
               Anonymous.
     
     Viktor seizes on the opportunity.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (adopting a serious tone)
               It's worse than you think.  She's
               extremely agoraphobic -- has a
               morbid fear of people and germs. 
               In a way I'm relieved you... found
               out.
     
     The Executives are taken aback by the shocking revelation.
     
                         VIKTOR
               The premiere was the first time
               I've convinced her to venture out
               and it just confirmed her worst
               nightmares.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (concerned)
               Viktor, you should have said
               something.
     
                         VIKTOR
               She doesn't want pity.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (seeing a new side of
                    Viktor)
               You're so good to protect her like
               this.
     
     Viktor shrugs modestly.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (to the Executives,
                    conceding)
               I'll tell you what.  I know how
               much this means to you.  I'll try
               to get her to plug the film.
                   (beat)
               I'm not promising anything but
               maybe she'll do a talk show --
               taped.
     
                         ELAINE
               Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
     
                         VIKTOR
               I'll try.  Maybe live but remote. 
               She'll never go to them.
     
                         EXECUTIVE 1
               We understand.  Thank you, Viktor.
     
                         EXECUTIVE 2
               Give her our best.
     
     Satisfied, the Executives make their way out of the
     soundstage.
     
                         EXECUTIVE 1
                   (aside to a colleague)
               That agoraphobia -- it's like a
               plague.
     
                         EXECUTIVE 2
               It's out of control in Europe.
     
     Viktor and Elaine are left alone.
     
                         VIKTOR
               I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to
               introduce you to Simone at the
               premiere.  There wasn't time with
               the riot and everything.
                   (picking up a framed photo
                    from the work station)
               But she wanted you to have this.
     
     The photograph shows ELAINE, slightly inebriated at the
     premiere, SIMONE standing slightly behind her.
     
                         ELAINE
               She was there.  She didn't by any
               chance happen to mention me?
     
                         VIKTOR
               She said you were very beautiful.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (flattered)
               Really?
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (blurting out)
               Elaine, what are you doing tonight? 
               Would you like to go somewhere --
               dinner?
     
                         ELAINE
               I'd love to.  But aren't you
               supposed to meet up with Simone?
     
                         VIKTOR
               Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I
               always?
     
     Viktor watches Elaine make her way back to her studio cart.
     
     Viktor realizes he is still holding a copy of the National
     ECHO -- the headline, "MILLION DOLLAR REWARD FOR PHOTO OF
     SIMONE"!  Accompanied by a photo of intrepid reporter MAX
     SAYER.
     
     INT.  SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
     
     An unattended shopping cart, at the end of the frozen foods
     aisle, begins to mysteriously roll towards us.
     
     We discover VIKTOR, pulling the cart with fishing line, while
     at the same time shooting it with a video camera.
     
     INT.  SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
     
     Viktor's home video of the shopping cart plays on a TV. 
     However, now SIMONE is pushing the cart.  She wears
     sunglasses, her hair in curlers under a scarf.  Simone takes
     a Swanson Chicken Pot Pie out of a cabinet... then a box of
     cereal off a display.

                         MILTON
               Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million

     The opening credits to "FRANK BRAND LIVE", a global cable
     show plays against a starscape -- images of famous
     politicians and world leaders interviewed by Frank.
     
                         FRANK BRAND
                   (to camera)
               Tonight on Frank Brand Live --
     
     INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
     
     ELAINE, KENT and LAINEY watch the TV interview in Elaine's
     mansion with eager anticipation.
     
                         FRANK BRAND
               -- Since taking the nation by storm
               with her debut movie, "Sunrise,
               Sunset"...
     
     INT.  MAX SAYER'S OFFICE - THE ECHO - DAY
     
     MAX SAYER and assistant MILTON are also glued to their set.
     
                         FRANK BRAND
               ... no one's managed to land a live
               TV interview with the fabulous, new
               shooting starlet, Simone... until
               now.
     
     INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
     
     Casually tacked up on the monitor is the MILLION DOLLAR CHECK
     from The ECHO.
     
     VIKTOR, face and body scanned by the computer, is making a
     final test of his equipment.  When he touches his hair, bats
     his eyes, moves his hands -- so does Simone.
     
     VIKTOR frantically tests several different backgrounds behind
     SIMONE from a library of images.  Rainforest.  Desert.  Ritzy
     hotel suite.  Moonscape.  Factory.
     
                         SIMONE / VIKTOR
               Make up your mind, Viktor.  Make up
               your mind.
     
     He settles on the desert location.
     
     He also make a last-second change to Simone's wardrobe --
     selecting "TOO-TIGHT SWEATER".
     
     INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
     
     FRANK BRAND talks to camera.
     
                         FRANK BRAND
               I'm happy to say she's agreed to
               join us tonight from the set of her
               new film.
                   (turning to the TV
                    monitor)
               Welcome, Simone.
     
     The just-completed image of SIMONE appears on Brand's
     monitor.
     
                         SIMONE
               Wonderful to be with you, Frank.
     
     INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
     
     KENT, referring to Simone, forgetting or not caring that
     Elaine is in the room.
     
                         KENT
               She is all woman.
     
     LAINEY shoots her mother's boyfriend a withering look.  She
     gets up and leaves the room.
     
     During the interview we cut between Frank Brand's studio,
     Viktor's soundstage and various viewer locations including
     Elaine's mansion, Max Sayer's office and various worldwide
     locations --
     
     A)  A lone AFGHANI SHEPHERD gazing at a Watchman.
     
     B)  A JAPANESE COUPLE watching TV in a capsule hotel room.
     
     C)  A CATHOLIC CARDINAL watching TV in the Vatican.
     
     INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
     
                         FRANK BRAND
               Well, no one could accuse you of
               being over-exposed, Simone.  Why
               have you stayed so completely out
               of the limelight?
     
                         SIMONE
                   (shrugs)
               I just think actors talk too much. 
               Does the world really want to hear
               your life story just because you've
               got a movie opening Friday?
     
                         FRANK BRAND
               Of course, the only problem with
               shying away from publicity these
               days is that it tends to attract
               more.
     
     VIKTOR is in his element, his effeminate gestures
     frighteningly convincing.
     
                         SIMONE
                   (from TV)
               Don't I know it.  That's the only
               reason I'm here now -- to put the
               attention back where it belongs, on
               Mr. Taransky's film.
     
                         FRANK BRAND
               You don't secretly want the
               attention?
     
                         SIMONE
               I'm not even sure I deserve it. 
               After tonight I'll have almost as
               much screen time on your show as I
               do in my movies.  How is that
               healthy for a performer?
     
     IE.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
     
     LAINEY has turned her back on the TV screen, preferring to
     look through a book.
     
                         SIMONE
                   (from TV)
               Because, you have to understand,
               Frank, these interviews -- none of
               this is real.  Who I am on screen
               and who I really am are two totally
               different people.
     
                         FRANK BRAND
               Who are you really?
     
                         SIMONE
               That's a good question.
                   (beat)
               As Nietzsche said, "Whenever a man
               strives long and hard to appear
               someone else..."
     
                         LAINEY
                   (reading from a bookmarked
                    page, along with Simone)
               "... he ends up finding it is
               difficult to be himself again."
     
                         FRANK BRAND
               Well put.
     
     Lainey regards the name written on the inside page -- "Viktor
     Taransky".
     
     INT.  MAX SAYER'S OFFICE - THE ECHO - DAY
     
     TV playing in the background, MAX and MILTON are hurriedly
     leafing through travel books and scrutinizing maps.
     
                         MAX
                   (focusing on the desert
                    background behind Simone)
               I know where that is... I know...
     
     INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
     
                         FRANK BRAND
               Change of topic.  Simone, you've
               been romantically linked to dozens
               of men in the press -- Mick Jagger,
               Stephen Hawking, Fidel Castro...
               and most recently Viktor Taransky. 
               Is there a Mr. Right in there
               somewhere?
     
                         SIMONE
               I'd rather not discuss my private
               life.
                   (gently)
               But Viktor and I are inseparable.
     
     INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
     
     ELAINE's face drops, slightly hurt.
     
                         KENT
               You dog, Viktor!
     
                         SIMONE
                   (from TV)
               I literally wouldn't be here today
               without him.
     
     INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
     
     VIKTOR accidentally taps his finger on the keyboard in his
     excitement -- the cursor aimed at "TEARS" command.  SIMONE'S
     EYES start to well with tears -- a tear spills from her eye.
     
                         FRANK BRAND
               Would you like a moment, Simone?
     
     Viktor notices, quickly withdrawing his finger -- his
     startled expression instantly imitated by Simone.
     
                         SIMONE
               No, I'm okay.
     
     INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
     
                         FRANK BRAND
               Let's talk about the work that you
               care so much about.
     
                         SIMONE
               Sure.  Where would you like to
               start?
     
                         FRANK BRAND
               How about the nudity?
     
                         SIMONE
               Nudity has just never been an issue
               for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are
               just an option.
     
                         FRANK BRAND
               What exactly was it that attracted
               you to your first two projects?
     
                         SIMONE
                   (unable to resist a smile)
               I suppose the thing I like most
               about the movies I'm in is that
               they're not about special effects.
     
     Frank nods sagely.
     
                         FRANK BRAND
               They're better for it if I may say.
     
     INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
     
     The smile is suddenly wiped off VIKTOR's face by a blinking
     alert:
     
             !!INSUFFICIENT MEMORY TO COMPLETE THIS TASK!!
     
     The pixels that form SIMONE start to break up.  Curiously, it
     is only Simone and not the background that is disintegrating.
     
     INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
     
                         FRANK BRAND
                   (regarding the screen)
               Well, we appear to be experiencing
               satellite difficulties.  In case we
               lose you, Simone, I want to thank
               you --
     
     INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
     
     VIKTOR speaks again, his voice suddenly deeper.
     
                         SIMONE / VIKTOR
               Thank... YOU, FRANK.
     
     In horror Viktor hurriedly pulls the plug.  The feed goes
     blank on Frank Brand's screen.
     
     VIKTOR slumps over his computer in exhaustion.  Since SIMONE
     is still synced to his movements, the partially de-pixelated
     Simone also slumps.
     
     Viktor's cell phone rings.  Viktor picks up.
     
                         VIKTOR / SIMONE
               Hel--
     
     He remembers at the last second to switch off his voice
     synthesizer.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (into phone)
               Hello.
     
     INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
     
     We cut between the two sides of the conversation -- ELAINE on
     the phone, KENT still watching post-interview analysis on the
     TV.
     
                         ELAINE
               -- Viktor, are you with her?  Is
               she there?
     
                         VIKTOR
               No.
     
     An anxious beat.
     
                         ELAINE
               Are you and Simone...
                   (blurting it out)
               ... getting married?
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (taken aback by the
                    suggestion)
               No, of course not!
                   (realizing the
                    significance of the
                    question)
               Why?  Would you care if we were?
     
                         ELAINE
                   (covering, realizing she
                    has given herself away)
               Well, yes.  From a studio point of
               view, it would be better if Simone
               stayed single.
                   (quick change of topic)
               Anyhow, I thought she came across
               great tonight.  Intelligent, well
               informed, a natural.  And touching. 
               She was spectacular.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Thank you.
     
     A pause.
     
                         ELAINE
               Viktor, do you realize you always
               do that?
     
                         VIKTOR
               Do what?
     
                         ELAINE
               Whenever I compliment Simone, you
               take the credit.
     
                         VIKTOR
               I do?
     
                         ELAINE
               Yes, you do...
                   (shrug)
               Anyway, tonight was a good start.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Excuse me?  Start?
     
                         ELAINE
               It's a crowded summer.  We need
               every photo-opp, sound-byte and
               column inch we can get.  Good
               night, Viktor.
     
     Elaine hangs up.  Lainey approaches.
     
                         LAINEY
                   (carefully broaching the
                    subject)
               Mom, do you miss Dad?
     
                         ELAINE
                   (she thinks)
               Sometimes.  But, just when I think
               your father's changing for the
               better, I realize he's as self
               absorbed as ever.  He took the
               credit for Simone tonight.
     
     Lainey, coming to her father's defense, glancing at the
     Nietzsche book in her hand.
     
                         LAINEY
               I think Dad deserves more credit
               than he gets.
     
     INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - LATER THAT NIGHT
     
     VIKTOR watches SIMONE on screen.  He is unusually anxious.
     
     As usual SIMONE is wearing a skimpy, provocative outfit as
     she awaits instructions on the screen.  For some reason
     Viktor becomes irritated by the image.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (to Simone)
               Will you cover yourself up!?
     
     He hits a button.  A thick WOOL COAT clicks over her body.
     
     EXT.  NEW MEXICO DESERT - MORNING
     
     The ECHO newscar streaks through the bronze and purple
     desert.  MAX and his assistant MILTON emerge from the car.
     
                         MAX
               -- I've been here before! -- On my
               honeymoon with my ex-wife.
     
                         MILTON
               Is that why she left you?
     
     Max holds a video print of SIMONE giving her FRANK BRAND
     interview.  He compares her desert location to the one in
     front of him.
     
                         MAX
                   (pointing out a Joshua
                    tree)
               You see, that's the exact same tree
               and in the distance, there's the...
                   (voice trailing away)
               ... mountain.
     
     Sure enough, the Joshua tree is identical but the mountain is
     now obscured by a ten-story Holiday Inn.
     
     Max and Milton are mystified -- they look back at the photo.
     
                         MILTON
               It's a hotel.
     
                         MAX
               I don't understand.
     
                         MILTON
               Could they have built that hotel
               since yesterday?
     
     Max shakes his head, deeply concerned.
     
                         MAX
               Get in the car.
     
     INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
     
     VIKTOR has transformed his soundstage into a one-man
     publicity machine.  The floor is littered with photographs of
     SIMONE in various states of dress and undress.
     
     Using a sophisticated Photoshop computer program, VIKTOR
     constructs magazine spreads out of numerous previous magazine

                   (angrily into phone)
               -- We don't do the photo shoot, you
               don't get the cover... written
               answers to written questions,
               that's right... website interviews,
               no problem.
     
     Viktor calls up a "DANCE OPTION".  Choosing from a HULA
     DANCER, a BELLY DANCER and a CLASSICAL BALLERINA, he removes
     Simone's head and places it on the body of the ballerina. 
     She begins to dance for him.
     
     He uses a program to construct childhood photographs of
     SIMONE and other childhood memorabilia.
     
     He employs backgrounds from numerous on-line library sources.
     With a quick cut and paste he is able to place Simone on a
     beach in San Tropez or a bicycle factory in Calcutta.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (muttering to himself)
               You want exposure, Elaine?  I'll
               give you over-exposure...
     
     INT.  ELAINE'S OFFICE - STUDIO - DAY
     
     ELAINE watches TV in her office.  She cannot change channels
     without finding Simone sitting in a chair giving generic
     answers.
     
     INT.  SIMONE INTERVIEW SET - DAY (ON ELAINE'S TV)
     
                         SIMONE
               I think "Eternity Forever" is my
               finest work.
     
                         SIMONE
               I'm most proud of my work in
               "Eternity Forever".
     
                         SIMONE
               I think people are going to love
               "Eternity Forever".
     
     INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
     
     VIKTOR inspects a cut-out photograph of Simone in "ETERNITY
     FOREVER" costume.  He speaks to the photo.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Forgive me, Simone.
     
     EXT.  FASTFOOD RESTAURANT - DAY
     
     The photograph of Simone is emblazoned on a fast food drink
     cup -- a pyramid of cups promoting "ETERNITY FOREVER" Happy
     Meals.  Beneath the plastic pyramid is a SIMONE action figure
     in a convertible.
     
     INT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU BEACH HOUSE - DAY
     
              "ETERNITY FOREVER" HAS BIG FUTURE AT B.O.!
     
     Screams the banner headline in "Variety".

     Shouts the "Hollywood Reporter".
     
     The trade papers sit on the coffee table in front of VIKTOR
     who reclines on a leather sofa, watching TV, gazing lovingly
     at Simone.
     
     INT.  SIMONE INTERVIEW SET - DAY (ON VIKTOR'S TV)
     
                         SIMONE
               Of course, being a movie star is
               wonderful, but I have so many other
               ways I want to express myself --
     
     INT.  BOOKSTORE - DAY
     
     Various book titles are on display:
     
                 "SIMONE'S FAVORITE SOUTHERN RECIPES"
     
                 "HUMAN:KIND - The POETRY of SIMONE"
     
                      "SIMONE'S 101 WAYS TO JOY"
     
     EXT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
     
     A banner in a window reads.  "In Stock: SIMONE'S EASY-WEAR
     FASHION".  Mannequins model the clothes.
     
     INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
     
     We focus on the screen where VIKTOR types in instructions:
     
       SEARCH: "NUMBER 1 HITS - FEMALE ARTISTS/BILLBOARD CHARTS"
     
       PERIOD: "LAST 40 YEARS"
     
     A list of the Number 1 hits for the last forty years promptly
     appears on the screen along with photographs of the
     artists --
     
     PATSY CLINE, ELLA FITZGERALD, ARETHA FRANKLIN, JANICE JOPLIN,
     CAROL KING, WHITNEY HOUSTON, MADONNA, etc.  Beneath the title
     of each song is a graphic representation of the music --
     "PITCH" and "RESONANCE".
     
     Viktor presses a button: "MORPH".  The audio waves converge.
     
     INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
     
     VIKTOR, wearing headphones, records his composite pop song. 
     As usual when he sings into his microphone, Simone also
     sings.  The catchy song is titled: "(If You Can't Believe In
     Yourself) Believe In Me".
     
     SIMONE APPEARS IN A MUSIC VIDEO.
     
     INT.  RECORD STORE - DAY
     
     The video for SIMONE's song plays on the video wall inside
     the record store.  TEENAGE GIRLS, buying CD's, dance
     adoringly in front of the screen, unaware that they are
     gyrating to the vocals of a middle-aged man.
     
     INSERT - "(If You Can't Believe In Yourself) Believe In Me"
     shoots up the Billboard charts.
     
     EXT.  OCEAN - DAY
     
     CLOSE UP on the name "SIMONE" painted on the stern of a
     luxury yacht.
     
     VIKTOR is at the helm, breathing in the clean air -- at last
     a moment to savor his success.  Simone's hit single plays on
     the yacht's stereo.  He looks at peace.
     
     EXT.  MARINA - DAY
     
     A TOURIST has his arm around SIMONE, having his photograph
     taken.  However, we discover that the Simone is only a
     lifesize cardboard cutout used by a STREET VENDOR to sell
     snapshots.  He also has cardboard cutouts of the POPE and
     ELVIS.
     
     MAX SAYER and MILTON walk by.
     
     Tying up his boat, VIKTOR's mood is abruptly shattered by the
     sight of Max and Milton walking down the pier towards him.
     
                         MAX
               Nice boat, Taransky.
     
                         VIKTOR
               It's a yacht.
     
                         MAX
               I know what you're up to.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (pushing past Max)
               I don't have time for this, Sayer.
     
                         MAX
               I think you do.
                   (holding up his video
                    print of Simone in the
                    desert)
               I know it's a fake.
     
     Viktor freezes.
     
                         MAX
               Got your attention now?
     
     Max compares the shot to one of the current desert location
     with the Holiday Inn in front of the mountain.
     
                         MAX
                   (referring to the
                    photographs)
               It's bogus.  You used an old
               library shot for the background.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (ashen)
               The background is.
     
                         MAX
               She was never in New Mexico.  She
               never left the studio.
     
     Viktor is relieved that Max is only accusing him of faking
     the background.
     
                         MAX
                   (referring to a large
                    bundle of other shots
                    under his arm)
               I've done my homework.  I've
               studied her.
     
                         VIKTOR
               -- I bet you have.
     
                         MAX
               -- I've looked at every piece of
               publicity she's ever done, the
               video in the supermarket, there's
               no evidence she's ever left the
               studio.
                   (afterthought)
               Oh, and for some reason this woman
               leaves no paper trail.  But I have
               "obtained" a copy of your bank
               accounts.  I know you have power of
               attorney but so far you haven't
               transferred one single solitary
               cent to her.
     
                         VIKTOR
               I'm keeping it in trust.
     
                         MAX
               I know that's what you'd like us to
               believe.  But I got to tell you --
               embezzlement is a serious matter. 
               Not to mention abduction.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Abduction?
     
                         MAX
               I don't buy the whole recluse scam. 
               How are you doing it?  What is it --
               drugs?  Blackmail?  Mind-control? 
               All three?  What do you do -- keep
               her locked in a box somewhere?
     
     Viktor flinches at the remark.
     
                         VIKTOR
               What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
     
                         MAX
               I want to see her.  Unless you show
               me Simone live and in person I show
               these pictures to the authorities.
     
     Viktor pauses, considering the threat.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
     
                         MAX
               Er,... good.
     
                         MILTON
               That's good.
     
     Viktor walks away leaving Max confused.
     
     The breeze whips the photos of SIMONE out of Max's hands and
     into the sea.
     
     INT.  CONCERT STADIUM - DUSK
     
     A vast, empty stadium.  On the stage, a lone microphone. 
     VIKTOR approaches, gazing out at the vast arena.  Several
     PROMOTERS and TECHNICIANS join him.
     
                         PROMOTER
               All ready, Mr. Taransky.  This time
               tomorrow night, she'll be standing
               right here in front of a packed
               house.  We could have sold it out
               twenty times.
     
     Viktor nods.
     
                         TECHNICIAN
               Soundcheck went perfect.  Laser
               show ready to go.
                   (cautionary note)
               I gotta say, you ordered an awful
               lot of smoke.
     
                         VIKTOR
               That's the way she likes it.
     
     The Promoter glancing to the area in front of the stage,
     where a barrier has been erected.
     
                         PROMOTER
               After what you told us about the
               death threats, the security guards
               are under strict instructions never
               to take their eyes off the crowd.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Excellent.
     
     Viktor hands each man a headshot of SIMONE signed with a
     kiss.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Simone wanted you to have these.
     
                         TECHNICIAN
                   (visibly moved by the
                    gesture)
               Wish her luck from us.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Oh, I will.
                   (afterthought)
               Remember, no cameras, no
               binoculars.
     
     EXT.  STADIUM - NIGHT
     
     In the shadow of the enormous stadium sits a control
     truck/tour bus, satellite dishes on the roof -- the lights
     from the laser-show inside the arena play off the truck.  The
     control truck shakes from the stomping of the crowd.
     
                         CROWD
               ... SI-MONE!  SI-MONE!  SI-MONE!...
     
     The door to the truck is marked, "SIMONE - Splendid Isolation
     Tour.  NO ENTRY".
     
     INT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
     
     VIKTOR sits alone at the mixing panel of a control truck.  On
     his monitors, a sea of humanity, chanting.
     
                         CROWD
               ... SI-MONE!  SI-MONE!  SI-MONE!...
     
     Viktor produces the "SIMULATION ONE" hard-drive from his
     jacket pocket and inserts it into the computer.
     
     SIMONE appears on the monitor.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Let's get you into hair and make
               up.
     
     Simone's hair rapidly grows in a number of styles, eyelashes
     grow and are trimmed, eyeshadow of various shades paints
     across the lids.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Wardrobe.
     
     Viktor tries several outfits on Simone -- the clothes
     appearing to fabricate themselves on her body.  He settles
     for the most provocative outfit.
     
     Finger poised over the keyboard, Viktor glances to a monitor
     showing --
     
     INT.  STADIUM - CROWD - NIGHT
     
     ELAINE and LAINEY amongst the crowd, clapping their hands,
     stomping their feet and chanting.
     
     INT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
     
                         VIKTOR
               Easier to make one hundred thousand
               believe than just one.
     
     He scrolls to a program, marked "HOLOGRAM" and pushes the
     "ENTER" key.
     
     INT.  STADIUM - CONCERT STAGE - NIGHT
     
     Smoke fills the stage.  A strobe light show plays.  A booming
     ANNOUNCER is heard.
     
                         ANNOUNCER
               Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor
               Taransky Promotions is proud to
               present, live on stage, for the
               debut concert of the "Splendid
               Isolation" tour, the one, the only,
               SI-MONE!
     
     A spotlight falls on the solitary figure of Simone, standing
     alone on the stage with a guitar over her shoulder (the only
     accompaniment) -- dwarfed by the huge stage.  However, on
     closer inspection, the spotlight is actually a laser beam
     creating a hologram.  Clouds of smoke and strobe lighting aid
     the illusion.
     
     The only clear view of Simone for the audience is provided by
     the enormous video screens on either side of the stage.  The
     CROWD stares up at the jumbotrons, blissfully unaware that
     they are watching a pre-recorded event.  Some watch the event
     on portable TVs.
     
     INT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
     
     CLOSE UP on the computer screen.  VIKTOR scrolls down a list
     of options -- "... HOUSTON, MIAMI, NEW YORK, L.A...."
     
                         SIMONE
                   (from on stage)
               I love you...
     
     He selects "L.A.".
     
                         SIMONE
               ... L.A.
     
     The crowd roars its approval.
     
                         SIMONE
               It's great to be here.
     
     INT.  STADIUM - CONCERT STAGE - NIGHT
     
     SIMONE -- her voice a seamless blend of several DIVAS --
     begins to sing her hit song, "(If You Can't Believe In
     Yourself) Believe In Me".  A verse of the song is sung in
     perfect Spanish.
     
     EXT.  VARIOUS LOCATIONS - NIGHT/DAY
     
     A)  On a jumbotron in Tokyo SIMONE's concert plays LIVE.
     
     B)  On a TV set on a West African beach, children dance to
         SIMONE.
     
     C)  On a computer in a Bombay taxi, the driver and his
         passengers gyrate to SIMONE webcast.
     
     INT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
     
     VIKTOR's face is reflected in a monitor showing a frenzied
     crowd gazing up at the jumbotron -- singing along, many in
     tears, overcome with emotion -- holding cigarette lighters
     aloft.  For a moment Viktor is in awe of his own wizardry --
     the grand illusionist.  Viktor is at the height of his
     powers.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (to the image of Simone on
                    his screen)
               I don't know about you, Simone, but
               I've never felt more alive.
     
     He snaps back to reality just in time to notice that the
     Simone hologram beam has wandered through her own microphone
     stand.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Damn!
     
     He adjusts the beam -- the rapturous crowd, transfixed by the
     TV screen, apparently fails to notice.
     
     INT.  STADIUM - CROWD - NIGHT
     
     We focus on a face in the crowd -- MAX SAYER.  His
     journalistic assignment temporarily forgotten, Max is singing
     along and waving his arms, tears rolling down his face, swept
     up in the moment.
     
     INT.  STADIUM - CONCERT STAGE - NIGHT
     
     SIMONE finishes her final number.
     
                         SIMONE
               Good-night.  Never stop believing.
     
     EXT.  STADIUM - EXIT - NIGHT
     
     A bin contains dozens of confiscated cameras and binoculars. 
     FANS exit the stadium through a tunnel.
     
     S-I-M-O-N-E is spelt out on the bare chests of six TEENAGE
     BOYS.  Other FANS wear "SIMONE - Splendid Isolation Tour"
     T-shirts and carry posters.  Several CONCERT GOERS speak to a
     TV NEWS CREW.
     
                         FAN 1
               -- I swear, she looked right at me.
     
                         FAN 2
               -- She was, like, ethereal.
     
                         FAN 3
               -- One moment she seemed to walk
               right through her mike stand like
               it wasn't even there.
     
     INT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
     
     The chanting crowd can be heard exiting.  VIKTOR, wearing
     lipstick is hastily signing a pile of souvenir programs with
     Simone's signature kiss.
     
     He is interrupted by a knock at the door.  Viktor irritably
     opens it.
     
                         VIKTOR
               I said I didn't want to be
               interrupt --
     
     EXT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
     
     ELAINE and LAINEY stand at the foot of the trailer, a
     SECURITY GUARD nearby.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (face brightening)
               My two favorite girls.
     
                         ELAINE
               Lainey and I just wanted to
               congratulate...
     
     Regarding Viktor closely, Elaine's smile evaporates.
     
                         ELAINE
               ... Simone.
     
                         VIKTOR
               She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (suddenly cool)
               I can imagine.
     
     Viktor is confused by their reaction.  Elaine yanks Lainey
     away.
     
                         ELAINE
               Thank Simone for the tickets.
     
                         LAINEY
                   (calling back as she is
                    led away)
               It was a great show, Dad...
     
     Viktor waves disconcertedly.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Where are you... going?
     
     As he returns to the trailer, Viktor catches sight of his
     lipstick-smeared mouth in the mirror on the inside of the
     trailer door.  He slams the side of the trailer in
     frustration.
     
     INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - NIGHT
     
     ELAINE paces back and forth in front of her TV showing re-
     runs of the SIMONE concert.  KENT cannot take his eyes off
     the screen.
     
                         ELAINE
               I can't believe she's doing this --
               taking advantage of him this way. 
               It's cruel.
     
                         KENT
               Why?
     
                         ELAINE
               Obviously, this can't last.  She's
               going to dump him.  Viktor won't be
               able to take that.  He's too
               sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
     
                         KENT
               Elaine, do you realize you can't
               stop talking about Viktor?
     
                         ELAINE
                   (not hearing)
               I have to talk to her.
     
     Kent switches off the TV.
     
                         KENT
               I've been meaning to talk to you.
     
     Behind the open door, we find LAINEY eavesdropping.
     
     EXT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - BEACH - DAY
     
     VIKTOR, deep in thought, stands at the water's edge, staring
     at the breaking waves.  LAINEY joins him.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Hey, Lainey.
                   (gently teasing her)
               How's your love life?
     
                         LAINEY
               I do okay.  How about you?
     
                         VIKTOR
               You know me -- married to my work.
     
                         LAINEY
               I noticed.
     
     An awkward silence.
     
                         LAINEY
               Dad, you know I don't like to get
               between you and mom but she's
               feeling down right now.  She broke
               up with Kent.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (buoyed by the news)
               Really?  Too bad.
     
                         LAINEY
               She thinks you're with Simone.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Lainey, you know Simone and I don't
               have a real relationship.
     
                         LAINEY
               I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if
               it came from Simone, if Simone
               spoke to Mom -- she could
               straighten things out.
                   (shrug)
               Dinner, maybe.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A
               phone call?
     
                         LAINEY
               Too impersonal.  They have to meet
               face-to-face.
     
                         VIKTOR
               I'll see what I can do.
                   (a thought occurs)
               You know, Lainey.  I don't believe
               you've ever once asked to meet
               Simone.  Don't you like her?
     
                         LAINEY
               I love her but that doesn't mean I
               need to meet her.
     
     Viktor is confused.
     
                         LAINEY
               Why?  So I can tell my friends at
               school -- as if that validates my
               life somehow.  What's Simone going
               to say to a fourteen-year-old
               anyhow?  She's going to be polite
               because you're my father but we're
               not suddenly going to become
               friends -- we have nothing in
               common.  It's not going to be real. 
               Anyhow, she gets more beautiful in
               my head every day.  Why kill the
               dream?  What do they say, "don't
               get too close to your idols, they
               always disappoint you".
     
     Viktor gazes in wonder at his daughter, so much wiser than
     her years.
     
                         VIKTOR
               I love you, Lainey.
     
                         LAINEY
               I love you too, daddy.
     
     A car horn sounds outside the house.
     
                         LAINEY
               That's Mom.
                   (kissing him on the
                    forehead)
               See you.
     
     She exits, leaving Viktor deep in thought.
     
     EXT.  LOS ANGELES FREEWAY - DAY
     
     Milli Vanilli's "GIRL YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE" plays on a car
     radio.  ELAINE, wearing a red power suit, drives home along
     the freeway in bumper-to-bumper traffic.  Her car phone
     rings.  She turns down the radio and picks up.
     
                         ELAINE
               Hello?
     
                         SIMONE
               Hello, is this Elaine?
     
                         ELAINE
               Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you,
               Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk
               to you.
     
                         SIMONE
               Well, here I am.
                   (beat)
               You look pretty today.  Red suits
               you.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (looking around the
                    freeway)
               Where are you?
     
                         SIMONE
               Right beside you.  I borrowed
               Viktor's car.
     
     Elaine looks to the inside lane.  SIMONE, wearing sunglasses,
     phone to her ear, drives alongside.  Simone waves, somewhat
     mechanically.  Elaine waves back.  They keep driving as they
     talk.
     
     INT.  VIKTOR'S CAR - DAY
     
     The sunglasses-clad SIMONE is a mannequin, seated in the
     driver's seat with her left hand on the phone obscuring her
     mouth, right hand attached to the steering wheel.
     
     Seat fully-reclined on the passenger side, VIKTOR drives the
     car by stretching a foot across to the pedals and steering
     with one hand, occasionally sneaking a glance to the road
     ahead.  He speaks on a phone through the Simone synthesizer.
     
                         SIMONE / VIKTOR
               I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm
               late.  I'm on my way to see Viktor
               now.
     
                         ELAINE
               No, I understand.  That's what I
               want to talk about.  I don't know
               if you know this, Simone, but
               Viktor and I were married once.
     
                         SIMONE / VIKTOR
               I can't imagine how you ever let a
               man like that go.  I owe Viktor
               everything.
     
                         ELAINE
               I think he owes more to you.  But
               that's not important now.  I know
               what's going on between you two.
     
                         SIMONE / VIKTOR
               I want to reassure you, Elaine,
               there's absolutely nothing going on
               between Viktor and I.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (rueful smile)
               You don't have to protect my
               feelings, Simone.  I don't blame
               Viktor for falling in love with the
               most desirable woman in the world.
     
                         SIMONE / VIKTOR
                   (breaking character)
               I'm not --
                   (correcting himself)
               He's not.
     
     Viktor, losing concentration on his driving, drifts across
     his lane, almost striking Elaine's car -- swerving back at
     the last second.
     
                         ELAINE
               My God, are you alright, Simone?
     
                         SIMONE / VIKTOR
               Damn --
                   (struggling to stay in
                    her/his lane)
               Yes -- I --
                   (regaining control)
               -- I'm just a little tired. 
               Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I --
               it's strictly a working
               relationship.  We could never be
               anything else.  We're just so...
               different.
     
                         ELAINE
               Exactly.  You're a household name
               now.  You're moving in entirely
               different worlds.  That's why I
               hope you're not toying with Viktor.
     
                         SIMONE / VIKTOR
               It sounds like you still have
               feelings for him.
     
                         ELAINE
               We have a daughter together.  I
               just don't want to see Viktor get
               hurt.
     
                         SIMONE / VIKTOR
               I don't know how many times I have
               to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and
               I are not in love.
                   (joking weakly)
               I only make love to the camera.
     
                         ELAINE
               Simone, I recognize the shirt
               you're wearing.  I gave it to
               Viktor on his birthday.
     
     Over-correcting his steering, Viktor drifts into the next
     lane, dangerously close to a pick-up truck that has to swerve
     to avoid him.
     
                         SIMONE / VIKTOR
               Christ --
                   (still struggling to stay
                    on the road)
               Elaine, I know how it looks but...
                   (blurting it out)
               ... it would mean a lot to Viktor
               if you'd go with him to the Oscars. 
               If you won't do it for him, please
               do it for me.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (reluctant, frightened by
                    Simone's erratic driving)
               Okay -- for you.
     
                         SIMONE / VIKTOR
                   (sigh of relief)
               Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
     
                         ELAINE
               I'm glad we talked.
     
                         SIMONE / VIKTOR
               Good-bye.
     
     Viktor's car swerves to the right.  Elaine looks back in her
     rearview mirror, concerned.
     
     Elaine just misses the sight of VIKTOR's car rear-ending the
     truck in front of him.
     
     EXT.  FREEWAY SHOULDER - LATER IN THE DAY
     
     VIKTOR anxiously watches a HIGHWAY PATROLMAN writing up the
     fender-bender.  However, the Patrolman is more interested in
     the Simone mannequin.
     
                         PATROLMAN
               You don't have to explain.  I know
               what the press is like.  Lunatics. 
               Out of control.
                   (referring to the Simone
                    mannequin)
               You do know I'm going to have to
               take this?
     
     INT.  ACADEMY AWARDS - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
     
     VIKTOR, in his tuxedo, sits in the front row of the packed
     auditorium beside an empty seat -- "RESERVED for SIMONE". 
     ELAINE and LAINEY sit alongside -- LOTUS and MAC nearby.
     
     HAL stands at the transparent plastic podium with the "Best
     Actress" envelope.
     
                         HAL
               And the winner is...
     
     Hal tears the envelope's seal, momentarily confused as he
     reads the name.
     
                         HAL
               Actually, there's a tie.
     
     The AUDIENCE gasps.
     
                         HAL
                   (milking the moment for
                    all it's worth)
               The winners are... Simone for
               "Sunrise, Sunset"...
     
     The audience cheers enthusiastically, but Hal stills their
     applause.
     
                         HAL
                   (big smile)
               ... and Simone for "Eternity
               Forever".
     
     The audience erupts.  Viktor accepts the congratulations of
     those around him.
     
                         HAL
               Unfortunately, Simone can't be with
               us tonight.
                   (turning to the screen)
               But thanks to the miracle of modern
               technology she is able to join us
               live via satellite from the
               location of her new film.
     
     The screen flickers to life.
     
     ON SCREEN - A DESOLATE WASTELAND - DAY
     
     SIMONE sits in a director's chair in the desolate wasteland
     location chosen by Viktor.
     
                         SIMONE
               Thank you!  Thank you!  This means
               so much to me.  I'm just sorry I
               can't be there with you.
                   (wiping away a tear)
               First off I have to acknowledge my
               fellow nominees -- I don't even
               feel I belong in the best actress
               category let alone with these...
               wonderful human beings.
                   (composing herself)
               I also have to thank my co-stars,
               the studio, of course.  But most of
               all, I have to thank the audience
               for supporting what I do -- you're
               the only reason I'm here.
     
     The CROWD applauds wildly.
     
     LAINEY is puzzled.  She leans over to Viktor.
     
                         LAINEY
               Why didn't she thank you?
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (confused)
               She did... didn't she?
     
                         ELAINE
                   (crestfallen)
               No.
     
     Viktor glances to the "Simone" sign beside him.  The blood
     drains from his face.
     
     INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - MORNING
     
     On the monitor, SIMONE reads the forgotten line from the
     speech.
     
                         SIMONE
               ... And of course I must thank my
               collaborator, Viktor Taransky,
               without whom none of this would be
               possible.
     
     VIKTOR, still in his tuxedo, stares at SIMONE on the screen. 
     He holds the text of Simone's acceptance speech in his hands.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (to himself)
               It's written right there... Why
               didn't I say it?... How could I
               forget to say it?
     
     Simone stares back at him blankly.
     
     A copy of VARIETY is slid under the soundstage door.  The
     front page headline, "NO THANK YOU - Simone Snubs Taransky At
     Oscars".
     
     INT.  VIKTOR'S CAR - NIGHT
     
     VIKTOR pulls up to the gate of his Malibu home.  MAX is
     standing outside next to his car.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Damn it!
     
     EXT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOME - NIGHT
     
     VIKTOR also spies an OLD WOMAN in a wheelchair sitting beside
     the car, MILTON closeby.  Viktor stops at the gate and
     reluctantly exits his car.
     
                         VIKTOR
               What now, Sayer?
     
                         MAX
                   (smug smile, noticing
                    Viktor noticing the
                    woman)
               Looks familiar, doesn't she?  No
               one comes from nowhere, Taransky. 
               You turn over enough rocks...
     
     The old woman appears drugged, stares into space.
     
                         MAX
               I traced her to a nursing home.  A
               young woman fitting Simone's
               description dropped her off five
               years ago.
     
                         VIKTOR
               She looks a lot like you.
     
                         MAX
                   (undeterred)
               She hasn't uttered a word that
               whole time -- until she saw the big
               show.
     
     Max produces a shot of SIMONE at the Oscars and holds it in
     front of the old lady.
     
                         OLD LADY
                   (pointing to Simone's
                    picture, catatonic)
               My baby... My baby...
     
                         MAX
                   (putting his hand on his
                    heart)
               Who would think that "Saint Simone"
               would abandon her own mother?  I've
               been looking into the family
               history -- heartbreaking.  Most
               likely a biography to run over four
               issues... who knows, maybe there's
               a Pulitzer in there somewhere.
     
     Viktor produces his own driver's license and holds it in
     front of the old lady.
     
                         OLD LADY
                   (pointing to Viktor's face
                    on the driver's license)
               My baby... My baby...
     
     Max hastily steps between Viktor and the Old Lady.
     
                         MAX
               That doesn't prove a thing -- wait
               until I get a court order for a
               blood test.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (sensing an opportunity)
               That won't be necessary.
                   (pretending to be
                    resigned)
               Sooner or later I knew you'd crack
               this thing, Max.  You got me.
     
                         MAX
               I do?
                   (recovering)
               Sure I do.
                   (taking Viktor aside)
               Can we speak off the record?  I'm a
               fair man.  I'm willing to sit down
               with her and tell her side of the
               story.
     
                         VIKTOR
               I wouldn't want you to compromise
               your ethics.
     
                         MAX
               No.  Thanks.  Absolutely.
     
     Viktor regards the newshound with a look of pity.
     
                         VIKTOR
               You love her, don't you, Max?
     
                         MAX
               Don't you?
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (writes a check, hands it
                    to Max)
               This should take care of Mother.
     
     Viktor drives into his home.  Max, very confused, stares at
     the old lady.
     
     EXT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
     
     VIKTOR escorts LAINEY, blindfolded, around the corner of his
     soundstage.  He removes the blindfold.  From Lainey's point-
     of-view we see the sportscar Simone drove in "ETERNITY
     FOREVER" -- the car tied with a bow.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you
               like it?
     
                         LAINEY
                   (taking in the car)
               It's fantastic -- it's too much.
     
                         VIKTOR
               It's the car she drove in "Eternity
               Forever".
     
                         LAINEY
               I know.  Thank her for me.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (disappointed by her
                    reaction)
               It's from both of us.  Of course
               you'll have to drive it around the
               lot until you get your permit --
     
     Lainey averts her gaze.
     
                         LAINEY
               -- I can't accept it.  I don't want
               a car, Dad.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (clearly hurt, not
                    understanding)
               Why not?  I can get you something
               else.  What do you want?
     
                         LAINEY
               The old Viktor Taransky.
                   (finally blurting it out)
               I liked you better before -- before
               all this.  You were a loser, Dad,
               but at least you had integrity.  I
               can't stand to see you like this --
               clinging to Simone's coattails --
               it used to be about the work, and
               now it's all about her.  And then
               she's not even grateful enough to
               thank you.
     
                         VIKTOR
               No, that was me.
     
                         LAINEY
               There you go again, blaming
               yourself.  Can't you see what she's
               done to you -- she's taking
               advantage, mocking you.  You
               deserve better than Simone.
                   (hasty exit)
               I've got to go, Dad.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Lainey...
     
     Viktor watches Lainey depart towards the studio gates.
     
     INT.  SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
     
     VIKTOR leans on his desk, still reflecting on LAINEY's
     remarks.  JANE enters.
     
                         JANE
               Ready for your casting session?
     
     Viktor nods distractedly.  Jane shows in NICOLA ANDERS.
     
                         JANE
               Nicola's here for the role of
               Simone's sister.
     
     Viktor offers Nicola a seat, staring at her as if he has
     never truly looked at her before -- she has a quality of
     Simone.
     
                         NICOLA
                   (slightly uncomfortable by
                    Viktor's scrutiny)
               A lot's happened since we last saw
               each other.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (numb)
               Yes.
     
                         NICOLA
               I never apologized properly for
               what happened on "Sunrise".
     
     She hands Viktor a peace offering -- a large jar of Mike &
     Ike candy, including cherry.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Thank you.  It's not important.
     
                         NICOLA
               After I saw what Simone did with
               the role -- you know I fired all my
               people, went into rehab, took
               acting classes, changed my whole
               look.  She really inspired me.
     
     Viktor continues to stare.
     
                         NICOLA
                   (referring to the script
                    in her hands)
               Would you like me to read?
     
                         VIKTOR
               Yes, I'd like that.
     
     Nicola glances at the script a last time and puts it down. 
     She approaches Viktor, standing close to him, playing the
     scene to him -- an immediate intimacy.
     
                         NICOLA
                   (her angry words are in
                    opposition to her amorous
                    actions)
               -- Who do you think you are, Carlos
               -- coming in here like this?  With
               my husband sleeping in the next
               room.  Do you think I won't call
               out?  Do you think I will just give
               in to you without a fight -- like
               the last time and the time before
               that?
                   (she kisses his ear)
               I wish you were dead.
                   (she kisses his lips)
               I wish we were both dead.
     
     Nicola immediately breaks character.
     
     Viktor is mesmerized -- he has fallen back in love with
     flesh.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (finally able to speak)
               You know you're really very good. 
               I take back what I said.  I mean,
               you're really good.
     
                         NICOLA
               Thank you.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (forgetting himself)
               You could play the lead.
     
                         NICOLA
                   (confused)
               But that's Simone's part.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Yes, of course it is.
                   (gazing at her face)
               You know you have a line here.  Not
               a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a
               dimple.  I've been thinking of
               incorporating something like that
               in Simone.
     
                         NICOLA
                   (incredulous)
               You'd cosmetically alter Simone to
               look like me?
     
                         VIKTOR
               No, of course not, you're right. 
               That would be crazy.
     
     Viktor sits back down and stares out of the window.
     
                         NICOLA
               Do you want me to do it again?
     
     Viktor does not reply.  Nicola quietly leaves.
     
     INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
     
     The front page of "Variety" is dominated by a large
     photograph of SIMONE giving her acceptance speech via
     satellite.  However, ELAINE is gazing at a small inset
     picture of VIKTOR, HERSELF and LAINEY arriving at the Oscar
     Ceremony.
     
     Elaine tears out the photo and slips it into her purse.
     
     EXT.  SWIMMING POOL - DAY (ON VIKTOR'S SCREEN)
     
     Old home video of ELAINE.  She is in a garden by a swimming
     pool, laughing, waving and sweetly flirting with the camera. 
     Elaine raises her skirt teasingly, winks, gestures the camera
     operator towards her with a beckoning finger, finally blows a
     kiss to the camera.
     
     INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
     
     While the ever-seductive SIMONE waits patiently on-screen for
     Viktor's instructions, VIKTOR is gazing at the smaller
     monitor -- the home video of ELAINE.
     
     Viktor freezes the tape.  Elaine appears particularly
     beautiful.
     
     Viktor electronically cuts out Elaine's mannerism and morphs
     it into Simone.  Now Simone blows the kiss and has the same
     dazzling smile.
     
     INT.  SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
     
     At her desk, JANE is busy trying to mimic Simone's hairstyle
     as she talks on the phone.
     
                         JANE
                   (into phone)
               -- Oh sure, she comes in all the
               time... we've become close.  She
               told me --
     
     VIKTOR enters the office.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Jane --
     
     Jane hurriedly hangs up.
     
                         JANE
               Gotta go.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (picking up a pile of
                    scripts from the in-tray)
               I'm leaving early tonight.  If you
               need me I'll be at the beach house
               having dinner with a... certain
               someone.
     
     Jane tries to conceal her interest.  As soon as Viktor exits
     the office, JANE picks up the phone.
     
                         JANE
                   (into phone, under her
                    breath)
               ... Elaine Christian please.
     
     We reveal VIKTOR, outside the door, eavesdropping on his
     assistant, pleased she has taken the bait.
     
     INT.  VIKTOR'S BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT
     
     VIKTOR dims the lights, plays "mood" music.  The doorbell
     rings.
     
     He checks himself in the mirror.  In the reflection, he spies
     an autographed photo of HIMSELF with his arm around SIMONE. 
     He hurriedly hides the photo and answers the door.
     
     ELAINE stands there.
     
                         ELAINE
               Viktor, I'm picking up Lainey.
     
     Elaine is over-dressed for her supposed errand.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Elaine, it's Wednesday.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (feigning absent
                    mindedness)
               Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. 
               How embarrassing.  I don't know
               what I was thinking.  With all the
               excitement lately...
                   (peering past him)
               Am I interrupting something?  Are
               you expecting company?
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (ushering her inside)
               As a matter-of-fact I am.
     
                         ELAINE
               When is she coming over?
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (glancing to his watch)
               About now.  Would you like a drink?
     
                         ELAINE
               I suppose I could stay, just until
               she arrives.
     
     Elaine takes a seat on the sofa.  Viktor hands her a glass of
     wine and sits beside her -- close.
     
     They both knock back their wine in one long gulp, both
     apparently in need of courage.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (trying to make
                    conversation)
               Is Simone back to earth yet?
     
                         VIKTOR
               Not quite.
     
                         ELAINE
               I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. 
               She's lucky to have you, Viktor.
                   (blurting out)
               Is she really having your baby?
     
                         VIKTOR
               Impossible.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (instantly regretting the
                    remark)
               I just read somewhere --
     
                         VIKTOR
               I know.  I know.  They'll say
               anything.
     
                         ELAINE
               -- And she was positively glowing
               at the awards.
                   (making to leave)
               I should be going, she'll be here
               soon --
     
     Viktor puts his finger to her lips to hush her.
     
                         VIKTOR
               -- She already is.  Simone's not
               coming over, Elaine.  Not tonight,
               not ever.
                   (holding her)
               I want you back, Elaine.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (melting)
               I want you back too, Viktor.
     
     They kiss.  Elaine breaks the kiss, suddenly consumed with
     doubt.
     
                         ELAINE
               This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? 
               I can't compete with Simone.  What
               woman can?
     
                         VIKTOR
               I would rather have you than
               Simone.  Believe me.
     
                         ELAINE
               That's sweet, Viktor, but I
               couldn't let you do that -- make
               that kind of sacrifice.
                   (meeting his gaze)
               It's strange.  I've stabbed people
               in the back, clawed and slept my
               way to where I am -- it goes with
               the territory -- but, for some
               reason, I can't betray Simone. 
               There's... I don't know any other
               way to say it -- there's a goodness
               to her.
     
                         VIKTOR
               No, there isn't.  There's nothing
               to her.
     
                         ELAINE
               Oh, Viktor.  You say that now --
               because we're here, alone, like
               this.  But in the morning, you'd go
               back to her.  What man wouldn't?
     
                         VIKTOR
               No, I will end my relationship with
               her -- totally.
     
                         ELAINE
               But you don't understand.  She'll
               always be there -- at some party,
               on some magazine cover, some song
               on the radio, up on some screen.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (desperate)
               No.  She'll never work again --
               retire, never make a movie or a
               record, or appear ever again.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (confused)
               Of course she will.  Her public
               will demand it.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Not if I don't let her.
     
                         ELAINE
               You?
     
     Viktor knocks back another glass of wine for courage.
     
                         VIKTOR
               I'm going to tell you a secret now,
               Elaine.
                   (mustering all his nerve)
               Simone is not a real person.  I
               invented her.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (misinterpreting his
                    remark)
               Every actor is an invention,
               Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. 
               No one's denying that you
               discovered Simone.  But it's like
               finding a diamond in the desert. 
               Anyone can trip over it, but it's
               not the finder who sparkles.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (agitated)
               -- No, no, I didn't trip over her. 
               You don't understand --
     
                         ELAINE
                   (ignoring him)
               -- You just got lucky that she's
               loyal enough to stay with you. 
               Maybe she's staying out of pity,
               who knows?  She certainly doesn't
               need you.  Some people even say
               you're holding her back.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (wounded)
               Who says that -- ?
                   (shaking off the insult)
               -- Never mind.  You have to listen
               to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air,
               pixels, molded by me from a
               mathematical equation.  I inherited
               it from a madman -- I can show
               you --
     
                         ELAINE
               How much wine have you had?
     
                         VIKTOR
               -- She's a figment of my own
               imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky,
               have perpetrated the greatest hoax,
               the greatest sleight-of-hand,
               sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of-
               sleight in entertainment history!
               And still no one appreciates me,
               recognizes what I've done -- even
               you.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (rolling her eyes)
               You're drunker than I thought.  Are
               you doing that again?
     
                         VIKTOR
               No!  Whatever talent Simone has
               comes from me -- me!  Me!  I swear,
               as God is my judge.  You don't know
               what I've been through.  Tens of
               thousands of mind-numbing hours in
               front of that screen, nights
               without end, and look what it's
               cost me.
                   (producing his spectacles)
               Why do you think I've been wearing
               these?  I may have done irreparable
               harm to my eyesight, and why?  To
               extract and refine the infinite
               nuances of a human being -- a human
               soul.
                   (a final explanation)
               Don't you see?  I made Simone!
     
     A pause.  His words hang in the air.
     
                         ELAINE
               You made Simone?
                   (a trace of pity)
               Viktor, she made you.
     
     Elaine gets up and walks out, leaving the distraught Viktor
     alone in his house.
     
     INT.  VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
     
     A hung-over VIKTOR enters his office.  Suddenly, he stops and
     confronts the standee of SIMONE.
     
                         VIKTOR
               You bitch!  I'll destroy you!
     
     JANE stares in shock.  She discreetly exits.
     
     INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
     
     VIKTOR sits in front of his monitor, smiling venomously at
     SIMONE.  He begins to digitally disrobe Simone.
     
     MONTAGE:
     
     A)  Peering through a gap in the drapes of his Malibu house,
         VIKTOR watches MAX dig through his trash.  Max finds a
         beat up reel of 16mm film.
     
         MAX holds the end up to the light -- his eyes pop.
     
     B)  The ECHO headline screams, "SIMONE'S HARD CORE PAST" and
         shows censored film frames of a naked Simone in a
         compromising position.
     
         VIKTOR, hovering at a supermarket check-out line,
         overhears two WOMEN discussing the article.
     
                         WOMAN 1
               Disgusting...
     
                         WOMAN 2
                   (sympathetic)
               She must have been so desperate to
               do something like that, so
               depraved.
     
                         WOMAN 1
               I'm still naming my baby after her.
     
                         WOMAN 2
               You're having a boy.
     
                         WOMAN 1
               So?
     
         Viktor blanches.  It is not the reaction he'd hoped for.
     
     C)  Inside a theater, VIKTOR hovers by the door, smirking.
     
         ON SCREEN, we hear a farmyard scene -- SIMONE in an empty
         farmyard on all fours, grunting like a pig, and foraging
         for muddy vegetables.
     
         The AUDIENCE is shocked, then suddenly breaks into
         spontaneous applause.
     
         Viktor, enraged, exits into the lobby past the poster for
         "I AM PIG - Starring Simone".
     
     D)  A pretentious FILM CRITIC talks to camera, a film poster
         behind him.
     
                         FILM CRITIC
               For Simone to do something as brave
               as "I AM PIG" at this point in her
               career, with so much to lose -- all
               I can say is, "I Am Pig, I Am
               Oscar".
     
     E)  In his soundstage, VIKTOR moves a slider that adds
         wrinkles to Simone.
     
     F)  SIMONE appears on a morning talk show -- as usual, remote
         on a TV screen.  However, her squeaky-clean image has
         gone -- hair unkempt, bloated, chain-smoking and drinking
         during the interview.  The HOSTS are smiling weakly.
     
                         HOST
               Simone, that's a rather
               controversial position.
     
                         SIMONE
               I just think all elementary schools
               should have a firing range -- so
               students can learn how to defend
               themselves.  We could fit it
               inbetween recess and American
               History.
     
     Another clip:
     
                         SIMONE
               If there's a hole in the ozone
               layer why can't I see it?
     
     Another clip:
     
                         SIMONE
               Immigration?!  God, isn't it
               crowded enough?!
     
                         HOSTS
               Just as we always knew.  Simone's
               not like other celebrities.  She
               speaks her mind!
     
     G)  VIKTOR driving along a city street, suddenly slams on his
         brakes, almost causing an accident.  He stares numbly up
         at a twenty-foot high smiling photo of Simone on a
         billboard featuring a huge cover of TIME MAGAZINE.  It
         reads, "SIMONE: WOMAN OF THE YEAR".
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (to himself)
               She's trying to kill me.
     
     Realizing what he's said, a thought comes into his eyes.
     
     EXT.  CEMETERY - DAY
     
     An inscription on a headstone reads:
     
                              HANK ALENO
                     Remembered Virtually Forever
     
     VIKTOR kneels at HANK's grave.  He places a bunch of flowers
     there.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (referring to the flowers)
               They're plastic, Hank.  I know
               that's the way you'd want it.
                   (glancing to a Simone
                    billboard outside the
                    cemetery wall)
               She killed you, Hank.  Now she's
               killing me.  She's a serial killer.
                   (ducking out of sight of
                    the billboard as if
                    Simone is watching him)
               But I don't know how to stop her. 
               She's taken on a life of her own. 
               I can't just come clean -- make
               some confession.  I've defrauded
               millions -- they'd turn on me.  And
               I can't put the genie back in the
               bottle.  If she stopped working --
               dropped out of sight, they'd never
               let it rest.  I've tried to kill
               her career but they like her even
               more.
                   (more desperate)
               What am I going to do, Hank?
     
     A thought occurs to Viktor.  He slowly rises from behind
     Hank's headstone, revealing a forest of headstones.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Don't say another word, Hank.  You
               are truly a genius.
     
     INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DUSK
     
     A sad but resolute VIKTOR sits in front of his monitor,
     SIMONE's face full screen.
     
     He speaks into the voice synthesizer, Simone's face
     automatically speaking the words he speaks -- the final time
     he puts his words in her mouth.
     
                         SIMONE / VIKTOR
               What's the matter, Viktor?  You
               look so sad.  Don't you love me
               anymore?... It's over, isn't it?
     
     He switches off the synthesizer and speaks in his own voice.
     
                         VIKTOR
               It's the only way, Simone.  If it's
               any consolation, you're going to
               live on in the public's heart like
               all the other tragic figures that
               went before their time.  There's no
               love like posthumous love.
     
     On the screen, Simone is on the verge of tears.
     
                         VIKTOR
               I know what you're thinking.  It's
               a phoney-baloney world.  The women
               are surgically enhanced, the
               athletes are on steroids, the
               singers are lip-syncing if they're
               even singing at all, the news is
               entertainment, the politicians are
               bought and paid for -- we're living
               one big lie.  So why shouldn't you
               live too?  You're more authentic
               than the people who adore you.
                   (a trace of despair)
               And that's the problem.  You're
               looking at the real fraud.  I told
               myself this was all about the work
               but if that was the truth, it
               wouldn't matter to me -- and it
               does.  It wasn't that the artists
               had no respect for the art.  They
               had no respect for me.  Someone
               like you, you have so much love
               showered on you -- I just wanted to
               feel one tiny drop on my face.  I'm
               sorry, Simone.  Here I've been
               trying to convince the world that
               you exist, but I was really trying
               to convince them that I exist. 
               It's not that you aren't human,
               Simone, it's that I am.
     
     Viktor produces a disc from his jacket marked, "PLAGUE - Ver.
     8.1".  He places the disc in the machine.
     
     Viktor sees that Simone is crying.  He touches a tear on his
     own face and realizes her tears are in response to his own.
     
     Viktor hesitates -- a moment of doubt -- then presses
     "ENTER".  The image of SIMONE's face gradually begins to
     deconstruct -- pixel by pixel -- as the virus takes hold. 
     The pixels collect into a pile at the bottom of his screen
     like dust.  Finally, the dust is blown away in a single
     digital breath.
     
     For a moment his attention is taken with a layer of dust on
     his own desk.
     
     Viktor regards his own reflection in the now black screen. 
     His hard-drive now corrupted, he picks up his original disc
     marked, "SIMULATION ONE".
     
     He tosses this disc into a steamer trunk he has loaded with
     hundreds of discs relating to Simone's software.  He shuts
     the lid and begins dragging the trunk towards the door.
     
     EXT.  SANTA MONICA BAY - DUSK
     
     Viktor's yacht sits at anchor in the glassy waters of Santa
     Monica Bay -- "SIMONE" written on the stern.
     
     VIKTOR manhandles the trunk to the railing.  A mournful pause
     -- then he heaves it over the side.  The trunk sinks like a
     stone.
     
     Heart heavy, Viktor stares into the inky depths.
     
     EXT.  STUDIO - ENTRANCE - DAY
     
     A throng of REPORTERS and CAMERA CREWS.  A somber VIKTOR
     enters and takes a seat in front of a forest of microphones.
     
                         VIKTOR
               It is my sad and solemn duty to
               announce the tragic passing of
               Simone.
     
     A gasp from the audience.  Then, an explosion of anguish.
     
                         CROWD
               No!!  What happened?!  Oh.  God.

                   (stepping forward,
                    mustering the courage to
                    ask the question)
               How did she die?
     
                         VIKTOR
               A rare virus.
                   (pretending to compose
                    himself)
               On her goodwill tour of the third
               world.
     
                         PRESS REPORTER 2
               Did she suffer?
     
                         VIKTOR
               Mercifully, it was quick.
     
     At the back of the room are MAX SAYER and MILTON.  They are
     frozen in grief, a tear spills from Max's eye.
     
     A MONTAGE OF SCENES:
     
     A)  "SIMON GONE - FADE TO BLACK", reads the cover of Variety.
     
     B)  The announcement of her death appears on local TV news
         shows around the globe.
     
     C)  A carpet of bouquets and notes of commiseration several
         yards wide completely surrounds Viktor's property
         including the driveway.  VIKTOR insensitively drives over
         the bouquets to the horror of the MOURNERS, including MAX
         SAYER and MILTON.
     
     D)  In a remote Mongolian encampment MONGOL HORSEMEN crowd
         around a television showing a live picture of Simone's
         funeral.
     
     E)  The HEARSE carrying Simone's "body" and the funeral
         procession led solemnly by VIKTOR, proceeds through the
         studio lot.  Distraught STUDIO STAFF toss flowers onto
         the hearse.
     
     F)  The same television picture is playing on a television
         sitting on a stool in a WEST AFRICAN river.  LOCAL WOMEN
         stop washing their clothes to watch.
     
     EXT.  GRAVESIDE - CEMETERY - DAY
     
     We tilt up from Hank's headstone to an ornate mausoleum on an
     island in a lake.
     
     Simone's coffin is ferried across a bridge by PALLBEARERS
     from the studio.  Numerous MOURNERS follow behind.
     
     VIKTOR, ELAINE and a curiously dry-eyed LAINEY walk behind
     the coffin.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (to Elaine)
               Can I see you later -- go away for
               the weekend?
     
                         ELAINE
                   (horrified by the
                    suggestion)
               How can you bring that up at a time
               like this?
     
     The coffin reaches the steps of the marble mausoleum.  A
     PRIEST, RABBI, and a BUDDHIST MONK turn to Viktor.  He nods
     and they start to carry the coffin towards the door. 
     However, the coffin is suddenly stopped by a POLICE OFFICER.
     
     A SECOND POLICE OFFICER begins to jimmy open the lid.  The
     coffin lid is pulled back.  Inside is a life-sized cardboard
     standee of Simone from "ETERNITY FOREVER".
     
     The MOURNERS gasp.  Everyone looks to Viktor.
     
     INT.  L.A. COUNTY JAIL - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY
     
     A SERIES OF POLICE INTERVIEWS:
     
     JANE sits in the interview room, describing Viktor's assault
     on the standee.
     
                         JANE
               -- I heard him say, "Die bitch".
     
     A)  MAX SAYER, distraught and weeping.
     
                         MAX
               -- He was a controlling madman, she
               was a prisoner.  I blame myself...
               I should have done more to stop
               it...
     
     B)  NICOLA gives a statement.
     
                         NICOLA
               -- It was strange.  He wanted to
               replace her with me in his new
               movie... and I know I'm not that
               good.
     
     INT.  L.A. COUNTY JAIL - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
     
     VIKTOR sits in an interrogation room in a sea of SIMONE. 
     Magazine covers, cosmetics advertisements, publicity shots,
     interviews, website print-outs, photographs and report cards
     from her fictitious childhood are plastered on the walls,
     stacks of film cans and tapes of her numerous movie and
     television appearances.
     
                         DETECTIVE
               -- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm
               just trying to understand.  All
               these films, TV appearances,
               magazine covers, internet
               interviews, publicity photos,
               snapshots from her childhood -- all
               fake.
                   (referring to various
                    items)
               This is fake, this is fake -- fake,
               fake, fake, all fake.
     
                         VIKTOR
               That's right.  You understand
               perfectly.  I will confess to
               fraud, not murder.
     
                         DETECTIVE
                   (referring to oversize
                    mail bags)
               A fan club with a worldwide
               membership in the millions -- also
               bogus?
     
                         VIKTOR
               Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But
               they were worshipping computer code
               -- ones and zeros.
     
                         DETECTIVE
               So, of course, you couldn't kill
               Simone because there never was a
               Simone.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Of course.
     
                         DETECTIVE
               And this Mr. Hank Aleno who you
               talk so much about, a renowned
               failure, who also happens to be so
               conveniently dead -- perhaps the
               "man" you claim helped invent
               Simone is an invention himself?
     
     Viktor, sensing his sarcasm, does not reply.
     
                         DETECTIVE
                   (patronizing smile)
               But not everyone's imaginary, are
               they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of
               course, to Edith.
     
                         VIKTOR
               Who?
     
     The Detective raises a window-blind to reveal a next door
     room where the OLD WOMAN from the rest home is being
     interviewed.
     
                         DETECTIVE
               The woman you admitted to a
               journalist is Simone's mother and
               for whose silence you paid a
               fortune?  Is she not flesh to you --
               are her tears not wet?
     
     The OLD WOMAN glances up and sees all the photos of Simone
     through the window.
     
                         OLD LADY
               My BABY!
     
     The Detective abruptly lowers the blind.  Viktor rolls his
     eyes at the Detective's theatrics.  He is suddenly enraged.
     
                         VIKTOR
               She's insane!  This whole thing is
               insane!  There is no Simone.  Look!
                   (grabbing a Simone poster)
               Even her name is fake.  It's not
               Simone.
                   (he tears Simone's name in
                    half to demonstrate)
               It's SIM... ONE!  Simulation One!
     
     The Detectives sadly shake their heads.
     
                         DETECTIVE 2
                   (regarding Simone's face
                    also torn in half)
               You really hated her, didn't you?
     
     The Detective places a tape, marked "EXHIBIT A" in a video
     machine.
     
                         DETECTIVE
               Perhaps you could explain this to
               me, Mr. Taransky -- or is this tape
               "doctored" too?
     
     He plays a tape showing --
     
     EXT.  MARINA PIER - NIGHT (ON TV SCREEN)
     
     VIKTOR dragging his trunk from his car down the pier to his
     yacht.
     
                         DETECTIVE
               It's footage from the marina's
               closed-circuit camera on the night
               in question.  Altered, of course. 
               Is that really what you expect us
               to believe, Mr. Taransky?
     
     The Detective freezes the tape.
     
                         DETECTIVE
               Can you tell us why you were
               disposing of the body of a woman
               who didn't exist?
     
                         VIKTOR
               It wasn't her body.  It was her
               body of work.
     
                         DETECTIVE
               Why don't you just come clean,
               Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll
               feel better afterwards.
     
                         VIKTOR
               I am telling the truth.
     
                         DETECTIVE
                   (coming close to him)
               We all know what happened.  In a
               fit of jealous rage you killed
               Simone and dumped her body off a
               boat she bought for you.
     
                         VIKTOR
               No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll
               take you to her.
     
     EXT.  BOAT - SANTA MONICA BAY - DAY
     
     VIKTOR sits handcuffed on a POLICE BOAT with the DETECTIVE
     and his LAWYER.  DIVERS surface with the steamer trunk. 
     Viktor's face lights up.
     
     The trunk is winched aboard.  However, as it lowers onto the
     deck, we see the latch has broken and the lid is ajar.  All
     eyes stare inside the trunk as the lid is lifted.  Apart from
     a scrawny piece of kelp -- empty.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (panicky, desperately
                    grabbing the divers)
               Did you find anything else --
               drivers, discs... disc-drives?
     
                         DIVER 1
               Nothing.
                   (gazing to the water)
               We couldn't stay down any longer.
     
     All eyes follow the diver's gaze to several SHARK FINS in the
     water.
     
     CLOSE UP ON FRONT PAGE OF L.A. TIMES:
     
                "SIMONE"S BODY FEARED EATEN BY SHARKS"
     
     The newspaper is being read by Viktor's LAWYER, sitting
     opposite Viktor in his cell.  VIKTOR is numb -- the
     likelihood of conviction slowly dawning on him.
     
                         LAWYER
               -- Plead guilty and throw yourself
               on the mercy of the court.  It's
               the best deal you're going to get.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (incredulous)
               I could get the death penalty.
     
                         LAWYER
               You certainly will if you go to
               trial -- a jury in this kind of
               ugly mood.  You've killed an icon,
               for God's sake.
     
                         VIKTOR
               I didn't kill anyone, Bernard,
               there was no one to kill!
     
                         LAWYER
                   (musing)
               An insanity defence.
     
     INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
     
     A FIGURE sits at Viktor's computer.  LAINEY.  She scrolls
     through Viktor's files.  All empty.
     
     Lainey sighs.  ELAINE paces behind her.
     
                         ELAINE
               Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing
               here.
     
                         LAINEY
               Just a minute.
     
     Elaine continues to pace as Lainey works.
     
                         ELAINE
               God, it's so like your father.  Why
               can't people take responsibility
               for their actions anymore?  I can
               almost forgive him for killing
               Simone -- but denying her
               existence.  I can never forgive
               that.
     
                         LAINEY
               Because obviously she existed,
               right?
     
                         ELAINE
               I know it as surely as you're
               sitting here, sweetheart.  She was
               the most vital woman I ever met.
     
                         LAINEY
               So you did meet her?
     
                         ELAINE
               Of course.  What are you
               suggesting?
     
                         LAINEY
               I mean really meet her -- in the
               flesh.
     
     Elaine regards her daughter curiously.
     
                         LAINEY
               I know it's embarrassing to admit
               it, mom, but when I think about it 
               -- honestly, I haven't.  I mean, it
               feels like I have.  I know more
               about her than members of my own
               family.  She's even in my dreams. 
               But I realized, going back through
               my diary, they were all TV
               appearances, near misses at
               parties, second-hand rumor, gossip
               on the internet.  I've never
               actually seen Simone up close,
               touched her, been in her physical
               presence.  Have you?
     
                         ELAINE
                   (unable to refute it)
               Well, I --
     
                         LAINEY
               -- We don't believe daddy because
               we don't want to believe we were
               taken in too.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (trying to shake the
                    notion from her head)
               Lainey, there's no evidence that
               Simone isn't real.
     
                         LAINEY
               Listen to what you're saying, mom. 
               Is there any evidence she is?
     
     Lainey finally tries another file.  She presses "EJECT".  The
     "PLAGUE" disc spits out of the machine.
     
                         LAINEY
                   (regarding the disc)
               There's one part of dad's story
               that may have been true.  Simone
               may have contracted a virus.
     
     Lainey smiles at her mother.
     
                         LAINEY
               Certain viruses can be cured.
     
     INT.  L.A. COUNTY JAIL - POLICE CELL - DAY
     
     VIKTOR sits in his cell, arms crossed, quietly seething,
     while his LAWYER lays out his trial strategy.
     
                         LAWYER
                   (hushed tones, referring
                    to a thick Psychiatric
                    Report)
               ... Listen, I've found a
               psychiatrist in Ventura -- well
               respected -- who's willing to
               testify under oath that you have
               diminished capacity due to the
               trauma of your divorce, ten years
               of abject failure in the movie
               business and a bump on the head you
               sustained as a child --
     
     VIKTOR, fuming throughout this, suddenly explodes.
     
                         VIKTOR
               -- No!  I can't go along with this
               horseshit!  Just tell them they can
               fry me!
     
                         LAWYER
                   (aghast, looking around to
                    see if anyone has heard)
               What?!
     
                         VIKTOR
               It was premeditated -- I knew
               exactly what I was doing!  I
               strangled her!  I bludgeoned her! 
               I set her on fire!  I did it!  I
               killed her!
     
                         DETECTIVE (O.S.)
                   (clearing his throat)
               Excuse me.
     
     The Lawyer spins around guiltily.  The Detective stands
     outside the cell, clearly overhearing the confession. 
     Viktor, resigned to his fate, couldn't care less.
     
                         DETECTIVE
               I think you'd better see this.
     
     The Detective switches on the TV set hanging outside the
     cell.  VBC is playing -- "BREAKING NEWS" --
     
     INT.  TELEVISION STUDIO - "VBC" - DAY (ON TV SCREEN)
     
     A NEWS ANCHOR appears.
     
                         VBC ANCHOR
                   (from TV)
               -- Breaking news -- international
               media star, Simone, is alive and
               well.  Her studio released this
               footage only minutes ago...
     
     EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY (ON TV SCREEN)
     
     The brief clip shows the front page of the L.A. Times --
     headlines: "HOLLYWOOD SUSPENDS FILMING IN MEMORY OF SIMONE"
     and "D.A. Seeks Death Penalty for Taransky".
     
     The reader lowers the newspaper to reveal herself -- SIMONE,
     on the studio lot, looking more beautiful than ever.  She
     winks to the camera.
     
                         VBC ANCHOR
               ... Simone reading today's edition
               of the L.A. Times.  Who says, "The
               only bad publicity is your
               obituary"?  Details at the top of
               the hour.
     
     The TV is switched off.  Viktor stares at the screen, trying
     to take it in.
     
                         VIKTOR
               You're indestructible.
     
     When he looks back to the Detective, he discovers him holding
     the cell door open.
     
                         DETECTIVE
                   (shaking his head in pity)
               I'll never get you Hollywood
               people.
     
     EXT.  L.A. COUNTY JAIL - DAY
     
     A throng of REPORTERS, PAPARAZZI and ONLOOKERS parts like a
     sea for VIKTOR, released from custody.  One placard reads,
     "ASK JESUS TO SAVE YOU NOW".  He is escorted to a waiting
     limousine where he is met by ELAINE and LAINEY.  He hugs them
     both.
     
     INT.  LIMOUSINE - DAY
     
     VIKTOR sits beside ELAINE.  LAINEY sits opposite, studying
     her laptop computer.  Outside the car, REPORTERS are pressed
     against the glass.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (relaxing back into his
                    seat)
               Thank you!
                   (to Lainey)
               I don't know how you did it but
               thank you.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (putting her arm around
                    him)
               Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. 
               You know what we have to do?
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (resigned smile)
               Why stop at one character when you
               can have a whole cast?
     
                         ELAINE
               Exactly.  Now that you have the
               studio behind you, we can really do
               things.
     
     Viktor shrugs resignedly, savoring his freedom.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (holding Viktor close)
               I was thinking -- what about you
               and... "Simone" moving back in with
               me and Lainey?
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (meeting her gaze)
               That sounds wonderful.
                   (to Lainey)
               How do you feel about all this,
               Lainey?
     
                         LAINEY
                   (beaming)
               About you and mom?
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (reluctant admission)
               Me and Simone.  What I did.
     
                         LAINEY
                   (sweet smile)
               Your mistake wasn't making
               something fake, daddy.  We're fine
               with fake -- as long as you don't
               lie about it.
     
     Once again his daughter's words have a ghastly ring of truth. 
     Viktor stares out of the limo window as the car gradually
     forces its way through the reporters.
     
     He recognizes MAX and MILTON amongst the mob.  Max has
     hastily scribbled a note that he presses against the
     window --
     
     "WILL PAY $ FOR EXCLUSIVE".  Viktor looks away.
     
                         ELAINE
                   (kissing him on the cheek)
               Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's
               not a death sentence.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (still staring out of the
                    window, a rueful smile)
               No... it's life.
     
     INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - DAY
     
     FRANK BRAND conducts a remote interview with SIMONE who
     appears as usual on a television monitor.
     
                         FRANK BRAND
               -- Simone, the question on
               everyone's mind is simply... "why?"
     
                         SIMONE
               Frank, you know as well as I do,
               living in a fish bowl, the
               insatiable appetite of the media...
     
     Frank nods sympathetically.
     
                         SIMONE
               With everything that was going on
               in my life, I just needed to drop
               out of sight for a while -- I
               needed time.  Viktor bought me that
               time.  I owe him so much.
     
                         FRANK BRAND
               We all do.
                   (quickly returning to
                    Simone)
               But now I understand you're eager
               to get back to work -- and not the
               kind of work that we're all
               expecting.
     
                         SIMONE
                   (smiles coyly)
               That's true.  I can reveal that I
               am considering a career in
               politics.
     
                         FRANK BRAND
               And what may I ask brought this on?
     
     SIMONE holds up a beautiful BABY BOY to camera.
     
                         SIMONE
               I suppose this little man had
               something to do with it.  Viktor
               and I are both concerned about what
               kind of world our new son, Chip, is
               going to grow up in.
                   (turning lovingly to
                    Viktor)
               Aren't you, Viktor?
     
     On Frank Brand's monitor, the camera pulls back to reveal
     VIKTOR, sitting on a sofa -- an idyllic domestic scene.
     
                         VIKTOR
                   (turning lovingly to
                    Simone)
               Yes.
     
     INT.  SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
     
     Only we see the set where the interview is being recorded. 
     VIKTOR is sitting on a sofa against a green screen in his
     soundstage, smiling at a woman and child who are not there --
     he is alone.
     
     CUT TO BLACK
     
     INT.  CONCERT STADIUM - NIGHT
     
     DURING THE CLOSING CREDITS SIMONE PERFORMS ANOTHER SONG FROM
     HER CONCERT TOUR -- "(YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE) A NATURAL
     WOMAN".
