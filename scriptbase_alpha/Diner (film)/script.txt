          The SCREEN IS BLACK. We hear MUFFLED ROCK and ROLL
          MUSIC. Then we read:

                         BALTIMORE

                         1959

          FADE OUT.

          INT. DANCE HALL BASEMENT - NIGHT

          FENWICK walks along the dimly lit basement. Heavy wiatei
          coats hang from hooks on the wall. In the b.g., there
          is constant traffic of pecple coming and going from the
          rest rooms. From above we hear the MUFFLED SOtJV OF THE

          ROCK AND ROLL BAND.
          Fenwick is in his early 20s and dressed in the "JOE
          COLLEGE." style of the late fifties. Sports jacket, button-
          down shirt, chino pants, and Bass weejuns. We sense
          that he is a little lost in himself, confused. He looks
          out one of the windows that views the parking lot. Then
          without any outward anger, he punches his fist through a
          window pane. Seconds later he breaks another window with
          his fist.

          Fenwick, picking up the music beat from above, struts to
          the sound as he approaches another bank of windows. He
          calmly breaks another window pane with. his fist.
          A GUY coming out of the bathroom in the b.g . sees Fenwick's
          actions and then heads up the steps.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. DANCE HALL - NIGHT

          The crowd is gathered around the bandstand listening to
          the local group, the SH K RS, playing their popular hit
          HOT NUTS. The song is played toward the end of the even-
          ing because of its risque Lyrics.

                         BAND LEADER
          Hot nuts, hot nuts, get from
          the peanut man.


           BAND LEADER (CONT' D)

           Hot nuts hot nuts, get em any -
          way you can.

          As the crowd swings the verse back to the Band Leader.
          The Guy who spotted Fenwick breaking windows approaches
          BOOGIE. Boogie is something of a "Dandy," flashiar
          in dress than others in his crowd. Although he isn't
          particularly good looking there is something about his
          attitude that is very appealing to girls. Boogie
          aster hearing the Guy heads downstairs.

          INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
          Fenwick casually breaks another window with his fist.
          His hand is bleeding. Boogie approaches.

                         BOOGIE
          What's up, Fen?

                         FENWICK
          Just breaking windows, Boog

          BOOGIE. -
          What for?

          It's a smile.
          He breaks another window with his fist.

                         BOOGIE
          C' mon, don't be a sWuck.

          FENWICK
          I know that glass is made from
          sand, but how come you can see
          through it?

          He breaks another window. Boogie grabs him.

                         BOOGIE
          Leave the windows alone. What's
          the matter with you?

                         FENWICX
          It's a smile, that's all.

                         BOOGIE
          I'm cracking up.

          FENWICK
          Gave her away.

                         BOOGIE
          What?

                         FENWICK
          Gave her away. David Glazer said
          she was death.. So, I said if you

          FENWICK

          Elyse's mother is very upset with
          Eddie. They picked out a yellow
          and white motif for the wedding.
          You know, like we did, tablecloth,
          napkins, maids-,of-honor. Anyway,
          Eddie objected. He wanted blue and
          white because that's The Colts'
          colors. Refused to give in.

          Had her for Art class. Third floor.
          She catches mq talking. Tells me
          to see her after class. I jumped
          up from my seat and started
          screaming 'I can't take it - any
          morei You're always picking on met
          I can't stand itt' Then, I ran to
          the window, opened it and jumped
          out. She freaks and faints dead
          away. She forgot the gym roof was
          six feet below.

          The topper was the Principal.
          Donley comes in and sees Miss
          Nathan on the floor. He doesn't
          I .ow what to make of it.

          I said, 'I'm sorry I'm late, sir,
          but my bus broke dour.. Is Miss
          Nathan up yet?'
          All the guys laugh.

          Boogie squirs around ever-,so-slightly and then places
          the box of popcorn back on his lap. Evidently he has
          stuck his penis into the bottom of the popcorn box. Fen-

          Eddie smiles.
          Carol's hand dips into the popcorn box on Boogie's lap and
          takes out a handful of popcorn.
          Shrevie, seated in the back, is restless, wondering what

          Carol's hand again reaches into the box and takes out a
          few kernels. Boogie's eyes glance toward Fenwick. Fenwick
          shakes his. head and mouths "Bet's off. Not fair." Boogie
          nods "Yes.

          she screaws. She bolts up from her seat and races up the
          aisle. The audience iq alive with chatter, war, wondering what
          has happened.
          Boogie turns to Fenwick and smiles. Then he heads ue the
          aisle after Carol.

          The MUSIC BEGINS. However, it is not the traditional
          wedding math but rather the Baltimore Colts'Fight Song.
          Even though the organist has softened it, there is still
          _a _"rah-rah" quality to it. The flower girl comes down the---

          by that as well. I've always held
          -.back with you.- When we kissed, I
          held back. The same when we made
