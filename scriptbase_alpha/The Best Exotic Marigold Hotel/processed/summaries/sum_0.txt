Seven elderly Britons, for a variety of reasons, respond to an online ad and travel to Jaipur, India, where they find run-down hotel with a young, exuberant, and optimistic host.
Evelyn, newly widowed, wants low-cost experience, Graham seeks a long-ago love, Douglas and Jean have lost their pension in a family investment, Muriel needs cheap hip surgery, Madge seeks a rich husband, and Norman is chasing women.
India affects each in different ways, enchanting Douglas and Evelyn while driving Jean deeper into bitterness.
Their host, young Sonny, has dreams but little cash or skill; he also has a girlfriend whom his mother dismisses.
Stories cross and discoveries await each one.
