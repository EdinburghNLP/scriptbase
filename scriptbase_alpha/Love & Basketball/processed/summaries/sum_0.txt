In 1981 in L.A., Monica moves in next door to Quincy.
They're 11, and both want to play in the NBA, just like Quincy's dad.
Their love-hate relationship lasts into high school, with Monica's edge and Quincy's top-dog attitude separating them, except when Quincy's parents argue and he climbs through Monica's window to sleep on the floor.
As high school ends, they come together as a couple, but within a year, with both of them playing ball at USC, Quincy's relationship with his father takes an ugly turn, and it leads to a break up with Monica.
Some years later, their pro careers at a crossroads, they meet again.
It's time for a final game of one-on-one with high stakes.
