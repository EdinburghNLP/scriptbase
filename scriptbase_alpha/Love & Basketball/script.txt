LOVE AND BASKETBALL

BY

GINA PRINCE-BYTHEWOOD



































     OPENING TITLES

     SLOW MOTION.  STYLIZED.  TIGHT.

     The silhouette of a man and woman.  They are on a blacktop
     basketball court, playing a sexually-charged game of one-one-
     one.

     Sweat glistens.  Hands pull at clothes.  Hips bump and
     collide.  Eyes lock...

                                        FADE TO:

     BLACK.

     FADE IN:

     TITLE CARD: "FIRST QUARTER" then "1981"

     BALDWIN HILLS

     EXT. MCCALL HOUSE - LATE MORNING

     An upper middle-class neighborhood, known as the Black
     Beverly Hills.  Big houses, green grass and Caddies in every
     other driveway.  The street is quiet, until --

                    YOUNG VOICE (O.S.)
          You wanna be Kareem?

     CAMERA REVEALS: QUINCY MCCALL, eleven years old, dribbling a
     basketball in front of KELVIN and JAMAL, also eleven.  He
     sports a fro, a "Clippers" jersey, and a serious swagger.

                    QUINCY (CONT'D)
          All his big butt do is stand by the
          basket.

                    JAMAL
          Shoot, I'll be blocking your stuff.

                    KELVIN
          I'm gonna be like Dr. J.

                    QUINCY
          I'ma be like my Dad.

                    JAMAL
          He ain't a star or nothing.

                    QUINCY
          I don't see none of your sorry daddies in
          the NBA.

                    KELVIN
          Hey, look, Q.

     Quincy follows Kelvin's eyes, to a beat-up pair of Converse
     All-Stars approaching from next door.  Walking in the kicks
     is a YOUNG KID in a T-shirt and Tuff-skins, and a LAKERS cap
     pulled low.  A moving van is parked in the driveway.

                    KELVIN (cont'd)
          Thought only girls were moving in.

                    QUINCY
          That's what my Moms said.

                    KELVIN
          I hope he can ball.

                    JAMAL
          Bet he's a scrub.

     The Kid stops at the edge of Quincy's driveway.

                    KID
          Hey.

                    QUINCY
          Hey.

                    KID
          Can I play?

                    QUINCY
          You nice?

                    KID
          Yeah, I'm nice.

     Quincy looks the Kid up and down, then --

                    QUINCY
          You and Kelvin gainst me and Jamal.

     Quincy tosses the Kid the ball.  The Kid pulls off the
     baseball cap.  Brown hair tumbles down, framing a soft brown
     face and bright eyes.  She is MONICA WRIGHT, eleven years
     old.

                    JAMAL
          Ah man, he is a girl.

                    QUINCY
          Girls can't play no ball.

                    MONICA
          Ball better than you.

     Quincy laughs derisively as Monica walks to the top of the
     driveway.

                    QUINCY
               (whispering)
          What a dog.

     Monica shoots him a glare.

                    JAMAL
          She heard you.

                    QUINCY
          Nuh uh, they could only hear dog
          whistles.

     Monica starts to dribble.  Jamal whistles as he walks
     backwards, guarding her.  She throws up a shot.  IT'S AN
     AIRBALL.  Quincy and Jamal crack up.  Kelvin rolls his eyes.

     Quincy grabs the rebound and shoots.  Swish.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          One, zip.

     He rolls the ball to Monica.  She starts dribbling and again,
     Jamal just backs up with her.  She passes to Kelvin.  Jamal
     and Quincy collapse on him, leaving Monica open under the
     basket.  Trapped Kelvin has no choice but to pass it back.

     Monica catches the ball and throws up a shot.  It banks off
     the backboard...AND DROPS THROUGH THE NET.  The boys look at
     her in shock.  Monica tosses the ball back to Quincy.

                    MONICA
          One, up.

                    QUINCY
          Lucky.

     Quincy easily dribbles by Kelvin and lays up the ball.  He
     throws the ball back to Monica.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          Two, one.

     Monica dribbles.  Jamal plays her a little tighter.  Monica
     bounces the ball through his open legs and lays up the ball.

                    MONICA
          Two, up.

     Quincy can't believe it.  Kelvin cracks up.

                    KELVIN
          Aaah, she dogged you.

                    JAMAL
          Shut up.

     The game continues, with Quincy and Monica trading baskets
     for their teams.  Quincy grows agitated with Jamal, who is
     unable to stop her.  The score hits nine, nine.

     Quincy stands at the top of the driveway, ball in hand.

                    QUINCY
          Point.

     Quincy dribbles through his legs, then pops an outside shot.
     The ball bounces on the rim...and rolls off.

     Quincy curses as Monica grabs the rebound and clears the
     ball.  Jamal moves to guard her, but Quincy shoves him off.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          I got her.

     Quincy defends.  Monica smiles back at him.

                    MONICA
          Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be
          the first girl in the NBA.

                    QUINCY
          I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my
          cheerleader.

     Monica suddenly passes to Kelvin, sprints for the basket.
     Quincy stumbles, giving her a step.  Kelvin throws it back.

     Quincy knows he's beat as Monica goes for the winning lay-up.
     In desperation, he swings at her for the hard foul, shoving
     her off balance.

     THE BALL FLIES FROM HER HAND AS SHE CRASHES TO THE GROUND,
     FACE-FIRST.  SHE GRABS HER CHEEK.  BLOOD SLIPS THROUGH HER
     FINGERS.

     The boys stand frozen.  Quincy stares down at her, his eyes
     wide with fear...and regret.

     INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - BATHROOM - LATE MORNING

     Monica leans over the sink as her mother, CAMILLE, 36, wipes
     the blood from her face with a washcloth.

                    GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Eeew.

     Her sister, LENA, 14, leans in the doorway, making a face.
     She is a mirror of their mother, with relaxed hair and
     painted nails.

     Her father, NATHAN, 39, moves behind Lena, holding a box.

                    NATHAN
          How are you feeling, munchkin?

     Monica nods.  He smiles.

                    NATHAN (cont'd)
          Yeah, you're through.

                    CAMILLE
          She needs to stop running around like a
          little boy.

                    NATHAN
          She's alright.

                    CAMILLE
          How is she alright looking the way she
          does?

                    NATHAN
          Camille, she'll be fine.

     He gives Monica a wink, crosses away.  Monica pulls the
     washcloth away from her Mom and starts wiping the blood
     herself.

                    CAMILLE
          I'll get some ice.

     She exits.  Lena shakes her head, follows.

     Monica pulls the washcloth from her face and stares into the
     mirror.  TORN SKIN SURROUNDS A SMALL DEEP GASH IN HER CHEEK.
     Seeing her latest battle scar, there's only one thing left
     for this little girl to do.  She smiles.

     INT. MCCALL HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

     Quincy sits at the kitchen table, writing "I AM SORRY" in
     block letters across a homemade card.  His face is tight with
     concentration as he tries to write in a straight line.

     At the counter, his mom, NONA, moves a cake from its store
     box to a cake dish.  She is 30, beautiful, with effort.  She
     smooths the frosting with a spoon.

     ZEKE, 32, with the height and ego of an NBA ballplayer,
     enters.  He laughs.

                    ZEKE
          Girl, who you trying to fool?

     Quincy looks up, smiles.  He quickly grabs a piece of
     crumpled paper, and tosses it to Zeke.

                    QUINCY
          Alley-oop, Dad.

     Nona intercepts his pass.

                    NONA
          Boy...

     She points him back to his card.  Quincy scowls, starts
     writing again.  Nona scoops some frosting on her finger,
     holds it up.

                    NONA (cont'd)
          New neighbors.

     Zeke wraps his lips around her finger, sucks the frosting
     off.

                    ZEKE
          See, Quincy, this is how your Moms caught
          me, with the old fake and bake.  Had me
          thinking I was getting a sister who could
          burn.

     Nona laughs, pulls him down for a kiss.  Quincy suddenly
     throws down his pencil in frustration.

                    QUINCY
          I can't do this shit.

     Zeke and Nona pull away, stare at Quincy in shock.

                    ZEKE
          Boy, what'd I tell you about using that
          word?

                    QUINCY
               (sighs, then)
          "Can't" should never be in a man's
          vocabulary.

                    ZEKE
          Why not?

                    QUINCY
          Cause when you say can't, you ain't a
          man.

                    ZEKE
          That's right.

                    NONA
          Zeke.

                    ZEKE
          What?
               (then)
          Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."

     Nona just shakes her head.

                    NONA
          We should head over.

                    ZEKE
          Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a
          meeting.

                    NONA
          With who?

                    ZEKE
          Business folks.

                    NONA
          You just got back from a four game road
          trip.

                    ZEKE
          Nona, don't start bitching.  I got maybe
          two years left to play.  I'm just trying
          to put some things together for us.

     Zeke grabs his keys.

                    ZEKE (cont'd)
          Later, Quincy.

                    QUINCY
          Later, Dad.

     Zeke exits.  Nona leans against the counter, concerned.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          Mom?

                    NONA
          What?

                    QUINCY
          We still have to go?

                    NONA
               (beat)
          Yeah.

       INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY



     Camille and Nona stand among the piles of boxes.  Monica and
     Quincy stand at their mothers' sides, stealing glances at
     each other.  A large bandage covers Monica's cheek.  Monica
     holds her card, Camille holds the cake.

                    NONA
          ...we moved back here when Quincy was
          about five, after Zeke was traded.
          Neighborhood was a little more mixed
          back then...

                    CAMILLE
          Until the Black family down the street
          became the Black family next door.

                    NONA
               (nods)
          Okay?

     Camille tries to smooth down Monica's unruly hair.  Monica
     moves her head.

                    CAMILLE
          Well, thanks again.  This was really nice
          of you.

                    NONA
          It was the least we could do.  And I love
          to cook.

     Quincy looks up at his Mom, surprised.  She quickly hugs his
     face into her stomach.  Camille lights up.

                    CAMILLE
          Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my
          friends' parties and things back in
          Atlanta.

                    NONA
          You're a caterer?

                    CAMILLE
          Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled
          and the girls get a little older, it's
          definitely something I want to do.
               (then)
          Since you love to cook, maybe it's
          something we can talk about.

     Quincy snickers.  Nona quickly changes the subject.

                    NONA
          You know, girl, long as I've lived next
          door, I've never seen the inside of this
          house.

                    CAMILLE
          Really?  Well, come on, then.

     Camille hands Monica the cake.

                    CAMILLE (cont'd)
          Honey, put this in the kitchen.

                    NONA
          Help her, Quincy.

     Camille and Nona head down the hall, leaving Monica and
     Quincy alone.  The two just stand there.

     Quincy reaches out, scoops a finger of frosting, and pops it
     in his mouth.  Beat, then Monica takes a bigger scoop.

                    QUINCY
          So...does it hurt?

                    MONICA
          It's this big hole.  You could almost see
          bone.

                    QUINCY
          For real?

                    MONICA
          Uh huh.

     Quincy is impressed.

                    QUINCY
          So how come you could play basketball?

                    MONICA
          I just can.

                    QUINCY
          I never knew a girl that could play.

                    MONICA
          My Mom says she doesn't know where I come
          from 'cause I act different.

                    QUINCY
          Your Dad play?

                    MONICA
          He works at a bank.

                    QUINCY
          My Dad plays for the "Clippers."  He says
          I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma
          play for them, too.  Same number and
          everything.

                    MONICA
          I'm going to be number thirty-two, like
          Magic.

                    QUINCY
          He's alright, but my Dad can take him.

                    MONICA
          What was the most points your Daddy ever
          got in Junior High?

                    QUINCY
          I don't know.  A lot.

                    MONICA
          One time Magic scored forty-eight points,
          and they only had six minute quarters and
          he sat out the whole fourth.

                    QUINCY
          You do act different.

                    MONICA
          I don't care.

                    QUINCY
          Well, if anybody bothers you, you could
          just tell me cause I run this street.

                    MONICA
          I'd just tell my sister, Lena.

                    QUINCY
          She don't know how to box, I bet.  My dad
          showed me how to fight like Ali.

     He shows off a flurry of punches.

                    MONICA
          So, I know karate from "Almighty Isis."

     Monica puts the cake down on a box, does a couple of kicks
     and hand movements.  Quincy is impressed.

                    QUINCY
          Bet you can't do this though.

     Quincy does a jump kick.  Monica does the same.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          Okay, how bout this?

     Quincy takes a couple steps back, then does a cartwheel.  It
     looks great, until he crashes into the box with the cake.
     The cake falls onto his head and shoulder.

     Monica doubles over, laughing.  Quincy is embarrassed.
     Camille and Nona rush back into the living room.

                    CAMILLE
          Monica, what did you do?

                    MONICA
          Nothing.

                    CAMILLE
               (to Nona)
          Oh, all that work.

                    NONA
          It's...it's okay.  Can I get a towel?

     Camille quickly crosses into the kitchen.  Quincy stares at
     the floor.

                    QUINCY
          Sorry.

     Nona bends down, whispers in his ear.

                    NONA
          No.  Good boy.

     INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Monica sits between Lena's legs, grimacing, as Lena works a
     comb through her freshly washed, kinky hair.  Monica's head
     flops like a rag doll.  Her eyes are wet.

                    MONICA
          Ow!

     Lena keeps tugging.

                    MONICA (cont'd)
          Ow, Lena!!!

     Monica punches her in the leg.

                    LENA
          Ow!

     Lena yanks Monica's head back as Camille enters, carrying a
     yellow dress on a hanger.  Monica sees it and her face falls.

                    MONICA
          Ah, Mom.

                    CAMILLE
          I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your
          box of dresses under a pile of rags in
          the garbage.

     Monica sulks.  Lena cackles in her ear.  Camille has to
     laugh.

                    CAMILLE (cont'd)
          Child, pick up your lip.

                    MONICA
          I hate it.

                    CAMILLE
          Fine, you don't like this one, which one
          would you rather wear?

                    MONICA
          Pants.

     Camille rubs her temples, then hangs the dress on the door.

                    CAMILLE
               (to Lena)
          When you're done can you make sure she
          brushes her teeth?

                    LENA
          Are you okay?

                    CAMILLE
          I just need to lay down.  I've been
          running around all day.

     Just then, Nathan enters.  He holds up two dress shirts as if
     it were a matter of life and death.

                    NATHAN
          Which one for tomorrow?

                    CAMILLE
          The blue.

                    NATHAN
          You sure?

     Camille nods.  Nathan looks at both of them, then:

                    NATHAN (cont'd)
          Can you iron both tonight just in case?

                    CAMILLE
               (beat)
          Okay.

                    NATHAN
          Thanks, sweetheart.

     He kisses her on the cheek, hands her the two shirts and
     crosses out.  Monica just watches.  Beat, then Camile turns
     back to her daughters.

                    CAMILLE
          The boy next door is riding with you to
          school so you'll know somebody your first
          day.
               (to Lena)
          Hurry so she can go to sleep.

     Monica reacts, surprised.  Camille leaves.  Lena puts the
     comb back to Monica's hair.  Beat, then:

                    MONICA
          Make it look nice, kay.

     INT. MCCALL HOUSE - QUINCY'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Basketball posters, "Clippers" and USC memorabilia, a
     basketball globe light.

     Quincy lays tucked in bed, eyes wide open, listening to his
     parents MAKING LOVE.  The sounds bring a smile to his face.

     Quincy climbs out of bed, wearing underwear.  He moves to his
     window, sees Monica through her window directly across from
     his.  Her eyes are closed as Lena braids her hair.  Quincy
     kneels down, rests his arms on the window sill, and watches.
     
     
       EXT. MCCALL AND WRIGHT HOUSES - MORNING



     Quincy sits atop his BMX bike in front of Monica's house.  A
     basketball is tucked under his arm.

     Monica emerges, walking her banana-seater.  She is looking
     cute in her yellow dress and braids tied with ribbons.  A
     basketball sits in her back basket.

     Quincy is taken aback, stares at her.

                    QUINCY
          You wanna be my girl?

     Monica blinks in surprise.  She thinks for a moment.

                    MONICA
          What do I have to do?

                    QUINCY
          I guess, you know, we play ball and we
          ride to school together.  And if you get
          mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.

                    MONICA
          I don't like flowers.

                    QUINCY
          Oh.

                    MONICA
          How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever
          buy them.

                    QUINCY
          Kay.

                    MONICA
          Okay.

     An awkward beat between the new couple.  Finally --

                    QUINCY
          I think we gotta kiss now.

                    MONICA
          For how long?

                    QUINCY
          Five seconds.

     The two glance around, then climb off their bikes and walk to
     the secluded area between their two houses.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          Ready?

     Monica nods.  They lean in, eyes wide open, and touch lips.
     Quincy counts to five with his fingers.  They pull away,
     embarrassed, and walk back to the driveway.

     Monica lifts her bike from the ground and climbs on.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          Wait.  Cause you're my girl now you
          gotta ride my bike.

                    MONICA
          I want to ride my own bike.

                    QUINCY
          My Dad always drives my Mom.

                    MONICA
          So?

                    QUINCY
               (impatient)
          So that means I have to ride with you.

     Monica doesn't move.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          Come on.

                    MONICA
          I don't have to do what you say.

                    QUINCY
          Man, forget you then, stupid.

                    MONICA
          You're stupid.  And your Daddy plays for
          the worst team in the NBA.

     Quincy's face instantly clouds.

                    QUINCY
          What?

                    MONICA
               (laughs)
          Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.

                    QUINCY
          Shut up!

     He shoves her, knocking her off her bike.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          I don't wanna be your boyfriend, you ugly
          dog!

     Monica leaps up, her dress now dirty.  She shoves him back.

                    MONICA
          I don't want to be your girlfriend, big
          head!

     They grapple, then fall to the ground swinging...

     BLACK.

     FOOTAGE.  Men's NCAA Finals.  Michigan State against Indiana

       FADE IN:



     TITLE CARD: "SECOND QUARTER" then "1988"



     INT. CRENSHAW HIGH SCHOOL GYM - DAY



     A snarling Black cougar glares down from a large mural.  On

     the court below, a girl's basketball play-off game.

     The bleachers are almost half-full with a hyped crowd.  In
     the crowd are Monica's parents.  Her father is excited and
     vocal.  Her mom reads a book.  Also in the stands, the HEAD
     COACH OF THE TENNESSEE LADY VOLS, PAT SUMMIT.

     A fine-ass BROTHER leans in the doorway, sporting a letter
     jacket with an embroidered "Q" on the chest.  He gets as much
     attention as the game.  A couple of JUNIOR VARSITY
     CHEERLEADERS smile his way.

                    CHEERLEADERS
          "U", "G", "L", "Y", you ain't got no
          alibi, you ugly, yeah, yeah, you ugly.
          "M", "A", "M", "A", how you think you got
          that way, your Mama, yeah, yeah, your
          Mama.

     On the floor, MONICA, dribbles down court.  Just EIGHTEEN,
     her athletic figure has a few curves, but her loose jersey
     does little to show it off.  Her hair is a mess and her knees
     are dark with bruises.  A small scar is visible on her cheek.

     She whips a no-look, around the back pass to a cutting
     TEAMMATE under the basket, who scores.  The crowd cheers.

     Monica defends the opposing point guard like a gnat.  She
     knocks the ball loose and grabs it up.  She goes for a lay-up
     and the opposing guard steps in front of her.  Monica crashes
     into her, knocking both to the floor.

     A WHISTLE.

                    REFEREE
          No basket!  Offensive foul, number thirty-
          two.

     Monica leaps up.

                    MONICA
          What?  She wasn't set!

     The referee ignores her.

                    MONICA (cont'd)
          She was still moving!

     From the sideline, COACH HISERMAN waves frantically.

                    COACH HISERMAN
          Monica!  Let it go!

     Monica stares down the ref as she jogs back on defense.

     The opposing guard drives the lane and puts up a shot.
     Monica leaps and blocks it with a taunting scream.  A
     WHISTLE.

                    REFEREE
          Technical foul!  Number thirty-two.

     Coach Hiserman slams down his clipboard.  Monica charges the
     referee.  A teammate grabs at her but she pushes her off.

                    MONICA
          For what?

                    REFEREE
          Taunting.

                    MONICA
          Taunting?!

                    COACH HISERMAN
          Sub!

                    MONICA
          Man, you suck!

     The referee whips back around, whistle in mouth.  Coach
     Hiserman grabs her arm and pulls her off the court.

                    COACH HISERMAN
          Sit down and shut up.

     Monica slams down in a chair, sweat pouring, hands clenched.
     Her mom watches from the stands, completely embarrassed.  The
     brother in the doorway turns, leaves.

     Monica looks up at the clock.  SIX MINUTES LEFT IN THE THIRD
     QUARTER.

                                           DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. CRENSHAW HIGH SCHOOL GYM - LATE DAY

     Monica, still benched, sits slumped in her chair, her sweats
     on, her face dry.  She glances up at the clock.  TWENTY
     SECONDS LEFT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.  Her team's up by SIX.

     Her teammates dribble out the clock.  The BUZZER SOUNDS and
     they dance across the floor.  Monica looks up in the stands.
     COACH SUMMIT IS GONE.

     INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK

     Camille, now forty-three, stands at the stove stirring a pot
     of gumbo.  Lena, 21, and pretty, stands next to her, holding
     a handful of plates and silverware.

                    CAMILLE
          ...and if you want a thicker base, you
          can cut in a potato or just use a little
          flour.

                    LENA
          But you use potato?

     Camille nods as they cross into:

     INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     At the table, Monica is in mid-conversation with her dad.
     Camille and Lena start setting the table.

                    MONICA
          Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.

                    NATHAN
          And what am I supposed to say to the man?

                    MONICA
          The coach from Tennessee was there and he
          has me riding the bench.

                    NATHAN
          You lost your head.

                    MONICA
          I was just showing emotion.

                    CAMILLE
          So that means it's alright for you to act
          like that?

                    LENA
               (to Monica)
          What'd you do?

                    MONICA
               (dismissive)
          nothing.

                    CAMILLE
          I don't know why I keep hoping you'll
          grow out of this tomboy thing.

                    MONICA
          I won't.  I'm a lesbian.

     Lena chokes on her drink, cracks up.

                    CAMILLE
          That's not funny

                    MONICA
          Well, that's what you think, isn't it?
          Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an
          apron...

                    CAMILLE
          Watch your mouth.

     Nathan quickly jumps in, tries to clean things up.

                    NATHAN
          Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's
          time to start thinking about other things
          besides basketball.

                    MONICA
               (taken aback)
          What?

                    NATHAN
          You only have one game left and you
          haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I
          wanted it as bad as you did, but we have
          to face reality.

                    MONICA
          The coach from USC is going to be at the
          championship.

                    NATHAN
          I know.  But chances are...

                    MONICA
          Chances are there's still a chance.

     Nathan nods.  She can always soften her dad, but not her mom.

                    CAMILLE
          If you'd just listen for once, you'd
          realize you have a lot more going for
          yourself.  You're smart, you'd be pretty
          if you put a comb to your head.  I mean,
          why walk around with your hair looking
          like "whodunit"...?

     As her mom nags on, Monica looks out the window.

     OUTSIDE, QUINCY and a GIRL lean against a car parked at the
     curb, slobbing each other down.

     Just shy of 18, with a magnetic face and muscular body, he is
     a brother who drank his chocolate milk.  HE IS ALSO THE
     BROTHER WHO WAS WATCHING MONICA'S GAME FROM THE GYM DOORWAY.

     Monica watches and her mom's droning voice disappears...

     EXT. MCCALL HOUSE - SAME TIME

     FELICIA, 17, can't get enough of Quincy's lips.

                    QUINCY
          Yo, Felicia, I gotta get to my game.

     She keeps kissing him.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          And my mom's about to be home.

                    FELICIA
          So I'm not good enough to meet your mom?

                    QUINCY
          Girl, she knew I had a hottie like you
          up inhere, she'd beat the black off me.

                    FELICIA
               (kissing him again)
          That's a lot of beating.

     She finally lets go, and slides into her car.  Quincy watches
     her go with a cocky-ass smile.
     

       INT. CRENSHAW HIGH SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT



     A frenzied crowd from floor to ceiling watches Quincy explode

     across the court.  He is the complete point guard - hitting
     from the outside, driving to the hoop, no-look passes,
     playing tight D.'

     His father, Zeke, now 39, stands on the sideline.  His muscle
     has softened a little over the last five years of retirement.

     Monica sits alone in the bottom row, holding a basketball.
     She wears jeans and a T-shirt and her hair is pulled back in
     a simple pony-tail.

     Quincy does a killer cross-over move and his Defender falls
     down.  He lays up the ball, then taunts the player he just
     poster-ized.  Behind Monica, TWO GIRLS smack each other
     excitedly.  One of them, SHAWNEE, 17, pretty, big chest,
     slides down into the empty seat next to her.

                    SHAWNEE
          Hey, girl.

                    MONICA
          Hey.

                    SHAWNEE
          Your hair looks so cute like that.

     Monica knows she's full of shit, doesn't respond.

                    SHAWNEE (cont'd)
          So...you know who Q's asking to the
          Spring Dance?

                    MONICA
          No.

                    SHAWNEE
          C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's
          been creeping?

                    MONICA
          There's so many I just can't keep track.

                    SHAWNEE
          Well, can you give him this for me?

     Shawnee holds out a folded note.  Monica doesn't take it.

                    MONICA
          Give it yourself.

                    SHAWNEE
          I don't wanna look fast.
               (drops it in Monica's lap)
          Thanks, girl.

     She slides back to her seat.  Monica shakes her head, turns
     back to the game.

     Quincy dives for a loose ball.  Shawnee clutches her friend.

                    SHAWNEE (cont'd)
          Good Lord, look at that ass.  I just want
          to lick the sweat off it.

     Monica takes in his tight body.  He does look good.  Quincy
     jogs back down court and flashbulbs go off...

                                          MATCH CUT TO:

     INT. CRENSHAW HIGH SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT

     Flashbulbs.  Quincy stands with his dad, his sweat still
     fresh, talking to a reporter named JIM.

                    JIM
          Quincy, word has it you might make the
          jump the NBA.

                    ZEKE
          Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's
          college bound with or without basketball.

                    JIM
          You could make a career by telling me
          where.

                    ZEKE
          Gotta wait til the press conference.

                    JIM
          But you'd love for him to play at USC,
          like you did.

                    ZEKE
          I'd love for him to get a good education.
               (then)
          That's it.

     Jim crosses away.  Zeke puts an affectionate arm around his
     son as they walk toward the locker room.

                    ZEKE (cont'd)
          We should have another talk with Coach
          Carril at Princeton.

                    QUINCY
          Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is
          going all the way.

                    ZEKE
          I don't care about the team.  I care
          about the school.

                    QUINCY
          Didn't we already have this conversation?

     Zeke sighs, then:

                    ZEKE
          You played good.  I was proud of you.

     Quincy smiles wide.

                    QUINCY
          Yeah?
               (then)
          So you up for a game later?

                    ZEKE
          I don't wanna hurt your feelings.

                    QUINCY
          You don't wanna hurt your back.

                    ZEKE
               (smiles)
          Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting.
          Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.

                    QUINCY
          You work too hard, Pop.

                    ZEKE
          Let's hope I can say the same about you
          one day.

     Quincy watches his dad move toward the doors, stopping once
     to give an autograph.  Zeke passes Monica, entering.

                    MONICA
          Hey, Mr. M.

                    ZEKE
          Hey, Miss Baller.

     He exits.  Monica approaches Quincy.

                    MONICA
          Way to hoop.

                    QUINCY
          I know this.  What do you want?

                    MONICA
          A ride home.

                    QUINCY
          Your legs don't look broke.

                    MONICA
          Look, big head, I'll be at your car.

                    QUINCY
          Guess "please" would be a stretch.

                    MONICA
               (dryly)
          Please.

       INT. QUINCY'S JEEP - NIGHT



     Silence as Quincy wheels his Jeep Wrangler toward home.
     Monica sits in the passenger seat, basketball in lap.  She
     pulls Shawnee's note from her pocket.  Quincy glances it
     over.


                    QUINCY
          What's that?

                    MONICA
          Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give
          to you.

                    QUINCY
               (thinks)
          Big-ass titties?

     Monica shoots him a disgusted look.  Quincy reaches out.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          Give it here.

     Monica leans away, reads aloud.

                    MONICA
          "Q.  I think you are so fine and I've
          been wanting to get with you.  Let me
          take you to the Spring Dance and I
          promise I'll leave you satisfied."

     Monica laughs in disbelief.

                    MONICA (cont'd)
          What a ho.

                    QUINCY
          Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she
          wants to get with me.

                    MONICA
          She's a ho cause she's sending her
          coochie through the mail.

                    QUINCY
          And?

                    MONICA
          And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a
          nice guy and I wanna get to know you
          better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."

                    QUINCY
          So she's honest.

                    MONICA
          Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I
          guess you'll stick your dick in anything.

                    QUINCY
          Didn't know you cared so much.

                    MONICA
          I don't.

                    QUINCY
          So who you going to the dance with,
          Spalding?

                    MONICA
          Who's Spalding?

     Quincy looks down at the SPALDING BASKETBALL in her lap and
     cracks up.  Monica glares.

                    MONICA (cont'd)
          Fuck you, Quincy.

                    QUINCY
          See, that's why you ain't getting
          recruited.

                    MONICA
          Who said I'm not getting recruited?

                    QUINCY
          Your hot-ass temper.

     Monica points to the scar on her cheek.

                    MONICA
          I'm not the one who put this scar here.

                    QUINCY
          God, here we go.

                    MONICA
          When we were eleven years old cause he
          was about to lose.

     Quincy turns, faces her.

                    QUINCY
          That's it, give it your best shot.

                    MONICA
          Would you watch the damn road?

                    QUINCY
          I mean it, give it your best shot, cause
          I'm tired of you holding that over my
          head.

                    MONICA
          I'm warning you, don't tempt me.

                    QUINCY
          I'm warning you.  You don't stall that
          bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.

     Quincy pulls his Jeep into his driveway.

                    MONICA
          Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk
          smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But
          because I'm a female, I get told to calm
          down and act like a "lady".  I'm a
          ballplayer, okay.  A ball player.

                    QUINCY
          With a jacked-up attitude.

                    MONICA
          Didn't know you cared so much.

                    QUINCY
          I don't.

                    MONICA
          Good.

     Monica slams out of the Jeep and walks across the lawn to her
     house.  Quincy exits his ride.
     
       INT. MCCALL HOUSE - ENTRY WAY - SHORT TIME LATER



     Quincy steps inside, drops his bag on the floor.  His mom,
     Nona, approaches from the dining room.

                    QUINCY
          What's up, Moms.

     Nona holds up a large hoop earring.

                    NONA
          What is this?

                    QUINCY
          Uh, your earring?

                    NONA
          I look like some hoochie to you?  I
          found it on your floor.

                    QUINCY
          What are you doing in my room?

     Quincy crosses into:

     INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     Nona follows.  Quincy pulls open the fridge, grabs a couple
     of slices of cold pizza.

                    NONA
          Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass
          girls.

                    QUINCY
          We were just studying.

                    NONA
          I'm not playing with you, these girls are
          looking to get you caught.  They see you,
          they see dollar signs.

                    QUINCY
          Okay.

                    NONA
          You hearing me?

                    QUINCY
          I've been hearing you.

     Nona eyes her son, then lets up.  She gives him a kiss.

                    NONA
          How was your game?

                    QUINCY
          Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and
          still undefeated.

                    NONA
          Still the man.

                    QUINCY
          Yup.

     Nona smiles, starts back the kitchen.

                    NONA
          Where's your dad?

                    QUINCY
          Said he'd be home later.

                    NONA
          Later when?

                    QUINCY
          I don't know, he had a meeting or
          something.

     Quincy exits to his room.

     INT. MCCALL HOUSE - ZEKE AND NONA'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT

     Nona angrily rolls her hair as Zeke undresses.

                    ZEKE
          I had some players to see and hands to
          shake.

                    NONA
          At one in the morning?

                    ZEKE
          I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a
          clock just so my wife doesn't get an
          attitude.

                    NONA
          I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about
          to come second to this bullshit scouting
          job.

     Zeke looks at her, offended.

                    NONA (cont'd)
          I didn't mean it like that.

                    ZEKE
          Yeah.

                    NONA
          I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found
          time for your family.
          You should see the tramps coming after
          Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...

                    ZEKE
          I have.

     A beat.

                    NONA
          You said you'd think about going back to
          get your degree.

                    ZEKE
          No, you said I should get my degree.  I
          like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it's
          gonna lead to a spot in the front office.
          Til then, don't worry, there's just
          enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci
          and gold.

     Livid, Nona pulls off her gold bracelet, throws it at him.

                    NONA
          Fine, then how many nights home is that?

                    ZEKE
          Keep your voice down.

     She grabs a pair of gold earrings from her jewelry box, nails
     him.

                    NONA
          How about now?  I got a week yet?

     INT. MCCALL HOUSE - QUINCY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Quincy lies in bed, staring at the ceiling, as his parents
     continue to have it out.

     He rolls out of bed, pulls on a pair of shorts and a T-shirt.
     He moves to his window, pulls it open and climbs out...

     EXT. MCCALL AND WRIGHT HOUSES - CONTINUOUS

     Quincy crosses the grass to Monica's window, knocks quietly.

     Long beat, then Monica sleepily stumbles to her window,
     wearing boxers and a tank top.  She pushes it open and Quincy
     pulls himself through...

     INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Now a routine, Monica tosses Quincy one of her pillows and
     blankets, then crawls back into bed.
     He lays out on the floor and closes his eyes.  Monica casts a
     long, sleepy glance at him, then drifts back to sleep.

                                           DISSOLVE TO:
                                        
       INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - LATE DAY



     Posters of Magic line three walls.  A hand-made collage of

     female college and Olympic ball-players fills the fourth.
     The only real "soft" touch is the teddy bear laying on the
     pillow.

     Monica sits on the floor between Lena's legs, as Lena puts
     Monica's hair in cornrows.

                    LENA
          That too tight?

                    MONICA
          No.

                    LENA
          Mom's going to hate it.

                    MONICA
          Always on my ass, anyway.

                    LENA
          Like you don't give her a hard time.

                    MONICA
          Just cause I don't kiss her booty like
          you...

     Lena yanks Monica's head back.

                    MONICA (cont'd)
          Ow!!!

                    LENA
          You need to.  She's alone in this house
          all day, taking care of Dad and your
          ungrateful behind.

                    MONICA
          No one's forcing her.

                    LENA
          Just try and chill a little bit, alright.

     Monica doesn't answer.  Lena yanks her head back again.

                    MONICA
          Ow!!!  Okay!

     They crack up.

                    LENA
          So what's going on with the Spring Dance?
          You have a date yet?

                    MONICA
               (sarcastically)
          Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.

                    LENA
          I found you someone.

                    MONICA
          Found?  I'm not some charity case.

                    LENA
          I know...

                    MONICA
          Mom tell you to do this?

                    LENA
          No.

                    MONICA
          Damn, Lena...
               (then)
          Who is he?

                    LENA
          This brother from my college.

                    MONICA
          He's in college?

                    LENA
          And he's fine, girl.

                    MONICA
          How'd you get him to say yes?

                    LENA
          I told him you looked like me.

                    MONICA
          Oh, great.

                    LENA
          You do.

                    MONICA
          Yeah, right.

                    LENA
          If you were tore up I would not be
          claiming you.  Trust.

     Monica is not convinced.

                    LENA (cont'd)
          We'll do something cute with your hair,
          get you a dress, get you some heels...

                    MONICA
          I don't know how to walk in heels.

                    LENA
          Hey.  You just worry about playing your
          behind off for that recruiter tonight.
          Let me worry about your date.

     Lena starts to braid Monica's hair again.  Beat, then...

                    MONICA
          You ever been in love?

                    LENA
          Too many times.

                    MONICA
          They ever love you back?

                    LENA
          Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?

     Monica just shrugs.  Lena continues braiding.
     
     
       EXT. MCCALL HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - LATE DAY

     Quincy and Zeke sweat through a playfully intense game of one-
     on-one.

     Quincy almost breaks Zeke's ankles with a cross-over dribble,
     and leaves him in the dust.  He stops under the basket, waves
     for his Dad to come on before laying it up.

     Zeke smiles, tells Quincy to bring that shit on again.
     Quincy tries his cross-over again and this time Zeke picks
     him clean.

     Zeke taunts him as he easily backs in on him to the basket.

     INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK

     Camille stands at the stove, cooking up some yams.  Monica
     enters with a gym bag over her shoulder, dribbling her ball.
     THE HOOD OF HER SWEATSHIRT COVERS HER HAIR.

                    CAMILLE
          Monica, please.

     Monica stops.

                    MONICA
          Sorry.
               (then)
          I'm leaving.

     Camille fills a spoon from the pot, holds it out.

                    CAMILLE
          Taste this.

                    MONICA
          I can't eat before a game.

                    CAMILLE
          Child, take a bite.

     Monica sighs, takes a bite.  It's good.

                    CAMILLE (cont'd)
          I found some apricot chutney and mixed it
          with the yams.

                    MONICA
          You really should be a caterer or
          something like you used to say.

                    CAMILLE
          Sure.  In between all the other things I
          have to do.

     She pulls off Monica's hood, then stops when she sees her
     braids.  Monica looks back defiantly.

                    MONICA
          What?

                    CAMILLE
          Nothing.  So good luck.

     She forces a smile, turns back to her cooking.  Monica just
     nods, and crosses out.

     INT. CRENSHAW HIGH SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT

     The championship game.  The bleachers are almost filled.
     Nathan and Lena sit, dead center.  ALSO IN ATTENDANCE, COACH
     CHERYL MILLER - THE COACH OF USC.

     Quincy sits in the back row with a couple of teammates.  As
     always, he's the focus of much attention.

     Monica and her teammates are crouched in a tight huddle,
     surrounding Coach Hiserman.

                    COACH HISERMAN
          I don't have to tell you girls how big
          this game is.  We worked too damn hard
          all season to leave without this
          championship.  So let's play smart...
               (looks at Monica)
          ...let's play in control, and let's kick
          some butt.  Cougars on three.
          Once...two...three.

                    TEAM
          Cougars!

     As Monica moves to center court, she glances up at the USC
     Coach, then at Quincy.

     Monica takes a deep breath as she lines up for the opening
     tip.  An opposing player suddenly bumps her out of position.
     Monica glares at her, but just moves over.

     The ball is tossed up...

                                          SMASH CUT TO:

     INT. CRENSHAW GYM - NIGHT

     Fourth quarter.  One minute left.  Cougars down three.

     Monica dribbles down court, bouncing with confidence as her
     opponent plays her tight.

     Monica zips a no-look pass to a teammate, who lays it up.
     Quincy punches one of his friends - "Oh shit!"  She is having
     the game of her life.

     On the defensive end, Monica steals the ball.  She drives the
     length of the court, lays it up between two defenders.  The
     crowd is hyped.

     Twenty seconds left, up by one.  Monica hounds the opposing
     guard as she brings up the ball.
     Monica suddenly reaches in and knocks the ball loose.  As she
     goes for the ball, a WHISTLE.

                    REFEREE
          Reaching in, number thirty-two.  One-and-
          one.

     Boos fill the gym.  Monica's eyes widen.

                    MONICA
          No!

     Anger rushes through her as she starts for the ref.

                    MONICA (cont'd)
          That's bullsh--!

                    COACH HISERMAN
          Monica!

     Monica catches herself, turns the word "shit" into a
     frustrated yell as she quickly moves away from the ref.

     Monica lines up for the free-throw, clenching her fists.  The
     girl hits the first one.  Then, she hits the second.

     With ten seconds left, down by one, Monica drives down court
     and throws up a prayer.  EVERYONE IS ON THEIR FEET AS THE
     BALL SPINS AROUND THE RIM.  AND THEN...IT POPS OUT.  An
     opposing player grabs the rebound and Monica has no choice
     but to foul her.

     Monica has just fouled out.  She walks to her bench and drops
     down.  She buries her face in a towel and sobs.

     The buzzer goes off.  Cougars lose.

     Quincy stares at Monica, feeling almost as bad as she does.

                                           DISSOLVE TO:
                                        
                                        
       INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - NIGHT



     Monica sits slumped on her bed in a bathrobe, as Lena stands

     in front of her, putting the finishing touches on Monica's

     make-up.



                    LENA

          Might help if you didn't look so evil.

                    MONICA
          I don't even want to go.

     She steps back, looks at her work.
  
                    LENA
          Mom!

     Beat, then Camille enters.
  
                    LENA (cont'd)
          Talk to me.

     Camille stares at her daughter, taken aback by how great she
     looks.

                    CAMILLE
          Go in my top drawer and get my pearls.

     Lena exits.  Monica still looks miserable.

                    CAMILLE (cont'd)
          You okay?

     Monica shrugs.

                    CAMILLE (cont'd)
          Well, can you promise me one thing?

                    MONICA
          What?

                    CAMILLE
          Tonight, don't worry about yesterday's
          game, the recruiters, or anything else.
          I just want you to enjoy being beautiful.
          Will you do that?

     Monica takes this in as Lena returns with Camille's pearls.

                    LENA
          Here.

     Camille puts them around Monica's neck.  Monica looks back at
     her.

                    MONICA
          You really think I look beautiful?

     Camille smiles at her daughter, nods.  Monica touches the
     pearls.

     INT. CRENSHAW GYM - NIGHT

     An R&B song jams through the speakers, filling the dance
     floor with high school kids in suits and dresses.

     In the middle of the floor, Quincy gets his groove on with
     his date, Shawnee.  She dances so provocatively, there is no
     mistaking what she has in mind for later.

     Over at the doors, Monica enters with her college date,
     JASON, 21, and fine.  Heads turn in surprise.  Monica feels
     the stares, shifts nervously.

                    JASON
          Can I take your coat?

                    MONICA
          You're cold?

     Monica starts to pull it off.

                    JASON
          No, I mean I can check it for you.

                    MONICA
               (embarrassed)
          Oh, sorry.

     Jason pulls off her coat, revealing a dress that shows off
     everything Monica has been hiding.  He checks out her frame,
     smiles.

                    JASON
          Your sister wasn't lying.

     He crosses to the coat check, leaving her alone.

     ANGLE ON

     Quincy, who glances over from the middle of the dance floor,
     and abruptly stops.  He stares at Monica in shock.

                    QUINCY
          Oh...shit.

     Quincy starts off the floor as a new song kicks in.

                    SHAWNEE
          Q, I like this song...

     ANGLE ON

     Monica, sees Quincy approaching in his suit.  She quickly
     steadies herself on her heels, brushes a curl from her face.

                    QUINCY
          See you made it.

                    MONICA
          Yeah.

                    QUINCY
          You don't look half-bad.

                    MONICA
          You either.

     Jason returns.  Quincy looks at him, surprised.

                    JASON
          What's up, Black.  I'm Jason.

                    QUINCY
          Q.

     Shawnee suddenly steps up, slides her arms around Quincy.

                    SHAWNEE
          Dang, girl, I didn't know Nike made
          dresses.

     Monica looks at Shawnee, wrapped around Quincy.  She can't
     believe it.

                    MONICA
          Guess we'll see you later.

     Monica heads into the crowd with her college man.  Quincy
     watches her go.

     INT. CRENSHAW HIGH SCHOOL GYM - LATER

     Monica sits at a table with Jason.  His arm lays casually
     across the back of her chair.  Monica sits upright, stiff.

                    JASON
          So, you like school?

     Monica smiles nervously, nods.

                    JASON (cont'd)
          Yeah, high school was cool.  I don't
          remember sisters being as fine as you,
          though.

     Monica just holds that nervous smile.

                    JASON (cont'd)
          So what do you like studying?

                    MONICA
          Gym.

     He waits for more, but nothing comes.

                    JASON
          I'm an English major.  You like English?

                    MONICA
          Sort of.

                    JASON
          Careful.

                    MONICA
          Huh?

                    JASON
          That was two words.

     Monica ducks her head, embarrassed.  Jason laughs.

                    JASON (cont'd)
          Girl, how come you're so stressed?

                    MONICA
          Sorry.

                    JASON
          I mean, I'm having a good time with
          you...

     His arm slides off the back of her chair and onto her
     shoulders.

                    JASON (cont'd)
          So tell me what I have to do to make you
          have a good time with me.

                    MONICA
          My mouth is kinda dry.

                    JASON
          Then I'll get you some punch.

     He stands, then.

                    JASON (cont'd)
          Just don't jet while I'm gone and leave a
          glass slipper behind.

     Monica's face lights up.  Jason smiles.

                    JASON (cont'd)
          There we go.

     He crosses away to the refreshment table.  Monica smiles
     wider, leans back in her chair with her legs splayed.  She
     catches herself and quickly crosses them.

     A couple of guys pass by and check her out.  Monica smiles
     wider.  Quincy steps up, holding two cups of punch.

                    QUINCY
          Hey.

                    MONICA
          Hey.

                    QUINCY
          You having fun?

                    MONICA
          Yeah.

                    QUINCY
          Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.
               (beat)
          So who is this clown?

                    MONICA
          He ain't Spalding.

                    QUINCY
          Guess not.

                    MONICA
          So you took Shawnee, huh?

     The DJ puts on "Make It Last Forever" by Keith Sweat.
     Couples move to the dance floor.

                    QUINCY
               (embarrassed)
          You know, it was late and she asked...

                    JASON
          You want to dance?

     Jason stands behind her chair.  Monica smiles shyly.

                    MONICA
          Sure.

     Jason puts down her cup of punch, takes her hand, leads her
     to the dance floor.

     Quincy just shakes his head, then crosses to his table, grabs
     Shawnee's hand.

                    QUINCY
          C'mon.

     He pulls Shawnee to the middle of the floor.

     ANGLE ON

     Monica, nervous at first, a little awkward, but Jason gently
     guides her in a slow circle and she starts to relax.

     Jason moves his hands down Monica's back, pulling her in
     closer.  Shawnee snuggles into Quincy's chest, runs her hands
     down his neck.  The heat from bodies grows.

     Monica and Quincy glance up at the same time and catch each
     other's eyes.  They start to look away but find they can't.
     Eyes locked as they dance, they move together, almost feel
     each other.  Finally, as their bodies turn, they lose sight.

     Monica puts her head to Jason's chest, Quincy slides his
     hands lower down Shawnee's back.  The music continues...

     INT. JASON'S CAR - NIGHT

     Jason and Monica are parked up on Mulholland Drive.  LL Cool
     J's "I Need Love" plays on the tape deck.

     Jason has his arm around Monica, ready to make his move.

                    MONICA
               (rattling)
          Freshman year, my free throw percentage
          was fifty-one percent, cause I was
          shooting it like a jump shot.

     Jason leans in, kisses her bare shoulder.

                    MONICA (cont'd)
          Um...but then sophomore year I was
          shooting seventy-five percent from the
          line.

     Jason kisses her neck.

                    MONICA (cont'd)
          ...uh, by keeping my feet set and really
          following through.

     Jason goes in for the slam dunk.  Kisses Monica on the lips.
     It's the first time she's really been kissed.  Jason pulls
     away, smiles.

                    JASON
          That was nice.

                    MONICA
          Uh-huh.

                    JASON
          Your sister told me hands off, but I
          can't help myself...

     Jason leans in.  Monica closes her eyes, and they kiss some
     more.  Monica tries to follow his practiced lips.

     Jason's tongue slides in and their bodies slide down.  His
     hand moves across her breast.  Monica's eyes pop open.

                    MONICA
          Wait...

                    JASON
          Shh.  It's okay.

     Naive and inexperienced, Monica shuts her eyes tight.

                                           DISSOLVE TO:
                                        
                                        
       E WRIGHT HOUSE -NIGHT



     Jason's car pulls off, Monica slowly moves to her front door.

     She looks in the living room window.  Her mom is asleep in a
     chair, trying to wait up.

     Monica catches her reflection in the window.  She glares at
     her made-up face, then wipes at her mouth with her hand.

     She steps back , walks to her bedroom window.  She pulls it
     open, kicks off her heels and climbs through.

     INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Monica moves to her bed and drops down.  She sits motionless
     for a beat, then suddenly feels something beneath her.  She
     reaches for it.  IT'S A LETTER FROM THE USC ATHLETIC
     DEPARTMENT.  Monica stares at it in her hands...

     Light suddenly cuts through the darkness.  Monica turns and
     is surprised to see Quincy standing in the middle of his
     room, pulling off his jacket.  Monica moves to her window,
     pulls it open.

                    MONICA
          Psst.

     Quincy looks over.  Beat.  Then he climbs out of his window,
     drops down.

     EXT. WRIGHT AND MCCALL HOUSES - CONTINUOUS

                    MONICA
          Early night for you, isn't it?

                    QUINCY
          I was about to ask you the same thing,
          going out with a college boy and all.

     Monica doesn't respond.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          So where'd you go after?

                    MONICA
               (beat)
          Mulholland Drive.

                    QUINCY
          Figures.

                    MONICA
          So what dead-end street did you and
          Shawnee hit?

                    QUINCY
          None of your business.

                    MONICA
          Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left
          you satisfied.

                    QUINCY
          That what you think?

     Monica shrugs.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          Little after you left, I told Shawnee it
          was time to go and I drove her ass
          straight home.  And after she told me I
          was the dumbest brother in the world, I
          took off.

                    MONICA
          Why?

                    QUINCY
          Cause I don't just stick my dick in
          anything.

     Monica takes this in.

                    MONICA
          I was sitting in Jason's ride with him
          kissing on me and feeling on me and it
          was really bugging me cause I couldn't
          remember how many offensive boards I had
          in the championship.  And then I guess
          she got tired of me sort of accidentally
          kneeing him in the balls.

     Beat, then Quincy cracks up.  Monica laughs with him.

                    QUINCY
          Four.

                    MONICA
          What?

                    QUINCY
          You had four offensive rebounds.

     Monica stares at him, surprised.  She thinks.

                    MONICA
          Hold up for a second.

     Monica disappears back inside.  Beat, then she re-appears.
     She climbs out her window, drops down.  Quincy looks at her.

     She holds out the envelope from USC.

                    QUINCY
          When'd you get this?

                    MONICA
          It was on my bed when I came in.
               (then)
          Can you just...?

                    QUINCY
               (beat)
          You sure?

     Monica nods.  Quincy takes the envelope, sits down on the
     grass.  Monica sits down beside him.  He tears open the
     envelope and pulls out the letter.

     Monica stares at him as he reads, trying to see an answer in
     his face.  Quincy finally looks up.  Expressionless.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          Damn girl...

     Monica's face falls.  And then, a slow smile spreads across
     Quincy's face.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          They want you.

     Monica grabs the letter, reads.  Her head just drops as a
     tidal wave of relief washes over her.

     Quincy smiles.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          Congratulations.

     Monica looks up, cheesing.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          I'm gonna be there, too.  I'm announcing
          tomorrow.

                    MONICA
          I knew it.

     Monica can't contain her excitement.  Without thinking, she
     gives Quincy a kiss.  They pull away, then break into nervous
     laughter.

                    QUINCY
          What was that about?

                    MONICA
          I know, right?

     But they both want more.  They lean in, kiss deeply.  They
     fall back on the grass.  And kiss.  And kiss.

     Suddenly, Monica pulls away, sits up.  Quincy follows,
     instantly apologetic.  Monica stares at him, then to his
     surprise, she reaches over, gives his shirt a small tug with
     her finger.

     Quincy stares at her, then slowly pulls off his tie.  He
     nervously unbuttons his shirt.  He fumbles with the last two
     buttons.

     Monica slowly pulls down the straps of her dress, self-
     conscious.  Quincy can't keep his eyes off her.

     He pulls off his pants.  Monica glances down and her eyes
     widen.  She looks scared to death.  Quincy smiles softly,
     leans in and gently kisses her.  She relaxes.  They lay down.

     Quincy reaches into his pants for a condom.  His hands shake
     as he puts it on.  They stare at each other as he moves on
     top of her.

     Quincy pushes inside her.  She flinches back in pain.  Quincy
     immediately stops as tears spring to her eyes.

                    QUINCY
               (softly)
          You want to stop?

     Monica shakes her head.  Quincy pushes inside again.  He
     looks down at her with tenderness, moves gently, kisses her
     tears...

                                         FADE TO BLACK.

     TITLE CARD: "THIRD QUARTER"

     INT. USC - CAMPUS GYM - MORNING

     Championship banners hang from the ceiling.

     TWELVE YOUNG WOMEN sit on the first two rows of bleachers.
     The eight upperclassmen kick back in the second row,
     comfortable, confident.  Monica and the three other freshmen
     sit in front of them, jiggling nervously.

     COACH MILLER stands in front of the team.

                    COACH MILLER
          I don't know some of you very well yet,
          and you don't know me because I'm still
          being nice to you.

     Laughter from the upperclassmen.

                    COACH MILLER (cont'd)
          But my philosophy is simple. Hard work
          and sacrifice.
          There's a lot of basketball history and
          pride here at USC, but just putting on
          the cardinal and gold doesn't make you a
          great player.  Hard work and sacrifice
          makes you a great player.  What you were
          doesn't matter anymore.  For the first
          time in your life, you won't be the best.
          You'll be going up against women that are
          bigger and stronger and better than you
          ever imagined.  So the question is, how
          will you respond?  Well, your answer
          better be hard work and sacrifice because
          that's the only way you're gonna make it
          through.  Vince Lombardi preached it and
          I teach it, "There is only one way to
          succeed at anything and that is to give
          everything."

     Coach Miller pauses a moment to let her words sink in.
     Monica glances at her fellow freshman for their reactions.
     Like her, a lot of cockiness, a lot of fear.

                    COACH MILLER (cont'd)
          A few simple rules.  Eleven o'clock
          curfew, no exceptions.  Always be on
          time, no exceptions.  Attend every class,
          no exceptions.  No drugs, no alcohol, no
          getting pregnant.  And finally, respect
          yourselves, respect your coaches and
          respect your teammates, right Sidra?

     SIDRA, senior point guard, nods from the second row.

                    SIDRA
          That's right, Coach.

                    COACH MILLER
          By the end of this year some of you will
          hate me...

     The upperclassmen crack up.

                    COACH MILLER (cont'd)
          Some of you will want to go home...

                    UPPERCLASSMEN
               (cat-calling)
          Cree!

     CREE, junior forward, ducks her head sheepishly.  Coach
     Miller smiles.

                    COACH MILLER
          But I guarantee you, if you work hard and
          sacrifice, all of you will be better
          basketball players and better people.

     Monica nods, accepting the challenge.

     EXT. TRACK - EARLY MORNING

     It's cold, it's dark.  It's six a.m.

     The team pounds down the track, pushing through a two-mile
     run.  Monica and her freshman teammate/roommate SHAYLA, 18,
     breathe heavily from the back of the pack.

     From the sideline.

                    COACH MILLER
          Let's go, freshmen, you're getting
          spanked!

     Monica sucks it up, runs faster.  She reaches the middle of
     the pack, then runs out of gas.  She drops back to the rear.

                    COACH MILLER (cont'd)
          Monica, I'm putting you on my Wizard of
          Oz team.  No brains, no courage and no
          heart!

     INT. CAMPUS GYM - MORNING

     Defensive drills.  One by one, players crouch low and move
     backwards down the sideline.  ZVETTE, a junior guard, hustles
     through the drill.

                    COACH MILLER
          Way to work, Zvette.

     Monica starts the drill.

                    COACH MILLER (cont'd)
          Get lower, Monica, move your feet.

     Monica grimaces as she squats lower.

                    COACH MILLER (cont'd)
          I said lower!

     Coach Miller stops her, squats down low beside her.

                    COACH MILLER (cont'd)
          This is low, got it?  Offense sells
          tickets, defense wins games!

     Monica starts again.

     INT. CAMPUS GYM - MORNING

     The team stands along the baseline.  Monica stands right
     below the free throw line.

     TONI, 6'4", 200 pound senior, drives the lane.  Monica steps
     in front of her, and is slammed to the floor.  She lays still
     for a moment, stunned by the impact.  Laughter from the
     baseline.

                    SIDRA
          Dag, you took her out, T.

     Teammates SANDRA and LISA crack up.

                    SANDRA
          I think she just said "Mommy."

                    LISA
          No, she said "mammary."

                    COACH MILLER
          Monica, you trying to tell me you can't
          take a little challenge?

     Monica crawls to her feet.

                    MONICA
          I can take it.

                    COACH MILLER
          This time get your feet set.

     Monica moves back into position.  Toni drives at her again.
     Monica steps in front of her, braces herself.  Toni slams
     into her and she hits the floor.  Monica blinks back the pain
     as she pops back up.

                    COACH MILLER (cont'd)
          Next!

     Monica wobbles back to the sideline.

     INT. WEIGHT ROOM - LATE DAY

     The team is spread out, lifting weights.  Monica lies on a
     weight bench, her arms shaking as she struggles to bench
     press fifty-pounds.  Sidra stands behind her, spotting.

                    SIDRA
          You got it, c'mon, lift!

     Monica lifts it with Sidra's help.

                    SIDRA (cont'd)
          That's it.

                    MONICA
          Coach hates me, doesn't she?

                    SIDRA
          She hates all freshmen.

     Monica scowls, discouraged.

                    MONICA
          What's up with that?

                    SIDRA
          Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't
          think just cause we play the same
          position we have to compete with each
          other.  We're teammates, okay?

                    MONICA
          Thanks, Sidra.

                    SIDRA
          Besides.  I've been starting point the
          last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb-
          ass freshman is taking my spot.

     Sidra walks off, leaving Monica with the bar on her chest.
     Finally, she has to drop the weight to the floor.

     EXT. USC CAMPUS - LATE MORNING

     Monica and Quincy walk to class, his arm draped casually
     across her shoulders.  Quincy gets looks and smiles.  Monica
     just looks exhausted.

                    MONICA
          You finish the reading for E-con?

                    QUINCY
          Yeah.

                    MONICA
          What'd it say?

                    QUINCY
          Basically broke down how I'm gonna make
          mad loot in the NBA, me being such a
          limited commodity and all.

                    MONICA
          Whatever, big head.

     Quincy laughs.  TWO GIRLS pass by, smile.

                    GIRL #1
          Hey, Q-man, you gonna take us to the
          Final Four?

                    QUINCY
          We'll see.

                    GIRL #2
          We'll be watching.

     The girls continue on.  Monica looks at Quincy.

                    QUINCY
          What?

                    MONICA
          You do see me standing here, right?

                    QUINCY
          I can't be nice to a fan?

                    MONICA
          Fine, Quincy.

                    QUINCY
          I can't help girls coming up to me.

                    MONICA
          I said fine.

     Quincy looks at her sulking.  He suddenly pulls her down onto
     the nearby lawn, and cradles her.

                    QUINCY
          It's okay, little baby.

                    MONICA
               (struggling)
          Quit.

     Quincy grips her tighter, rocks her.  Students pass by,
     laugh.

                    QUINCY
          Shhh.  Daddy's here.

     Monica finally cracks up.

                    MONICA
          You're such a punk.

     He gives her a kiss.

                    QUINCY
          All these girls...you're the only one I
          know who's for real.

     Monica smiles, kisses him back.

                    MONICA
          Always.

      INT. CAMPUS GYM - MORNING



     A heated scrimmage between the women's "A" team (the starting
     five) and "B" team (five who want to be starting).  Monica
     runs point for the "B" team, playing opposite Sidra.


     Sidra is all over Monica, slipping in cheap shots, but Monica
     starts to come on.  She does a quick cross-over and loses
     Sidra.  She dishes off to Shayla, who scores.

                    COACH MILLER
          Sidra!  You feel like playing any "D"?

     Sidra scowls as she runs down court.  She gets a pass in the
     corner, tires to make a move but Monica slaps the ball loose.

     Monica grabs it, drives to the three-point line, puts up the
     shot.  SWISH!  Monica stays posed, with her arm up.

     Sidra takes advantage, sprints back down court.  She get the
     long pass, lays it up.  Coach Miller blows her whistle.

                    COACH MILLER (cont'd)
          Monica!  Get over here.

     Monica jogs over, sheepish.

                    COACH MILLER (cont'd)
          While you're so busy posing, your man
          just scored!

     Monica drops her head.

                    COACH MILLER (cont'd)
          Show me again.

                    MONICA
          What?

                    COACH MILLER
          You love to pose so much, let's see it
          again.

     Beat, then Monica holds up her arm like she just shot the
     ball.  Snickers from her teammates.

                    COACH MILLER (cont'd)
          I want you to stand like that for the
          rest of practice.

                    MONICA
          Coach...

                    COACH MILLER
          I want you to stand like that until
          you're sick of it because I don't ever
          want to see it again, you hear me?
               (then)
          Dora, take her spot.

     DORA, freshman, jogs onto the court.  Coach Miller blows her
     whistle and the scrimmage resumes.

     Monica stands alone on the sideline, posing, and feeling like
     an asshole.

     INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATE MORNING

     Monica sits on the bench in front of her locker, dressing
     after the shower.  Shayla sits next to her.

     Nearby, Lisa and Sandra apply make-up in the mirror.  Zvette
     passes by, already dressed.  Lisa turns.

                    LISA
          Z, I know you're gonna shower first.

                    ZVETTE
          I don't smell bad.

                    SANDRA
          And you wonder why your ass sits alone on
          the bus.

     Cree glances over from another sink, as she snaps the chain
     on her CROSS NECKLACE.

                    CREE
          You guys curse too much.

                    SANDRA
          Since when is "ass" a curse?

     MAEYEN walks past.

                    MAEYEN
          Whoa, it's as big as yours.

     They crack up.  Cree just shakes her head.  Two TEAMMATES
     pass by Monica with their arms raised, mimicking her pose.
     Monica shakes her head.

     Sidra glances at Monica from her spot on the bench.

                    SIDRA
          That's what you get for trying to show
          out, freshman.

                    MONICA
          I was just playing ball.

                    SIDRA
          You were trying to make me look bad.

                    MONICA
          Didn't have to try very hard.

     Ears prick up around the locker room.  Sidra stands.

                    SIDRA
          Girl, don't you know you're just sloppy
          seconds?

     Monica rises.

                    MONICA
          What?

     Toni tries to step in.

                    TONI
          Sidra, let it go.

                    SIDRA
          Only reason you're here is cause Tonya
          Randall got pregnant and decided not to
          come.  They were done recruiting.

     KELLI, senior forward, shakes her head.

                    KELLI
          That's cold, Sid.

                    SIDRA
          Just thought the girl should know.

     Monica is stunned.  Sidra saunters to the showers.  Shayla
     nudges her with her shoulder.

                    SHAYLA
          Don't even trip.  She's just mad cause
          she's bow-legged.

       INT. USC SUITES - QUINCY'S ROOM - NIGHT



     Monica and Quincy lay feet to face on Quincy's twin bed.

     Monica's hand holds an ice bag on Quincy's hip.  Quincy's arm
     rests across an ice bag on Monica's ankle.

                    QUINCY
          Forget Tonya Randall.

                    MONICA
          I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was
          here instead of me.

                    QUINCY
          Then prove her wrong.

                    MONICA
          I don't have it easy like you, alright.
          There's no red carpet laid out for me.

                    QUINCY
          So you're gonna act salty all night?

     Quincy's roommate/teammate REGGIE, 18, suddenly pops his head
     into the room.

                    REGGIE
          Yo, dog, we're about to order some wings.

                    QUINCY
          Nah, thanks.

     Reggie shrugs, closes the door.  Quincy looks at Monica,
     still brooding.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          Fine.  Don't worry about proving
          everybody wrong, okay?  You can't handle
          the pressure, I'll understand.

                    MONICA
          That was so weak.

                    QUINCY
          Who cares if you're never known as the
          first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more
          play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.

     Monica shoves Quincy's ice bag down his sweat pants.  He
     leaps up.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          Aaaah!  Damn, girl!

                    MONICA
          That's what you get.

     He smiles as he pulls the ice.  Then looks her up and down.

                    QUINCY
          So how about a little one-on-one?

                    MONICA
          What are we playing for?

                    QUINCY
          Clothes.

                    MONICA
          What?

     Quincy locks the door, sets up his indoor hoop.

                    QUINCY
          I score, you strip.  You score, I drop
          something.

     Monica looks at him, then cracks up.

                    MONICA
          Give me the ball.

                    QUINCY
          My court, I go first.

     Quincy grips the ball.  Monica crouches low on defense.
     Quincy drives past her and slams down a vicious dunk.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          Strip.

     Monica makes a face, then pulls off her sweatshirt.  Quincy
     skips back.  Monica drops low again.  Quincy fakes her out
     and slams down another vicious dunk.  He laughs.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          Where's the "D"?

                    MONICA
          Kiss my booty.

                    QUINCY
          Plan to.

     Monica glares through her smile, then pulls off her T-shirt,
     leaving her in a bra and shorts.

     Quincy goes for another dunk, but this time, Monica reaches
     out, GRABS HIS DICK.  Quincy drops the ball.  Monica picks it
     up and lays it in.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          Hold up...

                    MONICA
          All's fair in love and basketball.
          Strip.

     Quincy pulls off his shirt.  Monica moves back into position.
     Quincy drops down low.  Monica fakes, gets him to leave his
     feet.  She slips under him and scores.  She laughs.

                    MONICA (cont'd)
          Too bad you got your mama's height, huh.

     Quincy pulls off his sweats, leaving him in just drawers.
     Monica takes in the view as she moves back into position.

     She holds the ball out, taunting.  Quincy pretends to reach
     for it, but grabs her breast instead.

                    QUINCY
          Oh, my bad.

     She drives.  Quincy just steps out of the way and lets her
     score.  Monica snatches the ball off the floor.

                    MONICA
          Yo, where's the "D"?

                    QUINCY
          Right here.

     Monica turns, finds Quincy butt-naked.  He moves her against
     the wall and kisses her.  Monica drops the ball, wraps her
     arms around him.  She smiles.

                    MONICA
          I won.

                    QUINCY
          I wanted you to.

     Game over.  They hit it.

     Sportscaster DICK VITALE talks animatedly about the upcoming
     season.

                    DICK VITALE
          It's the start of the new college season
          and I'm like a kid in a candy store.  Too
          many great teams to choose from.  You
          have your Dukes', Kentuckys', Arkansas',
          but my surprise treat this season...

     INT. BASKETBALL COURT

     Sportscaster ROBIN ROBERTS reports on the upcoming women's
     season.

                    ROBIN ROBERTS
          ...USC.  The women of Troy made it to the
          Sweet Sixteen last year and are returning
          four starters from that squad.  And many
          consider their recruiting class one of
          the best in the nation.  The highlight of
          that class,...

     INT. ESPN STUDIOS

                    DICK VITALE
          ...is Quincy McCall, one of my diaper
          dandies.  He's a real P.T.P., a prime-
          time player.  Every college in the
          country wanted him but he chose to follow
          in his father's footsteps and become a
          Trojan.  He's gonna have a lot on his
          shoulders this season...

     INT. BASKETBALL COURT

                    ROBIN ROBERTS
          ...but Coach Cheryl Miller feels that if
          just one of her freshmen has a breakout
          year, they can go all the way.  It's a
          long season, anything can happen, but one
          thing is for sure...

     INT. ESPN STUDIOS

                    DICK VITALE
          It's gonna be awesome, baby!

     MONTAGE:

     INT. SPORTS ARENA - NIGHT

     A hundred flashbulbs pop as Quincy jogs out to center court.
     The crowd goes crazy as...

     INT. CAMPUS GYM - NIGHT

     Monica sits on the bench, watching Sidra run the floor
     against UNLV, as...

     INT. SPORTS ARENA - NIGHT

     Quincy drives to the three-point line against Cal and puts it
     up.  It drops through the net.  He pounds his fist against
     the number twenty-two on his chest, nods to Zeke standing
     behind the bench, as...

     INT. CAMPUS GYM - NIGHT

     Coach Miller motions to Monica.  She jumps up, pulls off her
     sweats.  She jogs past Arizona bench and onto the floor,
     as...

     INT. SPORTS ARENA - NIGHT

     Quincy goes up for a dunk against North Carolina.  He jams it
     down, grips the rim, and pulls his legs up high, as...

     INT. KAISER ARENA - NIGHT

     Monica catches a long outlet pass.  She drops a no-look
     bounce pass between two Berkeley defenders, to a teammate who
     scores.  She jogs back, as...

     INT. SPORTS ARENA - NIGHT

     Zeke grips Quincy's head proudly, affectionately, as they
     walk off the floor after a game against Washington, as...

     INT. UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT - GAMPEL PAVILION - NIGHT

     Sidra crashes to the floor, immediately grabs at her ankle.
     Monica rises off the bench...

                                         CUT TO:
                                         
                                         
       INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT

     Televisions hang from every corner, broadcasting various
     games.

     Zeke and Quincy sit at a bar.  Quincy is still hyped from his
     game.

                    QUINCY
          ...up and under between two defenders,
          with the left hand.  That's gotta make
          SportsCenter.

     Zeke just nods as the Bartender/Owner crosses over.  He is an
     ex-ballplayer named TERRY.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          They can't stop me, Pop...

                    TERRY
          What are you having, Zeke?

                    ZEKE
          Genuine Draft.  And an orange juice for
          my kid.

                    TERRY
          Cross-over's looking good, Quincy.  I
          know your old man didn't teach you that.

                    ZEKE
          Didn't need a cross-over to post you up.

     Terry laughs as he moves off to fix the drinks.  Something is
     on Zeke's mind, but before he can speak on it...

                    QUINCY
          You know, the numbers I'm putting up are
          better than any freshman.  Some people
          are saying I'm a definite lottery pick.

     Zeke suddenly focuses.

                    ZEKE
          What people?

                    QUINCY
          You know, people.

                    ZEKE
          Well, tell them to mind their damn
          business.  You're smart enough to get a
          degree.

                    QUINCY
          I'm also good enough to go pro.

                    ZEKE
          You know how much higher the play level
          is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to
          develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The
          NBA ain't going nowhere.

                    QUINCY
          You came out early.

                    ZEKE
          Your mom got pregnant and I had to make
          choices.  You don't have a choice.

                    QUINCY
          Okay...

     Silence, then.

                    ZEKE
          Besides, the sooner you go pro, the
          sooner you'll have to deal with the mess
          I'm dealing with.

                    QUINCY
          What mess?

                    ZEKE
          there's this thing out there.  This
          paternity suit.

                    QUINCY
          What?

                    ZEKE
          Some girl that's been hanging on at every
          party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's
          Daddy.
               (then)
          Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be
          the one who told you.

                    QUINCY
          Tell me what?

                    ZEKE
          I just told you.

                    QUINCY
          I mean, it's not true, is it?

     Zeke stares at his son.

                    ZEKE
          You got the balls to ask me that?

     Quincy can't hold his father's look.  Zeke shakes his head,
     hurt.

                    QUINCY
          Sorry.

                    ZEKE
          No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say
          it.  It's not true.

     Quincy looks in his father's eyes, knows he's telling the
     truth.

                    QUINCY
          So what are you gonna do?

                    ZEKE
          I want this thing to go to court, but my
          lawyer's telling me to settle.

                    QUINCY
          Why?

                    ZEKE
          A case like this could hang around for
          months and I'm up for this player
          relations job with the "Clips."  This
          gets out, false or not, no one'll touch
          me.

                    QUINCY
          What's Mom think?

                    ZEKE
          We haven't exactly been living the fairy-
          tale life the past few years.  Something
          like this happens, it either brings a
          family closer or pushes them further
          apart.  We'll just have to see how it
          plays out.
               (then)
          I'm giving her some space, couple
          days...

     Just then, a COLLEGE STUDENT approaches.

                    COLLEGE STUDENT
          Yo, Q-man, great game.

                    QUINCY
          Thanks.

     The student holds out a piece of paper, without even a glance
     to Zeke.

                    COLLEGE STUDENT
          Can I get an autograph?

     Quincy nods, signs the guy's paper.  Zeke watches his son,
     the rising star.

     EXT. MCCALL HOUSE - NIGHT

     Through the windows, we see Quincy enter the house.  He
     glances around, then walks to the living room.  He sees his
     mom sitting outside by the pool, drink in hand, looking torn
     up.  He pulls open the sliding glass door.  Nona jumps, then
     sees Quincy.  She quickly puts her drink down.

                    NONA
          You scared me.

                    QUINCY
          Sorry.  You okay?

                    NONA
          I'm fine.

     Quincy glances at her half-hidden glass.

                    QUINCY
          Last time I remember you drinking was
          when Marvin Gaye died.

     No response from Nona.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          This about Dad?

                    NONA
          Guess he talked to you.

                    QUINCY
          Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later
          the truth'll come out.

                    NONA
               (beat)
          Whose truth are you talking about?

                    QUINCY
          Mom, we can't let something like this
          mess up the family.

     She doesn't respond.  Quincy studies her.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          I mean, you believe him, right?

     Nona sits silent, humiliated.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          Mom?

                    NONA
          Just...leave it alone.

                    QUINCY
          This is just about money, you know that.

                    NONA
          Quincy, please...

                    QUINCY
          I mean, how many times have you told me
          yourself to watch out for these ho's?

                    NONA
          Guess I should have been telling your
          father.

                    QUINCY
          So you're gonna take the word of some
          trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.

     Nona grabs an envelope beside her and throws it at him.

     Confused, Quincy opens it.  HE PULLS OUT A COUPLE OF PHOTOS:

     Zeke outside a party.  IN ONE PHOTO, his arm is around a
     young woman.  IN ANOTHER PHOTO, they KISS.  AND YET ANOTHER,
     they climb into his car.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          What...what's this?

                    NONA
          I hired somebody.  How pathetic is that?
          After all his late nights and "meetings"
          and I still needed proof.

     Quincy just stares at the photos.

                    NONA (cont'd)
          I used to think I was lucky just to be
          married to Zeke McCall, but I'm too
          tired.

     Quincy looks stricken, but he moves to Nona, comforts her as
     she cries...
     
     
       EXT. TRACK - NIGHT



     Monica sits with a devastated Quincy, high up in the
     bleachers.  In the distance, the clock-tower glows 10:50.

                    QUINCY
          Don't put your hands in your pockets,
          hold your head up, always look a man in
          the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on
          his every word like he's God or
          something...

                    MONICA
          I know he messed up, but that doesn't
          change what he's been to you.

                    QUINCY
          What has he been to me?  I mean, he
          looked me in my face and lied like it was
          nothing.  Like it was easy.
               (then)
          And I'm standing there getting loud on my
          mom like she's the one with no sense...

                    MONICA
          She understands.

                    QUINCY
          He even had me wanting to play for the
          "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.

                    MONICA
          You're not stupid.

                    QUINCY
          I know a lot of brothers dog their wives,
          I just never thought my pops would do
          some shit like this...

     Monica puts her arms around him.  They sit there, quiet.
     Monica glances up at the clock tower.  She reacts.  Quincy
     notices.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          What?

                    MONICA
          Nothing.
               (beat)
          Why don't we walk to my dorm?

                    QUINCY
          I'm not up for running into anybody.
          Let's just kick it here, alright?

                    MONICA
          I...can't.

                    QUINCY
          Why not?

                    MONICA
          Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew.
          If I'm late, I don't suit up.

     Quincy looks at her, almost in shock.

                    QUINCY
          Didn't realize you were watching the
          clock.

                    MONICA
          I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.

                    QUINCY
          Nah.  Don't sweat it.

                    MONICA
          Quincy...

                    QUINCY
          For real.  I should be alone, anyway.

     Monica reluctantly stands.

                    MONICA
          Will you call me when you get in?

     Quincy nods.  Monica gives him a kiss.  Then she turns and
     crosses away.

     INT. MONICA/SHAYLA'S DORM - NIGHT

     The lights are off but Monica sits up in bed.  SHE WEARS
     BOXERS AND ONE OF QUINCY'S PRACTICE SHIRTS.

     Shayla lies under her covers across the room.

                    MONICA
          I shouldn't have left.

                    SHAYLA
          Go to sleep.

                    MONICA
          You should have seen him, Shay...

                    SHAYLA
          Mon, Sidra's out for one game, and you
          got the start.  But you get caught
          breaking curfew and Coach is gonna send
          your ass back to the bench.  You'll see
          your man tomorrow.

     Shayla's warning slowly sinks in.  Finally, Monica lays down.

                                           DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. TRACK - NIGHT

     The clock tower glows 12:30.  Quincy still sits in the
     bleachers.  Alone.  Tears fill his eyes as his world comes
     crashing down...

                                           DISSOLVE TO:
                                        
                                        
       INT. CAMPUS GYM - LATE DAY



     USC vs. Louisiana Tech.  The packed crowd is hyped.  Nathan

     sits by himself in the stands, excited.



     Monica sits on the bench with four of her teammates.  The
     rest of the team is lined up in front of them, including
     Sidra in street clothes.

                    ANNOUNCER
          And now the starting line-up for your
          Women of Troy!  At center, a senior, Toni
          Noise!

     Toni rises, jogs through the line of teammates to the court.

                    ANNOUNCER (cont'd)
          At forward, a senior, Lisa Mason!

     Lisa stands, skips through the line.

                    ANNOUNCER (cont'd)
          At forward, a junior, Zvette Mitchell!

     Zvette jumps up, bumps into each teammate as she moves down
     the line.

                    ANNOUNCER (cont'd)
          At guard, a freshman, Monica Wright!

     Monica takes a deep breath, then jogs through the line.  She
     gets to the middle of the floor and looks around with her
     game face on.

                    ANNOUNCER (cont'd)
          And at guard, a sophomore, Sandra Perez!

     Sandra jogs out and the rest of the team follows.  Everyone
     gathers in a tight circle with their arms around each other.

                    TONI
          Look y'all, we got all these people here
          to see big-bad, La Tech.  We need to let
          them know that this is our house.  So
          everybody better leave everything out on
          that floor, you got that?  Ready?  One,
          two, three....

                    TEAM
          Team!

                                          SMASH CUT TO:

     INT. SPORTS ARENA - LATE DAY

     A sellout crowd for the men's SC/Temple game.  And Quincy is
     having the worst game of his life.

     He drives down court on a fast break.  He ignores his two
     open teammates and puts up a three-pointer.  It hits nothing
     but air.  The crowd boos.

     Humiliated, Quincy tries to steal the ball back and commits a
     stupid foul.  His teammates glare at him as they line up for
     free throws.

     INT. CAMPUS GYM - CONTINUOUS

     Monica's game.  Late second half.  SC down two.

     Monica drives the lane, drawing two defenders.  She looks
     like she's about to force up a shot, then suddenly whips up a
     pass to a wide-open Sandra at the three-point line.  Nothing
     but net.  SC up one.

     Coach Miller claps intensely on the sideline.

                    COACH MILLER
          That's it, that's it!

     Ten seconds left.  Game on the line.  Monica tries to lob a
     pass inside to Toni.  The pass is knocked away and grabbed up
     by the opposing point guard.

     It is a one-on-one between Monica and the guard.  The girl
     drives hard for the winning hoop.  Monica races to the key
     and slides in front of her.  The guard goes up and slams into
     Monica.  Both crash to the floor as the ball drops through
     the net and the buzzer goes off.

     A WHISTLE.  The two women stare up at the REFEREE from the
     floor.  And then --

                    REFEREE
          Offensive foul!  Charging!  No basket!

     Monica leaps up as the crowd goes crazy.  Toni grabs up
     Monica in a hug as their teammates celebrate around them.

     INT. SPORTS ARENA - CONTINUOUS

     Quincy drags himself to his bench, slumps down dejectedly, as
     the Temple Owls celebrate their win around him.

     INT. LOCKER ROOM - DUSK

     The female players continue to celebrate as they undress.

                    MAEYEN
          Shoot, you see that crowd?  We need to be
          playing in the Sports Arena.

                    KELLI
          Hell yeah.

     They give each other a pound.

     Lisa looks at Monica, standing in her shorts and sports bra.

                    LISA
          Oh damn, Mon.

                    MONICA
          What?

                    LISA
          I think ol' girl took out your chi-chis
          with that charge.

     The women break into laughter.  Monica smiles.

                    MONICA
          Kiss my ass.

                    SANDRA
          Nah, I think she took that too.

                    MONICA
          Sandra, please, last time you chest-
          bumped me, it took you three tries.

     More laughter.  Monica looks over at Toni, sitting quietly at
     the bench.

                    MONICA (cont'd)
          Yo, T, why you so quiet?

                    TONI
               (beat)
          I don't want to go play overseas.

                    DORA
          I thought you were hyped about going to
          Portugal next year.

                    TONI
          It's never gonna be like this.  Playing
          in front of my family, hanging out with
          my girls.  Probably not even a
          McDonald's.

                    SANDRA
          Nah, there's always a McDonald's.

                    SIDRA
          Least you got an offer.  My agent's
          still looking.

                    CREE
               (to Lisa)
          What about you?

                    LISA
               (beat)
          Maybe it'd be worth it if I knew some day
          I could come back here and play.  But for
          right now, it's law school.

                    COACH MILLER (O.S.)
          Monica.

     Monica turns, sees Coach Miller standing in her office
     doorway.  She motions for her.  Monica heads over.  Sidra
     watches.

     INT. COACH MILLER'S OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER

     Trophies, plaques and photos fill every empty space.

     Coach Miller sits behind her desk.  Monica stands before her.

                    COACH MILLER
          You could've given up after you threw
          that ball away.  But you kept your head
          and you showed real heart.

                    MONICA
          Thanks.

                    COACH MILLER
          We've got our final games against Oregon
          and Oregon State and I want to shake
          things up a bit, so I'm starting you at
          point again.

                    MONICA
               (confused)
          I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next
          game.

                    COACH MILLER
          You want the job or not?

     Realization finally hits.

                    MONICA
          Yeah.  Yes.

     Monica looks at Coach Miller completely thrown.

                    COACH MILLER
          What?

                    MONICA
          It's just...it seems like you're always
          yelling at me.

                    COACH MILLER
          You think I'd go hoarse for a player with
          no potential?   When I ignore you, that's
          when you worry.
               (then)
          Go get dressed.

     Monica nods, crosses out.

     INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     As Monica walks back to her teammates, Coach Miller steps
     into the doorway.

                    COACH MILLER
          Sidra.

     Sidra looks at Monica as she rises, crosses over.  Monica
     avoids her eyes as they pass.  Sidra enters the office and
     the door closes.

                    SHAYLA
          Yo sis, what's going on?

     Beat, then Monica smiles.

                                          SMASH CUT TO:
                                        
                                        
       INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT



     Black folks pack the cramped houseparty, bumping to a phat

     hip hop joint.



     Monica bounces through the throng.  A GIRL grabs her arm.

                    GIRL'S VOICE
          Yo, great game.

                    MONICA
          Thanks.

     Another PARTY-GOER grabs her arm.

                    PARTY-GOER
          Girl, you can play.

     Monica smiles wider.  She spots Reggie dancing in the crowd,
     moves to him.

                    MONICA
          Reg.  You seen Quincy?

                    REGGIE
          What's up, girl.

                    MONICA
               (louder)
          Derek said Q was here.

                    REGGIE
          We'll roll through.

     Monica is suddenly pulled into a dance routine by Sandra and
     Lisa.

     She laughs, tires to move away, but they won't let her go.
     Monica gives in, grooves with them.

     ANGLE ON:

     Quincy walks through the door with a half-empty forty in his
     hand.  Girls immediately try to grab his attention from the
     dance floor, or stare him down from the sidelines.

     Quincy sees Monica on the dance floor.  He stands, watching
     her.  Takes a drink.  Monica finally looks over, sees him.
     She smiles, crosses to him.

                    MONICA
          Hey.

                    QUINCY
          What's up?

                    MONICA
          I've been trying to find you all day.

                    QUINCY
          Here I am.

     She glances at the forty in his hand.

                    MONICA
          Sorry about your game.

                    QUINCY
          It happens, right...

     Shayla suddenly grabs Monica from behind.

                    SHAYLA
               (to Monica)
          What's up, superstar.
               (then, to Quincy)
          Your girl was on tonight.  She tell you?

                    QUINCY
               (beat)
          I heard.

                    SHAYLA
          She also tell you she ganked the starting
          spot from Sidra?

     Monica looks at him for a reaction.

                    QUINCY
          Nah.

     He downs the last of his forty.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          Where's the keg at?

                    SHAYLA
          Balcony.

     He heads for the glass doors.  Monica and Shayla follow.

     EXT. BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

     Reggie approaches the group.  Gives Quincy a nod.

                    REGGIE
          What's up, dog?
               (to Shayla)
          Hey, flyness.

                    SHAYLA
          Get off the bra strap, Reggie, you're a
          ho.

     He laughs, then turns back to Quincy.

                    REGGIE
          Coach is gonna kill us in practice
          tomorrow.  Might even pull his lips off
          your dick, limp as your game was tonight.

     Quincy just looks at him.

                    QUINCY
          That's funny.

     Monica leans against Quincy, affectionately.

                    MONICA
          he's just playing, Q...

                    QUINCY
          You think for once we could talk about
          something besides basketball?

                    SHAYLA
          Sure.

                    REGGIE
          Whatever's clever.

     Silence.  Reggie and Shayla crack up.  Quincy shakes his
     head, moves to the keg line.

                    MONICA
          Y'all need to quit.

     She starts for Quincy

                    SIDRA (O.S.)
          Monica.

     Monica looks over, sees Sidra standing in the doorway.  There
     is no escaping this confrontation.  She glances at Quincy,
     then crosses over.  Quincy turns, sees her disappear back
     inside.

     INT. HOUSEPARTY - CONTINUOUS

                    MONICA
          What's up?

                    SIDRA
          Just wanted to say good game.

                    MONICA
          But?

                    SIDRA
          No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take
          that charge.

                    MONICA
          Thanks.

                    SIDRA
          But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni.
          Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.

     Monica shakes her head.  An awkward silence.

                    SIDRA (cont'd)
          I'd be lying if I said I wasn't pissed.

                    MONICA
          I know.

                    SIDRA
          Just one word of advice for next season.

                    MONICA
          What's that?

                    SIDRA
          Never let a freshman take your spot.

     Sidra turns and walks away.

     EXT. BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

     Quincy takes one long drink from his cup.  KERRY, 20, and
     spandexed, stands directly in front of him, flirtatiously.

                    KERRY
          Excuse me.

                    QUINCY
          Excuse me.

     He steps aside as she tries to work the keg.  Nothing comes
     out.  She nods at his cup, smiles.

                    KERRY
          If that's the last beer, you and I are
          sharing.

     Shayla glances over as Quincy pumps the keg a couple of
     times.  Kerry hands him her cup and he starts filling it up.

                    KERRY (cont'd)
          I like watching you play.  Number twenty-
          two.

                    QUINCY
          Guess you didn't see the game.

     Quincy knows he should blow her off, but he's digging the
     attention.  He hands her back her cup.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          What's your name?

                    KERRY
          Kerry.

                    QUINCY
          Q.

                    KERRY
          I know.

     ANGLE ON

     Monica looks over at Quincy and sees him talking to the
     hoochie.  The girl looks too damn comfortable.  Monica moves
     back outside.

                    KERRY (cont'd)
          I'll see you.  Q-man.

     She swishes past Monica.  Shayla "accidentally" bumps her.
     Kerry glares.

                    MONICA
          Who was that?

                    QUINCY
          Nobody.

                    MONICA
          Who's nobody?

                    QUINCY
          Look, this party's whack.  You ready to
          go?

                    MONICA
          You want to go talk?

                    QUINCY
          Not really.

     He leans in, kisses her drunkenly.  She pulls away.

                    MONICA
          We could finish what we were talking
          about last night.

     Quincy kisses her again.

                    MONICA (cont'd)
          Q...
               (pushing him off)
          Quincy, quit.  You're drunk.

     They fall silent.

                    QUINCY
          You know what, I'm just gonna crash.

                    MONICA
               (agitated)
          Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.

                    QUINCY
          Nah.  I have curfew.

     He starts to walk away, then stops.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          Oh, by the way.  Congratulations.

     He goes.  Monica stares after him.
     
     
       INT. QUINCY/REGGIE'S SUITE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

     Quincy pushes through his front door, then stops short in his
     doorway.  Zeke sits on the couch.

                    QUINCY
          What are you doing here?

                    ZEKE
          Your door was unlocked.

                    QUINCY
          Still is, so let yourself out.

                    ZEKE
          We need to talk.

                    QUINCY
          We ain't got nothing to talk about.

                    ZEKE
          I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I
          ain't that kid's father.

                    QUINCY
          Lucky kid.

                    ZEKE
          Look, I ain't saying it was right, but
          sometimes things happen.

                    QUINCY
          And some things should never fucking
          happen!

                    ZEKE
          Boy, you're so perfect you can look down
          on me?

                    QUINCY
          I ain't a damn liar.

                    ZEKE
          Your mom was real quick to show you those
          pictures, wasn't she?
          Well, she was nineteen when she got
          pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're
          the best thing in my life, but she knew I
          wasn't ready for no marriage.

                    QUINCY
          So now you're saying my mother trapped
          you?

                    ZEKE
          I'm saying I handled my responsibilities
          like a man.  But when you're in the NBA,
          you pull into a city and there's a
          hundred women waiting at the hotel.  And
          another twenty that made it past security
          on your floor.  And the boldest one is
          standing right at your door.  And after
          awhile, it just becomes part of the game.
               (then)
          I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't
          have.  But I did it cause I love you.

     Zeke looks at his son, meaning every word.  Quincy stares
     back, long and hard.

                    QUINCY
          Since we're being honest, guess I should
          tell you.  I'm dropping out of school and
          going pro.

                    ZEKE
          What?

     Quincy just stares back.

                    ZEKE (cont'd)
          Quincy, you'd be making the biggest
          mistake of your life.

                    QUINCY
               (sarcastic)
          From your mouth.

                    ZEKE
               (desperate)
          I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't
          let you do this.

                    QUINCY
          Always thought "can't" wasn't in a man's
          vocabulary.

     Zeke is taken aback by the hatred in his son's eyes.  He
     turns and without another word, exits.

     EXT. STREET - LATE NIGHT

     Quincy stands across the street from the houseparty, staring
     up at the balcony.  Monica leans against the railing,
     laughing with a couple of teammates.  Quincy watches her,
     then turns and walks away...

                                           DISSOLVE TO:
                                        
                                        
       EXT. CAMPUS GYM - LATE DAY



     SLOW MOTION.  Monica's eyes are on fire as she races an

     Oregon player for a loose ball.  Both dive for it, slide

     across the floor.  Monica grabs it up, screams for a time-out
     as her opponent tries to wrestle away the ball...

     EXT. QUINCY/REGGIE'S SUITE - DUSK

     Monica walks down the hall to Quincy's suite.  The window is
     open.  The sounds of Nintendo are heard.  She walks in
     without knocking.

     INT. QUINCY/REGGIE'S SUITE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Reggie sits on the couch with a TEAMMATE, playing Nintendo's
     "Duck Hunt".

                    MONICA
          Hey, y'all.

     They barely give her a nod.  Monica crosses into

     INT. QUINCY/REGGIE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Quincy stands at an ironing board, ironing a T-shirt.

                    MONICA
          Hey.

                    QUINCY
          Hey, what's up.

                    MONICA
          You weren't at my game.

                    QUINCY
          Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this
          meeting with this guy.

     Quincy pulls on the T-shirt.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          You win?

                    MONICA
          Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.

                    QUINCY
          The "man" again.

                    MONICA
               (smiles)
          Woman...

     A knock at the front door.  Quincy exits.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Monica follows, then stops short.  Kerry, the spandexed girl
     from the party, stands in the doorway.

                    QUINCY
          Hey, you.

                    KERRY
          Hi.

     Quincy gives her a hug.  Monica stares at him in disbelief.
     Reggie and his teammate smack each other, "Oh shit!"

                    QUINCY
          Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica,
          Kerry.

                    MONICA
          What the hell's going on?

                    QUINCY
          We're going to get some food.

                    MONICA
          Are you out of your mind?

                    KERRY
          Maybe I should come back?

                    MONICA
          No.  You stay, I'll leave.

     She storms out.

     EXT. WRIGHT HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DUSK

     BAM!  Monica slams her car door.  Her face is a mask of anger
     and confusion.

     Camille exits the house, car keys in hand.  She sees her.

                    CAMILLE
          Monica.  What are you doing here?

                    MONICA
          Didn't know I needed a reason to come
          home.

                    CAMILLE
          Don't be defensive.  I'm just surprised
          to see you.

                    MONICA
          Dad around?

                    CAMILLE
          He's still at the bank.

     Monica glowers.  Camille looks at her.

                    CAMILLE (cont'd)
          Everything okay?

                    MONICA
               (clearly not)
          Yeah.

     Camille just nods, doesn't bother asking again.

                    CAMILLE
          Well, I'm going to get dinner.

     She pulls open her car door.  Beat, then...

                    CAMILLE (cont'd)
          It's just a game.

                    MONICA
          What?

                    CAMILLE
          Whenever you lose, you get this attitude.
          But it's just a game.

     Monica rolls her eyes, as her mom leaves.

     EXT. DORMS - NIGHT

     Quincy sits on the wall outside of Monica's dorm, as Monica
     slowly makes her way up the walk.  She sees him, stops.

                    QUINCY
          Can we talk?

                    MONICA
          Talk to your new girlfriend.

                    QUINCY
          I just took the ho to Burger King,
          alright.

                    MONICA
          Cheap date.

                    QUINCY
          Least she had time for me.

                    MONICA
          So you fucked around to prove a point!

                    QUINCY
          I just said I didn't fuck around.  But
          you got your head so far up your ass it
          took a cheap date for you to notice me.

                    MONICA
          What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your
          ass like everybody else?

                    QUINCY
          You forgot to be there.

                    MONICA
          That night you wanted to talk about your
          Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed
          to do?

                    QUINCY
          Stay!

                    MONICA
          If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!

                    QUINCY
          Least you got your priorities straight.

                    MONICA
          I never asked you to choose.

                    QUINCY
          Never had to.

                    MONICA
          I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what
          that means it should be you.

                    QUINCY
          Well, if all you care about is
          basketball, why you fucking me?  Go fuck
          Dick Vitale.

     Monica punches the shit out of Quincy, then pushes past him.
     Quincy grabs her arm, stopping her.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          Hold up.  I'm sorry, alright.

     They stand, silent.  Trying to come down from their anger.

                    MONICA
          How do I know next time you're feeling
          neglected or whatever, you're not going
          to run around on me?  If we're going to
          be together I have to be able to trust
          you.

                    QUINCY
          I'm not asking for us to be together.

     Monica flinches in shock.

                    MONICA
          What?

                    QUINCY
          I'm going through a lot of shit right
          now, more than you have time for.

                    MONICA
          How are you going to tell me what I have
          time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we
          can fix this.

                    QUINCY
          I don't think so.

                    MONICA
          You don't think so?

                    QUINCY
          Look, I'm entering the draft.

                    MONICA
          You're what?

                    QUINCY
          I decided to go pro.  And who knows where
          I'll end up, you know?

     Monica's heart is sinking fast.

                    MONICA
          When did you decide all this?

                    QUINCY
          Few days ago.

                    MONICA
          So that's it, just forget about us?

                    QUINCY
          Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us
          anymore, it's about me.

     Monica is crushed.  Beat as, Quincy struggles to stay cold.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          But, you know, I'd still like us to be
          friends.

                    MONICA
          Friends.

     She fights back tears.  Quincy has to look away.  Monica
     can't respond.

                    QUINCY
          So...I guess I'll see you around.

                    MONICA
          Uh huh.

     Beat, then Quincy turns and walks away.  Monica tries to
     fight her tears but her pain, hurt and confusion are too
     much.  Finally, she gives in, and the tears fall.

                                         FADE TO BLACK.

     FOOTAGE.  Press conference.  Magic sits beside his wife
     Cookie.  He shocks the world as he announces his retirement
     from basketball.
     
       FADE IN:



     TITLE CARD: "FOURTH QUARTER" then "1993"



     ESTABLISHING SHOTS OF SPAIN



     Madrid, Pampolona, the running of the bulls, old-world
     architecture.

     Finally, we rest on a large billboard, a photo of Monica in a
     basketball uniform, drinking a Spanish soft-drink.

     EXT. STREETS OF SPAIN - LATE DAY

     Monica jogs down the congested cobble-stone street, a sports
     bag over her shoulder.  She is TWENTY-THREE.  Half-assed
     braids frame her matured features.

     She passes store fronts, street vendors, and dodges
     pedestrians, as she makes her way toward a large, older
     arena.

     EXT. ARENA - CONTINUOUS

     An excited crowd jockeys for position at the front doors.
     Above them, a huge banner reads "Campeonato de Europeo".
     (European Championships".)

     As Monica heads for the back entrance, a cheer goes up from a
     large contingent in the crowd.  Monica smiles, waves back.
     TWO LITTLE GIRLS break from line, run to her.

                    LITTLE GIRLS
          Baloncesto!  Balencesto!  (Basketball!
          Basketball!)

                    MONICA
          Oye.

     They giggle, hold out a piece of paper and a pencil.

                    LITTLE GIRLS
          Autografo.

     As Monica signs her autograph, a tall woman carrying a
     matching sports bag approaches.  She is LUISA, Spanish, 33.

                    LUISA
               (thick Spanish accent)
          Monica.  What is up?

                    MONICA
          Oye, Luisa.

     Monica hands the girls her autograph and they run off.

                    LUISA
          Large game, no?

                    MONICA
          Si.  Large game.

     They duck into the arena.

     INT. ARENA - LOCKER ROOM - LATE DAY

     Paint peels off the walls.  Windows are broken overhead.

     Monica sits alone at her locker, taping her own ankles.  Her
     TEN TEAMMATES, all from Spain, sit on the surrounding
     benches, talking and joking among themselves in Spanish.
     Monica is clearly an outsider.

     COACH PARRA, Spanish, late 40's, enters.

                    COACH PARRA
          Silenco!

     The women immediately stop talking.  COACH PARRA gives an
     animated, impassioned speech in Spanish.  Monica doesn't
     understand a word, just continues taping her ankles.

     Coach Parra finishes and the women clap, pumped up. Monica
     turns to Luisa, seated next to her on the bench.

                    MONICA
          What did he say?

                    LUISA
          He say to give the ball to you.

     INT. ARENA - NIGHT

     The arena is PACKED with a raucous European crowd, chanting
     and waving signs - the love their women's basketball.

     Monica walks onto the floor, tucking her jersey into her
     shorts.  The uniforms are old-style - polyester and tight.
     Her club's name is stitched on the front, "GODELLA".

     As she hits center court, a smile suddenly breaks through her
     game face.  Standing opposite her, playing for the opposing
     Italian club is Sidra, HER RIVAL FROM USC.

                    SIDRA
          Well, what do you know.

                    MONICA
          What's up, Sidra.

                    SIDRA
          I'm gonna love winning this championship
          in your house.

                    MONICA
          How do you say "you're dreaming" in
          Italian?

     They move into position.  The ball is tossed up.  Italy winds
     the tip and the ball is passed to Sidra.

     Monica hounds her as she brings up the ball.  Sidra shoves
     her off and to the floor, and scores.  No whistle.  Women's
     pro ball is at a whole other level.  Bigger, better, tougher.

     The ball is passed in to Monica.  She drives down court, goes
     up for a lay up.  An Italian player shoves Monica in mid-air,
     taking out her legs.  Monica crashes on the hardwood.

     A whistle.  Monica lays still for a moment, then pushes
     herself up and walks to the free-throw line without a word.
     Without emotion.

     INT. SPAIN - NIGHTCLUB - LATE NIGHT

     A huge crowd dances fervently to the live Spanish music.  In
     the middle of the floor, the Spanish players are the life of
     the party.

     In a corner, Monica sits with Sidra, drinking and watching
     the festivities.  A large trophy sits on the table.

                    SIDRA
          Can you take that damn thing off the
          table.

                    MONICA
          You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.

     Monica sets it down in the seat next to her, puts an arm
     around it.  Sidra shakes her head.

                    SIDRA
          Still a cocky bitch.

     Monica laughs.  She downs her drink, motions to the waiter.

                    MONICA
          Uno mas, por favor.

     The waiter nods.

                    MONICA (cont'd)
          Last I heard, you were playing in Sweden.

                    SIDRA
          Yeah, four years ago.  They had me
          staying in this tiny-ass town with like
          fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was
          about a thousand goats running around,
          and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then
          the whack club I'm on loses three games
          in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire
          me.

                    MONICA
          Just like that?

                    SIDRA
          Yup.  So I've been playing with this
          Italian club the last three years.

                    MONICA
          How's that been?

                    SIDRA
          It's better.  Even though the whole first
          season my teammates didn't pass to me
          cause they were mad "The American" was
          making more money.
               (smiles)
          I led the team in rebounds cause it was
          the only way I could touch the damn ball.

     Monica laughs as the waiter brings her drink.  She tries to
     pay, but he just shakes his head, crosses away.

                    SIDRA (cont'd)
          Most of us don't win championships our
          first year overseas.

                    MONICA
          Please, I went through the same drama as
          everybody else.  I mean, the first four
          months, only person I could talk to was
          this chick Luisa, who knew like ten words
          of English from watching old "Dif'rent
          Strokes" reruns.  Swear to God, I had to
          tell her if she said, "What you talking
          bout, Willis?" one more time, I was
          gonna kick her ass.

     Sidra laughs.  They watch the madness out on the dance floor.

                    SIDRA
          So what are these Spanish guys like?

                    MONICA
          I wouldn't know.

                    SIDRA
          What?  You've been over here seven months
          and you ain't tapped anything?

                    MONICA
          Just not my type, I guess.

                    SIDRA
          Shoot, Italian boys love them some black
          women.  They can't get enough of me.

     Monica smiles.

                    MONICA
          You ever think about going back?

                    SIDRA
          Sometimes.  But what's the alternative,
          not playing?  You remember big Toni?
               (off Monica's nod)
          She quit last year, now she's working at
          some bookstore.  I mean, look at us.
          They treat us like we're Hollywood stars
          over here.  We just played in the
          championship game.  It doesn't get much
          sweeter than this.

     Monica takes this in.  Her eyes do not reflect someone on top
     of the world.  She takes a long drink.

     INT. SPAIN - MONICA'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

     A small, sparse, one-bedroom.  Sam, Diane and the rest of the
     gang from "Cheers" fill the small TV screen that flickers in
     the darkness.  Their dialogue is dubbed in Spanish.

     Monica sits on the floor, braiding her hair.

     SHE WEARS BOXERS AND QUINCY'S OLD PRACTICE SHIRT.  AFTER FIVE
     YEARS, IT IS WELL-WORN.

     Feelings of loneliness threaten to swallow her whole.  She
     looks out her window and sees her billboard, looming in the
     distance.  She just stares.
     
     
       INT. LOS ANGELES FORUM - NIGHT



     The crowd erupts as a Laker player dunks the ball on a fast

     break.



     ANGLE ON



     Laker announcers CHICK HEARN and STU LANTZ.



                    CHICK HEARN

          Stu, this game is in the refrigerator.
          The door is closed, the lights are out,
          the butter's hard and the Jell-Oooooo's
          jigglin'.

                    STU LANTZ
          And here come the subs.

     ANGLE ON

     Quincy pulls off his sweats and jogs onto the court with the
     rest of the subs.  He is twenty-three, a man.  His goatee and
     tired eyes make him look older.  HE NOW WEARS NUMBER TWENTY-
     ONE.

                    STU LANTZ (cont'd) (V.O.)
          It's good to see these guys get a little
          playing time.  And the fans love it.

     Quincy immediately gets a pass in the corner.  He puts up a
     quick three and it banks hard off the rim.

     ANGLE ON

     Chick and Stu.

                    CHICK HEARN
          Three-pointer is off for the kid from
          SC.  Came out after his freshman year,
          now in his fifth year with the league.

                    STU LANTZ
          The son of Zeke McCall, played twelve
          years with the Clippers.

                    CHICK HEARN
               (nods)
          Pretty good player.  The kid's moved
          around quite a bit, but he's hoping to
          finally have a home with the Lakers.

     ANGLE ON

     Quincy steals the ball, has nothing but open court ahead of
     him.

                    CHICK HEARN (cont'd) (V.O.)
          Watch out, folks, it's showtime.

     Quincy takes off from the hash-mark and throws down a monster
     jam.  He swings high off the rim.  Too high.  His hand slips
     and he crashes to the floor.  His knee twists at a sickening
     angle.

     The dwindling crowd gasps as Quincy clutches his left knee,
     writhing in pain.

     INT. DANIEL FREEMAN HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT

     Zeke walks down the corridor, checking room numbers.  He is
     forty-five now.  His slight paunch as become a roll.

     He sees Nona exiting a room, with an empty water pitcher in
     hand.  Her hair is in locks.

                    ZEKE
          Nona.

     Nona looks over.  Her eyes narrow.

                    ZEKE (cont'd)
          How's he doing?

                    NONA
          Not great.

                    ZEKE
          What's that, not great?

                    NONA
          The doctor'll be back in a minute.

                    ZEKE
          Nona, please.

                    NONA
          He tore his ACL.

     Zeke's shoulders slump.  Then he looks back at her.

                    ZEKE
          Almost didn't recognize you with your
          hair like that.  How you been?

                    NONA
          Happy.  And he won't want to see you.

     Nona walks over to a MAN standing nearby.  He puts an arm
     around her and they move down the hall.  Zeke watches for a
     beat, then pulls open Quincy's door, steps inside.

     INT. QUINCY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Quincy lays in the bed.  His knee is bandaged and propped up
     by pillows.  He stares out the window.

                    ZEKE
          Hey, son.

     Quincy turns, sees his father.  He turns back to the window.

                    ZEKE (cont'd)
          Well, you made SportsCenter.

                    QUINCY
          What do you want?

                    ZEKE
          Came by to check on you.

                    QUINCY
          After five years.

                    ZEKE
          Don't remember that being my fault.
          Seems like you divorced me same time as
          your mom.

                    QUINCY
          Look, I'm busy.

                    ZEKE
          I can see that.  I know things look
          pretty bleak right now, but you can't get
          down on yourself.

                    QUINCY
          I stopped taking your advice a long time
          ago, or did you forget?

                    ZEKE
          No.

                    QUINCY
          Good.

                    ZEKE
          Quincy.  I know you left school early to
          throw your middle finger up at me.

                    QUINCY
          And now I'm paying for it, right?  That
          what this is about?  "I told you so?"

                    ZEKE
          You want me to fuck off?

                    QUINCY
          Yeah.

                    ZEKE
          Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say
          something.

     Silence.  Then.

                    ZEKE (cont'd)
          You're a better ballplayer than I ever
          was.  But you got a lot of other things
          going for you.  You're smart.  I always
          felt...I always knew that you could do
          anything you wanted.  You want to be a
          ballplayer, be a ballplayer.  Just know
          you ain't like everybody else on that
          court.  You ain't like I was.  You got
          options.  That's all I ever tried to show
          you.

                    QUINCY
          You're still trying to tell me what I
          should and shouldn't do.  How come you
          couldn't be the man you kept trying to
          make me?

     Zeke stares at his son, wishing he could satisfy him with an
     answer.

                    ZEKE
          I just couldn't

     With nothing left to say, Zeke pulls open the door and
     leaves.  Quincy stares at the door long after it closes.

                                           DISSOLVE TO:
                                        
                                        
       INT. QUINCY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY



     A NURSE enters, carrying a bouquet of flowers.  She moves

     past the empty bed, puts them on a table already overflowing

     with flowers.  She pulls open the blinds and light floods the
     room.  She crosses back out.

     A toilet flush.  Beat, then Quincy slowly hops out of the
     bathroom, scratching his bare ass through the opening of his
     gown.

                    VOICE (O.S.)
          And I thought this was gonna be awkward.

     Quincy whips around and is shocked to see Monica standing
     there, laughing.  She has clearly made an effort with her
     appearance.

                    QUINCY
          Monica?

     He stumbles.  Monica quickly goes to him, catches his arm
     before he falls.

                    MONICA
          I'm sorry.

     Quincy stares at her, completely thrown.  It's been five
     years.  An awkward beat.

                    MONICA (cont'd)
          So, how you doing?

                    QUINCY
          Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.

                    MONICA
          I was.
               (smiling)
          I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.

     Quincy rubs his goatee self-consciously.

                    QUINCY
          Just something I'm trying.

                    MONICA
          No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.

                    QUINCY
          Thanks.

     Quincy tries to adjust his footing and flinches in pain.

                    MONICA
          Shouldn't you be lying down, or...

                    QUINCY
          I'm alright.  But you can sit.

                    MONICA
          I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.

                    QUINCY
          Yup.

                    MONICA
          What are the doctors saying?

                    QUINCY
               (shrugs)
          A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be
          back in six months.

                    MONICA
          I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.

                    QUINCY
          Not for Quincy McCall.

                    MONICA
          I forgot, "Q-man."

     An awkward beat.

                    QUINCY
          So, how's pro-ball, Europe?

                    MONICA
          We won the championship.

                    QUINCY
          Still working on being the first girl in
          the NBA?

                    MONICA
          Well, I tried sneaking in after college,
          but they found breasts during my
          physical.

                    QUINCY
          Funny.  I never did.

                    MONICA
          Kiss my ass.

     Monica cracks up.  Quincy laughs with her.

                    MONICA (cont'd)
          I can't believe it's been five years.

     Quincy nods.

                    QUINCY
          Tried calling you a couple times.

                    MONICA
          Oh yeah?

                    QUINCY
          Wanted to give you props on making First
          Team All-American.  And then when Magic
          retired, I tried calling you again.

                    MONICA
               (lying)
          Must have been my cheap-ass answering
          machine.  It was always messing up.

                    QUINCY
          Figured it was something like that.

     They look at each other.  The moment is building.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          So, when do you go back?

                    MONICA
          Actually, I don't...

                    QUINCY
          What do you mean?

                    MONICA
          I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking
          about giving it a rest for awhile.

                    QUINCY
               (completely thrown)
          A rest?

                    MONICA
          Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun
          anymore.  You know?

                    QUINCY
          No.

     He stares at her.  Into her.

                    FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
          Quincy!

     Quincy and Monica turn, as KYRA KESSLER, black, 26 and
     beautiful, rushes into the room.  She wears a flight
     attendant's uniform.  She goes to Quincy, gives him a kiss.
     Monica reacts.

                    KYRA
          I'm so sorry.  No one would switch
          flights with me.

                    QUINCY
          It's okay.

                    KYRA
          Why are you up?  Get in bed.

     She takes Quincy's arm, moves him to the bed.  Monica
     watches.

                    KYRA (cont'd)
          Tell me you're going to be okay.

                    QUINCY
          I'm gonna be okay.

     Kyra relaxes.  Then she glances over at Monica.

                    KYRA
          Hello.

                    QUINCY
          Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...

                    KYRA
               (recognizing)
          Monica.  You grew up together, right?
          Quincy's told me about you.

     Monica smiles awkwardly.

                    QUINCY
          This is Kyra.  My fiance.

     The shock hits too quick to cover.  But Monica tries.

                    MONICA
          Fiance.  Wow.  Congratulations.

                    KYRA
          Thank you.

                    MONICA
          I didn't know.  Wow.  That's great.
               (then)
          Well...I should go.

                    QUINCY
          It means a lot that you came by.

                    KYRA
          Yes, we appreciate that.

                    MONICA
          Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your
          knee, and everything.

                    QUINCY
          Thanks.

     Monica forces one last smile, pulls open the door and leaves.

     INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

     Monica walks down the hall, shell-shocked.
     
     
       INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATE DAY



     Camille moves between the counter and the stove, whipping up

     a couple pecan pies.  Monica enters.



                    MONICA

          Hey.



                    CAMILLE
          Hi.

                    MONICA
          Need any help?

                    CAMILLE
          I can manage.

     Monica nods and moves to the barstool.

                    CAMILLE (cont'd)
          Your sister's bringing the baby over.
          You should try to be here.

                    MONICA
          Yeah.  Can't wait to see him
               (she falls silent, then)
          I just saw Quincy.

                    CAMILLE
          How is he?

                    MONICA
          Engaged.

                    CAMILLE
          To that stewardess?

                    MONICA
          Yeah, you met her?

                    CAMILLE
          His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago.
          He could do a lot better if you ask me.

                    MONICA
          Maybe she is.

     Camille looks up, studies Monica for a moment.

                    CAMILLE
          I thought you were over him.

     Monica shrugs.

                    MONICA
          So what do I do?

                    CAMILLE
          Find out where they're registered and
          send them a gift.

                    MONICA
               (disgusted)
          Whatever.

                    CAMILLE
          You didn't want my opinion in the first
          place, so why even ask?

                    MONICA
          I asked but why does it always have to be
          so damn prissy.

                    CAMILLE
          Don't curse.

                    MONICA
          There you go.

                    CAMILLE
          What do you want me to tell you, Monica,
          to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex
          with him?  I'm not going to do that.
          Yes, I believe thinking of other people
          is important and yes I'd rather bake a
          pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that
          makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.

     Monica stares at her mother.  There's no going back.

                    MONICA
          So that's why we can't get along?
          Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump
          shot?

                    CAMILLE
          You're the one always turning your nose
          up at me.

                    MONICA
          No I don't.

                    CAMILLE
          Child, please.  Ever since you were
          little you thought you were too good for
          anything I had to say.

                    MONICA
          I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail
          polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray
          of your perfume.

                    CAMILLE
          What was so wrong with wanting to teach
          you the things I knew could help you?

                    MONICA
          Because you're pushing me to be something
          I'm not.

                    CAMILLE
          So you're angry with me because you're
          standing here with your hair combed and
          wearing perfume?

     Monica is busted.  It takes her a moment to come back.

                    MONICA
          I'm angry because I want a mother, not
          Martha Stewart.

                    CAMILLE
          Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete
          whose mother is nothing but a housewife.

                    MONICA
          That's not it.

                    CAMILLE
          Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that
          because I know.

     Monica stares at her mother.

                    MONICA
          I remember when I was eight years old,
          you spent like four hours cooking up this
          fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do
          was set the table.  And I guess you and
          Dad got your wires crossed or something
          because he walks in with a couple of
          pizzas.  And you didn't say anything.
          You just threw the whole meal into some
          tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.

                    CAMILLE
          I don't remember that.

                    MONICA
          I do.  You never stood up for yourself.
          Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because
          of that.

                    CAMILLE
          That's ridiculous.

                    MONICA
          What's ridiculous is not being a caterer
          so your husband can feel like a man
          knowing his woman's home cooking and
          ironing his drawers.

     WHAP!  Camille's humiliation is immediate and she cuts off
     Monica with a SLAP.  Camille curses herself for losing it.

                    CAMILLE
          Dammitt, Monica!

     Monica is stunned, hurt.

                    MONICA
          I'm sorry.

     Camille stares at her daughter, devastated.

                    CAMILLE
          Is that really all you think of me?

     Monica can't answer.

                    CAMILLE (cont'd)
          When I married your father, all I wanted
          was a nice house with a big kitchen so I
          could start my catering business.  And
          then I got pregnant with Lena, and then I
          got pregnant with you.  And I put it out
          of my mind because that's what you did.

     Monica stares at her mother.

                    CAMILLE (cont'd)
          But you want to know what day I remember?
          In high school, you getting ready for the
          Spring Dance.  I put my pearls around
          your neck, told you you were beautiful
          and you looked like you were going to
          cry.  That day I was happy I didn't have
          a catering business to run off to.  My
          family had three meals a day, had someone
          to pick up after them, and when my
          daughters went to a dance, I helped them
          get ready.  That's what I came to care
          about.

                    MONICA
               (softly)
          That's all you cared about.  I must have
          played in a thousand games and I can only
          remember you being to two.

                    CAMILLE
          You had your coaches and your father for
          that stuff.  It never mattered one way or
          the other if I went to your games.

                    MONICA
          It mattered, Mom.

     Camille looks at her daughter and is struck by the need in
     her eyes.  Monica moves off the barstool and leaves.
     
     
       INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - DAY



     The room looks exactly the same.  Trophies, medals, plaques.
     Basketball posters and her "strong women" wall.

     Monica sits on her bed, staring up at a photo of her and
     Quincy, tacked up to her bulletin board, amid other photos of
     her childhood.  THEY ARE EIGHTEEN, PLAYFULLY WRESTLING OVER A
     BASKETBALL.

     Monica slowly rises, starts taking her posters down.

     INT. REHAB CENTER - DAY

     Quincy sits on a leg extension machine, with his left leg
     tucked under the padded bar.  A TRAINER stands behind him.

     Sweat and pain coat Quincy's face and scarred knee as he
     slowly lifts the light weight again, and again, and again.

     INT. BANK - DAY

     A long line of customers shift impatiently during the noon-
     time rush.

     Monica sits with a BANK MANAGER at the "New Accounts" desk,
     learning the ropes.  Her hair is done, she wears a simple
     dress.  Behind her, hanging on the wall, are three framed
     photos of the bank presidents.  ONE OF THEM IS HER FATHER,
     NATHAN.

     INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Monica stands in her room, staring out at Quincy's window.
     She watches as Quincy and Kyra pack up some of Quincy's
     stuff.  Quincy tries to take his basketball globe light. She
     laughs, "Hell no."

     INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - DAY

     Camille enters, moves to Monica's garbage can, dumps the
     contents into her larger bag.  Suddenly, she stops.  She
     reaches into the garbage and pulls out a crumpled picture.

     Camille smooths it.  It is the photo of Monica and Quincy at
     eighteen, wrestling over a basketball.

     CAMILLE STARES AT IT, TAKEN IN BY THE PURE JOY IN HER
     DAUGHTER'S FACE.  She sits down on Monica's bed, still
     staring.

     INT. FORUM - DAY

     In the empty gym, Quincy jogs up and down the court.  He is
     still tentative on his knee, but he keeps jogging.

     And then, slowly, the determination melts from his face.  His
     jog turns into a walk, and then he just...stops.

     INT. MCCALL HOUSE - QUINCY'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Quincy stands in the middle of his room, taking in his life.
     Old, worn basketball posters still line the walls.  Trophies
     and awards.  USC memorabilia.  His basketball globe light.

     He walks to his window, looks out at Monica's window.  Her
     room is dark.

                                           DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. QUINCY'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - MORNING

     Quincy tilts his face up to the shower head and rinses the
     soap from his face.  He hears the bathroom door open.  He
     shuts off the water and opens the curtain.

     Kyra sits on the toilet, taking a pee.  Quincy slams the
     curtain closed.

                    QUINCY
          Damn, girl.

                    KYRA
          What?

                    QUINCY
          I don't wanna see that.

                    KYRA
          Get used to it, babe.

     She flushes.  Quincy steps out, grabs a towel.  A long scar
     runs across his knee cap.

                    QUINCY
          Brother's gonna have to start locking
          doors.

     Kyra laughs as she buttons up her flight attendant's uniform.
     They cross into:

     INT. QUINCY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Kyra packs up a suitcase.

                    QUINCY
          So how long is this trip?

                    KYRA
          Four days.

     Quincy nods.

                    KYRA (cont'd)
          So are you going to be the kind of
          husband who won't let his wife work?

                    QUINCY
          Nah.

                    KYRA
               (playfully)
          Why not?

                    QUINCY
          You might be the only one with a job.

                    KYRA
          Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's
          going well.  You'll be back before you
          know it.

                    QUINCY
          Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it.
          Busting my ass, for what?

                    KYRA
          To do what you love.

                    QUINCY
          I don't know sometimes.

                    KYRA
          You're just scared.  I know rehab is
          hard, and you have to worry about whether
          you'll be as good as you were but you
          will be.  I believe in you.  You just
          have to get back on the court.  Like
          you'd get back on a horse.

                    QUINCY
               (beat)
          A horse?

                    KYRA
          Don't make fun of me when I'm being
          wonderful and supportive.
               (then)
          You belong on the court.  Just like I
          belong in the stands, looking cute and
          cheering you on.

     She smiles, gives him a kiss, moves back to her packing.  Off
     Quincy:

     INT. BANK - DAY

     Monica sits at her desk in a blouse and skirt, punching
     numbers into the computer.  A man sits down in the chair
     opposite her.  Monica glances up.  It's her father.

                    NATHAN
          Hey, munchkin.

                    MONICA
          Dad.  What are you doing here?

                    NATHAN
          I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been
          hearing good things about you.

                    MONICA
          That tends to happen when you're the
          boss's daughter.

                    NATHAN
          So how's the job going?

     Monica forces a smile.

                    MONICA
          You know.

     Nathan looks at her, nods.

                    NATHAN
          I think I know what the problem is.

     He pulls a GARBAGE CAN HOOP from a plastic shopping bag.
     Monica smiles.  He attaches it to her garbage can.

                    NATHAN (cont'd)
          There.

     He shoots an ugly, imaginary shot.  She laughs.

                    MONICA
          You shoot like a girl.

                    NATHAN
          I'll take that as a compliment.

     He gives her a smile, and exits.  Monica looks at the hoop,
     then crumples a piece of paper.

                    MONICA
               (whispering)
          And she gets the steal.  Monica goes one-
          on-one against Jordan, she stops, pops...

     Monica shoots.  The paper drops through the net.

                    MONICA (cont'd)
               (still whispering)
          It's good!  It's good!

     She glances up, notices a few patrons watching her.  Monica
     quickly composes herself and goes back to her work.

     EXT. WRIGHT AND MCCALL HOUSES - DUSK

     Monica exits her car, after a long day at work.  She wears
     very low heels.  But she still stumbles.  She curses, then
     hears a laugh.

     She looks up - Quincy sits on the grassy hill above her
     house.

                    QUINCY
          I remember when your mom had to beat you
          into a dress.

     Monica smiles.

                    MONICA
          You visiting?

                    QUINCY
               (nods)
          Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured
          I'd keep Mom company.

                    MONICA
          Who's this guy I always see her around?

                    QUINCY
          Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.

                    MONICA
          So...how's the knee?

                    QUINCY
          Getting there.

                    MONICA
          Strong enough to get you down the aisle?

                    QUINCY
          Yeah.  Two weeks.
               (then)
          I didn't get to send you an invitation,
          but if you...

                    MONICA
          That's okay.  I'm probably, you know,
          busy.

     Quincy nods.  Awkward beat.

                    QUINCY
          Can I ask you something?

     Monica looks at him.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          You never told me why ball isn't fun
          anymore.

                    MONICA
          It just isn't.

                    QUINCY
          Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.

                    MONICA
          You had a rough couple years, that's all.

                    QUINCY
          That a nice way of saying I rode the
          bench?

                    MONICA
          And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is
          tough.

                    QUINCY
          Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four
          and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of
          the attention, but besides that...

                    MONICA
          You're serious.

                    QUINCY
          Seems like I needed a ball when I was
          trying to be like my pops...or trying to
          be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I
          need to try something else.

                    MONICA
          Like what?

                    QUINCY
          Maybe go back to school.

                    MONICA
          Wow.

     Monica stares at him, seeing a man in the boy she grew up
     with.  Quincy looks away, self-conscious.

                    QUINCY
          I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school
          thing yet.
               (then)
          She'll probably say it's the painkillers
          talking.

                    MONICA
          It's a trip, you know?  When you're a
          kid, you see the life you want, and it
          never crosses your mind that it's not
          gonna turn out that way.

                    QUINCY
          So why'd you give up ball?

                    MONICA
          Why do you keep asking me that?

                    QUINCY
          Cause I don't get it.

                    MONICA
          Something was just missing.

                    QUINCY
          What?

     Monica is too hurt, too scared to tell him the truth.

                    MONICA
          It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave
          it alone.

                    QUINCY
          Find.

     Monica turns, crosses to her house.  She stumbles on her
     heels, kicks them off in frustration, and exits inside.
     Quincy walks back to his curb.

     ANGLE ON

     Camille watches from the kitchen window

                                           DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. WRIGHT HOUSE - PATIO - DUSK

     Lena sits next to Camille.  Her one year old son, L.P., sits
     on the ground at her feet.  Monica sits quietly nearby,
     watching.

                    CAMILLE
          So you're still breast-feeding?

                    LENA
          The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm
          still trying to lose some of this baby
          fat.

     She quickly looks over at Monica.

                    LENA (cont'd)
          Shut up.

     Monica gives her a small smile.  Camille looks down at L.P.

                    CAMILLE
          You might want to put a jacket on him,
          it's getting cold.

                    LENA
          He's fine.

                    CAMILLE
               (warning)
          Okay.

     Lena sighs, rolls her eyes.  She picks up her son.

                    LENA
          Come on, L.P.  Grandma says it's too
          cold.

     She exits inside.  Camille makes a face.

                    CAMILLE
          God.  "Grandma."

     Monica smiles.  And then silence.  There is still so much
     distance between them, so many misunderstanding.  Camille
     stares at her daughter.  And then...

                    CAMILLE (cont'd)
          You know, I'd probably be a lot more
          "prissy" in the situation than you'd
          like, but the thing I always admired that
          drove me crazy, was the fight you had in
          you.

                    MONICA
          What are you talking about?

                    CAMILLE
          When I said Quincy could do better, I was
          thinking about you.

     Monica stares at her mom.  Camille stands and leaves.
     
     
       INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - NIGHT



     Monica lies in her bed, staring up at the ceiling, unable to

     sleep.  Her mind races with thoughts of her past, her

     choices, her future...



     Suddenly, she climbs out of bed.  She wears a tank-top and
     pajama bottoms.  She crosses to her window, pulls it open and
     climbs out.

     EXT. WRIGHT AND MCCALL HOUSES - CONTINUOUS

     Monica drops down.  She moves to Quincy's window and knocks
     quietly.  Beat, then Quincy appears.  Bare-chested and in a
     pair of shorts.  He looks at her, then pulls open the window.

                    QUINCY
               (half-asleep)
          What's going on?

                    MONICA
          We need to talk.

     Quincy just looks at her.

                    MONICA (cont'd)
          Please.

                    QUINCY
          Hold on.

     Quincy disappears for a moment, then returns, pulling on a T-
     shirt.  He climbs out of his window, drops to the ground.

     Quincy looks at her.

                    MONICA
          You asked me what was missing.

                    QUINCY
          What?

                    MONICA
          From basketball.

                    QUINCY
          you woke me up to tell me that?

                    MONICA
          It's not fun for me anymore because
          you're missing.

     Quincy stares at her.

                    MONICA (cont'd)
          What I'm trying to say is --

                    QUINCY
          I heard enough.

                    MONICA
          What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you
          since I was eleven and the shit won't go
          away.

                    QUINCY
          We haven't talked since college and now
          you wait two weeks before my wedding to
          say something like this?

                    MONICA
          I know, I probably should have said it
          two weeks ago.

     Quincy doesn't even crack a smile.  In fact, he glares.

                    QUINCY
          You haven't changed.  You still think the
          sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well,
          guess what, it doesn't.

                    MONICA
          Then why are you so upset?

                    QUINCY
          Because you don't pull this on someone
          who's about to get married.

                    MONICA
          Better late than never, right?

                    QUINCY
          Wrong.

     Quincy starts back toward the window.

                    MONICA
          I'll play you.

                    QUINCY
          What?

                    MONICA
          One game.  One-on-one.

                    QUINCY
          For what?

                    MONICA
          Your heart.

     Quincy looks at her in disbelief, then laughs at the
     absurdity.

                    QUINCY
          You're out of your mind.

                    MONICA
          So you're gonna bitch up?

                    QUINCY
          What's that supposed to be, psychology?

                    MONICA
          I know why you broke up with me in
          college.  And not that what you did
          wasn't messed up, but what I did was,
          too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive
          you.

                    QUINCY
          Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I
          couldn't trust anybody, okay.  I mean, I
          was lost.  So you are forgiven.  But that
          was five years ago.  I moved on.

     Monica moves past him, reaches through his window.  She drops
     back down, holding his basketball.

                    MONICA
          Prove it.

     She throws him the ball.

                    QUINCY
          What will this prove?

                    MONICA
          You once said the reason I beat you was
          because you wanted me to.

                    QUINCY
          So?

                    MONICA
          So, if I win it's because deep down you
          know you're about to make the biggest
          mistake of your life, and deep down your
          want me to stop you.

                    QUINCY
          And what happens when you lose?

                    MONICA
          If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding
          present.

     Quincy stares at her.
     
       EXT. MCCALL HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - SHORT TIME LATER



     Monica stands opposite Quincy.  Both are suited up in

     basketball gear.



     They stare at each other, ready to go to war. Monica tosses
     him the ball.

                    MONICA
          Check.

     Quincy tosses the ball back.  Monica drives.  Quincy's knee
     is maybe at sixty percent and he can't keep up.  She scores
     easily.

     She walks to the top of the driveway, tosses him the ball.

                    MONICA (cont'd)
          One, zip.  Check.

     Quincy rubs his scarred knee, then passes it back.

     The game continues.  Monica owns the first five points easily
     by exploiting Quincy's injury.

     Monica drives for another lay-up.  Quincy suddenly lets go of
     his fear, leaps and swats her shot.

     He grabs the rebound and lays it up.  He nods intensely, as
     he grabs the ball and walks back to the top of the key.

                    QUINCY
          One, five.  Check.

     The game continues and now Quincy has the upper-hand, using
     his size and strength.  He scores seven straight points.

     The score stays close.  It is a sexually-charged battle of
     wills -- Quincy pulls off his sweat-soaked shirt.  Their
     bodies collide as they wrestle for the ball.  Monica yanks
     off her jersey in frustration.  Her ass bumps into his hips
     as she backs him in.  Her hands slide across his chest as she
     guards him...

     Finally, the score hits nine, nine.  Monica slowly walks to
     the top of the key.

                    MONICA
          Nine, up.  Point.

     She tosses Quincy the ball.

                    MONICA (cont'd)
          Check.

     Quincy tosses the ball back, drops low on defense.  Monica
     fakes an outside shot and Quincy bites.  Monica drives around
     him.  SHE HAS A WIDE-OPEN LAY-UP.  SHE PUTS IT UP..AND IT
     ROLLS OFF THE RIM.  Monica can't believe it.

     Quincy grabs the loose ball and clears it.  He stares at
     Monica as he dribbles in front of her.  She stares back.

     He breaks for the basket.  Monica stays with him.  He goes
     up.  Monica jumps, desperately tries to block his shot.
     Quincy dunks on her, knocking her to the ground.  He lets go
     of the rim, and tumbles to the ground also.  GAME OVER.

     Silence.  Quincy stares at her.  Monica looks back.  Then:

                    QUINCY
               (pointed)
          All's fair in love and basketball, right?

     Monica struggles to fight back her tears as she picks herself up.
     She slowly walks back toward her house.  And then:

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          Hey.

     Monica slowly stops, turns.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          Double or nothing.

     Monica stares at him, wonders if she heard right.  Quincy
     limps to his feet, picks up the ball and holds it out to her.

     Monica slowly walks back to him.  They stare at each other.
     No more egos, no more bullshit.  Just love.

     In the moonlight, on the blacktop, they kiss...

                                        FADE TO BLACK.
                                        
       FADE IN:



     INT. LOS ANGELES FORUM - NIGHT



     Music is blasting, banners are waving, crowd is screaming.



     Magic Johnson sits in a floor seat, watching the game.  A

     REPORTER interviews him.

                    SPORTS REPORTER
          So, Magic, are you contemplating another
          comeback?

                    MAGIC
               (laughs)
          No more comebacks.  Tonight I'm just
          enjoying being a spectator.

     Behind him, in a second row seat, a ONE YEAR BLACK GIRL sits
     in a lap, bouncing, watching feet and legs ballin' on the
     court.

     Quincy leans down, gives the little girl a kiss, then looks
     out at the court.  It's the Los Angeles Sparks and the New
     York Liberty.  The WNBA.

     On the court, the women line up for a free-throw.

                    QUINCY
          Let's go, McCall!

     Monica, sporting a uniform with Wright-McCall on the back and
     the number thirty-two, looks over.  Quincy takes their
     daughter's hand and waves it.

                    QUINCY (cont'd)
          Go Mommy.

     Monica smiles back, then steps to the line.  The referee
     tosses her the ball.  Monica stares at the basket, then
     bounces the ball twice, licks her lips and shoots.

                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                        "THAT'S GAME"
      END CREDITS
