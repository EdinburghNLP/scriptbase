          EXT. STREET - DAY
                         
          A small kid, TJ FORNEY (13), with a grubby worn cast on his arm,
          rides his BMX really fast down a street. He chases a tow truck
          towing a badly wrecked red Volvo.
                         
          He struggles to keep up. The truck makes a turn. TJ follows,
          turning dangerously in front of oncoming traffic.
                         
          The truck makes another turn. TJ turns with it, running straight
          into the side of a car pulling out of a driveway. He comes off
          his bike and is thrown across the hood. He picks himself up,
          stunned. The driver of the car gets out to see if he's hurt.
                         
          TJ looks down the street to see the tow truck disappearing in
          the distance. He hurries back to his bike. He jumps on and
          continues after the truck.
                         
          TJ gives chase. He gains on the truck. He can see it pull into a
          used car lot ahead - FAIR OAKS CAR CITY.
                         
          EXT. FAIR OAKS CAR CITY - DAY
                         
          TJ arrives at the car lot as the TOW TRUCK DRIVER is lowering
          the car onto the drive. TJ dumps his bike, out of breath.
                         
                          TJ
           This car has to go back.
                         
           TOW TRUCK DRIVER
           Huh?
                         
                          TJ
           This car has to go back to where it
           came from. Put it back on the truck.
                         
           TOW TRUCK DRIVER
           What are you talking about, kid?
                         
          The driver continues working, unhooking the car from the truck.
                         
                          TJ
           Stop unhooking it. There's been a
           mistake.
                         
           TOW TRUCK DRIVER
           I was told to bring it here. That's
           what it says on my work order. Talk to
           that guy if you've got a problem.
                         
          The driver nods in the direction of LARRY TOWERS, who is
          approaching with 17 year-old DUSTIN HOWARD and another man,
          TONY, in dirty overalls.

           (to tow truck driver)
           Hey, Bill.
                         
          Larry shakes the tow truck driver's hand.
                         
                          TJ
           This car has to go back where it came
           from.
                         
                          LARRY
           I beg your pardon?
                         
                          TJ
           It was brought here by mistake.
                         
          Larry smiles at the little out-of-breath kid.
                         
                          LARRY
           And where was it supposed to go?
                         
                          TJ
           It wasn't supposed to go anywhere. It
           needs to go back where it came from.
           The guy who sold it to you made a
           mistake.
                         
                          LARRY
                          (TO TONY)
           What's the deal with this car again,
           Tony?
                         
          Tony flips through a stack of papers he's holding.
                         
                          TONY
           Ah let's see, we bought this car
           yesterday afternoon from a Paul Forney-
                         
                          TJ
           That's my dad. It wasn't his to sell.
                         
                          LARRY
           Well, it's his name on the pink slip,
           son. And that means it's his to sell
           if he wants.
                         
                          TJ
           Yeah, but I'm just telling you it was
           a mistake, OK, so it needs to go back
           where it came from.

          The car has now been lowered off the back of the tow truck.
          Larry moves away from TJ and approaches the driver.
                         
                          LARRY
           Thanks, Bill.
                          (TO TONY)
           You got that work order there?
                         
          Tony looks through his papers for the work order. TJ doesn't
          like being ignored. He moves around to the driver's side of the
          wrecked car and wrenches open the bashed-in door. He climbs
          behind the wheel, slams the door shut and locks the door.
                         
                          LARRY (CONT'D)
           Get out of the car, son.
                         
          TJ ignores him. Larry doesn't have time for this.
                         
                          LARRY (CONT'D)
           Dustin, get him outta there, will ya?
                         
          Dustin moves around to the open driver's side window.
                         
                          DUSTIN
           Come on dude, get out of the car.
                         
          TJ turns the key and begins winding the window up. Dustin
          reaches in trying to unlock the door.
                         
                          DUSTIN (CONT'D)
           C'mon. Open it.
                         
          The window is rising. Dustin grabs at TJ. TJ keeps winding the
          window. It gets to the top, trapping Dustin's arm.
                         
                          DUSTIN (CONT'D)
           Ow, fuck. What the fuck you doing?
           Open it.
                         
          Dustin is stuck. Larry, Bill and Tony laugh. Dustin yells at TJ.
          TJ ignores him, staring straight ahead.
                         
          The men laugh some more. Dustin's humiliation sets in.
                         
                          DUSTIN (CONT'D)
           Put down the fuckin' window. I'm
           serious.
                         
          Larry goes around to the passenger's side broken window and
          opens the door. He leans in and easily drags TJ out of the car.

           I'd get out of here kid, before he
           works himself loose.
                         
          TJ's not getting the car back. The men continue laughing at the
          trapped Dustin. TJ picks up his bike and rides away defeated.
                         
          INT. FORNEY HOUSE / KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          TJ sits at the kitchen table with his tiny 85 year-old GRANDMA
          and his depressed and dishevelled DAD, Paul Forney (45). Dad has
          a full shaggy beard and a recently healed wound on his forehead.
                         
          They eat in silence. There's tension in the air.
                         
                          GRANDMA
           There's still plenty of applesauce
           boys.
                         
                          TJ
                          (TO DAD)
           I don't get why what I think doesn't
           matter.
                         
                          DAD
           It couldn't stay in the front of the
           house anymore, TJ. I'm not having this
           conversation again.
                         
                          TJ
           Yeah, why not?
                         
                          DAD
           It's there everyday and I have to look
           at it.
                         
                          TJ
           When do you look at it? When was the
           last time you got off the couch?
                         
                          DAD
           It's not healthy.
                         
                          TJ
           Neither are all the pills you're
           taking, but I don't tell you not to
           take them.
                         
                          DAD
           I don't wanna talk about it anymore.

           I don't. And that's it.
                         
          TJ fumes. They eat in silence a bit more. TJ drops his fork and
          leaves the table, angry.
                         
                          GRANDMA
           It's OK dear. He just needs time. It's
           his first day back tomorrow. Lets try
           and be patient.
                         
          Dad is a mess.
                         
                          GRANDMA (CONT'D)
           One thing at a time dear. One thing at
           a time.
                         
                          DAD
           Yeah, I know, mom.
                         
          Grandma nods quietly.
                         
          INT. FORNEY HOUSE / BATHROOM - MORNING
                         
          TJ gives his mouth a once over with a toothbrush. He spits, then
          sets his toothbrush down on the edge of the sink.
                         
          INT. FORNEY HOUSE / TV ROOM - MORNING
                         
          TJ stands holding a banana and wearing a backpack in front of
          the couch where his dad is sleeping. Dad is lying face down,
          half-covered with a sheet, his leg hanging off the side. There's
          dirty plates and pill bottles on the coffee table in what is
          otherwise an old lady's living room. Dad stirs, it's a pathetic
          sight.
                         
          TJ taps Dad's leg with his foot. Dad slowly comes to life and
          notices TJ.
                         
                          TJ
           Can I have some money so I can buy
           lunch today?
                         
                          DAD
           Yeah.
                         
          Dad sits up on the couch, he looks a total mess. Dad pick up his
          wallet from the mess of a coffee table and hands TJ a few
          dollars.

          TJ exits, leaving Dad sitting there. Dad sets his wallet back
          down and stares blankly into the room. We hear the door slam in
          the background.
                         
          EXT. FORNEY HOUSE - MORNING
                         
          TJ on his BMX pedals down the drive and out onto the street.
                         
          EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          TJ pedals in the middle of a suburban street. He steers his bike
          with his broken arm as he tries to peel and eat the banana with
          the other. He glides down a hill. It's a long hill. He travels
          fast.
                         
          Despite the glide and the wind in his hair he's slouching and
          looks depressed.
                         
          EXT. HOUSING DEVELOPMENT - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          TJ rides his bike through an eerily barren unfinished housing
          development - half-built houses and perfectly sealed wide
          streets.
                         
          Up ahead, he can see a small section of unfinished road - a big
          patch of dirt and rocks. He veers up a driveway to avoid it. He
          passes the dirt patch and then comes down off the curb back onto
          the road, trying to keep control of his bike. He hits the road
          and loses his balance. The handlebars twist and he crashes onto
          the road.
                         
          He jumps up and yelps in pain, clutching his elbow. He looks at
          it. It's badly grazed. He yelps again, angry. He picks up a rock
          lying in the street and charges towards an unfinished house. He
          hurls the rock through its front window. Glass crashes down.
                         
          A silent beat passes, and then the front door of the house opens
          and a late-20s, long-greasy-haired, wiry shirtless guy in filthy
          black jeans emerges. He has a baby moustache and a cracked front
          tooth. This is HESHER. He makes a determined line toward TJ.
                         
                          HESHER
           The fuck you think you're doing!?
                         
          Before TJ can back away Hesher grabs him by the back of his T-
          shirt and drags him kicking and squealing towards the house.

          INT. HALF-BUILT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Hesher drags TJ into the unfinished front room. He slams TJ
          against an uncoated drywall. Hesher pulls a pair of garden
          shears from his back pocket and squeezes TJ's nose between the
          blades.
                         
          TJ is terrified. He squirms.
                         
                          HESHER
           The fuck you think you're doing!?
                         
                          TJ
           Nothing.
                         
                          HESHER
           You got five seconds or I'm gonna cut
           your fuckin' nose off.
                         
                          TJ
           I was just, I was just going to
           school. I, I didn't know anyone was
           here.
                         
          Hesher stares intimidatingly at TJ. TJ looks seriously scared.
                         
                          HESHER
           Bullshit. You're gonna fuckin' -
                         
          Hesher is suddenly startled. His ears prick up like a rabbit. He
          hits the deck dragging TJ down with him. Their faces are close
          together. Hesher makes a very serious finger-to-mouth gesture to
          'shhhh'.
                         
          The SOUND of a car idling outside. Hesher listens.
                         
          TJ is on his stomach, freaked. TJ looks around the room - a
          duffel bag, some beer cans, a few porn magazines, a weathered
          bass guitar and a sleeping bag.
                         
          A car door closes loudly. Hesher peers through the window and
          sees a SECURITY GUARD inspecting TJ's bike in the front yard and
          then making his way toward the house.
                         
          Hesher looks at TJ with serious and considered venom.
                         
                          HESHER (CONT'D)
           You just fucked me.
                         
          Hesher snaps into action. With speed and precision he gathers
          his stuff together. He shoves it all his duffel bag.

          Hesher lights the fuse on a stick of homemade dynamite wrapped
          in duct tape and throws it through the broken window. He then
          slips out the back door, leaving TJ face down on the floor
          freaked out and confused.
                         
           SECURITY GUARD (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           What the hell-
                         
          BOOM! Dirt sprays against the house and pours in through the
          window. TJ cowers, then hears the guttural roar of a van
          starting up. He hears the van screech away.
                         
           SECURITY GUARD (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           Hey! Get back here!
                         
          TJ jumps to his feet and looks out the window. A dirty black van
          screams out onto the road and tears away, spraying dirt and
          rocks in its wake. The security guard stumbles around, covered
          in dirt and disoriented. He rushes back to his car and gives
          chase. TJ lets them get away up the street, then bolts to the
          front door.

          Outside a public high school, kids mill around before class.
          Lots of noise.
                         
          TJ rides down a path and clocks Dustin Howard, the kid from the
          car lot, who stands talking with friends by his car - a shiny
          2007 YELLOW CONVERTIBLE MUSTANG. They spot each other. TJ
          quickly looks away (oh shit) and b-lines for the bike rack.

          TJ opens his locker. He pulls out a clear zip-lock bag with a
          rotten apple inside. He looks at it a moment then puts it back
          in the locker.
                         
          A kid puts his hand on TJ's shoulder.

                          KID 2
           I came by your house a while ago, see
           if you wanted to come skateboarding or
           something, but it looked like the
           place was empty. Have you moved or
           something?
                         
                          KID 1
           Yeah, I tried calling you a bunch of
           times, but it kept saying there was a
           new number or something.
                         
                          TJ
           Yeah, we moved in with my Grandma for
           a little while.
                         
                          KID 1
           Oh OK, cool... I didn't want to call
           cause I didn't know.
           (changing the subject)
           You want some of my bagel?
                         
                          TJ
           No. Thanks.
                         
          Awkward beat. TJ doesn't want to make chit-chat. People are
          already making him feel weird.
                         
                          KID 1

           Ah, if you want I guess, but I'm
           getting it off tomorrow, so there's no
           point really.

          TJ sits in class, at the back near the window. The teacher, MRS
          ELSBERRY, a big African-American lady, is taking roll. Kids
          answer as their names are called.

          TJ gives a half hearted nod. The class turns to look at him. A
          couple whisper. TJ looks away. The teacher continues taking
          roll.

          He notices a guy high up in the bleachers smoking a cigarette
          and staring at him through long hair.
                         
          TJ looks concerned. Is this Hesher, the guy with the garden
          shears?
                         
          INT. FAIR OAKS HIGH SCHOOL / HALL - DAY

          crowd.
                         
          Suddenly TJ is grabbed and slammed against a locker. It's Dustin
          Howard and his posse. Dustin towers over him.

          TJ squirms trying to free himself, kicking wildly. One of TJ's
          kicks catches Dustin. Dustin punches him. A crowd quickly
          gathers.

                          COUNSELLOR
           Hey, hey, hey. I do not wanna hear
           that kind of language in my office.
                         
                          TJ
           Yeah, but I didn't -
                         
                          COUNSELLOR
           Listen, I'm gonna cut you some slack,
           but you're gonna have to meet me
           halfway here.
                         
          TJ shakes his head. He gives up on this conversation. He looks
          out the window. Hesher is out there - smoking and watching.
                         
          TJ is suddenly unnerved.

           I should really be suspending you, but
           I won't if you can promise me you'll
           put in a real effort...

          EXT. FAIR OAKS HIGH SCHOOL - LATE AFTERNOON
                         
          It's after school. TJ walks out to his bike. It's the last one
          left on the rack. Only a couple of other kids are still on
          campus. TJ looks around. He jumps on his bike and quickly rides
          off.
                         
          INT. FORNEY HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
                         
          TJ enters the house, which is quiet except for the sounds of a
          TV. There are no lights on so it feels dark.
                         
          He walks past the TV room, the TV is on. Dad is on his back,
          fast asleep, mouth wide open. He barely seems alive, until he
          makes a small whimper. His mouth closes, he swallows, then his
          mouth drops open again.
                         
          TJ picks up the remote control from a mess of empty pill bottles
          on the coffee table and switches off the TV.
                         
          TJ walks past the kitchen and drops his backpack.
                         
          INT. FORNEY HOUSE / GRANDMA'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          TJ walks past his grandma's bedroom. The door is open. He gently
          knocks. She's sitting up in bed, reading.
                         
                          GRANDMA
           Hi, pumpkin.
                         
                          TJ
           Hey.
                         
          TJ stands in the doorway. Grandma takes off her glasses.
                         
                          GRANDMA
           How was your day?
                         
                          TJ
           Pretty much sucked.
                         
                          GRANDMA
           Why sweetheart?
                         
          TJ thinks for a moment.
                         
                          TJ
           I don't know. It just sucked.

                          GRANDMA

                          TJ
           I don't know, maybe, a little.
                         
                          GRANDMA
           Maybe I need new glasses?
                         
          She holds her glasses up for closer inspection.
                         
                          GRANDMA (CONT'D)
           Actually, I don't even know if these
           are mine.

           Geez, I don't know.
                         
                          TJ
           Well, can you see better with them?
                         
                          GRANDMA
           Jesus, I don't know.
                         
          Grandma holds the glasses in different positions.
                         
                          GRANDMA (CONT'D)
           You know my mother always told me that
           I'd damage my eyes if I read by poor
           light and I always think about that
           when I'm reading, but I've gotten this
           far, so why am I still worrying about
           it? Why am I even reading? There's
           something more I need to learn?
                         
          She give this a moment of thought.
                         
                          GRANDMA (CONT'D)
           I guess there's always something more
           to learn.

          She seems almost tickled by this. She slips her bookmark in her
          book and puts it on her bedside table.

           Well, you know, sometimes people get
           knocked off course a little when bad
           things happen. But they come good in
           the end.
                         
          INT. FORNEY HOUSE / KITCHEN - EVENING
                         
          TJ sits at the kitchen table alone staring at a cute and happy
          bunny salt and pepper shakers. He can see in through to the TV
          room where Grandma is shaking Dad awake on the couch for dinner
          and holding a glass of milk for him.
                         
          Dad lifts himself off the couch. Grandma hands him the glass of
          milk.
                         
                          GRANDMA
           Here's some milk to wet your whistle.
                         
                          DAD
           Thanks mom.
                         
          Dad shuffles into the kitchen and takes his seat at the table.
          Dad empties a couple of pills into his palm and downs them with
          milk. TJ forks his food around his plate.
                         
                          DAD (CONT'D)

           That's a good question.
                         
          Dad scrapes a mouthful onto his fork, avoiding the good
          question. A moment passes. TJ stares at him.
                         
                          TJ
           Are you gonna answer it?

           I don't know. I'm not ready yet.
                         
          Dad's eyes are lowered. He stares at his plate. TJ watches him,
          feeling powerless.
                         
                          TJ
           I'm not ready yet either.
                         
          They eat in silence.

           Did you know that when Albert Einstein

           it, he would not give them the job.
                         
          Grandma looks up at TJ with a small grin. She sets the salt
          shaker down.

          off his cast with a little buzz saw.
                         
          The doctor pulls the cast free and inspects TJ's arm. It is pale
          and skinny compared to the other.
                         
                          DOCTOR
           (referring to the smell)
           Whoa, that's like an eight week old
           dirty sock. OK, so how does that feel?
           You wanna turn your wrist like this
           for me?
                         
          The doctor demonstrates. TJ imitates.
                         
                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)
           And like this.
                         
          The doctor twists his wrist in a different direction. TJ does
          the same. The doctor looks for a pen.
                         
                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)

           I don't know. It feels kinda weird, I
           can't tell.
                         
                          DOCTOR
           It will feel strange for a few days,
           but should start to feel normal again
           soon. Alright, lookin' good. I s'pose
           I should write you a note for school.
                         
          The doctor writes the note. While he does so he makes chit chat.
                         
                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)
           How's your Dad doing?
                         
                          TJ
           Not great. I don't know. You should
           probably just ask him yourself.

           If we consider that dreams serve a
           metaphoric function in narrative
           fiction, as they do in life, what
           metaphoric function would you suggest
           the dreams here are serving?
                         
          TJ sits in the back of the class, by the window.
                         
          A little pebble hits TJ's desk. It bounces onto the floor. TJ
          looks around to find where it came from - and then another one
          hits him in the head.
                         
          He looks out the window. Hesher is right outside the window. He
          takes the cap off of a large BLACK MAGIC MARKER. He holds it up
          to his nose and takes a long slow inhale. He exhales slow and
          long, staring hard at TJ.
                         
          TJ looks around confused. Hesher recaps the marker, throws it
          hard at TJ and wanders off. The marker hits TJ, then falls to
          floor near his feet. He reaches for it. Mrs. Elsberry sees this.
                         
           MRS ELSBERRY (CONT'D)
           TJ! What are you doing? Please pass
           that forward.
                         
          TJ passes the marker forward. Mrs. Elsberry sets the marker on
          her desk.
                         
           MRS ELSBERRY (CONT'D)
           You can collect this after class.
                         
          She continues back to the chalkboard.

           OK, so for our protagonist, are these
           dreams premonitions or desires or even
           nightmares perhaps?
                         
          EXT. FAIR OAKS HIGH SCHOOL - AFTERNOON
                         
          It's after school. Kids are leaving campus. TJ wheels his bike
          across the school yard.
                         
          EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          TJ rides his bike down the street. Dustin's YELLOW MUSTANG
          appears beside him. Dustin is boiling.
                         
                          DUSTIN
           You're fuckin' dead.

          We see that someone has drawn - in BIG BLACK MARKER - a crude
          picture of a body, sitting on a toilet with a big erect penis.
          The picture is drawn on the side of Dustin's Mustang door, so
          his real head lines up with the drawing. It's drawn in
          perspective so it looks like Dustin's head is attached to the
          naked defecating body to outsiders. The words 'SUCK MY COCK'
          have been scrawled beside the picture. Dustin swerves the car
          toward TJ, narrowly missing him. TJ cuts into a large super
          market parking lot, attempting to get away.
                         
          Dustin accelerates ahead of TJ and screeches to a halt in front
          of him, cutting him off, almost hitting him. TJ stumbles and
          falls off his bike. His bike lands on top of him.
                         
          Dustin jumps out of his car and starts beating TJ in the middle
          of parking lot traffic. TJ struggles just to protect himself,
          cowering on the ground and covering his head. Dustin tries to
          wrestle TJ free of the bike so as to get a clearer shot at him.
          He drags TJ by his T-shirt, ripping it off in the process.
                         
          And then a WOMAN'S VOICE -
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           Hey!
                         
          Dustin ignores the voice. He continues beating TJ.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           Hey! Leave him alone!
                         
          Dustin ignores again.
                         
                          VOICE (CONT'D)
           Hey! I said stop it!
                         
          Dustin ignores one last time - a beat passes, then the woman,
          NICOLE (mid-20s), appears behind Dustin and jumps onto his back,
          bear hugging his face.
                         
                          NICOLE
           Leave him alone!
                         
          Dustin shakes erratically, Nicole has a tight grip on him, but
          eventually Dustin manages to throw her onto the ground.
                         
                          DUSTIN
           What the fuck are you doing lady?
                         
          Nicole picks herself up off the ground and holds up her fists
          like she's ready to fight. She doesn't look very tough.

           What are you doing?!
                         
          Nicole stands defiantly between Dustin and TJ. Dustin looks
          around at the scene he's created in the street. A man steps out
          of his car. Dustin realizes it's time to go.
                         
                          DUSTIN
                          (TO TJ)
           I'm not finished, you fuck.
                         
          He gets back into his car, slams the door and speeds off.
                         
          Nicole watches him go, then helps TJ up. TJ is shirtless,
          scrawny, dirty and traumatized.
                         
                          NICOLE
           Are you alright?
                         
                          TJ

                          TJ
           I don't know.
                         
          TJ grabs his T-shirt and pulls it back on. He picks his bike up
          off the ground and hops on. He goes to peddle, but the chain is
          busted. His peddling goes nowhere.

          in the back.
                         
                          NICOLE
           I can't believe he called me lady. Do
           I look like a lady to you?
                         
                          TJ

           Thanks. I mean do I look old? Well
           anyway, at least I can say I've been
           in a fight.
                         
          She thinks about this for a beat. TJ is silent.

          seats.
                         
                          TJ
           I think your ice cream's melting.

           Oh shit.
                         
          She tries to pick it up, suddenly flustered. It drips
          everywhere. She doesn't know what to do with it. It's too melted
          to eat.
                         
                          NICOLE (CONT'D)
           Ah, fuck it.
                         
          She throws it out the window.

                          NICOLE
           Well actually, I basically just didn't
           want to have to go home and then spend
           the rest of the day feeling bad about
           the fact that I didn't help you and
           then hear about you on the news being
           beat to death in the parking lot. So
           you know, really I'm just - I did it
           for me. I'm just selfish.

          TJ is silent, he has no idea how to respond to this girl. She
          spots a gas station.

           Perfect landing.
                         
          She gets out of the car.

          Nicole walks off. TJ watches her for a beat then his eye wanders
          over the contents of her messy car. He picks up a white name tag
          from the coin tray between the seats. It reads:
                         
          RALPH'S - Hi my name is NICOLE, how can I help you?
                         
          TJ looks up and sees Nicole heading back to the car. He puts the
          name tag down as the car door opens and Nicole gets in. She
          hands him a stick of red licorice covered in green sugar.
                         
                          NICOLE (CONT'D)

           I know, that's the point. I used to
           hate this crazy sour stuff, I don't
           know what happened. I just recently
           acquired a taste for it. I don't even
           really know what's in it, but I pretty
           much eat it all the time. And I'm sure
           it's making me fat. I just don't want
           to end up like those fat old ladies
           you sometimes see, you know, the
           really fat ones?

           I don't know why I'm telling you this.
           Anyway, I was secretly hoping that you
           loved these -
                         
          Holding up the licorice, then taking a bite.
                         
                          NICOLE (CONT'D)
           So you could eat 'em for me. But now I
           can see you don't like em' and I'm
           kinda glad cuz it means more for me. I
           guess I'm sort of a hypocrite in a
           way.
                         
          She smiles at that. TJ attempts to smile back, but he's so
          confused he ends up making a strange face. He awkwardly looks
          away.

          TJ notices his bike still in Nicole's back seat.

           Shit.
                         
          TJ rushes back. He drags it out of her car.
                         
                          TJ (CONT'D)
           Thanks.
                         
          He wheels it back towards the house. TJ goes around the side of
          the house to the back door. He knocks on the back door. Grandma
          appears at the door.
                         
                          GRANDMA
           Hi, TJ. What you doing around the
           back?
                         
          Grandma lets TJ in. TJ is nervous.

          TJ heads for the living room.

                          GRANDMA
           Your Dad's gone to the supermarket,
           honey. Everything OK?
                         
                          TJ
           Ah, yeah, OK.
                         
          But TJ isn't listening. He can't stop thinking about that black
          van. He exits the kitchen.

          through the peephole.
                         
          The black van is parked directly in front of the house. TJ can't
          see properly through the hole.
                         
          He turns, to get a better look through the TV room window.

          TJ turns to the living room. There is Hesher standing in the
          middle of the room with a dirty duffel bag over his shoulder.
                         
          TJ is petrified. They stand looking at each other for a long
          moment.
                         
                          HESHER
           Where's the laundry room?
                         
                          TJ
           My dad'll be home soon.

           Why?
                         
                          HESHER
           You've got two seconds to tell me
           where the laundry room is before I
           tear your fuckin' head off and skull
           fuck you.
                         
          TJ points to a door off the lounge.
                         
                          TJ
           It's through there. But why? You can't
           - my dad's gonna be home soon.
                         
          Hesher stares at him for a second, then heads for the door.

          Hesher empties his sack into the washing machine. TJ steps into
          the room, wary. Hesher ignores him.
                         
          Hesher strips off his T-shirt and jeans and add them to the
          load. He's now standing in the laundry room wearing underwear
          only. TJ sees bad burn scars running down Hesher's thighs.
                         
          Hesher pours laundry detergent liberally into the machine.
                         
                          TJ
           What are you doing? You can't -
                         
          Hesher turns on a dime and grabs TJ by his throat and pins him
          against the wall.

          He closes the lid. He wrenches the dial around and clicks
          'start'. The machine begins a loud cycle. Hesher exits. TJ
          follows awkwardly.

           You can't smoke in here.
                         
          Hesher drags deep and blows the smoke out in a long whistle
          straight into the air above him.
                         
                          TJ (CONT'D)

          TJ enters the kitchen. Grandma is crumbing chicken fillets at
          the counter. She's listening to loud talk radio. TJ goes
          straight for the cupboards and looks through them.
                         
          Grandma turns, eyebrows raised. She turns the radio down.

          TJ gets down on his knees and digs his way through the cupboard
          while Grandma rambles, continuing her chicken crumbing.

           I used to make a cherry cake all the
           time and it always came out just
           wonderful. One time I invited my
           doctor and his wife and I wanted to
           make an impression. I asked him to
           come see your dad in a play and he
           came and I said, 'would you like to
           come back to the house?'
                         
          TJ emerges from the cupboard with a bowl. He turns toward the
          sink and begins to fill it with water.
                         
                          GRANDMA (CONT'D)
           And he said, or his wife said, 'yes
           they'd like to come back.' So earlier
           that day I made a cherry cake and I
           used a - I didn't know it till
           afterwards, I used a new product -
           instead of Crisco, I used Fluffo. They
           never made it again that Fluffo.

          Hesher is on the couch, smoking. The TV is now on. He flips
          channels.
                         
          TJ stands next to Hesher. Hesher looks at him.
                         
          The front door opens and Dad enters, wearing old sweatpants, a
          dirty T-shirt, and carrying a plastic grocery bag.
                         
          He stops when he sees the practically naked, greasy-haired guy
          smoking on the couch (his 'bed'). It's a strange moment.

          He starts going through drawers right next to her. He doesn't
          acknowledge her.
                         
          Grandma notices him, but not seemingly his cigarette, his state
          of undress or his complete stranger-ness.

          Hesher reaches a telephone pole and climbs it nimbly like a
          monkey. At the top, he fiddles around with the fork, banging and
          wrenching at the cable box.
                         
          He drops the fork to the ground and begins his descent. Only a
          couple of feet from the ground, he loses his grip and falls,
          crashing down into a thick bush at the base of the pole.

          TJ and Dad stand staring frozen.
                         
          Hesher lifts himself up out of the bushes, brushes himself off
          and heads back to the house.
                         
          He walks right past them and back inside.

          down beside him. He sits back and watches girl-on-girl action.
                         
          TJ and Dad stand just inside the TV room, stunned, watching the
          newly acquired porn.
                         
          Then a LOUD BUZZ marking the end of the wash's cycle sounds from

          Hesher gets up off the couch and heads for it.
                         
          A stunned and silent (bar the porn noise) moment later, TJ
          follows.

          Dad picks up the remote and switches the TV off.
                         
          INT. FORNEY HOUSE / LAUNDRY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Hesher loads his wet laundry into the dryer. TJ's nervous.
                         
                          TJ
           So, ah, what are you doing now?
                         
          Hesher slams the dryer door shut and wrenches the dial around.
          The dryer starts up loud. Hesher pretends he can't hear TJ.
                         
                          HESHER
           Huh?
                         
          He turns and looks into the garage which is right off the
          laundry room. He points inside.
                         
                          HESHER (CONT'D)
                          (LOUD)
           This your room?
                         
                          TJ
           (huh?)
           That's the garage.
                         
          Hesher walks into the garage with his bag and slams the door
          leaving TJ standing in the laundry room with the noisy dryer.
                         
          INT. FORNEY HOUSE / DINING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          TJ sits at the dinner table with Dad and Grandma. From the
          garage we hear a muffled bass guitar playing loud and heavy.
                         
                          GRANDMA
           Does your friend want to eat some
           dinner dear?
                         
                          TJ
           He's not hungry.
                         
                          GRANDMA
           Are you sure?
                         
                          TJ
           Yeah, I'm sure.
                         
                          DAD
           What's he doing in the garage?

           I don't know. I said he could practice
           his guitar in there.
                         
                          GRANDMA
           That's great honey, it's nice having a
           bit of music in the house again. Is he
           a new friend?
                         
                          TJ
           Yeah, sort of.
                         
                          GRANDMA
           You know your grandfather played the
           harmonica for many years.
                         
          TJ doesn't respond. He eats. Dad looks on perplexed, yet
          disconnected.
                         
          INT. FORNEY HOUSE / BATHROOM - MORNING
                         
          TJ is dressed for school, wet hair. He brushes his teeth. We can
          hear the sound of cartoons in the background. TJ stops brushing
          and listens a second. He hasn't heard cartoons at this hour in a
          long time.
                         
          INT. FORNEY HOUSE / TV ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          TJ enters the TV room. Dad is lying on the couch. Hesher sits on
          an armchair eating a bowl of cereal and watching cartoons.
                         
          TJ stands for a beat and watches them. This is strange.
                         
          INT. FORNEY HOUSE / KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
                         
          TJ enters the kitchen. Grandma pulls a bottle of orange juice
          out of the fridge.
                         
                          GRANDMA (LOUDLY)
           Hesher, would you like a glass of
           orange juice.
                         
           HESHER (O.S.)
           Ah, yeah. Sure.
                         
                          GRANDMA

                          TJ
           Hi, Grandma.

          TJ goes to the counter. He pours cereal into a bowl. He grabs
          the milk carton. He pours it into the bowl, but the carton's
          empty.
                         
                          GRANDMA
           Oh, I'm sorry, honey. We're out of
           milk. I can cook you up some eggs if
           you like, dear.
                         
                          TJ
           No, thanks. I don't have time.
                         
          TJ leans back and looks into the TV room at Hesher enjoying his
          milky cereal.
                         
                          GRANDMA
           Would you like to come for a walk with
           me today?
                         
                          TJ
           I can't, Grandma. I gotta go to
           school.
                         
                          GRANDMA
           No, I mean later. This afternoon.
                         
          TJ grabs his backpack.
                         
                          TJ
           I don't know. Can you ask me when I
           get home?
                         
                          GRANDMA

          EXT. FAIR OAKS HIGH SCHOOL / LUNCH YARD - DAY
                         
          The lunch yard is busy. The crowd clears a moment and we find TJ
          sitting on a bench in the shade, alone and depressed, hidden
          away from the other kids.
                         
          He drinks from a can of soda.
                         
          EXT. FAIR OAKS CAR CITY - DAY
                         
          TJ rides his bike into the car lot.
                         
          TJ stands staring at the crashed red Volvo (from the opening
          scene) that is parked on the lot. He takes a few deep breaths.
           33.

          TJ walks up to an open office door and knocks. Inside is LARRY
          TOWERS. He looks up.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yes?
                         
                          TJ
           I need to talk to you.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, yeah? What about?
                         
          TJ enters and sits opposite.
                         
                          TJ
           I want to get the car back.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah, I figured that. You made it
           pretty clear the last time you were
           here, and I thought I made it pretty
           clear that I couldn't give it to you.
                         
                          TJ
           What do I need to do to get it back?
                         
                          LARRY
           The car's not for sale.
                         
                          TJ
           I want to get it back, though. How
           much do you want for it?
                         
          Larry takes a breath. He doesn't want to be having this
          conversation. He counts the obstacles out on his fingers.
                         
                          LARRY
           I don't know. We're talking at least
           eighteen hundred dollars, not
           including taxes, registration, ADM, or
           dealer's fees. On top of that, you'd
           need a driver's license. I'm guessing
           you don't have one of those. You'd
           need valid car insurance. I'm guessing
           you don't have that either. But even
           if you did have these things, I still
           couldn't sell it to you because the
           car's not street legal. There's a
           million reasons why I can't sell it to
           you.

          For a second it seems Larry feels sympathetic toward TJ.
                         
                          LARRY (CONT'D)
           Look kid, I appreciate your
           enthusiasm, I really do, but I don't
           know what to tell you. You can't have
           the car. End of story.
                         
          TJ churns all this over in his head. Larry thinks he's made
          himself clear. He motions to the papers on his desk.
                         
                          LARRY (CONT'D)
           Do you mind if I get back to it here?

          TJ walks out of Larry's office, forlorn. He walks across the
          showroom, head down, mumbling angrily to himself.
                         
          He is stopped by a hand on his chest. It's Dustin.
                         
                          DUSTIN
           You're lucky I'm at work right now.
                         
          EXT. STREET - DAY
                         
          TJ sits on his bike staring at a Ralph's supermarket.
                         
          INT. RALPH'S SUPERMARKET - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Nicole is at the checkout, checking grocery items. She finishes
          with a customer and TJ appears next in line, with an ice cream
          cone.
                         
                          NICOLE
           Hi Sir, how are you today? Oh, hey.
                         
                          TJ
           Hey.
                         
                          NICOLE
           How's it goin'?
                         
                          TJ
           I got you a replacement ice cream.
                         
          Nicole is a little taken aback.
                         
                          NICOLE
           Oh my god. That's so sweet, thanks.
                         
          TJ smiles awkwardly. He hands her the cone.

          He points to the ice cream counter on the other side of the
          store.
                         
                          NICOLE
           Oh, OK.
                         
          She holds the cone, not quite sure what to do with it, not quite
          sure how to take this kid.
                         
                          NICOLE (CONT'D)

          Nicole watches him leave while a line of customers wait to be
          served. She smiles at the next customer, sharing the moment.

          She starts checking the customer's items, still holding her
          melting cone. She looks up out the door. She can see TJ outside,
          shaking his head and mumbling to himself. He feels like an
          idiot.

          kitchen. He stops abruptly in the doorway.

          Hesher and Grandma are at the counter. Grandma is baking an
          apple pie. Hesher is joyfully eating the apple slices she is
          preparing for the pie. They don't notice TJ.

           - and his wife said, yes they'd like
           to come back to the house.' So earlier
           that day I made a cherry cake and I
           used a new product - I didn't know it
           till afterwards- I used Fluffo. They
           never made it again that Fluffo. It
           was an imitation brand. I served the
           cake and there was silence. And then -
                         
          Grandma makes a clicking sound with her tongue on the roof of
          her mouth.
                         
                          GRANDMA (CONT'D)
                          (LAUGHING)
           You put the cake in your mouth and it
           stuck to the roof of your mouth. They
           could hardly swallow it.
                         
          Hesher finds Grandma's story amusing, he laughs, never losing a
          beat while eating the delicious apple slices.
                         
          Grandma notices that TJ is standing in the doorway.
                         
                          GRANDMA (CONT'D)
                          (STILL LAUGHING)
           Hi sweetheart.
                         
          Hesher glances over, he clearly doesn't give a shit about TJ. TJ
          is not impressed with Hesher either.
                         
          INT. FORNEY HOUSE / KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          TJ, Grandma, Dad and Hesher all sit at the dinner table.
                         
          They eat in an awkward silence. Grandma breaks the ice.
                         
                          GRANDMA
           So who's coming for a walk with me
           tomorrow morning?
                         
          Again silence. Clearly no one is jumping at this opportunity.
                         
                          GRANDMA (CONT'D)
           TJ?
                         
                          TJ
           I can't Grandma. I have school
           tomorrow.
                         
                          GRANDMA
           Ok, well you're always invited.

          Silence again. The sounds of chewing add to the awkwardness of
          this dinner.
                         
                          HESHER
           So what?
                         
          Everyone turns toward Hesher. This is the first thing to come
          out of his mouth all night. He's looking at TJ.
                         
                          HESHER (CONT'D)
           So what school? Go on a walk with your
           Grandma.
                         
          Grandma lights up.
                         
                          GRANDMA
           He's right TJ, it'd be very good for
           you to get some fresh air.
                         
                          HESHER
           Your Grandma goes walking in the
           morning by herself? You can't get your
           ass outta bed like an hour earlier?
           She could get raped.
                         
          Dad stops chewing. TJ looks at Hesher like he's crazy.
                         
                          HESHER (CONT'D)
           I read about this shit all the time.
           Grandmas get raped. You ever hear
           about that guy who killed like 13 old
           ladies.
                         
                          TJ
           What?
                         
                          HESHER
           Fuckin' Google it, dude. The Granny
           Killer, he killed like hella old
           ladies by strangling them with their
           dirty panties.
           (taking a mouthful)
           Not all of them necessarily got
           fucked, but they all got penetrated by
           like the dude's fingers and I don't
           know, other shit too.
                         
                          DAD
           That's enough.

           I just think your Grandma asks you to
           go on a walk, you should go with her
           so she doesn't get raped.
                         
                          GRANDMA
           Why would anyone rape me?
                         
                          HESHER
           I don't know, they do it, Grandma.
           There's some sick fucks out there.
                         
                          DAD
           That's enough.
                         
          Everyone continues to eat in silence. TJ stares at Hesher who is
          shovelling food into his mouth.
                         
          EXT. FAIR OAKS HIGH SCHOOL / LUNCH YARD - DAY
                         
          TJ sits alone in the busy yard, nibbling halfheartedly on
          crackers from his lunch bag.
                         
          Kid 1 from the locker scene earlier appears beside him.
                         
                          KID 1
           Hey, Teej. What are you doing? Come
           sit with us, we're in our spot.
                         
                          TJ
           What? Uh, Ok.
                         
          TJ gets up reluctantly, then notices Hesher walking across the
          yard towards the bathroom followed by an EMO KID with a
          skateboard.
                         
                          TJ (CONT'D)
           I'll meet you there in a second.
                         
          TJ walks off, following Hesher. Kid 1 watches TJ walk off toward
          the bathroom.
                         
          INT. FAIR OAKS HIGH SCHOOL / BATHROOM - DAY
                         
          TJ enters the bathroom. He hears voices coming from a back
          stall. He walks towards them.
                         
          In the end stall TJ finds Hesher finishing a drug deal with the
          Emo kid. Hesher hands him a bag of pot. The kid hands him money.
          TJ stands and watches. The kid leaves.

          Hesher shoves the money in his pocket, ignoring TJ. He unzips
          his fly and turns to urinate in the bowl.
                         
                          TJ
           What are you doing here?

                          HESHER
           I'm putting out a fire.
                         
          TJ notices that he isn't actually urinating in the bowl. He's
          spraying his pee all over the seat and the lid and the wall and
          the floor. He finishes and zips up. He turns and shoves past TJ.
                         
          Hesher looks at his hair in the mirror, then exits. TJ watches
          him leave, frustrated. He follows him out.
                         
          INT. FAIR OAKS HIGH SCHOOL / HALL - CONTINUOUS
                         
          TJ sees Hesher disappear through the crowd. From behind, TJ is
          grabbed and dragged back into the bathroom.
                         
          INT. FAIR OAKS HIGH SCHOOL / BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          TJ is swung by his backpack across the bathroom. His backpack
          gets ripped off him and he goes down, sliding across the pissy
          floor. He looks up. It's Dustin, seriously angry. TJ leaps up
          and shoves Dustin back. Dustin stumbles backwards and trips over
          TJ's bag in the middle of the bathroom floor.
                         
          Dustin falls and lands on his ass. He flounders embarrassingly.
          TJ knows he's a dead man.
                         
          Dustin jumps up and grabs TJ by the back of his head. He shoves
          TJ's face down onto the filthy urinal tray. TJ struggles.
                         
                          DUSTIN
           You fucked my car, you little prick.
                         
          Dustin holds TJ's head down in the tray. He shoves his face into
          the little yellow urinal deodorizer cake.
                         
                          DUSTIN (CONT'D)
           Eat the cake.
                         
          TJ goes to lift himself up. Dustin punches him and then stands,
          putting his foot on TJ's neck, jamming TJ's head into the tray.
          He pushes the flusher. The urinal flushes all over TJ's face.

          Hesher comes back into the bathroom. Dustin turns and looks at
          him, sensing danger. TJ looks up from the bathroom floor, eyes
          pleading for help. Hesher walks calmly towards TJ and Dustin.
          But instead of saving TJ, he walks straight past them and into
          the stall where he just completed his drug deal.
                         
          He grabs his cigarette lighter from the top of toilet tank. He
          lights a cigarette, takes a long drag, blows the smoke in the
          air and walks back out again. Dustin watches him go. He puts
          another boot into TJ.
                         
                          DUSTIN (CONT'D)

          TJ waits with his bike in the street outside the school. He's
          beat up, wet and dirty. School's out. Most kids have already
          left. Dad pulls up in Grandma's maroon Buick. He gets out and
          opens the back door for TJ's bike.

          TJ and Dad sit on beanbags set out in a circle of about 12.
          Eight of these beanbags have people sitting on them - adults and
          a few kids. Some drink tea and coffee from little styrofoam
          cups. The tone is sombre. Dad and TJ look unsure of themselves.
          The chairperson of the meeting is MERYL, a 42 year-old grief
          counsellor.

           OK, so welcome everyone to the
           Transformational Grief Group. My name
           is Meryl. We should start off by going
           around the circle and introducing
           ourselves and briefly explaining why
           we are here. Hi Miss, would you please
           start us off?
                         
          A heavy set woman, COLEEN, and her husband, JACK, sit on
          beanbags looking pale and sad.
                         
                          COLEEN
           We are the Bolder family. I am Coleen
           and this is my husband Jack. Our
           daughter Cynthia was murdered last
           year.
           (she chokes a bit)
           She was the victim of a violent attack
           that was unfair and sick.
                         
          She can't go on. Her husband Jack sets his hand on her shoulder.
          She is able to hold back the tears.

           We are here because we need help. We
           lost our baby and we are broken.

           Hi, my name is Jack. As my wife said,
           we're here hoping for some answers and
           just some help with the pain.
                         
                          MERYL
           Thank you, Coleen and Jack. Welcome.
                         
          Weird silence.

           Sir.
                         
          Dad shuffles in his seat, looks around the group.

           Ah, OK. Sure. My name is Paul Forney.
           This is my son, TJ. We're here today
           because we lost my wife, TJ's mother,
           a bit more than two months ago now.
           And ah, I don't know, we're still
           trying to come to terms with things
           and, you know, just find some guidance
           of some kind, I guess, and, ah, yeah,
           so...
                         
          Dad finishes mid-sentence, then brief silence.
                         
                          MERYL
           OK, great. Welcome, Paul. TJ? Would
           you like to introduce yourself, say a
           few words to the group?
                         
                          TJ
           Not really.
                         
          Meryl waits to see if TJ has anything more to add. He doesn't.
                         
                          MERYL
           OK. That's OK.
           (to the person next to TJ)
           Nicholas, would you like to introduce
           yourself to the group?
                         
          EXT. FORNEY HOUSE / DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
                         
          Dad and TJ pull into the driveway of the Forney house. Hesher's
          van is parked haphazardly on the lawn. TJ looks at it with venom
          - a reminder of the afternoon.
                         
          INT. FORNEY HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          TJ bursts through the front door.
                         
          He walks through the TV room to the laundry room. He rips open
          the door to the garage and flicks on the light. It's empty
          except for a little pile of Hesher's stuff.
                         
          He walks back through the living room as Dad walks in through
          the front door, closing it behind him.
                         
          TJ heads to the kitchen.
                         
          INT. FORNEY HOUSE / KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
                         
          TJ enters the kitchen. Grandma is baking.

           Hi, honey. How was your special group?
                         
                          TJ
           Fine.
                         
          TJ exits the kitchen. He walks the hall to the bathroom. He
          turns the handle and enters.
                         
          INT. FORNEY HOUSE / BATHROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Hesher is having a bubble bath, smoking a cigarette, totally
          calm. TJ immediately lets rip.
                         
                          TJ
           Fuck you!
                         
                          HESHER
           Fuck you.
                         
                          TJ
           Fuck you. You let that fuck stick my
           head in a toilet and you don't do
           anything about it? You stand there and
           fucking watch him do it?
                         
          Hesher ignores TJ. He watches him closely. He calmly takes a
          drag of his cigarette and ashes into the bath.
                         
                          TJ (CONT'D)
           You stay in my grandma's house? You're
           taking a bath in my fucking grandma's
           bath?
                         
          Hesher flicks his butt in the bath and pulls the plug. He stays
          reclined as the water starts gurgling down the drain.
                         
          Hesher stands. He's totally naked. He doesn't care. TJ waits for
          him to say something. Anything.
                         
          Hesher steps out of the bath, dripping wet, naked.
                         
                          TJ (CONT'D)
           Say something!
                         
          TJ shoves him. Hesher, in a flash, grabs TJ by throat and slams
          him against the wall. He holds him there for a second, staring
          at him intensely.
                         
                          HESHER
                          (CALM)
           Listen to me.

           you're gonna meet me in my van.
                         
          Hesher lets go of TJ and walks out of the bathroom naked.
                         
          INT. HESHER'S VAN - NIGHT
                         
          TJ and Hesher drive through the dark streets of Fair Oaks.
          Hesher finishes a cigarette. Wind blows in his hair. The van
          rattles. The Sex Pistol's 'Anarchy in the UK' is blasting. TJ is
          still angry.
                         
                          TJ
           Where are we going?
                         
          Hesher ignores him.
                         
                          TJ (CONT'D)
           Where are we going?
                         
          After a beat, TJ turns the music down.
                         
                          HESHER
           Touch my stereo again, I'll seriously
           fucking hurt you.
                         
          Hesher turns the music back up. TJ is confused.
                         
          Hesher drives into a gas station and pulls on the handbrake. He
          lights another cigarette.
                         
          EXT. GAS STATION / VAN - CONTINUOUS

           What are we doing?
                         
          Hesher gets out of the van and slams the door shut. He goes
          around the back of the van and opens the back doors. He pulls
          something out and shuts the doors again.
                         
          Through the side-view mirror, TJ can see Hesher filling up a big
          beat-up plastic gas container. He continues to smoke.
                         
          INT. HESHER'S VAN - LATER
                         
          Hesher brings the van to a quiet halt across the street from a
          suburban house. He kills the engine and surveys the area.
                         
          TJ has no idea where they are.
                         
                          TJ
           What are we -

          TJ catches himself asking questions, but stops himself mid-
          sentence. He looks out the window and across the street and sees
          Dustin Howard's YELLOW MUSTANG parked in the drive.
                         
                          TJ (CONT'D)
                          (OH SHIT)
           What are you doing?
                         
          Hesher smiles to himself - he's looking forward to this. He
          opens the van door and climbs out. TJ is in a quiet panic.
                         
          EXT. DUSTIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Hesher opens the van's back doors and grabs the container of
          gasoline. TJ appears beside him, still panicked.
                         
                          TJ
           Hey, seriously. What are you doing?
                         
          Hesher makes his way across the street toward the house and the
          yellow Mustang.
                         
          He pours gasoline all over the car. He does this with confidence
          - he's clearly had some practice.
                         
                          TJ (CONT'D)
           (loud whisper - too loud)
           Come on. This is insane. Let's get out
           of here.
                         
          Hesher ignores him and continues dousing the car with gas.
                         
          The porch light comes on. Someone peels open the front window
          curtains and looks out. TJ and Hesher drop to the ground behind
          the Mustang. TJ is terrified. He looks over to Hesher who is
          smiling, in his element, this is the happiest we have seen him.
                         
          The curtains close but the porch light stays on. Unfazed, Hesher
          hops back up and empties the gas can onto the Mustang.
                         
          Hesher stands a moment, admiring the car, saying a silent
          goodbye to it perhaps, as he pulls a single bent cigarette from
          his pocket.
                         
          He straightens it, then lights it with a match.
                         
                          TJ (CONT'D)
                          (QUIETLY FRANTIC)
           C'mon, man. Let's just go.
                         
          Hesher takes one long drag on the cigarette, then calmly flicks
          the still lit match onto the Mustang.

          Instantly, it erupts in flames.
                         
          Hesher picks up the gas can and walks calmly back to the van. TJ
          follows still franticly looking back at the car and the house.
                         
          Hesher gets in the van and throws the gas can into the back.
                         
          TJ goes to the passenger door.
                         
          It's locked. He wrestles the handle, panicking.
                         
                          TJ (CONT'D)
           Open the door! It's locked!
                         
          Hesher starts the van and pulls away, leaving TJ stranded in the
          street.
                         
          The front door of the house opens and a woman appears on the
          porch. Discovering the car in flames, she screams.
                         
          TJ takes off, running across the street and through a neighbor's
          yard, down the side of the neighbor's house, with the woman on
          the porch screaming at him.
                         
                          WOMAN
           Hey, get back here!
                         
          EXT. STREETS & BACKYARDS - NIGHT
                         
          TJ runs. He jumps fences and slips down the sides of houses.
          He's running fast and breathing hard.
                         
          He finds his way out onto another dark and quiet street.
                         
          He stops. He has no idea where he is or where to go.
                         
          Then - HEADLIGHTS appear at the end of the street. They bear
          down on him slowly. TJ stands immobile. He can now see it is
          Hesher's van, approaching slow and menacing.
                         
          The van stops about 10 feet from TJ. A moment's stand off.
                         
          Then Hesher sticks his head out the window.
                         
                          HESHER
           Get in.

          Hesher revs the engine some more. TJ still doesn't move.
                         
          Hesher FLOORS THE VAN.
                         
          ON TJ - the headlights of the van bear down on him.
                         
          Hesher slams on the brakes and the van screeches to a halt
          inches from TJ's nose. TJ doesn't flinch.
                         
          He and Hesher stare at each other through the windshield.
                         
          Hesher smiles. He's impressed.
                         
          TJ walks around to the passenger door.
                         
          INT. HESHER'S VAN - CONTINUOUS
                         
          TJ climbs in the passenger seat of the van. He's surly.
                         
                          TJ
           What the fuck's wrong with you?!
                         
                          HESHER
           What?
                         
                          TJ
           What's wrong with you?
                         
                          HESHER
           What's the problem? That's the guy who
           put you in the toilet.
                         
                          TJ
           Yeah, but -
                         
          Hesher suddenly freezes, looks round, motions for TJ to 'shhh'.
                         
                          HESHER
                          (WHISPERS)
           Something's coming.
                         
          TJ looks around everywhere. What's coming?
                         
          Then Hesher lets out a FART. He laughs. He puts the van in gear
          and drives. He cranks up the music.
                         
          TJ stares at Hesher for a moment, then looks straight ahead
          shaking his head.
           48.

          TJ wakes in bed, still shell-shocked from the previous night. He
          sits up and rubs his eyes.
                         
          INT. FORNEY HOUSE / BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          TJ stands at the sink and begins to brush his teeth.
                         
          He hears the DOORBELL RING.
                         
          He hears muffled voices outside.
                         
          INT. FORNEY HOUSE / HALL - CONTINUOUS
                         
          TJ exits the bathroom, still brushing and walks the hall toward
          the voices. Hesher is standing shirtless in the front doorway
          eating a banana, blocking the view to outside.
                         
          As TJ nears the front door, Hesher turns and moves away to
          reveal Grandma talking to two uniformed police officers.
                         
                          HESHER
           It's for you.
                         
          Hesher disappears back into the house, smiling at TJ as he
          passes.

          TJ turns. His Dad is now sitting up on the couch, blinking in
          the light. He's in his boxers. His hair's a mess. He's dopey.
          He's just woken up.
                         
          Hesher emerges from the kitchen, heading back to the garage,
          carrying a glass of orange juice.

          TJ's FINGERPRINTS are taken.
                         
          TJ and his Dad sit in an interview room. Dad looks confused,
          dopey and dishevelled. A uniformed police officer enters with a
          file. He shuts the door and sits.

           But I didn't do anything.

           You hearing me here? These are very
           serious crimes we've been presented
           with. Let's just say someone had been
           in that car, and they'd burned - to
           death. We'd be talking about
           manslaughter, possibly murder. Have
           you thought about that? You'd be
           sitting here with detectives from
           Homicide right now. These are felony
           offences we're talking about, son.
           Serious jail-time offences.

          for a little while. Then dad speaks-
                         
                          DAD
           Did you do it?
                         
          TJ pauses before answering.
                         
                          TJ
           Not really.
                         
                          DAD

           What does `not really' mean?
                         
          TJ ignores him, stares out the car window.
                         
                          DAD (CONT'D)
           Tell me what `not really' means.
                         
                          TJ
           It means I didn't do it.
                         
                          DAD
           No, it doesn't. Why would you say 'not
           really'?
                         
                          TJ

           You did. I heard you.
                         
                          TJ
           I said I didn't do it.
                         
                          DAD
           Yeah, before that. I asked if you did
           it. You said `not really'.
                         
                          TJ
           I can't remember what I said.

          Dad pulls the car into the driveway and comes to an abrupt stop.
          Hesher is sitting in a lawn chair in the middle of the driveway,
          sunbathing with his shirt off, drinking beer. He has a farmer's
          tan.
                         
          TJ jumps out. Dad stares at Hesher from inside the car.

          TJ is hiding, peering down an aisle, watching Nicole working at
          the check out scanning groceries. A can falls from one of the

          one falls. He steps along the shelf to where the cans fell. He
          looks through to the next aisle. Nothing. Then a voice from
          behind him.
                         
                          HESHER
           Do you think she is totally bald or do
           you think she's more of a landing
           strip kind of chick or more of a 70's
           jungle bitch.
                         
          TJ is startled. Hesher stands behind him, also watching Nicole.
                         
                          TJ
           What are doing here?
                         
                          HESHER
           You're stalking that chick, dude.
                         
                          TJ
           No, I'm not.
                         
                          HESHER
           Yeah, you are. I've been stalking you
           for half an hour. You gonna try to
           fuck her?
                         
                          TJ
           What? No.
                         
                          HESHER
           Can't fuck her from here, dude. Gotta
           be way closer.
                         
                          TJ
           Shut up about it.
                         
                          HESHER
           You wanna poke her clam?

          TJ is freaked and embarrassed. He walks away down the aisle.
          Hesher follows.
                         
                          HESHER
           You wanna poke her clam or what?
                         
                          TJ
           Please stop saying that.
                         
          TJ walks ahead fast. He wants out of this conversation.
                         
          Nicole finishes up, turns her light off and hangs a 'Check Stand
          Closed' sign. She walks off toward the back of the store. TJ
          stops to be sure to avoid her.
                         
                          HESHER
           You want to poke her clam, dude.
           Nothing wrong with that. Don't be
           ashamed about it. Humans have been
           poking vagina for hundreds of years.
           Longer even.
                         
          Hesher says this a little too loud. Nearby shoppers look over.
          TJ shakes his head, then exits the store. Hesher follows.
                         
                          HESHER (CONT'D)
           Bro, there's nothing wrong with
           wanting a little pussy.

          TJ unlocks his bike from a pole.
                         
                          HESHER

                          TJ
           No thanks.
                         
                          HESHER
           OK, but if you come with me it'll take
           5 minutes and if you ride it will take
           you about 15.
                         
          TJ gets onto his bike.

          TJ clearly doesn't want to ride his bike home, but his is
          reluctant to go with Hesher.
                         
                          TJ
           Fine, just don't talk to me.

          Hesher closes the back doors and they get in.

          He waits a beat for TJ to respond. TJ is still mad, he says
          nothing.
                         
                          HESHER (CONT'D)
           That was totally out of control.
           Foolish and irresponsible actually.
                         
          TJ looks at Hesher, doubting his sincerity.
                         
                          HESHER (CONT'D)
           I want you to have this -
                         
          Hesher reaches into the back of the van and picks up a dirty
          magazine. He flips through some pages and shows TJ a photo.
                         
          TJ pushes the magazine away, disgusted.
                         
                          TJ
           Get that away from me.

          Nicole drives through the parking lot. Hesher follows her out of

          Hesher bobs his head in time with a heavy metal track that
          blasts from the stereo.
                         
          TJ is ignoring Hesher, looking straight ahead at Nicole's car.
          Nicole stops at a red light behind another car. Hesher pulls up
          behind her and starts playing air drums to the track.
                         
          The light turns green. Nicole hits the gas, running straight
          into the back of the car in front which hadn't started moving
          yet.

           Whoops.
                         
          TJ's first impulse is to duck. Hesher watches the road. We hear
          the sounds of an angry DRIVER yelling at Nicole.
                         
          Through the windscreen we see the guy get out of his car,
          yelling at Nicole.

           Your sexy girlfriend's in trouble.
           We're not going anywhere.
                         
          Hesher gets out. TJ ducks. He can't see what's going on. Long
          seconds pass. And then his door opens.
                         
          Hesher is standing there next to Nicole.
                         
                          HESHER (CONT'D)
           You know, TJ?
                         
          This is now beyond embarrassing for TJ. He can't even think
          straight.
                         
                          TJ
           Hey.
                         
          EXT. FAIR OAKS STREET - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          TJ and Hesher push Nicole's car off to the side of the road.
                         
          INT. HESHER'S VAN - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Hesher drives. Nicole's in the passenger seat shaken by the turn
          her day has taken. TJ is in the back.
                         
                          NICOLE
           Sometimes, you know, a day is bad and
           then when you think it couldn't get
           any worse you suddenly discover whole
           new ways it can get worse.
                         
          Hesher reaches over her and pulls a joint from the glove
          compartment. He lights the joint and takes a big toke. He offers
          it to Nicole.
                         
                          NICOLE (CONT'D)
           No, thanks.
                         
          Hesher shrugs and takes another big toke then offers it to TJ
          who also declines.

           This one time I had like four hella
           drunk chicks in the back of the van,
           and we were going for it and I had one
           hand on this one girl's tit and my
           other hand on this other chick's twat,
           but there was like still two other
           girls wanting to get off so like I had
           my foot rubbing on one girl's asshole
           while I'm trying to eat the other girl
           out, and I was going crazy man. It was
           too much. I couldn't work out which
           chick was which and I'm making one
           girl cum but then I'm forgetting about
           the others and my tongue's hurting and
           my fingers are getting tired and like
           eventually I was just like 'Fuck this.
           This is too much' and I just stepped
           back. I just stepped back. And before
           you know it these girls are all
           working on each other, you know.
           They're all fingering each other and
           eating each other out, you know, and I
           jerk myself off and everyone's a
           winner, you know?
                         
          Nicole looks at Hesher like he's crazy. TJ is in the back - he
          can't believe what's coming out of Hesher's mouth. A moment
          passes.
                         
                          NICOLE
           Was that some kind of perverted
           metaphor for me? About how I should
           just step back and let things work
           themselves out?
                         
                          HESHER
           A what?
                         
          He reaches for the stereo and cranks the knob - Metallica's,
          'Motorbreath' BLASTS through the speakers.
                         
          As if he were possessed by the music, Hesher veers dangerously
          off the road onto a dirt patch. He has a crazed look in his
          eyes. TJ and Nicole grab onto anything they can hold onto.
                         
          Hesher turns the wheel hard and floors the gas. The van spins in
          circles spraying dirt in every direction. TJ gets thrown from
          the back seat onto the ground. Dirt pours into the windows and
          covers them from head to toe. Hesher corrects the wheel and
          veers back onto the road again.

          UB40's 'Red Red Wine' plays. A car honks as an angry driver
          passes.

           What the hell was that?
                         
          Hesher looks over at Nicole.
                         
                          HESHER
           I saw a mouse.

           What?
                         
          TJ picks himself up off the van's floor, dusting himself off.

           I have dirt in my mouth.
                         
          TJ scrapes his tongue with his fingers. Nicole breaks a little
          smile.
                         
          EXT. SUBURBAN HOME - DAY
                         
          The black van pulls up curb-side outside a neat suburban home.
          Hesher gets out and walks, covered in dirt, to the front door of
          the house. He looks in through the window, knocks, waits. An old
          man opens the door. They exchange a few words. Hesher heads back
          to the van and they drive off. Nicole and TJ seem confused.
                         
                          NICOLE
           Who's that guy?
                         
          Hesher says nothing. They drive three houses down the street and
          stop again. Hesher gets out. Again he peers in the window,
          knocks on the door. This time no answer. He heads back to the
          van. Nicole and TJ watch him approach from inside. He sticks his
          head in.
                         
                          HESHER
           We're here. Come on, let's go.
                         
                          NICOLE

          TJ climb out of the van and follow Hesher. Nicole seems
          cautious. TJ knows he's on an adventure.
                         
          Hesher jumps the SIDE GATE, then opens it for the others.

          EXT. SUBURBAN HOME / BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          In the backyard is a swimming pool.
                         
          Nicole and TJ stand looking in the pool. It's a nice pool with a
          diving board.
                         
          Hesher walks up behind them and pushes them in.
                         
          Nicole comes up for air.
                         
                          NICOLE
           What the fuck!?
                         
                          HESHER
           What? You're dirty.
                         
                          NICOLE
           Yeah, and now I'm wet.
                         
          Hesher smiles wide.
                         
                          HESHER
           You're dirty and wet. I'm coming in...
                         
          He throws his T-shirt off and does a huge bomb into the pool.
                         
                          HESHER (CONT'D)
           Now I'm dirty and wet too.
                         
          He splashes water at her. He dives under the water. Suddenly TJ
          is pulled under. Nicole can't see them under all the motion.
          Then TJ and Hesher come bursting up for air.

           compactors on the detention level!
                         
          Hesher dives under the water again. Nicole squirms. Hesher has
          her leg. He doesn't drag her under. He just tugs her leg. She
          slaps at the water. He tugs her leg again. Pretty soon she's
          laughing. Hesher's head appears above water momentarily.
                         
                          HESHER (CONT'D)
           ...All the fucking trash compactors...
           (underwater, then up again)
           ...on the detention level!...
                         
          He dives again. He pulls her leg. She laughs hard. TJ watches
          feeling a little left out. Hesher jumps up and climbs out of the
          pool. He goes to a garden table nearby.
                         
                          HESHER (CONT'D)
           Oh, shit. More trash coming in!
                         
          He heaves the table over and into the pool. He grabs a banana
          lounge.
                         
                          HESHER (CONT'D)
           Oh shit!
                         
          He throws it in the pool. Nicole and TJ have to dive out of the
          way. They go to the sides of the pool and climb out laughing,
          while Hesher continues heaving garden furniture, a barbecue and
          anything else in reach into the water.
                         
          TJ and Nicole sit on the edge of the pool with their legs
          dangling in the water. They're fully clothed and soaking wet.
                         
          He walks off, around the side of the house, looking for more
          things to break.
                         
          There is an awkward silent moment between TJ and Nicole. TJ
          looks down and notices a small army of ants marching along the
          side of the pool. He manages to get one to crawl onto the his
          finger.
                         
                          NICOLE

           No, not really, I don't know, it's
           kinda a long story.
                         
          TJ flicks the ant off of his finger, then another one that's
          climbing up his arm.
                         
                          NICOLE
           Do you realize that the equivalent to
           you flicking that ant would be like
           one of us getting hit in the face by a
           giant wrecking ball at 100 miles an
           hour and getting thrown into the next
           yard?
                         
          TJ stops mid ant flicking.
                         
                          TJ

           Do you think the other ants are gonna

           think their gonna miss her?
                         
          TJ doesn't know how to answer.
                         
          Hesher reappears with a container of lighter fluid and goes to
          the diving board. He climbs on and squirts the lighter fluid
          through his lighter, sending streams of flames into the pool.
                         
          Hesher douses the diving board with lighter fluid and ignites it
          with his lighter. The diving board erupts into flames.

          Hesher takes a few steps back then runs toward the board. He
          springs through the flames into the air. He does a messy
          sideways flip.
                         
                          HESHER (CONT'D)
           FUCK YOU BITCHES!!!

          He lands in the pool splashing TJ and Nicole. He pulls himself
          out and shakes his hair around like a wet dog. He looks over at
          the flaming diving board.
                         
                          HESHER (CONT'D)
           Shit, look at that.
                         
          Hesher grabs his shirt on his way toward the fence. He doesn't
          look back.
                         
                          HESHER (CONT'D)
           I got a doctor's appointment.
                         
                          TJ
           What?
                         
          Hesher hops over the fence.
                         
           HESHER (O.S.)
                          (YELLS)
           It burns when I urinate...
                         
          Hesher disappears over the fence. We hear his van start and peel
          away.
                         
          The flaming diving board pours black toxic smoke into the sky as
          it crumbles into the pool.
                         
                          NICOLE
           Did he just leave us? I think we
           should get out of here.
                         
          Nicole stands and heads for the gate, TJ tags behind. They jump
          the side fence and head out into the street, dripping wet.
                         
          EXT. FAIR OAKS STREET - LATE AFTERNOON
                         
          TJ & Nicole walk over the crest of a small hill on a tree-lined
          street eating ice-cream cones. They walk in the middle of the
          road, still damp. The sun is setting. The light is magical.
                         
                          TJ
           My shoes are so squishy.
                         
          TJ steps hard, squirting water out the sides of his wet shoes.
          Nicole smiles.
                         
                          NICOLE

           That was so lucky you guys were behind
           me when that guy got all mad about his
           car. I was freaking out. I don't
           really have any insurance right now. I
           just can't afford it. There's no way I
           could afford to fix that guy's car.
           How do people do this stuff? I mean, I
           have a job. It's kind of a joke
           though. I've been there for like a
           year and I'm still only doing like
           five hours a week. Why aren't they
           giving me any more hours? Do you think
           it's because they think I suck? Did
           you think I sucked when I served you
           at the checkout?

          EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON
                         
          A parking ticket sits under the wiper on Nicole's windshield. TJ
          and Nicole approach the car, smiling - and then Nicole sees the
          ticket. Her face sinks immediately.
                         
                          NICOLE
           Oh, no. Please tell me that's not a
           ticket...
                         
          She runs the last few steps to the car and rips the ticket from
          under the wiper. She reads it quick.
                         
                          NICOLE (CONT'D)
           Fuck, fuck, fuck it.
                         
          She paces a couple of angry circles and then kicks the car's
          tire. It hurts her foot. She yelps.
                         
                          NICOLE (CONT'D)
           Ah, shit. Fuck it.
                         
          In a small frenzy, she pulls her keys from her pocket and opens
          the car door. She gets in and slams the door behind her. She
          sits behind the wheel and yells, frustrated.
                         
          TJ stands in the street, uncomfortable, not knowing what to do.
          He goes to the car and gets in beside her. He sits, still not
          knowing what to say. She tries to settle herself, but she's
          still very emotional.
                         
                          NICOLE (CONT'D)
           What have I done to deserve this chain

           Sometimes I wonder if I were to die
           right now, if anyone would care, or
           even notice.

          TJ thinks a moment. It's a sweet and sour moment. He wants to
          cheer Nicole up, but he's remembering his Mom at the same time.
                         
                          TJ (CONT'D)

          Nicole sniffs, smiling through her tears.

          She puts the key in the ignition and turns it. Nothing. Nicole
          takes a breath - not wanting to get upset again. She turns to TJ
          and smiles sadly.

           Fine. Fuck this.
                         
          TJ sweeps his plate off the table. It goes crashing onto the
          kitchen floor, food everywhere. Grandma walks back into the
          room, looking worried. Hesher seems riveted, like he's watching
          the tennis.
                         
          And then Dad sweeps his plate off the table. Crash, food, mess.
          He glares back at TJ.
                         
                          DAD

          Dad sits a moment. With TJ gone, his reproach turns to shame.
          Grandma and Hesher make eye contact with each other.
                         
          Dad gets up and leaves the kitchen.
                         
          Hesher shovels some more food into his mouth. Grandma looks
          concerned.
                         
                          GRANDMA
           Did I miss something?
                         
                          HESHER
                          (MOUTH FULL)
           Not really. Paul came in and said some
           dumb shit which TJ got angry about and
           so TJ smashed his plate and then Paul
           smashed his plate too but I got a
           feeling he smashed his one cuz he
           couldn't actually think of anything to
           say cuz he kinda knew TJ had a point
           and so now he feels bad about it and
           so he's gone somewhere.
           (takes another mouthful)
           I don't know where.
                         
          Grandma contemplates this.
                         
                          GRANDMA
           Those boys have been through a lot.
                         
          This makes Grandma very sad.
                         
                          GRANDMA (CONT'D)
           Sometimes I wonder if they're ever
           gonna smile again
                         
          Tears well in Grandma's eyes. Grandma is quietly crying.
                         
                          GRANDMA (CONT'D)
           I just wish there was something more I
           could do.
                         
          A long beat passes.
                         
          Hesher doesn't know what to say. He pours applesauce on his
          food. Grandma looks around the kitchen at the mess. She shakes
          her head, takes a deep breath and starts cleaning up. She picks
          up bits of broken plate and takes them to the sink. Hesher
          watches her.
                         
                          HESHER

          Hesher holds up a piece of bacon covered in applesauce and licks
          off the sauce.
                         
                          HESHER

           Oh, OK.
                         
          Grandma exits. Hesher finishes the last few bites of his dinner.
          He notices Dad's pill bottle. He reaches for them. He unscrews
          the lid and empties a few into his hand. He swallows the pills.

          cigarette.

           They're medical cigarettes that help

                          HESHER (CONT'D)
           No shit.

           I'll be right back.
                         
          Hesher dashes out of Grandma's room.
                         
          After a few moments, he comes back and sits on the edge of the
          bed. He is holding a glass BONG. The bong has so much resin
          caked onto the sides, it looks as though a thousand pounds of
          marijuana have been smoked through it.

          half and loads the bowl of the pipe.
                         
                          GRANDMA

                          HESHER
           It's a bong. The water filters the
           smoke. It's probably the most healthy
           way to smoke weed.
                         
          Hesher lights up and takes a HUGE hit from the bong. He explains
          his technique to Grandma while holding the smoke in.
                         
                          HESHER (CONT'D)
           OK, so basically cover the hole here
           with your thumb then suck on the top
           and once the chamber fills with smoke,
           take your finger off the hole and suck
           in.
                         
          Hesher takes a quick sip of air sucking the smoke deeper into
          his lungs.
                         
                          HESHER (CONT'D)
           Then try and hold the smoke in for as
           long as possible, OK bro?
                         
                          GRANDMA
           Umm, OK.
                         
          Grandma takes the bong and has a hit. It's a bit clunky, but she
          manages to make it work.
                         
                          HESHER
           Ok, lift your finger.
                         
          Hesher helps her. The smoke shoots into her lungs. Grandma
          begins to cough.
                         
                          GRANDMA
           Oh, wow... That was a big one.
                         
                          HESHER
           Yeah, that was good. Hit it again.
                         
          Grandma has another hit. It goes well. She blows out the smoke.
                         
          Hesher takes the bong off her and has another HUGE one for
          himself. He passes the bong back.

          Hesher takes the last hit. He dusts off the bowl and sets the
          water pipe down.
                         
          They sit for a moment and let the drug sink in.

           Oh, stop it. Aren't you a little old
           to be hanging around TJ all the time?

                          GRANDMA
           No, I'm his grandmother.
                         
                          HESHER
           Yeah, I guess you have a point... OK,
           well I used to have a mouse. No,
           wait... hang on a minute. I used to
           have a snake. And do you know what
           snakes eat?
                         
                          GRANDMA
           Actually, there's no limit to the food
           items that you can even think of that
           a snake might eat. Whatever is
           available in abundance would become
           the prey for the snakes. Depending on
           their growth, their diet -
                         
          Hesher cuts her off.
                         
                          HESHER
           Yeah, OK, OK well, actually they eat
           mice.

                          GRANDMA
           They do eat mice. A lot of times
           snakes eat other snakes because
           they're the right shape -
                         
                          HESHER
           Yeah, OK, well anyway... I used to
           have a snake and I fed it mice. But
           one time I fed this little fuckin'
           mouse to my snake and that mouse was
           tough. I dropped that mouse in the
           snake's tank and the snake wouldn't go
           near him, and any time he tried that
           mouse would just smack him with his
           little, you know...
                         
          Hesher looks at his hand, not knowing what mouse hands are
          called.
                         
                          HESHER (CONT'D)
           With his little mouse hand. So instead
           of eating the mouse the snake just
           curled up crying in the corner and the
           mouse ruled that fuckin' cage. And
           this went on for weeks, the snake
           wouldn't go near him. That tiny mouse
           used to sit in a little miniature lawn
           chair scratching his balls and
           shelling peanuts and this snake was
           just too scared to go near it. And cuz
           the snake was scared of that mouse I
           had to feed him other mice, but every
           time I dropped another mouse in the
           tank, it'd hide behind the brave
           mouse. And so eventually the snake
           starved to death. I had a cage full of
           mice.

          and takes a long, slow drag, as he crouches down and starts
          picking up pieces of broken plate from the pile.

          TJ nimbly reaches down to the table, covered with dirty dishes
          and pill bottles, and quietly picks up his dad's wallet. He
          removes an ATM card and places the wallet back where it was. He

          TJ coasts down the hill of a tree-lined street. He's upset and
          trying hard to hold it back.
                         
          EXT. FORNEY HOUSE / FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          TJ drops his bike and enters the house.
                         
          INT. FORNEY HOUSE / FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Dad sits on the couch, his head in his hands. He looks up.
                         
                          DAD
           Teej.
                         
          Hesher enters the room...
                         
                          HESHER
           FUCK!
                         
          He punches a hold in the wall. He paces angrily back & forth.
          Dad, holding back tears, gets up off the coach and hugs TJ.
                         
                          TJ
           What's going on?
                         
                          DAD
           Teej. Grandma, she's not.. she's not
           waking up.
                         
                          TJ
           What!?
                         
                          DAD
           She won't wake up.
                         
          Short fast heavy breathing sets in.
                         
                          TJ
           What do you mean?
                         
          TJ runs over to Grandma's room and stops at the door.
                         
                          TJ (CONT'D)
           Oh, Jesus.

          He disappears into the room for a second then emerges again in
          tears, his hands on his face. He heads back to the living room.
                         
                          TJ (CONT'D)
           What happened?
                         
                          DAD
           I don't know, she just, she just
           didn't wake up.
                         
          TJ is in shock. He sits on the couch next to dad. They are both
          lost for words. Hesher stands in the corner with his head shoved
          between the walls.
                         
          Hesher joins TJ and Dad on the couch. They are all raging
          inside, confused, lost and upset. They sit together in silence
          for a long beat, in the same boat for the first time.
                         
          Hesher breaks the silence. He kicks the table over as he stands.
                         
                          HESHER
           I gotta get the fuck out of here
           before I hurt someone.
                         
          He leaves through the front door, leaving it open behind him.
                         
          TJ gets up in a daze and stands at the doorway looking out. It
          has started to drizzle.
                         
          INT. FORNEY HOUSE / GRANDMA'S BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          TJ stands in the doorway working up the nerve to enter.
                         
          He enters and leans down to Grandma and tries to lift her onto
          the bed. She is heavy for him, he struggles.
                         
          He gets her on top of the bed and looks at her for a moment.
                         
          TJ breaks into tears. He leans down onto the bed holding
          Grandma, crying into her chest.
                         
          INT. FORNEY HOUSE / TJ'S ROOM - DAY
                         
          TJ sits on his bed and looks inside the envelope of cash. He
          closes it and seals it shut. On the front he writes: 'NICOLE'S
          PARKING TICKET FUND. LOVE TJ.'

           Hi, it's Nicole. I'm not in right now,
           but leave a message and I'll call you
           back.

                          TJ
           Ah, hi. It's TJ here. I, ah, I'm sorry
           to bug you, but um, I don't know, I
           guess I wanted to talk to you right
           now. I don't know. I have a present
           for you too, so maybe I'll just come
           drop it off or something, or ah,
           yeah... Um, OK. Bye.
                         
          He hangs up the phone and exits.
                         
          EXT. FORNEY HOUSE - AFTERNOON
                         
          TJ walks out the front door. Dad is quietly sitting on the front
          steps wearing a T-shirt in the light rain. TJ goes to his bike.
                         
                          TJ
           What are you doing?
                         
                          DAD
                          (SNAPPING TO)
           I don't know. Getting some fresh air,
           I guess.
                         
                          TJ
           It's starting to rain.
                         
          Dad reaches out his hand and catches a few drops.
                         
                          DAD
           Yeah.
                         
          TJ picks up his bike and rides. We stay with Dad as TJ
          disappears down the wet street.
                         
          EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON
                         
          TJ rides his bike. He rounds a corner onto Nicole's street.
                         
          He jumps off his bike outside her building and wheels it inside
          the front fence.

          EXT. NICOLE'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON
                         
          TJ climbs the stairs of Nicole's building. As he approaches her
          apartment door, he hears loud, but muffled music.
                         
          He knocks on the door. No answer. The music is really loud.
                         
          He knocks again. No answer. He tries the door handle. It gives.
                         
          He pushes the door open tentatively.
                         
          INT. NICOLE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
                         
          TJ enters the apartment. The music is blasting. He looks around
          the living area. Clothes are strewn around. He sees Hesher's
          combat boots, T-shirt, jeans. TJ looks seriously troubled.
                         
          We can faintly hear heavy breathing/moaning coming from the
          bedroom.
                         
          TJ walks over to a door. It's an inch ajar. He pushes it open
          gently.
                         
          We don't see what he sees, but TJ stands deathly still, eyes
          wide, white as a ghost. We hear Nicole giggle. Then -
                         
           NICOLE (O.S.)
           Oh shit. TJ.
                         
          TJ storms away, heading for the front door. He pulls a lamp
          smashing to the ground on his way out.
                         
          EXT. NICOLE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
                         
          TJ charges down the stairs. He grabs his bike and heads out into
          the street. Light rain falls. We see Hesher appear behind him,
          barefoot and topless, buttoning his jeans.
                         
          TJ notices Hesher's van parked out the front, he drops his bike
          and grabs a rusty pipe from a pile of garbage on the sidewalk
          and heads straight toward the van.
                         
                          HESHER
           Hey, hey... wait.
                         
          TJ takes a hard swing into the van, smashing the tail light.
          Nicole runs out into the street, concerned, wearing an oversized
          sweatshirt and underpants.
                         
                          HESHER (CONT'D)
           Hey! The fuck are you doing?

          TJ ignores him and takes another swing at the van. Hesher
          approaches TJ. TJ takes a swing at him with the pipe.
                         
          Hesher steps back. Nicole gasps, her hand to her mouth. She
          doesn't know what to say or do.
                         
                          TJ
           Fuck you. Fuck you fuck you fuck you.
                         
                          HESHER
           Stop hitting my van.
                         
                          TJ
           Fuck you.
                          (TO NICOLE)
           And you're a fucking whore. I hope you
           die. And when you do, no one's gonna
           fuckin' notice.
                          (BREATHES)
           Cuz you're a fat fucking prostitute.
                         
          Hesher steps toward TJ.
                         
                          HESHER
           Dude, chill out for a second.
                         
          TJ swings the pipe at Hesher again.
                         
                          TJ
           Get the fuck away from me! I'll smash
           you in the face, I swear to God. Back
           the fuck up.
                         
          TJ swings again. He's so angry, he's practically foaming at the
          mouth.
                         
                          TJ (CONT'D)
           I never want to see you or your ugly
           fucking face again. That goes for both
           of you fucking assholes.
                         
          TJ throws the pipe at Hesher. It hits the road with a loud
          clang. TJ grabs his bike and rides away furiously. Hesher and
          Nicole watch TJ ride away. It begins to rain hard.
                         
          EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

          TJ rides up the front porch. A funeral home truck is parked out
          the front - HAPPY EVER AFTER is written on the side. TJ drops
          his bike and enters the house.

          Dad sits at the dining room table with a FUNERAL DIRECTOR - a
          tall, lanky man. He talks in a drawn, soft monotone. Dad doesn't
          appear to be at all in the mood for this conversation.
                         
                          FUNERAL DIRECTOR
           After the service we have

           room, but should you wish to upgrade
           to soda and sandwiches we can arrange
           that. People typically like to have a
           light bite after the service.
                         
          The front door slams. TJ storms past the dining room table. The
          funeral director pauses and watches him pass. The sound of TJ's
          bedroom door slamming shakes the house.
                         
          INT. FORNEY HOUSE / TJ'S ROOM - EVENING
                         
          TJ is angrily pacing back and forth. A gentle knock reveals Dad
          at his door.
                         
                          DAD
           Are you OK?
                         
          TJ refuses to look at his dad.
                         
                          TJ
           Will you just leave me alone.
                         
          Dad doesn't know what to say beyond this. He feels as lost as TJ
          does. He leaves the room.
                         
          TJ paces.
                         
          INT. FORNEY HOUSE / GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          He enters the garage violently. TJ sweeps Hesher's belongings
          off the work bench in the garage. He kicks Hesher's sleeping bag
          and pillow. A weathered bass guitar leans against a little
          amplifier. TJ kicks the guitar, snapping it in two.
                         
          Out of breath, he stands in the mess he has created. Something
          catches his eye. He contemplates this for a beat.

          EXT. FORNEY HOUSE / FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS
                         
          It's raining hard. TJ storms out, just as Hesher is making his
          way up the path, his van parked on the street behind him. Hesher
          reaches out his arm to slow TJ.
                         
                          HESHER
           I wanna talk to you.
                         
          TJ pushes Hesher's arm out of the way.
                         
                          TJ
           Get your fucking hands away from me! I
           told you, I never want to see you
           again.
                         
          Hesher, at a loss, watches TJ grab a brick from the muddy garden
          and throw it through the passenger side window of his van.
                         
          Hesher charges TJ. He throws him into the muddy garden and
          kneels over him holding him by the collar of his hooded
          sweatshirt.
                         
                          HESHER
           I fuckin' told you, leave my van out
           of this!
                         
          Hesher lifts TJ up and slams him back down on the ground,
          knocking the wind out of him. TJ struggles to get away.
                         
                          TJ
           Let go of me! Fuckin' let go of me.
                         
          Dad runs out the front door and pulls Hesher off TJ by the back
          of his shirt.
                         
                          DAD
           What in God's name -
                         
          Hesher shakes free from Dad's grip and punches him square in the
          nose. Dad goes down hard.
                         
                          HESHER
           Don't fuckin' touch m-

          Without hesitation, TJ jumps on Hesher's back, bear hugging his
          face. They struggle for a beat, until Hesher manages to throw TJ
          off. He lands on the wet grass like a ragdoll.
                         
                          HESHER (CONT'D)
           Fuck you both! Motherfuckers!
                         
          Hesher stands breathing hard, dripping wet from the rain, fists
          clenched.
                         
          He turns back to his van, gets in, slams the door and peels
          away. TJ picks himself up out of the mud, grabs his bike and
          rides off in the opposite direction. Dad stands holding his
          bloody nose. He watches Hesher, he watches TJ. He is left
          confused and bleeding in the pouring rain.
                         
          EXT. DUSTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          It's raining cats and dogs. TJ stands outside Dustin's house,
          soaking wet with his hoodie pulled over his head, the garden
          shears in his hand.
                         
          He walks around the side of the house and looks in the window.
                         
          INT. DUSTIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          From TJ's POV outside, we see Dustin in the kitchen preparing a
          sandwich, one eye on the TV. He takes the sandwich to the couch
          in front of the TV and lies down.
                         
          EXT. DUSTIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          TJ walks around the back of the house. He tries the handle to
          the back door. It's locked. TJ sees the dog door. He climbs
          through the flap, trying to be as quiet as possible. The TV is
          loud inside.

          TJ treads softly through the kitchen, soaking wet, shears
          poised.
                         
          He walks through to the living area. He steps behind the couch
          out of Dustin's line of sight. Dustin's bare feet hang off the
          end of the couch.
                         
          TJ ducks down. He opens the shears and carefully brings them
          down over Dustin's big toe. He squeezes them shut...
                         
          Dustin squeals.

           It's gone to the wrecker's.

           Bullshit.
                         
          TJ squeezes a little harder. Dustin squeals a little louder.
                         
                          DUSTIN
           Why would I be lying?

           Because you're a fucking asshole. Tell

          TJ squeezes harder. Dustin squeals.
                         
                          DUSTIN (CONT'D)
           I'm not lying. It went to the wrecking
           yard on Sunrise near Red Bridge,
           yesterday afternoon. It's there now.
                         
          TJ thinks, holding Dustin's toe in his grip.

                          TJ
           If you're lying, I'm gonna cut off
           every one of your fingers.
                         
          TJ doesn't quite know what to do now. He stares at Dustin who
          looks genuinely frightened. TJ releases the shears and backs
          away. And the second he does so, Dustin leaps off the couch,
          grabs TJ by the throat and slams him down on the living room
          floor. TJ drops the shears.
                         
                          DUSTIN
           You finished? Want to tell me
           something else while you're visiting?
                         
          Dustin wails into TJ. TJ cowers on the ground. Punches land
                         UNTIL -
                         
          A LAWN CHAIR comes CRASHING through the front window into the
          living room, raining glass everywhere. Dustin stops punching,
          stunned, and looks up to see Hesher, dripping wet, step through
          the big nasty hole he has just made.
                         
                          HESHER
           Hello.
                         
                          DUSTIN
           What the fuck?
                         
          Dustin moves to stand. Hesher pounces on him, dragging him along
          the ground. He grabs the shears and brings them straight up to
          Dustin's nose. In the same movement, he snaps the shears shut
          and takes the end of Dustin's nose off.
                         
          Dustin squeals in pain and scurries backwards, clutching his
          face, blood leaking between his fingers. TJ stands, stunned.
                         
                          TJ
           What the fuck is wrong with you?

           Only a bit, it's just a cut.
                         
          Dustin is crying now, clutching his face.
                         
          TJ goes to the kitchen.

          TJ runs a rag under the tap and takes it to Dustin. Hesher
          stands, clutching the shears, confused.

           Hold this against your face.
                         
          Dustin moans. Hesher is still confused.
                         
                          TJ (CONT'D)

           What's your problem?
                         
          Dustin holds the rag. TJ stands to face Hesher.

           I want you outta my life. I'm serious.

          They look at each other a moment. Hesher looks taken aback. He
          honestly believed he was doing a good thing.
                         
          TJ leaves, through the front door. Hesher stands over a

          TJ rides his bike over a rickety red bridge. He pulls his bike
          up outside the tall wire fence of a big dirty wrecking yard -
          D&S Auto-Wreckers. It's still raining very hard. TJ is soaking
          wet. He sits on his bike, looking at mountains of wrecked cars
          inside.
                         
          TJ hops off his bike and shoves it behind a dumpster. He gets up
          on the dumpster and climbs the wrecking yard's fence.

          TJ roams the stacks, looking for his mother's car. He looks
          distraught. All around sit stacks of wrecked cars. A vicious dog
          on a chain barks and snarls nearby.
                         
          TJ stops. He sees his mom's car atop a tall stack of wrecks. He
          looks at it a moment, contemplating what to do. He moves to the
          base of the stack and begins to climb.
                         
          He clambers slowly up the pile in the rain. It's awkward and
          difficult and more than a little dangerous.
                         
          Finally he reaches the top. He wrenches open the car door and
          squeezes behind the wheel.

          the car. TJ is up high enough to see the lights of the
          surrounding neighborhood. He sits and contemplates the last few
          days and months of his life.

           OK, pizza's here.
                         
           WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                          (YELLING BACK)
           Alright, let's do it.
                         
          The woman comes down the stairs with her hair nicely done,
          wearing a fancy pink dress, it's TJ's MOM.
                         
                          MOM
           Teej, c'mon sweetheart. We have to go.
           We're going to be late.
                         
                          TJ
           What about the pizza?
                         
                          MOM
           We'll eat it in the car.
                         
          She begins to do up TJ's tie.
                         
                          MOM (CONT'D)
                          (TO DAD)
           Honey, will you grab the present?
                         
          Dad picks up a large box off the side table, it's clearly heavy.
                         
                          DAD
           Holy crap, what is this thing?
                         
          The three emerge from the house. TJ is wearing a suit and
          carrying the pizza box, Dad's carrying the heavy present, and
          Mom's carrying a bouquet of flowers and her purse. Dad stands at
          the door of a little white car. Clearly the box is too big.
                         
                          DAD (CONT'D)
           Ah, slight problem.
                         
          Mom open the back of her red volvo which is parked right next to
          the white car.
                         
                          MOM
           We'll take my car.
                         
          Dad does a heel spins around the white car and heads towards
          Mom's red volvo, never losing a beat.
                         
                          DAD
           Sure thing.

          Dad's driving, eating a slice of pizza. TJ is in the backseat,
          looking out the window, also eating pizza. Mom does her make-up
          in the visor mirror.
                         
                          DAD
           I think we should keep the new one and
           give them our old one.
                         
                          MOM
           That's a great idea. I'll be sure to
           let them know that our dirty old
           microwave is a gift from you.
                         
                          DAD
           Good. I'm not even sure they know who
           I am.
                         
                          MOM
           Honey, they're my friends. Please.
                         
                          DAD
           OK, I just don't understand why they
           get so many presents.
                         
                          MOM
           A microwave and a bottle of scotch is
           hardly a lot of presents.
                         
                          DAD
           And flowers.
                         
          Mom half-laughs and shakes her head.
                         
                          TJ
           (mouth full of pizza)
           Mom can you turn on the radio?
                         
                          MOM
           Sure honey. How about some oldies?
                         
                          TJ
           Oldies but goodies.
                         
          Mom turns on the oldies station. Dion And The Belmont's, "A
          Teenager In Love" plays. Dad sings along.
                         
          The car hits a bump. Mom smudges her lipstick.

          She turns to Dad and we can see her lipstick has gone up onto
          her cheek. She smiles at Dad. They all smile at this, then -
                         
          From out of nowhere, the car is T-BONED on the passenger's side.
          The impact is massive. The NOISE is deafening. Smashed glass.
          The car spins into the oncoming traffic and is hit by a delivery
          truck. The car flips. More deafening noise...
                         
          INT. RED VOLVO / D&S WRECKING YARD - MORNING
                         
          TJ wakes in the wrecked car at the wrecking yard. The loud sound
          of crunching metal continues. TJ is startled and disoriented. He
          realizes the car is moving.
                         
          EXT. WRECKING YARD - CONTINUOUS
                         
          A crane is lifting the car with a huge wrecking yard magnet. As
          it rises off the stack, it dangles at a precarious angle.
                         
          INT. RED VOLVO - CONTINUOUS
                         
          TJ is thrown through the car to be wedged up against the
          windshield. He panics. He yells. He squirms his way to the
          window and waves his arm wildly outside, yelling, trying to get
          the attention of the guys below. The car shifts violently and TJ
          slides out through the window.
                         
          EXT. D&S WRECKING YARD - CONTINUOUS
                         
          TJ is hanging dangerously out of the car, swinging his legs and
          screaming at the top of his lungs. His voice can barely be heard
          over the sound of machinery.
                         
          A guy on the ground, MARIO, looks up and spots TJ. He
          frantically looks to get the crane operator's attention.
                         
                          MARIO
           Ricky!
                          (YELLS LOUDER)
           Ricky! Kill it, man.
                         
          Ricky sticks his head out of the crane cab, like he can't hear.
                         
                          RICKY
           What?
                         
                          MARIO

          As the car is lowered TJ jumps the last few feet to the ground.
          Mario leads him away from the car and the crane.
                         
                          MARIO

                          TJ

                          MARIO

                          TJ
           I don't know. I'm sorry.
                         
                          MARIO
           This car's about to get crushed. If I
           didn't see you, you would be dead.
                         
                          TJ
           I know.
                         
                          MARIO
           What were you thinking, man?
                         
          TJ doesn't respond, he backs away.
                         
          Mario watches him walk away, still disbelieving. He turns back
          to Ricky and gives him the all clear to start her up again.
                         
          TJ walks to the entrance gate while behind him his mom's car is
          hoisted high in the air.
                         
          TJ stops at a dirty vending machine by the gate. He pulls coins
          from his pocket and slots them in. It spits out a chocolate bar.
                         
          Moments later TJ stands with his half-eaten chocolate bar while
          watching his Mom's car get fed into a giant crushing machine and
          compacted into scrap. Tears well in his eyes. He feels helpless.

           Just go to your room.
                         
          Dad knows he's being pathetic. TJ walks off down the hall.

           I didn't know if I should come here or
           not, but I couldn't stop thinking
           about it. I thought maybe if I came
           you'd still just be really angry at me
           and hate me, but then I thought if I
           didn't you'd think I didn't care and
           you'd hate me anyway, so I figured I
           might as well come, just in case, so

          TJ looks at her, he doesn't really want to be mad at her.
                         
                          NICOLE (CONT'D)
           I understand if you don't want to be
           my friend. I didn't mean to hurt your
           feelings. Sometimes I just... I don't
           know. I just wanted to come around and
           say all that, but maybe you still hate
           me and so it doesn't matter, but I
           just came round to say that, but I've
           said it now, so I should just go. So,
           OK, bye.
                         
          Nicole walks off. She gets half way across the lawn before -
                         
                          TJ
           I'm sorry I broke your lamp.

          Nicole turns.
                         
                          NICOLE
           It's OK.
                         
                          TJ
           And I'm sorry I called you a fat
           prostitute.
                         
                          NICOLE
           It's OK.
                         
                          TJ
           You're not fat.
                         
          Nicole smiles at this.
                         
                          NICOLE
           But I'm a prostitute?
                         
                          TJ
           I dunno. Maybe.
                         
          They smile at one another. She crosses the lawn back toward TJ.
          She fixes his tie. She smiles again and then she leaves.
                         
          INT. GRANDMA'S CAR / FAIR OAKS STREET - AFTERNOON
                         
          Dad and TJ sit in the front seat. They are still angry and not
          speaking to each other. It is an unpleasant and uncomfortable
          ride. They both wear a suit and tie.
                         
          EXT. FUNERAL HOME - AFTERNOON
                         
          Dad and TJ drive into the funeral home parking lot in Grandma's
          car. A few people are milling around.
                         
          INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY
                         
          Dad and TJ enter the funeral home foyer. They look like they
          don't know where they're supposed to go. They are greeted by the
          funeral director from earlier. He talks in a soft monotone
          whisper.
                         
                          FUNERAL DIRECTOR
           Excuse me, Mr. Forney, may I have a
           word?
                         
          He takes Dad aside.

           FUNERAL DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
           I hate to have to do this here, but
           there's a couple of things I need to
           discuss with you quickly, if that's
           OK.
                         
                          DAD
           Ah, sure.
                         
                          FUNERAL DIRECTOR
           I know that we discussed your
           preferences for some aspects of
           today's service, including your choice
           of the cedar casket which the
           insurance company had covered.
           Unfortunately we were out of those and
           instead we've chosen a mahogany
           casket. Now there is an extra charge
           for the mahogany which I need to clear
           with you before we proceed. Is that
           OK?
                         
          Dad looks confused. He doesn't know how he's supposed to
          respond.
                         
                          DAD
           Ah, I guess.
                         
                          FUNERAL DIRECTOR
           OK, great, thank you. If you could
           just sign here.
                         
          The director hands Dad a fancy pen and holds out a dense order
          form for him to sign.
                         
           FUNERAL DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
           Just at the bottom there.
                         
          Dad's pen hovers. He doesn't know where he's signing.
                         
           FUNERAL DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
           Just here, Mr. Forney, just under
           that... yes, that's great.
                         
          Dad signs and hands the pen back.
                         
           FUNERAL DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
           Now, just one other thing - we have
           another service following yours today,
           we hate to do this, but we're going to
           have to try to get through yours as
           quickly as possible.

          The funeral director's cell phone vibrates loudly on his belt.
          He ignores it. Dad can't.
                         
           FUNERAL DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
           I don't want you to feel rushed, but
           we are really under the pump today and
           I just thought I should give you the
           heads up. Now, I notice, just looking
           at your order of service... (beat,
           thinking) Ah, look, let's play it by
           ear. We should be fine.
                         
          Dad looks at the funeral director, not quite sure he's hearing
          him right. The funeral director's phone continues to vibrate.
                         
           FUNERAL DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
           OK. Excuse me.
                         
          The funeral director walks away and answers his phone.
                         
          INT. SERVICE ROOM - DAY
                         
          The funeral director stands at the front of the room. He hits
          play on the in-house stereo - generic classical musak. TJ and
          Dad take seats next to each other, but they might as well be a
          hundred miles apart. About ten other people sit.
                         
          The funeral director hits stop. He stands and approaches the
          microphone.
                         
                          FUNERAL DIRECTOR
           We are gathered here today to mourn
           the loss and commemorate the life of
           Madeleine Frances Forney.
           (to arriving late comers)
           Ah, if you could please take your
           seats as quickly as possible that'd be
           great. Thank you.
           (he waits a beat)
           Madeleine was a beloved wife, mother,
           grandmother and friend. And now Mrs
           Agnes Rosowski, a dear friend and
           neighbor, will say a few quick words.
                         
          MRS AGNES ROSOWSKI hobbles her way to the microphone.
                         
                          MRS ROSOWSKI
           I did not know Madeleine long enough,
           but from the moment I moved into the
           neighborhood so many years ago, she
           treated me as though I was part of the
           family.

           Madeleine always had open arms and
           welcomed friends as kindly as her own.
           She had such a kind wonderful heart.
                         
          While Agnes speaks, TJ and Dad notice the funeral director, off
          to the side, whispering business to two of his employees. He
          makes every attempt to be subtle and discreet about it, but he
          is clearly struggling with today's workload.
                         
           MRS ROSOWSKI (CONT'D)
           We shared so many wonderful walks and
           enjoyed each other's company very
           much. I will miss our walks. I will
           miss our talks and most of all, I will
           miss Madeleine. I will always remember
           what she told me, life is like
           walking in the rain, you can either
           hide and take shelter or you can just
           get wet. She was dear to me and she
           will always have a place in my heart.
                         
          Agnes places her hand on Grandma's coffin and stands for a long
          silent beat.
                         
           MRS ROSOWSKI (CONT'D)
           I love you, Madeleine.
                         
          Another drawn out moment of silence. The funeral director takes
          this opportunity to step to the microphone.
                         
                          FUNERAL DIRECTOR
           OK, thank you, Agnes...
                         
          Agnes steps towards her seat. When she sees TJ she stops.
                         
                          MRS ROSOWSKI
           TJ, I think you should say something.
                         
          The funeral director pauses awkward. Everyone looks at TJ.
                         
           MRS ROSOWSKI (CONT'D)
           Go on, TJ.
                         
          TJ gets up reluctantly. He doesn't know what to say. He stands
          at the microphone and struggles for a long beat, but nothing
          comes out.
                         
                          TJ
           Sorry.
                         
          TJ makes his way off the stage.

          Sound of slow clapping from the back. It's Hesher. His hair
          looks extra greasy, he's wearing a dirty white Budweiser T-shirt
          and he's holding a tall can of beer under his arm which spills
          as he claps. He is VERY drunk.
                         
          The funeral director tries to wrap it up.
                         
                          FUNERAL DIRECTOR
           OK, so at this point we should
           conclude today's service with a
           moment's silence, after which lemonade
           will be served in the...
                         
                          HESHER
           Actually, I'd like to add to TJ's
           speech. I think I know where he was
           going with that.
                         
          Hesher stands and makes his way to the front. The funeral
          director tries politely to protest.
                         
                          FUNERAL DIRECTOR
           I'm sorry, sir...
                         
          Dad stands up in the aisle and tries to stop Hesher.
                         
                          DAD
           What are you doing here?
                         
          Up on the stage, funeral home employees begin wheeling Grandma's
          coffin away.
                         
                          HESHER
           Hey, hey, hey...
                         
          Hesher pushes past Dad and stops the coffin.
                         
                          HESHER (CONT'D)
           What are you doing? Get your fuckin'
           hands off that box.
                         
          The funeral director walks up to Hesher.
                         
                          FUNERAL DIRECTOR

           You touch me again, I'll rip your
           fucking head off and skull fuck you.
                         
          The funeral director backs off, scared and unsure of what to do.

           fucking be here, but I'm not here for
           me, I'm fuckin' here for her-

           goodbye or have my farewell or
           whatever the fuck you assholes call it
           - this is not how I want to say
           goodbye to someone I like - in this

          TJ's dad stands and interrupts.
                         
                          DAD
           OK, this is enough-
                         
                          HESHER
           Yeah, well why don't you shut up for
           a second and listen cause I'm going to
           say what I want to say and then you'll
           never see me again. Alright?!
                         
          There is a beat of silence. No one knows what to say or do.

           I'm here cause she's been trying to
           tell you guys something, but you don't
           want to listen... so I'm gonna fuckin'
           break it down.
                         
          Hesher takes a long pull from his beer can.
                         
                          HESHER (CONT'D)
           I pulled the gas tank from an old
           Chevy and I wanted to fuckin' blow it
           up, so I did. I didn't think about the
           millions of bits of metal that were
           gonna fly in every direction. I almost
           killed myself. I woke up in a
           hospital. I couldn't remember what
           happened and then this doctor at the
           end of my bed said 'son', and I said,
           'don't call me son you fuckin' cunt',
           then he said, 'you blew off your nut'.
           Some shrapnel had penetrated my left
           scrotal sack and ripped the furry
           sucker right off. My left fucking nut
           was gone, just like that.
                         
          Hesher makes a magic disappearing arm gesture, spilling a bit of
          beer on the floor.
                         
                          HESHER (CONT'D)
           I went crazy. I assaulted a nurse, a
           doctor or two, I can't remember. I got
           arrested. I got sent to juvie. But all
           I could think about day and night was
           my missing fuckin' nut. I couldn't eat
           or sleep, I just wanted my fucking nut
           back. I had to get out of there and
           find it, so I busted out of juvie and
           went lookin' for it. I looked for
           days, but didn't find shit.
                         
          The tiny crowd listens, half offended, half intrigued.
                         
                          HESHER (CONT'D)
           And then one night I was taking a shit
           and I was just staring down at my
           balls, looking at my flabby piece of
           sack where my left nut used to be and
           then I noticed my right nut, for like
           the first time. My right nut was just
           sitting there, totally happy, just
           hanging out.

           All this time I'd been driving myself
           crazy thinking about my missing nut
           and not thinking about the nut I still
           had all along. And I realized, I've
           still got a nut. I've still got one
           good nut. God or the Devil or whoever
           left me with one good nut. At least I
           didn't lose both my nuts. I've still
           got one good nut and it works, and my
           dick works too.
                         
          Hesher looks up at TJ and Dad, sad and imploring, he's made his
          point. They look back at him stunned.
                         
                          HESHER (CONT'D)
           You lost your mom. You lost your wife.
           I lost a nut.
                         
          Hesher takes the last swig of his Budweiser. He sways, drunk.
          This soaks in with the crowd.
                         
                          HESHER (CONT'D)
           Fuck this.
                         
          Hesher throws the can down. He goes to stomp on it. He misses
          and stumbles, crashing into the microphone podium, knocking it
          over and falling in a heap with it. He starts puking on the
          stage. A couple of old ladies are horrified.
                         
          The funeral director motions to his assistants that now is the
          time to move the coffin out. Hesitantly, they obey. Hesher looks
          over from the floor.
                         
                          HESHER (CONT'D)
           Leave her alone. We're not finished
           yet.

           Unfortunately sir, we need to be.
                         
          They continue to push the coffin away. Hesher lifts himself up
          and wipes the vomit from his face and steps toward the coffin.
          The funeral workers back away.
                         
                          HESHER
           I told Grandma I was going on a walk
           with her and I'm gonna do it!
                         
          Determined, Hesher leans down and unlocks the wheels of the
          coffin stand.
                         
          Dad stands, not exactly sure what to do.

          With purpose Hesher pushes the coffin down the stage ramp and
          down the center aisle of the room, toward the exit. He turns to
                         TJ -
                         
                          HESHER (CONT'D)
           You promised Grandma you'd go on a
           walk with her. This is your last
           chance.
                         
          Hesher seems overcome with emotion, he continues pushing the
          coffin toward the exit and out through the doors.
                         
          TJ and Dad watch him, unsure. After a moment, They follow him to
          the door. They stand at the doors watching Hesher push the
          coffin out into the parking lot.
                         
          TJ is overcome with emotion, his eyes well with tears. He heads
          across the lot and catches up with Hesher, joining him on the
          walk. Dad watches for a beat, his eyes well up too, then he does
          the same.
                         
          All three are now walking together through the funeral home
          parking lot with Grandma's coffin. They don't speak. It's a
          release. Other mourners watch from the doorway.
                         
          EXT. FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Hesher wheels Grandma's coffin across the parking lot with TJ
          and Dad beside him. They seem solemn and strangely dignified in
          a dishevelled way.
                         
          Hesher leads them out of the parking lot and into the street.
          Traffic passes around them. Some cars come to a complete stop.
                         
          Hesher gets the coffin up onto the sidewalk on the other side of
          the street and the three continue their silent walk with
          Grandma.
                         
          In slow motion the three walk. Dad puts his arm around TJ's
          shoulders, TJ puts his arm around Dad's.
                         
          And then a cop car cruises beside them slow. The cops inside
          watch them. Dad looks over. One of the cops smiles.
                         
          EXT. FORNEY HOUSE - EVENING
                         
          The cop car pulls up outside the house. The back door opens and
          Hesher falls out onto the sidewalk, still very drunk. Dad climbs
          out and steps over Hesher helping him to his feet. A cop speaks
          to them from the open window.

           That's the plan.
                         
          Hesher squirms and slurs.

          The cop gives them a casual wave as their car pulls away. TJ and
          Dad help Hesher across the lawn to the front door. We hold on
          the house for a beat.

          Dad stands over the sink cutting away at his beard. Golden
          sunlight pours in through the windows.
                         
          A moment later he lathers his face up with shaving cream.

          There's a gentle knock at the door. TJ wakes and makes a big
          stretch. His hair's a mess.
                         
                          TJ
           Come in.

          EXT. FORNEY HOUSE / GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          The garage door is open. The garage is flooded with daylight and
          no sign of Hesher.
                         
          TJ and Dad walks across the garage to the open door. At the
          garage's entrance they stop. Their eyes register something
          seriously unusual outside.
                         
          'Master of Puppets' by Metallica punches in. LOUD.
                         
          A giant red cube of Volvo scrap metal has been placed in the
          center of the driveway like a huge piece of abstract art. They
          stand and stare at it, almost in awe.
                         
          Then from the across the street, we see the object in the
          driveway and TJ and Dad on the porch looking at it.
                         
          We also see the words 'HESHER WAS HERE!' spray painted on the
          front of the house in big letters, as yet unseen by TJ and Dad.
          Dad puts his arm around TJ's shoulders.
                         
          On the beat we CUT TO:
                         
                         HESHER MOMENTS:
                         
          Hesher ripping on the guitar; Hesher blowing something up;
          Hesher cupping a fart and putting it in TJ's face; Hesher
          pantsing Dad; Hesher metal saluting Grandma and Grandma saluting
          him back.
                         
          Hesher behind the wheel of his van, smoking a cigarette and
          making a direct line for the setting sun.
                         
          A mouse sits an in a tiny armchair like a human, shelling a
          peanut. He throws the shell over his shoulder watching the
          setting sun.
                         
           CUT TO BLACK:
