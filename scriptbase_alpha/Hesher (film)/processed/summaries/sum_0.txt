T.J., a high school freshman, lost his mother two months' before in a car accident: his father pops pills and sits on the couch; his grandmother holds things together, chatting and cooking.
T.J. wants the car back from the salvage yard where the owner's son is a bully.
By happenstance, Hesher, a foul-mouthed squatter, moves in with T.J's family.
T.J. also meets Nicole, a grocery clerk near poverty who helps him once.
Hesher involves T.J. in crime, the bully is omnipresent, mom's car is slipping away, dad has checked out, T.J. watches Nicole at work, and his grandma invites him to join her morning walk: the odds are long that T.J. can assemble a family to help him thrive.
