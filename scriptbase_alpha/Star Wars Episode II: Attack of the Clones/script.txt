EXT. SPACE
A vast sea of stars severas as a backdrop for the Main Title, following by a rollup, whcih crawls into infinity.

                    There is unrest in the Galactic Senate
                    Several hundred solar systems under
                    the leadership of the rebel leader, Count
                    Dooku, have decalred their intentions to
                    secede from the Republic.

                    This separatist movement has made it
                    difficult for the limited number of
                    Jedi Kights to maintain peace and
                    order in the galaxy.

                    Senator Amidala, the former Queen of
                    Naboo, is returning to Coruscant
                    to vote on the critical issue
                    of creating an army to assist the
                    overwhelmed Jedi.

PAN UP to reveal the amber city planet of Coruscant. A yellow Naboo Fighter flies OVER CAMERA toward the planet, followed by a large Royal Cruiser and two more Fighters.

EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - DAWN
The ships skim across the surface of the city landscape. The sun glints off the chrome hulls of the sleek Naboo spacecraft as they navigate between the buildings of the capital planet.

EXT. CORUSCANT, LANDING PLATFORM - DAWN
Two Naboo Fighters land on one leaf of a three-leaf-clover landing platform. The Royal Starship lands on the central lead, and the third Fighter lands on the remaining plaform.

A small GROUP OF DIGNITARIES waits to welcome the Senator. One of the members of the group os a well dressed JAR JAR BINKS, a member of the Galactic Representative Commission, and DORME, Senator Amidala's handmaiden.

One of the FIGHTER PILOTS jumps from the wing of his ship and removes his helmet. He is CAPTAIN TYPHO, SENATOR AMIDALA'S Security Officer. He moves over to a WOMAN PILOT.

CAPTAIN TYPHO
We made it. I guess I was wrong,
there was no danger at all.

The ramp ;pwers. TWO NABOO GUARDS appear. SENATOR AMIDALA, ONE HANDMAIDEN (VERSE) and FOUR TROOPERS descend the ramp. AMIDALA is more beautiful now than she was ten years earlier when, as Queen, she was freeing her people from the yoke of the Trade Federation.

The DIGNITARIES start to move forward. SENATOR AMIDALA reaches the foot of the ramp, when suddenly there is a blinding FLASH and a huge EXPLOSION. The DIGNITARIES and PILOTS are hurled to the ground as the starship is destroyed.

Klaxons blare, alarms sound! CAPTAIN TYPHO and the TWO ESCORT PILOTS get up and run to where SENATOR AMIDALA lies dying. Beyond, ARTOO DETOO drops down from the Naboo Fighter and rolls toward the wreckage. The FEMALE ESCORT PILOT kneels by SENATOR AMIDALA and takes off her helmet, revealing SENATOR PADME AMIDALA.

                    PADMÉ 
               Cordé...

She gathers up her decoy double in her arms. Cordé's eyes are open. She looks up at her.

                    CORDÉ
               ... I'm sorry, m'lady... I'm... not sure I... 

CORDÉ dies. PADMÉ hugs her.

                    AMIDALA
               No!... No!... No!...

PADMÉ lowers CORDÉ to the ground. She gets up and looks around at the devastation. There are tears in her eyes.

                    AMIDALA
               I should not have come back.

                    CAPTAIN TYPHO
               M'Lady, you are still in danger.

Amidala says nothing.

                    CAPTAIN TYPHO
               This vote is very important. You did
               your duty and Cordé did hers. Now
               come. (she doesn't respond) M'Lady,
               please!

She turns. They walk away. ARTOO lets out a small whimper and rolls off after them.

EXT. SENATE BUILDING - DAY 
The massive Senate Building glistens in the afternoon sun. Small patches of fog have still to burn off.

INT. SENATE CHAMBER - DAY
The vast rotunda is buzzing with chatter. MAS AMEDDA, the Supreme Chancellor's majordomo, tries to quiet things down as PALPATINE confers with an AIDE, UV GIZEN, riding a small one man floating scooter.

                    MAS AMEDDA
               Order! We shall have order! The motion
               for the Republic to commission an army
               takes precedent, and that is what we
               will vote on at this time.

Everything quiets down. The AIDE disperses, and SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE steps to the podium.

                    PALPATINE
               ...My esteemed colleagues, excuse
               me... I have just received some
               tragic and disturbing news. Senator
               Amidala of the Naboo system... Has
               been assassinated!

There is a shock silence in the vast arena.

                    PALPATINE
                    (continued)
               This grievous blow is especially
               personal to me. Before I became
               Chancellor, I served Amidala when
               she was Queen. She was a great
               leader who fought for justice, not
               only in this honourable assembly,
               but also on her home planet. She
               was so loved she could have been
               elected queen for life. She
               believed in public service, and
               she fervently believed in
               democracy. Her death is a great
               loss to us all. We will all mourn
               her as a relentless champion of
               freedom... and as a dear friend.

There is a moment of silence. ASK AAK, the SENATOR of MALASTARE, moves his pod into the centre of the arena.

                    SENATOR ASK AAK
               How many more Senators will die
               before this civil strife ends! We
               must confront these rebels now,
               and they need an army to do it.

A second pod moves into the centre of the area with DARSANA, the 
AMBASSADOR OF GLEE ANSELM.

                    AMBASSADOR DARSANA
               Why weren't the Jedi able to stop
               this assassination? We are no
               longer safe, under their protection.

Senator ORN FREE TAA swings forward in his pod.

                    ORN FREE TAA
               The Republic needs more security
               now! Before it comes to war.

                    PALPATINE
               Must I remind the Senator from
               Malastare that negotiations are
               continuing with the separatists.
               Peace is our objective here... not
               war.

The SENATORS yell pro and con. MAS AMEDDA tries to calm things down. SENATOR PADME AMIDALA, with CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR, and DORME, manoeuvre her pod into the centre of the vast arena.

                    AMIDALA
               My noble colleagues, I concur with
               the Supreme Chancellor. At all
               costs, we do not want war!

The Senate goes quiet, then there is an outburst of cheering and 
applause.

                    PALPATINE
               It is with great surprise and
               joy the chair recognises the
               Senator from Naboo, Padmé Amidala.

                    PADMÉ
               Less than an hour ago, an
               assassination attempt was made
               against my life. One of my
               bodyguards and six  others were
               ruthlessly and senselessly
               murdered. I was the target but,
               more importantly, I believe this
               security measure before you, was
               the target. I have led the
               opposition to build an army... but
               there is someone in this body who
               will stop at nothing to assure it's
               passage...

Many of the SENATORS boo and yell at SENATOR AMIDALA.

                    PADMÉ
                     (continuing)
               I warn you, if you vote to create
               this army, war will follow. I
               have experienced the misery of war 
               first-hand; I do not wish to do it
               again.

There is sporadic yelling for and against her statements.

                    PADMÉ
               Wake up, Senators... you must wake
               up! If you offer the separatists
               violence, they can only show us
               violence in return! Many will
               lose their lives. All will lose
               their freedom. This decision
               could very well destroy the very
               foundation of our great Republic.
               I pray you do not let fear push
               you into a disastrous decision.
               Vote down this security measure,
               which is nothing less than a
               declaration of war! Does anyone
               here want that? I cannot believe
               they do.

There is an undercurrent of booing... and groaning. SENATOR ORN FREE TAA moves his pod next to AMIDALA.

                    ORN FREE TAA
               My motion to defer the vote must
               be dealt with first. That is the
               rule of law.

AMIDALA looks angry and frustrated. PALPATINE gives her a sympathetic look.

                    PALPATINE
               Due to the lateness of the hour
               and the seriousness of this
               motion, we will take up these
               matters tomorrow. Until then, the
               Senate stands adjourned.

EXT. EXECUTIVE QUARTERS BUILDING - DAY 
The giant towers of the Republic Executive Building seem to reach the heavens. Traffic clogs the smoggy sky.

INT. CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE - DAY 
CHANCELLOR PALPATINE sits behind his desk with TWO RED-CLAD ROYAL GUARDS on either side of the door. YODA, PLOT KOON, KI-AD-MUNDI, and MACE WINDU sit acress from him.

                    PALPATINE
               I don't know how much longer I can
               hold off the vote, my friends.
               More and more star systems are
               joining the separatists.

                    MACE WINDU
               If they do break away -

                    PALPATINE
               No! I will not let that happen!

                    MACE WINDU
               But if they do, you must realise
               there aren't enough Jedi to
               protect the Republic. We are
               keepers of the peace, not soldiers.

                    PALPATINE
               Master Yoda, do you think it will
               really come to war?

YODA closes his eyes.

                    YODA
               Worse than war, I fear... Much
               worse. 

                    PALPATINE
               What?

                    MACE WINDU
               What do you sense, Master?

                    YODA
               Impossible to see ... The Dark Side
               clouds everything. But this I am
               sure of -
                    (opens his eyes)
               Do their duty the Jedi will.

A muted BUZZER SOUNDS. A hologram of an AIDE, DAR WAC, appears on the Chancellor's desk.

                    DAR WAC
               The loyalist committee has arrived,
               my Lord. 

                    PALPATINE
               Send them in.

They all stand as SENATOR AMIDALA, CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR, MAS AMEDDA, DORME, and SENATORS BAIL ORGANA, HOROX RYYDER and ORN FREE TAA enter the office. YODA and MACE WINDU move to greet the SENATOR, YODA taps AMIDALA with his cane.

                    YODA
               With you the force is strong...
               young Senator. To see you alive
               brings warm feeling to my heart.

                    PADMÉ
               Thank you, Master Yoda. Do you
               have any idea who was behind
               the attack?

                    MACE WINDU
               Our intelligence points to
               disgruntled spice miners, on
               the moons of Naboo.

                    PADMÉ
               I don't wish to disagree but I
               think that Count Dooku was behind
               it.

There is a stir of surprise.

                    MACE WINDU
               You know, M'Lady, Count Dooku
               was once a Jedi. He wouldn't
               assassinate anyone, it is not in
               his character.

                    KI-ADI-MUNDI
               He is a political idealist, not
               a murderer.

                    YODA
               In dark times nothing is what it
               appears to be, but the fact remains
               Senator, in grave danger you are.

PALPATINE gets up, walks to the window, and looks out at the vast city.

                    PALPATINE
               Count Dooku has always avoided
               any kind of conflict. It appears
               he has no desire to start a war.
               Why would he kill you? To what end?

                    PADMÉ 
               I don't know, but everything in my
               being tells me he was behind it... 

After gazing out of the window for several moments Palpatine turns to 
Mace.

                    PALPATINE
               Master Jedi, may I suggest that
               the Senator be placed under the
               protection of your graces.

                    BAIL ORGANA
               Do you think that is a wise use
               of manpower during these stressful
               times?

                    PADMÉ
               Chancellor, if I may comment, I
               do not believe the...

                    PALPATINE
               ..."situation is that serious."
               No, but I do, Senator.

                    PADMÉ
               Chancellor, please! I don't want
               any more guards!

                    PALPATINE
               I realise all too well that
               additional security might be
               disruptive for you, but perhaps
               someone you are familiar with... an
               old friend like... Master Kenobi...

PALPATINE nods to MACE WINDU, who nods back.

                    MACE WINDU
               That's possible. He has just
               returned from a Border dispute on
               Ansion.

                    PALPATINE
               You must remember him, M'Lady...
               he watched over you during the
               blockade conflict.

                    PADMÉ
               This is not necessary, Chancellor.

                    PALPATINE
               Do it for me, M'Lady, please. I
               will rest easier. We had a big
               scare today. The thought of
               losing you is unbearable.

AMIDALA sighs as the JEDI get up to leave.

                    MACE WINDU
               I will have Obi-Wan report to you
               immediately, M'Lady.

YODA leans into her ear.

                    YODA
               Too little about yourself you
               worry, Senator, and too much about
               politics. Be mindful of your
               danger, Padmé. Accept our help.

As the JEDI leave the office, PALPATINE continues to pace behind his desk.

                    PALPATINE
               I will not like this Republiv, that
               has stood for over a thousand
               years, be split in two

EXT. SENATE APARTMENTS - TWILIGHT
A graceful skyscraper twinkles in the evening light of Coruscant.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, APARTMENT CORRIDOR - EVENING
The door to the apartment slides open. JAR JAR walks into the corridor, where TWO JEDI are exiting the elevator. He recognises OBI-WAN and becomes extremely excited, jumping around, shaking his hand.

                    JAR JAR
               Obi! Obi! Obi! Mesa sooo smilen
               to see'en yousa. Wahoooooo!

OBI-WAN smiles.

                    OBI-WAN
               It's Good to see you, too, Jar Jar.

                    JAR JAR
               Oops! Wheresa mesa manners?
               Excuse me, Master Obi-Wan. I
               completely forgot myself for
               a moment there. I have had to learn
               Diplodiaclect... speak it like a
               native now. Don't really see the
               point, actually, but members of
               the Senate seem to prefer it...

JAR JAR notices OBI-WAN'S APPRENTICE.

                    JAR JAR
                    (continuing)
               ...and this, I take it, is your
               apprentice... Nooooooooo! Annie?
               Noooooooo! Little Bitty Annie?
                    (Looks at Anakin)
               Nooooooo! Yousa so biggen!
               Yiyiyiyyi! Annie!! Mesa no
               believen.

                    ANAKIN
               Hi, Jar Jar.

JAR JAR grabs hold of ANAKIN and envelops him in a big hug.

                    JAR JAR
               Annie! Annie! Yiyiyiyiyiyiiii!

INT. SENATE BUILDING, APARTMENT - EVENING
PADME is in a conference with CAPTAIN TYPHO and DORME. JAR JAR enters the room, followed by the TWO JEDI.

                    JAR JAR
               Lookie... lookie... Oops!... Oh,
               dear, I'm afraid I've forgotten
               myself again.

PADME and TYPHO rise as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN stop before the SENATOR. OBI-WAN steps forward. ANAKIN stares at PADME. She glances at him.

                    OBI-WAN
               It's a great pleasure to see you again,
               M'Lady.

                    PADMÉ
               It has been far too long Master
               Kenobi. I'm so glad our paths
               have crossed again... but I must
               warn you that I think your
               presence here is unnecessary.

                    OBI-WAN
               I'm sure the Jedi Council have
               their reasons.

She moves in front of ANAKIN

                    PADMÉ
               Annie??
                    (stares)
               My goodness you've grown.

They look at each other for a long moment.

                    ANAKIN
                    (trying to be smooth)
               So have you... grown more
               beautiful, I mean... and much
               shorter... for a Senator, I mean.

OBI-WAN looks disapprovingly at his apprentice. PADME laughs and shakes her head.

                    PADMÉ
               Oh Annie, you'll always be that
               little boy I knew on Tatooine.

This embarrasses ANAKIN, and he looks down. OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN TYPHO smile.

                    OBI-WAN
               Our presence will be invisible,
               M'Lady.

                    CAPTAIN TYPHO
               I am very grateful you are here,
               Master Kenobi. The situation is
               more dangerous than the Senator
               will admit.

                    PADMÉ
               I don't need more security, I need
               answers. I want to know who is
               trying to kill me.

                    OBI-WAN
                    (frowning)
               We're here to protect you
               Senator, not to start an
               investigation.

                    ANAKIN
               We will find out who is trying to
               kill you Padmé, I promise you.

He's done it again. He bites his lip in frustration and shame. OBI-WAN gives ANAKIN a dirty look.

                    OBI-WAN
               We are not going to exceed our
               mandate, my young Padawan learner.

                    ANAKIN
               I meant in the interest of
               protecting her, Master, of course.

                    OBI-WAN
               We are not going through this
               exercise again, Anakin. You will
               pay attention to my lead.

                    ANAKIN
               Why?

                    OBI-WAN
               What??!!

                    ANAKIN
               Why else do you think we were
               assigned to her, if not to find
               the killer? Protection is a job
               for local security... not Jedi.
               It's overkill, Master.
               Investigation is implied in our
               mandate.

                    OBI-WAN
               We will do as the Council has
               instructed, and you will learn
               your place, young one.

                    PADMÉ
               Perhaps with merely your presence,
               the mysteries surrounding this
               threat will be revealed.  Now if
               you will excuse me I will retire.

Everyone gives AMIDALA a slight bow as she and DORME leave the room.

                    CAPTAIN TYPHO
               Well, I know I feel a lot better
               having you here.
               I'll have an officer on every
               floor and I'll be at the command
               centre downstairs.

                    JAR JAR 
               Mesa busten wit happiness seein
               Yousa again, Annie. Deesa bad
               times, bombad times.

Captain Typho leaves.

                    ANAKIN
               She didn't even recognise me, Jar
               Jar. I thought about her every
               day since we parted... and she's
               forgotten me completely.

                    JAR JAR
               Shesa happy. Happier den mesa
               see-en her in longo time.

                    OBI-WAN
               Anakin, you're focusing on the
               Negative again. Be mindful of your
               thoughts. She was glad to see us.
               Now lets check the security here.

                    ANAKIN
               Yes, my master.

EXT. JEDI TEMPLE - EVENING
The vast Jedi Temple sits on an endless flat plain, silhouetted by a against the traffic-filled sky.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, CORRIDOR - EVENING
MACE WINDU and YODA walk down the long hallways, silhouetted by a lit room at the end.

                    MACE WINDU
               Why couldn't we see this attack on
               the Senator?

                    YODA
               Masking the future, is this
               disturbance in the Force.

                    MACE WINDU
               The propecy is coming true, the
               Dark Side is growing.

                    YODA
               And only those who have turned to
               the Dark Side can sense the
               possibilities of the future. Only
               going through the Dark Side can we
               see.

                    MACE WINDU
               It's been ten years, and the Sith
               still have no shown themselves.
               Do you think they are behind this?

                    YODA
               ...Out there, they are. A
               certainty that is.

                    MACE WINDU
               Do you think Obi-Wan's apprentice
               will be able to bring balance to
               the Force?

                    YODA
               Only if he chooses to follow his
               destiny.

There is a long silence as they walk away. Only footsteps are heard.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
PADME is asleep in her bed, lit only by the light of the city outside her window coming through the blinds. ARTOO stands in the corner of the bedroom. His power is off.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, MAIN R0OM - NIGHT
ANAKIN is standing in the living room. He is in a meditative state. It is quiet. We hear DISTANT FOOTSTEPS in the corridor outside the apartment. Suddenly ANAKIN'S eyes pop open. His eyes dart around the room. He reaches for his lightsaber, then smiles and puts it back in his belt.

The door to the apartment slides open, and OBI-WAN enters.

                    OBI-WAN
               Captain Typho has more than enough
               men downstairs. No assassin will
               try that way. Any activity up
               here?

                    ANAKIN
               Quiet as a tomb. I don't like
               just waiting here for something to
               happen to her.

OBI-WAN checks a palm-sized view scanner he has pulled out of his utility belt. It shows a shot of ARTOO by the door, but no sign of PADME on the bed.

                    OBI-WAN
               What's going on?

ANAKIN shrugs.

                    ANAKIN
               She covered that camera. I don't
               think she liked me watching her.

                    OBI-WAN
               What is she thinking?

                    ANAKIN
               She programmed Artoo to warn us if
               there's an intruder.

                    OBI-WAN
               It's not an intruder I'm worried
               about. There are many other ways
               to kill a Senator.

                    ANAKIN
               I know, but we also want to catch
               this assassin. Don't we, Master?

                    OBI-WAN
               You're using her as bait??

                    ANAKIN
               It was her idea... No harm will
               come to her. I can sense
               everything going on in that room.
               Trust me.

                    OBI-WAN
               It's too risky... and your senses
               aren't that attuned, young
               apprentice.

                    ANAKIN
               And yours are?

                    OBI-WAN
               Possibly.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
As PADME sleeps, a PROBE DROID approaches outside her window. It sends out several small arms that attach to the window, creating sparks that shut down the security system. Then a large arm cuts a small hole in the glass. A FAINT SOUND is heard as the small section of glass is removed from the window.

ARTOO wakes up, and his lights go on. The PROBE DROID freezes. ARTOO looks around, makes a PLAINTIVE LITTLE SOUND, then shuts down again. The PROBE DROID attaches a little tube to the window. TWO DEADLY LOOKING CENTIPEDE-LIKE KOUHUNS exit the tube, crawl through the blinds and head toward the sleeping PADME.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN continue their conversation in the main room of the apartment.

                    OBI-WAN 
               You look tired.

                    ANAKIN
               I don't sleep well, anymore.

                    OBI-WAN 
               Because of your mother?

                    ANAKIN
               I don't know why I keep dreaming
               About her now. I haven't seen her
               since I was little.

                    OBI-WAN
               Dreams pass in time.

                    ANAKIN
               I'd rather dream of Padmé. Just
               Being around her again is...
               intoxicating.

                    OBI-WAN
               Mind your thoughts, Anakin, they
               betray you. You've made a
               commitment to the Jedi order... a
               commitment not easily broken...
               and don't forget she's a
               politician. They're not to be
               trusted.

                    ANAKIN 
               She's not like the others in the
               Senate, Master.

                    OBI-WAN
               It's been my experience that
               Senators are only focused on
               pleasing those who fund their
               campaigns... and they are more
               than willing to forget the
               niceties of democracy to get those
               funds.

                    ANAKIN
               Not another lecture, Master. Not
               on the economics of politics....
               It's too early in the morning... and
               besides, you're generalising. The
               Chancellor doesn't appear to
               be corrupt.

                    OBI-WAN
               Palpatine's a politician, I've
               observed that he is very clever at
               following the passions and
               prejudices of the Senators.

                    ANAKIN
               I think he is a good man. My
               instincts are very positive
               about...

ANAKIN looks stunned. He looks sharply at OBI-WAN

                    OBI-WAN
               I sense it, too.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
ARTOO sounds an alarm and shines a light on the bed. THE KOUHUNS are inches from PADME'S face. Their mouths are open, and wicked stinger tongues flick out.


OBI-WAN and ANAKIN burst into the room. The KOUHUNS stand on their hind legs and hiss as PADME wakes up. ANAKIN throws himself in front of her, whacking in half the deadly creatures with his lightsaber.

OBI-WAN sees the DROID outside the window and raqces straight at it, crashing through the blinds as he goes through the window.

EXT. WINDOW LEDGE, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
OBI-WAN flies through the glass window and flings himself at the PROBE DROID, grabbing onto the deadly machine before it can flee. The PROBE DROID sinks under the weight of OBI-WAN but manages to stay afloat and fly away, with the Jedi hanging on for dear life, a hundred stories above the city.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
ANAKIN and PADME stare at the sight of OBI-WAN being carried off by the DROID. ANAKIN turns to her. She pulls her nightdress around her shoulders.

                    ANAKIN
               Stay here!

CAPTAIN TYPHO, with TWO GUARDS and DORME, enter the room as Anakin dashes out.

EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - NIGHT
The PROBE DROID sends several protective electrical shocks across its surface, causing OBI-WAN to almost lose his grip. As they dart in and out of the speeder traffic, OBI-WAN disconnects a wire on the back of the DROID. Its power shuts off! OBI-WAN and the DROID drop like rocks. OBI-WAN realises the error of his ways and quickly puts the wire back. The DROID'S systems light up again and it takes off. 

EXT. SENATE APARTMENTS - ENTRANCE - NIGHT
ANAKIN charges out of the building and runs to a line of parked speeders. He vaults into an open one and takes off, gunning it fast toward the lines of speeder traffic high above.

EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - NIGHT
The DROID bumps against a wall, hoping to knock the Jedi loose. It moves behind a speeder afterburner to scorch him. It takesthe JEDI wildly between buildings and finally skims across a rooftop as OBI-WAN is forced to lift his legs, tenaciously hanging onto the DROID. The DROID heads for a dirty, beat-up speeder hidden in an alcove of a building about twenty stories up. When the pilot of the speeder, a scruffy bounty hunter called ZAM WESELL, sees the DROID approach with OBI-WAN hanging on, she pulls a long rifle out of the speeder and starts to fire at the JEDI. EXPLOSIONS burst all around OBI-WAN.

                    OBI-WAN
               I have a bad feeling about this.

FINALLY, the DROID suffers a direct hit and blows up. OBI-WAN falls fifty stories, until a speeder drops down next to him, and he manages to grab onto the back end of the speeder and haul himself toward the cockpit. The JEDI struggles to climb into the passenger seat of the open speeder and sit down next to the driver, ANAKIN.

                    ANAKIN
               That was wacky! I almost lost you
               in the traffic.

                    OBI-WAN
               What took you so long?

                    ANAKIN
               Oh, you know, Master, I couldn't
               find a speeder I really liked,
               with an open cockpit... and with
               the right speed capabilities...
               and then you know I had to get a
               really gonzo color...

They zoom upward in hot pursuit of ZAM asshe fires out the open window at them with her laser pistol.

                    OBI-WAN
               If you'd spend as much time
               working on your saber skills as
               you do on your wit, young Padawan,
               you would rival Master Yoda as a
               swordsman.

                    ANAKIN
               I thought I already did.

                    OBI-WAN
               Only in your mind, my very young
               apprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!!

As this conversation is going on, ANAKIN deftly moves in and out of the oncoming traffic, across lanes, between buildings, and miraculously through a construction site. ZAM WESELL continues firing at them.

                    ANAKIN
               Sorry, I forgot you don't like
               flying, Master.

                    OBI-WAN
               I don't mind flying... but
               what you're doing is suicide!

They barely miss a commuter train

                    ANAKIN
               Master, you know I've been flying
               since before I could walk. I'm very
               good at this.

                    OBI-WAN
               Just slow down!

ZAM WESSEL and the JEDI race through a line of cross-traffic made up of giant trucks. The speeders bank sideways as they slide around right-angle turns between buildings. ZAM races into a tram tunnel.

                    OBI-WAN
                    (continuing)
               Wait! Don't go in there!

ANAKIN zooms into the tunnel after ZAM. They see a tram coming at them. They brake, turn around, and race out, barely ahead of the charging commuter transport.

                    OBI-WAN
                    (continuing)
               You know I don't like it when you
               do that!

                    ANAKIN
               Sorry, Master. Don't worry, this
               guy's gonna kill himself any
               minute now!

ZAM WESSEL turns into oncoming traffic, deliberately trying to throw the JEDI off. Oncoming speeders swerve, trying to avoid ZAM and the JEDI. ZAM does a quick, tight loop-over and ends up behind the JEDI. She is now in a much better position to fire at them with her laser pistol. To avoid being hit by the laser bolts, ANAKIN slams on the brakes and moves alongside ZAM. She now fires point-blank at OBI-WAN.

                    OBI-WAN
               What are you doing? He's gonna
               blast me!

                    ANAKIN
               Right - this isn't working.

ANAKIN slides underneath Zam's speeder. They race along in traffic, one speeder right on top of the other. The BOUNTY HUNTER skims over the rooftops, causing ANAKIN to drop behind. ANAKIN goes through his gears, zooming around traffic. They race at high speed across a wide, flat surface of the city planet. A large spacecraft almost collides with them as it attempts to land. They round a corner and clip a flag, which gets caught on one of the front air scoops.

                    OBI-WAN
               That was too close!

                    ANAKIN
               Clear that!

                    OBI-WAN
               What??

                    ANAKIN
               Clear the flag! We're losing
               power! Hurry!

OBI-WAN leans out of the speeder, then crawls out onto the front engine, pulling the flag free of the scoop. The speeder lurches forward with a surge of power.

                    OBI-WAN
               Whooooaaa! Don't do that! I
               don't  like it when you do that!

                    ANAKIN
               So sorry, Master.

They chase the BOUNTY HUNTER through a power refinery.

                    OBI-WAN
               It's dangerous near those power
               couplings! Slow down! Don't go
               through there!

Huge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the speeders pass.

                    OBI-WAN
                    (continuing)
               Yiiii, what are you doing?

                    ANAKIN
               Sorry, Master!

                    OBI-WAN
                    (sarcastically)
               Oh, that was good...

                    ANAKIN
               That was crazy!!!

ZAM slides around a corner sideways, blocking an alley, firing point-blank as ANAKIN approaches.

                    ANAKIN
                    (continuing)
               Ahh, damn.

                    OBI-WAN
               Stop!!

                    ANAKIN
               No, we can make it.

ANAKIN barely misses the BOUNTY HUNTER'S speeder as he dives under it, and through a small gap in the building hitting several pipes and going wildly out of control. ANAKIN struggles to regain control of the speeder, narrowly missing a crane, barely clipping a pair of giant struts. A giant gasball shoots up, causing ANAKIN to spin and bump a building, stalling the speeder.

                    OBI-WAN
               I'm crazy... I'm crazy... I'm
               crazy.

                    ANAKIN
               But it worked... we made it.

                    OBI-WAN
                    (angrily)
               It didn't work... we've stalled!
               And you almost got us killed!

                    ANAKIN
               I think we're still alive.

ANAKIN works to get the speeder started. It quickly races to life.

                    OBI-WAN
                    (very angrily)
               It was stupid!

                    ANAKIN
                    (sheepishly)
               I could have made it...

                    OBI-WAN
                    (furious)
               But you didn't!!! And now we've
               lost him.

Suddenly, there is an ambush. Laser bolts fire everywhere. EXPLOSIONS surround them. They look up to see ZAM WESSEL take off.

                    ANAKIN
               No we didn’t...

Out of a cloud of smoke and ball of flames the JEDI tear after ZAM. They are smoking. OBI-WAN slaps out the small fire on the dashboard. ZAM goes up and down, through cross-traffic. There is a near miss as a speeder almost hits them. ZAM turns down and left between two buildings. ANAKIN pulls up and to the right

                    OBI-WAN
               Where are you going?! He went
               down there, the other way.

                    ANAKIN
               This is a shortcut... I think.

                    OBI-WAN
               What do you mean, ‘You think?’
               What kind of shortcut?! He went
               completely the other way! You’ve
               lost him!

                    ANAKIN
               Master, if we keep this chase
               going, that creep’s gonna end up
               deep fried. Personally, I’d very
               much like to find out who in the
               hell he is and who he’s working
               for...

                    OBI-WAN
                    (sarcastic)
               Oh, so that’s why we’re going in
               the wrong direction.

ANAKIN turns up a side street, zooming up several small passageways, then stops, hovering about fifty stories up.

                    OBI-WAN
                    (continuing)
               Well, you lost him.

                    ANAKIN
               I’m deeply sorry, Master.

ANAKIN looks around front and back. He spots something. He seems to 
start counting to himself as he watches something below approach.

                    ANAKIN
                    (continuing)
               Excuse me for a moment.

ANAKIN jumps out of the speeder. OBI-WAN looks down and sees Zam’s speeder about five stories below them cruising past. ANAKIN miraculously lands on top of the Bounty Hunter’s speeder. The speeder wobbles under the impact. ZAM looks up and realises what has happened.

ZAM takes off, and ANAKIN slides to the back strut and almost slips off, but manages to hang on. ANAKIN works his way back to the speeder’s cockpit, just as ZAM stops suddenly, and ANAKIN flies forward to the left front fork. ZAM shoots at him with a laser pistol. There is a BLAST near ANAKIN'S hand, which breaks off a piece of the speeder. ANAKIN slides to the right fork of the speeder, where ZAM can’t reach him. He scrambles to the top, holding onto an air scoop.

OBI-WAN has jumped into the driver’s seat of his speeder and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder. The two speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through cross traffic. Finally, ANAKIN is able to get hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of the speeder. ZAM takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at the helpless JEDI, knocking the sword out of his hand. OBI-WAN races under the speeder and catches the Jedi weapon in the passenger’s seat.

ANAKIN sticks his hand into the cockpit and, using the Force, pulls the gun out of ZAM’S hand. She grabs the Jedi’s hand, and they struggle for the weapon. It goes off, blowing a hole in the floor of the speeder. The speeder careens wildly out of control. ZAM struggles to pull the speeder out of it’s nose dive. OBI-WAN gets slowed down by traffic and loses sight of the Bounty Hunter’s speeder.

Just as the dragster is about to nose dive into the ground, ZAM pulls it out, and it slides hard on the pavement in a shower of sparks. ANAKIN goes flying into the street.

EXT. ENTERTAINMENT STREET - NIGHT
ZAM exits the crashed speeder and runs. ANAKIN picks himself up off the pavement and runs down the very crowded street.

It's the seedy underbelly of the city. Broken sidewalks, garish lights reflected on the filthy puddles. It's pretty crowded with various ALIEN LOW-LIFES, PANHANDLING DROIDS, and the occasional group of UPPERCLASS SLUMMERS.

ANAKIN barges into several of them as he chases after the fleeing ZAM. He loses the Bounty Hunter in the crowd, them sees him again. The young Jedi is having a very difficult time getting through the crowd.

Ahead, ZAM turns in through a door and disappears.

A nightclub sighs is flashing over the door. ANAKIN is just about to follow ZAM when there is a sudden swirl of litter from downthrusters. PEOPLE start moving out of the way, and the open speeder lands in the street beside him. OBI-WAN gets out and walks over, holding out ANAKIN'S lightsaber.

                    OBI-WAN
               Anakin!

                    ANAKIN
               She went into that club, Master.

                    OBI-WAN
               Patience.

OBI-WAN hands ANAKIN the lightsaber.

                    OBI-WAN
                     (continuing)
               Here. Next time try not to lose it.

                    ANAKIN
               Sorry, Master.

ANAKIN reaches for the lightsaber, but OBI-WAN holds it back.

                    OBI-WAN
               A Jedi's saber is his most
               precious possession.

                    ANAKIN
               Yes, Master.

He reaches for the lightsaber, OBI-WAN pulls it back.

                    OBI-WAN
               He must keep it with him at all
               times.

                    ANAKIN
               I know, Master.

                    OBI-WAN
               This weapon is your life!

                    ANAKIN
               I've heard this lesson before...

OBI-WAN finally holds out the lightsaber and ANAKIN grabs it.

                    OBI-WAN
               But, you haven't learned anything,
               Anakin.

                    ANAKIN
               I try, Master.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN enter the nightclub bar, and everyone stares at them

                    OBI-WAN
               Why do I think you are going to be
               the death of me?!

                    ANAKIN
               Don't say that Master... You're
               the closest thing I have to a
               father... I love you. I don't want
               to cause you pain.

                    OBI-WAN
               Then why don't you listen to me?!

                    ANAKIN
               I will. I'll do better, I promise.

                    OBI-WAN
               Do you see him him?

                    ANAKIN
               I think he's a she...

                    OBI-WAN
               Then be extra careful...
                    (nods to a room)
               Check it out.

OBI-WAN goes away.

                    ANAKIN
               Where are you going, Master?

                    OBI-WAN
               To get a drink.

OBI-WAN heads for the bar. ANAKIN blinks in surprise, then moves into the room, where ALIEN FACES look back at him with hostility, suspicion, and invitation as he moves among the tables. OBI-WAN arrives at the bar. He signals the BARMAN.

CLOSE - Somewhere in the room a HAND moves to a pistol in its holster and unsnaps the safety catch. At the bar, a glass is placed in from of OBI-WAN. A drink is poured. He lifts the glass.

                    ELAN SLEAZEBAGGANO
               Wanna buy some death sticks?

OBI-WAN looks at him. He moves his fingers slightly.

                    OBI-WAN
               You don't want to sell me death-
               sticks.

                    ELAN
               I don't want to sell you death-
               sticks.

OBI-WAN moves his fingers.

                    OBI-WAN
               You want to go home and rethink 
               your life.

                    ELAN
               I want to go home and rethink my
               life.

He leaves. OBI-WAN lifts the drink and tosses it back.

CLOSE. The gun is drawn from its holster and held down out of sight. The BOUNTY HUNTER starts to move toward the bar.

ANAKIN checks out ALIEN FACES. OBI-WAN signals for another drink. The gun moves toward his unsuspecting back.

The drink is poured. OBI-WAN reaches for it. The gun is raised to aim directly at his back, and suddenly OBI-WAN turns fast. His lightsaber flashes. There is a shrill SCREAM and ZAM'S ARM hits the floor. The gun drops from its twitching fingers. Blood spreads.

The room is silent. ALIENS rise menacingly from their seats, and ANAKIN is suddenly at OBI-WAN's side, his lightsaber glowing.

                    ANAKIN
               Easy... Official business. Go
               back to your drinks.

Slowly, the ALIENS sit. Conversation resumes. Onstage, THE PERFORMERS pick up their routine. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lift ZAM and carry her out.

EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN carry ZAM into the alley and lower her to the ground. OBI-WAN attends to her wounded shoulder. She stares up hatefully at ANAKIN. She winces in pain, then nods.

                    OBI-WAN
               Do you know who it was you were
               trying to kill?

                    ZAM WESSEL
               The Senator from Naboo.

                    OBI-WAN
               Who hired you?

ZAM glares at OBI-WAN.

                    ZAM WESSEL
               It was just a job.

                    ANAKIN
               Tell us!

                    ZAM WESSEL
               That Senator's gonna die soon
               anyway, and the next one won't
               make the same mistake I did...

                    OBI-WAN
               This wound's going to need
               treatment.

                    ANAKIN
               Who hired you? Tell us... tell us
               now!

ZAM glares hatefully.

                    ZAM
               It was a Bounty Hunter called...

There is a sudden FTZZZ sound. ZAM twitches. She blinks in surprise and dies.

There is a WEOOSH from above. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN look up yo see an ARMOURED ROCKET-MAN taking off from a roof high above. OBI-WAN looks down at ZAM. He touches her neck and pulls out a small, wicked-looking dart.

                    OBI-WAN
               Toxic Dart...

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT - DAY
ANAKIN and JAR JAR stand near the door of the anteroom to PADME'S 
bedroom. PADME and DORME move about packing luggage.

                    PADMÉ
               Representative Binks. I know I can
               count on you.

                    JAR JAR
               Yousa betchen mesa bottums.

                    PADMÉ
               What?!

                    JAR JAR
                    (coughs, recovers)
               Oh, pardone-ay, Senator. I mean,
               I am honoured to accept this heavy
               burden. I take on this
               responsibility with deep humility
               tinged with an overwhelming pride.
                    (pompously)
               It is not every day that I am
               called upon to...

PADME kisses him on the cheek and gives him a hug. JAR JAR turns red.

                    PADMÉ
               You're a good friend, Jar Jar. I
               don't wish to hold you up. I'm
               sure you have a great deal to do.

                    JAR JAR
               Of course, M'lady.

JAR JAR bows and goes out. As he passes ANAKIN, he flashes a dazzling smile... PADME is in a very bad mood.

                    PADMÉ
               I do not like this idea of hiding.

                    ANAKIN
               Don't worry. Now that the Council
               has ordered an investigation, it
               won't take Master Obi-Wan long to
               find that bounty hunter.

                    PADMÉ
                    (frustrated)
               I haven't worked for a year to
               defeat the "Military Creation Act"
               not to be here when its fate is
               decided.

                    ANAKIN
               Sometimes we have to let go of our
               pride and do what is requested of
               us.

                    PADMÉ
               Pride?!? Annie, you're young, and
               you don't have a very firm grip on
               politics. I suggest you reserve
               your opinions for some other time.

                    ANAKIN
               Sorry, M'lady. I was only trying
               to...

                    PADMÉ
               Annie! No!

                    ANAKIN
               Please don't call me that.

                    PADMÉ
               What?

                    ANAKIN
               Annie...

                    PADMÉ
               I've always called you that... it
               is your name, isn't it?

                    ANAKIN
               It's Anakin. When you say Annie
               it's like I'm still a little
               boy... and I'm not.

                    PADMÉ
               I'm sorry, Anakin. It's impossible
               to deny you've...
                    (looks him over)
               ...that you've grown up.

PADME smiles at ANAKIN. He becomes a little shy.

                    ANAKIN
               Master Obi-Wan manages not to see
               it...

                    PADMÉ
               Mentors have a way of seeing more
               of our faults than we would like.
               It's the only way we grow.

                    ANAKIN
               Don't get me wrong... Obi-Wan is
               a great mentor. As wise as Master
               Yoda and as powerful as Master
               Windu. I am truly thankful to be
               his apprentice. Only... although
               I'm a Padawan learner, in some
               ways... a lot of ways... I'm ahead
               of him. I'm ready for the trials.
               I know I am! He knows it too. He
               believes I'm too unpredictable...
               Other Jedi my age have gone
               through the trials and made it...
               I know I started my training
               late... but he won't let me move
               on.

                    PADMÉ
               That must be frustrating.

                    ANAKIN
               It's worse... he's overly
               critical. He never listens! He
               just doesn't understand! It's not
               fair!

PADME cannot surpress a laugh. She shakes her head.

                    PADMÉ
               I'm sorry... You sounded exactly
               like that little boy I once knew,
               when he didn't get his way.

                    ANAKIN
               I'm not whining! I'm not.

PADME just smiles at him. DORME laughs in the background.

                    PADMÉ
               I didn't say it to hurt you.

                    ANAKIN
               I know...

There is a brief silence. PADME comes over to ANAKIN.

                    PADME
               Anakin...

They look into each other's eyes for the first time.

                    PADMÉ
                    (continuing)
               Don't try to grow up too fast.

                    ANAKIN
               I am grown up. You said it
               yourself.

ANAKIN looks deep into PADME'S eyes.

                    PADMÉ
               Please don't look at me like that.

                    ANAKIN
               Why not?

                    PADMÉ
               Because I can see what you're
               thinking.

                    ANAKIN
                    (laughing)
               Ahh... so, you have Jedi powers
               too?

DORME is watching with concern.

                    PADMÉ
               It makes me feel uncomfortable.

                    ANAKIN
               Sorry, M'lady.

ANAKIN backs away as PADME turns and goes back to her packing.

EXT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS - DAY 
A small bus speeds toward the massive freighter docks of Coruscant's Industrial area. The spaceport is bustling with activity. Transports of various sizes moves supplies and passengers as giant floating cranes lift cargo out of starships. The bus stops before a huge intergalactic freighter starship. It parks in the shadows of an overhang.

INT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME, dressed in Outland peasant outfits, get up and head for the door where CAPTAIN TYPHO, DORME and OBI-WAN are waiting to hand them their luggage. DORME is dressed to look like Senator Amidala.

                    CAPTAIN TYPHO
               Be safe, m'lady.

                    PADMÉ
               Thank you, Captain. Take good
               care of Dorme... the threat's on
               you two now.

                    DORME
               He'll be safe with me.

They laugh, and PADME embraces her faithful handmaiden. DORME start to weep.

                    PADMÉ
               You'll be fine.

                    DORME
               It's not me, M'Lady. I worry
               about you. What if they realise
               I'm not you?

                    PADMÉ
                    (looks to Anakin)
               Then my Jedi protector will have
               to prove how grown up he is.

DORME and PADME smile. ANAKIN frowns as OBI-WAN pulls him aside.

                    OBI-WAN
               Anakin, you stay put on Naboo.
               Do not attract any attention. Do
               absolutely nothing without
               checking in with me or the Council.

                    ANAKIN
               Yes, Master.

                    OBI-WAN
                    (to Padme)
               I will get to the bottom of this
               plot quickly, M'Lady. You'll be
               back here in no time.

                    PADMÉ
               I will be most grateful for your
               speed, Master Jedi.

                    ANAKIN
               Time to go.

                    PADMÉ
               I know. 

PADME gives DORME a last hug. ANAKIN picks up the luggage, and the TWO PEASANTS exit the speeder bus, where ARTOO is waiting for them.

                    OBI-WAN
               May the Force be with you.

                    ANAKIN
               May the Force be with you, Master.

They head off toward the giant Starfreighter.

                    PADMÉ
               Suddenly, I'm afraid...

                    ANAKIN
               I'm kinda scared too. This is my
               first assignment on my own.

                    PADMÉ
               There's nothing to worry about...
               we have Artoo with us.

The two laugh.

OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN TYPHO watch ANAKIN and PADME disappear into the 
vastness of the spaceport with ARTOO trundling along behind them.

                    OBI-WAN
               I hope he doesn't try anything
               foolish.

                    CAPTAIN TYPHO
               I'd be more concerned about her
               doing something, than him.

EXT. FREIGHTER DOCKS - CORUSCANT - DAY
The freighter slowly takes off from the huge docks area of Coruscant. It soon moves into the crowded skies.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, MAIN HALLWAY - LATE DAY
From high above, light streams down from the lofty ceilings. OBI-WAN crosses the floor of the great hallway, heaading for the Analysis Rooms.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, ANALYSIS CUBICLES - LATE DAY
OBI-WAN walks past several glass cubicles where work is going on. He comes to an empty one and sits down in front of a console. A PK-4 ANALYSIS DROID comes to life. A tray slides out of the console.

                    PK-4
               Place the subject for analysis on
               the sensot tray, please.

OBI-WAN puts the dart onto the traym which retracts into the console. The DROID activates the system, and a screen lights up in from of OBI-WAN.

                    OBI-WAN
               It's a toxic dart. I need to know
               where it came from and who made it.

                    PK-4
               One moment, please.

Diagrams and .... appear on the screem, scrolling past at great speed. OBI-WAN watches as the screen goes blank. They tray slides out.

                    PK-4
                    (continuing)
               As you can see on your screen,
               subject weapon does not exist in
               any known culture. Markings
               cannot be identified. Probablt
               self-made by a warrior not
               associated with any known society.

                    OBI-WAN
               Excuse me? Could you try again
               please?

                    PK-4
               Master Jedi, our records are very
               thorough. they cover eight
               percent of the galaxy. If I can't
               tell you where it came from,
               nobody can.

OBI-WAN picks up the dart and looks at it, then looks to the DROID.

                    OBI-WAN
               Thanks for your assistance! You
               may not be able to figure this
               out, but I think I know someone
               who might.

EXT. SPACE, STARSHIP FREIGHTER
The massive, slow-moving Freighter suddenly zooms away into lightspeed.

INT. STARFREIGHTER, STORAGE HOLD - DAY
The great, gloomy hold is crowded with EMIGRANTS and their belongings. To one side ARTOO is coming to the head of a food line, where SERVERS are ladling out bowls of mush. ARTOO holds two bowls.

                    SERVER
               Keep moving! Keep moving!

ARTOO slips tube into a tub of mush and sucks up a large quantity. With one of his little claw-arms, he grabs several chunks of something that looks like brown bread. A SERVER sees him.

                    FOOD SERVER
                    (continuing)
               Hey! No Droids!

ARTOO takes one last big suck and heads away from the food line. The SERVER shouts after him angrily. The little droid moves past groups of eating or sleeping EMIGRANTS and comes to where ANAKIN is sound asleep. The young Jedi seems to be having a nightmare. He is very restless.

                    ANAKIN
               No, no, Mom, no...

He is sweating. PADME leans over to wipe some of the sweat from his forehead. He wakes up with a start, then realises where he is. PADME simply looks at him. He stares back, somewhat confused. ARTOO fills up two bowls with mush.

                    ANAKIN
                    (continuing)
               What?

                    PADMÉ
               You seemed to be having a
               nightmare.

ANAKIN looks at PADME a little more closely, trying to see if he has revealed any of his secrets. She hands him a bowl of mush and bread.

                    PADMÉ
                    (continuing)
               Are you hungry?

                    ANAKIN
               Thank you.

                    PADMÉ
               We went into lightspeed a while
               ago.

ANAKIN looks into PADME'S eyes.

                    ANAKIN
               I look forward to seeing Naboo
               again. I've thought about it every
               day since I left. It's by far the
               most beautiful place I've ever
               seen...

PADME is a little unnerved by his intense stare. 

                    PADMÉ
               You were just a little boy then.
               It may not be as you remember it;
               time changes your perception.

                    ANAKIN
               I think time has given me much
               more mature feelings to enhance my
               perception.

                    PADMÉ
               It must be difficult having sworn
               your life to the Jedi... not being
               able to visit the places you
               like... or do the things you
               like...

                    ANAKIN
               Or be with the people I love.

                    PADMÉ
               Are you allowed to love? I
               thought that was forbidden for a
               Jedi.

                    ANAKIN
               Attachment is forbidden.
               Possession is forbidden.
               Compassion, which I would define
               as unconditional love, is central
               to a Jedi's life, so you might say
               we're encouraged to love.

                    PADMÉ
               You have changed so much

                    ANAKIN
               You haven't changed a bit. You're
               exactly the way I remember you in
               my dreams. I doubt if Naboo has
               changed much either.

                    PADMÉ
               It hasn't...

                    ANAKIN
               I can't wait to breathe the sweet
               breeze that comes off the rolling
               hills. Whenever I try to
               visualise the Force, those hills
               are what I see.

ANAKIN looks at PADME when he says this.

                    ANAKIN
                    (continuing)
               I love Naboo.

There is an awkward moment.

                    PADMÉ
                    (changing the subject)
               Were you dreaming about you
               mother earlier, weren't you?

                    ANAKIN
               Yes... I left Tatooine so long
               ago, my memory of her is fading.
               I don't want to lose it. Recently
               I've been seeing her in my
               dreams... vivid dreams... scary
               dreams. I worry about her.

PADME gives ANAKIN a sympathetic look.

EXT. CORUSCANT, DOWNTOWN, BACK STREET - MORNING
OBI-WAN walks down the street. It is a pretty tough part of town. Old buildings, warehouses, beat up speeders and transporter rigs occasional "shiny freighters" hissing through.

OBI-WAN comes to a kind of alien diner. On the steamed-up windowa it says "DEX'S DINER" in alien lettering. He goes inside.

INT. CORUSCANT, DEX'S DINER - MORNING
A young waitress, HERMIONE BAGWA, is wiping off a booth tabletop. There is a counter with stools and a line of booths along the wall by the window. A number of CUSTOMERS are eating - TOUGH-LOOKING WORKERS, FREIGHTER DRIVERS etc. HERMIONE looks up as OBI-WAN comes in.

                    HERMIONE
               Can I help ya?

                    OBI-WAN
               I'm looking for Dexter.

HERMIONE'S eyes narrow.

                    HERMIONE BAGWA
               Waddya want him for?

                    OBI-WAN
               He's not in trouble. It's
               personal.

HERMIONE stares at OBI-WAN. There is a brief pause. Then she goes to the open serving hatch behind the counter.

                    HERMIONE BAGWA
               Someone to see ya, honey
                    (lowering her voice)
               A Jedi, by the looks of him.

Steam billows out from the kitchen hatch behind the counter as a huge head pokes through.

                    DEXTER JETTSTER
               Obi-Wan!

                    OBI-WAN
               Hey, Dex.

                    DEXTER JETTSTER
               Take a seat! Be right with ya!

OBI-WAN sits in a booth.

                    HERMIONE BAGWA
               You want a cup of ardees?

                    OBI-WAN
               Thank you.

HERMIONE moves off as the door to the counter opens and DEXTER JETTSTER appears. He is big - bald and sweaty, old and alien. Not someone to tangle with. He arrives, beaming hugely.

                    DEXTER JETTSTER
               Hey, ol' buddy!

                    OBI-WAN
               Hey, Dex.

DEXTER eases himself into the seat opposite OBI-WAN. He can just make it. HERMIONE sets two mugs of steaming ardees in from of them.

                    DEXTER JETTSTER
               So, my friend. What can I do for
               ya?

                    OBI-WAN
               You can tell me what this is.

OBI-WAN places the dart on the table between them. DEX'S eyes widen. He puts down his mug.

                    DEXTER JETTSTER
               Well, whattaya know...

DEXTER picks up the dart delicately between his puffy fingers and peers at it.

                    DEXTER JETTSTER
                    (continuing)
               I ain't seen one of these since I
               was prospecting on Subterrel
               beyond the Outer Rim!

                    OBI-WAN
               Do you know where it came from?

DEXTER grins. He puts the dart down between them.

                    DEXTER JETTSTER
               This baby belongs to them cloners.
               What you got here is a Kamino
               Kyberdart.

                    OBI-WAN
               Kamino Kyberdart... I wonder why
               it didn't show up in any analysis
               archive.

                    DEXTER JETTSTER
               It's these funny little cuts on
               the side give it away...
               Those analysis droids you've got
               over there only focus on symbols,
               you know. I should think you Jedi
               would have more respect for the
               difference between knowledge and
               wisdom.

                    OBI-WAN
               Well, Dex, if droids could think, we
               wouldn't be here, would we?
                    (laughing)
               Kamino... doesn't sound familiar.
               Is it part of the Republic?

                    DEXTER JETTSTER
               No, it's beyond the Outer Rim.
               I'd say about twelve parsecs
               outside the Rishi Maze, toward the
               south. It should be easy to find,
               even for those droids in your
               archive to find. Those Kaminoans
               keep to themselves. They're
               cloners. Damned good ones, too.

OBI-WAN then picks up the dart, holding it midway between them.

                    OBI-WAN
               Cloners? Are they friendly?

                    DEXTER JETTSTER
               It depends.

                    OBI-WAN
               On what, Dex?

Dexter grins. 

                    DEXTER JETTSTER
               On how good your manners are...
               and how big your pocketbook is...

EXT. NABOO SPACEPORT - DAY
The Starfreighter lands in the giant port city of Theed.

PADME, ANAKIN and ARTOO are among the EMIGRANTS streaming from the Starfreighter and into the vast docking area. They exit onto the main plaza.

EXT. NABOO PALACE, GRAND COURTYARD (NABOO) - AFTERNOON
The speeder bus pulls up and stops. PADME, ANAKIN, and ARTOO get out. The great courtyard stretches out before them, and they see the rose-colored dome of the palace on the far side. ARTOO WHISTLES. They pick up their gear and start to cross the courtyard. ARTOO trundles behind them.

                    ANAKIN
               If I grew up here, I don't think
               I'd ever leave.

                    PADMÉ
                    (laughing)
               I doubt that.

                    ANAKIN
               No, really. When I started my
               training, I was very homesick and
               very lonely. This city and my Mom
               were the only pleasant things I
               had to think about... The problem
               was, the more I thought about my
               Mom, the worse I felt. But I
               would feel better if I thought
               about the palace - the way it
               shimmers in the sunlight - the way
               the air always smells of flowers...

                    PADMÉ
               ...and the soft sound of the
               distant waterfalls. The first
               time I saw the Capital, I was very
               young... I'd never seen a
               waterfall before. I though they
               were so beautiful... I never
               dreamed one day I'd live in the
               palace.

                    ANAKIN
               Well, tell me, did you dream of
               power and politics when you were
               a little girl?

                    PADMÉ
                    (laughing)
               No! That was the last thing I
               thought of. My dream was to help
               in the "Refugee Relief Movement."
               I never thought of running for
               elected office. But the more
               history I studied, the more I
               realised how much good politicians
               could do. So when I was eight, I
               joined the "Apprentice
               Legislators", then later on became
               a Senatorial advisor, with such a
               passion that, before I knew it, I
               was elected Queen. Partly because
               I scored so high on my education
               certificate, but for the most part
               it was my conviction that reform
               was possible. I wasn't the
               youngest Queen ever elected, but
               now that I think back on it, I'm
               not sure I was old enough. I'm not
               sure I was ready.

                    ANAKIN
               The people you served thought you
               did a good job. I heard they
               tried to amend the Constitution so
               you could stay in office.

                    PADMÉ
               Popular rule is not democracy,
               Annie. It gives the people what
               they want, not what they need.
               And, truthfully, I was relieved
               when my two terms were up. So
               were my parents. They worried
               About me during the blockade and
               couldn't wait for it all to be
               over. Actually, I was hoping to
               have a family by now... My
               sisters have the most amazing,
               wonderful kids... but when the
               Queen asked me to serve as
               Senator, I couldn't refuse her.

                    ANAKIN
               I agree! I think the Republic
               needs you... I'm glad you chose
               to serve. I feel things are going
               to happen in our generation that
               will change the galaxy in profound
               ways.

                    PADMÉ
               I think so too.

ANAKIN and PADME walk toward the palace. ARTOO continues to follow.

INT. NABOO PALACE, THRONE ROOM - AFTERNOON
QUEN JAMILLIA is seated on the throne, flanked by SIO BIBBLE and a COUPLE OF ADVISORS. FOUR HANDMAIDENS stand close by, and GUARDS are at the doors.

                    QUEEN JAMILLIA
               We've been worried about you.
                    (takes her hand)
               I'm so glad you're safe, Padmé.

                    PADMÉ
               Thank you, Your Highness. I only
               Wish I could have served you
               better by staying on Coruscant for
               the vote.

                    SIO BIBBLE
               Given the circumstances, Senator,
               you know it was the only decision
               Her Highness could have made.

                    QUEEN JAMILLIA
               How many systems have joined Count
               Dooku and the separatists?

                    PADMÉ
               About two hundred. And more are
               leaving the Republic every day.
               If the Senate votes to create an
               army, I'm sure it's going to push
               us into a civil war.

                    SIO BIBBLE
               It's unthinkable! There hasn't
               been a full-scale war since the
               formation of the Republic!

                    QUEEN JAMILLIA
               Do you see any way, through
               negotiations, to bring the
               separatists back into the Republic?

                    PADMÉ
               Not if they feel threatened. The
               separatists don't have an army,
               but if they are provoked, they
               will move to defend themselves.
               I'm sure of that. And with no time
               or money to build an army, my
               guess is they will turn to the
               Commerce Guilds or the Trade
               Federation for help.

                    QUEEN JAMILLIA
               The armies of commerce! Why has
               Nothing been done in the Senate
               to restrain them?

                    PADMÉ
               I'm afraid that, despite the
               Chancellor's best efforts, there
               are still many bureaucrats,
               judges, and even Senators on the
               payrolls of the Guilds.

                    SIO BIBBLE
               It's outrageous! After all of
               those hearings, and the four trials in
               the Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is
               still the Viceroy of the Trade
               Federation. Do those money
               mongers control everything?

                    QUEEN JAMILLIA
               Remember, Counsellor, the courts
               were able to reduce the
               Federation's armies. That's a
               move in the right
               direction.

                    PADMÉ
               There are rumours, Your Highness,
               that the Federation Army was not
               reduced as they were ordered.

                    ANAKIN
               The Jedi have not been allowed to
               investigate. It would be to be too
               dangerous for the economy, we were
               told.

                    QUEEN JAMILLIA
               We must keep our faith in the
               Republic. The day we stop
               believing democracy can work is
               the day we lose it.

                    PADMÉ
               Let's pray that day never comes.

                    QUEEN JAMILLIA
               In the meantime, we must consider
               your own safety.

SIO BIBBLE signals. All the other ADVISORS and ATTENDANTS bow and leave the room.

                    SIO BIBBLE
                    (to Anakin)
               What is your suggestion, Master
               Jedi?

                    PADMÉ
               Anakin's not a Jedi yet, Counsellor.
               He's still a Padawan learner. I
               was thinking...

                    ANAKIN
                    (nettled)
               Hey, hold on a minute!

                    PADMÉ
               Excuse me! I was thinking I would
               stay in the Lake Country. There
               are some places up there that are
               very isolated.

                    ANAKIN
               Excuse me?! I am in charge of
               security here, M'Lady.

SIO BIBBLE and QUEEN JAMILLIA exchange a look. Something is going on here.

                    PADMÉ
               Annie, my life is at risk, and
               this is my home. I know it very
               well... that is why we're here.
               I think it would be wise for you
               to take advantage of my knowledge
               in this instance.

                    ANAKIN
                    (takes a deep breath)
               Sorry, M'Lady.

                    SIO BIBBLE
                    (to Anakin, amused)
               She is right. The Lake Country is
               the most remote part of Naboo.
               Not many people and a clear view
               of the surrounding terrain.

                    QUEEN JAMILLIA
               Perfect. It's settled then.

ANAKIN glares at PADME. Then QUEEN JAMILLIA gets up, and they all start to leave.

                    QUEEN JAMILLIA
                    (continued)
               Padmé, I had an audience with your
               father yesterday. I told him what
               was happening. He hopes you will
               visit your mother before you
               leave... your family's very
               worried about you.

PADME looks worred. They ALL exit down the main staircase.

EXT. JEDI TEMPLE - DAY
The main entrance at the base of the huge temple is bustling with activity. All sorts of JEDI are coming and going.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, ARCHIVES LIBRARY - DAY
A bronze bust of Count Dooku, stands among a line of other busts of Jedi in the Archive Room. OBI-WAN stands in front it, studying the striking features of the chiselled face.

On the walls, lighted computer panels seem to stretch into infinity. Farther along the room in the background, FIVE JEDI are seated at tables, studying archival material.

After OBI-WAN studies the bust for a few moments before MADAME JOCASTA NU, the Jedi Archivist is standing next to him. She is an elderly, frail-looking human Jedi. Tough as old boots and smart as a whip.

                    JOCASTA NU
               Did you call for assistance?

                    OBI-WAN
                    (distracted in thought)
               Yes... yes, I did...

                    JOCASTA NU
               He has a powerful face, doesn't
               he? He was one of the most
               brilliant Jedi I have had the
               privilege of knowing.

                    OBI-WAN
               I never understood why he quit.
               Only twenty Jedi have ever left
               the Order.

                    JOCASTA NU
                    (sighs)
               The Lost Twenty... and Count Dooku
               was the most recent and the most
               painful. No one likes to talk
               about it. His leaving was a great
               loss to the Order.

                    OBI-WAN
               What happened?

                    JOCASTA NU
               Well, one might say, he was always
               a bit out of step with the
               decisions of the Council... much
               like your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.

                    OBI-WAN
                    (surprised)
               Really?

                    JOCASTA NU
               Oh, yes. They were alike in many
               ways. Very individual thinkers...
               idealists...

JOCASTA NU stares at the bust

                    JOCASTA NU
                    (continuing
               He was always striving to become
               a more powerful Jedi. He wanted
               to be the best. With a lightsaber,
               in the old style of fencing, he
               had no match. His knowledge of
               the Force was... unique. In the
               end, I think he left because he
               lost faith in the Republic. He
               believed that politics were
               corrupt, and he felt the Jedi
               betrayed themselves by serving the
               politicians. He always had very
               high expectations of government.
               He disappeared for nine or ten
               years, then he just showed up
               recently as the head of the
               separatist movement.

                    OBI-WAN
               Interesting... I'm still not sure
               I understand.

                    JOCASTA NU
               Well, I'm sure you didn't call me
               over here for a history lesson.
               Are you having a problem, Master
               Kenobi?

                    OBI-WAN
               Yes, I'm trying to find a planet
               system called Kamino. It doesn't
               seem to show upon any of the
               archive charts.

                    JOCASTA NU
               Kamino? It's not a system I'M
               familiar with... Let me see...

JOCASTA NU leans over OBI-WAN'S shoulder, looking at the screen.

                    JOCASTA NU
                    (continuing)
               Are you sure you have the right
               co-ordinates?

                    OBI-WAN
                    (nodding)
               According to my information, it
               should be in this quadrant
               somewhere... just south of the
               Rishi Maze.

JOCASTA NU taps the keyboard and frowns.

                    JOCASTA NU
               No co-ordinates? It sounds like the
               kind of directions you'd get from
               a street tout... some old miner or
               Furbog trader.

                    OBI-WAN
               All three actually.

                    JOCASTA NU
               Are you sure it exists?

                    OBI-WAN
               Absolutely.

                    JOCASTA NU
               Let me do a gravitational scan.

OBI-WAN and JOCASTA NU studt the star map hologram.

                    JOCASTA NU
               There are some inconsistencies
               here. Maybe the planet you're
               looking for was destroyed.

                    OBI-WAN
               Wouldn't that be on record?

                    JOCASTA NU
               It ought to be. Unless it was very
               recent.
                    (shakes her head)
               I hate to say it, but it looks
               like the system you're searching
               for doesn't exist.

                    OBI-WAN
               That's impossible... perhaps the
               archives are incomplete.

                    JOCASTA NU
               The archives are comprehensive and
               totally secure, my young Jedi.
               One thing you may be absolutely
               sure of - if an item does not
               appear in our records, it does not
               exist!

OBI-WAN stares at her, then looks back at the map.

EXT. THEED, RESIDENTIAL AREA, SIDE STREET - AFTERNOON
PEOPLE are passing through the little street, OLD MEN are sunning themslves, WOMEN are gossipping, KIDS are playing. ANAKIN, PADME and ARTOO turn onto a side street. ANAKIN is back in his Jedi robes. PADME wear a beautiful simple dress. She stops, beaming.

                    PADME
               There's my house!

PADME starts forward; ANAKIN hangs back.

                    PADME
                    (continuing)
               What? Don't say you're shy!

                    ANAKIN
                    (untruthfully)
               No, but I...

Suddenly, there are shouts from two little girils, RYOO (age 6) and POOJA (age 4). They come running toward PADME.

                    RYOO & POOJA
               Aunt Padme!! Aunt Padme!!

                    PADME
               Ryoo!! Pooja!!

PADME scoops up RYOO and POOJA and hugs them.

                    PADME
                    (continuing)
               I'm so happy to see you! This is
               Anakin. Anakin, this is Ryoo, and
               this is Pooja.

ANAKIN and the GIRLS say hello shyly. Then:

                    RYOO & POOJA
               Artoo!!!

As they see the droid, they hug him. ARTOO WHISTLES and BEEPS. PADME laughs. ANAKIN and PADME go on toward the house. The GIRLS stay and play with ARTOO.

INT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - AFTERNOON
SOLA, PADME'S beautiful older sister, comes in from the kitchen carrying a big bowl of food.

                    SOLA
                    (over her shoulder)
               They're eating over at Jev
               Narran's later, Mom. They just
               had a snack. They'll be fine.

SOLA puts the bowl down on the table, where ANAKIN, PADME and RUWEE NABERRIE (Padme's father) are coming into the room.

                    PADME
               Anakin, this is my sister, Sola.

                    SOLA
               Hello, Anakin.

                    ANAKIN
               Hello.

SOLA sits, as JOBAL NABERRIE (Padme's mother) comes in with a heaped bowl of steaming food.

                    JOBAL
               You're just in time for dinner. I
               hope you're hungry, Anakin.

                    ANAKIN
               A little.

                    PADME
               He's being polite, Mom. We're
               starving.

                    RUWEE
                    (grinning)
               You came to the right place at the
               right time. Sit down, son.

EVERYONE sits and starts passing food.

                    JOBAL
                    (to Padme)
               Honey, it's so good to see you
               safe. We were so worried.

PADME gives JOBAL a dirty look. RUWEE smiles as he watches.

                    RUWEE
               Dear...

                    JOBAL
               I know, I know... but I had to say
               it. Now it's done.

                    SOLA
               Well, this is exciting! Do you
               know, Anakin, you're the first
               boyfriend my sister's ever brought
               home?

                    PADME
                    (rolls her eyes)
               Sola!! He isn't my boyfriend!
               He's a Jedi assigned by the Senate
               to protect me.

                    JOVAL
               A bodyguard?! Oh, Padme! They
               didn't tell us it was that serious!

                    PADME
               It's not, Mom, I promise.
                    (glances at Jobal)
               Anyway, Anakin's a friend. I've
               known him for years. Remember
               that little boy who was with the
               Jedi during the blockade crisis?

They nod.

                    PADME
                    (continuing)
               He grew up.

                    JOBAL
               Honey, when are you going to
               settle down? Haven't you had
               enough of that life? I certainly
               have!

                    PADME
               Mom, I'm not in any danger.

                    RUWEE
                    (to Anakin)
               Is she?

                    ANAKIN
               ...Yes... I'm afraid she is.

                    PADME
                    (quickly)
               But not much.

EXT. PADME'S PARENTS' GARDEN - AFTERNOON
ANAKIN and RUWEE are walking.

                    RUWEE
               Sometimes I wish I'd traveled
               more... but I must say, I'm happy
               here.

                    ANAKIN
               Padme tells me you teach at the
               university?

                    RUWEE
                    (nodding)
               Yes, and before that, I was a
               builder. I also worked for the
               Refugee Relief Movement, when I
               was very young.

INT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - AFTERNOON
PADME, SOLA and JOBAL are clearing the table.

                    SOLA
               Why haven't you told us about him?

                    PADMÉ
               What's there to talk about?  He's
               just a boy.

                    SOLA
               A boy? Have you seen the way he
               looks at you?

                    PADMÉ
               Sola - stop it!

                    SOLA
               It's obvious he has feelings for
               you. Are you saying, little baby
               sister, that you haven't noticed?

                    PADMÉ
               I'm not your baby sister, Sola.
               Anakin and I are friends... our
               relationship is strictly
               professional.
                    (to Jobal)
               Mom, would you tell her to stop it?

                    SOLA
                    (laughing)
               Well, maybe you haven't noticed
               the way he looks at you. I think
               you're afraid to.

                    PADMÉ
               Cut it out.

                    JOBAL
               Sola's just concerned... we all
               are.

                    PADMÉ
               Oh, Mom, you're impossible. What
               I'm doing is important.

                    JOBAL
               You've done your service, Padmé.
               It's time you had a life of your
               own. You're missing so much!

EXT. PADME'S PARENTS' GARDEN - AFTERNOON
ANAKIN and RUWEE are walking in the garden. RUWEE stops and faces ANAKIN directly.

                    RUWEE
               Now tell me, son. How serious is
               this thing? How much danger is my
               daughter really in?

                    ANAKIN
               There have been two attempts on
               her life. Chances are there'll be
               more. My Master is tracking down
               the assassins. I'm sure he'll find
               out who they are. This situation,
               won't last long.

                    RUWEE
               I don't want anything to happen to
               her.

                    ANAKIN
               I don't either.

INT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, PADME'S ROOM - AFTERNOON
PADME throws some things into a bag.

                    PADME
               Don't worry, this won't take long.

                    ANAKIN
               I just want to get there before
               dark.

PADME goes on packing. ANAKIN looks around the room.

                    ANAKIN
                    (continuing)
               You still live at home.

                    PADME
               I move around so much, I've never
               had a place of my own. Official
               residences have no warmth. I feel
               good here. I feel at home.

                    ANAKIN
               I never had a real home. Home was
               always where my Mom was.

ANAKIN picks up a framed hologram.

                    ANAKIN
                    (continuing)
               Is this you?

The hologram shows Padme at age seven or eight surrounded by forty or fifty little green creatures. She is holding one in her arms. They are all smiling hugely.

                    PADME
               That was when I went with the
               Relief Group to Shadda-Bi-Boran.
               Their sun was imploding, and the
               planet was dying. I was helping
               to relocate the children. See
               that little one I'm holding? His
               name was N'a-kee-tula, which means
               sweethear. He was so full of 
               life,. All those kids were. I did
               everything I could to save him,
               but he died... they all did. They
               were never able to adapt... to
               live off their native planet.

ANAKIN picks up another hologram. It shows PADME at age ten or eleven. She is wearing official robes and standing between two robed legislators. Her expression is severe.

                    PADME
                    (continuing)
               My first day as an Apprentice
               Legislator. Notice the difference?

PADME pulls a face. ANAKIN grins. She continues packing. ANAKIN sets the two holograms down side by side - the beaming little girl, and the the stern, unsmiling adolescent.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, MAIN HALLWAY - DAY
OBI-WAN walks through the main hallway to the training area.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, TRAINING VERANDA - DAY
OBI-WAN comes out onto the veranda and stops, watching TWENTY or so FOUR-YEAR-OLDS doing training exercises, supervised by YODA. They wear helmets over their eyes and try to strike little TRAINING DROIDS with their miniature lightsabers. The DROIDS dance in front of them.

                    YODA
               Don't think... feel... be as one
               with the Force. Help you, it will.
                    (he sees Obi-Wan)
               Younglings - enough! A visitor we
               have. Welcome him.

The CHILDREN take off their helmets and turn off their lightsabers.

                    YODA
                    (continuing)
               Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet the
               mighty Bear Clan.

                    CHILDREN
               Welcome, Master Obi-Wan!

                    OBI-WAN
               I am sorry to disturb you, Master.

                    YODA
               What help to you, can I be?

                    OBI-WAN
               I’m looking for a planet described
               to me by an old friend. I trust
               him. But the system doesn’t show
               up on the archive maps.

                    YODA
               An interesting puzzle. Gather
               round the map reader, younglings.
               Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet.
               Find it, we will try...

The map reader is a small shaft with a hollow opening at the top. The CCHILDREN gather around it. OBI-WAN takes out a little glass ball and places it into the bowl. The window shades close darkening the room and the reader lights up, projecting the star map hologram into the room. The CHILDREN laugh. Some of them reach up to try and touch the nebulae and stars. OBI-WAN walks into the display.

                    OBI-WAN
               This is where it ought to be...
               but it isn’t. Gravity is pulling
               all the stars in this area inward
               to this spot. There should be a
               star here... but there isn’t.

                    YODA
               Most interesting. Gravity’s
               silhouette remains, but the star
               and all its planets have
               disappeared. How can this be?

There is a brief pause. Then a CHILD puts its hand up. YODA nods.

                    JEDI CHILD JACK
               Because someone erased it from the
               archive memory.

                    CHILDREN
               That’s right! Yes! That’s what
               happened! Someone erased it!

                    JEDI CHILD MAY
               If the planet blew up, the gravity
               would go away.

OBI-WAN stares; YODA chuckles.

                    YODA
               Truly wonderful, the mind of a
               child is. Uncluttered. To the
               centre of the pull of gravity go,
               and find your planet you will.

                    OBI-WAN
               But Master Yoda who could have
               erased information from the
               archives? That’s impossible,
               isn’t it?

                    YODA
                    (frowning)
               Much harder to answer, that
               question is.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, WATER SPEEDER, LANDING PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON
A water speeder driven by PADDY ACCU, the retreat caretaker, skims across the lake away from the island landing platform where a chrome Naboo Starship rests. ANAKIN and PADME are sitting in the speeder as it skims away to where a lodge rises on a beautiful island in the middle of the lake.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN TERRACEM LATE AFTERNOON
ANAKIN and PADME walk up the stairs from where the water speeder is parked onto a terrace overlooking a lovely garden. Behind them, PADDY ACCU supervises two serving girls, NANDI and TECKLA, as they carry the bags into the Lodge.

ANAKIN and PADME stop at the balustrade. PADME looks out across the garden to the shimmering lake and the mountains rising beyond. ANAKIN looks at her silently.

                    PADMÉ
               When I was in Level Three, we used
               to come here for school retreat.
               See that island? We used to swim
               there every day. I love the water.

                    ANAKIN
               I do too. I guess it comes from
               growing up on a desert planet.

PADME becomes aware that ANAKIN is looking at her.

                    PADMÉ
               ...We used to lie on the sand and
               let the sun dry us... and try to
               guess the names of the birds
               singing.

                    ANAKIN
               I don’t like sand. It’s coarse
               and rough and irritating, and it
               gets everywhere. Not like here.
               Here everything’s soft... and
               smooth...

He touches her arm. PADME has become receptive to the way he looks at her but is nervous.

                    PADMÉ
               There was a very old man who lived
               on the island. He used to make
               glass out of sand - and vases and
               necklaces out of the glass. They
               were magical.

                    ANAKIN
                    (looks into her eyes)
               Everything here is magical.

                    PADMÉ
               You could look into the glass and
               see the water. The way it ripples
               and moves. It looked so real...
               but it wasn’t.

                    ANAKIN
               Sometimes, when you believe
               something to be real, it becomes
               real. Real enough, anyway...

They look into each other's eyes. He touches her chin.

                    PADMÉ
               I used to think if you looked too
               deeply into glass, you would
               lose yourself.

                    ANAKIN
               I think it's true...

ANAKIN kisses PADME. She doesn't resist. She comes to her senses and pulls away.

                    PADMÉ
               I shouldn't have done that.

                    ANAKIN
               I'm sorry. When I'm around you,
               my mind is no longer my own.

                    PADMÉ
               It's the situation... the stress...

He looks at her.

                    ANAKIN
               ...the view.

EXT. CORUSCANT, LANDING PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON
Obi-Wan's Starfighter is ready for takeoff. OBI-WAN and MACE WINDU stand beside it.

                    MACE WINDU
               Be wary, this disturbance in the
               Force is growing stronger.

                    OBI-WAN
               I am concerned for my Padawan. He
               is not ready to be on his own.

                    YODA
               The Council is confident in this decision,
               Obi-Wan.

                    MACE
               He has exceptional skills. The
               Council is confident in its
               decision, Obi-Wan. If the
               prophecy is true, he weill be the
               one to bring balance to the Force.

                    OBI-WAN
               But he still has much to learn.
               And his abilities have made him...
               well... arrogant. I realise now
               what you and Master Yoda knew from
               the beginning... the boy was too
               old to start the training and...

OBI-WAN hesitates.

                    MACE WINDU
               There's something else?

                    OBI-WAN
               Master, he should not have been
               given this assignment. I'm afraid
               Anakin won't be able to protect
               the Senator. 

                    MACE WINDU
               Why?

                    OBI-WAN
               He has a... an emotional
               connection with her. It's been
               there since he was boy. Now
               he's confused... distracted.

                    MACE-WINDU
               Obi-Wan, you must have faith that
               he will take the right path.

OBI-WAN climbs into the cockpit of the Starfighter.

                    OBI-WAN
               Has Master Yoda gained any insight
               into whether or not this war will
               come about?

                    MACE WINDU
               Probing the Dark Side is a
               dangerous process. He could be in
               seclusion for days... May the
               force be with you.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, YODA'S QUARTERS - LATE AFTERNOON
YODA sits with his eyes closed, meditating. Silence.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LOUNGE, LATE AFTERNOON
The setting sun touches the mountain peaks. The lake glows in the rose-tinted light. Floatinf lamps glean softly like jewels at the lodge.

INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
NANDI place dessert in front of PADME. TECKLA does the same for ANAKIN. The dessert is some kind of fruit. PADME picks up her fork and goes to spear a piece, but it moves! She frowns and tries again -the fruit moves. She lokk up at ANAKIN. His eyes are on his plate.

                    PADME
               You did that?

ANAKIN looks up - wide-eyed innocence.

                    ANAKIN
               What?

PADME scowls at him. PADME jabs at the fruit - ANAKIN subtly moves his hand and it lifts up from the plate and hovers in front of her.

                    PADME
               That! Now stop it!

PADME laughs. ANAKIN laughs. She reaches out for the fruit - it loops.

                    PADME
                    (continuing)
               Anakin!!

ANAKIN moves his fingers. The fruit flies into his hand.

                    ANAKIN
               I'm not really supposed to do
               that... for fun, I mean. If
               Master Obi-Wan were here, he'd be
               very grumpy.

ANAKIN is pleased. He cuts the fruint into several pieces and sends one back to PADME. She bites it out of the air and laughs.

INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, FIREPLACE ALCOVE - TWILIGHT
A fire blazes in the open hearth. PADME is sitting in front of it, gazing at the flames.

She looks up as ANAKIN arrives. She makes room for him. Brief pause.

                    ANAKIN
               May I tell you something?

                    PADME
               I don't know.

                    ANAKIN
               Then how can I tell you?

                    PADME
               Maybe you should use your Jedi
               intuition.

                    ANAKIN
               It doesn't work around you. My
               mind is always a muddle... I can
               only think of you.

                    PADME
               Anakin, don't...

                    ANAKIN
               From the moment I met you, all
               those years ago, a day hasn't gone
               by when I haven't thought of you.
               And now that I'm close to you again,
               I'm in agony. The closer I get to
               you, the worse it gets. The
               thought of not being with you
               mskes my stomach turn over - my
               mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I
               can't breathe. I'm haunted by the
               kiss you should never have given
               me. My heart is beating, hoping
               that kiss will not become a scar.
               You are in my very soul,
               tormenting me. What can I do? I
               will do anything you ask...

Silence. The logs flame in the hearth.

                    ANAKIN
                    (continuing)
               If you are suffering as much as I
               am, tell me.

                    PADME
               ...I can't. We can't. It's just
               not possible.

                    ANAKIN
               Anything's possible. Padme,
               please listen...

                    PADME
               You listen. We live in a real
               world. Come back to it. You're
               studying to become a Jedi Knight.
               I'm a Senator. If you follow your
               thoughts through to conclusion,
               they will take us to a place we
               cannot go... regardless of the way
               we feel about each other.

                    ANAKIN
               Then you do feel something!
               There's an extraordinary
               connection between us. You can't
               deny that.

                    PADME
               Annie, it doesn't make any
               difference. Jedi aren't allowed
               to marry. You swore an oath,
               remember? You'd be expelled from
               the Order. I will not let you
               give up your responsibilities...
               your future, for me.

                    ANAKIN
               I was destined to be a Jedi. I
               don't think I could be anything
               else. But you are asking me to be
               rational. That is something I
               know I cannot do. I wish I could
               wish my feelings away... but I
               can't.

                    PADME
               I am not going to give into this.
               I'm not going to throw my life
               away. I have more important things
               to do than fall in love.

There is silence as they stare at the fire. ANAKIN is thinking.

                    ANAKIN
               It wouldn't have to be that way...
               we could keep it a secret.

                    PADME
               Then we'd be living a lie - one we
               couldn't keep even if we wanted
               to. Mt sister saw it. So did my
               mother. I couldn't do that.
               Could you, Anakin? Could you live
               like that?

Silence for a moment.

                    ANAKIN
               ...No, you're right. It would
               destroy us.

EXT. SPACE
It's just like the star map hologram, plus the storm-shrouded planet of Kamino, which is exactly where it ought to be. Obi-Wan's Starship flies OVER CAMERA and heads down toward the planet.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY
Heavy rans and hard-driving winds lash the platform as Obi-Wan's Starship approaches. The huge, ultra-modern city of Tipoca rests on great stilts that keep it above the pounding and ever-present waves that cover the surface of this watery world.

The Starfighter lands. OBI-WAN gets out and makes his way through the bowling wind toward a tower on the far side of the platform. A door slides open. A shaft of brilliant light pierces the swirling rain. OBI-WAN passes through it and goes inside.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR ENTRANCE
A Brilliant white light. OBI-WAN pushes the soaking hood from his face.

                    TAUN WE
               Welcome to Tipoca City, Master
               Jedi.

OBI-WAN wipes the rain from his face and blinks in surprise at a tall, pasty-white alien named TAUN WE. He has large, almond shaped eyes.

                    TAUN WE
               Everything is ready. The Prime
               Minister expects you.

                    OBI-WAN
                    (warily)
               I'm expected?

                    TAUN WE
               Of course! He is anxious to see
               you. After all these years, we
               were beginning to think you
               weren't coming. Now please, this
               way!

OBI-WAN masks his surprise as they move away along the corridor.

Obi-Wan follows Taun We cautiously.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, PRIME MINISTER OFFICE - DAY
The door slides open. OBI-WAN and TAUN WE enter and cross to where LAMA SU rises, smiling, from behind his desk, which, like all the furniture on Kamino, seems made out of pure light.

                    TAUN WE
               May I present Lama Su, Prime
               Minister of Kamino... and this is
               Master Jedi...

                    OBI-WAN
               Obi-Wan Kenobi.

                    LAMA SU
               Please...

LAMA SU indicates a chair. OBI-WAN sits. TAUN WE hovers. The room is bathed in brilliant white light. The whole place is ultra high-tech.

                    LAMA SU
               I trust you are going to enjoy
               your stay. We are most happy you
               have arrived at the best part of
               the season.

                    OBI-WAN
               You make me feel most welcome.

                    LAMA SU
               And now to business. You will be
               delighted to hear we are on
               schedule. Two hundred thousand
               units are ready, with another
               million well on the way.

                    OBI-WAN
                    (improvising)
               That is... good news.

                    LAMA SU
               Please tell your Master Sido-Dyas
               that we have every confidence his
               order will be met on time and in
               full. He is well, I hope?

                    OBI-WAN
               I'm sorry Master - ?

                    LAMA SU
               Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas. He's still
               a leading member of the Jedi
               Council, is he not?

                    OBI-WAN
               Oh, yes. Sido-Dyas.

                    LAMA SU
                    (rising)
               You must be anxious to inspect the
               units for yourself.

                    OBI-WAN
               That's why I'm here.

EXT. NABOO, MOUNTAIN MEADOW - LATER AFTERNOON
PADME and ANAKIN are in the middle of an idyllic hilly meadow, its lush grasses sprinkled with flowers. At a distance, a herd of SHAAKS graze contentedly.

Beyond is the shimmering expanse of the lake. Several other lakes stretch to the horizon. The warm air is full of little floating puffballs. They sit on the grass, in a playful, coy mood, talking. PADME is picking flowers.

                    PADMÉ
               I don't know...

                    ANAKIN
               Sure you do... you just don't want
               to tell me.

                    PADMÉ
               Are you going to use one of your
               Jedi mind tricks on me?

                    ANAKIN
               They only work on the weak-minded.
               You are anything but weak-minded.

                    PADMÉ
               All right... his name was Palo.
               I was twelve. We were both in the
               Legislative Youth Program. He was
               a few years older then I... very
               cute... dark curly hair... dreamy
               eyes.

                    ANAKIN
               All right, I get the picture...
               whatever happened to him?

                    PADMÉ
               I went on to become a Queen. He
               went on to become an artist.

                    ANAKIN
               Maybe he was the smart one.

                    PADME
               You really don't like politicians,
               do you?

                    ANAKIN
               I like two or three, but I'm not
               really sure about one of them.
                    (smiling)
               I don't think the system works.

                    PADME
               How would you have it work?

                    ANAKIN
               We need a system where the
               politicians sit down and discuss
               the problems, agree what's in the
               best interests of all the people,
               and then do it.

                    PADME
               That is exactly what we do. The
               trouble is that people don't
               wlways agree. In fact, they
               hardly ever do.

                    ANAKIN
               Then they should be made to.

                    PADME
               By whom? Who's going to make them?

                    ANAKIN
               I don't know. Someone.

                    PADME
               You?

                    ANAKIN
               Of course not me.

                    PADME
               But someone.

                    ANAKIN
               Someone wise.

                    PADME
               That sounds an awful lot like a
               dictatorship to me.

A mischievious little grin creeps across his face.

                    ANAKIN
               Well, if it works...

PADME stares at ANAKIN. He looks back at her, straight-faced, and can't hold a smile.

                    PADMÉ
               You're making fun of me.

                    ANAKIN
                     (sarcastic)
               On no, I'd be much too frightened
               to tease a Senator.

                    PADMÉ
               You're so bad!

PADME picks up a piece of fruit and throws it at him. He catches it. PADME throws two more pieces of fruit, and ANAKIN catches them.

                    ANAKIN
               You're always so serious. Always
               carrying the weight of the
               universe on your shoulders.

ANAKIN then starts to juggle the fruit. PADME laughs and throws more fruit at him. He manages to juggle them too until there are too many, and he loses control and ducks, letting food fall on his head. They both laugh.

ANAKIN stands in front of a SHAAK, yelling at it and waving his arms. PADME starts laughing as ANAKIN runs in circles, chased by the SHAAK.

The SHAAK crosses in front of PADME. ANAKIN is riding it, facing the SHAAK'S tail. The SHAAK bucks, and ANAKIN falls off. PADME laughs even harder. ANAKIN lies still. PADME jumps uip and runs to where ANAKIN is face down in the grass. She turns him over. He is pulling a stupid face at her. She yelps in mock fury and takes a swing at him. He catches her arm. She struggles. They roll over in the grass. Suddenly, they become aware of the contact between them. They let go of each other quickly and sit up, looking away.

ANAKIN stands up and holds out his hand to her. She take it. He pulls her up. And now they are easy together, not self-conscious any more. PADME scrambles up onto the SHAAK behind ANAKIN. She puts her arms around his waist and leans against his back. ABAJUB digs his heels in. The SHAAK starts forward, and they ride away.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, PARADE GROUND (RAINSTORM) - DAY
OBI-WAN, LAMA SU and TAUN WE come out onto a balcony. Below is a huge parade ground. The rain and wind are brutal. THOUSANDS OF STORMTROOPERS, faces covered by helmets, are marching and drilling in formations of several hundred.

                    LAMA SU
                    (beaming)
               Magnificent, aren't they?

OBI-WAN nods slowly.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, COMMINSSARY - DAY
LAMA SU conducts OBI-WAN through a large eating area. TAUN WE follows as they walk by HUNDREDS OF CLONES who look exactly alike, all about twenty years old, dressed in black. They are seated at tables, eating.

                    LAMA SU
               We modified their genetic
               structure to make them less
               independent than the original
               host. As a result they are
               totally obedient, taking any order
               without question.

                    OBI-WAM
               Who was the original host?

                    LAMA SU
               A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.
               We felt a Jedi would be the
               perfect choice, but Sido-Dyas hand-
               picked Jango Fett himself.

                    OBI-WAN
               Where is this bounty hunter now?

                    LAMA SU
               Oh, we keep him here. After a few
               hundred thousand clones, the
               genetic pattern starts to fade, so
               we take a fresh supply. He lives
               here, but he's free to come and go
               as he pleases.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, BARRACKS - DAY
The tour continues through a long corridor folled with narrow, transparent tubes into which CLONES are climbing. Once in the tube, the CLONE goes to sleep.

                    LAMA SU
               Apart from his pay, which is
               considerable, Fett demanded only
               one thing - an unaltered clone for
               himself. Curious isn't it?

                    OBI-WAN
               Unaltered?

                    LAMA SU
               Pure genetic replication. No
               tampering with the structure to
               make it more docile... and no
               growth acceleration...

                    OBI-WAN
               I would like to meet this Jango
               Fett.

                    TAUN WE
               I would be most happy to arrange
               it, for you.

TAUN WE bows, and leaves.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, CLASSROOM - DAY
The tour continues through a classroom filled with IDENTICAL YOUNG BOY CLONES.

                    OBI-WAN
               You mentioned growth
               acceleration...

                    LAMA SU
               Oh yes, it's essential.
               Otherwise, a mature clone would
               take a lifetime to grow. Now, we
               can do it in half the time. Those
               items you saw on the parade ground
               were started ten years ago, when
               Sido-dyas first placed the order,
               and they're already mature...

OBI-WAN looks at the BOY CLONES.

                    OBI-WAN
               And these?

                    LAMA SU
               About five years ago.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, HATCHERY - DAY
They enter a space filled with great racks of glass spheres, which are filled with fluid in which EMBRYOS are suspended.

                    LAMA SU
               They're immensely superior to
               droids, capable of independent
               thought and action.

                    OBI-WAN
               Very impressive.

                    LAMA SU
               I'd hoped you would be pleased. 

OBI-WAN gazes at the nearest embryos.

                    OBI-WAN
                    (carefully)
               Tell me, prime minister, when my
               Master Sido-dyas first contacted
               you, did he say the order was
               for... himself... or?

                    LAMA SU
               Himself? Of course not. This
               army is for the Republic?

                    OBI-WAN
                    (astonished)
               The Repubic?

                    LAMA SU
               We are also very much agasint this
               Count Dooku and his seccessionist
               movement. We are proud to be of
               help to the Republic.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, APARTMENT - LATE DAY
TAUN WE shows OBI-WAN into his room.

                    TAUN WE
               I have arranged for you to meet
               Jango Fett in the morning. Sleep
               well.

TAUN WE goes. The door slides closed behind him. OBI-WAN looks around, then moves swiftly to check the room over. Finally, satisfied, he takes out his comlink.

                    OBI-WAN
               Arfour, Arfour...

EXT. TIPOCA CITY LANDING PLATFORM, JEDI FIGHTER, (RAINSTORM) - LATE DAY
The R4 D17, Obi-Wan's Astro-Droid, who is sitting on top of Obi-Wan's Starfighter, switches on and BEEPS.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, APARTMENT - LATE DAY
OBI-WAN hears ARFOUR BEEP through his comlink.

                    OBI-WAN
               Arfour, relay this, "scramble code
               five," to Courscant: care of "the
               old folks home."

EXT. TIPOCA CITY LANDING PLATFORM, JEDI FIGHTER, (RAINSTORM) - LATE DAY
ARFOUR BEEPS and WHISTLES. The panels light up inside the cockpit, as the message is transmitted.

EXT. JEDI TEMPLE, LIVINF QUARTERS - EARLY EVENING
YODA and MACE WINDU listen as a hologram of OBI-WAN stands between them broadcasting the massage. The singnal is very weak, the image fades in and out.

                    OBI-WAN (V.O.)
               ...I've never heard of a Jedi
               called Sido-Dyas, have you, Master?

                    MACE WINDU
               No. Whoever placed that order was
               not a Jedi, I can assure you.

                    OBI-WAN (V.O.)
               I have a strong feeling that this
               bounty hunter is the assassin
               we're looking for.

                    YODA
               Who he is working for... discover
               that, you must.

                    OBI-WAN (V.O.)
               I will, Master, and I will also
               find out more about this clone
               army... May The Force...

The hologram switches off, and OBI-WAN fades away.

                    WINDU 
               A clone army! Ordered by someone
               in the Senate perhaps... Someone's
               out to start a war.

                    YODA
               Inform the chancellor of this, we
               must.

                    WINDU
               Who do you think this impostor
               Sido-Dyas, could be?

YODA stares back at MACE WINDU, then slowly shakes his head.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT - NIGHT
The silent lodge. The triple moons of Naboo reflected in the tranquil waters of the lake.

INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, ANAKIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
ANAKIN moves restlessly in his sleep. He mutters to himself. Sweat 
forms on his forehead. He turns violently. He cries out.

                    ANAKIN
               No...No...No...Mom!...Don't,
               no, don't!

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, BALCONY OVERLOOKING GARDENS - MORNING
ANAKIN is on the balcony overlooking the gardens. After a moment, PAMDE comes onto the balcony behind him. She sees he is meditating and turns to go.

                    ANAKIN
                    (eyes closed)
               Don't go.

                    PAMDE
               I don't want to disturb you.

                    ANAKIN
               Your presence is soothing.

Brief pause.

                    PADME
               You had a nightmare again last
               night.

                    ANAKIN
               Jedi don't have nightmares.

                    PADME
               I heard you.

ANAKIN'S opens his eyes and looks at her.

                    ANAKIN
               I saw my mother. I saw her as
               clearly as I see you now. She's
               suffering, Padme. She is in
               pain...They're killing her!
                    (getting up)
               I know I'm disobeying my mandate
               to protect you, Senator. I know I
               will be punished and possibly
               thrown out of the Jedi Order, but
               I must go. I have to help her!
               I'm sorry, Padme. I don't have a
               choice.

                    PADME
               Annie, I told you I wouldn't let
               you give up your future for me.
               I'll go with you. That way you
               can continue to protect me, and
               you won't be disobeying your
               mandate.

                    ANAKIN
               What about Master Obi-wan?

PADME smiles and takes his hand.

                    PADME
               I guess we won't tell him, will we?

EXT. NABOO LAKE, FLOATING LANDING PLATFORM - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME step onto the landing platform from the water speeder. They enter the Naboo Starship. ARTOO BEEPS, and follows them on board. The ramp retracts.

PADDY ACCU drives the water speeder away from the platform as Anakin's Starship takes off.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY (RAINSTORM) - DAY
Rain lashes the city. Below, mightly waves pound the stilts, breaking almost to the height of the platforms.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY
TAUN WE conducts OBI-WAN to the door of Jango Fett's apartment. TAUN WE waves his hand, and a muted bell RINGS.

As they wait, OBI-WAN notes the door lock entry mechanism. Then the door opens, and a ten-year-old boy, BOBA FETT, looks at them. He is identical to the boys in the classroom.

                    TAUN WE
               Boba, is your father here?

There is a brief pause, then BOBA FETT nods.

                    TAUN WE
                    (continuing)
               May we see him?

                    BOBA FETT
               Sure.

Another brief pause, then BOBA FETT steps aside, and TAUN WE and OBI-WAN go through.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT - DAY
OBI-WAN, TAUN WE, and BOBA FETT enter the apartment. OBI-WAN looks around the room.

                    BOBA FETT
               Dad! Taun We's here!

JANGO FETT comes in from the bedroom. He wears a jumpsuit. He is unshaven and mean looking, his face pitted with scars of old wounds. There are a couple of weird tattoos on his muscular forearms. He eyes OBI-WAN with suspicion.

                    TAUN WE
               Welcome back, Jango. Was your
               trip productive?

                    JANGO FETT
               Fairly.

OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT size each other up. BOBA FETT studies both of them.

                    TAUN WE
               This is Jedi Master, Obi-Wan
               Kenobi. He's come to check on our
               progress.

                    JANGO FETT
               That right?

JANGO FETT'S eyes fix OBI-WAN coldly.

                    OBI-WAN
               Your clones are very impressive.
               You must be very proud.

                    JANGO FETT
               I'm just a simple man, trying to
               make my way in the universe,
               Master Jedi.

                    OBI-WAN
               Aren't we all?

OBI-WAN eyes the half-open bedroom door, through which a couple of pieces of body armour can be seen on the floor. JANGO FETT registers OBI-WAN'S look. He moves in front of him, blocking the view.

                    OBI-WAN
                    (continuing)
               Ever made your way as far into the
               interior as Coruscant?

                    JANGO
               Once or twice.

                    OBI-WAN
               Recently?

                    JANGO
                    (eyes Obi-Wan carefully)
               Possibly...

                    OBI-WAN
               Then you must know Master Sido-
               Dyas?

                    JANGO
               Boba, close the door.

BOBA FETT moves to close the bedroom door. JANGO FETT smiles thinly at OBI-WAN.

                    JANGO
                    (continuing)
               Master who?

                    OBI-WAN
               Sido-Dyas. Isn’t he the Jedi who
               hired you for this job?

                    JANGO
               Never heard of him. I was
               recuited by a man called Darth
               Tyranus on one of the moons of
               Bogden.

                    OBI-WAN
               No? I thought...

                    TAUN WE
               Sido-Dyas told us to expect him.
               And he showed up just when your
               Jedi Master said he would. We
               have kept the Jedi’s involvement
               a secret until your arrival, just
               as your Master requested.

                    OBI-WAN
               Curious...

                    JANGO
               Do you like your army?

                    OBI-WAN
               It seems to me it's your army -
               being that they are all clones of
               you.

                    JANGO
                    (grinning)
               They'll do their job well, I'll
               guarantee that.

                    OBI-WAN
               I look forward to seeing them in
               action. Thank you for your time,
               Jango.

                    JANGO
               Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.

OBI-WAN and TAUN WE go out. The door slides closed. JANGO FETT turns to his son. He is deep in thought.

                    BOBA
               What is it, Dad?

EXT. SPACE
The Naboo Starship heads toward the desert planet of Tatooine.

EXT. TATOOINE, MOS ESPA STREETS AND WATTO'S SHIP - DAY
The Naboo Starship lands in a large parking lot of Spaceships on the outskirts of Mos Espa. ANAKIN and PADME ride a rickshaw through the streets. ANAKIN stares at sights he hasn't seen for years. Finally, they come  to Wattos' shop, and the rickshaw stops.

                    ANAKIN
                    (to the droid driver)
               Wait, please.

ANAKIN and PADME get down. Sitting on a stool in front of the shop is WATTO. He is using a small electronic screwdriver on a fiddly DROID. THREE PIT DROIDS are chattering away and are trying to help him, but they seem only to make him madder.

                    WATTO
                    (yelling, in Huttese)
               No, not that one - that one!

                    ANAKIN
                    (arriving)
               Excuse me, Watto.

                    WATTO
                    (in Huttese)
               What?

                    ANAKIN
                    (in Huttese)
               I said excuse me.

WATTO turns to the chattering PIT DROIDS.

                    WATTO
                    (in Huttese)
               Shut down.

The PIT DROIDS snap into their storage position.

                    WATTO
                    (continuing, in Huttese)
               What? I don't know you... What can
               I do for you? You look like a
               Jedi. Whatever it is... I didn't
               do it.

WATTO drops the screwdriver and curses loudly in Huttese

                    ANAKIN
               Let me help you with that.

ANAKIN takes the fiddly piece of equipment and starts to play with it. WATTO blinks in surprise.

                    ANAKIN
                    (continuing)
               I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.

WATTO looks at him suspiciously. He stares at PADME, then back to ANAKIN.

                    WATTO
               Annie?? Little Annie?? Naaaah!!

Suddenly, the fiddly piece of equipment in Anakin's hands WHIRS into life. WATTO blinks at it.

                    WATTO
                    (continuing; in English)
               You are Annie! It is you! You
               little womp rat.

WATTO gives ANAKIN a big hug.

                    WATTO
                    (continuing)
               You sure sprouted Weehoo! A
               Jedi! Waddya know? Hey, maybe
               you couldda help wit some
               daedbeats who owe...

                    ANAKIN
               My mother...

                    WATTO
               Oh, yeah. Shmi... she's not mine
               no more. I sold her.

                    ANAKIN
               Sold her...

                    WATTO
               Years ago. Sorry, Anne, but you
               know, business is business.
               Sold her to a moisture farmer
               named Lars. Least I think it was
               Lars. Believe it or not, I heard
               he freed her and married her. Can
               ya beat that?

                    ANAKIN
               Do you know where they are?

                    WATTO
               Long way from here... someplace
               over on the other side of Mos
               Eisley, I think...

                    ANAKIN
               I'd like to know.

ANAKIN'S grim look means business; WATTO gets the hint quickly.

                    WATTO
               Yeah... sure... absolutely. Let's
               go look in my records.

ANAKIN and WATTO go into the shop.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY (RAINSTORM) - DAY
The waves crash against the water city as the storm continues. Light suddenlyt streams from the base of a landing platform as a door slides open.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY
OBI-WAN stands with LAMA SU and TAUN WE just inside the open door.

                    LAMA SU
               Tell your Council the first
               battalions are ready. And remind
               them that if they need more
               troops, we will need time to grow
               them.

                    OBI-WAN
               I won't forget.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY
OBI-WAN comes out from the tower into the driving ran. The door closes behind him. He pulls his robe around him and stands braced against the gale.

Below, a huge wave crashes against the stilts. Spray flies high and whips across the platform where OBI-WAN is standing. He walks over to his Starfighter, looks to see if anyone is watching, then turns and goes back to the door. It slides open.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY
OBI-WAN enters cautiously from outside. Ahead, the corridor is deserted. He moves down it.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT - DAY
OBI-WAN walks in to find the room in complete disorder. The bedroom door is wide open - clear signs of hurried departure. All of the Fetts' personal belongings are gone.

OBI-WAN goes to an ultra-thin computer screen. He punches up AN ONSCREEN PICTURE of JANGO FETT and BOBA FETT unhitching the lines securing their ship to the landing platform. JANGO FETT is wearing his armour and rocket pack. BOBA FETT climbs aboard the small Fighter.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY
JANGO FETT picks up a case and swings it up to BOBA FETT, who stows it inside the ship. JANGO FETT picks up another case and is about to swing it, when:

                    BOBA FETT
               Dad!!

JANGO FETT turns to see OBI-WAN charging out of the tower toward him. As he runs, OBI-WAN draws his lightsaber from his belt. It flashes on.

JANGO FETT draws his gun and fires at the charging JEDI. OBI-WAN deflects the blast and swings at JANGO FETT.

The bounty hunter rockets up and over OBI-WAN, landing behind him. He fires a thin wire from his wrist pack, trying to entangle the Jedi.

JANGO FETT fire several Kamino Kyber Darts from his elbow launcher. OBI-WAN deflects them back at JANGO FETT, but they strike harmlessly against the bounty hunter's armour.

IN THE COCKPIT of Jango Fett's ship, BOBA FETT grabs the controls of a laser gun and swings it to aim at OBI-WAN.

OUTSIDE, in the driving rain, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT circle each other, sizing each other up - feinting.

IN THE COCKPIT, each time BOBA FETT is ready to fire, JANGO FETT blocks his view of OBI-WAN.

OUTSIDE, OBI-WAN makes a sudden attack, swinging at JANGO FETT, who deflects the blows. One slices off a piece of the bounty hunter's shoulder plate. JANGO FETT rockets into the air and hovers above OBI-WAN. The Jedi spins as:

IN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT fires.

OUTSIDE, the laser shell streaks past OBI-WAN to strike the edge of the tower. JANGO FETT fires down at OBI-WAN. The Jedi deflects the shots back, but JANGO FETT evades them. Then he swoops down, swinging around OBI-WAN. As he shoots past, he kicks the lightsaber out of the Jedi's hand.

The lightsaber skids across the wet surface of the landing platform. OBI-WAN dives after it. JANGO FETT zooms in front of him and grabs the lightsaber. OBI-WAN punches it out of his hand.

IN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT watches as:

OUTSIDE, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT grapple and fight, punching, kicking, grabbing hold, and throwing each other around. OBI-WAN grabs JANGO FETT tightly, and JANGO FETT rockets up into the air and kicks OBI-WAN loose. OBI-WAN crashes to the deck and slides toward the edge. He grapples desperately for a handhold on the slick surface.

JANGO FETT rockets down to kick at him. OBI-WAN hauls himself up. JANGO FETT zooms to the far side of the platform.

OBI-WAN uses Jedi powers to pull part of the structure loose. It hits JANGO FETT, who loses his balance, teetering on the edge. OBI-WAN charges acress, dives, and grabs hold of JANGO FETT just as he falls over the edge.

Locked together, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT plummet down toward the raging ocean. At the last moment, JANGO FETT fires a cable out of his backpack that shoots upward and locks onto a metal strut on the underside of the platform. OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT swing and CRASH onto one of the stilts.

OBI-WAN is knocked clear and drops onto a SMALL SERVICE PLATFORM just above the waves. He hauls himself to his feet. JANGO FETT hovers in mid-air opposite him, as a HUGE WAVE crashes over OBI-WAN. When it subsides, the Jedi has disappeared.

JANGO FETT rockets up to the landing platform, where he drops down beside his ship. He clambers inside the cockpit and settles into the pilot's seat. He punches buttons. The engines ROAR.

OUTSIDE, Jango Fett's ship lifts off from the platform and heads up into the lowering sky. It disappears. Lightning flashes. Rain lashes the tower and streams across the surface of the platform, to where:

A HAND suddenlt clutches at the very edge of the platform. A moment later, ANOTHER HAND grabs hold.

EXT. TATOOINE, BLUFF OVERLOOKING HOMESTEAD - LATE DAY
The Naboo Starship descends, hovers, and land on a bluff. ANAKIN and PADME get out. They look down from the edge of the bluff to where the homestead is seen on the desert floor below.

                    PADME
               Stay with the ship, Artoo.

ARTOO WHISTLES as ANAKIN and PADME start down the trail toward the homestead.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY
C-3PO is working outside the homestead. He still lacks an outer covering; his inner parts and wiring show. He looks up as ANAKIN and PADME arrive,

                    C-3PO
               Good evening. May I help you?

                    ANAKIN
               Threepio?

                    C-3PO
               Oh, my... oh, my! Master
               Anakin! My goodness, I can hardly
               believe it! And this must be Miss
               Padme.

                    PADME
               Hello, Threepio.

                    ANAKIN
               I've come to see my mother.

                    C-3PO
               Oh, dear! I'm so terribly sorry,
               Master Annie.

                    PADME
               Threepio, what's happened?

                    C-3PO
               I think we'd better go inside.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, COURTYARD - LATE DAY
ANAKIN, PADME and THREEPIO arrive in the courtyard. THREEPIO shuffles ahead.

                    C-3PO
               Master Lars - Master Owen!
               Somebody to see you!

OWEN LARS and BERU WHITESUN come out into the courtyard.

                    ANAKIN
               I'm Anakin Skywalker. I'm here
               looking for my mother.

                    OWEN
               Owen Lars... I guess I'm your
               step-brother.
                    (they shake hands)
               This is my girlfriend, Beru.

                    BERU
               Hello.

                    PADME
               I'm Padme.

                    OWEN
               I had a feeling you might show up
               some day.

                    ANAKIN
               Is my mother here?

                    CLIEGG
               No, she's not.

CLIEGG LARS swings from the house on a small floating chair. One of his legs is heavily bandaged; the other is missing. He balances awkwardly and puts out a hand.

                    CLIEGG
                    (continuing)
               Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife...
               Come on inside. We have a lot to
               talk about.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, KITCHEN - LATE DAY
BERU puts several steaming cups of ardees on a tray and exits the kitchen...

                    CLIEGG (O.S.)
               It was just before dawn. They
               came out of nowhere. A hunting
               party of Tusekn Raiders.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, DINING AREA - LATE DAY
CLIEGG, OWEN, PADME and ANAKIN sit around the table, BERU brings the drinks from the kitchen.

                    CLIEGG
               Your mother had gone out early,
               like she always did, to pick
               mushrooms that grow on the
               vaporatos. From the tracks, she
               was about halfway when they
               took her. Those Tuskens walk like
               men, but they're vicious, mindless
               monsters. Thirty of us went out
               after her. Four of us came back.
               Three more are still out there
               looking. I'd be with them,
               only... I just couldn't ride any
               more... until I heal.

CLIEGG grimaces, easing his throbbing leg.

                    CLIEGG
                    (continuing)
               This isn't the way I wanted to
               meet you, son. This isn't how
               your mother and I planned it. I
               don't want to give up on her, but
               she's been gone a month. There's
               little hope she's lasted this long.

Silence. Then ANAKIN stands up.

                    OWEN
               Where are you going?

                    ANAKIN
               To find my mother.

                    PADME
               No, Annie!

                    CLIEGG
               She's daed, son. Accept it.

                    ANAKIN
               I can feel her pain, and I will
               find her. I know she's alive.

ANAKIN turns abruptly.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY
ANAKIN stands looking across the desert. PADME comes running out of the homestead after him, followed by OWEN. ANAKIN turns to PADME.

                    ANAKIN
               You are going to have to stay
               here. These are good people,
               Padme. You'll be safe.

                    OWEN
               Take my speeder bike.

                    PADME
               Anakin...

PADME hugs him. ANAKIN walks over to Owen's speeder bike, which is standing close by.

                    ANAKIN
               I trust you'll watch over her,
               Owen.

                    OWEN
               Don't worry.

ANAKIN swings onto the bike. The engine fires.

                    ANAKIN
               I won't be long.

ANAKIN takes off across the desert. PADME watches him go.

EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS
The red planet of Geonosis is circled by a large asteroid field that form rings. Jango Fett's ship appears, heading toward it.

INT. COCKPIT, FETT SHIP, SPACE, GEONOSIS
JANGO FETT grins at BOBA FETT.

                    JANGO FETT
               Nearly there, son.

JANGO FETT guides he ship around the asteroids. Suddenly:

                    BOBA FETT
               Dad, look!!

On the view screen, Obi-Wan's ship appears, chasing after them. JANGO FETT grabs the controls. They are thrown around as the ship plummets to try to lose OBI-WAN.

                    JANGO FETT
               Hang on!

The ship goes into a power-climb. A GREAT SPACE DDOGFIGHT ensues between OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT.

EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS
The ships flip, roll, and turn at incredible speed, didging, weaving and firing. They tumble from near misses. Hits fly off Obi-Wan's fighter as one of Jango's missiles gets through.

Finally, it seems as if OBI-WAN is getting the upper hand. JANGO FETT breaks off the fight and dives sharply. He maneuvers deftly between two huge asteroids.

In JANGO FETT'S COCKPIT, BOBA FETT flinches as asteroids pass very close by.

                    BOBA FETT
               Dad! Watch out!

                    JANGO FETT
               Stay calm, son. We'll be fine.
               That Jedi won't be able to follow
               us through this.

But Obi-Wan ship dives into the asteroid belt after them.

IN OBI-WAN'S COCKPIT, his skill is pushed to the limit as he throws the ship from side to side, avoiding great rocks. Then a huge asteroid tumbles across his path. There seem no way he can avoid it. OBI-WAN fires a couple of aerial torpedoes. They streak toward the asteroid.

IN JANGO'S COCKPIT, they see the huge explosion as Obi-Wan's ship appears to smash into the asteroid.

                    BOBA FETT
               Got him! Yeahhhhh!

                    JANGO FETT
               We won't see him again.

BOBA FETT laughs. Jango Fett's ship emerges from the asteroid belt and heads down toward the planet of Geonosis.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, JAWA CAMP - SUNSET
ANAKIN stands in the middle of a crowd of JAWAS. He asks them from directions. The JAWAS confer exicitedly, then the CHIEF JAWA points in a particular direction. ANAKIN gets on the bike and speeds off to where the JAWA pointed.

EXT. TATOOINE, DUNE SEA, CAMPFIRE - TWILIGHT
ANAKIN rides over a large dune toward a small flickering light in the distance.

He rides up and stops the bike in front of a campfire. There are bodies of THREE DEAD FARMERS lying beside the campfire. TWO EOPIES are thethered nearby, along with a burned and smoking speeder.

EXT. TATOOINE, LANDSCAPE (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
THREE DIFFERENT SHOTS. ANAKIN rids the speeder bike through three exotic landscapes. In one shot, he stops and looks down at some tracks. Then he starts up his speeder and rides off.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
The lights of the vaporators blink in the night sky. Somewhere close by, a night animal HOWLS.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, COURTYARD (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
PADME is pacing the courtyard restlessly. She stops, listening to the animal HOWLING nearby. She shivers slightly, then turns and goes into the garage at the side of the courtyard.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD - GARAGE (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
PADME stands looking at a speeder parked in the garage. Short silence. Then:

                    C-3PO
               Please don't leave us, Miss Padme.
               These people need your help.

THREEPIO is parked in a corner.

                    PADME
               I'm not leaving, Threepio. I just
               can't sleep.

                    C-3PO
               That's something I cannot relate
               to. As a Protocol Droid, I'm
               either active or inactive.
               There's no in-between.

                    PADME
               I guess you're lucky.

                    C-3PO
               Do you really think so..? I
               suppose I shouldn't expect...

                    PADME
               You're not happy here?

                    C-3PO
               Oh, I'm not unhappy... and my
               masters here ar so kind I
               wouldn't wish to trouuble them,
               it's just... being like this...
               well, it's embarrassing.

                    PADME
               Being like what?

                    C-3PO
               Naked. If you pardon the
               expression. You see, when Master
               Annie made me, he never quite
               found the time to give me any
               outer covering. It's so
               humiliating. How would you like it
               if you had to go around with all
               your circuits showing?

                    PADME
               I guess I wouldn't like it at all.

                    C-3PO
               Of course you wouldn't. Nobody
               would. It's simply not protocol.

PADME looks thoughtfully at a pile of spare parts and bits of metal and tools.

                    PADME
               Maybe we can do something about it.

                    C-3PO
               I don't think so. Only Master
               Annie...

                    PADME
               Why not? They seem to have a box
               of old coverings here.

                    C-3PO
               Oh? How observant of you, Miss
               Padme. Of course, I'm just not
               mechanically minded... if you see
               what I mean.

PADME picks up a piece of metal and holds it against him.

                    PADME
               Let's see, if we put this...
               here...

                    C-3PO
               Ooooh! That's tickles.

                    PADME
               You'll have to be quiet, Threepio.
               Hold still, please.

EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS RINGS
A huge chunk of rock tumbles slowly through the asteroid bely. CAMERA CLOSES, to discover Obi-Wan's Starship hidden in a blasted-out area on the pitted back side of the great rock.

INT. COCKPIT, JEDI FIGHTER, SPACE, GEONOSIS RINGS
OBI-WAN looks out toward Geonosis and sees in the distance a large fleet of Trade Federation Ships hidden among the asteroids. He starts the engines of his fighter.

Obi-Wan's Fighter moves out from the back side of the asteroid and heads away from the asteroid field, descending toward Geonosis.

EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA - NIGHT
Obi-Wan's ship skims across the top of a small mesa along the edge of a rocky ridge. He maneuvers under a rock overhang and lands. He gets out of the Fighter and walks onto the mesa. The wind whips at him. He looks around.

Geonosis is a red rock planet, featureless apart from buttes and mesas, and occasional tall stalagmites that stand out dramatically on the arid plains.

The night is quiet, except for an occasional WEIRD CRY. OBI-WAN checks his bearings, then heads away.

EXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL - NIGHT
OBI-WAN climbs a steep, narrow trail. Suddenly, a CRY is heard close by. OBI-WAN stumbles slightly. His foot slips on the edge, sending a stream of peblles skittering into the darkness.

OBI-WAN listens. Silence. He draws his lightsaber but does not ignite it.

He sets off again and works his way around a narrow corner, to confront a crouching MASSIFF (a dog-sized lizard) with slavering fangs! The beast leaps at him, and OBI-WAN ignites his lightsaber as the MASSIFF knocks him on his back. Its jaws open wide. OBI-WAN stabs the creature, throws it off of him, and jumps up.

A SECOND MASSIFF jumps from behind. OBI-WAN swings around and cuts it in half. The MASSIFF flies over the cliff, HOWLING. It plummets to its death hundreds of feet below.

EXT. TATOOINE, CLIFF (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
ANAKIN pulls up near the edge of a cliff. He gets off the bike and creeps to the edge. He looks over to see a Tusken camp in the oasis below. One of the huts at the edge of the camp has TWO TUSKEN GUARDS outside it.

EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
ANAKIN creeps through the camp, working his way from hut to hut, flattening himself against the wall,s overhearing snatches of Tusken conversation from inside, using the shadows to him him until he arrives at the hut with the TWO GUARDS. They are sitting a short distance from the door. ANAKIN wriggles around the black. He takes out his lightsaber and cuts into the base of the wall.

INT. TUSKEN RAIDER HUTT - NIGHT
The lightsaber completes the hole in the wall. ANAKIN wriggles in. He pulls himself to his feet. There are candles everywhere.

A shaft of moonlight from a hole in the roof pierces the gloom of the hut. By its light, ANAKIN sees SHMI, hanging from a wooden frame in the middle of the hut.

He cuts her free, takes her into his arms, and lowers her gently to the ground. Her eyes are closed. Her face is bloodied. She has been 
terribly beaten. Anakin cradles her tenderly.

                    ANAKIN
               Mom... Mom... Mom... 

SHMI'S eyelids flutter - and barely open. They are caked with blood.

                    SHMI
               Annie...? Is it you?

SHMI'S eyes focus slowly. ANAKIN gives a little choking gasp.

                    ANAKIN
               I’m here, Mom. You’re safe. Hang
               on. I’m going to get you out of
               here...

                    SHMI
               I’m so glad... to see you,
               Annie... Now... I am complete...

                    ANAKIN
               Just stay with me, Mom. I’m going
               to make you well again.
               Everything’s going to be fine.

                    SHMI
               You look so handsome. My son...
               my grown-up son. I’m so proud of
               you, Annie... so proud... I missed
               you so much... I love...

SHMI dies. ANAKIN draws her to his breast. There is silence for a moment. ANAKIN lifts his head, listening for a moment, then he sits on the floor of the Tusken hut, cradling his dead mother in his arms.

EXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL - NIGHT
OBI-WAN arrives at the head of the trail. Far below, a flat plain stretches into the distance. He stop, peering into the darkness, where strange shapes loom indistinctly.

OBI-WAN takes a pair of electronic binoculars from his belt and puts them to his eyes. He sees a cluster of great towers like fantastic stalagmites rise from the plain below.

SLOW PAN with the binoculars, and suddenly a line of Battle Starships come into view. OBI-WAN touches the viewfinder. Between fifty and a hundred Federation Starships in near rows. Some are on platforms that are carrying the Starships diwn to an underground facility. Other platforms are rising to the surface. They carry THOUSANDS of BATTLE DROIDS that step off and file into the waiting ships. A fully loaded Starship takes off. OBI-WAN swings the binoculars upward, to see more Federation Starships.

EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS - DAWN
The pale light grows. Thin tendrils of smoke rise slowly in the cold, clear air. Somewhere an dog BARKS. An OLD WOMAN comes out of one of the huts. She carries a pail. She swirls it and tosses the dirty water onto the ground.

As she goes back inside the hut, a TUSKEN CHILD runs past, dragging a stick in the sand. The CHILD runs through the line of huts, turns a corner, and stops suddenly, staring at the bodies of the TWO TUSKEN GUARDS. Between them, ANAKIN stands outside the hut door. His face is a grim mask. The CHILD stares, then there is a FLASH OF LIGHT as Anakin’s lightsaber switches on.

EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA - NIGHT
OBI-WAN comes running back to his ship and climbs into the cockpit. He settles into his seat. His ARFOUR DROID beeps a happy greeting. OBI-WAN switches on his comlink.

                    OBI-WAN
               "Guiding light" to "old folks
               home."

EXT. CORUSCANT, REPUBLIC EXECUTIVE BUILDING - DAY
LOW ANGLE. A line of reflecting pools with splashing fountains flanked by statues on each side leads to the main entrance to the awesome building.

INT. CORUSCANT, CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE
A hologram of OBI-WAN flickers in front of a group, made up of Jedi (YODA, MACE WINDU, and KI-ADI-MUNDI) and Senators (BAIL ORGANA, ASK AAK, LUMINARA, and JAR JAR). PALPATINE and MAS AMEDDA are in the middle of the group, watching with growing concern.

                    OBI-WAN
               ...Starships from the Trade
               Federation and the Commerce Guilds
               are taking deliveries of battle
               droids from the foundries on
               Geonosis.

                    BAIL ORGANA
               That's outrageous! The treaty
               forbids the Trade Federation from
               building up an army. What are
               they doing?!

                    OBI-WAN
               The droid foundry seems to be
               working at full capacity. I am
               going to go down and investigate.
               I will bring Jango Fett back home
               for interrogation.

                    PALPATINE
               Those Geonosian foundries are part
               of the Techno Union. We will call
               in their representatives and ask
               them a few very pointed questions.

                    OBI-WAN
               One more thing. Jango mentioned
               he was recruited by someone named
               Darth Tyranus. Any idea who that
               might be?

                    YODA
               With the forename Darth, a Sith he
               must be.

                    MACE WINDU
               Our missing apprentice. They are
               playing their hand at last.

                    OBI-WAN
               Do you believe he could be the
               mysterious Sido-Dyas, who made the
               deal for the clone army?

                    YODA
               Perhaps too many pieces are missing
               from this puzzle, there are.

                    MACE WINDU
               Be careful, Obi-Wan. This
               investigation is becoming less
               than routine. Do you need help?

                    OBI-WAN
               Let me see if I can figure out
               what's going on first.

The hologram of OBI-WAN fades off. PALPATINE stares at the spot where the hologram was in disbelief.

                    BAIL ORGANA
               The Commerce Guilds are preparing
               for war... there can be no doubt
               of that.

                    PALPATINE
               Count Dooku must have made a
               treaty with them.

                    MACE WINDU
               We must stop them soon before
               they're fully ready.

                    SENATOR ASK AAK
               The debate is over, we need
               that clone army now!

                    BAIL ORGANA
               Unfortunately, the debate is not
               over. The Senate will never be
               able to approve the use of that
               army before the separatists
               attack.

Mas Amedda, who had been silent up until now suddenly speaks up.

                    MAS AMEDDA
               This is a crisis! If the Senate
               votes the Chancellor emergency
               powers, he could approve the use
               of the army in a minute.

                    PALPATINE
               Please, please, I don't wish to
               have emergency powers. That's too
               extreme a solution. It's akin to
               a dictatorship. We must rely on
               the Jedi. Master Yoda, how many
               are available to go to Geonosis?

MACE WINDU and YODA look at one another.

                    YODA
               Two Hundred,... less or more.

                    BAIL ORGANA
               With all due respect for the Jedi
               Order, two hundred will be no
               match for hundreds of thousands of
               battle droids.

                    MACE WINDU
               Patience. We should wait for Obi-
               Wan to report back. We don't know
               that Count Dooku has made a treaty
               with the Corporate Alliance, it's
               speculation.

                    SENATOR ASK AAK
               But we must prepare for the worst.
               I'm going to propose a motion
               granting emergency powers to the
               Chancellor at the next session. We
               must not wait!

                    PALPATINE
               Out of the question, Senator! You
               and I are too closely aligned.
               The issue will become partisan and
               debates will begin. The proposal
               must come from a neutral source.

                    MAS AMEDDA
               If only Senator Amidala were here.

JAR JAR steps forward from the back of the group.

                    JAR JAR
               Supreme Chancellor... my august
               colleagues, I would be proud to
               propose the motion in question.
               This is a grave situation, and I'm
               sure Senator Amidala, and the
               Queen of Naboo would agree.

                    SENATOR ASK AAK
               Thank you, Representative Binks.

Silence. Then PALPATINE sighs deeply.

                    PALPATINE
               If called upon, I will serve. But
               it will be the saddest day of my
               life.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD MOISTURE FARM - DAY
All is quiet. BERU comes out of the house. She goes to a moisture line and starts to draw water.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GARAGE - DAY
PADME fixes the last piece of covering onto THREEPIO.

                    PADME
               There!

PADME stands back. OWEN is with her. They look at THREEPIO. He isn't the golden figure we know because PADME has had to use whatever stuff she could findin the garage. He is multi-coloured in several textures, but he is complete.

                    C-3PO
               Um. How do I look?

                    OWEN
               Great! You look perfect.

                    C-3PO
               Perfect? Oh, Miss Padme, I'm so
               happy!
                    (extending his hand to shake hers)
               Oh, pardon me.

THREEPIO drops his hand and bows formally.

                    THREEPIO
                    (continuing)
               Thank you.

He forgets formality and hugs her. PADME hugs him back, laughing.

                    C-3PO
                    (continuing)
               Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

                    OWEN
                    (grinning)
               Well, Padme, I think he should be
               yours from now on... I know that
               is what my Mom would want.

                    C-3PO
               Oh, my!

Then suddenly, from outside:

                    BERU (V.O.)
               Come topside, everybody! He's
               back! He's back!

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GARAGE - DAY
A rough hologram of OBI-WAN is projected onto the garage by ARTOO. ANAKIN, PADME and THREEPIO watch the flickering image.

                    OBI-WAN
               ...Alliance have pledged their
               armies to Count Dooku and are
               forming an... Wait!... ah...
               attack... I don't... make it...
               aaaggghhh!

The hologram cuts off. ANAKIN jumps up, agitated.

                    ANAKIN
               I'm going after him!

                    PADME
               I thought the first thing he said
               was to retransmit his message to
               Coruscant.

                    ANAKIN
               Yeah, you're right, you're right.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY
ANAKIN, PADME, ARTOO and THREEPIO leave the homestead, waving to CLIEGG, OWEN and BERU as they go into the desert.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - SUNSET
ANAKIN sits down in the cockpit with PADME. THREEPIO is behind them. ARTOO is beside him. They are watching a hologram of MACE WINDU.

                    MACE WINDU
               We will deal with Count Dooku. The
               most important thing for you,
               Anakin, is to stay where you are.
               Protect the Senator at all costs.
               That is your priority.

                    ANAKIN
               Understood, Master.

The hologram switches off. PADME is looking at the readout on the ship's control panel.

                    PADME
               They'll never get there in time to
               save him. They have to come half
               way across the galaxy. Look,
               Geonosis is less than a parsec away.

PADME starts to hit buttons and flick switches. ANAKIN puts a hand over hers, stopping her. She stares at him.

                    ANAKIN
               If he's still alive.

                    PADME
               Annie, are you just going to sit
               here and let him die?? He's your
               friend... your mentor...

                    ANAKIN
               ...He's like my father, but you
               heard Master Windu. He gave me
               strict orders to stay here.

                    PADME
               He gave you strict orders to
               protect me...

PADME pulls her hand free and flicks more switches. The engines fire.

                    PADME
                    (continuing)
               ...and I'm going to save Obi-Wan.
               So if you plan to protect me, you
               will have to come along.

ANAKIN grins and takes the controls.

EXT. TATOOINE, BLUFF OVERLOOKING HOMESTEAD - SUNSET
The Naboo Starship rises from the bluff and zooms away.

EXT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE - DAY
TWO HUNDRED JEDI KNIGHTS are assembling outside the huge center of the Jedi Order.

INT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE, COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY
The JEDI COUNCIL are assembled as MACE WINDU makes his plea.

                    MACE WINDU
               The longer we wait, the stronger
               Dooku's armies become. We cannot
               wait for the Senate to make up its
               mind about granting the Chancellor
               emergency powers, in order to be
               able to use that clone army... We
               have the authority to go now. We
               must go now.

All of the JEDI COUNCIL nod their approval.

                    YODA
               Agreed, Master Windu. Two hundred
               Jedi send. Enough, let's hope
               they are.

INT. CORUSCANT, MAIN SENATE CHAMBER - DAY
Inside the great rotunda, the UPROAR is even louder. Opposing SENATOES yell furiously at one another.

                    MAS AMEDDA
               Order! Order!!

Finally, the uproar dies.

                    PALPATINE
               In the regrettable absence of
               Senator Amidala, the chair
               recognises Senior
               Representative of Naboo, Jar Jar
               Binks.

Amid the conflicting storm of CHEERS AND BOOS, JAR JAR, with TWO GUNGAN AIDES, floats on his pod to the middle of the vast space. He looks at PALPATINE nervously. PALPATINE nods. JAR JAR clears his throat.

                    JAR JAR
               Senators, dellow felagates...

Laughter. Jeers. JAR JAR blushes.

                    MAS AMEDDA
               Order! The Senate will accord the
               Representative the courtesy of a
               hearing!

Comparative quiet. JAR JAR grips the edge of the podium.

                    JAR JAR
               In response to the direct threat
               to the Republic from the
               Confederacy of Independent
               Systems, I propose that the Senate
               gives immediate emergency powers to
               the Supreme Chancellor.

Uproar. JAR JAR looks a little sheepish.

                    JAR JAR
                    (continuing)
               Who can deny these are exceptional
               times? Exceptional times demand
               exceptional measures!
               Exceptional measures demand
               exceptional men!

                    ORN FREE TAA
               We won't support a dictator.

SHOUTS of agreement.

                    JAR JAR
               That is the sentiment every one of
               us agrees with! And when the
               shadow of war has dispersed and
               the bright day of liberty has
               dawned once again, the power we now
               give to the Supreme Chancellor
               will be gladly, and swiftly
               returned. Out ancient liberties
               will be restored to us, burnished
               even more brightly than before!

Brief silence, then a rolling wave of APPLAUSE. JAR JAR beams and bows.

PALPATINE rises.

                    PALPATINE
               It is with great reluctance that
               I have agreed to this calling. I
               love democracy... I love the
               Republic. The fact that this
               crisis is demanding I be given
               absolute power to tule over you is
               evident. But I am mild by nature
               and have no desire to destroy
               the democratic process. The power you
               give me I will lay down when this
               crisis has abated, I promise you.
               And all I ask in return is when my
               current term of office is over,
               you allow me to reture and live
               out my life in peace.

                    MAS AMEDDA
               We shall proceed to the vote. All
               those in favor of granting
               emergency powers to the Supreme
               Chancellor, signal ate at this
               time... those opposed?

The Naboo Starship heads toward the rings of Geonosis.

EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA
The Naboo Starship lands.

INT. COCKPIT, NAOO STARFIGHTER - DAY
ANAKIN switches off the engines. ARTOO and THREEPIO are in the navigation area of the cockpit. PADME is in the co-pilot's seat. She gets up.

                    ANAKIN
               Hey, where are you going?

                    PADME
               To find Obi-Wan.

ANAKIN gets up and goes over to her.

                    ANAKIN
               No! You're not!

He grabs her arm.

                    PADME
               Let go of me!

                    ANAKIN
               I'm not letting you go out there.
               It's too dangerous.

                    PADMÉ
               What?!?

                    ANAKIN
               It's my job to protect you. I said
               it's too dangerous. You're not
               going, and that's final!

                    PADMÉ
               Don't you give me orders, Annie!
               I'm a Senator of the Galactic
               Republic. You have no authority
               to contain me, restrain me, or
               direct me! You remember your
               place, young man.
                    (standing up)
               Now you can come along and protect
               me or stay here. It's up to you.

PADME storms out of the cockpit of the Naboo Starfighter. ANAKIN stands scratching his head, then follows.

ARTOO BEEPS and WHISTLES.

                    C-3PO
               Yes, it is, Artoo. Most
               confusing. One moment they're
               generating a pleasant mutual
               attraction and the next, waves of
               violent hostility. Even though
               I'm programmed to understand them,
               I doubt if I ever shall.

ARTOO WHISTLES a plaintive sigh.

INT. GEONOSIS, CORRIDORS - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME enter the stalagmite city. They stop, looking around in wonder at the emptiness.

                    PADME
                    (in a low voice)
               It's empty!

They start forward. As they pass, the surface of the pillars seems to pulse slowly and move. High above WINGED CREATURES grow from the pillars and detach themselves.

INT. GEONOSIS, CENTRAL SQUARE - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME cross the square, reaching the middle. They stop suddenly as FOUR GEONOSIANS grabs them. ANAKIN reaches for his lightsaber.

                    PADME
               Wait!

TWENTY WINGED GEONOSIANS carrying weapons alight on the flagstones in front of them.

The GEONOSIANS part, and COUNT DOOKU appears. He bows courteously.

                    COUNT DOOKU
               Senator Amidala, I've heard so
               much about you.

                    PADMÉ
               Count Dooku, I assume.

                    COUNT DOOKU
               I'm delighted to meet you at
               last. We have a great deal to
               discuss, Senator. I hope you can
               keep your young Jedi under control.

                    PADMÉ
               Don't worry he's housebroken.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM (GEONOSIS) - DAY
COUNT DOOKU sits at a large conference table with PADME on the far 
side. ANAKIN stands behind her with FOUR GEONOSIANS GUARDS standing behind him. JANGO FETT stands behind COUNT DOOKU, and SIX GEONOSIAN GUARDS stand behind him.

                    PADMÉ
               You are holding a Jedi Knight, Obi-
               Wan Kenobi. I am formally
               requesting you turn him over to
               me, now.

                    DOOKU
               He has been convicted of
               espionage, Senator, and will be
               executed. In just a few hours, I
               believe.

COUNT DOOKU smiles.

                    PADMÉ
               He is an officer of the Republic.
               You can't do that.

                    DOOKU
               We don't recognise the Republic
               here, Senator. But if Naboo were
               to join our Alliance, I could
               easily hear your plea for clemency.

ANAKIN grabs his lightsaber but doesn't turn it on.

                    PADMÉ
               And if I don't join your
               rebellion, I assume this Jedi with
               me will also die?

                    DOOKU
               I don't wish to make you to join
               our cause against your will,
               Senator, but you are a rational,
               honest representative of your
               people and I assume you want to do
               what's in their best interest.
               Aren't you fed up with the
               corruption, the bureaucrats, the
               hypocrisy of it all?.. Aren't
               you? Be honest, Senator.

                    PADMÉ
               The ideals are still alive, Count,
               even if the institution is failing.

                    DOOKU
               You believe in the same ideals we
               believe in! The same ideals we
               are striving to make prominent.

                    PADMÉ
               If what you say is true, you
               should stay in the Republic and
               help Chancellor Palpatine put
               things right.

                    DOOKU
               The Chancellor means well, M'Lady
               but he is incompetent. He has
               promised to cut the bureaucracy,
               but the bureaucrats are stronger
               than ever, no? Senator, the
               Republic cannot be fixed. It is
               time to start over. The
               democratic process in the Republic
               is a sham, a shell game played
               on the voters. It will not be long
               before the cult of greed, called
               the Republic, will lose even the
               pretext of democracy and freedom.

                    PADMÉ
               I cannot believe that. I will not
               forsake all I have honoured and
               worked for and betray the
               Republic. I know of your treaties
               with the Trade Federation, the
               Commerce Guilds, and the others,
               Count. What is happening here is
               not government that has been
               bought out by business... it's
               business becoming government!

                    DOOKU
               Are you willing to betray your Jedi
               friends? Without your co-operation
               I can do nothing to stop their
               execution.

                    PADMÉ
               What is to happen to me? Am I to be
               executed also?

                    DOOKU
               I wouldn't think of such an
               offence. But, there are
               individuals who have a strong
               interest in your demise, M'lady.
               It has nothing to do with
               politics, I'm afraid. It's purely
               personal, and they have already
               paid great sums to have you
               assassinated. I'm sure they will
               push hard to have you included in
               the executions. I'm sorry but if
               you are not going to co-operate, I
               must turn you over to the
               Geonosians for justice. I've done
               all I can for you.

JANGO FETT moves over to ANAKIN.

                    JANGO FETT
               I'll take that weapon.

ANAKIN hesitates.

                    DOOKU 
               You may cause a lot of bloodshed,
               my young Jedi, but you will not
               escape.

                    PADMÉ
               Anakin...

ANAKIN hands his lightsaber over to JANGO FETT.

INT. GEONOSIS, HIGH AUDIENCE CHAMBER - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME are standing in the centre of what looks like a courtroom. Seated before them in a tall, boxed-off area is POGGLE THE LESSER, Archduke of Geonosis. He is accompanied by his underling, SUN RIT. Off to one side the Separatist Senators PO NUDU, TESSEK, and TOONBUCK TOORA. Next to them are the Commerce Dignitaries, SHU MAI, NUTE GUNRAY, PASSEL ARGENTE, WAT TAMBOR and SAN HILL of the Intergalactic Bank Clan. Along the wall about a HUNDRED GEONOSIANS wait for a verdict.

                    SUN RIT
               You have been charged and found
               guilty of Espionage.

                    POGGLE
               Do you have anything to say before
               your sentence is carried out?

                    PADMÉ
               You are committing an act of war,
               Archduke. I hope you are prepared
               for the consequences.

POGGLE laughs. COUNT DOOKU simply smiles.

                    POGGLE
               We build weapons, Senator... that
               is our business! Of course we're
               prepared!

                    NUTE GUNRAY
               Get on with it. Carry out the
               sentence. I want to see her suffer.

                    POGGLE
               Your other Jedi friend is waiting
               for you, Senator. Take them to
               the arena!

FOUR GUARDS take hold of PADME and ANAKIN. They are escorted out of the chamber to the sounds of chuckling.

INT. GEONOSIS TUNNEL TO EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
In the gloomy tunnel, ANAKIN and PADME are tossed into an open cart. The murmur of a vast crowd is heard offscreen. GUARDS extend their arms along the framework and tie them so that they stand facing each other.

The DRIVER gets up onto his seat.

                    ANAKIN
               Don't be afraid.

                    PADMÉ
               I'm not afraid to die. I've been
               dying a little bit each day since
               you came back into my life.

                    ANAKIN
               What are you talking about?

                    PADMÉ
               I love you.

                    ANAKIN
               You love me?! I thought we
               decided not to fall in love. That
               we would be forced to live a lie.
               That it would destroy our lives...

                    PADMÉ
               I think our lives are about to be
               destroyed anyway. My love for you
               is a puzzle, Annie, for which I
               have no answers. I can't control
               it... and now I don't care. I
               truly, deeply love you, and before
               we die I want you to know.

PADME leans toward ANAKIN. By straining hard, it is just possible for 
their lips to meet. They kiss.

                    ANAKIN
               I have no desire to be cured of
               this love either. Long or short,
               I vow to spend the rest of my life
               with you.

They kiss again.

The DRIVER cracks his whip over the ORRAY harnessed between the shafts. The cart jerks forward. Suddenly, there isa HUGE ROAR and blinding sunlight as they emerge into the arena

INT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
The great stadium is packed with tier upon tier of yelling GEONOSIANS. The cart trundles to the center, where OBI-WAN is chained to one of four upright posts thatare three feet in diameter. The cart stops. PADME and ANAKIN are taken down, dragged to posts, and chained to them. PADME is in the center.

                    OBI-WAN
               I was beginning to wonder if you
               had gotten my message.

                    ANAKIN
               I retransmitted it as you
               requested, Master. Then we decided
               to come and rescue you.

                    OBI-WAN
               It looks like you're going a good
               job so far.

Their arms are pulled high above their heads, and the cart drives away. There is another ROAR as POGGLE THE LESSER, COUNT DOOKU, NUTE GUNRAY, THE FETTS and DIGNITARIES arrive in the archducal box and take their places.

                    SUN RIT
               The felons before you have been
               convicted of espionage against the
               Sovereign System of Geonosis.
               Their sentence of death is to be
               carried out in this public arena
               henceforth.

The crowd ROARS and CHEERS. In the box, POGGLE THE LESSER rises. The crowd becomes quiet.

                    POGGLE
               Let the executions begin!

The crowd goes wild.

                    ANAKIN
               I have a bad feeling about this.

From different gates around the arena, THREE MONSTERS are driven in. One is a REEK (bull-like), one is a NEXU (lion-like), and one is an ACKLAY (a kind of dino-lobster). They are driven in by PICADORS carrying long spears and riding ORRAYS. The PICADORS poke the MONSTERS toward the center, then retire to the perimeter.

The MONSTERS toss their heads, looking around, ROARING or SCREECHING. Then they catch sight of the THREE CAPTIVES and start moving toward them.

                    OBI-WAN
               Take the one the left. I'll
               take the one on the right.

                    ANAKIN
               What about Padme?

PADME has turned around and is pulling herself up by the chain to the top of the post. Within a moment, she is standing on top of it, trying to pull the chain free.

                    OBI-WAN
               It looks like she's already on top
               of things.

The REEK charges ANAKIN. He jumps up, and the beast hits the post hard. ANAKIN lands onto its back, wrapping part of his chain around its horn. The REEK backs off, shaking its head angrily, which tears the chain from the post

OBI-WAN ducks around the post as the ACKLAY charges. It knocks the post flat, sending OBI-WAN sprawling. The ACKLAY crunches the post between its claws, freeing the chain. OBI-WAN leaps up and runs towards ONE of the PICADORS. The ACKLAY taks off after him.

The NEXU arrives at PADME'S post and rears on its hind legs. One top, PADME struggles to tear the chain free. The NEXU ROARS, displaying wicked, dripping fangs.

In the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY beams and rubs his hands.

In the arena, OBI-WAN runs at the PICADOR. The ORRAY rears up. OBI-WAN grabs the PICADOR'S long spear and pole vaults over him. The chasing ACKLAY smashes into the ORRAY. It goes down. The PICADOR tumbles onto the sand, where he is grabbed by the ACKLAY and crunched.

ANAKIN's REEK starts to buck. It charges around the arena with ANAKIN hanging on for dear life. He whirls the free length of chain around his head and casts it into the REEK's mouth. Its jaws clamp hard on the chain. ANAKIN yanks hard on the chain, turning the REEK, beginning to ride it.

The NEXU's claws dig deep into the post. The cat-like creature reaches the top of the post and takes a swipe at PADME. She turns and the claw barely catches her shirt ripping it off, leaving superficial claw marks across her back. She hits the creature with her chain and it backs off down the pole. Then, PADME jumps off the post into the air. She swings around on the chain and whacks the beast hard on the head with both her feet. It tumbles back onto the sand.

In the archducal box:

                    NUTE GUNRAY
               Foul!! She can't do that... shoot
               her or something!

In the arena, OBI-WAN runs out from behind the fallen ORRAY and throws the spear at the ACKLAY, hitting it in the neck. It lets out a terrible SCREECH and turns on him. The NEXU springs up and makes to leap up at PADME again. She finally manages to work the chain loose. ANAKIN comes charging up on the REEK.

                    ANAKIN
               You okay?

                    PADME
                    (nods, gasping)
               Sure! Well, sort of.

                    ANAKIN
               Jump!!!

The NEXU springs. PADME leaps from the top of the post to land on the REEK in front of ANAKIN. He hauls her upright. The REEK charges away, around the arena. The NEXU bounds after it. The REEK passes the wounded ACKLAY. The NEXU smells the blood and turns aside to attack the ACKLAY. The TWO MONSTERS fight. The crowd GROANS and BOOS.

In the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY turns angrily to COUNT DOOKU.

                    NUTE GUNRAY
               This isn't how it's supposed to
               be! Jango, finish her off.

COUNT DOOKU motions for the bounty hunter to ptay put. BOBA FETT is enjoying the spectacle.

                    COUNT DOOKU
                    (smiling enigmatically)
               Patiece, Viceroy... she will die.
               Maybe this is the way it's
               supposed to end.

OBI-WAN runs and jumps on the back of the REEK behind ANAKIN. Across the arena, the NEXU, having chewed up the ACKLAY, starts to advance toward them.

                    C-3PO
               Yes, it has been rather a long
               time. Do you suppose something's
               happened to them?

ARTOO BEEPS and WHISTLES.

                    C-3PO
                    (continuing)
               Danger? Oh no, I shouldn't think
               so. It looks a very dull planet
               to me. They should be back
               shortly. Just stop worrying, Artoo.

EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
In the archducal box, amid the uproar, COUNT DOOKU feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns to see MACE WINDU standing behind him. COUNT DOOKU masks his surprise elegantly as he surveys the arena and sees JEDI KNIGHTS standing at every entrance and exit.

                    COUNT DOOKU
               Master Windu, how pleasant of you
               to join us. You're just in time
               for the moment of truth. I would
               think these two new boys of yours
               could use a little more training.

                    MACE WINDU
               Sorry to disappoint you, Dooku.
               This party's over.

MACE WINDU signals, and at stategic places around the arena there are sudden flashes of light as about ONE HUNDRED JEDI switch on their lightsabers. The crowd is suddenly silent. COUNT DOOKU'S lips curl in slight amusement.

                    COUNT DOOKU
                    (to Mace Windu)
               Brave, but stupid, my old Jedi
               friend. You're impossibly
               outnumbered.

                    MACE WINDU
               I don't think so. One Jedi has to
               be worth a hundred Geonosians.

COUNT DOOKU looks around the great theater. His smile grows.

                    COUNT DOOKU
               It wasn't the Geonosians I was
               thinking about. How well do you
               think one Jedi will hold up
               against a thousand battle droids?

COUNT DOOKU signals. THOUSANDS OF DROIDS start to pour into all parts of the arena.

MACE WINDU draws his lightsaber, JANGO FETT draws his guns and fires at MACE WINDU, who deflects the shots. JANGO FETT and MACE WINDU jump into the arena, where they fight. BOBA FETT wacthes his Dad and the Jedi Master fight. The battle beginss. GEONOSIANS fly away everywhere. DROIDS fire at JEDI, who deflect the bolts and cult down the DROIDS. The GEONOSIAN TROOPS fire ray guns that are more difficult for the JEDI to deflect.

The REEK and the NEXU are spooked by the battle. The REEK bucks the riders off its back and stampedes around the arena, trampling DROIDS and JEDI that have moved into its path. PADME picks up a discarded pistol and joins the fight. SEVERAL JEDI run to the center of the arena and toss lightsabers to OBI-WAN and ANAKIN.

Among the crowd, JEDI cut down swaths of GEONOSIANS and DROIDS. On the sand, JEDI fight, attacking DROIDS. OBI0WAN and ANAKIN swing their lightsabers, cutting DROIDS in half. PADME blasts away at DROIDS and GEONOSIANS.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP
ARTOO whistles.

                    C-3PO
               I don't hear anything.
                    (Artoo beeps)
               You're scaring me! Stop imagining
               things!

EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
Among the tiers, JEDI are slowly being driven back. They have killed heaps of GEONOSIANS and have kncoked out piles of DROIDS, but sheer numbers are telling. Individual JEDI are being cut down or blasted/ The rest are retreating into the arena.

ANAKIN and PADME are back-to-back, fighting DROIDS and flying GEONOSIANS. MACE WINDU fights fiercely with JANGO FETT. Finally, the bounty hunter falls. His helmet goes flying, bouncing down the steps, tumbling and rolling, kicked here and there by random feet. The bounty hunter's body falls to the ground.

MACE WINDU runs to the center of the arena and fights back-to-back with OBI-WAN, as they swipe and mangle DROIDS.

                    OBI-WAN
               Someone's got to - shut down -
               these droids.

                    MACE WINDU
               Don't worry! It's being - taken
               care of!

EXT. GEONOSIS, FEDERATION STARSHIP - DAY
KI-ADI-MUNDI leads a raiding party of about TWENTY JEDI through the lines of parked Battle Starships. They cut a swath through masses of DROIDS until they arrive at the Command Starship. Some JEDI fall. The rest cut their way up the ramps and into the Command Ship.

INT. COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CORRIDORS - DAY
KI-ADI-MUNDI and teh surviving JEDI fight their way through the corridors of the Command Ship, deflecting laser bolts, slicing DROIDS.

INT. COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CONTROL BRIDGE - DAY
THEY burst onto the bridge and chop down the COMMAND DROIDS. The NEIMOIDIANS flee in all directions. KE-ADI-MUNDI leans over the control panel. He locates the illuminated master switch and punches down on it. It goes dark. Instantly, all the DROIDS on the Starship and all the DROIDS in the arena FREEZE!

There is a moment of stunned silence, then the JEDI CHEER. One the bridge, PLO KOON claps KI-ADI-MUNDI on the back.

                    PLO KOON
               We've done it! Now we have a
               chance!

Suddenly, there is a harsh BEEPING SOUND. All the DROIDS on the Starship and all the DROIDS in the arena start fighting again! KI-ADI-MUNDI stares in disbelief and dismay.

                    KI-ADI-MUNDI
               The system's off but they're still
               active. That's a new feature. They
               are independent of the control
               system.

EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
MACE WINDU, OBI-WAN, ANAKIN, PADME and an exhausted group of about TWENTY JEDI stand in the center of the arena surrounded by a ring of BATTLE DROIDS. The bloodied sand around them is strewn with the bodies of DEAD GEONOSIANS, SHATTERED DROIDS and JEDI.

At the foot of some steps, BOBA FETT finds his father's battered helmet. He picks it up.

KI-ADI-MUNDI and the SURVIVORS from the raiding party are herded into the arena by SUPERDROIDS. From the encircling tiers above, THOUSANDS OF BATTLE DROIDS level their weapons menacingly.

In the archducal box, COUNT DOOKU lifts his hand. The DROIDS lower their weapons. The COUNT calls out to the JEDI.

                    COUNT DOOKU
               Master Windu!

Silence.

                    COUNT DOOKU
                    (continuing)
               You have fought gallantly. Worthy
               of recognition in the history
               archives of the Jedi Order. Now
               it is finished.
                    (pauses briefly)
               Surrender - and your lives will be 
               spared.

                    MACE WINDU
               We will not be hostages for you to
               barter with Dooku.

                    COUNT DOOKU
               Then, I'm sorry, old friend. You
               will have to be destroyed.

The DROIDS raise their weapons. ANAKIN and PADME clasps hands tightly. COUNT DOOKU raises his hand to give the order to fire. PADME looks up suddenlt and whispers to ANAKIN.

                    PADME
               Look!

Above, six Gunships are descending fast through the open area in the arena ceiling. They land in a cluster around the handful of JEDI. CLONE TROOPERS spill out and start firing at the DROIDS. There is a hellstorm of laserfire that bounces off the laser shields created by the Gunships. YODA appears at the door of one of the Gunships.

                    YODA
               Come on - hurry! Hurry!

The SURVIVING JEDI dash to the Gunships and scramble in. MACE WINDU hangs on tight as the Gunship, firing all its weapons, rises out of the arena up and over the topmost rim.

EXT. GEONOSIS, TERRAIN OUTSIDE EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
The massed lines of parked Federation Starships and the DROIDS surrounding the arena, are themselves surrounded by thousands of Republic Starships, disgorging TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPERS. Beyond, more Republic Starships are landing and spewing out troops.

INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER ONE - DAY
MACE WINDU stares at the incredible sight.

                    YODA
               More battalions to the left.
               Encircle them we must, then
               divide.

The CLONE TROOPERS open fire with artillery. EXPLOSIONS wreck the parked Battle Starships. CLONE TROOPERS advance, firing at the massed DROIDS. FIGHTER DROIDS fly overhead, exchanging fire with the Gunships and JEDI fighters.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - DAY
THREEPIO and ARTOO see flashes outside of the ship, exploding everywhere.

                    C-3PO
               I'm sure I heard something, this
               time. Didn't you? It's probably
               just a celebration

ARTOO lets out an EXHAUSTED BLEEP.

EXT. BATTLEFIELD, GEONOSIS LANDSCAPE - DAY
Gunship #2 skims the battlefield, firing down, deflecting answering fire from the droids.

INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER TWO - DAY
OBI-WAN, ANAKIN and PADME are at the open sides of the Gunship. CLONES fire down at the DROIDS below.

The Gunship slows, circling over a droid gun-emplacement. It blasts it, but suddenly the Gunship is rocked by a near miss. It lurches violently.

                    OBI-WAN
               Hold on! Look over there...

Through the other side of the Gunship, they see a Geonosian Speeder racing past. In the open cockpit is the unmistakable figure of COUNT DOOKU.

                    ANAKIN
               It's Dooku, go after him!

The PILOT starts to comply, but... there is a HUGE BLASTS, the ship lurches on its side, and PADME tumbles out.

                    ANAKIN
                    (continuing)
               Padme!!!

ANAKIN stares down in horror as PADME hits thr ground below.

                    ANAKIN
                    (continuing; to pilot)
               Put the ship down! Down!

                    OBI-WAN
               No! Forget her. We have to go
               after Dooku.

                    ANAKIN
               No we're not!! Land this ship!

                    OBI-WAN
               Don't let your personal feelings
               get in the way. We've got a job to
               do.

Below, PADME hauls herself to her feet and waves for them to go after DOOKU.

                    ANAKIN
               I don't care!.. Go back.

                    OBI-WAN
               Anakin! She's all right! Look.

ANAKIN stares out to see PADME rescued by CLONE TROOPERS.

                    OBI-WAN
                    (continuing)
               Follow that speeder!

On the ground, PADME looks up at Gunship #2 as it speeds away after Count Dooku. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN follow the speeder to a Geonosian tower. The speeder decsends rapidly; the Gunship follows.

Count Dooku's speeder parks outside the tower; the Gunship parks next to it. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN leap down and run inside the tower.

INT. GEONOSIS, SECRET HANGER TOWER - LATE DAY
COUNT DOOKU throws switches on a control panel. His Interstellar Sail Ship is guarded by a SQUAD OF SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The doors of the exit-port slide open.

                    DROID CAPTAIN
               Your Excellency!

COUNT DOOKU turns as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN run in through the hanger doors. They draw their lightsabers. The DROIDS raise their weapons.

                    COUNT DOOKU
               That won't be necessary, Captain.
               Stand down. And leave them to me.

The DROIDS lower their weapons and back off to the walls. COUNT DOOKU looks at OBI-WAN and ANAKIN with slight amusement.

                    OBI-WAN
                    (to Anakin)
               We move in together - you slowly
               on the...

                    ANAKIN
               I'm taking him now!

                    OBI-WAN
               Anakin, no!

                    ANAKIN
               You'll pay for all the Jedi you've
               killed today, Dooku.

ANAKIN charges across the open space at COUNT DOOKU, who smiles faintly, watching him come. ANAKIN raises his lightsaber. At the last moment, COUNT DOOKU thrusts out an arm, and ANAKIN is lifted up, hurled across the room, and slammed into the opposite wall. He slumps to the foot of the wall, semi-conscious. COUNT DOOKU moves toward OBI-WAN

                    COUNT DOOKU
               Kenobi, isn't it? As you can see,
               my Jedi powers are far beyond
               yours. Now, back down.

                    OBI-WAN
               I don't think so.

OBI-WAN lifts his lightsaber. COUNT DOOKU smiles.

                    COUNT DOOKU
               Ah, but if I must.

COUNT DOOKU draws his lightsaber. He and OBI-WAN start to circle each other.

                    COUNT DOOKU
                    (continuing)
               I have spent the last ten years
               learning to use the power of the
               Dark Side. It gives me infinitely
               greater power.

                    OBI-WAN
               You will have to prove it.

OBI-WAN comes in fast, swinging at COUNT DOOKU'S head. DOOKU parries the cut easily. As they fight, it quickly becomes clear that DOOKU is the complete swordsman - elegant, graceful, classical - a master of the old style.

                    COUNT DOOKU
               Grand Master Kenobi, you
               disappoint me. Yoda holds you in
               such high esteem.

COUNT DOOKU parried another cut.

                    COUNT DOOKU
                    (continuing)
               Surely you can do better...?
                    (parries)
               No, I'm surprised. Has Jedi
               swordsmanship degenerated so
               quickly, or are you trying to make
               fun of me?
                    (cuts)
               Which is it?

COUNT DOOKU thrusts. OBI-WAN steps back quickly, panting for breath.

                    COUNT DOOKU
                    (continuing)
               come, come, Master Kenobi. Put me
               out of my misery.

OBI-WAN takes a deep breath, gets a fresh grip on his lightsaber and comes in again. For a moment, he drives COUNT DOOKU back. Then Dooku's superior skill begins to tell again, and he forces OBI-WAN to retreat.

COUNT DOOKU increases the tempo of his attack. OBI-WAN is pushed to the limit to defend himself. DOOKU presses. His lightsaber flashes.

OBI-WAN is wounded in the shoulder, then the thigh. He stumbles back against the wall, trips, and falls. His lightsaber goes skittering across the floor.

COUNT DOOKU raises his lightsaber. OBI-WAN looks up helplessly. Dooku's lightsaber flashes down and CLASHES against - Anakin's lightsaber! COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN stare eyeball to eyeball.

                    COUNT DOOKU
                    (continuing)
               That's brave of you, boy - but
               foolish. I would have thought
               you'd have learnt your lesson.

                    ANAKIN
               I'm a slow learner.

And ANAKIN charges at COUNT DOOKU. The force of his attack catches the Count slightly off balance. Anakin's lightsaber flashes. COUNT DOOKU draws back, putting a hand to his arm. He takes the hand away and looks at the smear of blood whee Anakin has nicked him.

                    COUNT DOOKU
               You have unusual powers, young
               Padawan. But not enought to save
               you this time.

                    ANAKIN
               Don't bet on it!

                    OBI-WAN
               Anakin!

OBI-WAN uses the Force to catch his lightsaber and he tosses it to ANAKIN. With TWO LIGHTSABERS, ANAKIN attacks. COUNT DOOKU parries and ripostes. It is no contest. ANAKIN is driven back against the wall. He loses one lightsaber. Finally COUNT DOOKU, in one flashing move, sends Anakin's arm, cut at the elbow, flying still gripping his lightsaber. ANAKIN drops to the ground in agony. COUNT DOOKU draws himself up to deliver the coup de grace.

Suddenly, the great doors slide open. The DROIDS turn fast, raising their weapons. Through the thick smoke, emerges the heroic figure of YODA. He stops on the smoke-filled threashold, FOUR DROIDS lined up on either side of him, guns pointed.

Before the DROIDS can get off a shot, YODA raises his hand, and the DROIDS are flung against the far walls and crash to the floor in heaps of smoking metal.

Silence. COUNT DOOKU steps away from ANAKIN to face the Jedi Grand Master. His lightsaber whirls in a formal salute.

                    COUNT DOOKU
               Master Yoda. At last we shall
               know who is the most powerful.

YODA draws a miniature lightsaber out of his cane. He salutes formally.

                    YODA
               Count Dooku. No interest in
               contests, do I have.

COUNT DOOKU charges across the space at YODA. He rains down blows upon the tiny figure. YODA doesn't budge an inch. For the first part of the contest, he parries every cut and thrust that Dooku aims. Nothing the great swordsman tries gets through. His energy drains. His strokes become feebler, slower.

YODA attacks! He flies forward. COUNT DOOKU is forced to retreat. Wprds are insufficient to describe the range and skill of Yoda's speed and swordplay. His lightsaber his a humming blur of light.

Count Dooku's lightsaber is sent cartwheeling from his hand. He staggers back, gasping and spent, against the control panel. YODA jumps onto DOOKU'S shoulders, and is about to drive the lightsaber into the top of the Count's head.

                    YODA
                    (continuing)
               The end for you, Count, this is.

                    COUNT DOOKU
               ...Not yet...

COUNT DOOKU raises his arms and knocks YODA off his shoulders and then, with all his might, he uses the Force to pull on one of the cranes in the hanger. It comes crashing down on OBI-WAN and ANAKIN. But in the blink of and eye, YODA is under the crane, holding it up, using the Force. YODA closes his eyes and concentrates.

ANAKIN is unconscious, and OBI0WAN tries toget out from under the crane. The fallen crane trembles and starts to life. Behind it, the sound of the Sail Ship's engines are heard starting up.

YODA concentrates harder. Slowly, the crane rises. The SOUND OF THE ENGINES increases. YODA exerts every scrap of his powers. The crane lifts clear of ANAKIN and is thrown to the ground. DOOKU'S Sail Ship takes off. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN struggle to the exhausted YODA, but it's too late. The Sail Ship rises into the air and flies away. PADMÉ and a CLONE CAPTAIN with about TEN TROOPERS appear in the doorway.

                    PADMÉ
               Anakin!

PADMÉ runs too him and throws her arms around him. ANAKIN is barely able to stand up. The CLONE CAPTAIN marches up to YODA, stops, and salutes smartly.

                    CLONE CAPTAIN
               Resistance is at an end, General.
               What are your orders ?

YODA looks at him and sighs.

EXT. CORUSCANT, OLD TOWN - DAWN
COUNT DOOKU'S Interstellar Sail Ship glides through a deserted, burned-out part of Coruscant. COUNT DOOKU manoeuvres the ship into one of the empty buildings and lands.

INT. CORUSCANT, SECRET LANDING PLATFORM - DAWN
The ramp lowers. COUNT DOOKU emerges and walks to where the hooded figure of DARTH SIDIOUS stands waiting. COUNT DOOKU bows.

                    COUNT DOOKU
               The Force is with us, my Master.

                    DARTH SIDIOUS
               Welcome home, Lord Tyranus. You have
               done well.

                    COUNT DOOKU
               I bring you good news, my Lord.
               The war has begun.

                    DARTH SIDIOUS
               Excellent. 
                     (smiling)
               Everything is going as planned.

EXT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE - SUNSET
The beautiful temple basks in the red glow of the setting sun.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, COUNCIL CHAMBER - SUNSET

                    MACE WINDU
               Where is your apprentice?

                    OBI-WAN
               On his way back to Naboo. He is
               escorting Senator Amidala home.

They are standing, looking out through the tall windows at the great plaza below. YODA sits in his chair.

                    OBI-WAN
                    (continuing)
               I must admit without the clones,
               it would not have been a victory.

                    YODA
               Victory? Victory, you say?

OBI-WAN turns and looks at the sad little Jedi sitting in the Council Chamber. Apart from KI-ADI-MUNDI and PLO KOON, who is wounded, the Chamber is empty.

                    YODA
                    (continuing)
               Not victory, a defeat, it was...
               Master Obi-Wan. Begun, the Clone
               War has!

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN - LATE DAY
In a rose-covered arbor overlooking the sparkling late, ANAKIN and PADME stand before a NABOO HOLY MAN.

THREEPIO and ARTOO stand by, watching, as the HOLY MAN blesses the happy couple and, amid gently falling rose petals, ANAKIN and PADME kiss.

EXT. CORUSCANT, MILITARY STAGING AREA, BALCONY - LATE DAY
PALPATINE, JAR JAR, BAIL ORGANA and the OTHER SENATORS, with TWO ROYAL GUARDS, stand looking down at the square below.

TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPS are drawn up in a strict formation or move forwards in near files to climb the ramps of the Military Assault Ships.

On the balcony, PALPATINE'S expression is deeply sad. Everyone watches comberly as, in the square, loaded Assault Ships take off. Other land immediately in their place. The sky above is thick with transports. CLONE TROOPS march and board the Ships.

The Great Clone War has begun...

FADE OUT:
