               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - BACK GARDEN - SEPTEMBER 1939 - DAY

               COLOUR

               Raking down a line of suburban gardens lit by a late-summer 
               sun. Heads move back and forth above the fences that divide 
               the narrow strips of land, moving to the sound of unseen 
               lawn mowers.

               In one of these gardens two children, BILL (aged eight) 
               and his sister SUE (aged six) disport themselves. They are 
               sprawled out on the lawn, heads and hands intent on 
               something hidden from view in the lush vegetation of a 
               rockery garden. Beneath those flowers and plants is a dark 
               and mysterious forest, shaded by huge leaves, and broken 
               up by towering boulders. Mounted figures of medieval knights 
               ride in, guided by BILL'S gigantic hand. A wizard appears 
               in the path of the riders who draw up sharply. BILL gives 
               an impression of neighing horses. SUE'S face looms up 
               between large leaves. She makes the sound of spooky wind.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DINING/LIVING ROOM - DAY

               In the penumbra of the room, the mother, GRACE, in droopy 
               flowered frock, crosses, floats towards the walnut wireless 
               and, with trembling hand, switches it on. Its green dial 
               glows with stations like Droitwich and Hilversum. She glides 
               back and drapes herself behind an armchair in which her 
               husband, CLIVE, sits solemn and motionless.

               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY

               The sound of the lawn-mower ceases abruptly. BILL looks up 
               sharply. The neighbours' heads come to rest on top of the 
               garden fences. They turn, listening. BILL inclines his 
               head towards the french windows, sensing the dread moment. 
               He walks towards the door and is framed there. He regards 
               his parents.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DINING/LIVING ROOM - DAY

               They look back with unseeing, inward-turned eyes. Young 
               BILL gathers confused fragments of the fateful announcement.

                                     CHAMBERLAIN (V.O.)
                         ...those assurances... by eleven 
                         o'clock... a state of war... that 
                         this country... at war with Germany.

               The boy catches his mother's eye. She smiles en embarrassed 
               smile. The boy is embarrassed by her embarrassment. His 
               father's glassy solemnity angers him. In the garden, SUE 
               sings.

                                     SUE (O.S.)
                              (singing)
                         Flat foot floogie with a Floy Floy.

               BILL turns to his sister.

                                     BILL
                         Stop that, Sue!

               CLIVE is startled out of his funereal reverie.

                                     BILL
                         She just sings it. She doesn't 
                         know what it means.

               An older sister, DAWN, a tumescent fifteen, stumbles into 
               the room in a nightdress.

                                     DAWN
                         Where are my stockings? I can't 
                         find my stockings!

               Her mother, GRACE, interrupts her with outstretched arms.

                                     GRACE
                         Dawn, darling. They've started a 
                         war again.

               GRACE says it as though announcing that dinner is served, 
               but her voice is torn by a sob as she holds DAWN in her 
               arms.

                                     GRACE
                              (whispering and 
                              sobbing)
                         We mustn't frighten the little 
                         ones.

               DAWN is appalled by her mother's display of sentiment. She 
               wrenches free.

                                     DAWN
                         I don't care! I want my stockings!

               CLIVE get's up, blazing. He seizes DAWN and shakes her.

                                     CLIVE
                         Stockings? War! Don't you 
                         understand! War!

                                     DAWN
                         I don't care!

                                     CLIVE
                         War! War!

               GRACE inserts herself between them.

                                     GRACE
                         Clive. Don't. Dawn, please.

               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY

               BILL calls out from the garden. He is jumping up and down, 
               pointing at the sky.

                                     BILL
                         German planes! German planes!

               They run out. GRACE sweeps little SUE into her arms, buring 
               her face in her bosom and rushing back into the shelter of 
               the house. DAWN and CLIVE scan the sky for planes, There 
               are none.

                                     BILL
                         I did see them. I did.

                                     DAWN
                         He's the worst liar.

               DAWN swings a fist at BILL and chases him into the room, 
               raining savage blows upon him.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DINING/LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Father is white with rage. He seizes them, one in each 
               hand. Mother cowers with SUE.

                                     CLIVE
                         These are the fruits of my loins?

               DAWN lunges at BILL. The GRANDMOTHER enters, tall, frail, 
               elegant, ga-ga, deaf.

                                     GRANDMA
                         Is it peace in out time?

                                     GRACE
                              (shouting)
                         No, Mother! It's War! War!

                                     GRANDMA
                         Or what?

                                     GRACE:
                         War! War! War!

               The wireless begins to play 'God Save the King'. Father 
               immediately lets go of the children and stands rigidly to 
               attention.  The others simmer down and shuffle into stiff 
               and still poses. GRANDMOTHER, who perhaps cannot hear the 
               Anthem, is baffled, shakes her head.

               EXT. ROSEHILL AVENUE - DAY

               The sirens sound. A shocking blast of noises, the sickening 
               ululations of the air-raid warning. They call out over the 
               rows of bow-fronted semidetached, lower-middle-class houses. 
               Some of the occupants, more daring or more confused than 
               their neighbours, burst out of their front doors, turning 
               in frenzied circles, craning at the heavens.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DAY

               The rigid family once more jerks into movement at the sound 
               of the siren, looking forcefully out of the french windows, 
               hiding under the table, clutching each other. The siren 
               stops. They wait, anxiously. Silence. Even the birds stopped 
               singing at the wailing of the first siren. This was perhaps 
               the worst moment of the war, the first moment, when war 
               was still an unknown dread thing. The siren again, but 
               this time, a long sustained note.

                                     CLIVE
                         That's the all-clear. Testing.  
                         They were just testing.

               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY

               CLIVE walks tentatively into the garden, looking up, 
               shielding his eyes against the sun. The others join Him, 
               one by one.

                                     GRACE
                         Such a beautiful day too.

               All search the clear blue sky. The sound of the lawn-mower 
               starts up again where it left off before the war.

                                     SUE
                              (singing)
                         Flat Foot Floogie with a Floy Floy.

               INT. CINEMA - DAY

               BLACK AND WHITE

               A Ministry of Information film advises and demonstrates 
               how to glue strips of paper to windows to avoid flying 
               glass, and how to construct an air-raid shelter. On the 
               soundtrack, in addition to the patronizing commentary voice, 
               is the sound of hundreds of screaming children.

               BILL and SUE sit among the children's matinee audience. 
               The children pay no attention to the screen, but fight and 
               shout, throw things at each other, jump over seats, cry, 
               wander up and down the aisles.

               The soundtrack changes to dramatic music and a 
               transformation takes place. All movement and talking ceases. 
               Hundreds of rapt faces stare at the screen where Hopalong 
               Cassidy rides into action.

               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY

                                     COLOUR
                         CLIVE has put an Anderson shelter 
                         at the end of the small garden, He 
                         is shovelling earth on to its humped 
                         corrugated metal roof. His friend, 
                         MAC, is watching him.

                                     CLIVE
                         Going to put a rockery garden over 
                         it, Mac.

               BILL's voice echoes from inside the shelter.

                                     BILL (O.S.)
                         Dad. It's full of water again.

               CLIVE and MAC peer in to see the boy splashing up and down, 
               water over his ankles. He clutches his submerged foot in 
               mock agony.

                                     BILL
                         Crocodiles! Aah!

                                     CLIVE
                         The sodding water table.

                                     MAC
                         Could you seal it over with hot 
                         pitch, Clive? Caulk it like the 
                         hull of a ship.

                                     CLIVE
                              (caustic)
                         Thanks. I hope you can come for 
                         the launching.

               INT/EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - KITCHEN/GARDEN - DAY

               The windows are criss-crossed with brown paper. Beyond, in 
               the garden, MAC has taken off his jacket and is shovelling 
               earth onto the shelter. BILL walks barefoot towards the 
               house, carrying his wet socks and shoes in his hands.

                                     MOLLY
                         It's not fair on them. It's selfish 
                         to keep them with you.

                                     GRACE
                         My aunt in Australia has offered..

               BILL sits on the steps at the half-open kitchen door and 
               wrings the water from his socks. SUE comes in and GRACE 
               signals MOLLY to be circumspect, but she blunders on.

                                     MOLLY
                         Snap it up. Great chance for them. 
                         Lot more future out there.

               BILL listens, talking it all in. GRACE Watches little SUE 
               waddle out carrying planes.

                                     GRACE
                         It's so far way. I couldn't bear 
                         it.

                                     MOLLY
                         Kids don't care. You're thinking 
                         of yourself.

               GRACE turns away. Fighting back tears. MOLLY impulsively 
               takes GRACE in her arms.

                                     MOLLY
                         I didn't mean it like that, Grace. 
                         Why does it always come out wrong?

                                     GRACE
                         I know you mean well.

               MOLLY laughs and holds her at arms length.

                                     MOLLY
                         There you go again. You're so bloody 
                         nice. I want to shake you.

               She does, mock serious.

                                     GRACE
                         Nothing will ever be the same again, 
                         Molly. And the funny thing is, I'm 
                         glad.

               MOLLY looks at her, surprised.

                                     MOLLY
                         Now you're talking.

               SUE listening to this, sees BILL on the steps and gives 
               him a questioning look. He shrugs, trying to conceal his 
               anxiety from his sister.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DAWN'S BEDROOM - DAY

               DAWN lies in bed, head buried in pillows in that deepest 
               of all sleep, the Sunday morning adolescent lie-in. BILL 
               shakes her, jumps on top of her, imitates an air-raid 
               warning, tries to pull off the bedclothes but she holds 
               them tight.

                                     BILL
                         There's a soldier at he door, 
                         looking for you.

               She whips back the sheet, wide awake. One look at his face 
               is enough to see that he is lying.

                                     DAWN
                         You're the biggest fibber.

                                     BILL
                         It's dinner time. It really is.  
                         Cross my heart.

               She snakes out an arm and pulls him into bed. She rolls on 
               top of him, tickling him and smothering him with kisses.

                                     DAWN
                         If there's no soldier, I'll have 
                         you instead.

               He giggles and struggles, gets into a panic, but she is 
               merciless, won't stop. Finally he starts to cry. She leaps 
               out of bed, disgusted with him.

                                     DAWN
                         Cry baby Bunting.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - GRACE'S BEDROOM - DAY

               CLIVE rummages in the wardrobe, chuckling to himself. He 
               finds his Sam Browne belt and Army cap from the First Wold 
               War.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               MOLLY and GRACE and GRANDMA have 'gin and its', the men 
               brown ale. They are in high spirits. SUE is doing a puzzle 
               on the floor. MOLLY shouts into GRANDMA'S ear.

                                     MOLLY
                         Few bombs might wake up this 
                         country.

               GRACE fills MAC'S glass in a tender gesture. A look passes 
               between them. MOLLY is a friend and wife, they love and 
               suffer in common. DAWN appears, wearing a defiant slash of 
               lipstick.

                                     GRACE
                         I doubt if a few bombs would wake 
                         up Dawn on a Sunday morning.

                                     DAWN
                         This phoney war get's on my nerves. 
                         If we're going to have a war, I 
                         wish they'd get it started.

                                     GRACE
                         Just ignore her, Mac.

               CLIVE appears having stripped to the waist but wearing his 
               Sam Browne from the First Wold War. They all shriek with 
               laughter. CLIVE, encouraged by this response, does drill 
               movements and then demonstrates how to salute.

                                     CLIVE
                         There are many ways of saluting..
                              (he demonstrates.)
                         ..An old soldier insulting a young 
                         subaltern.

               His hand flies to his forehead, gouging the air, the salute 
               transformed into an obscene gesture. More laughter.

                                     CLIVE
                         As an officer, you counter that 
                         with one of these.

               He raises his arm slowly and languidly until his limp hand 
               just brushes his temple. A faraway look in his eyes disdains 
               any acknowledgement of the insulting salute. A tiny skirmish 
               in the class war.

               BILL and SUE swing on the leather straps of the Sam Browne.  
               They want him to stop. They sense something dangerous, 
               alien, their father in an unfamiliar role, another person.

               The wireless has been on all this time, playing music and 
               now come the chimes of Big Ben. It is news time. The adults 
               are suddenly stock-still and serious, leaving the children 
               stranded in an excited state..

                                     NEWSREADER (V.O.)
                         Here is the news and this is Alvar 
                         Lidell reading it.

               The children are told to be quiet. The room becomes a frieze 
               of portentous concentration.

               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY

               BILL slips into the garden, looks up at the leaden sky 
               imploringly.

                                     BILL
                         Come on. Come on.

               The news bulletin filters out into the garden. Norway has 
               fallen, perhaps, or Churchill become Prime Minister.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

               The meal has been eaten. They are animated again, but more 
               reflective, DAWN is winding wool with GRANDMA. BILL and 
               SUE have also left the table. BILL is looking at the Sam 
               Browne, now slung over the armchair, with its tangy smell 
               of deep polish like shiny milk chocolate, a mysterious 
               icon of war. The conversation at the table drifts over to 
               him.

                                     MAC
                         ...It was a toss-up. His company 
                         went to India, mine went to France. 
                         Flip of a coin.

                                     CLIVE
                         ...two Indians to fan me all night. 
                         The heat.

                                     MAC
                         ....buried In a shell-hole for 
                         thee days, while he's out there 
                         playing polo and sticking pigs.

                                     GRACE
                         It was the best time of his life.

                                     MAC
                         How many of our class left? You 
                         and me out of twenty-eight.

                                     CLIVE
                         And Jim.

                                     MAC
                         What's left of him. He'll never 
                         see outside of the Star and Garter.

               BILL sinks his teeth into Same Browne. He bites hard and 
               is pleased to see that his teeth marks go quite deep into 
               the leather.

                                     CLIVE
                         I rode into battle...

               DAWN, winding wool, knows this speech by heart and mimes 
               it silently with her father.

                                     CLIVE
                         ...On horseback, with a drawn sword, 
                         leading a battalion of Gurkhas 
                         against the Turks.

               GRANDMA watches DAWN'S moving lips and strains to hear.

                                     GRANDMA
                         I can't hear you.

                                     MOLLY
                         And where were the Turks?

               She also knows the story.

                                     GRACE
                         No Turks.

                                     CLIVE
                         We didn't know that. It was a 
                         suicide mission. Machetes against 
                         artillery. Volunteers only.

                                     GRACE
                         They'd gone.

                                     MOLLY
                         Saw Clive coming.

               They all have a good laugh at CLIVE'S expense and he takes 
               it well enough. BILL drifts over to his lead soldiers spread 
               out in a corner of the room. They are an eclectic mix of 
               cowboys, Indians, the Medieval Knights, as well as modern 
               militia and a few farm animals.

                                     CLIVE
                         We all had to write a last letter 
                         home.

                                     GRACE
                         And it was the last. Hasn't written 
                         a letter since. Not even a birthday 
                         card.

               BILL sets a mounted knight against a clutch of modern 
               infantry.

                                     MAC
                         It's not like when you're in it.  
                         Just young boys spilling their 
                         guts in the mud.

                                     DAWN
                         What were they like, the Germans, 
                         when you were a prisoner of war?

               BILL looks up with interest. The others fall silent.

                                     MAC
                         Most of them were very decent to 
                         me.

                                     MOLLY
                         I wish you wouldn't go saying that. 
                         You'll get into trouble.

                                     DAWN
                         You can speak German, can't you?

                                     MAC
                         A bit.

                                     DAWN
                         Say something. I want to know what 
                         it sounds like.

                                     MOLLY
                         Certainly not!

                                     MAC
                         In den ganzen Welt die meisten 
                         Leute sind dumm.

                                     MOLLY
                         Not so loud!

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

               Later. The two men are in post-prandial sleep in the 
               armchairs on either side of the fire. Sounds of washing up 
               and women's voices come from the kitchen. BILL walks up 
               very close and examines the two warriors from the Great 
               War, or the First World War, as it was now coming to be 
               known. Their mouths are open, slack. His father's false 
               teeth click up and down as he breathes. MAC shifts his 
               backside in his sleep to let a fart up from the side of 
               the leatherette armchair. BILL looks at CLIVE's mottled 
               skin, the stubble, the sagging epidermis around the eyes. 
               He goes to the mantelpiece and takes down a silver-framed 
               picture of his father as a baby-faced second lieutenant 
               wearing that same Sam Browne. BILL holds the picture next 
               to his father's snoring face. Once again, a new bulletin 
               begins on the ever-playing wireless.

                                     BILL
                         Dad, the News. It's the News.

               CLIVE stirs.

                                     CLIVE
                         Go off and play, son.

               BILL shakes him.

                                     BILL
                         But Dad, It's the News.

                                     CLIVE
                         Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm 
                         not sleeping, just closing my eyes.

               BILL is confused. He still feels it is his duty to wake 
               him.

                                     BILL
                              (shouting)
                         The Germans! They've landed!

               GRACE and MOLLY appear at the door, alarmed. The men sleep 
               on.

                                     BILL
                         Only joking.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               BILL and SUE are in two beds, side by side. Between them 
               is a crystal set and they are sharing the earphones 
               listening to Itma or Much Binding in the Marsh. Their door 
               is half open and a gust of shots and cries rises from below. 
               BILL gets up and goes to the door.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - HALLYWAY AND LANDING - NIGHT

               BILL and SUE venture out on to the landing and peer through 
               the banisters to the hallway and front door below.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

               MAC and MOLLY are leaving, as CLIVE and GRACE help them on 
               with their coats. They have had a few more drinks, and are 
               making sentimental farewells.

                                     MOLLY
                         Bloody gin. Always makes me cry.

                                     MAC
                         Got some wires crossed. Only weeps 
                         when she's happy.

                                     GRACE
                         You're making me start now.

               MAC embarrasses her.

                                     MAC
                         Now, now Grace.

               He turns to CLIVE and takes him by the shoulders. They are 
               both quiet drunk.

                                     MAC
                         Root it out Clive... the thought 
                         of it, before it takes hold.

                                     CLIVE
                         Weeds will grow, Mac.

                                     MAC
                         Consider Grace, the kids. I love 
                         them like my own. And you.

                                     CLIVE
                         Kiss me Hardy.

               As he mentions the children Molly wails anew.

                                     MOLLY
                         Why couldn't I have the kids? Is 
                         he sitting up there... saying... 
                         "Grace, yes; Molly, no?"

               GRACE holds her tight.

                                     GRACE
                         Better off, Molly. What's to become 
                         of the poor mites!

               SUE'S face creases and tears well up. BILL puts a protective 
               arm about her.

                                     MAC
                         You're a mug, Clive. We did our 
                         bit in the Last Lot.

                                     CLIVE
                         If King and Country call, Mac, you 
                         go as soon as I will.

               MAC'S face goes white with anger.

                                     MAC
                         What did we know? We were seventeen.

                                     CLIVE
                              (with a far-off 
                              look)
                         I heard the drum and fife yesterday, 
                         Mac, marching past.  Made my hair 
                         stand on end.  I thought, I've 
                         been asleep for twenty years.

               MAC wants to hit him. He turns away, trembling.

                                     MAC
                         Go the Hell.

               He puts an arm about MOLLY and plunges into the blacked-
               out dark-winter-night. As GRACE turns back, she glimpses 
               the children on the landing above.

                                     GRACE
                         Do you know what time it is? Go 
                         back to bed, this instant.

               They dart out of sight.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               BILL and SUE slide under the bedclothes. SUE is whimpering.

                                     BILL
                         We're not going to be like them 
                         when we grow up. We're not even 
                         like them now.

               He picks up the earphones and twiddles with the crystal 
               wireless. It is the News again. BILL fiddles with the lead 
               soldiers, his eyes getting heavy.

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

               BLACK AND WHITE

               Infantry advance as shells bust all about them. CLIVE and 
               MAC push forward, side by side. MAC is hit, goes down, 
               cries out for help, but CLIVE does not seem to notice.

               A muddy field. Silence. Aftermath of battle. BILL searches 
               among the dead. They are half-buried, covered in mud, all 
               one texture with the earth. BILL finds CLIVE and MAC, lying 
               side by side, dead. He is quite unconcerned, pulls his 
               father's Sam Browne which slips off easily. He wipes the 
               mud away and starts to eat it. It seems to be made of 
               chocolate.

               EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

               COLOUR

               A 1938 Vauxhall 12 is parked outside a recruiting centre. 
               A boisterous crowd of young men mills about, passing in 
               and out, encouraging each other, cheering each new man who 
               steps out a soldier.  Next door is a pub and there is a 
               continuous exchange of customers between the two 
               establishments. BILL and SUE wait inside the car. She is 
               whining in the back, sucking her thumb. BILL sits in the 
               driving seat, pretending to drive, making all the right 
               noises.

                                     SUE
                         He's never going to come back.  
                         He's gone off to be a soldier and 
                         Mummy doesn't even know.

                                     BILL
                         It doesn't matter, I can drive the 
                         car home.

                                     SUE
                         You wouldn't.

                                     BILL
                         Would.

                                     SUE
                         You couldn't.

                                     BILL
                         Could.

               CLIVE, arm in arm with a PAL, comes out of the pub and 
               over to the car. He gets in after much handshaking and 
               back slapping.

                                     CLIVE
                         Sorry, kids. Joined up. I needed 
                         some Dutch courage to tell your 
                         mother.

               The PAL opens the passenger door and leans in.

                                     PAL
                         Never say die!

                                     CLIVE
                         Steady the Buffs.

                                     PAL
                         Up the Arsenal!

               CLIVE leans across and slams the door closed. The PAL waves 
               at the window. CLIVE pulls away. The PAL runs alongside, 
               waving. CLIVE laughs and waves back.

                                     CLIVE
                         He's one of the best.

               Still the PAL keeps up with the car, running frantically.

                                     SUE
                         Daddy you shut his hand in the 
                         door.

               The PAL jumps on the running board and crouches there, red 
               faced, eyes bulging. He waves desperately at the window.

                                     CLIVE
                         The silly bugger.

               He pulls up the and opens the door. The PAL clasps his 
               hand and writhes in agony.

                                     CLIVE
                         You silly bugger. We're trying to 
                         win a war and you start off by 
                         shutting your fingers in the bloody 
                         car door.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY

               CLIVE is putting the car on blocks, taking off the wheels.  
               BILL helps him.

                                     CLIVE
                         That's it for the duration.
                              (runs a duster over 
                              the bodywork)
                         I shall miss the old girl. Pop in 
                         and give her a polish, Billy boy.  
                         Just now and then. A car needs to 
                         be cherished.

               GRACE has appeared at the door and heard some of this.

                                     GRACE
                         Has Sue got it right?

                                     CLIVE
                         What's that?

                                     GRACE
                         You joined up.

                                     CLIVE
                         Oh, that.

                                     GRACE
                         I wish you could have told me 
                         yourself.
                              (he takes Grace in 
                              his arms.)
                         Oh, Grace, it's not for long.  
                         They say it'll be over by Christmas.

               CLIVE laughs and tickles her, trying to get round her, 
               keep it light. GRACE laughs despite herself. BILL makes a 
               face, disgusted by the show of sentiment.

                                     GRACE
                         Don't be so daft. Act your age.
                              (extricates herself)
                         I can't cope on my own. I'd better 
                         let the children go.

               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY

               CLIVE leads BILL out on to the lawn, goes down on one knee 
               and puts his hand on the boy's shoulder. He looks solemnly 
               into his son's eyes.

                                     CLIVE
                         Billy boy. Before I go, there's 
                         something I want to tell you.  
                         You're old enough now. It's time.
                              (produces a cricket 
                              ball from his 
                              pocket.)
                         The Googly. Your hand is too small 
                         to master it, but not to start 
                         practising. Anyway, I'm going to 
                         pass on the secret now, father to 
                         son, in case anything happens to 
                         me.
                              (demonstrates)
                         You know the off-break, right?

               He flicks the ball out of his wrist. BILL nods.

                                     CLIVE
                         And the leg-break?

               BILL knows that too. The ball comes out of his hand, 
               spinning the other way.

                                     CLIVE
                         Now, the googly looks like a leg 
                         break, but it's really an off break. 
                         Got it? Like this.

                                     BILL
                         It's like telling fibs.

                                     CLIVE
                         That's it. When you tell a lie, 
                         you hope to get away with it.  
                         When someone else does, you want 
                         to find them out. A good batsman 
                         will spot a googly. A good bowler 
                         will hide it. Always remember that, 
                         son.

               BILL flicks the ball this way and that, experimenting.  
               CLIVE watches him tenderly, a moment of perfect harmony. 
               He folds BILL in his arms, holding him fast.

               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - DAY

               BILL swings on the front gate looking back at his mother, 
               SUE and DAWN bidding their farewells to CLIVE in a confusion 
               of tears and forced gaiety.

               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - FRONT GARDEN - DAY

               CLIVE finally strides away, head high, a military spring 
               already in his step. Behind him GRACE shuts the door as 
               though closing a chapter of their lives.

                                     BILL
                         Dad! Dad!

               CLIVE, now some twenty yards away, looks back. BILL throws 
               the cricket ball and CLIVE catches it neatly. He smiles 
               and marches down Rosehill Avenue. BILL is puzzled as CLIVE 
               shows no sign of returning the ball. He calls after him.

                                     BILL
                         Dad!

               CLIVE is now eighty yards down the street. He suddenly 
               turns smiling broadly, and with a prodigious throw he send 
               the ball in a high arc towards his son. BILL juggles his 
               position, cups his hands, gets under it as the hard, heavy 
               ball hurtles downwards. At the last moment he loses his 
               nerve and jumps back, letting the ball thump onto the lawn.  
               He looks towards CLIVE, full of shame. BILL is relieved to 
               see that CLIVE has turned the corner.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               BILL winces as he and SUE are passed from hand to hand, 
               hugged and kissed by many female members of the family - 
               DAWN, GRANDMA and GRACE'S three sisters, FAITH, HOPE and 
               CHARITY. MOLLY is on hand with MAC, the only male. On the 
               table are the remains of the farewell party, an iced cake, 
               balloons, gaudy wrapping paper. Encouraging cries fly about. 
               "Aren't you lucky?" "Isn't it exciting?"  "I wish I could 
               hide in your suitcase." From the smothering embraces, BILL 
               casts a pleading look to MAC who reaches out and hauls him 
               from the women.

                                     MAC
                         You survived that. The war should 
                         be no problem.

               GRACE ties a label to BILL'S lapel. It declares his name 
               and other details.

                                     GRACE
                         Time to go.

               She leads the children out MAC follows, carrying two 
               suitcases.

               EXT. WATERLOO STATION - DAY

               MAC and GRACE lead BILL and SUE into the concourse where 
               hundreds of children are assembled, each wearing an 
               identification label. The noise is overwhelming. The 
               organizers shout into megaphones. One buy has fainted and 
               is put on a stretcher by St. Johns Ambulance men and, to 
               get through the crowd, they hold the stretcher above their 
               heads. The boy recovers, sits up and waves to his friends.  
               The parents throng behind the barrier and they follow him.  
               WOMEN'S VOLUNTARY SERVICE (W.V.S) Volunteers stand by.

                                     W.V.S. WOMAN
                         Australia?

               GRACE nods. The W.V.S WOMAN examines the labels on SUE and 
               BILL and checks them against her list. The steam ad noise 
               have suffocating effect on GRACE.

                                     W.V.S. WOMAN
                         Say goodbye and pass them through.

               GRACE weeps as she embraces SUE. BILL fights back the tears 
               and turns away embarrassed when his mother wants a kiss 
               from him.

                                     BILL
                         I'm going to miss the war and it's 
                         all your fault.

               They are sucked into the enclosure and quickly disappear 
               among the throng of refugee children. GRACE tries to follow 
               with her eyes, searching for them hungrily. They disappear.  
               MAC flinches at the pain he sees in her face. She lunges 
               forward, and tries to push through the barrier.

                                     GRACE
                         I can't do it. What's the point?

                                     MAC
                         It's just the wrench, Grace. It's 
                         for their sake.

               He tries to restrain her, but she breaks free.

                                     GRACE
                         Let me through, I want my children.

                                     W.V.S. WOMAN
                         No one goes in there. You signed 
                         the forms, didn't you?

                                     GRACE
                         Yes, I did. And now I want them 
                         back.

                                     W.V.S. WOMAN
                         Too late. Plenty of others would've 
                         been glad of their places.

               The W.V.S. WOMAN and an ARP MAN are forcibly holding her.  
               MAC cannot bear to watch her pain. He leaps over the 
               barrier, grabs SUE and BILL and hoists them out of the 
               pen.  BILL is acutely embarrassed at the scene his mother 
               is making. He struggles to get free of MAC.

                                     BILL
                         Let me alone. I want to go. I want 
                         to go.

               MAC swings them over to GRACE. She snatches up SUE and 
               hugs her. Over the child's shoulder her eye is drawn to a 
               poster depicting a ghostly Hitler hovering over a mother 
               and her children. He whispers in her ear "Take them back".

                                     BILL
                         In front of everybody. They were 
                         all looking at us. Why did you 
                         have to do it?

               GRACE is shattered, drained. She becomes calm almost dreamy.

                                     GRACE
                         Please yourself.
                              (turns to Mac)
                         Let them go, if they want.

                                     MAC
                         Grace!

               GRACE turns back to the barrier, which is still defended 
               by the W.V.S WOMAN with the clipboard.

                                     W.V.S. WOMAN
                         Changed your mind?

                                     GRACE
                         Yes.

                                     W.V.S WOMAN
                         Well, you're too late. Apply again. 
                         On your head be it.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               BILL glues balsa wood wings on to a model Spitfire.  
               Opposite him, across the dining-room table, GRACE is cutting 
               something out of the newspaper. DAWN'S school books are 
               spread out on the table, but she has abandoned them in 
               favour of a dancing lesson by Victor Sylvester on the 
               wireless. She steers her imaginary partner between the 
               furniture, her face concentrates, trying to follow the 
               steps.

                                     VICTOR SYLVESTER (V.O.)
                         Slow, quick, quick, slow. Right 
                         forward.. left together.. Three, 
                         four.. Back together.. Turn..  
                         One, two.. Quick, quick, slow.

               GRACE crosses the room towards the kitchen. DAWN passes in 
               from of her and she falls into step partnering her daughter 
               in the dance.

                                     DAWN
                         You know it? It must be an old 
                         one.

                                     GRACE
                         Ancient. Have you finished your 
                         homework?

                                     DAWN
                         After this dance.

               She mouths the steps, "Forward..quick, quick, slow"

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

               GRACE pins the newspaper cutting to a bulletin board which 
               also displays a 'war map' with pins in it showing the 
               progress of hostilities. The cutting is a David Low cartoon 
               showing a soldier standing defiantly on a rocky promontory 
               looking across a stormy sea towards France, saying 'Very 
               well alone.' She is deeply moved by it. BILL enters and 
               watches her, sensitive of her mood, but he has a mournful 
               duty. He takes out the pins, representing the German Army 
               in Russia.

                                     BILL
                         I've got to move the Germans to 
                         Minsk. They've taken Minsk.

               GRACE lays a restraining hand on his shoulder.

                                     GRACE
                         Tomorrow. Give them one more night 
                         of freedom. Move them in the 
                         morning.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Swirling to the dance music, DAWN comes face to face with 
               the clock on the mantelpiece and registers the hours. She 
               dives for the wireless and searches for another station.  
               She is satisfied when she hears the stenorian tones of 
               Lord Haw-Haw's nightly propaganda broadcast from Germany.

                                     DAWN
                         Quick! Lord Haw-Haw! He's starting.

               BILL scampers in. GRACE hovers by the door.

                                     LORD HAW-HAW (V.O.)
                         ..the soldiers like to wager among 
                         themselves, what day will the German 
                         army enter Moscow? One thing is 
                         certain: much sooner than anyone 
                         thought. From here in Berlin, 
                         listeners in Britain, I can give 
                         some very definite news.  There 
                         will be a bomber raid on London 
                         tonight, the fourteenth night in 
                         succession. Look out for bombs if 
                         you live in Carshalton or Croydon. 
                         There will be incendiary attacks 
                         if you live in Fulham and 
                         Hammersmith. And watch out in Kew; 
                         be alert in Walthamstow.

               BILL looks at his mother, DAWN gets up and goes over to 
               the wireless, staring at it.

                                     BILL
                         That's us.

                                     GRACE
                         It's just German Propaganda.

                                     DAWN
                         He always knows.

                                     GRACE
                         Half the time he's bluffing.

               A moment of dread hangs over the room. GRACE summons her 
               resolve and bustles over to the wireless and snaps it off.

                                     GRACE
                         Bill, off to bed.

               She gives him a shove towards the door to silence his 
               protest. She takes DAWN by the shoulder and presses her 
               into a chair and pushes her head into her homework.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Sirens are sounding, one after the other, some distant, 
               some close, then the one at the end of the street, like 
               dogs howling in the night waking other dogs. Three German 
               bombers, a Heinkel, a Dornier and a Stuka, fly in formation 
               across the black sky. GRACE appears behind the model planes, 
               which hang on threads from the ceiling, wakes BILL and SUE 
               and they stumble out of bed.

               INT. ROHAN'S HOUSE - STAIRS - NIGHT

               GRACE leads BILL and SUE down the stairs. They sleep on 
               their feet in this familiar routine. DAWN is still dressed 
               below, playing dance records on the gramophone and finishing 
               homework.

                                     GRACE
                         We better go to the shelter.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               They open the French windows and fierce wind cuts into the 
               room.

                                     DAWN
                         It's freezing out.

               GRACE hesitates, then closes the windows.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

               They squeeze themselves into the tiny space under the 
               stairs, close the door and light a candle. BILL and SUE 
               complain irritably as they try to arrange their limbs. The 
               shoving and pushing wakes them up.

               GRACE gives each of them a biscuit from a tin.

                                     DAWN
                         What would we do if a German came 
                         into the house?

                                     GRACE
                         Don't be silly, Dawn.

                                     DAWN
                         Well, why do you always bring the 
                         carving knife in here?

               DAWN picks up the knife, pretending to hear someone outside 
               the cupboard door. She presses her ear to the thin wooden 
               partition. BILL'S eyes bulge. He is half convinced. Even 
               GRACE looks uneasy. SUE, reacting automatically to crisis, 
               pulls on her red and white 'Mickey Mouse' gasmask. Suddenly 
               DAWN thrusts the knife through a crack in the boards. She 
               makes a blood curdling cry.

               GRACE slaps her, amused, despite herself. BILL seizes DAWN 
               from behind and pulls her back on top of him. They writhe 
               and giggle. BILL cocks an ear.

                                     BILL
                         Flak!

               They are stock-still, straining to hear. He is right. The 
               anti-aircraft guns have started up. Their crisp 'crump' 
               sound gets closer and more frequent. Another separate sound 
               intrudes - falling bombs. The explosions are at regular 
               intervals, each one louder than the last.

                                     BILL
                         Basket bombing Counts between the 
                         bombs Two and three and four and 
                         five and six and..

               The next bomb falls closer.

                                     GRACE
                         Why didn't I take you to the 
                         shelter?

               Her hands tough and caress the children, as though weaving 
               a protective charm over them.

                                     BILL
                         ...four and five and six and...

               Another, louder still. They sit tense and straining every 
               muscle, willing the bombs away.

                                     GRACE
                         If only I'd let you go to Australia.

                                     BILL
                         ...and five and six and...

               It is deafening, shaking the house.

                                     DAWN
                         The next one is ours. Either it 
                         hits us or it goes past us.

                                     BILL
                         ...and four and five...

                                     DAWN
                         Please God. Not on us. Drop it on 
                         Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.

                                     BILL
                         ...and six...

               It drops, some way past them. They slump exhausted against 
               each other. A fire-engine bell approaches. The flask goes 
               on. DAWN gets up, untangles herself from the others.

                                     DAWN
                         I'm not going to die like a rat in 
                         a trap. Let me out of here.

               Staggers out of the cupboard.

                                     DAWN
                         I'm going outside.

               BILL scrambles after her.

                                     GRACE
                         Wait. Don't.

               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - NIGHT

               DAWN runs out. Searchlights criss-cross the sky. Anti 
               aircraft shells make little white puffs in the black sky, 
               the sound coming much later. Up the road, a house is 
               blazing. A fire engine swings by. ARP MEN run in the street. 
               DAWN dances in the tiny front garden.

                                     DAWN
                         Quick, quick.. slow, quick, slow.

               BILL hesitates in the porch.

                                     DAWN
                         It's lovely. Lovely. Does little 
                         Billy want to see the fireworks?

               BILL runs out, sees something by the kerb and picks it up.

                                     BILL
                         Shrapnel! And it's still hot.

               He tosses it from hand to hand. At the far end of the 
               street, the skyline of central London is silhouetted against 
               a burning sky. GRACE suddenly laughs at the sight of the 
               burning house down the street. She is shocked at her own 
               reaction.

                                     GRACE
                         Come in at once, or I wash my hands 
                         of you.

               A shell bursts right overhead and they duck into the open 
               doorway. The four of them are framed there, looking up at 
               the savage sky where the Battle of Britain rages. BILL 
               watches enraptured.

               EXT. THE CITY OF LONDON - NIGHT

                         St. Paul's sites at the heart of 
                         the blazing city.

                         DAWN, in school uniform, rides off 
                         on her bicycle. BILL and SUE come 
                         out with satchels and gasmasks. 
                         GRACE watches them making their 
                         way along the street scarred and 
                         damaged by the night's bombing. 
                         PEOPLE scratch in the rubble to 
                         salvage their belongings.

               BILL'S eyes are fixed on the ground searching from shrapnel. 
               Now and then he stops to retrieve a piece. SUE dawdles 
               along behind him, one foot in the gutter, the other on the 
               kerb.

               BILL looks up as he hears a voice groaning from a bomb 
               site. SUE is now some way ahead. The street is suddenly 
               deserted. He looks back at the bomb-scarred house. The 
               front of the house is gone and flowery wallpapers are 
               revealed. The voice cries out again, a panting, rasping 
               moan. BILL ventures forward. Now a WOMAN'S VOICE, groaning.

                                     MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Oh fuck... oh fuck... oh fuck...

               A white hand and forearm stretch up from the debris. BILL 
               shifts position until he can SEE TWO HEADS, a MALE and 
               FEMALE, pressed against a mattress which is leaning against 
               a broken wall. He darts back on the street and looks for 
               help. The street is still deserted. He hesitates, then 
               runs up the street for all he is worth.

               EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

               BILL and SUE are late. They run into the yard where the 
               other children are already lining up in their respective 
               classes. The HEADMASTER is a wizened Welshman, too old for 
               military service. He struts up and down.

                                     HEADMASTER
                         Dressing from the right!

               He points an accusing finger at BILL.

                                     HEADMASTER
                         Late! My study before prayers.

               They shuffle into their correct spacing.

                                     HEADMASTER
                         Eyes front! Keep still down there, 
                         you little ones. It's discipline 
                         that wins wars.

               Inspects his troops.

                                     HEADMASTER
                         Now quick march. Left... right... 
                         left... right. Swing those arms.

               BILL flinches and winces as the cane strikes his hand.

               INT. SCHOOL ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY

               The children are praying, eyes closed, hands joined. On 
               the dais, the teachers, mostly women, are lined up.

                                     HEADMASTER
                         Oh God, bring destruction to our 
                         enemies. Make these young one's 
                         true soldiers of the Lord. Guide 
                         Mr. Churchill's hand in the cunning 
                         war.

               Some of the boy's covertly swap pieces of shrapnel and 
               cigarette cards as the HEADMASTER'S tirade grows in passion, 
               but BILL is mesmerized and fearful of this daily rhetoric. 
               He blows on his hands, shakes them to alleviate the pain 
               inflicted by the caning.

                                     HEADMASTER
                         Let our righteous shells smite 
                         down the Messerschmitts and the 
                         Fokkers.

               BILL'S face, twisted in anxious anticipation, awaits the 
               next blow.

               INT. SCHOOL ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY

                                     HEADMASTER
                         Lord, send troublesome dreams to 
                         Herr Hitler. Let him not sleep the 
                         sleep of the innocent. And comfort 
                         our warriors at the fronts. Brighten 
                         their swords, burnish their bullets

               BILL jerks convulsively and grins as the cane connects.

               INT. SCHOOL ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY

               The HEADMASTER reaches a climatic peak, then is silent, 
               head sinking to his chest. He continues, very quietly.

                                     HEADMASTER
                         We beseech Thee, Oh Lord, to have 
                         mercy on these Thy children.

                                     HEADMASTER
                         We dedicate our studies this day 
                         to the war effort.

               INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

               BILL covertly shows the welts on his hands to his neighbour 
               as he and thirty other nice-year-old children are harangued 
               by a large red-faced woman, their TEACHER. She sprays a 
               lot of saliva as she speaks. A coloured linen projection 
               of the world is hung over the blackboard. She slaps it 
               with her cane, pointing to many countries .

                                     TEACHER
                         Pink... pink... pink... pink...  
                         What are the pink bits, Rohan?

               BILL stands up, still seeking balm for his hands - he has 
               them tucked under his armpits.

                                     BILL
                         They're ours, Miss.

                                     TEACHER
                         Yes, the British Empire.

               A boy, HARPER, sits in front row and is in saliva range.  
               Each time the TEACHER turns back to the blackboard, the 
               boy wipes his desk flamboyantly with a cloth, much to the 
               spluttering amusement of his classmates.

                                     TEACHER
                         Harper, what fraction of the earth's 
                         surface is British?

                                     HARPER
                         Don't know, Miss.

                                     TEACHER
                         Anyone?

               A girl shoots up her hand. JENNIFER BAKER.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Two-fifths, Miss.

                                     TEACHER
                         Yes. Two-fifths. Ours. And that's 
                         what the war is all about. Men are 
                         fighting and dying to save the 
                         pink bits for you ungrateful little 
                         twerps.

               The pinched little faces find this notion difficult to 
               absorb. They stare back blankly at the British Empire. A 
               SIREN SOUNDS an air raid warning.

                                     TEACHER
                         Books away! Scramble!

               They grab their gasmasks and run from the class, cheering.

               EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

               The children swarm to the shelters, which are long narrow 
               concrete structures in sandbags to absorb blast.

               INT. SHELTERS - DAY

               The children file in mostly, laughing and chatting. There 
               are clattering duckboards on the ground affording cover 
               from an inch or two of water. Along each side of the 
               shelters are narrow benches. The children sit facing each 
               other. The HEADMASTER'S steel-studded boots hammer noisily 
               down the steps. He raises his arm high.

                                     HEADMASTER
                         Gasmasks on!

               They open up their cases and pull on their masks. The 
               HEADMASTER conducts their breathing,. Moving his arms up 
               and down to indicate a rhythm.

                                     HEADMASTER
                         Slowly... in... out...don't panic... 
                         in... out...

               There is a HISSING SOUND as they inhale, then a RASPING 
               comic RASPBERRY as the air is pushed out of the sides of 
               the rubber masks.

                                     HEADMASTER
                         In... out... These masks are given 
                         to us to filter away abominations 
                         of the enemy.

               He marches up and down in the narrow gap between the scabby 
               knees of children.

                                     HEADMASTER
                         Now, nine times table. One times 
                         nine is nine...

               The  children's muffled voices chant the multiplication 
               table rubbery GURGLING SOUNDS merge from the gasmasks.  
               Hidden behind his mask, BILL finally gives was to angry 
               tears. He sticks out his tongue as the HEADMASTER passes 
               by.

                                     HEADMASTER
                         Two times nine is eighteen...
                              (And so on)

               BILL and SUE turn into their street on their way home from 
               school, looking lifeless and dull, but their faces lights 
               up with excitement as the fifty-foot length of a BARRAGE 
               BALLOON suddenly rises from behind the houses to the distant 
               SOUND of CHILDREN CHEERING. They sprint into their house.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DAY

               BILL and SUE run through the hallway and into the living 
               room, scattering satchels, hats, gasmasks in their wake.  
               Their excitement is far too intense to explain to the 
               startled GRACE. They burst out through the French Windows 
               into the Garden.

               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY

               They run to the back fence. In the waste ground beyond the 
               garden, where a further row of house was to be built when 
               war intervened, BILL and SUE witness a TEAM of mostly 
               AIRWOMEN, (WRAFS) intent on launching the BALLOON Some 
               twenty WOMEN, each holding a tether, are paying out their 
               lines under the rhythmic commands of their LEADER. There 
               is a c able attached to the winch mounted on a TRUCK, and 
               this is wound out as the balloon rises. The balloon has a 
               comforting, humorous aspect, and the children laugh and 
               giggle as they watch.

               NEWSREEL

               BLACK AND WHITE

               Like a school of basking whales, barrage balloons fill the 
               sky. It Is a newsreel of the Battle of Britain. A dramatic 
               scene follows: A DOG FIGHT between SPITFIRES and GERMAN 
               BOMBERS. A patriotic, punning commentary, pulsating music.

                         GRACE and her three children are 
                         glimpsed in their seats, watching. 
                         BILL is totally engrossed, 
                         enthralled. Out of habit, he 
                         simulates the engine noise of the 
                         planes and the clutter of cannon 
                         fire.

               Suddenly a caption is superimposed on the screen:

               AIR RAID IN PROGRESS - YOU ARE ADVISED TO TAKE SHELTER.

               GRACE leads them out. They shuffle up the aisle, dragging 
               their feet, watching over their shoulders as they go.

                                     BILL

                         It's not the same.

               EXT. ROSEHILL AVENUE - DAY

               A number of PEOPLE have come out of their suburban gardens 
               and look up at the pale-blue-winter sky. GRACE, SUE and 
               BILL are among them.

               A SQUADRON OF SPITFIRES is attacking a formation of GERMAN 
               BOMBERS. They are distant black dots high above the barrage 
               balloons. The planes WHEEL and DIVE and give a splendid 
               display of AEROBATICS. Being so high, there is almost no 
               sound of engines or cannon and the feeling of unreality is 
               heightened.

               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - FRONT GARDEN - DAY

               One of the GERMAN PLANES is HIT as the PILOT leaps from 
               his burning plane and a PARACHUTE blossoms and checks his 
               fall.  GRACE draws the children back into the corner of 
               the house as the PLANE CRASHES. They creep out again. The 
               dog fight continues but the German planes have lost 
               formation and dispersed. The battle has become straggly 
               and is rapidly disappearing from view. Meanwhile, the 
               PILOT'S PARACHUTE drifts ever CLOSER as he descends, causing 
               great excitement.

               EXT. ROSEHILL AVENUE - DAY

               NEIGHBOURS run in the direction of the FALLING AIRMAN. 
               Some WOMEN carry garden forks and others pick up rocks on 
               the way. GRACE and the children hurry back into the house.

               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY

               They go out through the back gate to join an excited throng 
               of NEIGHBOURS.

               EXT. BUILDING SITE - DAY

               The PILOT drifts on to the wasteland where the barrage 
               balloon bravely flies. People rush in from all sides, as 
               he makes an elegant landing and gathers his parachute. A 
               crowd of women, children and OLD MEN encircle him. He looks 
               no more than twenty-years old. The crowd watches every 
               move he makes. They edge back as he reaches into his pocket. 
               But it is only a silk handkerchief that he pulls out. He 
               wipes his hands, puts it away. He moves to an empty oil 
               drum and sits on it. He crosses his legs and carefully 
               lights a cigarette. His affects the greatest nonchalance 
               as he smokes. A little way off a huge hoarding gives the 
               impression of the houses that were to be built on this 
               site, an idyll of suburban bliss. The PILOT looks at the 
               idealized family group on the poster and then at GRACE and 
               her children. He smiles ironically.

                                     GRACE
                         England is so beautiful, and he 
                         had to land here of all places.

               Finally, a rather aged POLICE CONSTABLE arrives on the 
               scene. The onlookers thrust him forward. He advances a few 
               paces, the stops. Hesitating, quite at a loss. He looks at 
               the PILOT then back to the crowd. They egg him on.  
               Resolutely, the CONSTABLE pulls out his truncheon and steps 
               forward.

                                     CONSTABLE
                         Now then. Now then.

               The German PILOT gets languidly to his feet. The POLICEMAN 
               Retreats a pace. A TITTER or two ripples through the crowd.  
               Encouragingly, the PILOT half raises his hands in the 'stick-
               em-up' position, the cigarette held delicately between the 
               pale fingers. It is a taunting but oddly gentle gesture. 
               The CONSTABLE takes him by the arm and leads him off. The 
               crowd opens up to let them pass. As he does, DAWN catches 
               his eye and he winks at her. She gives him a flirtatious 
               smile. GRACE is horrified. She seizes DAWN and forces her 
               face against her own breast, hiding her gaze from the 
               lewdness of the enemy.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DAWN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               DAWN is bent over, looking between her legs at BILL as he 
               tries to draw a stocking seam up the back of her calf. He 
               must continuously lick the brown crayon. She holds a hand 
               mirror in such a way that she can see the progress of his 
               work.

                                     DAWN
                         It's crooked. Rub that bit out and 
                         do it again.

               She cuff's him and he resumes. He stops halfway up her 
               thigh.

                                     DAWN
                         Well, keep going. Don't stop now.

               He goes higher, then hesitates again.

                                     BILL
                         Nobody is going to see this far 
                         up.

               She leers at him.

                                     DAWN
                         Don't be so sure.

               He blushes. She stands up and pirouettes, her flared skirt 
               swings out, exposing her knickers.

                                     DAWN
                         When I jitterbug.

               INT. DANCE HALL - NIGHT

               DAWN, swinging as she jitterbugs with a young CANADIAN 
               SOLDIER, BRUCE. They are good. He hoists her over his 
               shoulder. They whirl and swirl. The music changes to a 
               slow waltz.

                                     BRUCE
                         It was great for me, how was it 
                         for you.

                                     DAWN
                         A bit too quick.

                                     BRUCE
                         Well. Now we can do it slow. Are 
                         those some kind of stockings you're 
                         wearing?

                                     DAWN
                         They might be.

                                     BRUCE
                         I mean, no suspenders. They just 
                         kinda' disappear up your ass.

               She slaps his face. He Holds up his hands in mock horror 
               and backs away.

                                     BRUCE
                         Quit it. Help me someone. The girl's 
                         beating on me.

               Jeers and laughter from fellow CANADIANS on the dance floor. 
               DAWN turns and walks off, head in the air, but not 
               forgetting to wriggle her bottom as she goes. BRUCE grins 
               admiringly and stalks after her on tiptoe. His pals love 
               it.

               EXT. SKY - DAY

               BLACK AND WHITE

               A SPITFIRE is attacked by a GERMAN PLANE. The pilot twists 
               and turns away, trying to escape. The pilot is BILL! His 
               eyes bulge with fear as the enemy bullets rip into his 
               fuselage. The rat-a-tat of the gunfire wakes him up.

               INT. ROHAN'S HOUSE - CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               COLOUR

               BILL opens his eyes, and they alight upon his MODEL SPITFIRE 
               suspended on a thread over his bed. The cannon fire 
               gradually resolves into a TAPPING on the WINDOW.  Blearily 
               he gets up and unlatches it. A dishevelled DAWN climbs 
               through, threading her way between the model airplanes 
               hanging from the ceiling and stepping down over the table 
               on which BILL has his shrapnel collection spread.

                                     BILL
                              (whispering)
                         Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a 
                         brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S 
                         face.

                                     DAWN
                              (whispering)
                         I'm starting my own collection.

                                     BILL
                              (impressed)
                         It's Canadian. Where'd you get it?

               She pockets it and creeps out of the door, smiling smugly.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DAWN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               DAWN pulls back the covers and slides into bed, fully 
               dressed. She is asleep as her head hits the pillow. A 
               distant SIREN starts-up,warning of an air-raid.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - GRACE'S BEDDROOM - NIGHT

               GRACE is instantly alert as the SIRENS call to one another, 
               coming CLOSER. She throws on her dressing-gown, pulls on 
               her fur-lined boots, picks up the ever-packed bag at her 
               bedside and hurries out of the door.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               GRACE shakes BILL and SUE awake.

                                     GRACE
                         Bill, Sue. Air-raid!

               They tumble out of bed and into their dressing-gowns like 
               automata.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DAWN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               GRACE enters, shakes DAWN who does not respond. GRACE pulls 
               back the covers and is surprised to see DAWN fully dressed, 
               wearing make-up and with slightly crooked seams down the 
               back of her legs.

                                     GRACE
                         Dawn, what have you been up to?

               DAWN murmurs her protest. GRACE pulls her out of bed, but 
               DAWN crawls back in.

                                     DAWN
                         I'm not going to that shelter.  
                         I'd sooner die.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - STAIRS - NIGHT

               BOMBS are already falling. GRACE switches on a light and 
               hurries down the stairs leading her two children through 
               the familiar routine. She calls back. BILL bumps down the 
               stairs, on his bottom, half asleep.

                                     GRACE
                         Dawn! Come down here!

               She starts back up the stairs, but is halted by a BOMB 
               dropping close by. She runs down again, scoops up the two 
               little ones and heads from the living room.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               As they approach the French windows, another BOMB EXPLODES 
               very close by.  Before its sound is heard, there is a 
               tremendous BLAST, which rips off the blackout curtains and 
               sends them floating into the room. The WINDOWS are TORN 
               OUT and most of the fragmented glass hangs limply from the 
               brown paper that criss-crosses the panes for just this 
               eventuality.

               Every loose object is hurled inwards. The room light 
               flickers on and off and shell-bursts illuminate the room 
               from without. GRACE and the children are thrown back against 
               the wall, but before they hit it the process is reversed 
               and the blast is sucked out again. They are pulled back 
               towards the windows together with the glass and loose 
               fragments of the room. This all happens slowly as though 
               the room is filled with water and the windows were a 
               reversible sluice gate. SUE'S long blonde-hair is first 
               blown, then sucked across her face. Then comes the SOUND 
               of the EXPLOSION itself, Which seems to have the effect od 
               draining water from the room. The People and the bric-a 
               brac all drop to the floor, dead weights once more.

               The children clutch their ears, SCREAMING. GRACE has one 
               or two cuts. She gathers up the children, spreading her 
               blood on them, and frightens herself, confused as to whom 
               the blood belongs. She wipes it away, crying out a desperate 
               prayer.

                                     GRACE
                         Please, God. Take me, but spare 
                         them.

               She carries SUE and drags BILL through the shattered French 
               windows, out into the garden and towards the Anderson 
               shelter.

               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - GARDEN - NIGHT

               Two more BOMBS EXPLODE, further way, but still close enough 
               for the blast to force them off balance. They stumble and 
               fall, covering their ears against the pressure. They tumble 
               into the SHELTER, stepping into several inches of water.  
               The ack-ack keeps up the barrage, and the EXPLODING SHELLS 
               intermittently LIGHT UP the SKY. GRACE, mumbling Dawn's 
               name, clambers out of the shelter to fetch her.

               GRACE sees DAWN coming down the garden. She looks dazed as 
               she staggers quite slowly with one arm wound around her 
               head. As she gets closer, GRACE sees that her eyes are 
               glazed and she is MOANING. GRACE leads her into the SHELTER 
               and covers her with a blanket. SUE is fast asleep already 
               in spite of everything. DAWN looks at her mother accusingly.

                                     DAWN
                         You don't care if I die. How could 
                         you leave me there? Even if you 
                         don't love me?

               DAWN desperately wants her mother to take her in her arms, 
               but GRACE sits stiffly upright, unyielding.

                                     DAWN
                         Tell me the truth. You had to get 
                         married, didn't you? Because of 
                         me.

                                     GRACE
                         The ideas you get in your head.

                                     DAWN
                         That's why you never liked me.  
                         I'm different from you. Well, 
                         everything's different now, so it 
                         doesn't matter. So there.

               Finally DAWN bends forward and puts her head on her mother's 
               lap and cries, at first softly, the more bitterly.  GRACE 
               holds her and rocks her at last. BILL watches this, 
               perplexed, as perhaps he always will be, by the complex 
               emotional interplay that passes between women.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               GRACE and DAWN are cleaning up the debris. Some plaster 
               has fallen and there is a pall of dust. They are singing 
               merrily, glad to be alive, to have survived the night.

               Outside the front window, BILL and SUE can be seen, having 
               ventured out, eager to explore the damage done to Rosehill 
               Avenue.

               EXT. ROSEHILL AVENUE - DAY

               BILL picks up shrapnel. Several houses have been damaged, 
               one heavily so. Outside this house, a handful of people 
               has gathered watching the ARP MEN as they comb through the 
               smouldering ruins. Two of them are working a stirrup pump 
               as they extinguish a small fire in a corner of a room. 
               Some children come up to BILL and SUE. They are flushed 
               and excited, bursting with news. One buy, ROGER, blurts it 
               out.

                                     ROGER
                         Pauline's mum got killed.

                                     BILL
                         No, she didn't.

                                     ROGER
                         Yes, she did, didn't she?

               He appeals to his companions, particularly to a GIRL, JANE, 
               a little older than the others.

                                     JANE
                         Yes, she did. Killed stone dead.

                                     ROGER
                         You can ask her. Ask Pauline.

               He points over at the ruined house, and sure enough there 
               is PAULINE, a girl of twelve. From time to time, a silicosis 
               NEIGHBOUR goes over to her, offering help, but PAULINE 
               shakes her head and looks away. She just's stands there as 
               though her mother has told her to wait on that spot and 
               not to talk to any strangers until she got back.  The 
               children drift across towards her and stop a few feet away. 
               They stare intently, studying her face.

                                     ROGER
                         Isn't that right? You're mum got 
                         killed last night?

               PAULINE nods affirmatively. A BOY throws a miniature 
               parachute into the air. It opens up and drops neatly at 
               PAULINE'S feet.

                                     ROGER
                         There you are. I told you.

               He jabs BILL in the ribs, finding a physical vent for his 
               excitement. BILL lashes back at him with a violent anger 
               that scares and quells the other boy. The group falls 
               silent.

               PAULINE steals glances at them out of the corner of her 
               eye. She is not a popular girl, careful and self-conscious, 
               and she cannot help enjoying this situation. She flushes.

                                     JANE
                         Do you feel rotten, Pauline?

               PAULINE shakes her head. The children move away from her 
               and start to fool around, scrapping and laughing, but when 
               they get back within a certain distance of PAULINE, they 
               grow quiet and move away again. BILL nudges SUE.

                                     BILL
                         Go and ask her if she wants to 
                         play.

                                     SUE
                         Ask her yourself.

                                     BILL
                         You do it. You're a girl.

               SUE edges slowly towards her, not without nervous glances 
               back at her brother.

                                     SUE
                         Pauline.

               PAULINE does not deign to answer the little girl.

                                     SUE
                         Pauline. Do you want some shrapnel?

               She has fragments in her hand. She offers then to PAULINE.  
               It is possibly part of the bomb that killed her mother.  
               PAULINE shakes her head.

                                     SUE
                         Do you want to play?

               PAULINE shakes her head again. SUE goes back to BILL who 
               has been watching carefully at a distance. After a moment, 
               they turn back and walk home. ROGER sees another newcomer 
               approaching. He calls out.

                                     ROGER
                         Hey, Terry. Pauline's mum got killed 
                         last night.

                                     TERRY
                         She never.

                                     ROGER
                         She did too.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               BILL and SUE enter, bursting with their news. GRACE'S 
               sister, HOPE, has come to help and so have MOLLY and MAC, 
               and a Neighbour, MRS. EVANS, on whom DAWN wished a bomb.  
               GRACE'S arm is bandaged, MAC is scoring panes of glass 
               with a diamond cutter. He has a dollop of putty. BILL is 
               immediately distracted and cannot resist kneading the putty. 
               DAWN brings in a tray of tea. They are all in high spirits, 
               almost festive. SUE tugs at her mother's skirt.

                                     SUE
                         Pauline's mummy got deaded.

               GRACE'S attention is elsewhere. She does not hear.

                                     MOLLY
                         You're lucky up here. The East 
                         End's been burning for three nights. 
                         Incendiaries.

               DAWN hands the neighbour her tea.

                                     DAWN
                         Still not been hit, Mrs. Evans?

                                     MRS. EVANS
                         Touch wood.

                                     DAWN
                         You had a near-miss the other might.

                                     MRS. EVANS
                         I hear they're dropping diseased 
                         rats on bomb sites.

                                     DAWN
                         BILL found this tiny little 
                         parachute. So that's what it was 
                         for.

               They all slurp their tea and talk at once. HOPE is dusting 
               the piano.

                                     HOPE
                         Is the piano all right, Grace? It 
                         was knocked clean over.

               GRACE goes over to it and opens the lid, runs her fingers 
               over the keys.

                                     GRACE
                         It seems to have survived.

                                     MAC
                         Play something, Grace.

                                     MOLLY
                         We never used to sing much before 
                         the war, did we? Not in daytime 
                         anyway.

               DAWN starts to sing 'Mareseatoats and Doeseaboats and 
               Littleambseativy' and GRACE picks it up on the piano. DAWN 
               dances around the room. There is something wild and 
               abandoned about her.

                                     MRS. EVANS
                         Dawn's come on fast.

                                     MOLLY
                         That's the war for you. Quick, 
                         quick, quick.

                                     MRS. EVANS
                         Didn't I see you with a soldier, 
                         Dawn?

               It is just a teasing guess. She roars with laughter.

                                     DAWN
                         I'm just doing my bit for the war 
                         effort.

               GRACE stops playing.

                                     GRACE
                         I won't have this vulgar talk in 
                         my house.

                                     DAWN
                         It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm 
                         fifteen. I'm still at school. I 
                         want to be a nun when I grow up.

               MAC goes over to GRACE. He picks up some sheet music from 
               a pile scattered on the floor. He selects a piece and props 
               it on the music stand.

                                     MAC
                         Try and few bars of old Fred, Grace.

               GRACE is softened by his tone. Their eyes meet for a moment. 
               She turns the stool back to the keyboard and plays Chopin, 
               particularly poignant since the fall of Warsaw.  They listen 
               with teary eyes. 'Mareseatoats and Doeseaboats and Chopin. 
               It is the spirit of the Blitz.

                                     SUE
                              (whispering to Bill)
                         Tell them about Pauline's mum.

                                     BILL
                         Not now. They wouldn't believe me.

               STOCK FILM

               BLACK AND WHITE

               The Chopin continues over a scenes of bomb-ruined London, 
               desolate and devastated.

               EXT. BOMBED SITE - EVENING

               COLOUR

               A surreal landscape: a flight of stairs leading nowhere, 
               an exposed bathroom; a house entirely destroyed but for 
               one fragment of wall jutting up, and on it still hangs a 
               picture. BILL wanders among these wonders, scavenging. A 
               marauding gang of boys approaches. They spread out and 
               move up on BILL from all sides, trapping him. ROGER, the 
               boy who told of Pauline's mother's death, is among them 
               and appears to be their leader.

                                     ROGER
                         What are you doing here? This is 
                         our territory

                                     BILL
                         Looking for shrapnel.

                                     A BOY
                         What you got?

               Two of them grab BILL and wrench his fist open, extracting 
               a piece of metal.

                                     A BOY
                         Look, a detonator.

               The others gather round, scrapping and shoving for a better 
               look, BILL'S arms are twisted behind his back and his eyes 
               are covered with a very dirty handkerchief. They take him 
               to a ruined house.

               INT. RUINED HOUSE - DAY

               The room has a brazier, table and chairs. They remove the 
               blindfold and he sees a wondrous sight, a collection of 
               bullets, shells and bomb fragments. ROGER slaps the shell 
               proudly.

                                     ROGER
                         Unexploded.

                                     BOY
                         You were spying.

                                     BILL
                         I never was.

                                     ROGER
                         Yes, you was. Make him talk.

               They twist his arm. Several of the boys are smoking. One 
               takes a .303 Bullet and tightens in into an old vice fixed 
               to the table. BILL is fighting back the tears. ROGER leans 
               over BILL.

                                     BILL
                         I know a secret.

                                     ROGER
                         What's that?

                                     BILL
                         The Germans are dropping men on 
                         bomb sites.

                                     ROGER
                         Who told you that?

               They loosen their grip on his arm.

                                     BILL
                         My uncle's in the War Office. He 
                         said, Don't go on the bomb sites. 
                         "Boys are going missing all the 
                         time."

                                     ROGER
                         They're not.

               BILL has captured their attention. They release him.

                                     BILL
                         If you find them hiding, they cut 
                         your throat. They have to, or they'd 
                         get found out.

               The boys begin to get nervous, glancing about them. The 
               BOY on the vice aims a nail at the top of the bullet, 
               brandishing a hammer in the other hand.

                                     BOY
                         I wish one would come through the 
                         door now.

               He hammers the nail and the bullet EXPLODES, embedding 
               itself in the door. They jump out of their skins.

                                     ROGER
                         You want to join our gang?

                                     BILL
                         I don't mind.

                                     ROGER
                         Do you know any swear words?

                                     BILL
                         Yes.

                                     ROGER
                         Say them.

               BILL is stubbornly silent.

                                     ROGER
                         Well go on then. You can't join if 
                         you can't answer.

                                     BILL
                         I only know one.

               They laugh derisively.

                                     ROGER
                         Well say that one then.

               BILL cannot get himself to say it, try as he will. They 
               groan and jeer. BILL forces it out, the one that he heard 
               on the bomb site.

                                     BILL
                         Fuck!

               They fall respectfully silent, exchange covert looks.

                                     ROGER
                         That word is special. That word is 
                         only for something really important. 
                         Now, repeat after me... Bugger 
                         off.

                                     BILL
                         Bugger off.

                                     ROGER
                         Sod.

                                     BILL
                         Sod.

                                     ROGER
                         Bloody.

                                     BILL
                         Bloody.

                                     ROGER
                         Now put them together. Bugger off, 
                         you bloody sod.

                                     BILL
                         Bugger off, you bloody sod.

                                     ROGER
                         OK. You're in.

               He gets up, leading them out of the room.

                                     ROGER
                         Let's smash things up.

               They go into a newly bombed house and, armed with stout 
               sticks and iron bars, indulge in an orgy of destruction.  
               ROGER has an air-gun and specializes in picking of light 
               bulbs. BILL is tentative at first, but the violence is 
               infectious. Pent-up aggression bursts and his is wilder 
               and worse than the others.

               EXT. BUILDER'S YARD - DAY

               ROGER leads the way, clambering over a damaged wall and 
               dropping into an enclosed yard. The others tumble after 
               him and ROGER raises a warning arm and addresses the gang 
               solemnly.

                                     ROGER
                         This is top secret.

               He points to a corner where dozens of sign-posts, uprooted 
               from crossroads, have been piled against each other, their 
               arms spread out forlonly announcing the names of towns and 
               their distances.

                                     ROGER
                         They pulled them up from all the 
                         crossroads, so when the Germans 
                         land they'll lose their way.

                                     BILL
                         Won't they have maps?

                                     ROGER
                         They'll have to go to a shop to 
                         buy a map, stupid. Then they'll 
                         give zemselves avay viz ze vay zay 
                         tork.

               One BOY starts to goose-step and sing.

                                     BOY
                              (singing)
                         Ven der Fuhrer says Vis iss der 
                         master race, Ve vart, vart, vart, 
                         Right in der Fuhrer's face.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - LANDING AD STAIRS - NIGHT

               DAWN, watched by BILL, tiptoes down the stairs. She opens 
               the front door as silently as possible. Vera Lynn dispenses 
               sexy sentimentality on the wireless ('Sincerely Yours').  
               GRACE appears. DAWN is caught in the act.

                                     GRACE
                         And where do you think you're going?

                                     DAWN
                         Out.

                                     GRACE
                         You go to bed this minute and take 
                         off that lipstick.

                                     DAWN
                         No, I won't.

               GRACE files at her, enraged, and slaps her head and face.

                                     GRACE
                         You wouldn't dare defy me if your 
                         father was here.

               DAWN covers her head with her arms until GRACE stops, 
               exhausted.

                                     DAWN
                         If you've finished, I'm going.

               She steps out of the door. GRACE grabs her, tearing her 
               blouse, and swings her back inside. They wrestle wildly, 
               both whimpering and moaning. BILL watches from above as 
               the fight imperceptibly transforms and mother and daughter 
               are finally hugging each other and crying.

                                     DAWN
                         I want him. I want him so much.  
                         I'll kill myself if I can't have 
                         him.

                                     GRACE
                         There, there, my baby.

               GRACE lets go and turns towards the living room where Vera 
               Lynn wails a lament.

                                     GRACE
                         Go if you want. What does it matter? 
                         We might be all dead tomorrow.

               DAWN'S make-up is smudged, her clothes torn.

                                     DAWN
                         I can't go like this.

               GRACE turns back and takes DAWN'S hand.

                                     GRACE
                         You better bring him home, if you 
                         really love him. Don't kill love.  
                         You'll regret it for the rest of 
                         your life.

                                     DAWN
                         Who said anything about love?

               EXT. BOMBED SITE - EVENING

               The gang's H.Q. is even further improved. They have put in 
               some expensive furniture.  They have a wireless and a 
               cocktail bar that opens to reveal a nest of mirrors 
               reflecting the bottles within. The gang fool's around, in 
               and out of the room, smoking and drinking beer. A girl 
               walks past, throwing them a flirtatious look. It is PAULINE 
               the girl who lost her mother in an air-raid. They whistle 
               and shout at her.

                                     BOY #1
                         Want to see our den?

                                     BOY #2
                         We got a bed.

               They laugh bawdily and she turns up her nose. One of the 
               boys starts to wrestle with her. She starts to struggle. 
               They pin back her arms and try and kiss her. Her breasts 
               push up against her blouse like little apples. ROGER 
               whispers something in her ear. She protests.

                                     ROGER
                         Go on, Pauline. Be a sport.

                                     PAULINE
                         No, I won't. There's too many of 
                         you.

                                     ROGER
                         One at a time.

                                     PAULINE
                         No, I won't.

                                     ROGER
                         I'll give you something.

               He gets a box, opens it and shows it her. It is full of 
               looted jewelry, brooches, cheap bracelets. PAULINE is 
               delighted. She pokes around and chooses a necklace, puts 
               it on.

                                     PAULINE
                         All right. Line up.

               They form a n orderly queue and PAULINE pulls up her skirt.  
               She holds her knickers open by the elastic so that it is 
               possible to look inside. The boys file past, each peering 
               inside her knickers for a second or two.

                                     BOY 2
                         I seen better.

               BILL is on the end. As his turn approaches, his face is 
               tense with apprehension.

                                     PAULINE
                         It won't bite you.

               They all laugh at his expense. Hi swings punches, flying 
               in all directions and they hits back. One or two land. 
               They hurt the recipients and they hit back. ROGER calls a 
               halt.

                                     ROGER
                         Pack it in. It's time to smash 
                         things up.

               EXT. ANOTHER BOMBED SITE - EVENING

               The gang loot and pillage, smashing as they go. Behind a 
               piece of broken wall, BILL discovers a soldier and a girl 
               clasped together, the girl is pressed against a door. BILL 
               moves closer. The soldier fumbles with her clothing, but 
               she is so wild with passion that his efforts are impeded. 
               BILL registers the familiar gasps and cries that he is 
               becoming accustomed to hearing from the injured, the dying 
               and the coupling. The girl moves her head and her face 
               becomes visible over the soldier's shoulder. It is DAWN. 
               She sees BILL as he sees her. She mouths the words: 'Go 
               away'. He turns to shake and cry. He moves away, then on 
               an angry impulse picks up a stone and throws it. The soldier 
               lets out a cry. He turns revealing himself as BRUCE.

                                     BILL
                              (shouting)
                         Fuck!

               Hearing the sacred cry, the gang come running. They see 
               BILL hurling stones and quickly join in. BRUCE protests 
               angrily and throws a couple of rocks himself, but he is 
               overwhelmed.  He protects DAWN from the onslaught and they 
               flee.

                                     ROGER
                         Teach him a lesson. Think they can 
                         come over here and take our women.

                                     BOY 2
                         Wasn't that your sister, Rohan?

               BILL shakes his head, denying her.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               GRACE is cutting down a coat for SUE; BILL is reading a 
               comic, the Dandy; DAWN is darning stockings. The doorbell 
               SOUNDS and DAWN catapults from her chair to greet the 
               visitor. She returns with BRUCE, now evidently a welcome 
               and regular guest.

               BILL throws friendly punches, one wild one catches him in 
               the crotch. He takes it bravely. He distributes largesse, 
               a tin of corned beef and a packet of tea for GRACE, chewing 
               gum for SUE, a model barrage balloon for BILL and a pair 
               of nylons for DAWN.

                                     BRUCE
                         You need suspenders for this kind.

               She laughs, then holds the stockings against her skin in a 
               transport of sexual delight.

                                     DAWN
                         I'm going to cross my legs and 
                         make that rustling noise.

               Finally and dramatically, BRUCE pulls out a package in a 
               brown-paper bag. He gives it to GRACE. She opens it. It is 
               a piece of beef steak. GRACE is overcome.

                                     GRACE
                         Steak! I can't remember the last 
                         time...

                                     BRUCE
                         crooning ironically 'The last time 
                         I saw sirloin...'

               GRACE holds the raw meat in her two hands and impulsively 
               kisses it.

                                     BRUCE
                         Take it away. I know your husband's 
                         been away a long time, but....

                                     DAWN
                         Don't be so cheeky, Bruce.

               He holds up his hands in supplication.

                                     BRUCE
                         Sorry, sorry. Too long in the 
                         barrack room.

               Itma has just ended and a programme has started up about 
               the evacuation of Dunkirk. Its tone is quasi-religious - 
               patriotic as it tells of the armada of little boats 
               heroically snatching the remnants of the British Army out 
               of the jaws of the Nazis. Churchill's voice booms out of 
               the wireless.

                                     CHURCHILL (V.O.)
                         If the British Empire lasts for a 
                         thousand years, men will say, this 
                         was their finest hour.

               BRUCE has been horsing around with BILL, and all the time 
               DAWN devours him with her eyes.

                                     GRACE
                         Oh, do let's listen to this. I 
                         never tire of listening to it. I 
                         gives me goose pimples.

                                     BRUCE
                         You haven't been taking your orange 
                         juice.

               The insolent sally gives DAWN the excuse to jump on him 
               and force him on to the sofa and into a respectful silence.  
               Stirring music punctuates the dramatic narration, which 
               celebrates the bravery of the soldiers fighting their last 
               ditch stand. BRUCE giggles.

                                     BRUCE
                         Don't sound the Dunkirk I was at. 
                         I saw no fighting. We did a lot of 
                         running backwards, though. Then we 
                         got to the beach and we couldn't 
                         run no more. And Jerry just sat 
                         there and let us alone. If he'd 
                         come after us, boy shakes his head 
                         and laughs as though it would have 
                         been the funniest moment of the 
                         war.

               We were beat so bad, discipline was all to Hell. We told 
               the soldiers to jump in the briny. There was no grub but 
               we broke into the wine stores, and everybody got smashed. 
               When the boats came, a lot of guys threw away their gear 
               and filled their kitbags with loot. One buddy of mine burst 
               into a jeweler's, his backpack was full of gold and silver. 
               We had to wade out to the boats and he was so heavy he 
               couldn't haul himself up. He slipped and sank like a stone.

               He laughs again. The broadcast comes to its moving climax.

                                     GRACE
                         How can you say such things? Can't 
                         you hear what happened?

                                     BRUCE
                         I was there.

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         God laid his hand upon the waters 
                         and they were still. The armada of 
                         little boats brought their precious 
                         cargo into safe havens. They lived 
                         to fight another day.

                         He who turns and runs away lives 
                         to fight another day.

               The inspiring, patriotic music, Elgar, wells up.

                                     GRACE
                         I don't care what you say. It filled 
                         our hearts that day. The little 
                         people stood up for once against 
                         the tyrant. Stood up and said no!

               BRUCE impressed, despite himself. DAWN is quite affected 
               too, by her mother's deep feeling.

                                     GRACE
                         That's how we put up with the 
                         bombing and the rationing, because 
                         of Dunkirk. Because of the spirit 
                         of Dunkirk, and because of that we 
                         shall never give in, never.

               THE ELGAR CONTINUES INTO:

               NEWSREEL

               BACK AND WHITE

               A shot of troops being ferried from Dunkirk beaches by the 
               little boats. An open fishing boat is packed with soldiers, 
               mostly standing, while two men row. The soldiers begin to 
               sway and 'la-la' to the Elgar soundtrack. They are serious 
               and sombre, except for one, BRUCE, who is grinning.

                                                              SMASH CUT:

               Back to BRUCE singing and smiling.

               EXT. ROSEHILL AVENUE - DAY

               CLIVE, leather helmet and goggles iced up, rides to the 
               Rohan House on a Norton motorbike. The street is snow-
               covered and the road is covered in brown slush. BILL and 
               SUE run out to greet him. He dismounts painfully, his huge 
               army greatcoat is also rimmed with frost. His face is so 
               stiff with cold that he cannot crack a smile and presents 
               an intimidating figure to the children, who draw up  short. 
               When he speaks, he can hardly form words. He staggers 
               alarmingly from the stiffness as he walks, and cramp in 
               one leg makes him hop up and down.

                                     CLIVE
                         On the bike for five hours. Only 
                         got a thirty-six hour pass.

               He holds out his arms. They cower back, then turn on their 
               heels and scurry into the house,  calling their mother.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               CLIVE has changed into civvies and is soaking his feet in 
               a bowl of hot water. Tea has been laid and the family 
               assembled. They watch CLIVE warily. They have learned to 
               live without him and his reappearance has upset the new 
               ballance.

                                     CLIVE
                         Hand me my backpack, Bill.

               BILL hands it to him and CLIVE proudly pulls out an un 
               labelled can and plants it firmly on the centre of tea 
               table.

                                     GRACE
                         And what's that?

                                     CLIVE
                         Jam.

               BILL and SUE jump for joy.

                                     BILL AND SUE
                              (chanting)
                         Jam! Jam! Jam!

                                     GRACE
                         Jam? What kind of jam? It's not 
                         like any jam I know.

                                     CLIVE
                         German jam. It's German jam.

               The table falls deathly silent. They stare at the can as 
               though it was a time bomb.

                                     CLIVE
                         It's all right. It came from a 
                         German chip. It got sunk, and this 
                         stuff washed ashore, crates of it.  
                         Jam. Our fellows found it on the 
                         beach, by the rifle range.

               GRACE picks it up gingerly, turns it, searches the blank 
               silver-grey metal for a sign, a clue, a portent.

                                     GRACE
                         We don't know anything about it

                                     CLIVE
                         Well, it's off ration. We know 
                         that.

                                     GRACE
                         How do we know they didn't plant 
                         it there? They know we're mad on 
                         jam.  They could poison half the 
                         country.

               CLIVE surveys the suspicious hostile faces. Angrily, he 
               seizes the can and jabs it clumsily with the paper opener.

                                     GRACE
                         Come away, children. I don't want 
                         you to stand too close while he's 
                         opening it.

               They retreat to the corner of the room. CLIVE has it opened 
               and bends back the top to reveal a deep-red jam. GRACE 
               ventures forward and peers at it.

                                     CLIVE
                         Well?

                                     GRACE
                         It looks....foreign.

                                     CLIVE
                         Jam is jam! It's just jam!

                                     DAWN
                         Well, I'm not having any. Even if 
                         it's not poisoned. I don't think 
                         it's right. It's not patriotic.

                                     BILL
                         You don't like jam. You hate jam.  
                         You never eat jam.

                                     DAWN
                         That's not the point.

               There is an impasse. They stare at it gloomily. CLIVE waves 
               grandly at the jam.

                                     CLIVE
                         Taste it. Why don't you taste it?

                                     GRACE
                         You taste it.

               The eyes turn on CLIVE. The situation forces their 
               resentment for one who has not shared in their hardships, 
               who abandoned them, in fact. The jam has become a test. He 
               looks into the faces of his family. Resolutely, he takes 
               up a teaspoon, picks up the can and begins to eat. Grimly 
               and steadily he ladles the jam to his mouth. They watch 
               him carefully for signs of pain. Before their doubts are 
               dispelled, he has consumed a third of the can. BILL is the 
               first to crack.

                                     BILL
                         Give us some, Dad.

               CLIVE stops eating, puts the can back on the table and 
               they all dig in. The tension is dispelled. SUE climbs on 
               CLIVE'S lap and he feeds her himself. They laugh and chatter 
               and stuff bread and jam in their mouths.

                                     GRACE
                         You mean they let you go through 
                         the officer training course and 
                         then said you were too old for a 
                         commission?

                                     CLIVE
                         That's it.

                                     GRACE
                         Why didn't they say that before 
                         you started?

                                     CLIVE
                         I wasn't too old when I started 
                         the course. I was too old when it 
                         finished.

                                     GRACE
                         What are you going to be then?

                                     CLIVE
                         A clerk. I'm doing a typing course.  
                         I'll be typing for England.

               GRACE goes to him, puts an arm around him.

                                     GRACE
                         Poor Clive. You wanted it so much.

               He looks up at her, beaten, uncomprehending. She kisses 
               him.

                                     GRACE
                         You're such a baby.

               The DOORBELL SOUNDS. DAWN scoots out to answer it.

                                     BILL
                         It's lovely jam. It's nearly as 
                         nice as English jam.

               CLIVE grins, quickly recovered from his bad moment.

                                     CLIVE
                         You know what I always say? Jam is 
                         jam, the world over.

               DAWN reappears with BRUCE. CLIVE darts a querying look at 
               GRACE. He winces at the sight of his little girl looking 
               up adoringly at a Canadian soldier.

                                     DAWN
                         Bruce, this is my father. Dad, 
                         this is Corporal Bruce Carey.

               CLIVE laughs awkwardly, outranked.

                                     BILL
                         Bruce, look! Dad got some German 
                         jam.

                                     SUE
                         We thought it was poison.

               They laugh. BRUCE looks at it with mock suspicion, then 
               tastes it with his fingertip. His eyes bulge and he clutches 
               his throat.

                                     BRUCE
                         The poison was at the bottom.

               He falls to the ground in the most agonized convulsions. 
               The children scream with laughter and jump on top of him.

               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - KITCHEN STEPS - DAY

               The kitchen door is open, admitting thin winter sunlight.  
               GRACE works within. Outside, CLIVE is cleaning his kit, 
               helped by BILL. Belt and gaiters are balanced and laid out 
               to dry. CLIVE is sitting on the steps, putting dubbin on 
               his boots,  BILL polishing his father's hat badge, totally 
               absorbed in its beauty. GRACE appears, outs a hand on 
               CLIVE'S shoulder, closes her eyes, let's the sun caress 
               her face.

                                     GRACE
                         When do you think you'll get leave 
                         again?

                                     CLIVE
                         Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.

               SUE appears and sprawls herself across her father's lap.

                                     CLIVE
                         I'm glad you didn't send them to 
                         your aunt.

                                     GRACE
                         I've had a letter from her. They've 
                         moved house.

                                     CLIVE
                         Where to?

               She smiles, eyes still closed.

                                     GRACE
                         Woolamaloo.

               CLIVE splutters with amusement.

                                     CLIVE
                         Not Woolamaloo?

               BILL looks up, grinning.

                                     BILL
                         Woolamaloo? We would have lived in 
                         Woolamaloo?

               CLIVE starts to sing the old music-hall song.

                                     CLIVE
                              (singing)
                         W-O-O-L-A-M-A-L-O-O, oo.  Upon my 
                         word, it's true.  It's the way to 
                         spell Woolamaloo.

               They join in, in a ragged way, knowing it well.

                                     EVERYBODY
                              (singing)
                         I bet you a dollar, There isn't a 
                         scholar, To spell it right first 
                         go, O, W-O-O-L-A-M-A-L-O-O, Loo-O 
                         DAWN comes through the kitchen 
                         with MAC and MOLLY, who find the 
                         Rohans in good spirits. There are 
                         arm greetings all round.

               EXT. ROSEHILL AVENUE - DAY

               BILL is giving his father and MAC a tour of the bomb damage.  
               He picks his way expertly through the rubble, and they 
               clamber after him.

                                     CLIVE
                         What kind of war is this Mac?  Up 
                         there in Cumberland, we never see 
                         an air-raid. The worst problem I 
                         have is getting a new typewriter 
                         ribbon. When I rode in against the 
                         Turks, I knew what it was about.

                         Did you? You thought you did. We've 
                         been gypsed, all our lives. Look 
                         at your street.

               They pause, looking out of a shattered window on the street.  
               It is a monotonous row of semi-detached houses, lying 
               between other identical rows, now pocked with bomb damage, 
               drab and dreary.

                         Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill.  
                         And it's certainly not an avenue.

                                     CLIVE
                         Why not?

                                     MAC
                         You need trees for an avenue.

                         There was talk of planting some 
                         when we first came.

                         Propaganda. We've been had.

               They fall silent, watching BILL as he greets some other 
               boys.

                                     CLIVE
                         How's your war, Mac?

                         Never done better. On the fiddle.  
                         Like everyone else.

                         I don't understand. Is there any 
                         point to it?

                                     MAC
                         There is all right. This Hitter 
                         fellow. We've got to winkle him 
                         out. And get shot of some of our 
                         lot at the same time.

               They watch BILL rooting about in the rubble.

                                     CLIVE
                         Look at how wild the boy's got. As 
                         for Dawn. Sixteen, going around 
                         with a soldier.
                              (shakes his head)
                         Keep and eye on them for me, Mac, 
                         there's a pal. I've made a mess of 
                         it all.
                              (his voices cracks. 
                              A sob wells up.)
                         I've been such a bloody fool.

               BILL has come up behind them and watches covertly. MAC 
               clasps CLIVE in his arms.

                                     MAC
                         You always were, Clive. Steady the 
                         Buffs.

                                     CLIVE
                         Bugger the Buffs.

               Cries and shouts come from the street. BILL swings across 
               a crater on a dangling electric cable and scrambles into 
               the road. There is panic and pandemonium. The local barrage 
               balloon's fins have punctured and it has lost stability.  
               It is careering wildly like a kite out of control. CLIVE 
               and MAC clamber into the street as the balloon skims across 
               the sky, its steel cable shearing a chimney stack which 
               tumbles down onto the front garden sending people scattering 
               in all directions. BILL runs up,  mad with excitement, as 
               SUE and DAWN come out of the house with GRACE and MOLLY 
               and look up.  CLIVE sprints across to them.

                                     CLIVE
                         Take cover! We're being attacked 
                         by our own balloons!

               They take no notice of his entreaty, curiosity getting the 
               better of them.

                                     MOLLY
                         It's having a nervous breakdown.

               She giggles. The balloon bumps on the rooftop then shoots 
               up into the sky again. GRACE starts to laugh.

                                     GRACE
                         It's so wonderful.

               CLIVE earnestly dashes back and forth, wanting to do 
               something, but completely unable to decide what.

                                     CLIVE
                         Don't panic!
                              (goes over to Mac)
                         Keep your head!

                                     MAC
                         I will if you will!

               The balloon does a fat little waltz in the sky. CLIVE 
               suddenly explodes with laughter. DAWN has SUE in her arms.

                                     DAWN
                         He just got fed up with all the 
                         other boring old barrage balloons 
                         and decided it was time to have 
                         some fun.

               Two ARP MEN run down the street, urging people to go inside.  
               The family retreat grudgingly towards their house, but 
               hover in the front garden watching and laughing. Six HOME 
               GUARDS march into Rosehill Avenue at the double. The balloon 
               has risen into the sky and the people are drawn out again 
               into the street, looking up. The HOME GUARDS come to a 
               halt and raise their rifles.

                                     BILL
                         Boo! Leave it alone!

               The balloon suddenly plunges down towards the street, 
               scattering the HOME GUARDS. Women SCREAM and everyone dashes 
               for cover again. BILL laughs derisively.

                                     BILL
                         They're scared of old fatty.

               The GUARDS form up again and fire at the balloon. It bursts 
               into flames. The shreds of burning cloth, followed by the 
               spiralling cable, plunges into the street. There are cries 
               if regret and the family and others step forward to inspect 
               the smouldering remains with the same sadness that is felt 
               at the end of a firework display.

                                     BILL
                         Why did they have to go and do 
                         that?

               INT. W.V.S CENTRE - DAY

               A make-do-and-mend session, where clothes are exchanged, 
               repaired, altered and cut down. It is swarming with women 
               and children. MOLLY and GRACE rummage among the racks of 
               clothing. SUE and BILL, bored and resigned, are obliged to 
               try on items of used clothing.

                                     MOLLY
                         God, how I hate all this scrimping 
                         and squalor.

                                     GRACE
                         I don't mind it. It was harder 
                         before the war. Trying to keep up 
                         appearances. Now it's patriotic to 
                         be poor.

               In the absence of men, women are everywhere stripping down 
               to their underwear to try on the clothes. BILL tries not 
               to watch, acutely embarrassed.

                                     MOLLY
                         I don't know how you cope, Grace.  
                         Three kids, army pay. On your own.

                                     GRACE
                         You know something, Molly? I like 
                         it on my own. I never got used to 
                         sharing a bed, not really.

               MOLLY pulls of her dress and suddenly, inches from BILL'S 
               face, are those mysterious few inches of white suspendered 
               leg between the stocking-tops and the camiknickers.

                                     MOLLY
                         I love a man in bed, the smell of 
                         him, the hairiness rubbing against 
                         you, the weight of him. And when 
                         they do it to you in the middle of 
                         the night and you don't know if 
                         you're dreaming or it's really 
                         happening to you. That's the best.  
                         No guilty feelings. Not that I 
                         should have any, wide awake.

               MOLLY pulls on a flowered silk dress that clings to her 
               figure. She smooths it out.

                                     GRACE
                         Molly!

                                     MOLLY
                         Well! I'm not talking about Mac. 
                         He hasn't toughed me for ages. And 
                         not often ever. My life started 
                         when Mac went on nights.

               She dissolves in a fit of giggles. GRACE helps SUE with a 
               sensible navy-blue coat. It is heavy and dull. SUE doesn't 
               like it. Her face creases and tears well up.

                                     GRACE
                         You're having me on, Molly.

                                     MOLLY
                         Am I? Maybe I am.

                                     GRACE
                         You've been drinking. Your tipsy.

                                     MOLLY
                         Tipsy, topsy, turvy.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               BILL and SUE each have a torch, which serve as a 
               searchlight.  BILL smokes a woodbine and he blows the smoke 
               around the suspended model aircraft.  Spitfires, Hurricanes, 
               Messerschmitts, Heinkels are picked out in turn. As they 
               appear,BILL simulates their engine noise. With considerable 
               dexterity, he uses his free hand to fire his ack-ack guns, 
               and papier-mache pellets, pre-soaked in ink, fly through 
               the air. BILL animates a distressed plane plummeting to 
               earth. His triumph is interrupted by a TAP at the window. 
               Expertly he dogs his Woodbine then goes to the window. He 
               opens it and DAWN steps through. He is about to close it 
               after her when BRUCE'S face appears. BILL lets fly an ink 
               pellet catching BRUCE square on the forehead. DAWN holds 
               up a threatening hand and the children shrink back as BRUCE 
               clambers in. The two of them tiptoe into the next bedroom, 
               DAWN throwing a warning glance over her shoulder.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - LANDING - NIGHT

               BILL and SUE share the keyhole, which affords a partial 
               view of Dawn's bed. Complicated combinations of limbs cross 
               the field of view, offering a tantalizing version of events 
               within. The children give up and return to their room, 
               whispering.

                                     SUE
                         I suppose they're still learning, 
                         that's why they keep moving about.

                                     BILL
                         It's easy. I've done it.

                                     SUE
                         Who with?

                                     BILL
                         Pauline.

                                     SUE
                         Liar. Mummy keep still and Daddy 
                         moves on top of her. That's what 
                         they do when they know how.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DAWN'S ROOM - NIGHT.

               BRUCE turns on his back with a deep sigh of satisfaction.

                                     BRUCE
                              (whispering)
                         Boy, that was some air-raid.

                                     DAWN
                         Air-raid?

                                     BRUCE
                         Didn't you feel the house rock? 
                         You must have seen all those shell 
                         bursts.

               She sticks the pillow in her mouth to stop laughing. BRUCE 
               turns and whispers in her ear.

                                     BRUCE
                         Let's get married. We'll live in 
                         Montreal. I'll teach you French. 
                         Je t'aime, mon petit chou.

               Even when he's serious, his manner is teasing.

                                     DAWN
                         Don't get smoochy. You'll spoil 
                         it.

               She is genuinely irritated.

               FILM EXTRACT

               BLACK AND WHITE

               A scene from a forties romantic movie. The couple on the 
               screen are deeply in love, but he must go off to the war.  
               Their parting is bitter-sweet, prolonged and accompanied 
               by a symphony orchestra playing its heart out.

               COLOUR

               MAC sits between MOLLY and GRACE. He looks from one to the 
               other. They are both weeping, lost in the movie, and 
               oblivious of him. SUE sleeps, lying across her mother's 
               lap. BILL squirms with embarrassment as the screen lovers 
               kiss. He turns his face away. When he looks back, he is 
               disgusted to see that they are still at it.

               EXT. NATIONAL GALLERY - DAY

               BILL leans over to the balustrade of the pillar portico 
               looking out on to Trafalgar Square. The strains of  a 
               passionate piano recital reverberate from inside the 
               Gallery.  Soldiers and their girls, hand in hand, listen 
               enraptured.

               EXT. TRAFALGAR SQUARE - DAY

               Barrage balloons hang over Admiralty Arch and garland Nelson 
               astride his column.

               EXT. NATIONAL GALLERY - DAY

               BILL threads his way through the crowd, past signs 
               announcing Dame Myra Hess's lunchtime concerts (SOLD OUT) 
               and into the marbled hall.

               INT. NATIONAL GALLERY - DAY

               BILL slides back into his seat next to GRACE as DAME Myra 
               concludes the WARSAW Concerto. The audience rises to its 
               feet, applauding, GRACE, he eyes shining, is among them. 
               MAC watches her pleasure with pleasure.  BILL is disturbed 
               by the music, by the eruption of emotion and some wearing 
               blue uniforms demoting the war wounded. They clap and clap.

                                     GRACE
                         Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't 
                         been to a concert since...

                                     MAC
                         ...since I used to take you to the 
                         Proms?

                                     GRACE
                         That's right. Not since then Not 
                         since I got married.

               Their eyes meet. The audience is drowning in it own 
               applause.  Everyone is crying, or laughing, or both. GRACE 
               and MAC among them. In the emotional tumult they reveal 
               more than they intend. The audience falls silent. BILL'S 
               gaze drifts to the wall where huge paintings by special 
               war artists hang. GRACE tears her eyes away from MAC. She 
               senses BILL watching her and turns her attention to Dame 
               Myra's fingers flying over the keys.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

               The table has been stretched to embrace the Rohan family, 
               including GRACE'S SISTERS. They wear paper hats, have 
               finished their Christmas dinner, and are listening 
               attentively to King George VI stuttering painfully through 
               his Christmas message.

               EXT. ROSEHILL AVENUE - DAY

               It is raining. BRUCE hurries along the street, and as he 
               enters the Rohan's front gate, he pauses, pulls an old 
               silk stocking over his head and takes two glass eyes from 
               his pocket. They look as though they once belonged to a 
               stuffed stag. He pushes them inside the stocking and 
               positions them just under his own eyes so that he can peek 
               over them. He crawls under the bow window.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

               The King falters to a conclusion.

                                     CLIVE
                         He was a lot better this year.

               MAC and the others mumble agreement.

                                     BILL
                         You said that last year, Dad.

                                     CLIVE
                         The land and the King are one, my 
                         son. If he stutters we falter. 
                         He's getting batter, and so are 
                         we.

               The National Anthem strikes up on the wireless. They all 
               rise and stand to attention.

               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - DAY

               BRUCE raises his head and presses his grotesque face to 
               the window. He taps on the glass. He is startled to see 
               the assembled family standing upright and staring back at 
               him without expression. He cavorts and waves his arms, but 
               still gets no response. Sheepishly, he slinks into the 
               porch and pulls off the stocking. The door opens to reveal 
               DAWN.

                                     DAWN
                         Dad's furious. It was 'God Save 
                         The King'.

               He goes inside and she closes the door. He pushes the stag's 
               eyes into his own sockets and scrunches up his face to 
               grip them into place. DAWN turns back and he lunges, trying 
               to kiss her. She squeals wit laughter.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

               A charade is in progress. CLIVE and MAC are got up as 
               prostitutes, wearing their wives'  clothes. GRACE and MOLLY 
               are dressed as men. There is a lot of salacious flirting 
               and an argument breaks out over the price of whores. MOLLY 
               says the word 'tart' emphatically and BILL jumps out of 
               his seat, yelling:

                                     BILL
                         Jam tart! Jam tart! I got it! I 
                         got it!

               The four actors abandon their characterizations and applaud 
               young BILL. BRUCE watches in amazement.

                                     BRUCE
                         Jesus Christ! This is Christmas?

               GRACE'S father rises, his glass held aloft.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         The for my annual toast. Charge 
                         your glasses.

               There are groans and mutterings of disapproval. He cuts an 
               impressive figure,white hair, drooping moustache, waistcoat 
               and watch-chain. His eyes take on a faraway look, sombre 
               and serious. His wife, pointedly leaves the room, slamming 
               the door behind her.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         To Mary McDonald, Thelma Richardson, 
                         Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson...
                              (savours each name, 
                              smiles, shakes his 
                              head, has a special 
                              emphasis or tone 
                              of voice for every 
                              one of them.)
                         ...Little Sarah Whats-it, now there 
                         was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson.

                                     GRACE
                         Father, that's enough now

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         And...and...Henry Chapman's girl, 
                         was it Thelma? No, I can see those 
                         cornflower eyes...I've lost your 
                         name, my sweetness.

               Tears come to his eyes. He falters. There are cries of 
               'shame'. HOPE, GRACE'S sister, jumps to her feet.

                                     HOPE
                         Do we have to listen to this 
                         nonsense every year? You're drunk, 
                         Dadda. Sit down.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         ...Betty Browning...Betty, let me 
                         tell you something. I'm seventy 
                         three years old, I've seen half 
                         the wonders of the world and I 
                         never laid eyes on a finer sight 
                         than the curve of Betty Browning's 
                         breasts...  raises his glass again 
                         My girls Dead you may be, or old 
                         and withered. But while I live, I 
                         will do you honour to the last. 
                         Bless all of you.

               He drinks and slumps down into his chair, overcome with 
               melancholy. Only MOLLY applauds and only DAWN looks 
               sympathetic. BILL taps his grandfather's knee.

                                     BILL
                         It was Sheila, Grandpa.

               GRANDFATHER GEORGE looks up  sadly.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         What's that?

                                     BILL
                         Henry Chapman's daughter. It was 
                         Sheila. I remember her from last 
                         year.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         So it was. Sheila. This boy will 
                         go far.

               BILL turns away to DAWN, stifling his giggles.

                                     BILL
                         I made it up!

               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - NIGHT

               DAWN and BRUCE kiss goodbye in the porch. She pulls away, 
               sensing something amiss.

                                     DAWN
                         What's wrong?

               He looks away, unhappy and awkward.

                                     DAWN
                         What is it?

                                     BRUCE
                         We're not supposed to say, but 
                         we're being shipped out tomorrow.

                                     DAWN
                         Where?

                                     BRUCE
                         I don't know?

                                     DAWN
                         You do, you do. You're just not 
                         saying.

                                     BRUCE
                         I swear I don't know.
                              (offers her a little 
                              box)
                         Here's your Christmas present.

               She opens it. A diamond ring. She gasps, then trusts it 
               back at him angrily.

                                     DAWN
                         You expect me to spend the rest of 
                         the war sitting at home staring at 
                         a ring? And you'll meet some French 
                         girl who can speak your own 
                         language. No thank you!

                                     BRUCE
                         Please yourself.

               BRUCE hurls the little box into the next-door bomb site 
               and storms off into the night. DAWN slams the door.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               DAWN buries her head in a cushion, crying and wailing. 
               Only MAC and MOLLY of the guests remain, and they are 
               playing cards with CLIVE and GRACE. GRACE goes to comfort 
               DAWN.

                                     GRACE
                         What is it, pet?

                                     DAWN
                         He's being posted. I was terrible 
                         to him.

                                     GRACE
                         Don't leave it like that. Go after 
                         him. Swallow your pride.

               EXT. ARMY CAMP - DAY

               CLIVE and DAWN riding pillion, pull up at the Guard House 
               on his old Norton. DAWN slides down and hurries to the 
               Guard House. CLIVE props up the bike and follows her. A 
               convoy of trucks pulls out of the gate. Soldiers lean out 
               of the back of the lorries, cheering and whistling when 
               they see DAWN.

               INT. GUARD HOUSE - DAY

               The SERGEANT of the Guard sits toasting his toes on a coke 
               stove. DAWN addresses CLIVE as he enters.

                                     DAWN
                         We've missed them. They've gone.
                              (turns back to the 
                              Sergeant)
                         Can't you tell me where? You can 
                         see I'm not a spy.

                                     SERGEANT
                         I would if I could, but I can't.

               He points to a  wall on which two posters are pinned. One 
               says 'Careless talk costs lives, the other, ' Walls Have 
               Ears'. DAWN is shattered. CLIVE puts his arm about her.

                                     CLIVE
                         He'll write as soon as he can.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Sure, he will. You'll meet again
                              (sings)
                         don't know where, don't know when.  
                         But in the meantime, I am free 
                         tomorrow night.

               CLIVE leads her out. A sprig of mistletoe hangs over the 
               door. DAWN rips it down and flings it back at the SERGEANT.  
               It hits him square in the face.

               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - PORCH - DAY

               CLIVE is packed up, ready to go. The family has come to 
               bid farewell, all except BILL, who suddenly appears with a 
               triumphant whoop.

                                     BILL
                         I found it! I found it!

               He hands the little ring box to DAWN. She opens it and 
               looks at the ring, but does not put it on her finer. CLIVE 
               and GRACE watch tenderly.

                                     DAWN
                         You needn't have bothered, Bill.

               They watch CLIVE as he rides away. Behind them, the 
               Christmas tree can be seen in the window. As they turn to 
               go in, GRACE looks warily at DAWN.

                                     GRACE
                         That letter this morning, was it 
                         from Bruce?

               DAWN nods.

                                     GRACE
                         What did he say?

                                     DAWN
                         He said I was right. I shouldn't 
                         wait for him. I was better to make 
                         a clean break.

                                     GRACE
                         I think it's very sensible in the 
                         circumstances.

                                     DAWN
                         Now he's gone and made me fall in 
                         love with him, which I never wanted 
                         to do. I told him that.

               She runs into the house and up the stairs.

               EXT. SEASIDE RESORT - DAY

               GRACE, MAC, BILL and SUE are finishing a frugal picnic on 
               the beach. They are muffled up against the nip of early 
               spring.  The sand is criss-crossed with pointed iron spikes 
               and coils of barbed wire. Curt signs warn against mines 
               and other hazards. BILL and SUE start to play happily and 
               messily in the sand. In the distance, they hear MUFFLED, 
               deep-throated EXPLOSIONS.

                                     BILL
                         What's that?

                                     MAC
                         Big Berthas, shelling France.  
                         Twenty-five-mile range, they have.

                                     BILL
                         Wow!

                                     MAC
                         They send over a few every day, to 
                         let them know we're still here.  
                         Each shell costs as much as a Ford 
                         8.

                                     BILL
                         Who pays for them?

                                     MAC
                         We will, you will, for the rest of 
                         our lives?

               BILL gets out a rubber ball, and spins it in is fingers.

                                     GRACE
                         Remember this beach, Mac? All those 
                         summers. Out two families, together.

                                     MAC
                         Happy days.
                              (watches Bill's 
                              efforts with the 
                              ball)
                         When you're bigger, Bill, I'll 
                         teach you the googly.

               BILL smiles a secret smile.

                                     BILL
                         Thanks.

               GRACE starts to sing.

                                     GRACE
                              (singing)
                         There'll be blue birds over, The 
                         white cliffs of Dover...

               MAC and the children join in. BILL practices his spin, 
               finger and wrist.

                                     ALL
                              (singing)
                         ...tomorrow.  Just you wait and 
                         see...

               Another CRUMP from Big Bertha.

                                     BILL
                         There goes another Ford 8, Uncle 
                         Mac.

               EXT. RAILWAY - NIGHT

               The train is unlit to comply with the blackout, the only 
               illumination being as the fire-box door of the loco opened.

               INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

               Moonlight flickers intermittently into the compartment, 
               lending a jerky, monochrome quality to the scene. SUE 
               sleeps, thumb in mouth. BILL dozes in the corner of the 
               compartment.  GRACE and MAC sit side by side.

                                     GRACE
                              (softly)
                         Mac, did you ever find out who 
                         Molly went off with?

                                     MAC
                         A Polish pilot. It's like one of 
                         those jokes on the wireless.

               He stares out of the window, the pale broken light making 
               patterns on his face.

                                     GRACE
                         You miss her. I know you do.

               He smiles ruefully.

                                     MAC
                         She said, 'I know you love me, 
                         Mac, but you've never loved me 
                         enough.'

                                     GRACE
                         Not loving enough. That is a 
                         terrible thing to do to someone. I 
                         suppose I did it to Clive. Always 
                         held something back.

               BILL stirs and fidgets, half hearing, squinting through 
               drooping lids. MAC and GRACE lower their voices further 
               whispering.

                                     MAC
                         It's all better left unsaid, Grace.

                                     GRACE
                         You were never apart, you and Clive. 
                         He kept asking and asking.  And I 
                         waited and waited for you to say 
                         something. And you never did.

                                     MAC
                         Clive had a job. I didn't. I 
                         couldn't.

               They fall silent. GRACE smiles ruefully.

                                     GRACE
                         He could always make me laugh.

                                     MAC
                         We did the decent thing.

                                     GRACE
                         This war's put an end to decent 
                         things. I want to close my eyes 
                         and jump and give myself for once, 
                         hold nothing back.

                                     MAC
                         We can't change what's past. Not 
                         even the war can do that.

                                     GRACE
                         We did all the proper things, and 
                         we lost love. That's sad, Mac.

               Their eyes meet and acknowledge what might have been, of 
               happiness accidentally missed.

                                     GRACE
                         If I saw this at the pictures, I'd 
                         be crying my eyes out, but I can't 
                         shed a tear for myself.

               In the pale half-light, they seem young and innocent. He 
               takes her hand. They almost kiss. But for children, they 
               would. Finally, MAC turns away and looks out at the dark, 
               heavy shapes of the approaching city.

               EXT. ROSEHILL AVENUE - NIGHT

               As GRACE, MAC, BILL and SUE turn into the avenue, they see 
               a house burning. It is theirs. When they get closer, they 
               see it is gutted and the roof has collapsed. The firemen 
               have hoses trained on it, but it is too hot to get into 
               the front door. GRACE'S first thought is for her Daughter.

                                     GRACE
                         Dawn! Dawn!

               DAWN is with a knot of neighbours, watching the blaze. 
               GRACE is so relieved to see her that she smiles and becomes 
               quite tranquil.

                                     GRACE
                         Thank God you're safe.

               The FIRECHIEF approaches her.

                                     FIRECHIEF
                         Was this your house, madam?

                                     GRACE
                         I didn't know there was a raid.

                                     FIRECHIEF
                         It wasn't a bomb, just afire.

                                     GRACE
                         What do you mean, a fire?

                                     FIRECHIEF
                         It happens in wartime as well, you 
                         know.

               MAC is shattered. He puts an arm round GRACE. She throws 
               him a look, haunted with guilt, and she moves away to 
               console her children, who watch the blaze impassively.

                                     DAWN
                         I just wished I'd worn my nylons.

               GRACE suddenly seized by a dread thought. She runs to the 
               FIRECHIEF.

                                     GRACE
                         My ration books are in there.

               She makes a wild dash at the house, but MAC and the 
               neighbours restain her. BILL remains next to the FIRECHIEF.

                                     BILL
                         My shrapnel collection should be 
                         all right.

                                     FIRECHIEF
                         Oh yes, I should think so.

               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - DAY

               Mac's car drives up to the charred ruins of the house. 
               GRACE and the children get out. ROGER and his gang are 
               already looting. BILL charges ROGER and punches him in the 
               face. They fall and roll in the wet ashes. The bigger boy 
               is so taken aback by BILL'S ferocity that he cannot gain 
               an advantage.  MAC stops GRACE from interfering, 
               understanding the boy's need.  PAULINE has appeared and 
               smiles knowingly as she watches.  Other children gather. 
               ROGER picks himself up and the gang beats a retreat.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DAY

               GRACE, MAC, DAWN and SUE join BILL in the house and scratch 
               among the debris to see what can be salvaged.

               EXT. ROSEHILL AVENUE - DAY

               They ferry bit and pieces to the car. GRACE discovers the 
               charred remnants of a photo album. There are pictures with 
               un burnt fragments and she carries it carefully to the 
               car.

                                     GRACE
                         Mac, look! Some of the snaps are 
                         saved.

               It is open at the picture of the two families at the very 
               beach they visited yesterday. It is burned around the edges, 
               only MOLLY and CLIVE are unscathed and they smile happily.  
               GRACE and MAC look at it then at each other. It feeds their 
               guilt. The neighbours gather and awkwardly try to express 
               their sympathy. MRS. EVANS arrives with some clothes.

                                     MRS. EVANS
                         This coat should fit you Grace. 
                         And here are some things for Dawn. 
                         And a few bits for the kitchen.

                                     GRACE
                         Thank you, Evelyne.

               BILL is acutely embarrassed. He catches PAULINE'S smirking 
               look. He fights to hold back the tears, but finally fails.

                                     GRACE
                         It's only a house. We still have 
                         each other.

                                     BILL
                         I don't care about the house, I 
                         just hate all these people watching 
                         us and being nice.

               EXT. THE THAMES RIVERSIDE - DAY

               Carrying GRACE and the three children, MAC's car draws up 
               on the towpath facing an island on which is a number of 
               wooden bungalows with verandas decorated in fretted scroll 
               work.  Neat lawns slope down to the river's edge where 
               varnished punts and skiffs like sleekly tethered. 
               GRANDFATHER GEORGE has spotted them and he rear-sculls his 
               dinghy across the water to fetch them.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Coming. Coming. Deliverance is at 
                         hand. All will be well.

               GRANDMOTHER comes down from the bungalow to the edge of 
               the river and waves encouragingly. BILL is captivated by 
               the river. Moorhens thread through the tendrils of weeping 
               willow. As electric slip launch is moored where they wait. 
               He strokes its glassy varnish. MAC unloads the boot of the 
               car.

                                     MAC
                         Another world, eh Billy? And not 
                         twenty miles from Picadilly.

               GRACE comes alongside DAWN and waves her mother on the far 
               bank, only forty yards away. DAWN glances nervously at 
               GRACE.

                                     DAWN
                         Are you strong enough for another 
                         shock? You're going to be a grandma.
                              (waves across the 
                              river at her own 
                              Grandmother.)
                         Hello, Grandma.

               GRANDFATHER GEORGE  docks his craft expertly and lassoes a 
               mooring post. GRACE lets out an hysterical cry.

                                     GRACE
                         I don't believe this is happening 
                         to me.

                                     DAWN
                         It's not. It's happening to me.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         responding to GRACE It's only a 
                         house, and a ghastly one at that. 
                         They should all be burned and bombed 
                         and the builder hanged.

               MAC and GRANDFATHER GEORGE load the family's few possessions 
               on the boat.

                                     GRACE
                         What did I do to deserve this?

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         You married that fool, Clive, that's 
                         what. Never mind, you can stay 
                         with us.

                                     GRACE
                              (to Dawn)
                         How long?

                                     DAWN
                         Three and a half months.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         As long as that? Well, all right.  
                         Why not? It's nearly summer. Let 
                         the nippers run wild.

               The children have got into the boat. GRACE turns to MAC 
               and kisses him awkwardly.

                                     GRACE
                         Bless you, Mac. What would I have 
                         done without you?

                                     MAC
                              (ruefully)
                         You might still have a house.

                                     GRACE
                              (wistfully)
                         I wish it could all have been 
                         different.

                                     MAC
                         Look after yourself, Grace.

               He watches them as they cross the river, conscious of the 
               gap widening between himself and GRACE.

                                     GRACE
                         Everything I have left in the world 
                         is in this little boat.

               BILL studies GRANDFATHER GEORGE's sculling technique.

                                     BILL
                         Can I try?

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Put your hand on mine, get the 
                         knack of it.

               BILL holds the gnarled old hand and moves in unison.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         I shall teach you the ways of the 
                         river. Another year in that awful 
                         suburb and you would be past saving.  
                         Look, they're coming this way! The 
                         future on the march. I curse you, 
                         Volt, Watt and Amp.

               Looming over GRANDFATHER GEORGE's bungalow is a newly 
               constructed electric pylon.

               INT. BUNGALOW - BILL'S AND DAWN'S BEDROOM - DAWN

               BILL wakes, looks at the river.

               EXT. BUNGALOW - DAWN

               A grey dawn light touches the mist lying over a glassy 
               river.  BILL comes down out of the house and stands at the 
               edge of the water: not a breath of wind, not a soul 
               stirring. He slips out of his grandfather's voluminous 
               pajama pants.  Delicately, he lowers himself into the river, 
               careful not to crack the perfect smoothness of the water. 
               He slides slowly in until only his head is showing. He 
               swims out into the centre of the stream, without disturbing 
               the water. He stops, takes a breath then submerges, leaving 
               not a ripple, never a trace. The dawn river is once more 
               unobserved, its secret self again.

               INT. BUNGALOW - BILL'S AND DAWN'S BEDROOM - DAWN

               BILL comes in wet from bathing, to find DAWN half dressed 
               contemplating her slightly swollen nave. They share a small 
               room in which are two bunk beds.

                                     DAWN
                         Have a listen. See if you can hear 
                         anything.

               With some reluctance, BILL puts an ear to her stomach. His 
               cold wet hair gives her a shock. She slaps him.

                                     DAWN
                         You're icy cold. A shock like that 
                         could give me a miscarriage.
                              (grinning)
                         That's an idea, do it again.

               DAWN giggles and it is BILL's turn to be shocked.

                                     GRANDMA (O.S.)
                         Breakfast, all!

               DAWN leaves the room while BILL climbs into his clothes.

               INT. BUNGALOW - DINING ROOM - DAY

               The room lets out, through open French windows, on to a 
               back garden sown with vegetables for some yards and then 
               giving way to orchard and pasture. The morning sun streams 
               in.  GRANDFATHER GEORGE sits at ne end facing the garden. 
               GRACE, SUE, GRANDMA and DAWN flank him. GRANDFATHER GEORGE  
               is not the best in the morning. He glares at BILL as he 
               enters and slips quietly into his seat.

                                     GRANDMA
                         Did they say how long it would 
                         take to get new ration books, Grace?

                                     GRACE
                              (shouting and 
                              emancipating)
                         Up to six weeks, I think.

                                     GRANDMA
                         How are we going to cope?

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Nettle soup, like we did in the 
                         Great War. Very nourishing. Bill 
                         and I will catch fish. The river 
                         fowl will be laying eggs soon.  
                         We'll hunt, We'll forage. We'll 
                         overcome.

                                     GRANDMA
                         What about tea and sugar. Clever 
                         Dick?

               GRANDFATHER GEORGE holds up a warming hand.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Keep still! Nobody move!

               His aspect fills them with dread. His eyes are boring holes 
               in the cabbage patch, outside the French windows, where a 
               rat is crouching.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                              (dramatic whisper)
                         Mother!! Fetch my gun.

                                     GRANDMA
                         What's that, dear?

               He points urgently at where the gun stands against the 
               wall.  GRANDMA creeps on tiptoe over to the gun and hands 
               it to him, resuming her place without making a sound. He 
               raises the shotgun, aiming along the length of the table. 
               The children are statues, only their eyes darting from him 
               to the rat and back. The barrel is inches from their faces. 
               He fires. They jump. Smoke fills the room, He curses under 
               his breath, as the rat escapes. He puts down the gun and 
               readdresses his boiled egg, as an afterthought, he turns 
               to BILL.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Never let a rat creep up on you.

                                     BILL
                         I think you hit him, Grandpa. He 
                         was limping when he ran off.

               GRANDFATHER GEORGE gives him a searching look, but BILL is 
               all innocence. DAWN stifles a giggle. GRACE sees what goes 
               on and suppresses a smile herself. BILL suddenly coughs 
               and splutters to hid his laughter.  DAWN goes red in the 
               face, tears come to her eyes and her shoulders shake. SUE 
               suddenly tinkles with innocent mirth and the suppressed 
               laughter bursts out of them all. They roar and gasp and 
               shudder and cannot stop. GRANDMA, quiet perplexed, smiles, 
               happy to see them all so happy. GRANDFATHER GEORGE, eyes 
               blazing with anger, glares at them disdainfully, but the 
               dam has burst and, fear him as they do, the laughter pours 
               out unabated and their eyes are filled with tears.

               INT. RIVER - DAY

               GRANDFATHER GEORGE  poles the punt up the river. GRACE, 
               GRANDMA and SUE lounge in the cushions. BILL stands 
               alongside the old man, learning the way of it.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Up, two, three. Throw the pole 
                         forward, let it slide through your 
                         fingers.  Don't push until it hits 
                         the bottom.

               BILL takes it all in.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Now check that spinner.

               BILL crawls along the shiny deck and hauls in a fishing 
               line.

                                     BILL
                         No luck, Grandpa.

               He lets it out again. A wood-fired steam launch, all 
               polished brass, with an elegant canopy, chugs past them. 
               An elderly couple occupies it, seated in wicker armchairs.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                              (raises his cap to 
                              them)
                         Good day, ma,am. Greetings Edward.

               They are beguiled by the smell of the afternoon. GRACE 
               trails her fingers dreamily through in the water. Willows, 
               bulrushes, glides past.

                                     GRANDMA
                         ...such nice boys with straw boaters 
                         and blazers. All the punts lit up 
                         with Chinese lanterns. Like 
                         fireflies. And the gramophone going 
                         on one of the boats. Always the 
                         Charleston, the Charleston, the 
                         Charleston. Oh, you girls.

                                     GRACE
                         Wasn't it lovely?

               GRANDFATHER GEORGE entrusts the pole to BILL. He struggles 
               with the technique, does quite well. The the pole sticks 
               in deep mud. He cannot extricate it.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Let it go. Let it go.

               But BILL hangs on to the pole and the punt moves on until 
               he is stretched between them. Finally, he hops on to the 
               pole and clings to it.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Stay put. Hang on.

               He takes a paddle and drives the boat back to where BILL 
               is stranded. The pole starts to topple in a small arc.  
               GRANDFATHER GEORGE renews his efforts and BILL is able to 
               step neatly on to the rear decking. The old an eases the 
               pole from the mud.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Now there's a lesson for life.  
                         Never give up the punt for the 
                         pole.

               EXT. GRANDFATHER GEORGE'S RIVERSIDE GARDEN - DAY

               Tea is being laid on the lawn by GRANDMA, GRACE and DAWN; 
               GRANDFATHER GEORGE reclines in the faded swing-seat. BILL 
               ferries FAITH, HOPE and CHARITY (his three aunts) to the 
               island in the dingy. He rear-sculls with some difficulty, 
               but well enough. GRANDFATHER GEORGE examines his daughters 
               with binoculars as they 'ooh' and 'aah' greetings on their 
               approach. They disembark and there is much hugging and 
               kissing. They have all brought clothing for the family and 
               dresses and blouses are held up, examined and admired.

               The daughters clearly disapprove of GRANDFATHER GEORGE and 
               only offer perfunctory kisses, HOPE ignoring him completely.  
               SUE is held up and passed from hand to hand as though she 
               were a frock herself. They take it in turns to shout 
               clarification to their mother. They flutter around DAWN, 
               who is now showing her pregnancy.

                                     FAITH
                         No word from Bruce, my pet?

               It was meant well, but it makes DAWN bristle.

                                     FAITH
                         All men are beasts, darling.

                                     DAWN
                         That's what I like about them.

                                     FAITH
                         Dawn! Really!

               BILL slides over to his grandfather.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         All hens and no cocks. Too many 
                         women in the family. They're a 
                         different species from us, Bill.  
                         Love them, but don't try to 
                         understand them. That road leads 
                         to ruin. Let's make a nuisance of 
                         ourselves.

               He mingles among the women, deciding to goad his daughter 
               HOPE.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         You look frustrated, Hope. That 
                         husband of yours still can't rise 
                         to the occasion?

               HOPE flares up, but bites her tongue and turns away.  
               GRANDFATHER GEORGE turns to BILL, confidingly.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         I won't have the husbands here. 
                         All four married duds, including 
                         your mother.

                                     HOPE
                         He's a menace. He ought to be locked 
                         up.

                                     CHARITY
                         Don't let him get his claws into 
                         you Billy, Grace.

               GRANDFATHER GEORGE continues his advice to BILL.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         They'll tame you if they can, cage 
                         you and feed you tidbits. Better 
                         retreat to prepared positions.

               He leads BILL round to the back garden away  from the river.  
               All the bungalows are built up on piers against flooding. 
               He reaches under the house and retrieves an old cricket 
               bat and ball. He thrusts the ball at BILL.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Bags I bat first.

               He takes guard against the trunk of an old apple tree. 
               BILL twists his fingers around the ball and bowls a spinner 
               to GRANDFATHER GEORGE who waits for it to break, then plays 
               it back. The next ball breaks the other way and clean bowls 
               him.  GRANDFATHER GEORGE looks back at BILL with 
               astonishment.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         That was a googly!

                                     BILL
                         I know.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         You're a dark horse, bowling 
                         googlies at your age. Toss me up 
                         another.

                                     BILL
                         No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my 
                         turn.

               With ill grace, GRANDFATHER GEORGE surrenders the bat and 
               offers a harmless arthritic delivery which BILL thumps 
               into the gooseberry bushes. GRANDFATHER GEORGE curses and 
               pricks his fingers as he tries to retrieves the ball. He 
               looks up irritably at the sounds of laughter from his 
               daughters. He snarls in their direction.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Want to know why they're called 
                         Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?

                                     BILL
                         Why?

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Your grandmother. She named them 
                         after virtues I lack. That's 
                         marriage for you.

               He bowls again. BILL hammers it away. GRANDFATHER GEORGE 
               glares at him, trembling with fury.

                                     BILL
                         It's only a game, Grandpa.

               GRANDFATHER GEORGE gets himself under control and trots 
               off to find the ball.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               BILL and SUE are in the dingy, pushing a stand of reeds. 
               BILL hangs over and bows, hauling the boat along by pulling 
               on the reeds. The parting rushes reveal a moorhens nest, 
               neatly suspended above the water on bent-over reeds meshed 
               together.  There are some dozen speckled eggs. BILL 
               carefully extracts one of them ad places it in a little 
               basket in the boat, which already contains a number of 
               eggs which he has presumably taken from other nests.

               Further upstream, BILL steps out of the boat into some 
               shallows.  He gropes under the water and hauls up a night 
               fishing line.  SUE shares his disappointment when there is 
               no catch.

               EXT. BUNGALOW - DAY

               The dingy pulls up at the landing stage. GRANDFATHER GEORGE, 
               using a stick, limps down the garden to meet them. SUE 
               hands him the basket of eggs.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Where's the fish? No fish, no 
                         supper. Be off with you and don't 
                         come back empty handed.

               He gives the boat a shove with his stick and turns back to 
               the house. SUE looks weepy. BILL mouths some of his 
               repertoire of swear words. From the dormer window, DAWN 
               witnesses their humiliation. She laughs and waves. As 
               GRANDFATHER GEORGE turns back to the house, she ducks out 
               of sight.

               EXT. WEIR - DAY

               They row up to the head of the weir. BILL casts a line and 
               fixes the rod to the gunwale, He ties up the boat and slips 
               over the side. He checks a net arrangement he has fixed at 
               the base of the waterfall to snare unwary fish swimming 
               over the weir. It is empty. SUE paddles in the soft weed 
               that grows on the steps of the weir, letting it seep between 
               her toes. BILL kneels and runs his fingers through the 
               same luminous-green weed. They become absorbed in it. BILL 
               lowers his body into the water and lets himself slide over 
               the weed.  SUE follows suit. Soon they have discovered a 
               glorious game, sliding like eels down the weir and plunging 
               into the pool below. Back and forth they go. In the far 
               distance, an air raid siren wails, They pay no attention, 
               so caught up are they in their pleasure. SUE checks the 
               fishing line fixed to the boat. Nothing.

                                     SUE
                         I'm scared of going back without 
                         any fish. I hate Grandpa.

               They look up at the SOUND of 'ack-ack' fire. BILL spots a 
               German plane high above them.

                                     BILL
                         Looks like a stray bomber. He's 
                         lost his squadron.

               Suddenly there is a BLAST OF AIR and a BOOMING EXPLOSION. 
               Two hundred yards up the river, a great plume of water 
               spurts up.  They drop flat on the steps of the weir. BILL 
               peers cautiously over the rim of the waterfall. SUE seems 
               his astonishment turn to a broad grin. Floating towards 
               the weir are dozens of fish stunned by the blast. Joyously, 
               they gather them up and throw them into the boat.

               EXT. BUNGALOW - DAY

               GRACE, dawn and the GRANDPARENTS all look amazed admiration 
               at the boat laden with fish.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         This is going too far, young man.

                                     BILL
                         But Grandpa, you said...

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         I concede I was insistent, but how 
                         the Devil...

               DAWN looks sharply at the smug faces of her brother and 
               sister.

                                     DAWN
                         It looks a bit fishy to me.

                                     GRACE
                         Could we salt them, or smoke them, 
                         do you think?

               They fall to unloading the fish.

                                     GRANDMA
                         It's like feeding of the five 
                         thousand. It's a miracle.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Well,lad. So it's miracles now, is 
                         it?

                                     DAWN
                         They'll stink the place out by 
                         morning. Why not invite all your 
                         friends to supper, Grandpa.

               He looks up darkly from his task.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         I have no friends, only relations.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               BILL, now wielding the pole with great aplomb, send the 
               punt gliding up river. DAWN heavily pregnant and languidly 
               melancholic, lies in the cushions, bare foot dangling in 
               the river. DAWN stiffens as the figure of a man in uniform 
               comes running along the riverbank. As he catches up with 
               them, he is revealed as BRUCE and the uniform of a Canadian 
               soldier.  He waves and calls them.

                                     DAWN
                         Ignore him, the bastard.

               BILL hesitates, but a withering look from DAWN keeps him 
               on course. BRUCE levels with them. He calls across thirty 
               yards of river.

                                     BRUCE
                         Dan! It's me!

               She refuses even to acknowledge him. Under her breath, she 
               instructs BILL.

                                     DAWN
                         Keep going. Stay on this bank.

               BILL whips up speed, keeping to the opposite side of the 
               river from BRUCE, who wades out up to his knees and holds 
               out his arms, pleadingly.

                                     BRUCE
                         Give me a chance to explain.

               SUE waves at him. DAWN glowers at her.

                                     DAWN
                         I'm going to kill you, Sue Rohan.

               Fully clothed, his khaki cap perched on his head, BRUCE 
               swims out towards the punt. By the time he reaches the 
               middle of the river, they are fifty years upstream. BRUCE 
               swims back to the shore. Dripping wet, he runs up the 
               riverbank until he is well ahead of the punt and plunges 
               in again. This time, his course coincides with the punt. 
               He grabs the side of the boat and hangs on, out of breath.

                                     BRUCE
                         Couldn't write...secret 
                         posting...came as soon as I heard 
                         about the baby.

               DAWN grabs a paddle and forces him under the water. He 
               pops up further down the boat.

                                     BRUCE
                         I went AWOL to be with you. I'm a 
                         deserter.

               She cracks the paddle over his head. He sinks under the 
               water, his cap floats away. BILL rescues it. BRUCE does 
               not reappear. They wait, become alarmed. DAWN kneels down, 
               peers into the water.

                                     DAWN
                         Oh, Bruce, Bruce. What have I done?

               His head pops up inches from her face. Levering himself up 
               on the boat, he kisses her on the mouth. She grabs his 
               hair smothering him with kisses.

                                     DAWN
                         I missed you so much.

               BILL and SUE exchange disgusted looks.

               INT. CHURCH - DAY

               They are all gathered together. GRANDFATHER GEORGE, GRANDMA, 
               GRACE, HOPE, CHARITY, BILL and SUE. CLIVE, in uniform, 
               gives his daughter way. MAC and MOLLY are together again 
               All witness the quiet, subdued marriage of DAWN and BRUCE. 
               The only guests are two military POLICEMEN sit in the back. 
               They appear to be ordinary soldiers until they step outside 
               the church and put their red caps on.

               EXT. CHURCH - DAY

               The bridal pair come out and the VICAR, considerably 
               embarrassed, makes his excuses and backs away. A picture 
               is taken. The REDCAPS seize BRUCE by each arm. DAWN clings 
               to him, a last kiss, and he is borne away. They all stand 
               at the church doors waving to him as he is driven away in 
               a jeep.  There is some dutiful sniffing from the women, 
               but since DAWN seems quite happy, there is no need for 
               sympathetic tears.  GRACE impulsively hugs MOLLY.

                                     GRACE
                         I'm so glad you could come. Here 
                         we are, all together again.

                                     MOLLY
                         Happy as can be. In the old groove.

               CLIVE shakes MAC's hand warmly.

                                     MAC
                         So you're going to be a grandfather.

                                     CLIVE
                         And I'm still just a lad myself.

                                     MAC
                         Don't bother to grow up. It's no 
                         fun at all.

               EXT. BUNGALOW - DAY

               The party is on the veranda. BILL and SUE sit on the steps.  
               GRANDFATHER is alone on the swing seat. GRACE and her three 
               sisters are a sting quartet. They finish a piece. The others 
               clap. It leaves them a little melancholy.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         What can you do with four daughters, 
                         I asked myself, A string quartet 
                         was all I could come up with. They 
                         hated me for making them learn.

                                     GRACE
                         And now we're glad you did.

               CLIVE raises his glass. He is tipsy.

                                     CLIVE
                         Here's to music. And absent friends.

                                     MAC
                         And absent bridegrooms!

                                     CLIVE
                         And the bride.

                                     ALL
                         The bride.

                                     CLIVE
                         And here's to my C.O. He's wangled 
                         me a posting close to home. He 
                         said your house burns down, your 
                         daughter gets married, you're always 
                         on compassionate leave. You might 
                         as well stay down there!

               There are cries of congratulations and encouragement.

                                     GRACE
                         I've found a bungalow to rent up 
                         the towpath, Clive. I never want 
                         to leave the river again. The 
                         children have had such a wonderful 
                         summer.

                                     CLIVE
                         Fair enough.
                              (raises glass)
                         The river.

                                     ALL
                         The river.

                                     CLIVE
                         And loyal friends.

               He tips his glass at MAC, who squirms a little. The drink 
               has made CLIVE sound excessively sincere and sentimental, 
               so much so that if he were sober, it might seem like irony.

                                     CLIVE
                         ...and good and faithful wives.

               He points his glass at MOLLY and GRACE and waves it at the 
               sisters and DAWN.

                                     CLIVE
                         We hope, and trust.

               He laughs, and the others join in, an awkward moment. GRACE 
               and MOLLY catch each others eye.

                                     CLIVE
                         And grumpy grandfathers.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Since you are shortly to join our 
                         ranks, I throw down the gauntlet. 
                         A cricket match. You and Mac against 
                         Bill and me. Back garden.

               The three men and one boy rise to the challenge and file 
               down the side of the house to the lawn at the back.

                                     CLIVE
                         You know Mac played for Surrey 
                         Seconds, and I opened for the Indian 
                         Army. Are you sure...

               GRANDFATHER GEORGE waves his objection aside.

                                     MAC
                              (to Clive, an aside)
                         It's an olive branch. Take it.  
                         It's the best he can do.

               EXT. BUNGALOW - GARDEN - DAY

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         We're putting you in to bat.

               He hands CLIVE the bat, and flips the ball to BILL with a 
               broad wink. CLIVE takes guard against the apple tree, which 
               is now heavy with fruit. BILL bowls. The ball turns, beats 
               the bat. MAC pats down the grass where the ball bounced.

                                     CLIVE
                         Fine delivery, Bill, Good length.  
                         Turned a bit too.

               GRANDFATHER GEORGE hands the ball back to BILL and nudges 
               him.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                              (whispering)
                         Give him the you-know-what.

                                     BILL
                         Very well, Grandpa.

               BILL delivers his googly. It bamboozles is father who pops 
               up caught and bowled. CLIVE is startled. As MAC takes the 
               bat, CLIVE offers a warning.

                                     CLIVE
                         I think it was a googly.

               MAC takes guard. BILL Bowls. He plays forward, smothering 
               the spin. Still no run. The next ball is pitched short. 
               MAC plays back, waits for the ball to break in from the 
               leg which it does more sharply than he expects. He just 
               manages to dig it out. The next is the googly. MAC does 
               not spot it. It cuts i from the off and clean bowls him. 
               GRANDFATHER GEORGE cackles triumphantly.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Googly. You didn't spot it either.

                                     CLIVE
                         I taught him how and now he turns 
                         it against me.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         The law of life. Cruel, isn't it?

                                     MAC
                         The wicked old bugger.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         This boy will make his way in the 
                         world.

               GRANDFATHER GEORGE slaps BILL on the back with such 
               enthusiasm that he sends the boy sprawling. CLIVE catches 
               him, holds him close and whispers in his ear.

                                     CLIVE
                         I'm proud of you.

               Cries of alarm come from the house. CLIVE hears his name 
               called. They hurry back.

               INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               The men arrive to find the women in a state of alarm. They 
               are gathered in a knot around DAWN. BILL pushes his way 
               forward.

                                     GRACE
                         Clive, go for the doctor. It's 
                         Dawn. She's in labour.

               BILL peers between the women and catches a glimpse of DAWN 
               standing arched against a chair, one hand supporting the 
               baby's head which has appeared between her legs.

                                     CLIVE
                         Hot water! Lots of hot water!

                                     FAITH
                         What for?

                                     CLIVE
                         I don't know. They always say that 
                         at the pictures.

               He rushes out.

               EXT. BUNGALOW - VERANDA  - DAY

               CLIVE runs down to veranda steps.

                                     HOPE
                         She just went to the toilet, and 
                         it came out.

               MAC joins CLIVE and they run to the boat and fumble 
               awkwardly with the oars.

               INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               GRACE tries to be calm. She holds DAWN gingerly.

                                     GRACE
                         Now take deep breaths, and push.

                                     DAWN
                         Why? It's coming on its own. It 
                         doesn't hurt.

               BILL comes to SUE's side and they catch another glimpse of 
               the baby's head. SUE wrinkles her nose.

                                     SUE
                         It's all sticky.

               BILL passes clean out and crumples to the floor.

                                                          FADE TO BLACK:

               EXT. GROUNDS OF A GREAT HOUSE - DAY

               BILL is running flat out, running for his life. He passes 
               a blurred orchard, a garden, a park.

               EXT. NEW BUNGALOW - DAY

               BILL, still running hard, looks over his shoulder and turns 
               in to a bungalow that faces on to the river.

               INT. NEW BUNGALOW - DAY

               The living room is cheerful and spacious. Out of the window, 
               the sun sets over the river. DAWN breast-feeds the baby, 
               now a week or two old. GRACE knits a tiny pair of leggings. 
               SUE is drawing a picture. CLIVE snoozes in an armchair. 
               They are listening to Churchill on the wireless.

                                     CHURCHILL (V.O.)
                         ...it is not the end. It is not 
                         the beginning.

               BILL enters, flushed and panting. His eyes are bright with 
               excitement. He goes to DAWN and, reaching inside his shirt, 
               pulls out a peach and hands it to her reverentially.

                                     BILL
                         I scrumped it. I nearly got caught.  
                         They chased me for ages.

               DAWN take's it. It looks pretty miserable. Most of the 
               furry skin has rubbed off during its hazardous journey 
               next to BILL's skin. DAWN's first impulse is to make a 
               sarcastic comment, but in her new maturity, she bites it 
               back and smiles.

                                     DAWN
                         You did that for me, and on the 
                         last day of your holidays?

                                     BILL
                              (blushing)
                         Well, for the baby, really.

                                     DAWN
                         Thank you Billy, from the baby and 
                         me.

               INT. GRANDFATHER GEORGE'S CAR - DAY

               GRANDFATHER GEORGE drives his old Armstrong Siddeley 
               Sapphire along the river towpath. Beside him sits a very 
               morose BILL wearing  a school cap, with a satchel, gasmask, 
               and a suitcase on his lap. GRANDFATHER GEORGE adjusts the 
               advance/retard lever and glares at the sullen boy.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         You miserable little tripe-hound.  
                         I'm the one who should be fed up, 
                         sacrificing my last sup of black 
                         market petrol to take you to school.

                                     BILL
                         I have to live in Rosehill Avenue 
                         as well.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Only till they get you into the 
                         local school.

                                     BILL
                         With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         You'll be at home for the weekends.  
                         Now shut up, or walk.

               They pass a film unit setting up equipment on the river 
               bank.  Extras dressed as soldiers - Germans, British, 
               American - lounge, smoke and drink tea.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Strapping fellows playing silly 
                         buggers with a war on. Outrageous.

               BILL cranes back watching as long as he can.

               EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

               The car draws up outside the school entrance. A grim wall 
               surrounds the institution and BILL gets out, head hung 
               low, and walks towards the gate as though to the gallows.  
               GRANDFATHER GEORGE watches from the car. He grips the 
               steering wheel angrily. A teacher strides past. GRANDFATHER 
               GEORGE shouts after him out of the window.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         All you do is knock the sense out 
                         of them and fill them up with muck.

               EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

               As BILL enters, he is astonished to see hundreds of children 
               in a state of delirious celebration. Boys fling their caps 
               in the air. They cheer. They whoop. They run amok. Behind 
               them lie the smouldering ruins of the school. BILL cheers 
               louder than anyone. He remembers his grandfather, turns on 
               his heel and runs back to the road.

               EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

               GRANDFATHER GEORGE is awkwardly turning the car in the 
               road.  He drives off. BILL runs flat out and comes up to 
               the window, shouting.

                                     BILL
                         Grandpa! There's no school! It's 
                         been hit by a bomb!

               GRANDFATHER GEORGE slows up.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         I have to hand it to you, Bill, 
                         you come up with some good ones.  
                         Go back and take your medicine.

               He drives off leaving BILL stranded. A fire engine and ARP 
               vehicles race up to the school. They pass GRANDFATHER GEORGE 
               and doubt shows in is face. He stops, gets out. Boys are 
               spilling out of school, cheering. BILL runs up to him.

                                     BILL
                         It's true.

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         You're much more convincing when 
                         you're making it up.

               They get into the car.

                                     BILL
                         Grandpa, if you think of something 
                         hard enough, can you make it happen?

                                     GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Apparently so.

               A barking laugh wells up and escapes his throat. It bursts 
               forth in great waves like a flood that has been dammed up 
               for years.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               GRANDFATHER GEORGE's laugh, and BILL's too, ring out over 
               the autumn river which beckons to BILL with the promise of 
               stolen days.

                                                               FADE OUT:

               THE END
