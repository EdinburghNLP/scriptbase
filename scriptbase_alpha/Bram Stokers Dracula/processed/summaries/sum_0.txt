This version of Dracula is closely based on Bram Stoker's classic novel of the same name.
A young lawyer (Jonathan Harker) is assigned to a gloomy village in the mists of eastern Europe.
He is captured and imprisoned by the undead vampire Dracula, who travels to London, inspired by a photograph of Harker's betrothed, Mina Murray.
In Britain, Dracula begins a reign of seduction and terror, draining the life from Mina's closest friend, Lucy Westenra.
Lucy's friends gather together to try to drive Dracula away.
