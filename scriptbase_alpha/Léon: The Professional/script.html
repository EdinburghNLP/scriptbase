Notes:
The beginning is identical to the movie, so we considered 
useless reporting it here.  It's from Mathilda's first rifle 
training scene that the original script is totally different 
from the movie. This version is much more violent and the 
affective relation between Leon and Mathilda shows no more 
ambiguities. In this version, Mathilda was to be aged 13 or 
14

* * * * * * * * * *

Leon and Mathilda arrive on the roof of a building which 
faces Central Park. They get close to a wall and maintain this 
position. Sunlight floods the park.

                         LEON(concentrated)
         Firstly, you look. For more than one 
         minute. Because there are alarm systems 
         with one minute period.  Therefore, you 
         wait and look.  Alarms firstly, the sky 
         for helicopters, nearby buildings.  
         Meanwhile, you observe soil's color and 
         will try to wear dresses of the same 
         color. Never lighter.

Mathilda listens very carefully.

                         LEON
         OK. Good. Now you can assemble your 
         weapon.  

He opens the violin case and assembles a rifle with 
telescopic sight and silencer.

                         LEON
         The rifle is the first weapon you learn 
         to use, because you can keep far from the 
         client. The more experience you have, the 
         closer you get.

He finished assembling the weapon and hands it to Mathilda. 
She's going to pull off telescope's cover.

                         LEON
         No. Always take it off at the last 
         moment, because of light reflexes. 
         They'll see you in two seconds.

They get close to roof's edge. Mathilda sits down and gets in 
position.

                         LEON
         Relax. You must feel at ease.

Mathilda leans down properly.

                         MATHILDA
         OK, I'm fine.

                         LEON
         Good.

He removes telescope's cover.

                         LEON
         Here, this is the light scoop for night 
         shooting. There, you fix client's 
         distance... How much to the bench down 
         there in the park?

                         MATHILDA
         Huh... 500 meters?

                         LEON
         130... 140...

                         MATHILDA
         How can you say it?

                         LEON
         Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 
         50 meters.  When you just see his hands, 
         it's about 80 meters. When you 
         distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130.  
         When you see nothing more than a shape, 
         you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have 
         one chance out of five to miss.  A 
         contract means getting all chances on 
         your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a 
         client. Never... If the task is delicate 
         or the risk is too big, you double. That 
         is, you insure yourself by another means.

                         MATHILDA
         What, for example?

                         LEON
         Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I 
         know weather is going to be bad, rain for 
         example, I think I would plastic the car, 
         with a remote here. I shoot from the 
         distance and if I miss I plastic.

                         MATHILDA
         What if you can't approach the car or he 
         changes car?

Leon thinks.

                         LEON
         Rocket launcher.

                         MATHILDA
         Oh really?
                   (She looks at the 
                   road and imagines)
         But can you miss the car?

Leon pulls a small box out of the violin.

                         LEON(showing a special bullet)
         It's a coded bullet... You put it in the 
         rifle, you glue it to the car, no matter 
         where.  Then you take your rocket 
         launcher and the rocket will get there 
         automatically.

                         MATHILDA
         Wow! It's brilliant!

                         LEON
         Yeah...  Come on, have a little 
         training.

Mathilda gets in position.

                         MATHILDA
         Who'll I aim at?

                         LEON
         Whoever.

Leon pulled out binoculars. Mathilda looks for a victim by 
telescope. She passes over playing kids.

                         MATHILDA
         No women... No kids....

Leon smiles: she learnt the lesson.

                         LEON
         Begin from a steady target. It's easier.

She stops on a man who's reading a newspaper.  The man wears 
a suit, Herald Tribune, fat.

                         MATHILDA
         The fat man down there, on the bench.

                         LEON
         Perfect.

Mathilda aims at the fat man. One of bench's boards explodes. 
The fat man turns his head. He doesn't understand what 
happened and resumes reading.

                         LEON
         Try again. The same.

Second shot. The bench explodes on the opposite side.  The 
man is still curious but doesn't understand.

                         LEON(at binoculars)
         Too much to the left.

Mathilda concentrates again and shoots: nothing happens.  
Mathilda wonders whether she missed again and prepares for a 
new shot.

                         LEON
         Wait...

The fat man softly leans down on his side.

                         LEON
         Bull's-eye.

Mathilda is happy but, evidently, she expected death to be 
more spectacular.

                         LEON
         Come on, now a walking one.

Mathilda aims at a businessman. She really chooses the 
ugliest one. She shoots. Man's case explodes and he hides 
behind a tree: he's scared and doesn't move any more.

                         LEON
         Good! First shot!

                         MATHILDA
         Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his 
         case and now he's behind the tree. What 
         can I do?

                         LEON
         It's not serious, it's just training. 
         You have to learn from the beginning to 
         hit the target, then, to improve 
         precision, you'll train, but on 
         cardboards.

                         MATHILDA
         OK.

                         LEON
         Now, try a running guy.

Mathilda gets back to telescope and looks for a jogger.

                         MATHILDA
         The yellow and pink.

                         LEON
         OK.

The guy is footing, sweaty, with a walkman and headphones. 
Mathilda shoots once. Twice. Thrice. The bullets pass around 
the jogger, who can't see or hear anything.

                         MATHILDA
         Shit! It's hard when he runs!

Leon hands her another charger.

                         LEON
         Don't lose him! Concentrate. There, 
         reload.  OK, keep calm. Calm, breathe 
         deeply.  Look at his movements.  Imagine 
         you're running with him. Breathe... Hold 
         your breathe... His movements... Now... 

She shots and the guy gets a bullet in a thigh. He's scared, 
but doesn't know where to go.

                         MATHILDA
         Did you see? First shot!  It's good, 
         isn't it? Did I learn well?

Mathilda proudly smiles.

                         LEON(serious and steady)
         Put tools away.

Mathilda obeys, seriously.

Night over city. The two are on a small building's stairway.

                         LEON
         Codes!

Mathilda gets by his side for her new lesson.

                         LEON
         For codes, there are two solutions.  You 
         have to choose depending on your needs.  
         First case: you have time. You need the 
         code for a later time. So, you wait for 
         night, you get a box with soot powder and 
         blow a little on the keyboard.  He does 
         it and pulls out a screwdriver.

                         LEON
         Then you break the little lamp to be 
         sure the client can't see anything.  You 
         wait for someone who gets inside, so you 
         have just to see which numbers he 
         touched.  Once you know the four or five 
         digits, you have to try all combinations; 
         once per hour and not more than a minute 
         to do not get found.

                         LEON(continues)
         Second case: you have no time but you 
         mustn't get discovered.  Screwdriver.

He disassembles lock's cover.

                         LEON
         Here, wires need the code.  Always four 
         wires.

An approximately 40-year-old man climbs the stairway. He 
evidently lives in the building.

                         MAN
         May I...?

                         LEON
         Pardon.
                   (To Mathilda)
         Let pass.

Leon opens the door by disassembled lock's wires. The man is 
going to pass, but doesn't. Leon's going to resume his 
explanation.

                         MAN
         Excuse me, but... What are you doing?

                         LEON
         I teach to the girl.

                         MAN
         Do you teach her how to break buildings' 
         doors, don't you?  Don't you give a shit 
         about me?  Get away before I call the 
         Police!  The man is very nervous, 
         searches in a pocket, then pulls out an 
         anti-aggression bomblet. He'll have no 
         time to use it: Leon pulled out his 
         silenced gun.  A shot to the hand and the 
         bomblet takes off. Shot's energy makes 
         the man turn around. A second shot in the 
         back makes the man get over the parapet 
         and disappear in a decorative bush, 
         almost without noise.  Mathilda is 
         immobilized. Leon looks around, then 
         resumes.

                         LEON
         So... the wire which starts from the 
         bottom of the metal part and then, you 
         try the other three wires, one by one.

At second wire, the door opens. Leon smiles.

                         LEON
         Simple, isn't it?

She nods yes.

                         LEON
         What's up? I don't feel you're 
         concentrated.

                         MATHILDA
         Yes, yes...

She gets close to the parapet and looks at the bush.

                         MATHILDA
         It's incredible! How did you do it?

                         LEON
         What?

                         MATHILDA
         There, the guy... How did you do that, 
         without even touching him? Without noise. 
         It's like you put him away... How did you 
         do it?

                         LEON(pause - proud)
         Did you like it?

She pauses and seriously looks at him.

                         MATHILDA
         It was brilliant.

Leon and Mathilda at cinema. On the screen, Fred Astair 
breaks out as usual.

                         LEON(talking about Fred Astaire)
         Look at his movements... Whatever he 
         says, whatever he does, he never stops. 
         Sad or happy, the movement always goes 
         on.

Pirouette by Fred Astaire.

                         LEON
         ...Look! Even the wall, nothing stops 
         him.  The movement goes on. He uses 
         everything: soil, wall, his rush, his 
         weight.  Life is movement, death is a 
         part of it.

Mathilda listens carefully.

                         LEON
         So, you have to let the client finish 
         the movement he started.  It's better, he 
         thinks about other things and he can't 
         see death's arrival.  He's got no time to 
         suffer. He isn't surprised.  He's got no 
         time even to think.  He departs without 
         realizing.  He departs in the movement he 
         started.

Mathilda looks at the screen, sparkling eyes.

                         MATHILDA
         ...It's brilliant.

MUSIC

Series of short sequences.

Morning in the apartment

Television turned on. Mathilda and Leon have some abdominals. 
After some bendings, Mathilda collapses and remains on the 
floor. Leon goes on, undisturbed. Mathilda tries again.

Weapons assemblage

Leon disassembled a big weapon in front of him. Mathilda 
observes, very concerted. Leon reassembles it in record time. 
She's stunned. He hands her the weapon. Mathilda doesn't know 
where to start from.

Mathilda's room

In the little room, Mathilda started a collection of target 
cardboards. The first targets have just two or three off-
center hits.

Living room

Leon's making abdominal flexes, feet always blocked under a 
wardrobe. Mathilda is making gym in front of television. Leon 
glances at her now and then.

Kitchen

Leon pours a big glass of milk. Mathilda sits in front of 
him. She's tired. He hands her the glass. She shakes her head 
no, but he clearly shows she can't discuss. She takes the 
glass without pleasure.

Weapons assemblage

Mathilda's much quicker now, but makes an error. Leon stops 
her and takes over to explain her mistake. Mathilda 
understands and restarts.

Mathilda's room

Cardboard collection expands. More and more impacts on 
targets.

Living room

Mathilda was able to convince Leon to make his gym in front 
of television and with music. She teaches him, since he's not 
used to this and is quite embarrassed.

Kitchen

Mathilda pours two glasses of milk. She gives one to Leon: he 
drinks then they have a race. Mathilda does everything to be 
fast. Leon is too used: he wins. The two laugh because 
Mathilda spread milk everywhere. Two kids.

Mathilda's room

Mathilda adds a cardboard to her collection. Five impacts, 
all virtually on target.

TONY'S RESTAURANT
Leon sits in front of Tony. From his position, he can see the 
window on the street.

                         TONY
         It's a long time, Leon.  You missed two 
         nice contracts, you know.

                         LEON(badly lying)
         ...I was training.

He looks at the street: Mathilda is pirouetting in front of 
the restaurant.

                         TONY
         ...You moved too, didn't you?

                         LEON
         Yeah.

                         TONY
         Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your 
         same floor?

                         LEON
         ...Not at all.

                         TONY
         It's better...  You see, it's my turf, 
         so I don't want contracts I'm not 
         informed about, on my turf.  I'm not 
         opposing, but the least they can do is 
         informing me, isn't it?

                         LEON
         Yes.

Mathilda, outside, sends a "cuckoo" to Leon, who slightly 
leans down to reply. Tony didn't see anything.

                         TONY
         At a certain moment I thought: maybe 
         Leon would like working on his own? So he 
         makes some little extras?

                         LEON
         Dirty work, and I kill no women and no 
         kids.

                         TONY
         That's what I later told myself!  No, 
         Tony, forget Leon! It can't be him, he 
         likes too much his job to make such a 
         slaughter!

Leon can't avoid looking at Mathilda, who's looking up to 
breathe better. This little woman, only survivor of a 
massacre.

                         LEON
         Tell me... The money I earn and you keep 
         for me...

                         TONY
         Do you need money?

                         LEON
         No... Just to know... Because it's a 
         long time I work... And I never did 
         anything with my money... I should do 
         something.

Tony is a little surprised by Leon's naivete.

                         TONY
         It's true, you're right... Did you meet 
         a woman?

Leon smiles.

                         LEON
         No, no.

                         TONY
         Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are 
         dangerous, you know?

                         LEON
         Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't 
         know any.

                         TONY
         Listen, think about what you want to do, 
         but don't worry, your money is there and 
         it's safer than in a bank... Banks are 
         robbed every five minutes!

Tony makes an effort to laugh.

                         TONY
         Anyway, you can't have a bank account, 
         so the discussion is finished.

Leon nods.

                         LEON
         Why can't I have a bank account?

                         TONY
         I'll explain you, Leon: they'll ask you 
         to fill in a lot of forms and you can't 
         write and they'll ask you your job, your 
         employer's name and you can't tell them: 
         My job, I'm a hitman and my employer is
         Tony, his record is longer than his
         resturant's menu.  That's why you can't
         have a bank account!

Leon thinks. Outside, Mathilda lets a young man approach her. 
They start talking. Leon gets nervous.

                         TONY
         But your money is there, Leon. When you 
         want, you ask me. Take...

He hands one thousand dollars to Leon.

                         TONY
         Take...

                         LEON
         Well, I don't need them...

                         TONY
         Take them, you never know... If you want 
         to have some fun. Take, it's a gift.

Tony puts the money in Leon's hand, who takes it.

                         LEON
         Thanks.

                         TONY (smiling)
         Good. Let's talk business, now?

                         LEON
         I've got a hit perfect for you. I kept 
         it for you. To be made alone. That's what 
         you like. Don't move, I get the file.  
         Manolo! A glass of milk for Leon!

Tony stands up and disappears. Leon looks out. Mathilda 
accepts a cigarette from the young man. They laugh. Leon can't 
resist any more. He stands up and exits. He kindly pushes 
Mathilda aside. The quite nice young man waits.

                         LEON(low voice)
         Pay attention, Mathilda. You can't let 
         people approach you like that. People are 
         kind and very fast, they offer you drugs 
         or other things.

                         MATHILDA (smiling)
         Leon, don't worry. I'm on the street 
         since I've born. I was just smoking a 
         cigarette while waiting for you.

Leon pauses and looks at the young man, who smiles at him.

                         LEON
         Keep away. He looks suspicious. A bad 
         guy, OK?

                         MATHILDA (smiling)
         OK.

                         LEON
         Five minutes. Keep in front of the 
         window.

                         MATHILDA
         OK.

INSIDE THE RESTAURANT

Leon sits in front of his milk. Tony comes back and sits 
down.

                         TONY
         I have to put on my glasses... My sight 
         is worse and worse... I'm getting old... 
         Here it is.

Tony hands a photo to Leon, who observes it.

                         TONY
         Not easy. Armored car, isolated home, 
         bodyguards all time.  I don't know what 
         he trades, but it's a good hit because 
         I've got three contracts on him... Three 
         times eight thousand for Leon.  Good 
         deal, isn't it?

Outside, Mathilda has disappeared. Leon gets upset. Tony 
takes the photo back.

                         TONY
         I write client's data on the back. You 
         have to be quick, he's going to quit the 
         city at the end of the week. With the 
         contracts on his head, I don't think 
         we'll see him again.

Leon is too nervous. He takes the photo and stands up.

                         LEON
         I come back later for details. I've got 
         something to do and... I'm late.

He gets out, looks left and right. You've never seen anyone 
as nervous as him. Mathilda, crouched down behind the door, 
jumps on his back. He's relieved and slightly smiles. She 
hangs on him like a little monkey.

                         LEON
         Come on, get down!

                         MATHILDA
         You were scared, weren't you?

                         LEON
         I was nervous, that's all! Where is the 
         guy?

                         MATHILDA
         I killed him... and cut him and ate all 
         of him... I left nothing for you!

Leo suddenly realizes Tony is behind the window. He shyly 
smiles, slightly embarrassed. Mathilda makes a big smile to 
him and heels Leon.

                         MATHILDA
         Let's go home!!!

* * * * * * * * * *

Leon arrives to the hotel, Mathilda still on his back. The 
receptionist smiles at Leon, who doesn't return. Mathilda gets 
the key with a big smile.

                         MATHILDA
         We'd a nice walk!

                         RECEPTIONIST (smiling)
         Good, Miss.

Mathilda cackles and leads her mount upstairs.  In the room, 
she jumps on the bed.

                         MATHILDA
         Leon?  I think I'm falling in love with 
         you. 

Leon's milk goes the wrong way. She calmly said it, laying on 
the bed, spread arms.  Like a simple truth. Leon got milk 
everywhere.

                         MATHILDA
         ...Anyway, this impressed you!

He dries himself, but doesn't reply.

                         MATHILDA
         It's strange, being in love... It's the 
         first time for me...

                         LEON
         How do you know it's love, if you've 
         never been in love before?... It may be 
         friendship... or the love you can have 
         with a brother or a father... How can you 
         know?

                         MATHILDA
         ...Because I feel it.

                         LEON(upset)
         Huh? Where?

Mathilda puts a hand on her stomach.

                         MATHILDA
         Here... in my stomach... it's hot.

She turns, takes his hand and puts it on her stomach.

                         MATHILDA
         I always had a knot... No longer...

Leon pulls off his hand. He stands up and nervously walks.

                         LEON
         Mathilda, I'm... I'm very happy you've 
         got no more stomach ache, but... this 
         doesn't mean anything.  I'm late for work 
         and I don't like being late for work.

Mathilda smiles. She's calm. She rolls herself into the 
blanket. Leon gets out of the room. He puts various weapons 
into his case and in his violin. He's nervous. This 
conversation upset him. He hears a noise, flowing water: 
Mathilda sings.  She's having a bath. He finished preparing 
his gear. He knocks bathroom's door.

                         LEON
         Mathilda? May I come in?

                         MATHILDA
         Yes.

Leon opens the door. Mathilda is naked and is brushing her 
hair. Leon closes back the door without entering.

                         LEON(embarrassed)
         Sorry.  I heard "yes", so I got in...

Mathilda opens the door. She's still combing her hair. She's 
still naked.

                         MATHILDA
         Yes... You can come in.

Leon is rigid. He takes a towel and deploys it in front of 
her.

                         LEON
         Take it, please.

She rolls herself into the towel, without speaking. Leon's 
relieved.

                         LEON
         I... I've got a contract...  I've got to 
         go now. It's urgent.  ...So, you stay 
         here. You don't move. About telephone, I 
         let it ring once then I call you back, 
         else you don't answer, OK?

Mathilda is sulky.

                         MATHILDA
         Why don't you take me with you?... I'm 
         ready, now.  You said I learn very 
         quickly.

                         LEON
         Quick doesn't mean "ready". And you 
         can't discuss, we said. Right?

Mathilda has to surrender.

                         LEON
         Go on learning like this... Then we'll 
         see.

He gets in the living room and she follows him.

                         MATHILDA
         May I go to the cinema?

                         LEON
         No.

                         MATHILDA
         For musicals?  That's part of the job!

                         LEON
         No, you can't go out.

                         MATHILDA (resigned)
         OK... you come back tonight, don't you?

He takes his violin and his case.

                         LEON
         During my absence, you have to work on a 
         very important thing you badly lack: 
         patience.

He slightly smiles. She's sulky.

                         LEON
         You see, five minutes ago you said you 
         loved me and now you hate me... but I 
         prefer this!

                         MATHILDA
         I hate you because you depart without 
         kissing me. That's all.

She sweetly closes the door in face of him. For a moment, 
he's blocked behind the door. The receptionist is walking 
along the hall and notices Leon prostrated in front of the 
door.

                         RECEPTIONIST
         Did you lose your key, Mister?

Leon recovers from his shock.

                         LEON
         No... I just thought if I'd lost 
         anything...

                         RECEPTIONIST
         And did you forget anything?

                         LEON
         Yeah... But "forgotten" doesn't mean 
         lost

He passes in front of the perplexed receptionist, leaving the 
hotel.

* * * * * * * * * *

The receptionist is at his desk. The hall is empty.  Mathilda 
walks down the stairs, slowly, like a kid who's got nothing to 
do.

                         RECEPTIONIST
         How are you, Miss?

                         MATHILDA
         Fine...

She puts her elbows on the desk.

                         MATHILDA
         I'm sick with practicing, that's it...

                         RECEPTIONIST
         I see. You're good, because I didn't 
         hear anything.

                         MATHILDA
         Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to 
         lessen noise.

                         RECEPTIONIST
         Huh? That's smart!

                         MATHILDA
         I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes 
         music.

                         RECEPTIONIST
         Yeah, true.  But what does your father 
         exactly do for living?

                         MATHILDA
         ...Composer.

                         RECEPTIONIST
         Huh, that's good!

                         MATHILDA
         Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...

                         RECEPTIONIST
         Huh?

                         MATHILDA
         ...No... he's my lover...

                         RECEPTIONIST (pale)
         Huh?

Mathilda sighs and glances at the hall.

                         MATHILDA
         I'm going to have a walk...  I'll come 
         back.

Receptionist's tense smile.

* * * * * * * * * *

MATHILDA'S OLD BUILDING
Mathilda slowly gets to her floor. In front of the door, a 
thin yellow "no entry" police strip.  A cop is distractedly 
guarding the hall; he's talking with a young black girl.  
Mathilda gets in her apartment unnoticed.  She gets in her 
room, recovers her teddy bear and her Polaroid.  Then, she 
gets in the devastated living room. There's dry blood almost 
everywhere.  In the corridor, she raises one of parquet's 
boards. A big roll of 100$ bills is hidden beneath. There is a 
small check-book too. She carelessly puts everything away.  
Noise in the apartment. Mathilda crouches down.  Stansfield 
gets in together with two more guys.  Mathilda can see them 
without being seen. Stansfield is evidently not at ease, he's 
justifying his actions in front of upper-rank officers.



                         STANSFIELD
         So, the guy was there, he'd hidden a 
         shotgun behind the tent, here. His woman 
         was armed too.

                         MAN
         Where were the kids during first shots?

                         STANSFIELD
         I don't know... that was very fast. I 
         didn't see him pulling out his weapon.

The man writes some notes. The second man observes the 
cracked entry door.

                         SECOND MAN
         Did you follow the procedure?  Who got 
         to the door?

                         STANSFIELD (getting nervous)
         What are you looking for, guys? This guy 
         was shit, we found five kilos heroin in 
         the apartment, and you bother me?

                         MAN
         The fact you're a public officer doesn't 
         give you the right to do whatever you 
         want!  The narcotic had been following 
         this guy for two years. They had a lot of 
         information about him. Your quick lonely 
         action upset them.  It's normal they 
         asked for an inquiry.

                         STANSFIELD
         I give a shit about the narcotic 
         department!  And if you'll go on 
         searching in this shit, you'll fall in 
         it. You can find me at my office... 2702.

                         MAN
         It's routine, why are you doing this to 
         us?  

Stansfield didn't listen. He got out.  Mathilda slides behind 
him. She follows him downstairs.

* * * * * * * * * *

IN THE STREET
Stansfield gets on a car and departs.  Mathilda stops a cab 
and gets on board.

                         MATHILDA
         May you follow that blue car, please?

The driver smiles.

                         DRIVER
         Do you also want music and skids at 
         every turn?

She hands him 100$.

                         MATHILDA
         No, I want you to drive smoothly, get 
         your 100$ and tell me what the last 
         question was.

The driver takes the bill and starts moving. He understood 
everything.

Stansfield's car stops in front of a building. Mathilda gets 
out of the cab and follows Stansfield.  She gets stopped at 
the first check-point in the large hall.

                         COP (amused)
         Where are you going, little girl?

                         MATHILDA
         What's that man's name?

                         COP
         Why do you want to know?

                         MATHILDA
         He forgot his money...  My mother's got 
         a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot 
         his money, about 100$.

                         COP
         Huh? I see, but this is the FBI, little 
         girl, and I can't let you in.  But if you 
         leave me his money, I'll give him it 
         myself.

Mathilda thinks.

                         COP (smiling)
         You don't trust me.

Mathilda shakes her head no. The cop laughs.

                         MATHILDA
         Give me his name, I will mail him.

                         COP
         OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman 
         STANSFIELD.

                         MATHILDA
         ...Office 2702.

                         COP
         Yeah... How do you know it?

                         MATHILDA
         ...I heard he said... That's all... 
         Thanks.

Mathilda gets away. The cop looks at her, smiling.

* * * * * * * * * *

Mathilda gets back in the hotel room. She sits on the couch, 
in front of the switched off television.  One has never seen, 
nor heard her that concentrated, and determined. Her face 
looks thirty-year-old.  Noise from the lock; she switches 
television on: anime. Leon gets in, gets off his stuff. He's 
got a parcel. He puts it on the table. Leon is stunned by her 
lack of interest for the parcel.

                         LEON
         ...It's for you...  It's a gift.

No reactions. No replies.

                         LEON
         Would you like me to open it?
                   (He's too excited.)
         ...I open it!
                   (He pulls out a 
                   small dress, flowers 
                   motif. He's very 
                   happy.)
         ...Do you like it?

                         MATHILDA (harsh)
         ...You'd better directly buy the doll to 
         fit in it, that would be clearer!  Leon 
         doesn't understand. He takes the dress 
         and checks it out for defects.

She sighs and gets in the kitchen.  Leon gives up. He sweetly 
lays the dress down on the table and switches television off.  
Mathilda comes back with a lot of pop corn. She switches 
television on again, sits on the couch and turns volume up.  
Leon is perplexed, he doesn't speak. He gets in the bathroom 
for a shower.  Mathilda turns volume down. She stands up, 
glances at the dress, touches it by fingertips. Her face is 
tense. Water flows in the bathroom, but Leon is at door's 
small opening and observes Mathilda. She eventually leaves the 
dress, switches television off and gets to the window to look 
at the sunset.  Leon feels bad. He silently closes the door.

* * * * * * * * * *

Mathilda sits in front of him, like in an arena.

                         MATHILDA (cold)
         I'm sick of this, Leon.

                         LEON
         ...You can leave whenever you want. I 
         don't refrain you.

                         MATHILDA
         ...This is what I don't like, you see: 
         you don't refrain me, but at the same 
         time I can't get out!

Leon is still cleaning his weapons.

                         LEON
         Do you think you learnt patience today?!

                         MATHILDA (getting nervous)
         Well, I'm a poor pupil about patience?! 
         OK?

Leon slightly smiles.

                         LEON
         ...You stayed home, not bad. A good 
         start.

She smiles at him and he returns.

                         MATHILDA
         I've been out all the time, stupid!

Leon's smile disappears.

                         MATHILDA
         I got home to get my stuff.

She pulls out some dollars and puts them on the desk.

                         MATHILDA
         Here. Not 8000. They're 6800. I hope you 
         will credit me for the missing 1200. 
         Furthermore, I'm going to make your work 
         easier: the guy is Norman Stansfield. 
         Office 2702 at FBI, 5th Avenue, 68th 
         Street.

Leon is pale. Open mouth.

                         LEON
         And... How do you know all this?

                         MATHILDA (as if it's evident)
         The above Norman was in my home when I 
         was there, and I followed him, that's 
         all.

Leon tries to keep calm.

                         LEON
         Are you calmly telling me you spent the 
         day at FBI?

She shrugs her shoulders.

                         MATHILDA
         No! I can't come in!  I remained 
         outside! And why do you mind this?  
         You've got client's name, money's on the 
         table: it's a good contract, isn't it?

Leon looks at her, then looks at the money.

                         LEON
         Not taken.

                         MATHILDA
         Why?

                         LEON
         Too heavy.

Mathilda thinks fast.

                         MATHILDA
         Well... Then may you rent me your gear 
         for the day?

                         LEON
         I never rent my gear.

Blocked on every front, she sweetly starts crying.

                         MATHILDA
         Why are you doing this to me, Leon?  Why 
         don't you take me with you for contracts?  
         If you teach me, we'll can do mine 
         together!  That would be good, wouldn't 
         it?

Leon intensely look at her, neither severe, nor badly. Just 
cold, like an iceberg.

                         LEON
         Mathilda, nothing is the same, after you 
         kill someone.  Your life changes forever.  
         You'll can never cancel it, neither from 
         your memory, nor from your criminal 
         record...  You'll never sleep again like 
         before, Mathilda.

Mathilda dries up her tears. She's abandoned, exhausted.

                         MATHILDA
         If you knew, Leon...!  I killed one 
         thousand in my head...  And this never 
         disturbed my sleep.

                         LEON
         OK... And if it's you who gets killed?
                   (Mathilda doesn't 
                   reply.)
         ...Then?  Talking about other people's 
         death is easy, but what about yours?
         She's here! She moves around you, and 
         can get you in a thousandth of second. 
         Because it was your day, your hour, your 
         second...

Mathilda looks at him. Leon gets confused.

                         LEON (con't)
         It's written in the sky, from the 
         beginning, just you don't know! Then 
         someone announces you like this! 
         Suddenly! "Did you ask yourself what time 
         you will die?"  Well, it's now! And it's 
         too late already, you've got a bullet in 
         your lungs already! There!

He pushes her by his index finger, enough to hurt her.

                         LEON
         Painful, isn't it?
                   (He pushes again.)
         You don't like talking about death 
         because you're like everyone: you fear 
         it...

                         LEON
         ...Well, it's this fear that makes you 
         live.  It's because you fear death that 
         you live with so much tenacity. It's 
         because of it that you bear what's 
         unbearable. You can live in a hovel, on 
         lots of trash, everything is better than 
         death and the fear you have of it.
                   (Pause)
         But me... Leon... I don't fear it any 
         more...  They look at each other for a 
         moment.  It takes a long to lose it, this 
         fear, but once you lost it... You are 
         free... And just then you can start 
         working properly... Because you can work 
         on other people's fear, play with it... 
         Because "kill or get killed" have become 
         just words... Do you understand?

Mathilda slightly nods yes.

                         LEON
         ...You can't pretend to make this job, 
         until you get beyond this stage. The day 
         you get free of this fear... Not 
         before...

Mathilda looks at his eyes, without challenge.

                         MATHILDA
         Leon... I have no fear...  It's so.

Leon stares at her. He tries to ascertain truth in Mathilda's 
eyes.  A long pause.

                         LEON
         OK...

He takes a weapon, empties the cylinder, then loads just one 
bullet.

                         LEON (con't)
         ...Do you know this game?

Mathilda nods yes. He turns the cylinder.

                         LEON
         One shot ahead... I start.  

He gets the barrel to his temple so that, if the bullet 
explodes, blood will get out with a downward angle. He's ready.

He pulls the trigger. Nothing happens.  He puts the gun in 
front of her.

Mathilda takes it. She looks at him with so much love he 
almost gets upset.

She's not scared. She'd just like things to be different; 
maybe she'd like Leon to open his heart to her. She sighs, 
looks at the gun. She takes it, lifts the cock and aims the 
weapon at her face. She's resigned.

                         MATHILDA
         ...Love or death.
She gets the barrel in her mouth and looks at Leon. A tear 
drop on Leon's front.  She pulls the trigger. Nothing. She 
puts down the gun. Leon stands up, turns around the table and 
embraces her. He holds her tight. She's surprised. She kindly 
pushes Leon back, to look at his eyes.

                         MATHILDA
         Am I ready?

Leon pauses, slightly smiles and nods yes. Mathilda closes 
her eyes, happy and relieved. She takes his hand and embraces 
him for a long. Leon lets her do.

* * * * * * * * * *

MORNING - A FEW DAYS LATER
Leon and Mathilda in a '50s building. Slightly luxury.  Leon 
checks emergency exits, then gets in front of a door. He moves 
his hand along door's border.

                         MATHILDA
         What are you doing?

                         LEON
         I'm looking for chain's position. 
         Sometimes you can't see it, but you can 
         feel it... Here.  

He opens his overcoat and pulls out large shears. He pulls a 
chewing-gum out of his mouth and squeezes it on the peephole.

                         LEON
         I ring and you make him open, OK?

He rings.

                         MATHILDA (caught slightly off-balance)
         What shall I say?

                         LEON
         Whatever you want.

Mathilda thinks. The guy arrives behind the door.

                         MAN
         Yes?

                         MATHILDA
         Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!

                         MAN
         Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't 
         know any Danielle.

                         MATHILDA
         ...I got lost, Mister.

                         MAN
         Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see 
         anything.

                         MATHILDA
         It's not me, it's dark here... and I 
         can't find the switch.

She looks at Leon and he mimics "mean".

                         MATHILDA
         Mister... I'm scared.

Leon thumbs up.

                         MAN
         Huh? Don't move, baby.

Noise: the man is engaging the safety chain. Leon prepares 
his shears at the correct height.  The man opens the door. The 
chain explodes. Leon already pulled out his silenced gun. The 
man is pressed against a wall.  Mathilda looks around, takes 
the gum off the peephole, gets in the apartment and closes the 
door. Leon catches man's throat.

                         LEON
         Open your mouth.

The man obeys. Leon puts the silencer in his mouth.

                         LEON (con't)
         ...If you let go of the gun...  I pull 
         the trigger, OK?

The man, sweaty, nods yes. Leon checks out the apartment and 
the man follows him like his shadow. Leon moves without paying 
attention to him, forgetting the man is totally concentrated 
to do not let the gun out of his mouth. In the living room, on 
the desk, syringes and the stuff for them. Leon finished 
checking, everything OK. They go into the bathroom.

                         LEON(to Mathilda)
         We go there, good.
                   (to the man)
         Lets go.

The man is so scared he doesn't want to let go.

                         LEON (con't)
         ...You can let go, I said!

At last, he lets go.

                         LEON (con't)
         ...Get to the end.

The man obeys. Leon hands the gun to Mathilda.

                         LEON(to Mathilda)
         Go... It's your time.

She aims at him, concentrated. She signs to the man to move 
left. He obeys. She pulls the trigger. A dull noise. The man 
collapses to the floor.

                         LEON
         Good... Safety, now. The second shot.
Mathilda approaches the man and shoots again. Maybe too low: 
a squirt of blood on her dresses.

                         LEON
         Here it is!  Look at your dresses, now!  
         How can you walk in the street, now?

He recovers his gun.

                         LEON (con't)
         ...Not a good work, this. When you shoot 
         from this angle, you always get blood 
         everywhere.  You have to move aside and 
         shoot with a little more angle... 
         There... This way.

He shoots. It makes no difference to the man.

                         LEON (con't)
         ...Can you see? Look: not a drop! Come 
         on, try.

He gives her the gun again. Mathilda moves on a side and 
shoots. Perfect.

                         LEON
         Good.

Mathilda returns the weapon. She looks for a little sign of 
gratitude, maybe a compliment, but Leon is hermetic.

                         LEON
         ...Let's go.

* * * * * * * * * *



They are in a luxury restaurant.  Leon pours some champagne. 
Mathilda is happy. They drink. Mathilda drinks everything in 
one gulp, like she's used to with milk.

                         MATHILDA (slightly inebriated)
         I thought we can't drink?

                         LEON
         It's true... But a first contract, it's 
         an exception.

                         MATHILDA
         And... May I kiss you, like in the 
         movies, may this be an exception?

Leon's champagne goes the wrong way.

                         LEON(serious)
         ...No.



Mathilda smiles.

                         MATHILDA
         ...Yes.

She stands up and sweetly turns around the table.

                         LEON(not at ease)
         Mathilda, what are you doing?

                         MATHILDA
         ...I'm going to kiss you.

                         LEON
         Mathilda, stop, please!

She heels on the bench, close to him.

                         MATHILDA
         Come on, let me do. Just a kiss.

She tries to kiss him. He avoids her.

                         LEON
         Stop. Everyone is looking.

                         MATHILDA
         Of course, so kiss me quickly, or 
         they'll notice us.

Leon gives up, at last. She sweetly kisses him.

                         MATHILDA
         Tongue, please.

Leon pushes her away, irritated.

                         LEON
         No, that's enough!  Sit down, now.

Mathilda smiles and gets back to her seat. Good timing, the 
waiter arrives with their dishes. Mathilda exploits his 
presence to fill up again her glasses with champagne. The 
waiter gets away. Leon grabs the champagne bottle and voids it 
in the ice cup.

                         MATHILDA
         ...You don't believe me, don't you?

                         LEON
         What?

                         MATHILDA
         When I say I love you.

                         LEON
         Mathilda, don't resume, please.  
         ....Change subject, OK?

                         MATHILDA
         ...OK.
                   (pause)
         I love you anyway.

                         LEON
         Mathilda?!

                         MATHILDA
         OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when 
         you had your first contract?

                         LEON
         ...17.

Mathilda smiles and lifts the glass.

                         MATHILDA
         Beat you!

* * * * * * * * * *

ANOTHER DAY - ANOTHER APARTMENT - RAIN OUTSIDE
The building is a little more modern. They arrive in front of 
a door. Peephole. Chewing-gum. Shears. Ring. Routine. But 
today nobody replies. Leon nods. Mathilda rings again. Again 
nothing.

                         LEON(thinking at high voice)
         I left him half-an-hour, after he got 
         in... He couldn't get out from the back.

Mathilda waits. Leon puts down his shears and pulls out a 
crowbar.

                         LEON
         Stairways cover.
Mathilda pulls a gun out of her jeans and gets in position 
near stairways. Leon pulls out a metal plate and slides it 
beneath the door, breaks the lock by the crowbar. The door is 
virtually intact. Leon gets in, weapon at hand. Leon moves in 
along the corridor. Mathilda is at the entry, now.

                         LEON(low voice)
Interior cover.

Mathilda gets in and closes the door behind her, by the way 
she pulls in the shears Leon left outside.  Leon is still 
moving, the living room is empty. Open windows, still rain. 
Leon sighs.

                         LEON
         ...Shit!!  We'd found him. We waited for 
         him to get upstairs and he got out of the 
         window.

                         MATHILDA
         What shall we do?

                         LEON
         I think.

Mathilda turns back and walks toward the corridor.

                         LEON
         Where are you going?

                         MATHILDA
         Piddle.
She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is 
going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, 
walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, 
without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door 
again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.

                         LEON
         ...Why didn't he close the window?

He looks around and sees man's overcoat, still wet. His wet 
shoes are on the radiator.

                         LEON
         ...Because he didn't get out!

Leon stands up, pulls out his gun and runs toward the 
corridor.  Mathilda, against the wall, looks up, to make him 
understand "it's not too soon"!
Leon advances. Mathilda mimics to make him understand the 
bath, the walkman. Leon pulls out his personal periscope and 
looks into the bathroom. The man is still there, music at full 
blast.  Leon puts away his periscope.

                         LEON
         He's sleeping.

He silently gets in the bathroom, followed by Mathilda.  They 
sit down and look at the man, sleeping in the mid of his warm 
bath. Leon pulls out his silencer and screws it on the gun.

                         MATHILDA
         It's cool departing this way... warm... 
         music...

                         LEON
         There are better things.  You see the 
         importance of the "moment".  Ten minutes 
         early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd 
         have suffered it.  This way, he already 
         departed. Without knowing.

                         MATHILDA
         ...I'd like knowing what he's listening 
         to...

                         LEON
         ...Later.

Leon lifts his gun's cock and puts the weapon in front of the 
man.
- Close-up: a finger pushes a lift's button.
- Close-up: red light on, lift's coming.
- Close-up: Leon's hands open a packet of chewing-gums.

* * * * * * * * * *

ANOTHER BUILDING - ANOTHER DAY
Mathilda and Leon in the corridor of a banal building. Leon 
offers a chewing-gum to Mathilda, who accepts it. She's 
listening to a walkman. Leon sweetly pulls the headphones off 
her head.

                         LEON(kindly)
         Mathilda, we're at work!  No music, OK!  

She smiles.

                         MATHILDA
         OK... I like it. It gives me the rhythm.

He smiles. Mathilda finds the door, places her chewing-gum on 
the peephole and gets in position for her "chat". True 
routine. Leon in position. Mathilda rings the doorbell.

                         MAN
         ...Yes?

                         MATHILDA
         Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for 
         Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark 
         out here and I got lost...

                         MAN
         ...One second.

She thumbs up, alright. Leon keeps concentrated. He hears a 
noise he knows. He searches in his memory.  FLASH: Leon loads 
a kalashnikov. Same noise. Leon catches Mathilda and literally 
throws her to the soil. Behind her, the door explodes with 
numberless impacts.  The man inside empties his charger on the 
door. Leon threw away his shears and pulled out his shotgun.  
He's furious, to this extent he fears for Mathilda. He gets 
concentrated as he's never been. The man inside shouldn't have 
become that nervous. Furthermore, he goes on.

                         MAN
         Come on, little stupid?  Is it enough or 
         want some more!  Then? Come on, show me 
         your face!  Come!

                         MAN
         Did you think you could get me by such 
         an old trick?!  The gum trick, I played 
         it before your birth, idiot!  Come on, 
         show me your little fucking face! The gum 
         trick!  Huh! I go.

Mathilda's recovering. Leon sighs.

                         LEON(to Mathilda)
         When it starts this way, it's bad.  You 
         have to make it quickly, or he'll keep us 
         here for hours with his bullshit!

Leon gets a hand under his overcoat and pulls out something.

                         LEON(to the man)
         Hey!... What about the ring trick... Do 
         you know it?

                         MAN
         The ring trick?  ...Come on, little 
         idiot!  Show me your famous trick.  Come 
         on, I'm waiting! Come!  

From the inside, you see a grenade rolling in the apartment.

                         MAN
         ...Shit.

The apartment explodes. Nothing more.



Leon turns toward Mathilda and shows her the ring in his 
hand.

                         LEON
         This is the ring trick.

Mathilda stupidly shakes her head: she's dismayed.

* * * * * * * * * *

TONY'S RESTAURANT
About 4pm. Restaurant is desert, apart from Dino, who's 
keeping books at his usual table. An elegantly dressed man 
gets inside. He's forced to put away his sunglasses because of 
the feeble interior light. He looks nervous. He sits in front 
of Tony. He's a little surprised.

                         TONY
         Tell me, there's nobody in the 
         restaurant: you're not forced to sit at 
         my table?

                         MAN (still not at ease)
         ...I need company.

The man pulls out his badge and hands it to Tony. He works 
for FBI.

                         TONY
         Rinaldi... Rinaldi...  What region do 
         you come from?

                         RINALDI
         Messina.

                         TONY
         Emilio? Due grappe!
                   (to Rinaldi)
         ...Why the hell did you come here?

He returns his badge.

                         RINALDI
         Rightly... I came here to recover.

Rinaldi hands him a small photograph. Tony looks at it and 
turns it to read the note on the back.

                         TONY
         But... He works for your same employer?

                         RINALDI
         Yeah, but I don't give a shit about.  I 
         trade at left, at right and that's 
         dangerous in there...

                         TONY
         It's a little out of the world coming to 
         visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It 
         really isn't the usual procedure...

                         RINALDI
         I know... But I'm a little pressed.

Tony is perplexed.

                         TONY
         ...Who sent you?

                         RINALDI
         Giancarlo... Rinaldi.

Tony smiles.

                         TONY
         Is he still alive?

                         RINALDI
         Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my 
         uncle.

                         TONY
         Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?

                         RINALDI
         No... Dino's.

The kid didn't fall in the trap.

                         TONY (smiling)
         ...It's true...  How is he, the old 
         Dino?

                         RINALDI
         He's dead, five years ago...

                         TONY (saddened)
         Sorry...   You see what's this job, you 
         work, you work.  You even don't care 
         visiting friends now and then...

He takes a blackboard and writes 16000 ahead. He gives it to 
Rinaldi. Rinaldi reads, then writes "Is it double". Tony 
smiles.

                         TONY
         Have you ever been in Messina, son?

                         RINALDI
         Yes... Twice.

                         TONY
         Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce 
         spada"?

                         RINALDI
         No...

                         TONY
         It's a specialty down there.  It's a 
         fishing boat with, in front, a long pole 
         near the surface. Then, near the cabin, a 
         very tall mast with a little cabin for 
         the lookout.

                         TONY
         A lookout above, one below, two fishers 
         and a captain.  A lot of people, for such 
         a small boat like that.  They depart to 
         the sea, sometimes for days, never sure 
         they'll get something.

Rinaldi listens. Tony speaks and writes at the same time.

                         TONY (con't)
         Sometimes, it's a lot of work for 
         nothing.  ...And then you must know that, 
         the bigger the fish is, the older it is, 
         the more expert it is...  ...Therefore, 
         the more difficult he is to get.  You 
         understand what I mean, son?

Rinaldi nods his head yes. Tony writes 12000 on the 
blackboard.

                         RINALDI
         I think I will get back in Messina this 
         summer... It's too long I haven't been 
         there.

                         TONY
         You're right, son. You must care the 
         links with your family, always.  It's the 
         only important thing in the world.

                         RINALDI
         ...Yeah.

He says "yes" to the phrase and to the deal.  Emilio delivers 
two grappas. Tony gives him the photo and the blackboard. The 
two drink.

                         TONY
         Salute.

                         RINALDI
         Salute.

NEW APARTMENT - DECREPIT
Leon prepares his tools. Mathilda sits on the windowsill. 
Leon wears his overcoat.

                         MATHILDA (sulky)
         ...I preferred the hotel.

                         LEON
         Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit 
         to the receptionist, we'd still be in the 
         hotel, I make you notice.

                         MATHILDA
         That wasn't bullshit, I said we love 
         each other.

                         LEON
         Yeah!... Anyway, I don't like hotels. 
         Too much people, everyone's got the 
         key... I don't like it.

Mathilda gets even sulkier.

                         LEON
         ...I prefer apartments...  Furthermore, 
         there are always kids in a building.  
         What about getting some friends?

                         MATHILDA
         Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, 
         before, they just cared drugs all day and 
         you couldn't get one, or they just cared 
         video games and you couldn't get one, no 
         more.

                         LEON
         You're darkening the picture, aren't 
         you?

                         MATHILDA
         A little...

                         LEON
         Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?

                         MATHILDA
         Yeah... There's a lot on TV.

Leon is slightly annoyed by Mathilda's lack of cooperation.

                         LEON
         Well, then watch television!

He switches on.

                         LEON
         ...I won't be long, Mathilda, OK?

                         MATHILDA (kind)
         Why don't you take me with you?

                         LEON
         It's too big.

                         MATHILDA
         Yeah... I'm just good for left-overs!

                         LEON(kind)
         Let me alone for a while, Mathilda, OK?  
         My life changed since I met you, you 
         know?  ...I have to find back myself a 
         little...  And, last time, you really 
         didn't pass... And I wouldn't enjoy 
         seeing you explode against a wall...

                         MATHILDA
         Risky business, isn't it?

                         LEON
         ...You're young, Mathilda... You still 
         have a chance to get out.  You can't give 
         up this chance. You have to protect it. 
         There's a lot of things to do in life, a 
         lot of other jobs...

                         MATHILDA
         There are just two things I'm interested 
         in: love and death.  For the moment, I 
         have none of the two!

Leon tries to reply, vainly.

                         LEON
         Mathilda... There's equally a lot of 
         other things!

                         MATHILDA
         Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!

Leon searches.

                         LEON
         ...Nothing, I tell you! Everything else 
         reminds me a big yogurt: warm and rancid.

Leon laughs, she doesn't.

                         LEON
         No, excuse me... It's the yogurt that 
         made me laugh.

                         MATHILDA
         You've just to love me and I'll be the 
         happiest woman around.

                         LEON
         Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're 
         not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need 
         time... And you too. You have to grow up.

                         MATHILDA
         I don't grow up any more. I just get 
         older.

Leon sighs. He takes his case and gets out.

                         LEON
         I won't be long. Two days at most, 
         promised.

He closes the door. Mathilda remains sad, at her window.

RAIN ON THE CITY - 

MATHILDA'S BORED

SERIES OF SHORT SEQUENCES

- She's on the windowsill and looks at the flowing water that 
will temporarily clean the city.

She smokes a cigarette.

She opens the double bass.

She assembles and disassembles a Uzi, last model.

She watches television, falls on her head, embedded in her 
soft chair. She eventually switches off, at this extent the 
program bored her.

She finishes her syrup peaches, while listening to music.

She shoots some self-portraits by her Polaroid, mandatory 
grimace.

* * * * * * * * * *

NO MORE RAIN - SUN RAYS OVER THE CITY
Mathilda is at a public phone.

                         MATHILDA
         ...Good day, Madam, may I talk with 
         Jenny, please?

                         JENNY
         Yes?

                         MATHILDA (smiling)
         ...It's Mathilda.

                         JENNY
         HEY!!  But what did you do?! What 
         happened?? It's months you've 
         disappeared. Everyone thinks you got 
         killed, at school, above all since some 
         FBI guys got to school and asked a lot of 
         questions about you!

                         MATHILDA (surprised and proud)
         Huh?... Did they ask you any questions?

                         JENNY
         Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I 
         said I don't know you.  But do you know 
         what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?

                         MATHILDA
         No?

                         JENNY
         She told them you wanted her things and 
         that she wasn't surprised police looked
         for you! Can you believe it?!

                         MATHILDA
         Asshole. But she won't miss anything, 
         that. You'll see.

                         JENNY
         Good, what are you going to do? Do you 
         come back?

                         MATHILDA
         No... I can't... I got tired. I want to 
         live my way.

                         JENNY (surprised)
         ...Did you leave alone?

                         MATHILDA (smiling)
         ...No.

                         JENNY
                   (shouting)
         YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I 
         know him?

                         MATHILDA
         No.

                         JENNY
         Come on, shit, tell me! Is he beautiful?

                         MATHILDA (moved)
         ...Yes, I think.

                         JENNY
         I can't believe it! "Yes I think"...  
         How she kids me! I can't believe it!  And 
         did he pass your threshold or not?

                         MATHILDA
         ...What?

                         JENNY
         Well... Did you sleep with him or not?

                         MATHILDA
         No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and 
         very sensitive.

                         JENNY
         ...Good...  But what's special in him?

                         MATHILDA
         ...I don't know... It's true he touches 
         me. I love him.

Tears slide down along Mathilda's cheeks.

                         MATHILDA
         I'll miss you, Jenny.

She softly puts down the receiver.   Sun recovers. City is 
yellow.

TONY'S RESTAURANT
The old Tony at his usual table. Three little boys in front 
of him. Their hands on their eyes.

                         TONY
         Don't peep, OK? Attention...

Emilio arrives and puts down a chocolate cake with five 
candles on it.

                         TONY
         You can look!

The boys shout with joy. Stansfield now gets in the 
restaurant with six men. Tony immediately stiffens.  
Stansfield blows on the candles and leans toward the children 
with a stupid smile.

                         STANSFIELD
         Happy birthday!

Without smiling, he signs one of his men to regroup the kids 
with Emilio. The children obey. As if they feel it's not the 
moment to bother.  Tony doesn't oppose.

                         TONY
         You'd better talk good, son, because, 
         for the moment, I've got a quite bad 
         opinion about you.  Norman smiles.

                         STANSFIELD
         I respect your business, Mister Tony.  
         Every time we asked your help, we were 
         very happy with the result.  It's right 
         this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope 
         you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?

                         TONY
         Then...

                         STANSFIELD (to one of his men)
         Take me the pork!

One takes in the young Rinaldi who had visited Tony. His face 
is made swell, unrecognizable.

                         STANSFIELD
         Do you recognize him?

                         TONY
         ...Even his mother wouldn't.

Stansfield looks at Rinaldi.

                         STANSFIELD
         You're right.

He pulls out his gun and kills him. Like one kills an insect. 
Tony strongly stiffens. Emilio looks after the children.

                         STANSFIELD
         I've got an offer for you: you keep your 
         12000$, you call back your shitful 
         cleaner and you tell him the contract is 
         cancelled.  You see, the man to be killed 
         is my boss, and I'd be really sorry with 
         losing him because he's a good boss.  He 
         lets me work like I wish... It's fine. 
         And 12000$ to do nothing aren't bad, 
         aren't they?

Tony is really disturbed.

                         TONY
         Listen, son, you know as well as me this 
         kind of hitmen: they come from nowhere, 
         get the contract and disappear. They're 
         lonely, worse than wolves.

                         STANSFIELD
         May we have this wolf's name and 
         address?

                         TONY
         These guys have no place.  They change 
         virtually everyday. And his name...  It's 
         a surname.

Stansfield pauses. He stares at Tony.

                         STANSFIELD (to his right hand)
         Take me the children...

Tony closes his eyes. Stansfield puts his gun on the table. 
Children make a row in front of the table.

                         STANSFIELD
         ...Come on, I make you a favor.  Tell me 
         which is the one you love least. I'll 
         kill him first.

Tony slightly sighs.

                         TONY
         You know, boy, I know their parents very 
         well; I think they won't appreciate your 
         sense of humor.

                         STANSFIELD (falsely naive)
         Huh, really?

                         TONY (serious)
         If you touch them, you'll have all the 
         hitmen of the city on your ass!

                         STANSFIELD (pause)
         ...You're right. It's a little risky.

Stansfield takes his gun and kills Emilio.

                         STANSFIELD
         It's good he had no family. Come on, 
         speak, now!

Tony is petrified. Children shout and get under the table.

                         STANSFIELD
         Else, I'll have to ruin this birthday.

                         TONY (surrendering)
         ...Leon... Leone MONTANA. I know he's in 
         a small hotel in Noho... But I don't know 
         where... Houston Street, I think... I 
         can't tell you more...  Even if you kill 
         all the neighborhood.

Stansfield puts away his gun and stands up.

                         STANSFIELD
         Thanks Tony.  Justice will be grateful 
         for your precious collaboration.  

He points at Emilio's corpse.

                         STANSFIELD
         ...Would you like me to call the police, 
         for this little incident?

Tony looks down, then shakes his head no.  Stansfield smiles.

                         STANSFIELD
         Good!

The group gets out. Children run into Tony's arms.

* * * * * * * * * *

NEW BUILDING
Mathilda sits at stairways' end, in front of a long corridor 
and a small court.
Five kids, about 13-year-old, play baseball in the corridor.



                         THE BOSS
         You're the new one at 5th?

Mathilda nods yes.

                         THE BOSS
         Shall we explain her everything, ok?  
         This will avoid misunderstandings.

Mathilda waits, curious.

                         THE BOSS
                   (to Mathilda)
         You can't sit here like that.

                         MATHILDA
         Huh? Why?

                         THE BOSS
         Because you have to pay.  It's like a 
         parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's 
         the rule...

                         MATHILDA
         ...And how much is it?

                         THE BOSS
         Ten dollars... A month.

Mathilda looks at them and pulls out a roll of 100$ notes.

                         MATHILDA
         Got the change for 100?

The kid is impressed but tries not to show.

                         THE BOSS (playing serious)
         ...Wait, Poly's the treasurer.
                   (to Poly)
         Poly, have you got the change for 100?

                         POLY (shrugging his shoulders)
         Why do you ask me?  You know I haven't a 
         dollar!

Mathilda saves his face. She hands him the note.

                         MATHILDA
         ...It's not serious...  It means I'll 
         pay ten months in advance.

The kid takes the money, perplexed.

                         THE BOSS
         ...OK... Good.

                         MATHILDA
         Can I sit on the stairways now?

                         THE BOSS
         Huh... Yeah, yeah... Of course.

Everyone is surprised by Mathilda's calm.

                         A KID
         ...Would you like a cigarette?

                         MATHILDA
         Yes... Thanks.

Another kid lights it. The last one pulls out a bottle of 
whisky.

                         THE KID
         A little draught?

                         MATHILDA
         No thanks...  Never alcohol.

* * * * * * * * * *

LATER - IN THE COURT
The kids and Mathilda play baseball.  The ball gets to 
Mathilda. A little too fast: she avoids it.

                         THE BOSS (shouting)
         Huh! Mathilda, bitch! Run! Run!

Mathilda runs, gets the ball and launches it very awkwardly.  
The boss is furious.

                         THE BOSS
         ...Bitch! You're really nil!  Come on, 
         get away! Get back to your stairways!

Mathilda abandons the game, oppressed.

                         THE BOSS
         You fear a ball?!  I can't believe it!! 
         Gals!...  Come on, let's play, not a game 
         for gals!

Mathilda stands up, this time she's really annoyed. She gets 
upstairs. She opens the violin and takes a gun. Downstairs, 
kids have a pause.

                         THE BOSS
         Good, let's have a break, five minutes.  
         Poly? Cigarettes.

Mathilda joins back the kids downstairs.

                         MATHILDA
         Look, the fearful's got a game for you.

She pulls out the gun, opens the cylinder.

                         MATHILDA
         ...You can show me your balls!  Russian 
         roulette, you know?

* * * * * * * * * *

IN FRONT OF MATHILDA'S BUILDING

Police line. Two cops guard. Open ambulance waiting for its 
load.   Leon arrives by cab. He immediately realizes something 
happened. Mathilda. He's worried about her.

He gets off the cab. He stammers something to the first cop.

                         LEON
         ...I live in here...

He breaks through. At the end of the corridor, near 
stairways, a little corpse, covered by a white sheet. Blood at 
one end.  Two male nurses easily lift the corpse and lay it 
down on the stretcher. Leon's scared by that sheet, that 
little corpse. He lifts one end. Big sport shoes. Far from 
Mathilda's small feet. He's going to climb upstairs, but a cop 
blocks him.

                         COP
         No entry for the moment.

                         LEON
         I live in here.

The cop puts a hand on Leon's chest to stop him

                         COP
         When I say no entry, I mean "no entry".

He said this with a bad tone. Leon stares at him.

IN THE APARTMENT
A plain clothes detective sits in front of Mathilda, who's 
crying on her couch. Evidently, the cop's waiting for her to 
stop crying, for interrogation. He looks at his wristwatch.

Another two cops calmly, sweetly check out the apartment. 
Routine. They pass by the double bass without opening it. Leon 
gets in. She jumps in his arms. He's relieved. She cries with 
joy.

                         LEON(sweet)
         Come on, it's over, I'm here.

                         MATHILDA (in tears)
         You mustn't leave me, Leon...  I do 
         stupid things, when you're not here.

                         LEON
         I'm here, I'll never leave you again, 
         Mathilda, never. I swear.

                         MATHILDA
         I love you so much, Leon.

                         LEON
         I love you too, and I don't want to lose 
         you.

The cop is really stunned by Leon's arrival.

                         COP
         Can I have a word with you, Mister?  Are 
         you her father?

Leon signs him "stop". The cop is slightly annoyed by such an 
authority.

                         LEON(to Mathilda, sweetly)
         What did you do?  What happened? Tell 
         me.

He caresses her hair. She's calming down.

                         MATHILDA
         ...Well... The kids. They didn't want me 
         to play baseball. They said I'm a fearful 
         gal.

The cop listens, interested.

                         LEON
         Poor darling, and then?

                         MATHILDA
         Well... I proposed them to play 
         roulette...  Like we played...
                   (She resumes 
                   crying.)
         ...And I lost.

He takes her in his arms. The cop is stunned.

                         LEON
         Don't cry, Mathilda, please.  Take.
                   (hanky)
         Prepare your case and we get away for a 
         while, OK?  We change neighborhoods! Come 
         on, go, I wait, OK?

                         COP (determined)
         Mister?  I'd like seeing your papers.

Leon already pulled out his gun and showed his identity. 
Thrice.

                         LEON
         Come on, prepare your stuff, we move in 
         a much calmer place, you'll see. Near the 
         country.

Leon doesn't care he just killed three cops.

Mathilda puts her Polaroid and her teddy bear in her sack. A 
photo falls on the ground. They leave the apartment. No more 
double bass. Just violin and sack.

While going downstairs, one realizes how difficult Leon's 
climb was: killed cops at virtually every floor.

They get out of the backdoor.  Leon and Mathilda, holding 
each other's hand, walk across the city.  Sun's tired. City's 
orange.

* * * * * * * * * *

It's almost night when Stansfield and his men arrive in front 
of Leon and Mathilda's building.  In the apartment, three 
corpses covered by white sheets.
Police commander on place. STANSFIELD gets in.

                         COMMANDER (nervous)
         ...What are you doing in here?

Stansfield checks out the apartment.

                         STANSFIELD
         ...I've been following the guy for a 
         while.

STANSFIELD finds the forgotten Polaroid photo.

STANSFIELD is perplexed, then recognizes the girl.

                         COMMANDER
         May I know this typhoon's name?

                         STANSFIELD
         ...Leon. 

* * * * * * * * * *

Leon's having a shower. Face in his hands.  Evidently, he's 
trying to recover.  New apartment's door opens, after a few 
knocks that look like a code.  Mathilda gets in. Leon quickly 
moves in the bathroom. His hand approaches a gun.

                         LEON
         Mathilda?

Mathilda passes before bathroom's door and scratches it 
without stopping.

                         MATHILDA
         Yes... Alright.

She gets in the room and unpacks her things, including 
cosmetics. She gets close to the window and starts making up 
herself.



Leon in a towel, small for his size.  He gets in the living 
room.

                         LEON
         Mathilda?

                         MATHILDA (out of scene)
         Yes.... I'm coming

Leon gets to the window and looks out.  Something changed in 
Leon. He's tired by all this, maybe.  He sits on the chair.  
Mathilda's walkman is on.  He hesitates, then eventually puts 
on the headphones.  It's a sweet, almost classical music. Very 
beautiful, like the arriving Mathilda. She wears the dress 
Leon offered her, she's made up. She looks 20-year-old.  
Leon's mouth is open. She smiles and heels down before him.  
He gets off the headphones.

                         LEON
         What's going on?

                         MATHILDA (surprised)
         Nothing... Why?

                         LEON
         Well... I don't know, suddenly, the make 
         up... All this... How are you?  Are you 
         OK?

                         MATHILDA
         Of course! I'm fine!  I put on your 
         beautiful dress, I slightly made up...  I 
         tried to get beautiful!  Don't you like 
         it?

                         LEON(shy)
         ...Yes.

                         MATHILDA
         So say it!

                         LEON(pause)
         ...I like it...

Mathilda smiles and stands up.  She gets in the kitchen.  
Leon feels weird, like he was falling in a trap, without being 
able to do anything.  Mathilda comes back with a glass of milk 
she hands to Leon.  She lowers the tents to dim the strong 
sunlight.  Mathilda heels down in front of him. Leon doesn't 
dare move any more.

                         MATHILDA
         ...Don't you drink?

                         LEON
         I prefer waiting for a while...  I feel 
         it would go the wrong way.  

Mathilda takes the glass from his hands and drinks half.  She 
passes her tongue along her lips to dry up the milk.  Leon 
looks at her, like a child in front of a sweet shop.  She 
returns his milk. Mathilda looks like a calm cat.

                         MATHILDA (sweetly)
         I love you, Leon...  Totally.  It's the 
         first time I feel it that strong.  It's 
         also the first time I trust a man.  I 
         trust you.

She caresses his hand.

                         MATHILDA (con't)
         ...I love your hands...
                   (pause)
         Leon... in your hands... I'd like you to 
         be my first lover.

Leon retracts his hand and finishes the milk.

He looks at Mathilda with as much sadness as happiness.  By a 
fingertip, Mathilda takes the milkdrop on Leon's lips and gets 
it in her mouth.  Leon is going to cry.

                         LEON(feeling bad)
         ...I can't, Mathilda... I can't.

                         MATHILDA (with a sad smile)
         ...Have you got a girlfriend?

                         LEON
         ...No...

                         MATHILDA
         ...Don't you like me?

                         LEON(sincerely)
         ...Yes...
                   (pause)
         ...You're the most beautiful, Mathilda.

Mathilda looks relieved by these magic words.  She puts her 
face on Leon's lap, who caresses her hair.

                         MATHILDA
         You know, girls think about their first 
         boyfriend for a long time... I imagined 
         him with grizzled hair, elegant...  A 
         little like Georgia's father. Georgia is 
         a classmate of mine... Kinda guy makes 
         you feel sure! Cool, isn't it?  Leon nods 
         yes, without really knowing what he's 
         saying "yes" to.  My mates told me the 
         first time they made love was awful.  
         They had pain everywhere, afterward...
         But that's because they made it with men 
         they didn't love.  In fact, they did it 
         just to show off, at the beginning. 
         Later, they liked it.  ...Like 
         cigarettes.

Leon closes his eyes. Kind of pain on his face.

                         MATHILDA
         How many girlfriends did you have?

                         LEON
         ...I don't know.

                         MATHILDA
         Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How 
         many, approximately?

                         LEON
         ...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking 
         about this.

                         MATHILDA
         Why? Did you have too many and you fear 
         it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. 
         I'm used to this!  My father was a true 
         pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother 
         all around the apartment. Whenever a door 
         was closed, you could be sure they were 
         making sex behind it!  And my sister, if 
         you didn't sleep with her, you're 
         building's exception!

                         LEON
         Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!

Mathilda's going to cry.

                         MATHILDA
         I talk because you don't talk, Leon.  I 
         declare my love and you say nothing. 
         That's why I'm nervous and I can't stop 
         talking.  Tell me you love me, or you 
         don't love me, or you love someone else.  
         ....But tell me something.  

Leon tries to recover, before speaking.

                         LEON
         ...I had a girlfriend... A long time 
         ago.  Before coming here, in my country.  
         I was 14-year-old... We flirted like 
         kids...  Her father didn't want her to 
         meet me.  My family was not very 
         respectable.

                         MATHILDA
         Then? You didn't give a shit about her 
         father, didn't you?  You met anyway?

Leon pauses for a long, then nods yes.

                         LEON
         ...He killed her, a bullet in her 
         head...

Mathilda is stunned.

                         MATHILDA
         ...That's awful.  I hope you killed, 
         that asshole?

                         LEON
         ...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I 
         allowed him to make ten steps... No more. 
         And bang. Two hundred meters. By 
         telescope. That night, I left my country 
         and came here, to join my father, who 
         worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I 
         never left the city...  And never had 
         another girlfriend...

Leon sweetly looks at her.

                         LEON (con't)
         ...You see, I wouldn't be a good lover, 
         Mathilda.

                         MATHILDA
         Leon, I don't know life very much... I 
         just know I love you...  And love is 
         stronger than anything else.

Leon is more and more nervous, like a child.

                         LEON
         Maybe... Sure... But... I'm scared, 
         Mathilda.

Leon cries. Mathilda caresses his face.

                         MATHILDA
         Don't fear, Leon.  You mustn't fear 
         love, when it's this beautiful.

She caresses his chest.

                         MATHILDA (con't)
         I want you to be the first to touch 
         me... The first to make love with me. 
         Nobody before you.

She stands up and modestly gets off her briefs without taking 
off her dress. Leon cries, unable to oppose her. Mathilda is 
too young, but she's also too beautiful and lovely and sweet 
and tender...  She sweetly, very sweetly, gets on him.

                         LEON(crying)
         Why me, Mathilda, why me?

Mathilda leans over to speak in his ear.

                         MATHILDA
         ...Because you deserve it, Leon...

Leon embraces her.  He's full of happiness, shame, so many 
emotions, he can't control very well.  But, hell, how 
beautiful it is seeing them sweetly making love.



* * * * * * * * * *

MORNING
A beautiful morning, like one wishes everyone to be.  Leon in 
the bed. It's the first time one sees him in a bed and, 
furthermore, he sleeps.  By his side, on a small table, a gun.  
You never know. On the other side, Mathilda looks at him, 
smiling, because he's almost nice while he sleeps. She starts 
moving to stand up. Leon abruptly wakes up.  His hand reaches 
for the gun. He sees Mathilda and the room.  Mathilda puts a 
hand on his chest and kindly forces him to lay down.

                         MATHILDA
         Did you sleep well?

                         LEON
         ...I never really sleep.

Mathilda smiles.

                         MATHILDA
         Huh, yes? I forgot!  ...When you fake 
         sleeping, you'd better not snore!

                         LEON(trapped)
         ...I snore?

                         MATHILDA 
         Like a baby!

She stands up and wears jeans.

                         MATHILDA
         I go looking for some milk for 
         breakfast... I come back.
                   (She kisses him.)
         ...I love you, Leon.

Leon is shy.

                         LEON
         You... You knock the code, when you come 
         back, OK?

                         MATHILDA
         Yes.

                         LEON
         Three times, then two times.

She nods her head yes. She tenderly looks at him.

                         MATHILDA
         May I ask you a personal question?

                         LEON
         ...Yes.

                         MATHILDA
         What do you do, with the money you earn?

                         LEON
         Nothing, for the moment.

                         MATHILDA
         Maybe it's the time to do something, 
         isn't it?

                         LEON
         Yeah, what?

                         MATHILDA
         I don't know... Getting far away, the 
         two of us, for example...  And forgetting 
         all this...

                         LEON(pause)
         ...Far... Where?

Mathilda smiles.

                         MATHILDA
         I'm gonna buy a globe, you'll see. Bronx 
         isn't even marked, so much the rest is 
         big.
                   (She walks toward 
                   the door.)
         ...Think...

Mathilda gets out. Leon relaxes himself in the bed. He shyly 
opens his arms and learns how to exploit a bed.

* * * * * * * * * *

INSIDE THE BUILDING
Mathilda comes back with her milk. She gets out of the lift 
and a hand covers her mouth.

The man is member of a SWAT team: bullet-proof jacket, 
gloves, and Uzi at hand. He's not alone. They're seven.

                         THE BOSS (low voice)
         From now, you don't make a noise and 
         reply by nodding yes or shaking your head 
         no, OK?

Mathilda nods yes. She learns quickly.

                         THE BOSS
         Is he alone?

Yes from Mathilda.

                         THE BOSS
         Does he expect you?

Yes from Mathilda.

                         THE BOSS
         Have you got apartment's keys?

Yes from Mathilda. She hands him the keys.

                         THE BOSS
         Is there a code, a way to knock the door 
         or something?

Yes from Mathilda.

She approaches her hand to the wall: two knocks, three 
knocks, two knocks. Wrong code.

The boss is satisfied anyway. He signs the group, they get in 
position. Mathilda in a corner, a man remains with her.

                         MAN
         Don't fear.

                         MATHILDA
         I have no fear.

The first three cops are in position. The leader is nervous. 
Everyone is ready. He knocks the code on the door.  Reply 
isn't late. Inside, a classical music starts. Cops get in, one 
by one, commando style.  From the corridor, one clearly sees 
apartment's open door, and one clearly sees also the hand 
above the door, that sweetly closes.

In the corridor, the other cops have no time. They hear the 
slaughter in progress: shouts and shots, for twenty seconds. 
Then door opens again. Three corpses in the apartment's 
corridor. The man with Mathilda uses his walkie-talkie.

                         MAN
         Shit! We need reinforcements! Maximum! 
         Come on!

Mathilda puts a hand in her parcel and pulls out a gun she 
keeps along her body. On door's side, a small reflex. It's 
Leon's periscope, checking the other three cops' progression.

Two of them progress behind armored shields.  Suddenly, 
Leon's voice breaks the silence.

                         LEON(shouting)
         Mathilda?... Now.

Leon appears from nowhere and empties his kalashnikov in the 
corridor. The three cops don't shoot for a long. Mathilda 
lifts her arm, kills the cop at lower landing and aims at the 
cop who kept her.

                         LEON(loud)
         Mathilda?!

She appears in the corridor, her hostage before her, still 
her milk with her. Leon is relieved.

                         LEON
         Don't expose your back! Turn!

Mathilda obeys and walks backward.

She needs her hostage for protection and he remains in front 
of her. Leon covers her from the apartment.

A group of cops, a dozen, gets upstairs.  Leon breaks the 
fire equipment niche's glass, unrolls the pipe in the 
corridor, throws the axe into the apartment and opens the 
water at full pressure. The pipe twists and beats all around 
the corridor.

Leon shoots. Reply is immediate. Fortunately, Mathilda is 
behind her hostage, his bullet-proof jacket is insufficient. 
Leon and Mathilda get back in the apartment and close the 
door, leaving the hostage crucified on it.

Mathilda is nervous.  Leon is concentrated.

                         MATHILDA
         Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't 
         know?

                         LEON
         It will take them five minutes!  How 
         long ago did they arrive?

                         MATHILDA
         I don't know... Five minutes.

                         LEON
         Good! Snipers can't be in position.

Leon gets close to the wall and gets rid of the tents, 
allowing light to explode.

Window explodes too: they shoot like never before.

                         LEON
         ...Ten minutes at least... Not five.

In the corridor, cops eventually catch the pressurized pipe 
and close the water. On all fours, Leon and Mathilda get in 
the kitchen. He gets the axe and the violin case by the way. 
Mathilda is more and more nervous. Leon is more and more 
concentrated.

                         MATHILDA
         How shall we get out now, Leon?

                         LEON
         Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!

He shoots at the dustbin duct and makes it explode. He 
enlarges the hole by axe. Leon throws in the duct his 
overcoat, his sack's content, and his violin (grenades, 
weapons, etc...). Mathilda then throws in her teddy bear and 
Polaroid.

In the corridor, sand bags are becoming a wall, armored 
shields and cops multiply.  A cop gets in position with a 
rocket-launcher and shoots. The door explodes and smoke floods 
the interior.

Leon helps Mathilda to get into the duct. She's half in when 
she seems to realize something.

                         MATHILDA
         But... Leon? You'll never get in it! 
         It's nearly too small for me!?

                         LEON(smiling)
         I know, my love!

Mathilda starts crying.

                         MATHILDA
         No! I don't want to leave you!!

                         LEON
         Mathilda, listen!

                         MATHILDA
         No, no! I don't want to go!  I don't 
         want!

He rudely takes her face in his hands.

                         LEON
         Listen to me, shit!  We've got no chance 
         to get out together!  Alone, I will get 
         out!  Trust me! I'm in perfect shape, 
         Mathilda, now!  I slept well! I love you! 
         I'm happy!  And I thought! I'll get all 
         the money Tony keeps for me and we'll 
         leave, OK? Together! We'll leave 
         tomorrow.




                         MATHILDA
         You say it just to calm me!

                         LEON
         Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because 
         it's true! You'll buy the globe you told 
         me about and you will choose, OK? We'll 
         go where you want! I swear, you'll see, 
         Mathilda!!

He kisses all over her face. Mathilda is a little confused.

                         LEON
         Come on, go! Don't let them find you!  I 
         finish this work and we meet at Tony's, 
         OK?  Spread your arms to do not fall too 
         fast. So, good.  At Tony's! One hour or 
         two, OK?  I love you, Mathilda!

He kisses her again.

                         MATHILDA
         I love you too, my darling.

He pushes her. She disappears in the duct.

Leon pushes his back against the hall and dries up his tears.  
He shouts: terrifyingly.  In the corridor, three first line 
cops progress with gas masks; they decide to get in through 
the destroyed door.

Mathilda gets in the trash bin. She carefully looks out: 
nobody around.  She gets out and recovers some weapons.

APARTMENT
A wounded cop, mask on his face, gets out of the apartment 
and out of the smoke cloud.



         He's therefore protected and taken over 
         by another cop.  He accompanies him a 
         little farther.

A BOSS
         Get downstairs, guy, get down!

He slaps him on his shoulder. The wounded cop obeys and gets 
to the lower floor. He's someway surprised when he realizes 
the stairs are literally full of cops everywhere.

The wounded cop passes by his colleagues and gets down.  Cops 
everywhere, sandbags. It looks like a trench warfare. He 
didn't yet pull his mask off.  One makes him sit on a bench 
and starts pulling off his mask.  A doctor comes in and checks 
out cop's arm. He pulls off his mask. It's Leon.

                         DOCTOR
         It's deep. You'd better get down to the 
         ambulance, they'll care you properly.  A 
         cop chief doesn't recognize Leon.

                         CHIEF
         3rd district?  ...A mess up there, isn't 
         it.

Leon nods yes.

                         DOCTOR
         Let him breathe five minutes!!
                   (to Leon)
         Would you like me to take you down?

Leon shakes his head no.

                         LEON
         Let me put my mask on. I breathe better 
         with it.

                         DOCTOR
         Yeah, right.  Get down and wait for ten 
         minutes. I'll get to check you, OK?

                         LEON
         OK.

The chief gets away. Everything seems to work properly. 
There's just one thing Leon didn't notice: it's STANSFIELD's 
right hand, climbing upstairs, who identifies him and gets 
back down. Mathilda got out.

She observes, from a corner, the movements in the street. 
Police cars and ambulances all around.

IN THE APARTMENT
A cop's checking out the apartment, he pushes kitchen's door 
and a grenade falls to his feet.  The explosion shakes the 
whole corridor. Cops crowd it.  Below, Leon exploits the 
moment to stand up and discreetly walk downstairs. Floor after 
floor without problems.

SLOW MOTION

Behind him, unheard and unseen, STANSFIELD follows him.  
STANSFIELD rises his arm. A gun at hand. The gun aims at 
LEON'S back of the neck.



Leon advances and can see just the light filled exit, synonym 
of freedom.  But his vision gradually gets paler and the image 
tilts, without noise.  The image is now completely inclined 
and gets paler and paler. Overexposed image, then suddenly: 
BLACK.

Leon's died. Without even realizing it.  Mathilda is still 
observing.  Stansfield's right hand gets out of the building 
and lifts an arm to the sky. He wants everyone's attention.

                         RIGHT HAND
         It's alright! We got him!  It's over!

Some cops clap, others whistle. Mathilda leans on the wall 
and cries.  Stansfield is in the corridor, near Leon, officers 
are congratulating him.

                         CHIEF
         Shit! Never seen anything like this 
         before!

                         ANOTHER
         He almost fucked me, furthermore!

                         STANSFIELD
         He killed Richmond, my boss, two days 
         ago... And Rinaldi too!  We've been on 
         him for months.

A chief slaps on his shoulder, but he's embittered, he lost 
many men too.

                         CHIEF
         Nice shot.

SLOW MOTION

Mathilda appears. She wears Leon's large overcoat. A silenced 
gun at hand. Her face is harsh and immobile like never before. 
In front of building's entry, two cops look at her, stunned. 
This will be their last expression.

She gets in the corridor. At the end, STANSFIELD laughs 
together with his colleagues.  Mathilda advances until the 
white sheet on the ground. She crouches down, lifts one end. 
Leon's got blood everywhere, but his expression is sweet and 
relaxed. Mathilda caresses his cheeks.

A man tips on STANSFIELD's back. The group turns and sees the 
little girl crouched near the corpse.  Mathilda kisses Leon's 
mouth and stands up. She leaves her gun on the floor.

She looks at STANSFIELD, straight in his eyes, with a big 
smile.  STANSFIELD doesn't understand. Mathilda pulls her hand 
out of a pocket and launches something to him.  STANSFIELD 
catches the object. It's a metal ring.  STANSFIELD understands 
lesser and lesser.

Mathilda opens her overcoat: inside, a dozen of grenades 
everywhere. One lacks its ring.

STANSFIELD UNDERSTANDS EVERYTHING.

COMPLETE, GENERAL, ABSOLUTE EXPLOSION

The shockwave shakes everyone in the street.  Still in slow 
motion, thousands of debris fall on the street.  A rain which
