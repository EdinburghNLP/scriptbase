                                                          SHOOTING SCRIPT

                                                            July 19, 1978



           

           FADE IN :

       1   EXT SPACE (S)                                                1

           An ever expanding infinity of light and color as CAMERA            

    
           TRAVELS THROUGH deep space, MOVING DIRECTLY for one
           pinpoint of light: a STAR GROWING RAPIDLY as we SWEEP
           TOWARD IT, a normal white star SUDDENLY CHANGING,
           brightening, flaring unbelievable intensity: supernova.
           The CAMERA HOLDS just a moment, then MOVES on, SEARCH-
           ING through space, the jeweled beauty of other star
           systems, sparkling nebulae, swirling hydrogen clouds.
           STILL MOVING, then CAMERA FINDS:

       2   EXT. AREA OF LUMINESCENCE (S)                                2

           In the far distance, slowly growing in size as CAMERA
           APPROACHES: it resembles, vaguely at this distance, an
           Aurora Borealis: flaring colors from the fringes,
           beautiful yet ominous. It is so large, this Cloud, it
           can envelope an entire solar system. CAMERA CONTINUES
           APPROACHING the Cloud, and then suddenly, crossing
           our POV, a:
              
       3   KLINGON HEAVY CRUISER (S)                                    3

           In a graceful, turning arc toward the mysterious
           LUMINESCENCE. CAMERA FOLLOWS this Klingon, then FINDS
           a second Klingon cruiser, also turning toward the Cloud,
           which continues to grow in size as the Klingons
           approach at warp speed, CAMERA CLOSING on the lead
           ship, until the vessel's detail can be clearly MADE
           OUT: lights, weaponry, power systems, identification
           emblazoned on the nacelles and saucer in Klingon
           language (and symbols).

       4   INT. KLINGON CRUISER BRIDGE (O)                              4

           Clearly alien, an ODD-SOUNDING KLAXON signaling
           "battle stations." Orders issued in KLINGON LANGUAGE,
           the KLINGON CAPTAIN and EXEC peering at an unusual
           bridge viewer at the huge area of LUMINESCENT HAZE
           directly ahead. In KLINGON DIALOGUE:

                                   KLINGON CAPTAIN
                             (Give me tactical.)

       5   CLOSE - MAIN VIEWER (O)                                      5

           goes suddenly  to a TACTICAL GRID SYSTEM, showing the
           LUMINESCENT HAZE to be an ENORMOUS BLIP OF LIGHT ON
           THE SCREEN, with two TINY PINPRICKS OF LIGHT complete-
           ing their turn on a direct course toward it.

       6   EXT. SPACE - THE KLINGON PATROL AND THE HAZE (S)             6

           The Patrol is clearly SEEN now on the right of the 
           bottom of the FRAME... THREE tiny ships closing on the             

   
           steadily growing LUMINESCENT HAZE.

       7   INT. THE KLINGON BRIDGE - CAPTAIN AND EXEC (O)               7

           All eyes on the viewer that shows the ships sweeping
           on the Mysterious cloud.

                                   KLINGON CAPTAIN
                             (In Klingonese)
                     Visual.

           The TECHNICIAN makes the switch.

       8   CLOSE - VIEW SCREEN - LUMINESCENT HAZE (O)                   8

           growing ever larger, its flaring colors menacing,
           mysterious, strangely beckoning.

       9   INT. BRIDGE - KLINGON COMMAND CRUISER                        9

           The crew stands by for battle.
                                
                                   KLINGON CAPTAIN
                             (In Klingonese)
                     Tactical again. Stand by on
                     torpedoes.

      10   EAT SPACE - LEAD KLINGON VESSEL (TORPEDO HATCH) (S)         10

           sliding open, the glowing "Hell Fire" of the Photon
           Launch tubes, slowly revealed.

      11   VERY WIDE ANGLE - THE THREE SHIPS (S)                       11

           They are tiny, insect-like shapes moving still CLOSER
           to the Luminescent Cloud, so large now that it begins
           to dominate all space behind.

      12   INT. KLINGON BRIDGE - TACTICAL GRID - CAPTAIN AND           12
           EXEC (O)

           The growing nearness and enormous size of the Cloud
           also reflected on the Tactical Grid, somehow more
           awesome by this schematic view. The Captain gestures
           the order to "FIRE."

      13   EXT. SPACE - ANGLE ON KLINGON VESSEL - TORPEDO HATCH (S)    13

           The BRILLIANT PHOTON BLOBS of the torpedoes spurt from 
           the tubes.

      14   ANGLE ON KLINGON VESSEL (S)                                 14

           A deadly PHOTON TORPEDO pattern racing away from the
           Klingon and toward the Luminescent glow in the distance.

      15   INT. KLINGON BRIDGE - TACTICAL GRID (O)                     15

           Three torpedoes are heading directly toward the Cloud.
           Suddenly they glow briefly and disappear long before
           they reach their intended target.

      16   INT. KLINGON BRIDGE - CAPTAIN AND EXEC                      16

           incredulous that their torpedoes have disappeared
           without a trace.

      17   EXT SPACE - THE CLOUD - THREE KLINGON SHIPS (S)             17

           as the second and third ships launch torpedoes toward
           the color-flaring surface of the cloud. This time we
           have an outside, real VIEW of the torpedoes glowing
           brightly and then disappearing with no effect.

      18   INT. KLINGON BRIDGE (O)                                     18

           The Klingon crew grim, desperate, watching a BRIGHT
           STACCATO BLIP OF POWER from within the LUMINESCENCE.

                                   KLINGON CAPTAIN
                             (quickly; Klingonese)
                     Full force fields; evasive
                     maneuvers.

      19   EAT SPACE - THE CLOUD - THE KLINGON PATROLS (S)             19

           Out of the LUMINESCENCE hurtles a FRIGHTENING WHIPLASH
           OF ENERGY. It bears down on the Klingon Patrol, now
           in an evasive maneuver. Then the WHIPLASH BOLT hits
           the third cruiser in a writhing flare of energy which
           totally engulfs the vessel.

           The other two ships veer off, warping around again into
           attack position. The THIRD SHIP has begun to implode
           in on itself, the matter-energy of its existence
           drained by the WHIPLASH BOLT that HOLDS IT.

      20   ANGLE ON REMAINING KLINGON CRUISERS (S)                     20

           desperately defending themselves, FORCE FIELDS FULL UP,
           RAPIDLY FIRING PHOTON TORPEDOES. But now a SECOND
           WHIPLASH ENERGY BOLT has emerged from the cloud and
           hits the second vessel, DESTROYING it.

           The THIRD WHIPLASH BOLT glances off the surviving
           Cruiser as the ship retreats in a wide, evasive turn,
           FIRING from stern tubes.

      21   INT. KLINGON BRIDGE                                         21

           The bridge shattered; Klingon bodies. The mortally-
           wounded Captain is transmitting urgently:

                                   KLINGON CAPTAIN
                             (In Klingonese)
                     ... severely damaged. Returning
                     fire...

      22   EXT. SPACE - STARFLEET MONITOR STATION EPSILON 9 (S)        22

           Serenity here. A barren, rocky small plantoid softly
           lit by the myriad stars. This is a small Starfleet 
           outpost, antennae sprouting everywhere. Tiny figures
           (WORKERS) servicing one antenna illustrate the size
           of the installation.

      23   INT. EPSILON 9 - MONITOR ROOM - A VIEWER (O)                23

           SHOWING the battle scene, and the VOICE OF THE KLINGON
           CAPTAIN in his last stand against the Object; his VOICE
           is weary, almost mechanical. On the adjacent viewer,
           an English printout of the Klingon's words chatters
           along the bottom of the picture:

                                   KLINGON CAPTAIN
                             (In Klingonese)
                     Imperial Klingon Cruiser Amar...
                     severely damaged by unfamiliar
                     weaponry... intruder unidentified..

      24   WIDER ANGLE - EPSILON 9 STARFLEET PERSONNEL AND VIEWER (O)  24

           At the viewers are a FEMALE LIEUTENANT and FOUR TECH-
           NICIANS. COMMANDER BRANCH, a young, alert, enters hur-
           riedly, scans he console.

                                   LIEUTENANT
                     Our sensor drone is intercepting
                     this on Quad L-14.

                                   KLINGON CAPTAIN (V.O.)
                     ... believe luminescent cloud 
                     to be enormous power field 
                     surrounding alien vessel... 
                     size and description unknown.. 
                     our sensor scans unable to 
                     penetrate. Imperial Klingon 
                     Cruiser Amar... continuing 
                     to attack.

                                   BRANCH
                     That's within Klingon boundaries.
                     Who are they fighting?

                                   LIEUTENANT
                     Unknown, sir.

           A violent EXPLOSION inside the Klingon bridge -- Klingon
           Captain's body is thrown violently against the bulkhead.

                                   TECHNICIAN
                     I have an exterior visual!

      25   CLOSE ON VIEWER (O)                                         25

           showing EXTERIOR of the Klingon vessel: a final,
           frightening WHIPLASH ENERGY BOLT strikes it -- then
           the same awesome IMPLOSION INTO FIREBALL.

      26   WIDER ANGLE - PERSONNEL AND VIEWER (O)                      26

           The Starfleet station onlookers react to the utter
           annihilation of the huge cruiser. And now, past where
           the cruiser just disappeared -- the mysterious LUMINES-
           CENCE approaching in distance. Technician hits a
           switch, magnifying the strange CLOUD.

                                   LIEUTENANT
                     We've plotted a course on that
                     cloud, Commander: it will pass
                     into Federation Space fairly 
                     close to us.

                                   BRANCH
                     Heading?

      27   CLOSE ON THE MAIN MONITOR STATION (O)                       27

           as its focal point shifts to the huge elliptically-
           shaped LUMINESCENCE racing across the sky. MUSIC
           (V'GER THEME) COMMENCES in a low, unresolved CHORD
           that remains in the background through the remainder
           of this scene, and the beginning of the next one.

                                   LIEUTENANT'S VOICE
                     Sir, it's on a precise heading
                     for Earth.

           Ominously now the LUMINESCENCE increases in size, and
           begins to fill the viewer. HOLD A MOMENT, and then:

      28   EXT. SURFACE OF PLANET VULCAN - DAY (M)                     28

           with the CAMERA MOVING THROUGH masses of thick, steamy
           vaporous clouds, swirling about, rising boilingly up
           from some unseen, underground source. The CAMERA
           CONTINUES MOVING through clouds.

           And then... the Vulcan landscape. Harsh, strange
           angular peaks and rock formations -- the barren, legend-
           ary mountain home of Vulcan Masters.

      29   EXT. VULCAN LEDGE - SPOCK ( M & F.P.)                       29

           Spock's lean features instantly recognizable despite
           unkempt, longer hair and the fatigue born of a long,
           harsh discipline he has undergone. His robes, tattered
           and dust covered, are that of a Vulcan Aspirant in
           study with the Masters. Under the V'ger THEME MUSIC
           we HEAR a VOICE in ritual tones:

                                   FEMALE MASTER'S VOICE
                     Spock, son of Sarek of Vulcan... 
                     and of Amanda of Earth... 
                     diligently you have labored for 
                     purification of mind...

      30   REVERSE ANGLE - SPOCK, VULCAN MASTERS AND RUINS             30

           In b.g., gigantic ancient Vulcan statues and ruins. In f.g., 
           the stone platform on which Spock stands facing a semi-circle 
           of three similar platforms. On them in regal robes are three 
           VULCAN MASTERS. The Master in the center is a female, the 
           other two Masters are male. The elderly female is holding a 
           cord and ancient pendant as if ready to place it around            

    
           Spock's neck at an appropriate moment. Spock is staring up 
           as V'ger THEME MUSIC fades.

                                   MALE MASTER
                             (chidingly)
                     Spock . . . !

           Spock turns, giving a small contrite nod -- the ritual
           continues.

                                   FEMALE MASTER
                     Here are these sands, our fore-
                     bearers cast out their animal 
                     passions. Here our race was 
                     saved by the first attainment of 
                     Kolinahr.
                  
                                   MALE MASTER
                     Kolinahr: the final shedding of 
                     all emotion.

                                   FEMALE MASTER
                     You have labored long, Spock.
                     Now receive from us this symbol
                     of total logic.

           Spock starts to kneel... the Female Master moves in,
           intending to put the ancient pendant around his neck. 
           But Spock now hesitates -- he's troubled as though 
           uncertain he deserves this symbol and waves the 
           pendant away. Then, a faint reprise of the V'ger THEME 
           MUSIC now causes the Female Master to look skyward. 
           She turns from this back to Spock as she exchanges a 
           look with the Male Masters.               

                                   FEMALE MASTER
                             (gestures Spock forward)
                     Come, give me your thoughts.

           She kneels with Spock -- lays her hands on his temples 
           in Vulcan mind-meld position.

                                   FEMALE MASTER
                             (continuing)
                     Our minds, Spock... One and
                     together....

           Their eyes close -- their minds meld -- then her head
           jerks slightly, her features change as her mind feels
           Spock's reactions to the V'ger consciousness. A long
           moment, then she opens her eyes, gets to her feet and
           looks down on the still kneeling Spock. Then, she
           casts aside the pendant she carries -- it falls into
           the dust.

                                   FEMALE MASTER
                             (continuing; sadly)
                     This consciousness which calls --
                     it stirs your human half, Spock?
                     You have not achieved Kolinahr --
                     Your human emotions are not fully
                     extinguished.
                            (turns to the other Masters)
                     He will not achieve his goal with
                     us. His answer lies elsewhere.

           The three Masters leave -- Spock watches them go, his
           disappointment evident even in his stoic features.

      31   MED. ANGLE ON SPOCK (M. & F.P.)                             31

           CAMERA CLOSES IN on his face as we again HEAR a frag-
           ment of V'ger THEME MUSIC -- Spock again raises his
           head and peers up into the heavens. HOLD on his face
           a moment, then...

            SHOCK CUT TO :

      32   EXT. EARTH - AN AIR TRAM - DAY (S)                          32

           gleaming silver in the sun as it streaks TOWARD THE
           CAMERA POSITION and hurtles PAST.

      33   EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - HILLTOP AIR TRAM STATION -             33
           DAY (M)

           From this vantage, we can SEE all of twenty-third
           century San Francisco stretched out before us. In
           the b.g., the familiar forms of the carefully preserved
           Golden Gate Bridge and Transamerica Pyramid Building
           serve as our only reminders that this is, indeed, San
           Francisco.

           The AIR TRAM (an anti-gravitational train flying
           several feet above the ground) DECELERATES sharply,
           settles to the ground with a whisper.

      34   EXT. TRAM STATION - CLOSE ON TRAM DOORS - DAY               34

           The doors opening, and various TRAVELERS (civilians
           and Starfleet personnel) leaving the tram, striding
           onto the platform, continuing on their respective
           ways. Among the departing throng:

      35   KIRK                                                        35

           in Admiral's uniform, grim, determined, moving through
           the throng. Now and then Starfleet officers nod re-
           spectfully; KIRK responds with detached formality; his
           mind is clearly set on something he is resolved to ac-
           complish here in headquarters -- whatever the cost.
           CAMERA WITH HIM, to:

      36   INT. AIR TRAM STATION - DAY         `                       36

           as Kirk strides into the graceful Starfleet HQ building.
           Many PEOPLE are about, civilians and uniformed person-
           nel; most of them with some air of urgency. (NOTE:
           ALIENS interspersed among them, Vulcans, blue-skinned
           Andorians, high-domed Vegans, ect.) Kirk continues on
           when suddenly he reacts, annoyed as he sees:

      37   SONAK                                                       37

           a Vulcan, Lt Commander; short, white-haired, grizzled,
           hurrying along. Kirk calls to him:

                                   KIRK
                     Commander Sonak... !

           SONAK turns with Vulcan imperturbability to face Kirk
           who steps toward him

                                   KIRK
                             (continuing)
                     You've received your appointment
                     as Enterprise Science Officer?

                                   SONAK
                             (nods)
                     Based, I am told, on your
                     recommendation, Admiral. Thank                           
                     you.

                                   KIRK
                     Why aren't you on board?

                                   SONAK
                     Captain Decker requested I complete
                     final Science briefing here before...

                                   KIRK
                             (interrupting)
                     Here at Starfleet...? The
                     Enterprise is in final preparation
                     to leave dock...

                                   SONAK
                     Which will require twenty more
                     hours at minimum, Admiral...

                                   KIRK
                     Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting
                     with Admiral Nogura which will not 
                     last more than three minutes.
                     Report to me on the Enterprise in
                     one hour.

                                   SONAK
                     To you, sir?

                                   KIRK
                     I intend to be there following 
                     that meeting. Report to me. One 
                     hour!

           And Kirk turns, strides purposefully away. Sonak gazes
           after him, one eyebrow raised quizzically.

      38   EXT. EARTH ORBIT (S)                                        38

           In f.g., Orbital drydock offices, rotating slowly but
           perceptibly against blue-black of space. Small figures
           in spacesuits working on construction, with work belts.
           Beyond and below... Earth. In the far distance we can
           barely make out an orbital drydock.

           The cluster is a fully-equipped dockyard engineering
           center and computer drafting office.

           CAMERA MOVES IN AND CENTERS ON an outer "Travel Pod."

      40   INT. INNER OFFICE (O)                                       40

           an installation which also includes a double position
           transporter, in which we SEE the TRANSPORTER EFFECT
           BEGIN. With the TRANSPORTER CREW IS SCOTT. He's with
           a Technician, busy with a piece of complex circuitry.
           Then he turns, sees that it is Kirk BEAMING in here.
           As Kirk materializes, steps off the transporter plat-
           form, Scott moves quickly to him.

     40A   KIRK AND SCOTT                                             40A

           The starship Engineering Officer clearly surprised to
           see Kirk here. Kirk has the same look of grim de-
           termination we just saw in the headquarters building.
                         
                                   SCOTT
                     Admiral, I've been hoping to see
                     you. Maybe you can get through 
                     to those thick heads in Starfleet
                     that...

                                   KIRK
                     Why aren't the Enterprise
                     transporters in operation, Mister
                     Scott?

                                   SCOTT
                     We're hoping it's only a temporary
                     problem, Admiral...

                                   KIRK
                     See that it is.
                             (moving toward pod)
                     Take me over, please.

           Scott is now eying Kirk just a little warily as he fol-
           lows him into the pod. Kirk's determined expression
           suggests that some chips are going to fly and Scott
           does not want to become one of them.

                                   SCOTT
                             (carefully)
                     Admiral, the Enterprise has just
                     finished eighteen months redesign-
                     ing and refitting. She needs 
                     testing, a shakedown...

                                   KIRK
                     Mr. Scott, there's an alien object
                     with unbelievable destructive 
                     power less than three days away 
                     from this planet...

           Kirk hits a button on the travel pod panel -- the air-
           lock doors SLAM closed behind them. Then, stepping im-
           mediately to the front observation window:

                                   KIRK
                             (continuing)
                     ... the only Starship in
                     interception range is the
                     Enterprise! Ready, or not, she
                     launches in twelve hours!

           Scott throws Kirk an appalled look but is now occupied
           in sealing the Outer Pod door and manipulating drive
           controls.

           CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK TO REVEAL front of the
           Pod and arms of the office complex as Pod disconnects
           and starts to move.

            as it moves way from the office complex. We can
           SEE the jet flames of its tiny thrusters as it cir-
           cles around, heads off (toward the distant Orbital
           dry dock).

      44   INT. TRAVEL POD - KIRK AND SCOTT                            44

           Scott nervously eying Kirk, and finally deciding to
           make one more effort:

                                   SCOTT
                     The crew hasn't had near enough
                     transition time with all the new
                     equipment. And the engines,
                     Admiral: they've yet to be even
                     tested at warp power. Add to 
                     that, an untried Captain...

                                   KIRK
                             (hint of smile)
                     Two and a half years as Chief of
                     Starfleet Operations may have
                     made me a little stale, Mr. Scott
                     -- but I wouldn't exactly consider
                     myself 'untried.'

           It takes Scott a moment to comprehend, and Kirk smiles
           now, nods:

                                   KIRK
                             (continuing)
                     They gave her back to me, Scotty.

           Scott peers at him, genuinely surprised -- and pleased.
           Then:

                                   SCOTT
                     "Gave' her back, sir...? I doubt
                     it was that easy...
                             (returns smile)
                     But any man who could manage such
                     a feat, I wouldna dare disappoint.
                     She'll launch on time, sir...
                             (with confidence)
                     And she'll be ready.

           And he clasps Kirk's elbow affectionately, then gestures
           Kirk to look out the pod window.

      45   EXT. OUTSIDE THE POD WINDOW - KIRK'S POV (O)                45

           Scott is well aware of what the Enterprise means to
           Kirk. As Scott maneuvers the pod to provide the best
           perspective, Kirk peers through the observation window,
           craning his head, hungry for his first glimpse of the
           starship. Scott is watching him, immensely pleased.

      47   PAST THEM TO THE POD WINDOW (O)                             47

           as we SEE the drydock and more of its detail, and a
           hint of what is inside.

           PAST Kirk and Scott the corner of the drydock becomes
           larger -- we begin SEEING more of it. And then the
           merest glimpse of what is inside the drydock: The
           Enterprise slips INTO VIEW.

      51   INT. POD - VERY CLOSE ON KIRK AT WINDOW                     51

           as he watches, his face reflecting all of it: the awe,
           the wonder, the romance, the obsession. The one comp-
           lete love of his life. And with that love regained,
           he is becoming more fully alive again.

           Kirk looks at Scott; for a moment both hold each other's
           eye. Scott knows precisely how Kirk feels. Both turn
           to the window again.

      52   WHAT THEY SEE - THE ENTERPRISE (S)                          52

           Now DOMINATING the SCREEN -- the awesome, symmetrical
           bulk of the starship comes fully INTO VIEW. And it
           dominates Kirk's -- and our emotions.

       -                                                                -
      56   AS IT CIRCLES - THE ANTI-LIKE FIGURES OF WORKERS (S)        56

           The great ship dwarfs everything. The drydock becomes
           a fragile filigree framing the ship's great curved
           bulk. The tiny pod continues to move along it.

           Small automated welding devices move along the gird-
           ers, working with brief, bright orange-white flares.
           In other areas of metal lace structure, supplies and
           equipment are being loaded onto the ship. The pod
           continues moving (Scott is giving Kirk time to see all),
           watched carefully by the TINY FIGURES OF SUPERVISING
           TECHNICIANS on the drydock. Now the pod moves toward
           mating position. It closes in, secures itself to the
           outer airlock.

      57   INT. POD - AT THE AIRLOCK                                   57

           Scott completing the mating procedure, Kirk turning
           from the observation window. Outside, the metallic..
           CLICK of the pod locking onto the airlock. Now the
           "WHOOSH" of the latch doors securing, the CLANG of
           security bolts. It's all been a rare and delicious
           moment for Kirk, and his face shows it.

           OVER the POD INTERCOM we HEAR, "Pod secured. Pressure
           equalized." Scott moves the control to open the hatch.

      58   INT. ENTERPRISE CARGO DECK (M)                              58

           A confusion of organized work and VOICES. The cargo
           deck bustles with activity; supplies and equipment
           being stored and installed.

      59   INT. CARGO DECK - BALCONY AND CATWALK                       59

           Kirk and Scott are met by a nervous, perspiring
           ENSIGN.

                                   KIRK AND SCOTT
                     Permission to come aboard, sir...?

                                   ENSIGN
                     Granted, sir. Welcome aboard,
                     Admiral... Commander Scott,
                     you're needed in Engineering
                     immediately.

                                   SCOTT
                             (to Kirk)
                     Sir, you'll excuse me...?

           Kirk gestures him to leave, and Scott hurries away.
           Kirk stands a moment, gazing down at the cargo deck.

      60   ANGLE DOWN PAST KIRK TO FLOOR (M)                           60

           The crew maneuvering antigravity devices which move
           heavy containers -- scrambles of activity at storage
           holds and maintenance lockers.

      61   CLOSE ON KIRK AND ENSIGN                                    61

           Kirk is drinking it all in. He's home.

                                   ENSIGN
                             (nervous)
                     Sir, if you'll follow me, I'll...

                                   KIRK
                     I think I can find my way,
                     Ensign.

           And Kirk moves off, leaving the Ensign gazing at him,
           relieved.

      62   EXT. ELEVATOR AND CATWALK                                   62

           Kirk ENTERS ANGLE and the doors snap open.

      63   INT. ELEVATOR                                               63

           as Kirk enters. The doors close. Kirk waits a beat,
           savoring this moment too. Then, firmly to the control
           panel:

                                   KIRK
                     Bridge!

           The turbo-elevator HUMS WITH POWER as it begins hur-
           tling up. On the wall back of Kirk we SEE an electronic
           diagram of the Enterprise tracking the elevator's 
           speedy trip to the Bridge.

      64   INT. BRIDGE                                                 64

           A confusion of activity and VOICES. Pieces o equip-
           ment in a state of disarray: consoles open, fiber
           optic tubes unconnected, viewing screens dismantled.
           It's a frantic, desperate scene -- a ship and crew to-
           tally unprepared. In the midst of this: ALIEN
           ensign is assisting UHURA (Lt. Comdr. stripes)deftly
           working her communications station, AD LIBBING
           "... Hailing frequency four, check. Hailing frequency
           five, will someone please check me?" At the helm,
           sweat-soaked SULU (Lt. Comdr stripes) has a service
           plate open, is peering inside to make delicate adjust-
           ments, AD LIBBING "... Helm, now give me a reading on
           four point zero zero six of full." And at the Weapons
           Control, CHEKOV (Full Lt.)argues with TECHNICIANS who
           insist photon torpedoes read "ready" while Chekov
           argues the computer is not relaying that information.

      65   ANGLE ON THE ELEVATOR DOORS                                 65

           snapping open -- and there is Kirk. For the moment no
           one notices him, and he stands watching, remembering.
           And then he moves forward toward the command center.

      66   ACROSS UHURA TO KIRK                                        66

           as she is the first to see him. She reacts,pleased.

                                   UHURA
                     Captain... Starfleet just 
                     signaled your transfer-of-
                     command orders!

      67   ANOTHER ANGLE - VARIOUS REACTION                            67

           as everyone else is suddenly aware of Kirk.

           All work stops, with various AD LIBBED greetings from
           the old crew: "Admiral Kirk..." "It's the Captain...!"
           etc., etc. But most sit or stand, simple gaping at
           Kirk, all quite awed. The old hands, Uhura, Sulu, and
           Chekov start converging on Kirk. But he gestures them
           back, speaking crisply.
                      
                                   KIRK
                     I appreciate the welcome; I wish
                     the circumstances were less
                     critical.
                             (to Uhura)
                     Epsilon Nine is monitoring the
                     intruder; keep a channel open to
                     them.
                             (glances around)
                     Where is Captain Decker?

                                   SULU
                     He's in Engineering, sir...
                             (uncomfortable,
                              indicates Captain's 
                              chair)
                     He doesn't know.

           Kirk reacts with some exasperation, starts away,
           addresses Chekov:

                                   KIRK
                     Mr Chekov, assemble the crew on
                     the Rec Deck at 0400 hours. I
                     want to show them what we're 
                     facing.

           And Kirk moves to the elevator, enters, is gone. The
           moment the elevator doors snap closed:

                                   SULU
                     I wouldn't have wanted to have
                     been standing in his way. He
                     wanted her back; he got her!

                                   ALIEN ENSIGN
                             (perturbed)
                     And Captain Decker? He's been
                     with the ship every minute of
                     her refitting...

                                   UHURA
                             (brittle)
                     Ensign -- our chances of coming
                     back from this mission in one
                     piece may have just doubled...!

      68   OMITTED                                                     68
        -                                                               -
      69                                                               69   
     
      70   INT. ENGINEERING SECTION                                    70

           The entire complex a beehive of pre-departure activity.
           ENGINEERING PERSONNEL (at least a third of them female)
           coming and going, the platform-elevators (small, one-
           man lifts to various levels) busy. A gentle but con-
           stant HUM and WHIRR flows from the engine core, to indi-
           cate a pre-idling mode. There will be continual AD
           LIBBED conversation among the Technicians.

           Now the Engine Room door opens and Kirk steps into the 
           area. He stands a moment observing the activity. a
           grizzled ENGINEERING CHIEF pushes a huge condenser on
           an anti-grav device past irk with a respectful "watch
           it, sir" admonishment. Kirk moves on to:

      71   THE INTERMIX CHAMBER                                        71

           at the middle of the power shaft. Very NOISY here,
           and a continual CACOPHONY of COMPUTERIZED AND HUMAN
           VOICES calling off equipment checks. And grouped 
           around a section of burnt-out circuitry are WILLARD
           DECKER, Captain's stripes, handsome, in his early
           30's; Scott, and two Technicians. Decker and Scott
           are working feverishly uncoupling the device, 
           probing its innards. Decker has discovered the problem,
           removed several transistor-type parts, taps them 
           with a pencil-sized sonic analyzer.

                                   DECKER
                             (quietly elated)
                     I thought so! See... the trans-
                     porter sensor was not activated...

                                   SCOTT
                             (impressed)
                     Aye, you were dead right about
                     that...
                             (to Technician)
                     Clearly, put a back-up sensor into
                     the unit.

      72   ACROSS THEM TO KIRK                                         72

           as the Technician prepares to install the device,
           Scott glances up to see Kirk.

           He looks from Decker to Kirk in acute embarrassment
           (so that we should realize Scott hasn't mentioned
           Kirk's taking over to Decker). Decker now notices
           Kirk, reacts pleased.

                                   DECKER
                     Admiral Kirk...
                             (shakes Kirk's hand)
                     We're getting a top brass send
                     off...?
                             (self assured grin)
                     She'll launch on schedule if we
                     have to tow her out with our bare
                     hands. Right, Scotty?

                                   SCOTTY
                             (lamely)
                     Aye, sir, that we will...

                                   KIRK
                             (to Decker)
                     Will, let's go over here and
                     talk.

           He indicates corner. Decker glances bemusedly at
           Kirk, then turns to Scott:

                                   DECKER
                     Let me now when the back-up is 
                     in place.

      73   ACROSS SCOTT TO KIRK AND DECKER                             73

           as Scott AD LIBS a glum "Aye, sir," and watches them
           walk across the Chamber.

      74   A CORNER OF THE INTERMIX CHAMBER                            74

           just a little quieter here, with Kirk and Decker arriv-
           ing, and Decker saying blithely:

                                   DECKER
                     All due respect, sir, I hope
                     this isn't a Starfleet pep talk;
                     I'm just too busy.

           Kirk eyes Decker -- then decides the best way to say
           it is plainly, directly.

                                   KIRK
                     I'm taking over the Center seat. 
                     I'm sorry, Will.

                                   DECKER
                     You are what...?

                                   KIRK
                     I'm replacing you as Captain of
                     the Enterprise.

           Decker seems shocked into silence; he can only peer
           at Kirk who reaches tentatively as though to clasp a
           paternal hand on Decker's shoulder, then withdraws it
           and continues quickly.

                                   KIRK
                             (continuing)
                     You'll stay aboard as Executive
                     Officer... a temporary grade
                     reduction to Commander.

                                   DECKER
                            (finding his voice)
                     -- You, personally, are assuming
                     command?

                                   KIRK
                     Yes.

                                   DECKER
                     May I ask Why?

                                   KIRK
                             (nods)
                     My experience -- five years out
                     there dealing with unknowns like
                     this -- my familiarity with the
                     Enterprise, this crew...

                                   DECKER
                     Admiral, this is an almost totally
                     new enterprise. You don't know
                     her a tenth as well as I do.

      75   ANOTHER ANGLE - TO SHOW SCOTT IN B.G. (ACROSS THE           75
           ROOM)

           Scott, working on the relay, but continually glancing
           at Kirk and Decker with worried concern, as Kirk
           replies:

                                   KIRK
                     That's why you're staying aboard.
                     I'm sorry, Will.

                                   DECKER
                     No, Admiral. I don't think you are;
                     not one damned bit. I remember
                     when you recommended me for this
                     command. You told me how envious
                     you were, and if only you could
                     find a way to get a starship
                     command again. Well, sir, it looks
                     like you found a way.

           Kirk is silent a moment, peering levelly at Decker,
           who returns the gaze with equal intensity. Then:

                                   KIRK
                     Report to the bridge, Commander.
                     Immediately.

           Decker EXITS. Kirk waits, collecting his composure
           as he watches him go. Then Kirk turns to glare at
           Scott. Interrupted by a flare as something shorts
           out at the mechanism where Scott and Decker had been
           working. Technician (Clearly) reacts, hits an inter-
           com button fast:

                                   TECHNICIAN (CLEARY)
                     Transporter room, come in!
                     Urgent!
                             (to Scott)
                     Redline on the transporters,
                     Mister Scott!

           Scott whirls to a console fast, speaks urgently!

                                   SCOTT
                     Transporter room, do not engage!
                     Do not....

                                   TECHNICIAN (CLEARY)
                             (reacting to the reading;
                              interruption)
                     Too late; they're beaming now!

           Kirk is exiting on a run, followed by Scott.

      76   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - INCLUDING TRANSPORTER CHAMBER       76
           (O)

           An unusually defective looking TRANSPORTER EFFECT in
           progress, alternately flashing and glowing -- even the
           Transporter SOUND seems wrong, as if struggling to
           overcome some problem. At the console, CHIEF RAND and
           ASSISTANT are reacting in surprised, near-horror as
           they attempt vainly to save the situation.

                                   RAND
                             (into intercom)
                     Starfleet, override us!
                     OVERRIDE...! Yank them back!

           Suddenly, from Rand's console,a VIOLENT GLARE -- a
           PROTESTING SOUND from the circuitry. And on the con-
           sole a red-warning light now begins flashing.

                                   STARFLEET VOICE
                     Unable to retrieve their pattern,
                     Enterprise....!

           Rand reacts in real horror now as human forms begin to
           FAINTLY MATERIALIZE, then FADE AWAY, then REAPPEAR IN
           FAINTLY MISSHAPEN FORM as she frantically works con-
           trols. Kirk ENTERS fast, steps to the console to
           assist Rand; Scott has also come in and moves to the
           console, brushes aside the Asst. Chief, and begins
           manipulating the additional controls himself.

                                   SCOTT
                     We're losing the pattern...!

                                   KIRK
                             (into intercom)
                     Starfleet, boost your matter gain; 
                     we need more signal!

                                   RAND
                     Oh, no! They're forming!

      77   CLOSER ON THE TRANSPORTER CHAMBER (O)                       77

           with the human forms FLUTTERING INTO FULLER AND FULLER
           MATERIALIZATION, FRIGHTENINGLY, HORRIBLY MISSHAPEN. We
           RECOGNIZE one form as the Vulcan, Sonak -- the other a
           human WOMAN. They MATERIALIZE; we HEAR A MOAN form 
           from the Vulcan -- the Woman's SCREAM OF PAIN. Then,
           all at once, the half-materialized bodies are gone;
           the transporter chamber is empty.

                                   KIRK
                     Oh, my God...!

      78   KIRK, SCOTT AND RAND                                        78

           gazing, horrified, at the empty chamber.

                                   KIRK
                             (into intercom)
                     Starfleet, do you have them?

           A mutter of utter, vacant silence -- and Kirk and
           Scott look at each other again, their pained faces
           presaging the answer they already know:

                                   STARFLEET VOICE
                             (shaken)
                     Enterprise... what we got back
                     didn't live long. Fortunately.

           Another moment of stunned silence, and then Kirk hits
           the transmission button -- fighting to control his
           voice as:

                                   KIRK
                     Starfleet... Kirk. Please...
                     express my condolences to their
                     families. Commander Sonak's
                     can be reached through the Vulcan
                     Embassy.
                             (see Rand's stricken
                              expression)
                     There was nothing you could have
                     done, Rand. It wasn't your fault.

           And before Rand can answer, Kirk leaves the room.

      79   INT. CORRIDOR - TRAVELING WITH KIRK                         79

           as Kirk steps out, and the doors snap closed behind
           him. In the corridor the furor of the hurried depar-
           ture is, as everywhere, quite evident: CREW MEMBERS
           move back and forth. But Kirk does not see them; his
           mind is tormented by the transporter accident -- was
           there something he should have done, could have done,
           to prevent it? Should he launch on schedule with the
           starship this unready? Has he done right in yielding
           to this terrible needs for starship command again,
           forcing Starfleet to give her to him? Would Decker's
           knowledge of the new design have prevented the acci-
           dent?

           Kirk reaches a corridor intersection, looks around,
           realizes he's lost track of where he is. A passing
           YEOMAN stops in response to his puzzled expression.

                                   KIRK
                     Turboshaft eight...?

                                   YEOMAN
                     Back that way, sir.

           She's indicating back the direction from which Kirk
           came. He nods his thanks, turns and moves back down
           the corridor.

      80   DECKER                                                      80

           hurrying down the corridor. The two face each other
           a silent moment, Decker studying Kirk curiously.

                                   KIRK
                     We'll have to replace Commander
                     Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan
                     there, if possible...

                                   DECKER
                     None available, Captain. There's
                     no one in fact, who's fully rated
                     on this design.

                                   KIRK
                     You are, Mister Decker. I'm
                     afraid you'll have to double as
                     Science Officer.

            And Kirk moves on, Decker stands gazing reflectively
            after him.

           (AS SEEN ON VIEWER) (O)
     
           (in the last part of the scene which showed the Klingon
           Captain speaking in Klingonese and an English print-
           out interpretation appearing at the screen bottom.
           The Klingon ship nearly totaled; one engine nacelle
           gone, smoke and flame spewing from the other, etc.
           And then that final WHIPLASH ENERGY BOLT STRIKING AND
           SPECTACULARLY DESTROYING THE SHIP, etc.)

           But this time, O.S., we HEAR GASPS of incredulity from
           many throats (an audience), and various AD LIBBED com-
           ments: "My God...!" "I don't believe it...!" "What
           could it be...?" Etc., etc.

           And then, immediately following this, on the viewer:

      86   THE LUMINESCENT CLOUD (AS SEEN ON A VIEWER) (O)             86

           (as in earlier Epsilon 9 viewer -- but with no music,
           only more AD LIBBED exclamations from an audience.)
           The viewer goes blank.

      87   INT. RECREATION DECK (M)                                    87

           We SEE that all this was being viewed by the CREW
           MEMBERS (Aliens included) assembled on the Rec Deck.

           The Recreation Deck is one of the largest areas on
           the ship, several deck levels high, a part of one
           wall consisting of picture windows, through which can
           be seen sections of the drydock structure outside.

           On another wall is a large viewer, on which was just
           shown the Klingon transmission. Leading off and away
           from this deck area are what are obviously other
           specific recreation areas -- gymnasiums, food centers,
           game rooms, lounges, etc.

      88   ANOTHER ANGLE OF THE RED DECK - HIGHER LEVEL                88

           as the Crew Members chat in low, grim tones -- Kirk
           (now with Captain's stripes) appears. As he comes
           into view, the two hundred or so crew below go silent.
           Kirk grimly indicates the now blank viewer:

                                   KIRK
                     That's all we know about it;
                     except that it's now 2.2 days
                     from Earth. Enterprise is the
                     only Federation starship that
                     stands in its way.

      89   ANOTHER ANGLE - CREW REACTIONS                              89

           as the CAMERA FINDS various faces: human, alien; most
           young, all intelligent, forthright -- anxious. Kirk
           has paused a moment, now continues.

                                   KIRK (O.S.)
                     We assume there is a vessel of
                     some type at the heart of the
                     cloud. Our orders are to intercept,
                     investigate; and take whatever action
                     is necessary... and possible.
                             (beat)
                     ...We can only hope that the
                     life form aboard that vessel
                     reasons as we do.

      90   ANGLE ON UHURA                                              90

           standing near an intercom, which just then has emitted
           a bosun's WHISTLE intercom signal.

                                   BRIDGE VOICE

           Kirk leans over to the intercom, speaks into it:

                                   KIRK
                     Put it on the viewer here...!

      91   ON THE REC DECK VIEWER (O)                                  91

           as all eyes turn to the viewer which fades into a view
           of Commander Branch, in the Epsilon 9 monitor room.
           Branch is tense, reflecting extreme urgency. Near
           Branch, working intently at the console are the Female
           Lieutenant and a Technician.

                                   BRANCH
                             (from the viewer;
                              checking console
                              readings)

                     Definitely something inside..

                     Receiving an odd pattern now..
                             (toward Branch)
                     They seem to be reacting to
                     our scans, sir.

                                   BRANCH
                             (inspecting another
                              console)
                      Some kind of energy surge...
                             (looking up)
                      Enterprise... they could be
                      mistaking our scans as a
                      hostile act...
                             (reacts at readings)
                      Deflectors, emergency full!

           Branch hits an alarm button; we HEAR ALARM KLAXON
           SOUNDING. The viewer IMAGE DISTORTS, clears again
           while Branch -- facing his viewer, continues urgently:

                                   BRANCH
                             (continuing)
                     We are under attack...!

                                   KIRK
                             (to Uhura)
                     External view...!

      92   ON THE VIEWER - EXT. THE DESTRUCTION OF EPSILON 9 (O)       92

           as the image of Branch is immediately replaced by an
           external view of the plantoid, and the LUMINESCENT
           CLOUD (at about the same distance from which the
           Klingon cruisers were attacked).

           Then it STRIKES the plantoid WITH FULL, CATACLYSMIC                
           FORCE. The viewer IMAGE BREAKS UP -- and immediately
           the entire Starfleet base becomes a maelstrom of FLAR-
           ING ENERGY, shattered structure, flying debris. And
           then, all at once, there is nothing -- empty space,
           Epsilon 9 is gone. We SEE only the stars; and the
           mysterious LUMINESCENT CLOUD moving across the distant
           sky.

           (NOTE: The above is entirely SILENT, and when it is
           finished, not a word is spoken.)

                                   KIRK (O.S.)

           as the viewer goes blank, all still facing the screen.
           Then Kirk turns to the room as if to comment. Then he
           stops -- nothing he can say will add at all to what
           they've just seen. Instead:

           The scene they have just witnessed still vivid in their
           minds as they gaze somberly up toward Kirk who is exit-
           ing. The bridge crew follows him out. Not a word is 
           said as the remainder of the crew waits another moment,
           then begins to disperse toward their duty stations too.

           LOOMS HUGE. The dock welders are gone; the supply pods
           float away from the ship. Little tongues of blue flame
           spurt from the ship's maneuvering jets.

      96   CLOSER - ON ENTERPRISE (S)                                  96

           as the large dock umbilical is released, floats free of
           its starship attachment. Dock departure is imminent.

           Kirk in the center seat, intently studying the Naviga-
           tion console in front of him (at the Navigator's

           as Decker (now wearing Commander stripes) reacts,
           almost startled, and Uhura continues:

                                   UHURA
                     She's a Deltan.

           Uhura's tone and expression convey "Deltan" in a
           certain, special manner.

                            (reprovingly)
                     And there are no finer navigators
                     in Starfleet, Commander.

           The last is interrupted by:

     98A   ANGLE ON THE ELEVATOR DOORS                                98A

           as they snap open, and there emerges a breathtakingly
           beautiful young woman (uniformed as a Navigator Lieu-
           tenant) who strides purposefully onto the bridge. A
           stunning figure, but hairless, entirely bald but or
           delicate eyebrows and eyelashes. Her bald head is not 
           at all unattractive, in fact exudes an aura of sensual
           nudity. Indeed, her whole being exudes sensuality.
           (This is a racial characteristic, not a deliberate
           presence.) She approaches Kirk

           (NOTE: Throughout this sequence, Sulu eyes ILIA with
           unrestrained admiration.)

      99   ACROSS ILIA TO DECKER                                       99

           as Ilia starts to speak, suddenly stops: she has just
           then noticed Decker, who has stepped from his station
           to face her. For an electronic moment their eyes meet,
           hold in unquestioned recognition.

                                   DECKER
                     Hello, Ilia.

                                   ILIA
                            (surprised)
                     Decker....!

           Kirk has observed this with surprise and some concern
           (it presages possible complications). Decker turns to
           Kirk, slightly uncomfortable at this.
                               
                                   DECKER
                     I was stationed on the Lieutenant's
                     home planet some years ago...

           Ilia looks from Kirk back to Decker, puzzled at his
           sleeve stripes.

                                   ILIA
                             (eyes his rank

                     Captain Kirk has the utmost
                     confidence in me.

           Kirk flashes a hard glance at Decker, then toward
           Ilia too.

                                   KIRK
                             (pointedly)

                     My oath of celibacy is on record
                     Captain. May I assume my duties?

           While respectful, her tone of voice has been just as
           firm as Kirk's.

                                   KIRK
                     By all means.

     100   ACROSS KIRK TO UHURA                                       100

           receiving a message, now relaying it.

                                   UHURA
                     Captain, Starfleet reports our
                     last six crew members ready to
                     beam up...
                             (puzzled)
                     ... but one of them is refusing
                     to step into the transporter.

           Just as Kirk a moment before was tense, now suddenly
           he's relaxed again; he rises.

                                   KIRK
                             (pleased)
                     Oh? I'll see that he beams up...!

           And he hurries from the bridge, onto the elevator, is
           gone. A moment of puzzled silence, then:
           
                                   DECKER
                     Mr. Sulu, take Lieutenant Ilia
                     in hand.

                                   SULU
                             (startled)
                     Sir...?
                            (then understands)
                     Yes, of course...
                             (to Ilia)
                     Your pre-programming is already
                     set in, Lieutenant.

           Sulu has almost tripped getting out of his chair. He
           starts offering Ilia his hand, then thinks better of
           it, withdraws it abruptly, immediately busies himself
           punching out equations on her console... AD LIBS,
           "It's all on the computer. You'll have no problem..."
           Sulu is nervous, fluttery around this lovely creature --
           now hits a wrong switch. Produces a BEEPING SOUND which
           he fumbles to shut off. She smiles; speaks quietly,
           repeats:

                                   ILIA
                     I'm sworn to celibacy, Mister
                     Sulu. That makes me as safe
                     as any human female.

           Sulu catches her eye but before he can reply, Decker has
           moved in beside Ilia.

                                   DECKER
                     I now the Captain meant no person-
                     al insult.

                             (eyes on console)
                     I would never take advantage of
                     a sexually immature species.
                             (looks at him)
                     You can assure him that's true,
                     can't you?

           Clearly, the remark carries special, personal
           significance.

           Kirk entering as Rand and her assistant electronically
           list the last of the five arrivals who are leaving the
           Transporter Chamber. Kirk calls through intercom to
           the last arrival, a young female Yeoman.

                                   KIRK
                     Yeoman, what was the problem

                     Said something about first seeing
                     how it scrambled our molecules.

                     Well, for a man who swore he'd
                     never return to Starfleet...

                             (flat, tight)
                     What happened, Captain, sir, was
                     that your revered Admiral Nogura
                     invoked a little known -- and
                     seldom used -- reserve activation
                     clause...
                             (snaps)
                     ... in simpler language, Captain,

           Kirk has offered his hand, but McCoy is already flaring:

                                   McCOY
                     This was your idea! It was
                     your idea, wasn't it!

                     -- Why is any object we don't
                     understand called a 'thing'?

                                   KIRK
                             (continues)

                                   McCOY
                     Were you behind this?

                     Bones, I need you badly.

           Kirk extends his hand again; McCoy delays some moments
           -- then finally responds. And once done, it is the long
           hand clasp of two old friends reunited despite their
           differences. Now McCoy turns to Rand.

                                   McCOY
                     Permission to come aboard, sir?

           And McCoy moves toward the door, grumbling:

                     I hear Chapel's an MD now; I
                     need a top nurse, not a doctor
                     who'll argue every diagnosis...
                     And --

           Even when he's in the corridor his grumbling trails
           after him.

                                   McCOY
                             (continuing)

           Here in Engineering Section, the ENGINE THROBBING
           SLOWLY BUILDS to a THUNDERING SOUND. A glow from

           great engines draw more and more power.

           he's awaited, and to him it is equally as sensuous
           and gratifying as making love -- which, perhaps, he
           is -- to his mistress: The Enterprise.

           as they open, and McCoy appears, walks over to Kirk
           who swings his chair around to face him. McCoy is
           his usual dour self.

                                   KIRK

                                   McCOY
                     They do not. It's like working
                     in a damned computer center.

           Decker calls:

                             (continuing)

           McCoy is watching Kirk, a bit surprised at his abrupt-
           ness to Decker.

                     You're pushing Jim. Your people
                     know their jobs.

           Kirk flashes McCoy a glance of annoyance -- then back
           to using intercom:

           The main intermix chambers GLOWING with power; the LOW
           RUMBLE of the main engines coming to life.

           The CAMERA FINDS Scott in the chamber:

           He steps to his console where an ASST. ENGINEER is
           working a computer, studying the readouts, punching
           buttons, etc. Scott stands over him, grimly observ-
           ing. Finally, the Asst. simply shrugs with frustration.

           McCoy still watches curiously as Kirk turns to the
           helm:

           Sulu moves his controls forward -- everyone waits
           tensely -- and then we HEAR THE INCREASING THROB OF

           We SEE the WARP POWER EFFECT build up between the en-
           gine "nacelles" -- then the starship makes the QUANTUM
           LEAP into warp drive. The stars ahead shift, streak,
           colors pulsating and changing as the shift exceeds the
           wave lengths of the light spectrum -- and the stars
           congeal into a MASS ahead.

           Kirk never finishes the word. At that instant, on the
           viewer, a WORMHOLE DISTORTION: a sudden SPIRALING OF
           STARS AND FLUID LIGHT narrowing into a VORTEX into

           as the starship's photon torpedo tubes EJECT GLOWING
           BALLS OF LIGHT ENERGY, which seems to float toward the
           oncoming asteroid, almost too slowly. And in these
           brief seconds, the asteroid hurtles at the Enterprise,
           the huge pitted rock growing even larger than the ship
           itself. It FILLS THE SCREEN, as the photon torpedoes
           hit, disintegrating the asteroid into thousands of
           fragments. Instantly, these fragments pulverize them-
           selves on the ship's forward forcefield and deflector
           screens. The smaller pieces burn up on impact, clearly
           outlining the ship's forcefield barriers.

           The asteroid fragments still smashing into the force
           field screen; the smaller bits like SPARKLERS as im-
           pact heat consumes them. The larger sections bouncing 
           away, the bridge QUIVERING as they hit.

           Then one final gigantic fragment strikes, the bridge
           SHUDDERS. And then the viewer shows only the normal
           SUB-WARP EFFECT: The stars ahead, relatively station-
           ary; a feeling of motion, but smooth, visually normal.

           with Scott and his crew pouring over the instruments --
           all seem very grim. Scott, quite preoccupied, now
           speaks into the intercom.

           Kirk seeming to collect his thoughts now -- he gives
           Decker a look, uses the intercom himself:

                     We're doing our best.

           as Kirk flips off the intercom, rises determinedly,
           faces Decker:

                                   KIRK
                     Mr. Decker, I'd like to see you

                             (toward helm)

                             (to Kirk)
                     Mind if I tag along?

           Kirk gives McCoy an annoyed look, then strides to the
           elevator. Decker, grim, follows -- McCoy brings up
           the rear as they EXIT.

                             (continuing; gently

           And she punches in some equations, then again peers
           up at the doors where she last saw Decker. She is
           very concerned.

           The doors opening, Kirk entering, McCoy moves to b.g.
           while Decker stands attentively, waiting as Kirk
           turns to him.

                                   KIRK
                     Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was
                     my phaser order countermanded?

                                   DECKER
                            (cool, polite)
                     Sir, the Enterprise redesign
                     increases phaser power by
                     channeling it through the main
                     engines. When they went into
                     anti-matter imbalance, the
                     phasers were automatically cut
                     off.

           Kirk is surprised by this information, perhaps slight-
           ly chagrined. After a beat:

                                   KIRK
                     Then you acted properly, of course.

                     Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar-
                     rassed you.

                     You saved the ship.

                     Sir, you haven't logged a single
                     star hour in two and a half years.
                     That, plus your unfamiliarity
                     with the ship's design -- in my
                     opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes 
                     our mission.                          

           Kirk reacts with anger. Struggles for and regains
           control.

                                   KIRK
                     I trust you will... nursemaid me
                     through these difficulties, Mister?

                                   DECKER
                     Yes, sir, I'll do that.

           Kirk peers at Decker, who stands facing him 
           determinedly.

                                   KIRK
                     Then I won't keep you from your
                     duties any longer, Commander.
                             (whirling at McCoy)
                     Yes, Doctor?

           Kirk's last line has drowned out Decker's "Aye, sir."
           McCoy says nothing, waits until Decker is gone and the
           door closes behind him. Then:

                                   McCOY

           Decker moving toward an elevator -- the elevator doors
           open, and there is Ilia. She steps out, faces him.

           Ilia whirls, moves toward her stateroom door, which
           snaps open, then closes behind her. Decker stands
           gazing at the door, remembering, regretful.

           Kirk's expression hardens.

                     Make your point, Doctor.

                     book short of blackmail to get
                     the Enterprise -- maybe even
                     that. And when this mission is
                     over, you have no intention of
                     giving her back.

                     It's an obsession -- that can
                     blind you so far more immediate
                     -- and critical responsibilities.
                     Your reaction to Decker is an
                     example.

           Kirk studies him a beat; has McCoy touched a nerve?
           Something Kirk himself might have been unaware of?

           Viewer IMAGE FADES. Kirk turns back to McCoy whose
           question of Kirk's fitness still hangs there between
           them. Eye to eye - then, finally:

                                   KIRK
                             (continuing)
                     Your... opinion has been noted,
                     Doctor.
                             (beat)
                     Is there anything further?

                                   McCOY
                     I hope not.

           Kirk nods, exits. McCoy watches him go, hoping his
           point has gotten through.

           traveling at a rapid speed; it carries warp-capacity
           nacelles which dwarf the smaller  to 10 position
           shuttle fuselage. The CAMERA HOLD ON THE SHUTTLE
           as it overtakes the Enterprise, the ENTERPRISE COM-
           ING INTO VIEW, and the shuttle slowing and beginning
           to move between the starship's giant nacelles.

     147   EXT. SPACE - THROUGH WINDOW IN OFFICERS' LOUNGE -          147
           THE ENTERPRISE AND THE SHUTTLE (S)

           About the size of a fighter airplane floating in over
           the vastness of an aircraft carrier. The shuttle
           slows further, hovering now. Then its fuselage pod
           detaches from the warp drive nacelles -- the pod
           moving slowly but precisely toward the starship's
           command airlock.

     148   INT. POD HATCH ENTRY AREA                                  148

           as we HEAR the CLANK and WHOOSH of the AIRLOCK MECHAN-
           ISM. Chekov is standing by  with a security man.

           A moment later the hatch slips open - TO REVEAL
           Spock. A proud Spock, impassively Vulcan, almost
           contemptuously aloof. His hair is now trimmed in
           neat Vulcan style; he wears Vulcan attire simple,
           civilian, utilitarian.)

                                   SPOCK
                     Permission to come aboard, sir?

                                   CHEKOV
                     Granted, sir! Granted!

           Spock is already moving out of the pod entry area, im-
           passive, no greeting on his lips; no friendship in his
           expression.

           The elevator doors open, and there is Spock. It takes
           everyone a moment to believe their eyes. Then, the
           Bridge crew AD LIB their surprise and pleasure.

                                   KIRK
                     Spock...! Spock, where...how...?

           Kirk, smiling, is moving toward Spock with hand out-
           stretched. But Spock has already turned and moved
           toward the science console where Decker sits.

                                   SPOCK
                     Commander, if I may...?

     150A  AT SCIENCE CONSOLE                                        150A

           It takes Decker a moment to realize that Spock wants
           to take over the console. He begins getting to his
           feet, throwing Kirk a look. But Kirk's attention is
           totally on SPOCK. And Spock is already intent on com-
           putations he is beginning to punch into the science
           console computer.

                                   SPOCK
                     I have been monitoring your
                     Starfleet transmissions, Captain,
                     your engine design difficulties.

           Spock continues to punch information into the science
           computer -- a monitor screen IMAGE begins to show com-
           plex equations which Spock inspects -- he makes a
           further computer punch out and inspects a second  monitor 
           IMAGE of other equations. Only then does Spock seem to
           become aware of Kirk and Decker standing there with
           questioning expressions.

                                   SPOCK
                             (continuing)
                     I offer my services as Science
                     Officer.

           Kirk starts to grin -- then remembers to wipe it off
           his face as he turns to Decker.

                                   KIRK
                     If our Executive Officer has no
                     objections...?

                                   DECKER
                             (interrupting)
                     Of course not. I'm aware of
                     Mister Spock's qualifications.

                                   KIRK
                             (grinning openly now;
                              turns, calls)
                     Mister Chekov, log Mister Spock's
                     Starfleet commission reactivated;
                     list him as Science Officer; both
                     effective immediately.

       151   ANGLE TO INCLUDE ELEVATOR DOORS                             151

           as they SNAP open -- McCoy and Chapel appear. Chapel
           sees Spock at the science console -- she moves in
           quickly, overjoyed. Even McCoy seems pleased.

                                   CHAPEL
                     Mr. Spock...!!!

                                   McCOY
                     So help me, I'm actually
                     pleased to see you.

           But as Chapel crosses to Spock, her pleased smile
           brightening her whole face, Spock turns, dismisses her
           presence with a cold disinterested glance -- Chapel
           stops, stands dumbfounded. Spock gives McCoy a similar
           glance - turns back to his console readings as:

                                   UHURA
                     That's how we all feel, Mister...

           The same cold glance causes Uhura to stop in mid-
           sentence. Several grins directed toward Spock are now
           fading from bridge crew faces. Spock has turned back
           again for a last quick reading at the console and now
           stands -- totally ignoring everyone else as he speaks
           coolly, unemotionally to Kirk:
     
                                   SPOCK
                     With your permission, I will now
                     discuss these fuel equations with
                     the Engineer.

           Kirk manages a nod, a bit dumbfounded himself at Spock's
           strange manner. Spock heads for the elevator -- puz-
           zled expressions from the entire bridge crew. Then
           Kirk calls after him, very sincerely:

                                   KIRK
                     Mister Spock, welcome aboard!

           Spock continues onto the elevator without any acknow-
           ledgment, leaves. Kirk glances, perplexed, at McCoy.
           McCoy, equally perplexed, shrugs.

                                   McCOY
                     Never look a gift Vulcan in the
                     ears, Jim.

           myriad of stars, space, the whole magnificent vista.
           In the lounge, empty but for them, are Kirk and McCoy
           -- obviously awaiting Spock, who ENTERS and presents
           himself cold and aloof as before:

                                   SPOCK
                     Reporting as ordered, Captain.

                                   KIRK
                     Sit down, please.

           Spock remains standing, addresses Kirk:

                                   SPOCK
                     Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy
                     absenting himself from this
                     interview.

                                   KIRK
                     I want him here.
                            (indicating)
                     Sit down!
     
           For an instant, it looks like Spock will refuse. Then,
           he complies but sits formally, rigidly. He ignores
           McCoy totally.

                                   KIRK
                     You've reported that you felt
                     strong thought emotions. A
                     group of minds from a space
                     vessel? Could you make out any
                     plan, anything to do with
                     Earth?

                                   SPOCK
                             (still formally)
                     Negative, Captain. I could sense
                     only what seemed an almost
                     omniscient pattern of perfect
                     logic. I can explain nothing
                     more; I understand nothing more.

           Kirk is clearly disappointed -- and a bit uncomfortable
           about what he must ask next. He exchanges a glance
           with McCoy, then:

                                   KIRK
                     Also -- there was nothing in your
                     report about why you're here.

                                   SPOCK
                     That inquiry invades my personal
                     life, Captain.

                                   McCOY
                     Spock, we've already guessed why
                     you're here...

                                   KIRK
                     I inquired about you -- learned
                     you were studying with the
                     Masters...

           Although Spock has been almost infuriatingly emotionless,
           his expression shifts slightly. McCoy indicates this:

                                   McCOY
                     That flicker of emotion confirms
                     our guess. You failed.
     
                                   SPOCK
                             (facing McCoy for
                              the first time)
                     Your deductions do you credit,
                     Doctor... if your puerile
                     curiosity does not.

                                   McCOY
                             (not in amusement)
                     And now, anger, Spock?

           Spock looks straight ahead -- his face instantly com-
           posed to almost total blankness.

                                   SPOCK
                             (beat; nods)
                     I still contain fragments of my
                     human half.
     
                                   KIRK
                     And whatever you sensed out here....

                                   SPOCK
                      ... is my only hope of accomplishing
                     what the Masters could not.

                                   McCOY
                     If you achieve perfect logic, Spock,
                     you'll pay a price. It's given
                     your planet ten thousand years of
                     peace, but no poetry's been written
                     since then, no music.

           Spock has come to his feet fast - but Kirk is on his
           feet too, confronting him. During which:

                                   KIRK
                     Let it drop, Bones.

                     expect an immediate report on

                     from here on.

                     For me too. Thank you.

           The Cloud has now grown so large it DOMINATES THE
           ENTIRE VIEWER. Sulu hits a button, reducing magnif-
           cation. Immediately, the CLOUD diminishes in size --
           but almost instantly begins GROWING AGAIN. Decker's
           annoyance (with Kirk) suddenly seems to dissipate as
           his total attention is diverted to the cloud.

                     That measures twelve power?
                     Ten thousands of starships couldn't 
                     generate that much...
     
           Decker trails his words, realizing that Spock isn't
           hearing a word. Spock's attention is on the O.S. main
           viewer, totally absorbed by something he's feeling.
           He is slowly rising from his seat, stepping forward --
           Kirk becomes conscious of this, turns and sees Spock's
           strange expression. Before he can speak:

                                   SPOCK
                     They have... they have been

                     Communicated with us how?

           Spock shakes his head... then reacts as if sensing or
           theorizing something further. He turns, moves quickly
           to his console, begins there as if searching for something.

           closer and closer -- heading straight-on for the Star-
           ship. From the Bridge a CACOPHONY OF VOICES AND
           SOUNDS, but all organized and disciplined with the
           BRIDGE LIGHTING DIMMING and then as though traveling 
           the last short distance (actually several million
           miles) in the wink of an eye -- the WHIPLASH OF ENERGY
           STRIKES. The bridge lights go out.

           In the sudden darkness, the main viewer is all at once 
           a frantic, furious, pattern of GREEN-WHITE FLARING ENERGY,
           accompanied by an EXPLOSIVE SHRILLING SOUND. It seems to 
           cling to the forcefields, the incredible energy of the          
           forcefield barriers.

           Chekov's console -- a LASH of FLAME engulfs Chekov's
           arm. Automatic fire control nozzles SPURT FOAM over
           him as he falls twisting and groaning in pain. Ilia
           reacts first, crossing quickly to assist Chekov --
           Decker joins her, taking over Chekov's console.

           too, the forcefield screens and deflectors -- batter-

           penetrate.)

           Chekov's pain begins to quickly recede and he is almost
           startled by the sudden relief. Doctor Chapel, now
           spraying plasti-skin on the burned hand and wrist,

           oscillating waves, and HEAR more of the SHRILL BEEPS as 
           Spock manipulates his equipment, and continues:

                     Our... 'insignificance'?

           All have reacted to this; Kirk exchanges a look with
           Spock who nods firmly. Then Kirk sees that both Decker
           and Sulu are throwing him a questioning look. In b.g.
           McCoy and Chapel have EXITED bridge with Chekov.

                                   SPOCK
                     We are obviously confronted by
                     a highly advanced mentality...
                     yet they cannot understand who
                     we are, or what we want.

                     they broke off the attack.

                     They may have attacked only as
                     a warning to us, Captain. To
                     keep away.

                                   SPOCK
                     That would presuppose a feeling,
                     Commander... compassion. I sensed
                     no emotion, only...
                             (reverentially)
                     ... pure logic.

           Kirk peers at Spock hoping for some assistance on
           the decision; but Spock merely peers back at him ex-
           pressionlessly: the decision is Kirk's. Kirk faces
           Spock one last beat, then turns and starts back to-
           ward his chair, calling to Ilia.

           peering in momentary concentration at the viewer,
           feels Kirk's gaze -- and turns to him, again expres-

           Concern reflected on the faces of others too. Kirk

           CAMERA TRAVELING WITH ENTERPRISE as it moves on a
           parallel--closing course -- Alien continues to GROW
           IN SIZE. Although it already seems an impossibly
           large vessel compared to the Enterprise, in reality
           they are still tens of thousands of kilometers apart;
           the incredible size of the Alien is nowhere near being
           realized yet.

           Tension high as -- the Alien now appears so close that
           its IMAGE MORE THAN FILLS VIEWER. Considerable
           tension of bridge -- crew members, throwing nervous
           looks from viewer to Kirk. How much closer?!

           The Alien Object appears A DOZEN TIMES LARGER THAN
           ENTERRISE and still GROWING IN SIZE.

           We begin to SEE Alien exterior detailing which had
           not even been suspected at a longer distance.

           The Enterprise is now quartering in toward the
           Intruder, coming closer and closer. The Alien
           vessel is still GROWING IN SIZE -- more and more,
           its exterior appears to be made of substances never
           before seen by a human eye -- substances considered
           possible only in the wildest flights of scientific
           theory -- plasma-matter, energy fields diamond--hard
           in their power, solid sheets of subatomic particles,
           crystalline-lace patterns which seem capable of
           shifting their nature and rearranging themselves.

       205A   ANGLE ON INTRUDER                                         205A

           This time, the Enterprise travels on away from us, as
           its course takes it angling nearer and nearer the
           gigantic Alien Intruder -- the Starship dwindling in
           size, growing smaller, smaller, smaller... until it
           is a tiny dot compared to the enormity of the Alien
           vessel.

     206   INT. BRIDGE - VIEWER (O)                                   206

           We are coming alongside the mid-section of the Alien
           vessel, now so huge that only a small section of it
           now completely fills main viewer frame.

           Kirk's voice is blotted out by a DEAFENING, SHRILL-
           ING SOUND, accompanied by a multi-hued point of LIGHT
           which EXPLODES into BLINDING INTENSITY, obscuring
           everything for an instant. Overlapping this action,
           we HEAR:

           The BLINDING LIGHT FADES and in its lace we SEE a
           strange "entity" shocking us with its frightening
           appearance and its ugly-sounding THROBBING HUM of
           power. It is about seven feet tall and resembles a
           "blob" of raw energy in shifting patterns and colors
           of deep, ugly hues of upper spectrum violet. Yet,
           it looks strangely alive. At the end of the "tendril"
           (of light) is an "eye" (a small multi-colored device)

     209   CREW REACTIONS -- ELEVATORS IN B.G. (O)                    209

           The bridge crew reacting hard, shocked and shaken --
           the THROBBING SOUND of the Alien thing intensifies
           as it begins to move across the bridge. Suddenly, in
           b.g., an elevator door snaps oen and two SECURITY
           MEN burst onto the bridge, phasers drawn. Chekov
           shouts warningly at the Men:

                                   CHEKOV
                     No weapons...!

           But Chekov is too late: First Security Man FIRES --
           the BLAST harmlessly absorbed by the Probe which emits
           a SCREECHING nerve-grating SOUND --- sends out a SMALL
           WHIPLASH ENERGY BOLT which instantly envelopes First
           Security Man in a PURPLE GLOW (of implosion). Second
           Security Man has almost lifted his phaser -- but now
           carefully, slowly is moving his hand away from his
           weapon.

     210   CLOSER - THE SECURITY MEN (O)                              210

           PURPLE GLOW FADES, the First Security Man has simply
           vanished.

       210A   FULL SHOT - BRIDGE                                        210A

           Chekov, like the others, horrified, flips a switch
           and the COMPUTER-VOICE ("Intruder Alert") goes OFF.
           At the same time Chekov speaks into his intercom:

                                   CHEKOV
                     Security... do not send further
                     teams!

           The Probe is sending out snake-like tendrils to the
           various consoles on the bridge.

           These tendrils lash out in a cobra-strike movement,
           the tendril-head seeming to enter into the console
           affected -- at which time all monitors and instrument
           lights there come ON as if the Probe is "reading"
           each console function. The crew carefully stays clear
           of the tendrils.

           Spock has risen, moving to Kirk's side as he slowly
           brings his tricorder up, very carefully extracting
           its tiny sensor and aiming it at the probe.

                                   CHEKOV
                             (shaken)
                     No intruder readings on other
                     decks, Captain...
                             (to Spock)
                     Can that be one of their crew?

                                   SPOCK
                             (quiet)

                             (to Kirk)
                     A plasma-energy combination...

           Meanwhile, the probe is now hovering near Chekov who
           sits frozen, fists clenched, jaw tight.

                                   DECKER
                     Don't interfere with it...!

                                   CHEKOV
                     Absolutely, I will not interfere!

       210B   ANGLE INCLUDING SPOCK'S CONSOLE (O)                       210B

           as the "probe" withdraws an energy-tendril from one
           bridge station and "inserts" it into another console.

                                   KIRK
                     No one interfere...! It doesn't
                     seem interested in us -- only
                     the ship...!

           Kirk's words are never completed as suddenly all the
           energy tendrils withdraw from all consoles and a
           larger, more powerful-looking tendril lashes out,
           snaking into the science console complex.

       210C   CLOSER ON SCIENCE CONSOLE                                 210C

           Where, also immediately, all the console and computer
           lights are suddenly flashing wildly, rapidly --

           -- There is an incredibly fast EXCHANGE OF HIGH-PITCHED
           BEES -- the computer obviously in unauthorized commu-
           nication with the probe!

                                   KIRK

                     Starfleet strength, Earth
                     defenses...

           As Decker moves to the main power control, Spock now
           steps in, his Vulcan strength easily brushing Kirk and
           Decker aside. Spock clasps his fists above his head,
           brings it down in a SHATTERING BLOW on the console. It
           splits open! As the bridge lights dim even more, and
           as the science console shorts itself out -- and off,
           Decker confronts Spock:

                                   DECKER
                     We could have cut it off at the
                     main computer...

                                   SPOCK
                     This served the purpose.

           Kirk has been giving Spock a puzzled look -- Spock now
           turns abruptly, and:

       210D   ANOTHER ANGLE (O)                                         210D

           as Spock, in stepping back, accidentally brushes the
           probe's energy tendril -- a FLASH OF LIGHT at the
           contact point sends Spock sinning under the rail and
           to the floor near Ilia. The probe's energy-tendril
           has withdrawn from the darkened science console, hov-
           ers high over the dazed Spock as if angrily seeking
           the reason for the break in its computer contact.
           Spock starts to rise.

                                   ILIA
                     Mr. Spock, don't move...!

           Decker steps toward her, AD LIBBING a grim "Ilia...!"
           But he has no chance as:

     211   OMITTED                                                    211

           The Probe hovers over her, its whole mass seemingly
           about to envelope her with a single tendril extended
           toward her, somehow freezing her into immobility -
           and then the entire Probe DISSOLVES IN A BLINDING 
           FLASH OF WHITE, obscuring Ilia. Almost instantly
           the WHITE FLASH FADES -- but Ilia has vanished -- her
           tricorder clattering to the deck.

                     We cannot break free, Captain.

           Spock peers in deep concentration at the Main Viewer,
           trying to sense some clue. Kirk glances at him another
           moment, then turns to the Main Viewer himself, watches
           in frustrated helplessness.

           bewildered, wants to ask what happened, but no time,
           and she quickly sits at the post, begins orienting
           herself. Meanwhile, Decker has begun an Executive
           Officer's bridge circuit, assisting with various con-
           soles. Kirk is glancing toward Spock who continues
           concentrating on the Viewer, striving to comprehend
           the myriad of thoughts he is sensing from he Aliens.
           McCoy also arrives on the bridge, takes in the chaotic
           scene, watches the Viewer grimly.

           At the forward end of the giant, an odd-shapped "iris"
           begins opening menacingly. And it is frighteningly
           obvious that the tractor beam is pulling the Enterprise
           to the opening.

           Enterprise is drawn closer, closer -- through the
           "iris" we now SEE (some of) V'ger's interior: a dark
           void relieved only by strange flickering glows of dis-
           tant ENERGY FIELD PATTERNS.

           The crew reacts with understandable awe, apprehension,
           curiosity, as:

                                   DECKER
                     Captain, suggest a maximum phaser
                     strike directly at the beam might
                     weaken it just enough for us to
                     break free --

           Spock replies for Kirk: quickly, as though to make his
           point convincingly:

                                   SPOCK
                     Break free to where, Commander...?

                     Any show of resistance would not
                     only be futile, Catain...

           as Kirk reacts somewhat curiously to Spock's remark,
           but it is Decker who articulates it:

                                   DECKER
                             (troubled; suspicious)
                     We don't know that, Mr. Spock.
                     Why are you opposed to trying?

                     Before Spock can reply:

                                   UHURA
                     They're pulling us inside...!

           All face the Viewer again, react, with McCoy who has
           been observing all these reactions now galvanized
           into action:

                                   McCOY

           Kirk staring at the viewer -- the "iris" now fully open
           so that the exterior of V'ger is no longer visible --
           and all we can SEE is the monstrous void dead ahead,
           which is looming faster and larger before our eyes.
           And now we are inside.

           Enterprise now being pulled past the opening -- into
           the ship proper. Now we can SEE that the dark void
           is actually a vast chamber, dimly and intermittently
           lit by POWERFIELDS appearing and vanishing along the
           vessel's inner walls, which are miles away in the 
           distance. And here and there in the chamber gigantic
           ENERGY DISPLAYS erupt briefly with a certain symmetry
           that suggests they must be part of V'ger's ower or
           control systems.

           to Spock:

                     Why bring us inside? Not to
                     destroy us; they could have 
                     done that outside.

     255   INT. ILIA'S CABIN - KIRK                                   255
 
           entering, Spock slightly behind him - and one Security
           Guard. Kirk glances around the room, now glances at
           the shower area and reacts as he sees the NAKED FORM.
           The others react similarly, even Spock cannot help re-
           pressing an expression of surprise. A moment's uncer-
           tainty as Kirk peers at them, then he steps to the
           stall door, hesitates another instant -- then slides
           the door open.

           (NOTE: Arrange lighting for bizarre, mysterious effect.)

           Kirk's eyes cannot believe what he is seeing:

       255A   "ILIA"                                                    255A

           standing in the sonic mist, naked but for a small
           multi-colored button embedded in her throat. As she
           looks at Kirk -- and the others -- the men peer back
           at her, speechless.

                                   "ILIA"
                     I have been programmed by V'ger
                     to observe and record normal
                     functioning of the carbon-based
                     units infesting USS ENTERPRISE.

           Kirk peers at her another nonplussed moment, then leans
           into the shower to touch a control, his eyes fixed on
           the lovely body behind the mist. He punches in a three
           digit code. Immediately a HUMMING SOUND emanates from
           the shower stall, Kirk closing the door, but 'Ilia"
           remaining inside.

     256   ACROSS KIRK AND THE OTHERS TO THE SHOWER STALL             256

           The HUMMING SOUND just now reaching a gentle crescendo
           -- through the translucent door you can see COLORS
           ENVELOPING "ILIA'S" FORM. And now the SOUND STOPS.
           "Ilia", attired in a leisure robe, steps from the stall,
           into the room. She stands facing Kirk, her face impas-
           sive, eyes unblinking. He looks her back a moment,
           then glances at Spock, who is gazing at "Ilia" in abso-
           lute fascination. Kirk addresses her:

                                   KIRK
                     Who is...'V'ger'...?

                                   "ILIA"
                     V'ger is that which programmed me.

                                   KIRK
                     Is V'ger the Captain of the alien
                     vessel?

       256A   ANGLE ON THE DOOR - McCOY                                 256A

           rushing in, concerned:

                                   McCOY
                     Jim, what's --

           At the sight of 'Ilia", McCoy's words die in his throat
           -- and his trained eyes have instantly told him some-
           thing is awry. He unslings his tricorder, aims the
           sensor unit at "Ilia". As he reads his instruments, his
           face reveals the results (incredulity, fascination).
           Meanwhile, from the start:

                                   "ILIA"
                     V'ger is that which seeks the
                     Creator.
                                   McCOY
                             (of "Ilia")
                     Jim, this is a mechanism...!

           Kirk stares at McCoy, then at "Ilia" and realizes that
           "Ilia" is indeed non-human. And quickly:
     
                                   KIRK
                     Where is Lt. Ilia?
     
                                   "ILIA"
                     That unit no longer functions.
                     I have been given its form to
                     more readily communicate with
                     the carbon-based units infesting
                     Enterprise.

                                   SECURITY GUARD
                     "Carbon-based units"...?

                                   McCOY
                             (drily)
                     Humans, Ensign Lang: us.

                              exam, increasingly
                              impressed)

                                   KIRK
                             (to "Ilia")
                     Why does V'ger travel to
                     the third planet of the
                     solar system directly
                     ahead?

                                   "ILIA"
                     V'ger travels to the third 
                     planet to find the Creator.

           Stunned, disbelieving reactions as all four attempt to
           digest this -- Spock gazing at "Ilia" with even more
           rapt fascination. Kirk, bewildered, addresses the
           others:

                                   KIRK
                     Find the Creator? What Creator?
                     Whose...!?
                             (to "Ilia")
                     What does V'ger want of the
                     'Creator'... ?

                                   "ILIA"
                     To join with him.

       256B   FAVORING SPOCK                                            256B

           suddenly alert, addressing "Ilia":

                         
                                   SPOCK
                     Join with the Creator... ? How?

                                   "ILIA"
                     V'ger and the Creator will become
                     One.

                                   SPOCK
                     Who is the Creator?

                                   McCOY
                             (worried)
                     Mr. Spock, be careful.

                                   "ILIA"
                     The Creator is that which created
                     V'ger.

                                   KIRK
                     Who is V'ger?

                                   "ILIA"
                     V'ger is that which seeks the
                     Creator.

           Another moment of total exasperation, frustration, during
           which "Ilia" seems to be waiting politely, patiently for
           any further questions. When none are forthcoming:

                                   "ILIA"
                            (continuing; pleasant,
                             bland)
                     I am ready to commence my
                     observations.

                                   SPOCK
                             (fast; to McCoy)
                     Doctor, a thorough examination
                     of this probe might provide some
                     insight into those who manufactured
                     it, and how to deal with them.

                                   McCOY
                     Let's get her to sickbay.

           And he grasps "Ilia's" arm to escort her. But is as
           though he has seized cast iron: immovable. McCoy is
           thrown off balance merely by 'Ilia's" remaining sta-
           tionary. She ignores McCoy, addresses Kirk:

                                   "ILIA"
                     I am programmed to observe and
                     record normal functioning
                     procedures of the carbon-based
                     units.

       256B   Kirk glances at McCoy, who is totally bemused, but then   256B
           Kirk quickly responds to "Ilia":
                         
                                   KIRK
                     The examination is a normal
                     function.

                                   "ILIA"
                             (a beat)
                     You may proceede.

                                   McCOY
                             (carefully)
                     Thank you.

     257   CLOSE SHOT OF EXAMINING ROOM VIEWER (O)                    257

           scanning a "body". PULL BACK TO SHOW McCoy, Chapel,
           Kirk, Spock and Chekov -- standing over "ILIA" who lies
           prone on the table, the physicians moving the scanner
           over her.

                                   McCOY
                             (from the start;
                              indicating)
                     ... micro-miniature hydraulics,
                     sensors, molecule-sized multi-
                     processor chips... and look at
                     this...

           In the b.g., Decker enters, grimly observes the proceed-
           ings.

                                   CHAPEL
                             (impressed)
                     An osmotic micro-pump... here
                     and here. Even the smallest
                     body functions are exactly
                     duplicated.
                             (traces with finger
                              on screen)
                     And every exocrine system is
                     here, too --

           Chapel breaks off abruptly, noticing "Ilia" is peering
           intently -- almost with a glimmer of recognition -- at
           Decker. Slightly disconcerted, Chapel continues:

                                   CHAPEL
                             (continuing)
                     -- even eye moisture.

                                   "ILIA"
                             (peering at Decker)
                     Deck -- er.

           as everyone reacts to "Ilia's" utterance of Decker's
           name. It seems to make the deepest impression on
           Spock, confirming something he has suspected.
                         
                                   SPOCK
                             (to "Ilia")
                     Interesting. Not 'Decker-unit'?

           "Ilia" continues peering at Decker with just a hint
           of a puzzled frown, a glimmer of distant recognition.
           It's the first time we've seen her expression look
           anything but cool and bland. This results in the
           quizzical rising of one of Spock's eyebrows.

     258   ANOTHER ANGLE                                              258

           McCoy's examination now turns "Ilia" away from the
           others. Spock quickly catches Kirk's and Decker's
           attention, indicates an adjoining door -- they fol-
           low him out of the room.

     259   INT. McCOY'S OFFICE                                        259

           as Kirk, Spock and Decker enter, the door snapping
           shut -- and Spock touching the electronic lock to
           secure them. He faces the others:

                                   SPOCK
                     Captain... this probe may be a key
                     a key to the Aliens.

                                   DECKER
                     It's a programmed mechanism,
                     Mr. Spock...

                                   SPOCK
                     We have just seen that its body
                     duplicates our navigator in
                     precise detail. Suppose that
                     beneath its programming, the
                     real Ilia's memory patterns are
                     duplicated with equal precision.

                                   KIRK
                     They had a pattern to follow...

                                   SPOCK
                             (nods)
                     ... they may have followed it
                     too precisely.

                            (comprehending)
                     Ilia's memory, her feelings of
                     loyalty, friendship, obedience...
                     might all be there.

           also comprehending, and not liking it one bit as Spock
           and Kirk are both turning their attention to him.

                                   SPOCK
                     Exactly.
                             (to Decker)
                     And you did have a 'relationship'
                     with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.

                                   DECKER
                     That probe in there -- in a
                     different form now -- is the
                     same thing that killed Ilia!

                                   KIRK
                     Commander, we're locked in an
                     alien vessel, six hours from
                     Earth orbit, our only contact
                     with our captors is the probe.
                     If we can control it, persuade
                     it, use it in some way...

           Interrupted by the SOUND of someone trying to open the
           locked door behind them. Then a METAL RIPPING SOUND
           as they whirl to see:

     260   MEDICAL OFFICE DOOR                                        260

           with the METAL BUCKLING, TEARING -- and a single
           hand slicing the steel door like paper. It is the
           "Ilia" probe, her face absolutely impassive, her
           whole manner incongruously benign. (Behind her, a
           startled McCoy, Chapel and Chekov.) "Ilia" speaks
           flatly, blandly.

                                   "ILIA"
                     I have recorded enough here.
                            (motions to Kirk)
                     You will now assist me further.

           Kirk exchanges a quick glance with Spock. Then:

           "Ilia" has seemed about to object -- but now her eyes
           hold on Decker. Then she nods.

           (AND "ILIA")

           as Decker looks at "Ilia" who stands at the torn door.
           You can read Decker's mind: I'm supposed to persuade
           that?! He turns back, finds Kirk's eyes on him.
           Decker nods.

                                   DECKER
                     Aye, sir.

           "Ilia" and a reluctant Decker EXIT.

           leave. Kirk notices.

                                   KIRK
                     Spock? Concerned about his
                     chances?

                     I am uneasy with that being
                     our only hope of more information.

           Spock EXITS.

           floating in the vast, eerie, alien chamber -- sporadic
           FLASHES OF ENERGY, erupting now and then. Various
           other EFFECTS. OVER this, Kirk's VOICE:

                     within the alien probe. This

           The area dimly lit -- unoccupied but for a lone AIRLOCK
           TECHNICIAN checking and adjusting instruments. The
           CAMERA MOVES PAST him to FIND:

           His face fixed with grim determination, walking quietly
           with obvious intent not to attract the Tech's attention.
           Now he steals up behind the TECH -- and in an instant
           has applied a Vulcan nerve pinch. The Tech slumps over
           his console.

           "Ilia" is giving the pictures a very interested look
           as we HEAR in Kirk's cabin:

           Decker and "Ilia", the Rec Deck unoccupied but for a
           pair of wary SECURITY GUARDS at a very discreet dis-
           tance. They are near the pictures of the five Enter-
           prises, which should be FEATURED in this SHOT, as
           Decker waves his hand about the huge room.

                                   DECKER
                     The carbon units use this area

                     What type of recreation does the
                     crew aboard your vessel enjoy...?

     268   CLOSER TWO SHOT (PICTURES O.S.)                            268

           As "Ilia" moves on into the room, Decker follows:
                         
                                   "ILIA"
                     The words 'recreation' and 'enjoy'
                     have no meaning to my programming.

           Decker peers at the lovely android with frustration --
           and no little pain, for she is after all the exact
           replica of Ilia. She pays not the slightest attention
           to Decker's reaction, and begins walking about the Rec
           Deck taking in (and, clearly, transmitting all images
           to V'ger) the sights. They are near a game area (elec-
           tronic games), and now Decker points to one game,
           switches it on -- presses button to activate its
           LIGHTS and SOUNDS. "Ilia" watches interestedly as
           Decker operates the game.

                                   DECKER
                     Ilia 'enjoyed' this game... she
                     nearly always won --

           And he demonstrates again, as "Ilia" steps to the
           device, deftly hits some buttons -- and for just an
           instant she turns to Decker with a momentary glimmer
           of recognition.

     269   INT. KIRK'S CABIN - GROUP WATCHING THE MONITOR             269

           McCoy watching with special interest:

                                   McCOY
                             (approving)
                     Good! He's using audial-visual
                     association.

           But the words are not out of McCoy's mouth when "Ilia"
           says:

                                   "ILIA"
                     This device serves no purpose.

           She steps away from the game; Decker's disappointment
           is evident. So is everyone elses.

                                   KIRK
                     Damn...!

                             (nods grimly)
                     She needs something else:
                     something much more personal to
                     stimulate memory patterns. Something
                     with a more emotional tie.

           Kirk reacts to this, reflective.

     270   INT. REC DECK  FULL ON DECKER AND "ILIA"                   270

           Decker waving back toward the general area of the
           Enterprise pictures.

                                   DECKER
                     The crews of the previous
                     Enterprises were also carbon units.
                     In what way is the life form in
                     your vessel different?

                                   "ILIA"
                     Carbon units are not true life
                     forms... Do those images repre-
                     sent how Enterprise has evolved
                     into its present form?

                                   DECKER
                             (hoping he's struck
                              a responsive chord)
                     Yes.

                                   "ILIA"
                     Carbon units have clearly retarded
                     Enterprise's proper evolvement.

                                   DECKER
                             (controlling surprise)
                     What is Enterprise's proper
                     evolvement?

                                   "ILIA"
                     Enterprise should not require
                     the presence of carbon units.

           And with this she moves off, observing other Rec Deck
           objects. Decker moves with her; then:

                                   DECKER
                             (carefully)
                     Enterprise would be unable to
                     function without carbon units.

                                   "ILIA"
                     More data concerning this functioning
                     is necessary before carbon units can
                     be patterned for data storage.

     271   ACROSS "ILIA" TO DECKER                                    271

           as he reacts to this ominous note; he stops abruptly.

                                   DECKER
                     What does that mean?

                                   "ILIA"
                             (stopping; almost
                              pleasantly)
                     When my examination is complete, 
                     the carbon units will be reduced 
                     to data patterns.

           This has been delivered with chilling blandness, and
           she stands facing Decker, almost as though waiting for
           him to thank her. He thinks fast now.

                                   DECKER
                     Within you are memory patterns of
                     a carbon unit. If I can help you
                     revive these patterns; you could
                     understand our functions better.

                                   "ILIA"
                     That is logical. You may procede.

           realizing the difficult task ahead; the pain he will
           suffer.

           The ship stationary in the chamber as now we SEE an
           exterior hatch sliding fully open. Up through the
           hatch a circular airlock door opens -- and a tiny
           figure in a thruster spacesuit emerges, steps into
           space, slowly floats down through the hatch and under
           the Enterprise saucer section. In this and subsequent
           VIEWS we will SEE that on the rear pack of his thruster
           spacesuit is a FLASHING STROBE LIGHT which regularly
           EMITS the identifying SIGNAL of this particular suit.
           (By which Kirk will be able to see Spock's position
           even from several miles away.)

           MOVING TOWARD the CAMERA until the features behind
           the face mask are clearly identifiable: Spock, his
           face set in the same grim, determined expression, as
           he touches his spacesuit transmitter control.

           His features now set into an almost trance-like expres-
           sion as he concentrates on the thought emanations.
           Then we SEE his head turn, he peers off -- then he
           moves his thruster controls. We SEE the small blue
           jets of his thrusters -- his spacesuit figure begins
           to move off in the direction he was concentrating
           upon.

     277   ANOTHER ANGLE - SPOCK                                      277

           His thrusters moving him across V'ger's vast chamber
           then dropping down into a deep "trough"-like area
           which stretches into the distance ahead of him. A
           cloud of CRYSTAL FORMS (Kirk's entrapment) become
           visible to one side but Spock passes them at some dis-
           tance and does not attract them.

           We can SEE more clearly now the point on the inner wall
           of the trough toward which Spock is heading. It is an
           unusual combination of GLOWING FORCEFIELDS which seem
           to mark this point of the vessel as of some importance.
           (Here, also, we will become aware of "sensor-bee"
           swarms, intermittently darting toward this same wall
           from all points of the chamber.)

                     I want him to lead me to whatever's
                     out there...!

                                   McCOY
                     And if that 'whatever' has taken
                     over his mind....?
                                   KIRK
                     Then he'll have still led me to
                     it, won't he?

           And Kirk steps into the airlock door, hits a control --
           it begins sliding closed behind him.

     279   INT. V'GER - ANGLE UP TOWARD ENTERPRISE                    279

           UP THROUGH the circular airlock door as it slides open
           -- and Kirk's tiny spacesuited figure floats down
           clear of the saucer.

     280   CLOSER ON KIRK                                             280

           SEEING his face through the spacesuit faceplate as he
           scans the darkness.

                     axis.

           During which, Kirk spots something.

           Spock's STROBE blinker at a mile or so distance,
           nearing V'ger's inner walls.

     282   ANGLE ON KIRK                                              282

                                   KIRK
                     I have him in sight.

           During which, Kirk touches his thruster controls and
           blue thruster jet propels him off in the direction
           indicated. His thrusters come on for a longer period
           of time as he accelerates to the higher speed necessary
           to overtake Spock...

     283   INT. ILIA'S QUARTERS                                       283

           The DOOR SNAPPING open, and "Ilia", McCoy and Decker
           entering. Then CAMERA REVEALS Chapel already inside,
           looking through some female adornments she's found
           there.

                                   CHAPEL
                     I remember Lt. Ilia once mentioning
                     that she wore this...

                                   DECKER
                             (reacting; tight)
                     ... when we met.

           Clearly this is very painful to Decker. Meanwhile,
           Chapel hands the Deltan headband to "Ilia".
                     
                                   CHAPEL
                             (gently)
                     Put it on.

           "Ilia" hasn't the slightest idea what to do with the
           headband, holds it, runs her fingers over the jewels
           and feathers embedded into it. Chapel takes it from
           her, places it on 'Ilia's" head, now switches on the
           light illuminating the dressing table mirror -- stands
           behind her with Decker, both watching apprehensively.

     284   ANGLE ON "ILIA"                                            284

           studying her image in the mirror, her face totally
           blank a moment, but then breaking into a bemused
           frown -- as though trying to remember. And:

                                   CHAPEL
                             (helpfully)
                     Ilia...

                                   DECKER
                             (quiet; urging)
                     On Delta... remember...?

           And it seems that "Ilia" does remember. She peers at
           her image, then sets the headband into its exact
           proper position. Then she turns and looks at them
           with recognition.

                                   "ILIA"
                             (haltingly)
                     Dr. Chapel...

       285   ACROSS CHAPEL TO DECKER                                    285

           as Chapel smiles, pleased, and looks at Decker who
           stares at "Ilia" nonplussed. This is Ilia coming
           alive!

                                   "ILIA"
                             (to Decker)
                     "Will..."

           And she touches his hand, runs her own hand over it,
           and smiles.

           Decker is completely overwhelmed, struggles for words
           and looks to McCoy for some kind of help. McCoy
           realizes Decker is losing himself in fantasy.

                                   McCOY
                             (gently reminding)
                     Commander... this is a mechanism...

           Decker is startled, and for another slit-second he's
           lost -- but then he realizes the reality, and what he
           should do:
                                   DECKER
                             (gently; but urgingly)
                     Ilia, help us make direct contact
                     with V'ger...

                                   "ILIA
                     I... cannot.

           Decker looks at "Ilia's" hand still resting on his.
           Then:

                                   DECKER
                     Then tell us who V'ger is; where
                     he's from... W need your help.

           For another moment "Ilia" continues smiling at Decker,
           holding his hand. Then, abruptly, the smile vanishes
           -- the hand is released. Clearly, she's again the
           probe, as:

                                   "ILIA"
                     Why have two carbon units entered
                     V'ger...?

           Decker glances at McCoy, who shakes his head almost
           imperceptibly: he doesn't know. But Decker has an
           obvious reply:

                                   DECKER
                     They want to make contact with
                     V'ger...
                             (trying to revive
                              "Ilia's" memory again;
                              touches her hand)
                     Ilia...

           "Ilia" peers at him blankly, allows him to continue 
           touching her hand, but obviously it means nothing to
           her.

                                   DECKER
                             (continuing;
                              distressed,
                              to "Ilia")
                     Does V'ger object to the presence
                     of the two carbon units?

                                   "ILIA"
                     The carbon units are of no
                     consequence; V'ger will determine
                     their purpose.

                                   McCOY
                     Their purpose is to survive.

                                   "ILIA"
                     That is also V'ger's purpose.

           Decker's face reflects his bemusement:

                                   DECKER
                     You said V'ger's purpose was to
                     find and join with the Creator.

                                   "ILIA"
                     That is how V'ger will survive.

           as now, the bemusement changes to just the slightest
           enlightenment.

                                   "ILIA"
                     I wish to continue my observations.

     287   INT. V'GER - KIRK MANEUVERING WITHIN THE CHAMBER           287
         
           Kirk but a small object, thruster jets occasionally
           spurting as he guides himself deeper into the trench
           as he continues forward progress in the direction he
           saw Spock taking.

           So we can SEE his face (through the plate), as he looks
           ahead into the distance toward Spock.

           Spock's STROBE signal closer and Spock's tiny space-
           suited figure now becoming dimly visible as he moves
           steadily toward the GLOWING FORCEFIELDS of the inner
           wall.

           His attention fixed on Spock, he never notices until
           an instant too late an O.S. object; quickly he hits a
           thruster control, and we SEE the MANEUVERING JET turn
           him to the side as:

     291   WIDER ANGLE - KIRK AND THE BLOB FORMATION (O)              291

           A swarm of strange-looking translucent crystal-like
           FORMS on a collision course with Kirk. (NOTE: They
           were traveling randomly, and are not deliberate ob-
           structions. However, Kirk's nearness now has attracted
           them and the swarm of them heads in his direction.
           Kirk tries to avoid them; he hits a second MANEUVERING
           JET -- but he overcompensates, and spins straight into
           the intercepting swarm of them.

     292   MED. SHOT - KIRK (O)                                       292

           as the nearest crystal forms WHIP INTO SHOT, adhering
           to Kirk's spacesuit. He hits full MANEUVERING JETS
           now, seems to make some escape, but still more forms
           WHIP IN, adhere.

           MAGNIFIED CLOSER, pulling Kirk into MEDIUM LONG SHOT.
           We can SEE the details of the swarm of forms adhering.
           But we can SEE that Kirk's spacesuit is now about half
           covered with them!

           as Kirk's VOICE STOPS -- and all that is heard now
           is the HEAVY STATIC crackling ominously. Spock's
           expression flickers, then he hits reverse thruster
           JETS, stops -- he turns to glance at the inner wall,
           then his thrusters turn him so he can look back the
           way he came from. But he cannot resist Kirk's call;
           he suddenly hits his thruster controls, then JETS
           FLARE, and:

           CAMERA. As he approaches Kirk, Spock brings out his
           phaser. Now he hits the controls for the REVERSE JETS --
           he slows RAPIDLY as he approaches Kirk's now complete-

                     dilemma -- or your personal one?

           Spock does not immediately reply, peers at Kirk through
           the faceplate a long beat, then abruptly looks away,
           points off into the distance:

     302   ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING INNER WALL (O)                   302

           We can SEE what appear to be SPARKLING GLOBULES OF
           LIGHT darting toward the inner wall in the distance,
           then disappearing there. (We'll SEE other swarms
           occasionally too, coming from different directions --
           they will later be identified as "sensor swarms" on
           closer examination.)

                                   SPOCK
                             (pointing)
                     Captain, I believe there we will
                     find an indication of whoever --
                     or whatever -- is aboard this
                     vessel...

           Kirk weighs alternatives, then pushes his thruster
           controls and begins moving in the direction Spock
           indicated.

           Their thruster jets flash, propel them toward the 
           point on the inner wall.

     303   INT. V'GER - AT INNER WALL                                 303

           The most prominent area of the vast inner wall -- the
           patterns on the wall here seem to GLOW with life.
           The spacesuited figures of Kirk and Spock ENTER SCENE,
           gliding slowly toward what seems to be the central
           part of theses patterns.

     304   CLOSER ON KIRK AND SPOCK                                   304

           as they approach and then we SEE the brief REVERSE
           THRUSTERS and then forward momentum stops; motionless.
           Then Spock sees something, indicates.

     305   LONG ANGLE TO INCLUDE SENSOR SWARM (O)                     305

           Now, we SEE that they are tiny, multi-colored points
           of FLASHING LIGHT -- almost like swarms of bees.
           They approach the inner wall at this central point
           and seem to "disappear" through the orifice.

     306   KIRK AND SPOCK - ANOTHER "SWARM" APPROACHING (O)           306

           This "sensor swarm" has been coming from a direction
           that will take them close past Kirk and Spock. Then,
           as it passes, Spock reaches out quickly, grabs.
           He turns to Kirk, his hand closed on something.

     307   CLOSE ON KIRK AND SPOCK (AGAINST "TUBE" WALL)              307

           Spock opens his hand, retaining a hold on something
           with his fingers. He brings it up to Kirk's face mask
           -- it's a tiny SENSOR, its multi-colors flashing as it
           tries to escape from Spock's fingers. And in this CLOSE
           VIEW, we SEE that this is a SENSOR very much like the
           one we've seen earlier embedded in the Ilia-probe's
           throat hollow. Then Spock releases it and it darts
           to join the sensor swarm near the opening of the inner
           wall.

     308   KIRK AND SPOCK'S POV (O)                                   308

           From this closer distance, we SEE that an opening ap-
           pears in the wall, admits the sensor swarm, then closes
           immediately.

     309   BACK TO SHOT                                               309

           Kirk and Spock exchange a look. Their thruster JETS
           ignite briefly, moving them in that direction.

     310   INT. V'GER - KIRK AND SPOCK (O)                            310

           closely approaching the inner wall now, timing their
           movements to coincide with the arrival of another
           "swarm" -- the wall begins OPENING. The "swarm"
           through, the wall begins CLOSING -- but Spock and 
           Kirk slip in before it closes.

     311   INT. "MEMORY CAVE" - SPOCK AND KIRK                        311

           The wall closing behind them, they are safely inside.
           But as they stop their forward momentum, their eyes
           widen with awe and surprise at what they are seeing:

       311A   WHAT THEY SEE (M)                                         311A

           The long "cave" chamber with its row of huge MEDIATOR
           BALLS extending into the distance. To one side, the
           gleaming CRYSTAL MEMORY WALL.

       311B   KIRK AND SPOCK                                            311B

           as Spock makes a quick analysis and estimate of what
           they are seeing. Then, he takes out his tricorder
           again, propels himself toward the memory crystals.
           Kirk follows.

       311C   AT MEMORY CRYSTAL                                         311C

           as Spock adjusts his tricorder through several readings.

                                   SPOCK
                     It would appear that the atomic
                     arrays of these crystals store
                     information. A remarkably
                     efficient system.

                                   KIRK
                             (indicates)
                     And these 'sensor-swarms' collect
                     that data, carry it here.

                                   SPOCK
                             (nods; indicates)
                     New crystals: they must contain
                     the most recent data obtained --

           And Spock touches one of these new crystals (it will be
           shinier, more pulsating than the others): ANOTHER 

RAPID
           PROFUSION OF FAINT IMAGES, but this time including a
           pattern-like image of Klingons, Klingon vessels (the
           ones destroyed by the Cloud), and obvious Starfleet
           personnel -- and the Epsilon 9 station. Also, a 

pattern
           of the Security Guard killed by the probe. And Ilia.
     
                                   KIRK
                     Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station
                     ... and Ilia!! They seem to be 
                     more than just images...

                                   SPOCK 
                             (agreeing)
                     Exact patterns. The energy bolt
                     that hit them wasn't simply a
                     weapon -- it dematerialized them,
                     stored them. But why?

           And he turns and begins moving on, studying the wall,
           consulting his tricorder.

     312   ACROSS THEM TO ANOTHER SECTION OF THE WALL                 312

           Spock inspecting this area at which the "newer" crystals
           are PULSATING and GLOWING, and which appears to be a
           termination of the Crystal area, continuing on and dis-
           appearing through the wall.

                                   KIRK
                     If this is their ship's data
                     banks, where is the crew? Or
                     is their entire ship automated?

                                   SPOCK
                     Captain, I do not believe there
                     is a crew -- or that this is a
                     vessel as such.

           A beat, as Kirk reacts incredulously.

                                   SPOCK
                             (continuing)
                     I am almost certain now that all
                     of this is V'ger -- I believe
                     that we are inside a life form,
                     a living machine.

           Spock turns his spacesuit, turns his tricorder out to-
           ward the Mediator Balls, takes a reading in that di-
           rection. Then a glance to Kirk.

                                   SPOCK
                     I must attempt mindmeld with it,
                     Captain.

           Spock touches his spacesuit controls; the THRUSTER
           JETS move him out toward the Mediator Balls.

                                   KIRK
                             (warningly)
                     Spock...

     313   ANGLE AT MEDIATOR BALL                                     313

           Spock reaching the Ball, halts his momentum and removes
           one gauntlet, baring his hand. Stretching the bare
           hand toward a part of it which looks strangely "alive."
           The very power generated from this area is clearly
           affecting Spock's hand. Meanwhile, Kirk has used his
           THRUSTERS to join him.

                                   KIRK
                     Spock, if you're right, its mind
                     may be enormous...

           But Spock pays him no attention, his entire being now
           focused on the PULSATING GLOW of the "alive" area --
           the CAMERA MOVING IN CLOSER TO Spock, as he forces his
           hand toward that surface, closer, closer.

     314   KIRK                                                       314

           watching, almost mesmerized. Torn between wanting to
           pull Spock away from the wall -- and knowing that
           Spock must go through with it. For everyone's sake.

     315   CLOSER ON SPOCK                                            315

           preparing for the ordeal, moving his hand to the "liv-
           ing area," the invisible force even stronger -- but
           Spock's strength unwavering, and now he touches the 
           surface -- and it FLARES WITH STRANGE ENERGY at the
           touch. And at the same moment Spock' body convulses
           as if tens of thousands of volts of electricity are
           charging through him.

     316   CLOSE ON SPOCK'S FACE                                      316

           as he begins to shudder with the shock, the CAMERA
           CONTINUES INTO EXTREME CLOSE-UP as we SEE Spock's mouth
           open -- he SCREAMS. CAMERA INTO EXTREME CLOSE SHOT OF
           SPOCK'S EYES.

     317   CAMERA ZOOM - THROUGH SPOCK'S EYES                         317

           MUSIC IN AND UP as we travel through ABSTRACT IMAGES
           (per Con Pederson discussion). Symbolizing V'ger's
           incredible and complex store of mechanistic knowledge,
           these IMAGES suggest patterns of atoms, molecules,
           galaxies, dimensions of the universe beyond human
           knowledge or comprehension. It takes only fifteen or
           twenty seconds, but seems to span aeons, taking us
           through micro-infinity and macro-infinity.

           DISSOLVE TO :

     318   INT. DISPENSARY - SPOCK'S EYES                             318

           CAMERA BRIDGING BACK OUT THROUGH SPOCK'S EYES AND INTO
           ANGLE ON SPOCK'S FACE as he lies in a sickbay bed. His
           eyes are open; he is staring straight ahead as if in a
           catatonic state, completly unaware of his surroundings.
           Then Doctor Chapel leans INTO SCENE, moving a medical
           scanner over the brain area.

                                   CHAPEL
                     Now scanning pons area at spinal
                     nerve fiber connection...

     319   ANGLE ON McCOY AND KIRK                                    319

           McCoy at a console, watching readings he is getting
           from Chapel's scanner. Kirk watches McCoy anxiously.

                                   McCOY
                     Indications of some neurological
                     trauma--the power pouring through
                     that mind-meld must have been
                     staggering...

           Before Kirk can reply, they HEAR a LAUGH! An abrupt,
           harsh, bitter laugh.

     320   ACROSS THEM TO SICKBAY                                     320

           as all whirl to the patient area where it is obviously
           Spock who has just laughed -- but there is no indication
           of laughter from him now. A startled Chapel has stepped
           back away from the bed. Spock seems to be attempting
           to focus, orient himself as Kirk and McCoy hurry to the
           bedside.

                                   SPOCK
                             (quiet)
                     Jim...

           And Spock reaches out a hand weakly., takes a surprised
           Kirk's hand in his. McCoy exchanges a surprised glance 
           with Kirk, as Spock -- clutching Kirk's hand in friend-
           ship and need -- struggles to summon strength to speak.

                                   SPOCK
                             (continuing)
                     This simple feeling...
                             (looks at Kirk)
                     ... is so far beyond V'ger's
                     comprehension.

     321   ANOTHER ANGLE                                              321

           with Kirk and McCoy exchanging another surprised
           glance (at Spock's emotion), with McCoy gesturing Kirk
           not to question it.

                                   KIRK
                             (gently)
                     Were you right? Spock? V'ger
                     is a living machine...?
     
                                   SPOCK
                             (nodding)
                     A life form of its own; a
                     conscious, living entity.

                                   CHAPEL
                             (reacting)
                     A living machine...?!

                                   McCOY
                             (to Chapel)
                     We're living machines, too: protein
                     mechanisms.

           Kirk nods at McCoy.

                                   KIRK
                     And it considers the Enterprise a
                     living machine: that's why the
                     probe refers to our ship as an
                     entity.

                                   CHAPEL
                     If it thinks our ship is alive
                     what does it think we are?

                                   McCOY
                             (dryly)
                     An 'infestation' -- bacteria...
                     microbes.

     322   ANOTHER ANGLE                                              322

           as Spock turns to Kirk.

                                   SPOCK
                     I saw V'ger's planet: a planet
                     populated by living machines.
                     Unbelievable technology.
                             (pained)
                     V'ger has knowledge that spans this
                     universe.
                     And... in all this order... all
                     this magnificence, V'ger feels
                     no awe...no delight... no beauty...
                             (a beat; exhausted)
                     I should have known...

           Kirk waits for Spock to continue, but Spock seems too
           weak.

                                   KIRK
                     Know what, Spock? What?

           But Spock falls back, exhausted -- and McCoy gently
           tugs at Kirk, AD-LIBBING, "Let him rest, Jim..."
           Kirk shrugs McCoy away, addresses Spock:

                                   KIRK
                             (continuing)
                     What should you have known?

                                   SPOCK
                             (weak)
                     No meaning... No hope...
                             (summoning strength)
                     And, Jim, no answers...!
                     Jim, it's looking for answers
                     itself!

                                   KIRK
                     What answers?

                                   SPOCK
                     'Is this all I am? Is there not
                     more?'

           Just then an INTERCOM SIGNAL:

                                   UHURA'S VOICE
                     A faint signal from Starfleet,
                     sir! Intruder Cloud has been
                     located on their outer monitors
                     for past twenty-seven minutes...
                     dissipating rapidly as it approaches.

           Immediately, Sulu's voice:

                                   SULU'S VOICE
                     Starfleet reports forward velocity
                     has slowed to sub-warp speed! We
                     are three minutes from Earth's
                     orbit!-

                                   KIRK
                             (into intercom)
                     I'll be right there...
                             (to Chapel; crisp)
                     I need Spock on the bridge.

     323   ANOTHER ANGLE                                              323

           as Chapel urns to a MED TECH, AD LIBS an order,
           "Dalaphaline, twenty cc's..." As the Tech quickly sets
           the hypo-injector, and hands it to Chapel - and she
           injects Spock, the hypo emitting a fast, QUIET HISS --
           Kirk gazes at Spock just an instant as Spock breathes
           deeply, the drug clearly strengthening him. Chapel
           and the Tech help Spock from the bed, as Kirk addresses
           McCoy:

                                   KIRK
                     A machine planet...? Sending a
                     machine to Earth looking for its
                     Creator...?

                                   McCOY
                     God.

           Kirk looks at him, then at Spock -- on his feet now --
           then at McCoy again:

                                   KIRK
                     'To find the Creator,' the probe
                     said. Find God...?

                                   McCOY
                     Isn't that what we're all trying
                     to do...?
                             (dryly)
                     All us machines...?

           Kirk stands facing him another moment, then whirls
           and steps to the monitor, flips some buttons, and
           peaks into his communicator.

                                   KIRK
                     Mr. Chekov, Commander Decker's
                     present location?

                                   CHEKOV'S VOICE
                     He... they... are in Engineering,
                     sir.

                                   KIRK
                             (into intercom)
                     I want to make a ship's announcement.
                     But it's to be heard only in
                     Engineering.

                                   UHURA'S VOICE
                     Ready, Captain.

                                   KIRK
                             (voice amplified)
                     This is the Captain speaking. It
                     appears that the alien ship...
                     V'ger... is NOT a manned vessel...

     324   ENGINEERING                                                324

           SHOWING Scott (at his console) listening to Kirk's
           words -- and facing Decker and "Ilia" who are just
           about to leave Engineering. (In b.g. the Engine core
           GLOWS the appropriate color, and there is a SOFT
           HUM of IDLE POWER.) Kirk's VOICE continues:

                                   KIRK'S VOICE
                             (amplified)
                     It is a living entity...! A machine
                     life form. We are attempting to
                     ascertain its intentions. All
                     personnel will maintain yellow alert
                     status!

     325   CLOSER ON DECKER AND "ILIA"                                325
 
           The probe bland as usual, but Kirk's words seem to
           have strangely elated Decker; he says to her:

                                   DECKER
                     A machine...! Then it had to be
                     programmed. By whom...?

                                   "ILIA"
                     By the Creator.

                                   DECKER
                             (probing)
                     To join, and become One with the
                     Creator?

                                   "ILIA"
                     To learn all that is learnable;
                     to deliver all collected data to
                     the Creator on the third planet.
                     That is the programming.

     326   INCLUDE SCOTT                                              326

           just now confronting them, regarding "Ilia" with open
           disapproval.

                                   SCOTT
                     Well, sir, now what about all that?
                     A living entity, the Captain says...
                     entity... A living thing...!

           Decker really hasn't heard Scott; he's gazing at "Ilia,"
           attempting to digest what she's just said. But quickly:

                                   DECKER
                     Thank you, Scotty...

           He moves to leave.

                                   SCOTT
                             (dourly)
                     Your welcome, sir.

           Now Decker and "Ilia" move toward the exit, Scott gaz-
           ing after them glaringly, watching "Ilia's" every
           move. Suddenly, almost into the corridor, "Ilia" turns
           and looks back at the engine room. She addresses
           Decker, but load enough for Scott to overhear:

                                   "ILIA"
                     There is no logical reason for
                     carbon units to control Enterprise's
                     power systems.

                                   SCOTT
                             (to "Ilia")
                     Lassie, if I were functioning
                     'logically,' right now I'd be
                     showing you the inside of our
                     scrap metal compactor!

     327   INT. BRIDGE                                                327

           Kirk with McCoy and Spock, who although somewhat shaky,
           is clearly more alert. They are just assuming their
           stations.

                                   UHURA
                     We're now locked into Starfleet's
                     transceivers; Admiral Nogura has
                     received your reports, sir.

     328   ANGLE INCLUDING VIEWER (O)                                 328

           Kirk pausing halfway to his chair to study the viewer
           on which is appearing an IMAGE of V'ger looming omi-
           nously in orbit over Earth.

                                   UHURA
                     The visual is a lunar monitor
                     relay, sir.

           As they begin to study it, the IMAGE suddenly distorts and 
           is replaced by signal interference -- SIGNAL STATIC LINES 
           RUNNING ACROSS THE VIEWER SCREEN. 
           (Somewhat resembling the kind of high voltage interference
           some-times seen on the television screen.)

                                   UHURA
                             (continuing)
                     Heavy interference, sir -- it's
                     coming from here, inside the
                     intruder itself...

           Uhura hits buttons and immediately from the speakers we 
           HEAR A SERIES OF CARRIER WAVE BEEPS. Spock looks up from 
           his console, listens to it.

                                   SPOCK
                     Puzzling! The interference
                     appears to be a rather simple
                     carrier wave code signal...

                                   UHURA
                     On an old style radio frequency,
                     sir...

     329   PAST KIRK TO THE ELEVATOR                                  329

           as the doors snap open and Decker and "Ilia" appear.
           All eyes go to them as:

                                   "ILIA"
                             (to Decker;
                              interrupting)
                     As I stated, V'ger calls to the
                     Creator.

                                   DECKER
                            (nods; turns to Kirk)
                     V'ger is announcing that it has
                     arrived, sir -- that it's ready
                     to deliver the information it
                     was programmed to collect...

                                   "ILIA"
                     'To learn all that is learnable.'

                                   DECKER
                             (to Kirk)
                     It expects a return signal now,
                     ordering it to transmit that 
                     information to the Creator.

                                   UHURA
                             (whirling)
                     Sir! V'ger's signals have
                     stopped...

                                   "ILIA"
                             (as if frightened)
                     Decker... The Creator has not 
                     responded.

           Kirk hears this, turning inquiringly toward her, but
           Uhura interrupts:

                                   UHURA
                     Picking up Starfleet again; a
                     lunar monitor relay...

     330   ANGLE INCLUDING VIEWER (O)                                 330

           as, indeed, the interference is fading and a new Main 
           Viewer IMAGE is appearing -- it shows V'GER IN EARTH 
           ORBIT with a strange looking OBJECT moving away from 
           V'ger. It is an ominous looking, HUGE SWIRLING GREEN
           MASS -- it resembles the same green plasma-energy bolts
           that destroyed the Klingons and Epsilon 9 -- and very 
           nearly the Enterprise. It is not a bolt now -- the mass 
           is much larger and appears much more deadly. A second 
           object has now formed and moves off, a third one begins 
           to appear. (Meanwhile, the first and second PLASMA-
           ENERGY OBJECTS are moving off into the distance in 
           different direction.)

                                   McCOY
                     My God! They're the same kind
                     of things that destroyed the
                     Klingons, Epsilon Nine...

                                   SPOCK
                             (interrupting; from
                              science console)
                     These read as identical composition...
                             (turns to Kirk)
                     ... however, Captain, they measure
                     several hundred times more
                     powerful!

                                   KIRK
                     High mag, Mr. Sulu!

           Sulu adjusts the viewer through several IMAGE MAGNI-
           FICATIONS until we SEE the huge OMINOUS GREEN DEVICES
           more clearly.

                                   SULU
                     The third one is moving off too --
                     a fourth one is forming...

                                   UHURA
                             (overlapping)
                     Urgent signal from Starfleet,
                     Captain!
                             (turns, shaken)
                     All Earth defense systems have
                     gone dead.

           Kirk reacts hard at this. Uhura gets another message.

                                   UHURA
                              (continuing)
                     Sir, Starfleet computes their
                     trajectories as moving toward
                     equidistant positions over Earth.

     331   ANOTHER ANGLE - KIRK AND SPOCK                             331

           exchanging significant glances.

                                   SPOCK
                     From four equidistant positions,
                     Captain, a detonation would blanket
                     the entire surface of the planet.

                                   DIFALCO
                     I plot them as reaching equidistant
                     positions in... twenty-nine
                     minutes, sir... mark!

     332   ACROSS KIRK TO DECKER AND "ILIA"                           332

           as Kirk vaults from his chair, strides to a handrail to
           confront the "Ilia"-probe.

                                   KIRK
                     Why...?!

                                   "ILIA"
                     The carbon-units infection will
                     now be removed from the Creator's
                     planet.

                                   KIRK
                     Why?!

                                   "ILIA"
                     The Creator has not answered.

                                   KIRK
                     The carbon-units are not
                     responsible for that.

                                   "ILIA"
                     You infest and control Enterprise.
                     V'ger believes carbon-units interfere
                     with the Creator in the same manner.

                                   SPOCK
                             (to Kirk)
                     Then V'ger believes the Creator to
                     be a machine too.

                                   DECKER
                            (nods)
                     It seems we all imagine God in our
                     own image.

           Three of the four OMINOUS SWIRLING GREEN OBJECTS have
           all moved away from V'ger now, in different directions,
           growing smaller in the distance. The fourth object is
           holding position nearby, seeming to grow in size and
           intensity.

     334   ANGLE EMPHASIZING KIRK                                     334

           as he throws a look toward Spock who is now in deep
           meditation. Kirk turns and takes "Ilia's" shoulders
           and carefully turns her to face him.

                                   McCOY
                     '... similar life forms...?'
                     Jim, V'ger's saying the Creator
                     is a machine...!

                                   DECKER
                             (grimly amused)
                     Of course: we all create God
                     in our own image.

           Kirk peers at Decker a moment, ingesting this thought. 
           Then he addresses "Ilia" again, this time with emotion: 
           after all, he is pleading for the survival of the 
           entire planet:

                                   KIRK
                     V'ger! If we are lesser beings,
                     we are still, like you, living.
                     And because we are alive, we --
                     like you -- wish to survive.
                     You must not destroy --
     
           Kirk pauses abruptly: "Ilia" is regarding him blandly,
           stonily -- not the slightest reaction or response;
           clearly Kirk's plea is being ignored.
           Kirk draws in his breath to continue, realizes the
           futility, turns helplessly to Spock.

     335   ACROSS KIRK TO SPOCK                                       335

           who has been listening intently, with near fascination
           -- an idea forming in his mind. Quickly, he steps
           down to Kirk:

                                   SPOCK
                             (quiet, terse)
                     Captain...
                             (reaches Kirk)
                     Treat V'ger as you would... a
                     child.

     336    FAVORING KIRK                                             336
     
            startled at this, not sure he's heard correctly.

                                   KIRK
                     Child...!?

                                   SPOCK
                     Yes, Captain, a child: evolving
                     into adulthood -- learning, searching
                     -- instinctively needing.

                                   DECKER
                             (intrigued)
                     Needing what...?

                                   McCOY
                     Spock, this 'child' is about
                     to eliminate all life on Earth;
                     how do we teach it that that's
                     'wrong'? With a spanking...!?

           Spock peers at McCoy almost sadly, then replies to
           Decker.

                                   SPOCK
                     It doesn't know what it needs,
                     Comm          ander...
                             (to Kirk)
                     It does not know.

           Kirk says nothing, looks at Spock who is awaiting a
           reaction; then Kirk glances at "Ilia" -- his brain
           is racing, struggling to reach a decision. And then:

                                   KIRK
                             (abruptly to

                             (shocked)
                     Jim...!

                                   DECKER
                             (to "Ilia,"
                              urgingly)
                     Ilia... we can help V'ger
                     find what it needs --

           "Ilia" studies Decker just a bland beat, then turns
           to Kirk:

                                   "ILIA"
                             (to Kirk, hard)
                     Disclose the information.
     
                                   KIRK
                             (cool, calm)
                     Not until V'ger withdraws the
                     devices orbiting the third planet.

                                   "ILIA"
                     KIRK UNIT! DISCLOSE THE
                     INFORMATION!

           Kirk studies her a moment, then decides to press his
           bet:

                                   KIRK
                             (to "Ilia," almost
                              pleasant)
                     No.
                             (then to crew
                              commandingly)
                     Secure all stations. Clear
                     the bridge.

           A moment where all are startled at this order -- but
           no time for questions as just then the ship is ROCKED
           BY A FURIOUS POWERFUL ERUPTION NEARBY within V'ger.

                                   DECKER

                     tantrum, Spock.
     
                                   SULU
                     Clear the bridge, Captain...?

                                   KIRK
                     That was the order, Mr. Sulu:
                     Clear the bridge.

           Just then another ERUPTION -- the ship is ROCKED AGAIN.

     337   INT. INSIDE V'GER - THE ENTERPRISE                         337

           rocked about by the furious powerfields -- with
           frightening displays of ray energy.

     338   INT. BRIDGE                                                338

           as all react to the powerful blasts, holding on to 
           railings, etc, at the same time attempting to secure
           their stations for the evacuation. The DAMAGE REPAIR
           TECHNICIAN leaves his station, crossing to exit.

                                   DAMAGE TECH.
                             (leaving bridge;
                              to Captain)
                     Severe stress on engine pylons,
                     sir.

                             (to Kirk; flat)
                     V'ger requires the information.

           Kirk merely looks at her, then to the evacuating crew:

                                   KIRK
                     Bridge secure all stations! 
                     Move out!

                                   McCOY
                     Jim, what the hell kind of
                     strategy is this...?

           Meanwhile, Decker has crossed to Chekov's now abandoned
           console, checks it.

                                   DECKER
                     All ship's functions going to

           turning to confront "Ilia":

                                   KIRK
                     If V'ger destroys the Enterprise,
                     the information V'ger requires
                     will also be destroyed.
 
       339A   INCLUDING VIEWER                                          339A

           as LIGHT SHOW outside perceptically recedes, and simul-
           taneously the ROCKING CEASES. At the same time, "Ilia"
           is saying:

                                   "ILIA"
                     It is illogical to withhold
                     required information.

           Kirk does not reply to this, turns away to observe
           the withdrawing crew. Most are out; only Spock,
           Decker and McCoy remain behind -- with McCoy on his 
           way. The bridge lighting dims, and now Kirk looks at
           Spock, who nods approvingly; clearly Spock is the only
           person who seems to comprehend what Kirk is doing, and
           why. As Kirk now moves toward the exit, and the lights 
           are dimmed even further:

                                   "ILIA"
                             (almost polite)
                     Kirk-unit, why do you not
                     disclose information?

                                   KIRK
                     Because V'ger is going to
                     destroy all the carbon units
                     on the third planet.

                                   "ILIA"
                     They have repressed the Creator.

                                   KIRK
                     The information will not be
                     disclosed.

           And, gesturing the others ahead of him, Kirk starts
           toward the bridge elevator. "Ilia" calls after him:

                                   "ILIA"
                             (almost a plea)
                     V'ger needs the information.

           Decker and McCoy about to enter, Spock and Kirk just
           behind -- all stopping abruptly now at "Ilia's" state-
           ment. The very tone of her voice is enough for them
           to realize they have made a very telling point. Kirk
           follows fast:

                                   KIRK
                     Then V'ger must withdraw its
                     orbiting devices.

                                   "ILIA"
                     V'ger will comply if the carbon
                     units disclose the information.

           wryly reacting to this:

                                   McCOY
                     It learns fast, doesn't it...?

     342   ACROSS McCOY TO KIRK AND SPOCK                             342 

           as Kirk looks at Spock, Kirk's whole expression convey-
           ing the obvious question: "What the hell do we do now?"
           But Spock is ready with an answer:

                                   SPOCK
                     Captain, the vessel -- V'ger --
                     obviously operates from a
                     central brain complex...

           Spock allows the sentence to hang, as he and Kirk
           eye each other significantly, the CAMERA SWINGING
           OVER TO KIRK so we can perceive that to Kirk this
           idea has an even greater significance.

                                   KIRK
                             (to Spock)
                     The orbiting devices would be
                     controlled from the point,
                     then...?

                                   SPOCK
                     Precisely.

           Kirk nods grimly, faces "Ilia" again; this time 
           he's playing for all the stakes.

                                   KIRK
                     The carbon units' information
                     cannot be disclosed to V'ger's
                     probe... only to V'ger directly.

     343   ANOTHER ANGLE - REACTIONS                                  343

           all wait with hushed expectancy, all eyes on "Ilia"
           who seems momentarily in some internal communication.

           She turns away from Kirk and steps forward looking at
           the Main Viewer.

                                   McCOY

           imprisoned. But now, toward the chamber-end, where
           further passage had previously been barred by the lace-
           work energy barriers -- an OPENING APPEARS. And at
           the same time there is a GENTLE LURCHING EFFECT, and:

           "Ilia" steps down from the platform and into the well
           where she is closer to the viewer.

                                   DECKER
                     Captain, what's the next move?

                                   KIRK
                     The question is, Mr. Decker, is
                     there a next move...

     345   INT. V'GER - THE ENTERPRISE                                345

           moving through the chamber, pulled by the invisible
           tractor beam, toward the OPENING -- toward the next
           chamber which, from this POV seems even larger,
           more forbidding.

     346   INT. BRIDGE                                                346

           as the four officers step down onto the bridge, Spock
           hurrying to his science station, Kirk to the center
           seat.

                                   KIRK
                     Resume duty stations, Mr. Decker.

           As Kirk attends to his console, Deck is at an
           intercom:

                                   DECKER
                             (into intercom,
                              voice amplified)
                     All personnel resume stations...!

           At the same time the lights are brightening -- and
           members of the bridge crew begin returning. All this
           time there is an ever increasing sense of movement.
           Kirk glances at Decker:

                                   KIRK
                     Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my
                     bluff is being called.

                                   DECKER
                     I'm afraid our hand is pretty
                     weak, Captain.
                             (slight smile)
                     But it's the only game in town.
     
           Kirk reacts, pleased, a split beat at Decker's "our"
           hand, and goes on:

           Kirk throws him a look of appreciation, then, abruptly
           his manner changes as he addresses Chekov:

                                   KIRK
                     Mr. Chekov, when do those devices
                     activate?

                                   CHEKOV
                     They reach final position in...
                     Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.

                                   KIRK
                             (a beat; then into
                              intercom)
                     Engineering...

     347   INT. ENGINEERING - SCOTT                                   347

           at his console, a female engineering technician (CHIEF
           ROSS) nearby, the usual engine room ambience in the
           b.g., as:

                                   SCOTT
                     Scott, here, sir.

     348   INT. BRIDGE - KIRK WITH AN ANGLE ON SPOCK                  348

           as Kirk hesitates, glances around at the crew -- now
           all having resumed their stations -- and then grimly
           looks at "Ilia" who still remains at the rail.

                                   KIRK
                             (into intercom,
                              eyes on "Ilia")
                     Mr. Scott, be prepared to execute
                     Starfleet order two zero zero
                     five.

           Hearing this, Spock whirls around -- peers incredulously
           at Kirk. He appears for a moment to be incensed at
           Kirk's words. Then he realizes and understands Kirk's
           position and turns, sadly resigned, back to his work.

     349   INT. ENGINEERING                                           349

           as Scott, too, hears this, but his reaction is of grim
           acceptance. Not so Chief Ross; she is horrified.

                                   SCOTT
                             (with a glance at
                              Ross, into intercom)
                     When, Captain?

                                   KIRK'S INTERCOM VOICE
                     On my command.

                                   SCOTT
                             (somberly, into
                              intercom)
                     Aye, sir.

           And Scott hits buttons on his console, now moves to
           step from his station, nearly collides with Ross, who
           clearly is bravely struggling to maintain her poise
           and dignity:

                                   ROSS
                     Why has the Captain ordered self-
                     destruct, sir?

                                   SCOTT
                             (a beat; gently)
                     I would say, lass, because he
                     thinks -- he hopes -- that when
                     we go up... we'll take V'ger
                     with us.

                                   ROSS
                     Will we?

                                   SCOTT
                             (with grim
                              satisfaction)
                     When that much matter and anti-
                     matter are brought together?
                     Oh, yes; we will, indeed.

     350   EXT. ENTERPRISE - INT. V'GER                               350

           The ship passing now through a chamber that is vastly
           more active than anything we have previously seen.
           Directly ahead appears to be an area that dispatches
           powerfields; a tremendous volume of them seem to ema-
           nate and converge there. The medium from which the
           ship moves appears almost solid, to the point where it
           seems incredible that the ship can be pulled through
           it at all. The entire chamber pulses with machine-
           like, alien life. This should even be evidenced in the
           booming POWERFIELD LIGHTENING BOLTS as they course in
           ever more frighteningly close proximity to the ship as:

       350A   INT BRIDGE - INCLUDING THE VIEWER                         350A

           The crew all watching the awesome spectacle of V'ger's
           interior (on the viewer) as the Enterprise is being
           pulled toward the brain complex. All are somewhat sub-
           dued, for all realize how their journey will end -- but
           at the same time they also realize there is no other
           way. The CAMERA PANS, catching facial reactions -- as,
           in the b.g., we HEAR a constant flow of AD-LIBBED crew
           comments:

                                   CHEKOV
                     Twenty-five minutes to device
                     activation, sir.

     ALT. (Twenty-two)
     ALT. (Eighteen)

                                   UHURA
                     Starfleet has been apprised of 
                     our situation, Captain.

                                   SULU
                     Tractor beam remains constant...

                                   DIFALCO
                     We are seventeen kilometers inside
                     the vessel...

     351   ANGLE ON SPOCK                                             351

           His back to the viewer, the angle does not reveal his
           facial features, but we can discern him struggling to
           contain his feelings.

     352   WIDER ANGLE (INCLUDE KIRK, McCOY, AND DECKER)              352

           Kirk's back to Spock as he watches the viewer, Kirk
           now turning toward Spock.

                                   KIRK
                     Spock... Spock...

           Spock does not respond, then Kirk reacts with momentary
           annoyance, then realizes Spock is totally distracted.
           Kirk peers at him a moment, then suddenly rises and
           steps up to:

     353   SPOCK'S STATION - KIRK AND SPOCK (McCOY IN B.G.)           353

           as Kirk arrives, with Spock still facing away from
           him, clearly distracted.

                                   KIRK
                             (starts)
                     Mr. Spock -- I think...

           Spock moves to face him, turning fully INTO the CAMERA
           so we can see now, just under Spock's eye:

           A tear! Welling fom the eye, rolling down his cheek.
           Kirk is speechless a moment, glances at McCoy who has
           also witnessed this phenomenon, and started toward
           Spock; but Kirk gestures McCoy to stay back, as he
           addresses Spock:

                                   KIRK
                             (quiet, feeling)
                     Not for us?

                                   SPOCK
                     No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
     
           Spock pauses as Kirk peers incredulously at him, then
           continues:

                                   SPOCK
                             (continuing)
                     I weep for V'ger, as I would for
                     a brother -- far more knowledgeable
                     than I -- and yet one step behind.

     354   ANGLE ON McCOY AND DECKER                                  354

           Listening, McCoy's face reflecting concern; Decker's
           face compassion and understanding, with Decker step-
           ping closer to Spock, as Spock continues:

                                   SPOCK
                     As I was -- when I came aboard...
                     so is V'ger now: empty, incomplete.
                     Searching. Logic and knowledge are
                     not enough.

                                   McCOY
                             (with empathy)
                     Spock, are you saying that you
                     found, what you needed -- but V'ger
                     hasn't?

                                   SPOCK
                     Has not, Doctor -- and now, because
                     of what we are planning... will not...

                                   KIRK
                             (almost hard)
                     There is no alternative.

                                   DECKER
                             (gently pressing)
                     Mr. Spock, what would V'ger need
                     to fulfill itself?

                                   SPOCK
                     V'ger has begun to understand the
                     true limits of our universe,
                     thereby realizing the existence
                     of other dimensions. To fulfill
                     itself it must evolve to a
                     higher dimension; V'ger believes
                     this can be achieved only by
                     joining with the Creator.

                                   SPOCK (ALTERNATIVE)
                     Each of us, at some time in our
                     life, turns to someone, a father,
                     a brother, a God and asks 'Why
                     am I here?' 'What was I meant
                     to be?' V'ger hopes to touch its
                     Creator to find its answers.

     355   ACROSS KIRK TO DECKER                                      355

           as Decker reacts with sudden, almost evangelical en-
           lightenment, as Kirk Says:

                                   KIRK
                             (understanding)
                     'Is this all that I am? Is there
                     nothing more?

           ON DIFALCO

           reacting to the (O.S.) viewer, AD-LIBBING a terse:

                                   DIFALCO
                     Captain...!

           PAST KIRK AND SPOCK TO THE VIEWER
     
           where another opening is suddenly visible -- another
           chamber. But the violent and color energy effects of
           the previous chambers are no longer evident. Instead,
           the entire chamber appears beautifully symmetrical,
           with a strange, subdued glow, which increases as we
           move closer.

                                   SPOCK
                             (flat)
                     Captain, I believe that is our
                     destination.
     
     356   EXT. ENTERRISE - INT. V'GER - NEAR THE "ISLAND"            356
           COMPLEX

           This enormous chamber resembles a hemisphere, laced
           throughout with dazzling energy patterns, not at all
           ominous, but quite lovely in effect. As the Enterprise
           continues forward motion, now ahead you will to SEE a
           small "island." Floating in the exact center of the
           hemisphere, the "island" seems alive with PULSING LIGHT,
           with more of the lovely and delicate ENERGY FORMS and
           COLORS. On the "island," vague at this distance, ap
           pears to be a "solid" matter form.

     357   INT. BRIDGE - INCLUDING VIEWER                             357

           The "island" looming larger in the distance. And the
           Enterprise (as evidenced from the viewer) perceptibly
           slowing. Kirk just resuming his command chair, as:
                       
                                   SULU
                     Forward motion slowing, Captain...!

           Kirk says nothing a moment, studies the viewer -- and
           then:

                                   KIRK
                             (into intercom)

           Between them a total look of understanding.

           The Enterprise approaching the edge of the "island" --
           slowing, but still quite clearly being pulled by the
           tractor beam. The "solid matter" in the "island" cen-
           ter still obscured by the STRANGE LIGHT GLOW emanating
           from that area. The Enterprise is now nearly at the
           "island" edge.

           Kirk glances at the Viewer, the oncoming "island," then
           at Spock:

                                   KIRK
                             (shakes head, no)
     (ALT: "19",)    (Mr. Spock), if we do not provide
     (     "15  )    V'ger with certain information, we
                     won't have twenty-two seconds; the
                     plan must be implemented upon arrival.

                                   DECKER
                     Captain, we can't be sure that our...

                                   KIRK
                     No!

           Decker's last word is interrupted by an almost gentle
           BUMP -- and on the Viewer all perceptible motion has
           stopped. At the same time:

                                   SULU
                     Forward motion stopped, Captain.

           all very silent a moment, gazing at the sight. Now
           Kirk glances at the people around him: on his command
           their lives are about to end. Nothing is said; no
           time for it, no inclination to articulate the obvious.
           No need to.

                     Captain... I read an oxygen and

                     Sir, I have located the source
                     of V'ger's radio signal: (it's)
                     directly ahead.

                                   SPOCK
                     That transmitter is a vital link
                     between V'ger and the Creator.

      (ALT. "18",)   We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,
      (.... "14" )   we can still save V'ger... and ourselves. 

           All this has caused Kirk to vacillate, but he still
           believes his course of action is the proper one, as:-

                                   "ILIA"
                     The carbon units will now provide 
                     V'ger the required information.

           "Ilia" is moving toward the elevator, turning to face
           the others as she says this. Kirk remains frozen, his
           hand on the intercom button. He glances at McCoy, as
           though seeking advice. McCoy peers at him blandly,
           levelly; Kirk must follow his own instinct.

           gazing at "Ilia," then at Spock, his brain racing, con-
           sidering all the possibilities, options. He glances
           at the anxious faces awaiting his decision: a possible
           twenty-two more minutes of life -- or instant death.
           Another beat as he decides. Then:

                                   KIRK
                             (into intercom)

                              Spock and McCoy)
                     Spock, Bones...

           He starts for elevator.

     366   PAST DECKER TO KIRK                                        366

           as Kirk strides toward the elevator, joining McCoy and
           Spock.

                                   KIRK
                     Mr. Decker... I will contact you
                     every five minutes. Otherwise...
                     inform Mr. Scott immediately.

                                   DECKER
                             (calls after him)
                     Captain... I'd like to go along...

           Kirk studies Decker a beat -- there is something com-
           pelling about Decker's manner -- a certain sense of
           absolute necessity. Kirk seems about to deny the re-
           quest, then turns to Sulu:

                                   KIRK
                     Mr. Sulu, you have the conn...

           And Kirk leaves; Decker, his face reflecting a strange,
           almost eager gratification, hurries after him.

                                   KIRK
                     V'ger plans to literally meld
                     to reduce both itself and the
                     Creator to patterns...

                                   SPOCK
                     ... and then to reassemble itself
                     combined with the Creator. The
                     most certain way of obtaining
                     all the Creator's answers.

           A sudden STORM OF LIGHT AND STRANGE SOUND. In the
           midst of it, Kirk finds a SHAFT OF LIGHT very much
           centering on him. He sees "Ilia" watching him with
           none of their "former navigator" in her expression
           now. Kirk hesitates, gathering his thoughts:

                                   KIRK
                             (to "Ilia")

                     Answer!

                                   KIRK
                     We will answer and present proof
                     of our answer when it is ready!

           Kirk's words lead to a suggestion of FRUSTRATION in the
           STORM OF LIGHT AND SOUND around them.

                                   KIRK
                             (continuing)
                     V'ger, we will bring the Creator
                     to you! Here!

                     We need only a few more minutes.
                     Believe me...

           Decker has reached out to touch her -- the probe spins
           at his touch -- the move knocks Decker from his feet,
           tumbling, a hard fall. Then the robe looks at him
           lying there -- just the slightest softening of her
           features now.

     368   EMPHASIZING DECKER                                         368

                                   DECKER
                     Ilia, believe me... the Creator

           as she meets Decker's look, her expression softening
           still more. The STORM OF LIGHT and SOUND begins to
           subside a bit. She moves to him and he gets to his feet.

                     And when it realizes what the

           open. Decker peers inside while "Ilia" waits.

           The three of them exchange looks -- Kirk, Spock and
           McCoy exchanging a silent moment of friendship and
           resignation. Then Kirk lifts his communicator again:

           his tricorder. Both he and "Ilia" are watching Kirk
           and the others closely. Now Decker looks down at the

           still waiting. They continue to wait. McCoy shifts
           uncomfortably, throws Kirk a puzzled glance. Kirk
           finally lifts his communicator.

                                   KIRK
                     Enterprise, are you transmitting?

                                   UHURA'S INTERCOM VOICE
                     Affirmative, Captain. For some
                     time now.

                                   KIRK
                     Confirm code and transmitting

                                   CHEKOV'S INTERCOM VOICE
                     Both signal and frequency
                     confirmed, sir.

                                   DECKER
                             (calling)
                     Captain Kirk!

     378   VARIOUS ANGLES                                             378

           as the others turn to Decker and "Ilia."

                                   DECKER
                             (continuing)
                     The fault is here, sir, not in
                     the transmission.
                             (indicating into
                              hatch)
                     The antenna leads have been
                     disconnected. V'ger never
                     intended to accept a transmitted
                     signal.

                                   KIRK
                     Capture God! In order to
                     retrieve V'ger's data, the
                     Creator has to physically come
                     here!...

                                   DECKER
                     And plug the signal directly into
                     the circuitry at this...
                             (indicates into
                              access)
                     ... point here, Captain. It
                     should pick up even a tricorder
                     playback.

                                   KIRK
                             (lifting communicator)
                     Enterprise, I want that signal
                     again. Transmit!

           Then Kirk touches a control on his tricorder exactly
           as Decker did earlier. Then he looks up, reacts as
           he sees Decker holding his own tricorder up -- and a
           smile playing on Decker's face.

     379   ACTION ANGLE                                               379

           as Kirk suddenly pivots, races toward Decker -- but he
           passes too close to the "Ilia"-probe. It sends him
           spinning back, tumbling to his knees.

     380   AT KIRK                                                    380

           as KIRK starts up to scramble to his feet but Spock has
           stepped in, putting a hand on Kirk's shoulder and re
           straining him.

                                   SPOCK
                     Jim... he wants it.

                                   DECKER
                     You got the Enterprise, it's
                     what you wanted. This is what
                     I want.
                                   (smiles)
                     But, Jim...
                                   (now very seriously)
                     ... I'm the right choice for this
                     mission.

           And then Decker shoves the tricorder into the access
           hatch.

     381   VARIOUS EFFECTS SHOTS - DECKER BEING FUSED - V'GER         381
           TRANSCENDING (S)

           For just an instant nothing happens -- and then a 
           BLINDING SHAFT OF LIGHT STRIKES Decker. The color
           becomes BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER, begins spiraling through
           the room. "Ilia" stes toward Decker, is caught in the
           LIGHT, and instantly VANISHES in a BRILLIANT WHITE GLOW.

           We SEE Decker seeming to grow larger -- as if his
           molecular pattern is expanding. A SPECTACULAR SERIES
           OF VISUALS., THE SPIRALING LIGHT enveloping the entire
           area.

           All this emanating from Decker's body, becoming LARGER
           -- also BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER until now it is almost
           transparent. And the SPIRALING now expanding in all
           directions, and the room itself starting to dissolve,
           vanishing into nothingness -- and all commencing to
           slip into the new dimension.

           Kirk, Spock and McCoy stand transfixed another instant.
           Around them, V'ger seems to be TRANSFORMING INTO BRIL-
           LIANT, LOVELY PATTERNS. They all turn and race into
           the complex in the direction of their vessel.

     382   EXT. EARTH ORBIT - AN ENERGY BOLT (S)                      382

           It too seems to be flowering into loveliness, brilliant,
           graceful patterns as they seem to slip through to another 
           dimension, vanishing.

     383   EXT. V'GER - FULL SHOT                                     383
     
           The "FLOWERING" EFFECT now spreading outward, V'ger's
           massive shape becoming a spiraling pattern of twisting,
           graceful shapes and brilliant colors -- a transcendence
           into another dimension.
           And then all of that is left is a shimmering, jewel-like
           point of light -- and then it too fades -- and reveals
           there in the blue-black of space, the U.S.S. Enterprise.

     384   INT. BRIDGE - INCLUDING THE VIEWER (O)                     384

           which shows now only space and its familiar star
           patterns. All gaze at the viewer, awed at what they've
           seen and undergone. They exchange looks silently, no
           one wanting to be the first to try to comment on some-
           thing which is beyond mere words. We HEAR an ELEVATOR
           DOOR, Scott and Chapel ENTER the bridge and stand 
           silently watching.

                                   McCOY
                     Well, it certainly has been...
                     interesting.

                                   KIRK
                     Spock, we were its answer!

                                   SPOCK
                             (nods)
                     Yes, Captain. It needed our
                     mortality, the fear of it, our
                     struggle against it, our fears,
                     our dreams...

                                   KIRK
                     ... and the 'foolish' emotions
                     which drive us?

                                   SPOCK
                             (looks at Kirk; then)
                     I prefer your poet Dante's phrase
                     -- 'the divine restlessness of
                     the human spirit.'

                                   McCOY
                     Spock... you're quoting poetry?

           Spock's cold look at McCoy is interrupted by:

                                   UHURA
                     Starfleet signal, Captain!
                     Return to orbital dockyard for
                     inspection.

                                   KIRK
                     Ignore that signal.
                             (to Scott)
                     Shall we give the Enterprise a
                     proper shakedown, Mr. Scott?

                                   SCOTT
                             (suddenly beaming)
                     I'd say it's time for that, I
                     would, sir.
                             (toward Spock)
                     We can have you back on Vulcan
                     in four days, Mr. Spock.

                                   SPOCK
                             (coolly)
                     I have no business on Vulcan,
                     Engineer.

           Kirk and Spock exchange a look -- then Kirk turns to
           the helm.

                                   KIRK
                     Ahead Warp One, Mr. Sulu.

                                   DIFALCO
                     Heading, sir?

                                   KIRK
                             (taking center seat;
                              indicates generally)
                     Out there.  Thataway.

                                   SPOCK
                             (nods gravely)
                     A most logical choice, Captain.

           Then the trace of a smile comes over Spock's face.

     385   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (S)                                385

           Planet Earth in the distance, and receding in size as
           the starship heads out the other direction.

           FADE OUT.

                                   THE END
