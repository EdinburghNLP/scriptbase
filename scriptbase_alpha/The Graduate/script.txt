1     EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - DAY
     SHOT - HELICOPTER'S POV -

     Moving through clouds.  The clouds separate and, far below, we can
     see a giant outdoor amphitheatre.  There is no SOUND but the WIND.
     As we move closer to the amphitheatre, we can hear SNATCHES OF WORDS
     and PHRASES as though from a public address system.

2     EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - PODIUM - DAY - SHOT OF BEN

     in cap and gown, standing in front of a microphone.  The WIND is
     BLOWING.  He has to hold on to the papers from which he is reading.

3     EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - SHOT OF AUDIENCE - DAY

     Thousands of expressionless STUDENTS are sitting there.

4     EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - SHOT OF PODIUM - DAY

          BEN
     - and today it is right that we
     should ask ourselves the one most
     important question: What is the
     purpose of these years, the purpose
     for all this demanding work,
     the purpose for the sacrifices
     made those who love us?  Were
     there NOT a purpose, then all of
     these past years of struggle, of
     fierce competition and of uncom-
     promising ambition would be mean-
     ingless.  But, of course, there
     is a purpose and I must tell it
     to you.  I ask you to remember
     this purpose always and I pledge
     that I shall endeavor to carry it
     with me forever.

5     SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE AUDIENCE - DAY

     staring at him impassively.

6     INTERCUT BETWEEN SHOTS

     of impassive students, seated, watching; of Ben standing
     alone on the huge amphitheatre stage; of CLOSEUPS of Ben
     speaking; of loudspeakers; of wind-blown papers on the
     podium.

7     EXT. PODIUM OF AMPHITHEATRE - DAY

          BEN
          (continuing)
     The purpose, my fellow graduates -
     the purpose is -

     He stops, trying to think of the word.

8     CLOSEUP - BEN

     He begins to sweat.

9     SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE AUDIENCE

     watching.

10     SHOT - PODIUM of AMPHITHEATRE

     Ben's hands searching through the pages of his speech.
     The pages begin to blow away in the wind.

11     SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE AUDIENCE - DAY

     staring.

12     SHOT - PODIUM OF AMPHITHEATRE - DAY

          BEN
     - there is a reason, my friends,
     and the reason is -

13     CLOSEUP - BEN

     He is in a panic.  He looks up from his papers at the audience.

14     SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE - DAY

     The audience is gone.

15     SHOT - PODIUM OF AMPHITHEATRE - DAY

          BEN
     - the reason is - the purpose is -

     SOUND of the WIND becoming the ROAR of an AIRCRAFT coming at
     us through the air.

16     SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE - DAY

     Huge and empty.  SOUND of AIRCRAFT.

          CAPTAIN'S VOICE

     Ladies and gentlemen, we are about
     to begin our descent into Los Angeles -

     SOUND of a SONIC BOOM.

                              CUT TO:

17     INT. PLANE - CLOSEUP - BEN - NIGHT

     His eyes open suddenly.

          CAPTAIN'S VOICE
     The sound you have just heard is the
     landing gear locking into place.  The
     Los Angeles weather is clear and the
     temperature is a pleasant 72.  We do
     not expect any traffic delay and will
     make our four hour and eighteen minute
     flight plan smack on the nose.  We
     enjoyed having you on board and look
     forward to seeing you again in the near
     future.

18     SHOT

     PULL BACK SLOWLY from a CLOSEUP of a television screen with
     snow on it to reveal a long row of television sets along the
     ceiling of the aircraft.  There is snow on all of them.

19     REVERSE ANGLE

     PULL BACK from the CLOSEUP of Ben to reveal a row of passengers
     staring straight ahead, their headsets on.  Ben turns and
     looks out the window.

20     EXT. LOS ANGELES - FROM THE AIR - NIGHT

     Los Angeles, at night, its lights stretching endlessly in every
     direction.

     SOUND - MUZAC and the STEWARDESS' LANDING SPEECH.

     START OF MAIN TITLES

     UNDER titles:

          STEWARDESS' VOICE
     Ladies and gentlemen please fasten your
     seat belts in preparation for the landing
     and observe the no smoking sign.  After
     we land, you will notice an increase in
     the sound level as the thrust of the engines
     is reversed to help reduce forward speed.

21     INT. AIRPORT - MOVING SIDEWALK - NIGHT

     Ben and the other passengers on the automatic sidewalk.

          MAN'S VOICE
     Your attention, please!  American Airlines
     Flight Number 4, 21 Club service, non-stop
     to New York is now leaving from Gate
     Number 40.  All aboard, please.

28     INT. BEN'S ROOM - NIGHT - CLOSEUP - BEN

     His eyes are open and he is trying to remember something.
     There are the SOUNDS of many people TALKING and LAUGHING
     in other rooms.  A RADIO nearby PLAYS MUSIC.  After a
     while, there is the SOUND of a DOOR OPENING.  The SOUNDS
     of the people TALKING are lower.  MRS. TERHUNE'S voice
     can be heard among them.

          MRS. TERHUNE'S VOICE

     -- associate editor of the college
     newspaper in his junior year -
     managing editor in his senior
     year -

     The SOUND of the DOOR CLOSING.  Mrs. Terhune's VOICE and
     the VOICES of the other guests FADE DOWN.  Mrs. Terhune's
     VOICE can be HEARD with varying clarity through the
     remainder of the sequence.

     After a few moments, there is the SOUND of a LIGHT SWITCH
     being SNAPPED and light, as though from an overhead fixture,
     falls across BEN's face.  He does not move.

     After a few moments, there is the SOUND of the RADIO being
     SNAPPED OFF.

          MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
     What's the matter?

     Ben's mouth opens a little bit and closes again.

          MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
     The guests are all downstairs,
     Ben.  They're all waiting to see you.

          BEN
     Look, Dad - could you explain to
     them that I have to be alone for
     a while?

          MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
     These are all our good friends,
     Ben.  Most of them have known you
     since - well - practically since
     you were born.

     Ben has not moved.  Now the bed on which he is lying moves
     as though someone has sat down upon it next to him.

          MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
     What is it, Ben?

     The CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL BACK SLOWLY.

          BEN
     I'm just -

          MR. BRADDOCK
     - worried?

          BEN
     Well -

          MR. BRADDOCK
     About what?

          Ben
     I guess - about my future.

          MR. BRADDOCK
     What about it?

          BEN
     I don't know.  I want it to be -

          MR. BRADDOCK
     To be what?

          BEN
          (quietly)
     Different.

     As Ben says this, the door to the bedroom opens and
     MRS. BRADDOCK looks in.

          MRS. BRADDOCK
     Is anything wrong?

          MR. BRADDOCK
     No!  No - we're just on our way
     downstairs!

     Mr. Braddock gets off the bed and goes to a chair and
     picks up Ben's jacket which is lying across it.

          MRS. BRADDOCK
     The Carlsons' are here.

          MR. BRADDOCK
          (to Mrs. Braddock)
     They are?
          (to Ben)
     Come on.

     Mr. Braddock puts the jacket on Ben.

          MRS. BRADDOCK
     They came all the way from
     Tarzana.

          MR. BRADDOCK
     It's a wonderful thing to have
     so many devoted friends.

     They move out of the door, Mr. Braddock steering Ben.

29     INT. HALLS AND STAIRWAY - NIGHT

     PHIL and MIMI CARLSON are coming up the stairs as the
     Braddocks are moving down.

          MR. CARLSON
     Hey - there's our award winning
     scholar.

          MRS. CARLSON
     We're all very proud of you,
     Ben.

          BEN
     Thank you, Mrs. Carlson.

          MR. CARLSON
     Is that the new car out there?
     The little red Wop job?

          MR. BRADDOCK
     That's Ben's graduation present.

          MR. CARLSON
          (putting his arm
          across Ben's shoulder)
     Won't have much trouble picking
     them up in that, will you?

          BEN
     Sir?

          MR. CARLSON
     The girls.  The chicks.  The -
     the teeny boppers.

          MRS. CARLSON
     I think Ben has gotten beyond
     the teeny bopper stage - haven't
     you, Ben?

     Mrs. Carlson gives Ben a broad wink.  Ben tries to smile
     and return the wink politely.

          BEN
     Yes, ma'am.

     They reach the hall at the bottom of the stairs.

          BEN
     Excuse me - I think I'd just
     like to check something on
     the car for a minute -

     Ben moves to the front door and opens it.  MR. LOOMIS
     steps into the house and grabs Ben's hand.

          MR. LOOMIS
     Here's the track star himself.
     How are you, track star?

          BEN
     Just fine, Mr. Loomis.

     Mr. Loomis closes the door and pushes Ben back down the
     hall.

          MR. LOOMIS
     I want to get a drink and then
     I want to hear all about that
     thing you won.  That Hopperman
     award.

          BEN
     Helpingham.

          MR. LOOMIS
     Helpingham!  Right!  Now you
     wait right here.

     Mr. Loomis turns and goes into the dining room.  Ben
     moves back to the stairway as THREE LADIES come out of
     the living room.  One lady takes Ben's right hand, another
     lady his left, the third fingers the front of his jacket.

          LADY 1
     Ben - we're all so proud of
     you.

          LADY 2
     Proud, proud, proud, proud,
     proud.

          LADY 3
     What are you going to do now?

          BEN
     I was going to go upstairs for a
     minute -

          LADY 3
     No - I meant with your future.

          LADY 2
     With your life.

          BEN
     Well - that's a little hard to say -

     MR. MCQUIRE appears behind Ben.

          MR. MCQUIRE
     Ben!

          Ben
          (to the ladies)
     Excuse me.
          (he turns around)
     Mr. McQuire

          MR. MCQUIRE
          (overwhelmed with pride)
     Ben.

          BEN
     Mr. McQuire.

     Mr. McQuire takes Ben's arm and steers him down the hall
     toward the back of the house and out through the back door.

30     EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - NIGHT

     The pool is eerily lit.  There are FOUR PEOPLE standing and
     TALKING, drinks in their hands, at the back of the yard.

          MR. MCQUIRE
     Ben - I just want to say one word to
     you - just one word -

          BEN
     Yes, sir.

          MR. MCQUIRE
     Are you listening?

          BEN
     Yes I am.

          MR. MCQUIRE
          (gravely)
     Plastics.

     They look at each other for a moment.

          BEN
     Exactly how do you mean?

          MR. MCQUIRE
     There is a great future in plastics.
     Think about it.  Will you think
     about it?

          BEN
     Yes, I will.

          MR. MCQUIRE
     Okay.  Enough said.  That's a deal.

     Mr. McQuire turns and walks back into the house.  The
     people at the other end of the yard look toward Ben.

          WOMAN #1
     Here he is now.  Here's Ben.

          BEN
     Excuse me just a minute -

     Ben goes into the house through the back door.

31     EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - NIGHT

     We can see through the windows of the house, Ben making his
     way through people trying to stop him and speak to him as he
     goes through rooms, up the stairs and to his room.

     SOUND of a door SLAMMING.

32     INT. - EXT. BEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Ben stands with his back against the door.  The SOUNDS of the
     PARTY downstairs and, as Ben walks across the room to a
     window, the SOUND of the WIND.

32A     SHOT - LONG SHOT (Location)

     Over Ben to pool area and people below.  SOUND of the door
     OPENING.  Ben turns.  MRS. ROBINSON enters the room.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Oh.  I guess this isn't the
     bathroom, is it?

          BEN
     It's down the hall.

     They stand for a moment, loocking at each other.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     How are you, Benjamin?

          BEN
     Fine, thank you.  The bathroom is
     down at the end of the hall.

     Mrs. Robinson moves into the room and sits on the edge
     of the bed.

          BEN
     Look, Mrs. Robinson, I don't
     mean to be rude but -

     Mrs. Robinson takes a cigarette from her purse and
     lights it.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Is there an ashtray in here?

          BEN
     No.
          MRS. ROBINSON
     Oh - I forgot.  The track star
     doesn't smoke.

     She blows out the match and puts it down carefully on
     the bedspread.  Ben picks up a wastebasket, walks over
     to the bed, picks up the match and puts it in the
     wastebasket.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Is it a girl?

          BEN
     Is what a girl?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Whatever it is you're upset
     about.

          BEN
     Oh - no.  I'm just sort of
     disturbed about things.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     In general.

          BEN
     That's right.

     There is a long pause.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Benjamin, I want to ask you
     something.

          BEN
     What?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Will you take me home?

          BEN
     What?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     My husband took the car.  Will
     you drive me home?

     Ben reaches into his pocket and hands Mrs. Robinson
     a set of car keys.

          BEN
     Here - you take it.

     Mrs. Robinson looks at him.

          BEN
     Do you know how to work a
     foreign shift?

     Mrs. Robinson shakes her head.

          BEN
     You don't?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     No.
          (there is a pause)

          BEN
     Let's go.

     She throws the keys to him.  He catches them.

                              CUT TO:

33     EXT. BRADDOCK HOUSE - NIGHT

     SHOOTING THROUGH THE OPEN FRONT DOOR.  Mr. Braddock is
     talking to the Terhunes at the door.  Ben and Mrs.
     Robinson come down the hall.

          BEN
     Dad - Mrs. Robinson needs a ride
     home.  I'll be right back.

     Mr. Braddock pats Ben on the shoulder.  Mrs. Robinson
     is walking ahead through the front door.

          MRS. ROBINSON
          (as she passes the
          CAMERA)
     Wonderful party.

                              CUT TO:

34     OMITTED

35     EXT. ROBINSON HOUSE - NIGHT

     The car comes to a stop in the Robinson driveway.  They sit
     for a moment.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Thank you.

          BEN
     Right.

     She doesn't move.  Ben gets out and goes around to her side
     and opens the door.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Will you come in, please?

          BEN
     What?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     I want you to come in till I get
     the lights on.

          BEN
     What for?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Because I don't feel safe until
     I get the lights on.

     They move to the door.  She takes out her key and opens
     the door.

36     INT. ROBINSON HALL AND SUNROOM - NIGHT

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Would you mind walking ahead of
     me to the sun porch.  I feel
     funny about coming into a dark
     house.

          BEN
     But it's light in there now.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Please.

     Ben turns and walks down the hall.  They enter sunroom.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     What do you drink?  Bourbon?

          BEN
     Look - I drove you home.  I was
     glad to do it.  But I have some
     things on my mind.  Can you
     understand that?

     She nods.

          BEN
     All right then.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     What do you drink?

     He looks at her.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Benjamin - I'm sorry to be this
     way, but I don't want to be
     alone in this house.

          BEN
     Why not?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Please wait till my husband
     gets home.

          BEN
     When is he coming back?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     I don't know.

     She pours herself a drink.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Drink?

          BEN
     No.

     She hands him a drink.  There is a pause.

          BEN
     Are you always this much afraid
     of being alone?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Yes.

          BEN
     Well, why can't you just lock
     the doors and go to bed?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     I'm very nuerotic.

     She turns on the phonograph.  SOUND of PHONOGRAPH.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     May I ask you a question?

     Ben looks at her.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     What do you think of me?

          BEN
     What do you mean?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     You've known me nearly all of
     your life.  You must have
     formed some opinion.

          BEN
     Well - I've always thought
     that you were a very - nice -
     person.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Did you know I was an alcoholic?

          BEN
     What?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Did you know that?

          BEN
     Look - I think I should be
     going -

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Sit down, Benjamin.

          BEN
     Mrs. Robinson - if you don't
     mind my saying so - this
     conversation is getting a
     little strange.  Now I'm sure
     that Mr. Robinson will be here
     any minute and -

          MRS. ROBINSON
     No.

          BEN
     What?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     My husband will be back quite
     late.

     They look at each other.  Ben is half standing.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     He should be gone for several
     hours.

     She takes a step toward him.  He puts his hand up and
     retreats around the other side of the chair.

          BEN
     Oh my God.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Pardon?

          BEN
     Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     What's wrong?

          BEN
     Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -
     I mean you didn't expect -

          MRS. ROBINSON
     What?

          BEN
     I mean - you didn't really
     think that I would do something
     like that.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Like what?

          BEN
     What do you think?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Well I don't know.

          BEN
     For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson,
     here we are, you've got me into
     your house.  You give me a
     drink.  You put on music, now
     you start opening up your
     personal life to me and tell
     me your husband won't be home
     for hours.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     So?

          BEN
     Mrs. Robinson - you are trying
     to seduce me.

     There is a pause.  She looks at him.

          BEN
          (weaker)
     Aren't you?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Why no.  I hadn't thought of it.
     I feel rather flattered that
     you -

          BEN
     Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive
     me for what I just said?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     It's all right.

          BEN
     It's not all right, it's the
     worst thing I've ever said
     to anyone.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Sit down.

          BEN
     Please forgive me.  Because I
     like you.  I don't think of you
     that way.  But I'm mixed up.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     All right.  Now finish your drink.

          BEN
     Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick
     that I said that to you.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     We'll forget it right now.
     Finish your drink.

          BEN
     What is wrong with me?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Have you ever seen Elaine's
     portrait?

          BEN
     Her portrait?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Yes.

          BEN
     No.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     We had it done last Christmas.
     Would you like to see it?

          BEN
     Very much.

     We move with Mrs. Robinson and Ben out of the sunroom,
     into the hall, up the stairs and along the hall to
     the doorway to Elaine's room.

37     INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Ben moves into the room and looks up at the portrait.

          BEN
     Elaine certainly is an
     attractive girl, isn't she?

     In the b.g. Mrs. Robinson watches him.

          BEN
          (looking at the
          portrait)
     I don't remember her as having
     brown eyes.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Benjamin?

          BEN
     Yes?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Will you unzip my dress?

     He steps back.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     I think I'll go to bed.

          BEN
     Oh.  Well, goodnight.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Won't you unzip my dress?

          BEN
     I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     If you still think I'm trying
     to seduce you -

          BEN
     No, I don't.  But I just feel
     a little funny.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Benjamin - you've known me all
     your life.

          BEN
     I know that.  But I'm -

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Come on.

     She turns her back.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     It's hard for me to reach.

     Ben reaches forward and pulls the zipper down.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Thank you.

          BEN
     Right.

     Ben walks toward the door.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     What are you so scared of?

          BEN
     I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Then why do you keep running
     away?

          BEN
     Because you're going to bed.  I
     don't think I should be up here.

     Mrs. Robinson lets her dress fall to the floor.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Haven't you ever seen anybody
     in a slip before?

          BEN
     Yes, I have -

     He looks up at the portrait of Elaine.

          BEN
     But I just - Look - what if Mr.
     Robinson walked in right now?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     What if he did?

          BEN
     Well, it would look pretty
     funny, wouldn't it?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Don't you think he trusts us
     together?

          BEN
     Of course he does.  But he
     might get the wrong idea.
     Anyone might.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     I don't see why.  I'm twice as
     old as you are.  How could
     anyone think -

          BEN
     But they would!  Don't you see?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Benjamin - I'm not trying to
     seduce you.  I wish you'd -

          BEN
     I know that.  But please, Mrs.
     Robinson.  This is difficult
     for me.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Why is it?

          BEN
     Because I am confused about
     things.  I can't tell what
     I'm imagining.  I can't tell
     what's real.  I can't -

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Would you like me to seduce you?

          BEN
     What?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Is that what you're trying to
     tell me?

          BEN
     I'm going home now.  I apologize
     for what I said.  I hope you can
     forget it.  But I'm going home
     right now.

     Benjamin walks out of the door and down the hall.  The
     CAMERA PUSHES with him to the door.  We see the entire
     stairway and part of the downstairs hall.  Ben gets to
     the stairs and starts down.

          MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
     BENJAMIN?

          BEN
     Yes.

          MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
     Will you bring up my purse before
     you go?

          BEN
     I have to go now.  I'm sorry.

     Mrs. Robinson walks into the hall.  Her back is to us.
     She is holding her dress in front of her.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     I really don't want to put this
     on again.  Won't you bring it
     up?

          BEN
     Where is it?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     On that chair in the hall.

     She walks out of the shot.

          BEN
     Mrs. Robinson?

          MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
     I'm in the bathroom.

          BEN
     Well here's the purse.

          MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
     Could you bring it up?

          BEN
     Well I'll hand it to you.

     Ben starts back up the stairs.

          BEN
     Come to the railing and I'll
     hand it up.

          MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
     Benjamin - I am getting pretty
     tired of all this suspicion.
     Now if you won't do me a simple
     favor I don't know what.

     Ben appears as he slowly climbs the stairs.

          BEN
     I'm putting it on the top step.

          MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
     For God's sake, Benjamin, will
     you stop acting that way and
     bring me the purse?

     Ben gets to the top of the stairs, and starts slowly
     down the hall.

          BEN
     I'm putting it here by the door.

          MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
     Will you bring it in to me?

          BEN
     I'd rather not.

          MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
     All right.  Put it in the room
     where we were.

          BEN
     Right.

38     INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Ben walks quickly into Elaine's room, crosses to the
     bed and puts the purse down.  As he starts to turn
     back, he looks up at Elaine's portrait.  There is a
     movement reflected in the glass of the portrait.  He
     turns quickly.  Mrs. Robinson, naked, is shutting the
     door to the bedroom behind her.

          BEN
     Oh God.

     She smiles.

          BEN
     Let me out.

     She turns the lock on the door.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Don't be nervous.

          BEN
     Get away from that door.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     I want to say something first.

          BEN
     Jesus Christ!

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Benjamin - I want you to know
     I'm available to you.  If you
     won't sleep with me this time -

          BEN
     Oh my God.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     If you won't sleep with me this
     time, Benjamin, I want you to
     know you can call me up any
     time you want and we'll make
     some kind of arrangement.

          BEN
     Let me out!

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Do you understand what I said?

          BEN
     Yes.  Yes.  Let me out!

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Because I find you very attractive
     and any time -

     There is the SOUND of a CAR in the driveway outside.
     Ben leaps at the door, pushes Mrs. Robinson aside,
     struggles with the door, gets the door open, runs into
     the hall and down the stairs.

39     INT. SUNROOM - NIGHT

     Ben rushes into the sunroom and sits down.  SOUND of
     FOOTSTEPS on the driveway outside.  Ben jumps up, gets
     the glass he had been drinking from and sits down again.
     SOUND of the front door OPENING and CLOSING.

          MR. ROBINSON'S VOICE
     Is that Ben's car in front?

          BEN
          (jumping up)
     Yes, sir!

     FOOTSTEPS approach the sunroom.  MR. ROBINSON enters.

          BEN
     I drove - I drove Mrs. Robinson
     home.  She wanted me to drive
     her home so I - I drove her home.

          MR. ROBINSON
     Swell.  I appreciate it.

          BEN
     She's upstairs.  She wanted me
     to wait down here till you got
     home.

          MR. ROBINSON
     Standing guard over the old
     castle, are you?

          BEN
     Yes, sir.

     Mr. Robinson reaches for Ben's glass.

          MR. ROBINSON
     Here.  It looks like you need
     a refill.

          BEN
     Oh no.

          MR. ROBINSON
     What?

          BEN
     I've got to go.

          MR. ROBINSON
     Is anything wrong?  You look
     a little shaken up.

          BEN
     No.  No - I'm just - I'm just
     a little worried about my
     future.  I'm a little upset
     about my future.

     Mr. Robinson takes the glass from him.

          MR. ROBINSON
     Come on.  Let's have a nightcap
     together.

     Mr. Robinson turns his back to Ben to mix the drinks.
     Ben takes several deep breaths, straightens his tie
     and checks to see if his fly is okay.  Mr. Robinson
     turns and brings him the drink.

          BEN
     Thank you very much, sir.

          MR. ROBINSON
     Ben - how old are you now?

          BEN
     Twenty.  I'll be twenty-one
     next week.

          MR. ROBINSON
          (taking out a
          cigarette)
     That's a hell of a good age
     to be.

          BEN
     Thank you.

          MR. ROBINSON
     I wish I was that age again.
     Because, Ben -

          BEN
     Sir?

          MR. ROBINSON
     You'll never be young again.

          BEN
     I know.

          MR. ROBINSON
     Ben, can I say something to
     you?

          BEN
     What?

          MR. ROBINSON
     How long have we known each
     other now?

     Ben shakes his head.

          MR. ROBINSON
     How long have you and I known
     each other?  How long have
     your Dad and I been partners?

          BEN
     Quite a while.

          MR. ROBINSON
     I've watched you grow up, Ben.

          BEN
     Yes, sir.

          MR. ROBINSON
     In many ways I feel as though
     you were my own son.

          BEN
     Thank you.

          MR. ROBINSON
     So I hope you won't mind my
     giving you a friendly piece
     of advice.

          BEN
     I'd like to hear it.

          MR. ROBINSON
     Ben - I think - I think you
     ought to be taking it a little
     easier right now than you seem
     to.

     Ben nods.

          MR. ROBINSON
     Sow a few wild oats.  Take things
     as they come.  Have a good time
     with the girls and so forth.

     Mrs. Robinson enters the room.  She is now wearing the
     dress she wore earlier.  Ben starts to get up.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Don't get up.

     Ben sits.

          MR. ROBINSON
     I was just telling Ben here he
     ought to sow a few wild oats.
     Have a good time while he can.
     You think that's sound advice?

     Mrs. Robinson nods.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Yes, I do.

          BEN
     I've got to go.

     He stands.  Mr. Robinson stands up with him.

          MR. ROBINSON
     You have yourself a few flings
     this summer.  I bet you're
     quite a ladies' man.

          BEN
     Oh no.

          MR. ROBINSON
     What?  You look like the kind
     of guy that has to fight them
     off.
          (to Mrs. Robinson)
     Doesn't he look to you like
     the kind of guy who has to
     fight them off?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Yes, he does.

     They start out of the sunroom.

40     INT. ROBINSON HALL - NIGHT

          MR. ROBINSON
     Oh say - Elaine gets down from
     Berkeley on Saturday.

          BEN
     Oh yes.

          MR. ROBINSON
     Ben - I want you to give her a
     call.

          BEN
     I will.

          MR. ROBINSON
     Great.

     Mr. Robinson opens the front door and Ben goes out.

41     EXT. ROBINSON HOUSE - NIGHT

     SHOOTING OVER THE CAR toward the house.  Ben comes toward
     the car.  Mrs. Robinson appears in the doorway; the light
     behind her makes it difficult to see her face.
          MRS. ROBINSON
     Benjamin?

          BEN
     Yes.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Thank you for taking me home.

     Ben nods.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     I'll see you soon, I hope.

     Ben continues to walk toward us.

          MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
     Ladies and gentlemen - your
     attention, please - for this after-
     noon's feature attraction.

                              CUT TO:

42     EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

     The sun shines brightly.  Standing and sitting around
     the pool are Mr. and Mrs. Braddock, their friends MR.
     and MRS. ARNOLD, and the Arnold children, PETER and
     LOUISE, who are eight or nine.  Watching from across the
     fence on one side of the house: the young girl from next
     door and her boy friend.  Across the fence on the other
     side of the house: a quartet of adults, formally dressed
     as though for a cocktail party, holding drinks and watch-
     ing.  One of them holds a baby.  The Braddocks, the
     Arnolds and their children are dressed in California
     Contemporary Sport Style: the adults in styles infinitely
     too young for them, the children in styles infinitely too
     old for them.

     Mr. Braddock stands alone at the end of the pool near the
     house.  The others are grouped, more or less, at the other
     end.  Mr. Braddock is hamming it up.

          MR. BRADDOCK
     Hey, over there -- I mean you!
     Your attention please!

     Mr. Braddock has moved over by one of the windows of the
     house, the window into the kitchen.  He speaks quickly -
     in a fake sotto voce - towards the window.

          MR. BRADDOCK
     Are you ready in there, feature
     attraction?

          BEN'S VOICE
     Could I speak to you for a second,
     Dad?

     But Mr. Braddock has already moved away from the window
     and is readdressing his audience.

          MR. BRADDOCK
     - what was I saying?

          MRS. ARNOLD
     Feature attraction.

          MR. BRADDOCK
     Right.  Hey - I'm glad to see
     you're paying attention.  A
     feature attraction that will be
     one of the most astounding
     events ever to take place in
     this particular backyard.

     They all laugh and some applaud.

          MR. BRADDOCK
     Now I'm going to ask for a big
     round of applause to bring this
     boy out here - wait a minute -
     let me amend that - to bring
     this young man out here - because
     today he is twenty-one-years-
     old -

          MR. ARNOLD
          (his hands like
          a megaphone)
     Let's get on with the show!

          MR. BRADDOCK
     Just hang on a minute because
     I have a few words to say -

          MR. ARNOLD
     You always do.

     They laugh; Mrs. Arnold makes a face at Mr. Arnold as
     he grinningly acknowledges the reponse to his snappy
     comeback.

          BEN'S VOICE
     Dad - could we just talk about
     this for a second?

          MR. BRADDOCK
     Twenty-one-years-old, ladies
     and gentlemen; four of those
     years spent accomplishing some
     rather extraordinary things at
     one of our nation's leading
     seats of learning -

          MR. ARNOLD
     Bring him out!

          PETER AND LOUISE
     On with the show!  On with the
     show!

          MR. BRADDOCK
          (to the window)
     I can't hold them much longer,
     Ben.  You better get out here.

          BEN'S VOICE
     I'd like to discuss this.

          MR. BRADDOCK
          (to his audience)
     This boy - I'm sorry - this
     young man - is soon to continue
     his education as a Frank Halping-
     ham Award Scholar - but before
     he does -

     Mr. Braddock darts back to the window.

          MR. BRADDOCK
     - before he does -
          (to the window)
     You're disappointing them, Ben.
     You're disappointing them.

          BEN'S VOICE
     Dad - can you listen -

          MR. BRADDOCK
          (meaning it)
     I'll give you ten seconds.
          (back to the
          people)
     He is going to give us a
     practical demonstration of
     what I feel safe in saying is
     a pretty exciting birthday
     present - and it better work
     or I'm out over two hundred
     bucks - so let's hear it for -

     Mr. Braddock moves to the screen door and pushes it open.
     It slams against the wall inside.

          MR. BRADDOCK
     - Benjamin Braddock!

44     INT. BRADDOCK BREAKFAST KITCHEN - SHOT DOWN THE HALL - DAY

     At the back of the hall, inside the house, stands Ben,
     dressed in a full length skin diver's wet suit, flippers
     on his feet, the oxygen tank strapped to his back, the
     mask pushed up his forehead, the air hose dangling.
     He holds a spear gun in his hand.

     The people applaud.

45     EXT BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY
     SHOT - FROM BEN'S POV

     The people in the backyard.  His father stands just
     outside the screen door.

          MR. BRADDOCK
     Folks - this remarkable young
     man is going to perform for you
     some spectacular and amazing
     feats of daring in water that is
     over six feet deep -

     Ben's arms come into view and pull the mask down.

     We are now looking through the mask as we MOVE FORWARD
     down the hall.  Everything is slightly distorted through
     the glass.  Ben's hand comes up again with the breathing
     apparatus in it.

     SOUND: the rythmic PUMPING of air, obliterating the
     SOUND of the people around the pool who seem to be
     applauding and chattering noiselessly.

     We MOVE out of the door and toward the pool.  Mr. Braddock
     is running back and forth, clapping his hands and
     delivering his now soundless pitch.

     We MOVE DOWN the steps and into the shallow end of the
     pool.  Mr. Braddock is moving along the side of the pool,
     motioning toward us to come down to the deep end.  He
     joins Mr. Arnold at the far end of the pool.  They both
     begin to motion us toward them.

     We get to the deep end of the pool.  Mr. Braddock signals
     us with his hand to go under.  He kneels down by the edge
     of the pool and reaches out with his hand and pushes us
     under.  He has a big smile.

     We SURFACE again and PAN AROUND for a last look.  The
     figures, through the slightly distorted glass of the mask
     of Mrs. Arnold and Mrs. Braddock, watching and smiling;
     the neighbors on each side of the house, looking over their
     fences and laughing and pointing; Mr. Arnold nodding
     encouragement and talking; Mr. Braddock on his knees,
     smiling and trying to reach out far enough to push us
     under.  We GO UNDER and SINK to the bottom of the pool.

46     EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY
     OVERHEAD SHOT (HELICOPTER POV)

     Looking down on the pool, on Ben's black suited body at
     the bottom and the people standing around the pool, looking
     down into it.

     PULL UP AND UP AND UP

     Until there are thirty houses below us, with its owners,
     swimming, playing, eating, cooking, reading, dancing,
     sunbathing, constructing and gardening around thirty pools.
     SOUND of Ben's BREATHING APPARATUS, fading into the SOUND
     of the WIND.

     Hold for a few seconds, then:

     SOUND of a dime DROPPING into a pay phone and DIALING.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

47     INT. TAFT HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT - CLOSEUP - BEN

     In a phone booth.  The booth is in the entrance area of
     the hotel between the lobby and the driveway.  Ben holds
     the receiver to his ear.  SOUND of PHONE RINGING.

          MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
     Hello.

          BEN
     Mrs. Robinson - I don't quite
     know how to put this -

          MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
     Benjamin?

          BEN
     Look - I was thinking about that
     time after the party -

          MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
     Where are you?

          BEN
     - and I was wondering if I could
     buy you a drink or something -

          MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
     Where are you?

          BEN
     Uh - The Taft Hotel.

          MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
     Did you get a room?

          BEN
     No.  Now I know it's pretty
     late and if you'd rather -

          MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
     Give me an hour.

          BEN
     What?

          MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
     I'll be there in an hour.

     SOUND of her HANGING UP.  Ben hangs up slowly.
     He stands up in the booth, looks around, moves about
     uncomfortably for a few moments, removes his jacket and
     carrying it folded across his arm in front of him,
     leaves the phone booth and crosses to the doors that
     lead to the main lobby.  As he is about to go in, the
     doors open and a group of VERY OLD PEOPLE start coming
     out, filling the doorway and moving very slowly, muttering
     to each other and helping each other out of the door and
     down the steps.  Ben holds one of the doors open for them
     and stands politely to one side.  As they get through,
     Ben starts to move inside.  At that moment, A DOZEN YOUNG
     PEOPLE, dressed as though for a high school dance, push
     him to one side and move past him into the lobby.  He
     moves back against the other door, holding it open and
     allowing them to go in first.  He smiles politely and they
     pay no attention to him at all.  He follows them into the
     lobby.  They move toward the front desk and he moves with
     them.  One of the boys at the front of the group leans in
     and says something to the CLERK behind the desk.

     The clerk points across the lobby and says something to
     him.  There are the SOUNDS of an orchestra PLAYING some-
     where.  The group of young people passes by the desk
     and Ben moves in behind them.  He pauses at the desk and
     looks apprehensively at the hundreds of pigeon holes against
     the wall with the room numbers painted under them and the
     keys dangling suggestively.

          ROOM CLERK
     Can I help you, sir!

          BEN
     What?  Oh - no - I'm just -

     He points vaguely in the direction of the other young
     people.

          ROOM CLERK
     Are you here for an affair,
     sir?

     Terror and disbelief start in Ben's eyes.  He looks
     helplessly at the clerk.

          BEN
     What?

          ROOM CLERK
     The Singleman party, sir?

          BEN
     Oh - yes.  The Singleman party.

          ROOM CLERK
     It's in the main ballroom.

          BEN
     Ahh - thank you.

     Ben backs off and turns and starts across the lobby.
     He puts on his jacket as he goes.  He gets to the entrance
     to the main ballroom.  He pauses at the door, looks in.

     What he sees:  People dancing, talking, sitting, etc.
     He turns back toward te lobby.  He stops.

     What he sees:  The room clerk scross the lobby watching
     him.

     Ben flashes a huge smile and points in toward the ballroom
     as though to express his joy at finding the Singleman
     affair inside, then turns back and enters the ballroom.

48     INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

     As Ben steps inside.

          VOICE
     Hello.

     Ben turns.  Four people stand in a row.  Official greeters,
     they are:  A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, AN OLDER MAN, AN ELDERLY
     LADY AND A TWELVE-YEAR-OLD BOY, dressed formally and they
     are smiling with great determination.

          BEN
     Hello.

     It is the older lady who has said hello.

          MRS. SINGLEMAN
     You must be one of the Porters.

     She grasps Ben's hand and shakes it.

          BEN
     No - actually I'm not -

          MRS. SINGLEMAN
     I'd like you to know my sister,
     Miss DeWitte -

     MISS DEWITTE, who, from the looks of things, always has
     been and always will be, Miss DeWitte, takes Ben's hand.

          MISS DeWITTE
     How do you do?

          BEN
     How do you do, Miss DeWitte?

          MRS. SINGLEMAN
     - and my husband, Mr. Singleman -

     Ben finds himself shaking the twelve-year-old boy's
     hand.

          BEN
          (apologetically)
     Oh - sorry -

          JEFFREY SINGLEMAN
     Fine, thank you.

          MRS. SINGLEMAN
     That's Jeffrey, of course.

     Ben switches to Mr. Singleman's hand.

          BEN
     Of course.

          MR. SINGLEMAN
     I didn't get your name, sir.

          BEN
     Benjamin Braddock, sir.

     Mrs. Singleman looks at the seating list she has been
     holding.

          MRS. SINGLEMAN
     Braddock - Braddock?

          BEN
     Yes, but I'm afraid -

          MRS. SINGLEMAN
     I'll find your table in a moment.
     Braddock.  Not Braniff?  We have
     a Braniff.

          BEN
     No - actually I'm just looking
     for a friend.

          MRS. SINGLEMAN
     I'm afraid I don't understand.

          BEN
          (backing off)
     I'm not with your party - I'm
     sorry.

          MRS. SINGLEMAN
     Hey - I don't get it.

     Ben is backing out.

          MISS DeWITTE
     I've enjoyed meeting you, Mr.
     Braniff.

          MRS. SINGLEMAN
     Angela - please!

     Ben backs out of the ballroom.

49     INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

     Ben crosses the lobby, passing PEOPLE going in and out of
     the hotel.  He stops at the entrance of the Veranda Room:

50     INT. VERANDA ROOM - NIGHT

     This is a large room with a bar and many tables along the
     windows that look out over the hotel grounds.  It is quite
     dark and cool inside and there are no more than a dozen
     people seated around.

     The CAMERA STAYS at the door as Ben walks into the room
     and crosses to the far end where he sits down at the table
     by the window.

     PUSH IN toward Ben as he sits there.  MUZAK is playing.

                              CUT TO:

51     ANGLE ON BEN

     sitting smoking.

                              CUT TO:

52     NEW ANGLE ON BEN

     sitting.

                              CUT TO:

53     NEW ANGLE ON BEN

     sitting drinking.

                              CUT TO:

54     ANGLE ON BEN

     In the door to the lobby in the b.g. is Mrs. Robinson.
     She pauses, looks into the room, sees Ben and starts
     toward him.  Ben is looking out the window.  He does
     not see her approach.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Hello, Benjamin.

          BEN
     Oh.  Hello.  Hello.

     He rises quickly.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     May I sit down?

          BEN
     Of course.

     He pulls out a chair, for her.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Thank you.

     They sit down.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     How are you?

          BEN
     Very well.  Thank you.

     Ben tries to smile then looks out the window, then down
     at the center of the table.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     May I have a drink?

          BEN
     A drink?  Of course.

     Ben looks toward a passing WAITER and raises his hand.
     The waiter pays no attention.  Ben looks back at Mrs.
     Robinson apologetically.

          BEN
     He didn't see me.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Waiter!

     For a moment, the noise in the room seems to recede.  The
     waiter stops in his tracks, turns toward them.  The waiter
     moves to their table.  The noise in the room comes back.
     The waiter looks at Mrs. Robinson.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     I will have a martini.

          WAITER No. 1
     Yes, madam.

     The waiter moves away.  Ben watches him go.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     You don't have to be so nervous,
     you know.

          BEN
     Nervous.  Well, I am a bit
     nervous.  I mean it's - it's
     pretty hard to be suave when
     you're -

     He shakes his head.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Did you get us a room?

          BEN
     What?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Have you gotten us a room yet?

          BEN
     I haven't.  No.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Do you want to?

          BEN
     Well - I don't.  I mean I could.
     Or we could just talk.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Do you want me to get it?

          BEN
     You?  Oh no.  No.  I'll get it.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Do you want to get it now?

          BEN
     Now?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Yes.

          BEN
     Well - I don't know.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Why don't you get it.

          BEN
     Why don't I get it?  Well -
     I will then.
          (he stands up)
     If you'll excuse me.

     Ben walks out of the Veranda Room and into the lobby.

55     INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

     Ben walks to the front desk and stands there.

          ROOM CLERK
     Yes sir?

          BEN
     A room.  I'd like a room,
     please.

          ROOM CLERK
     A single room or a double
     room?

          BEN
     A single.  Just for myself,
     please.

          ROOM CLERK
     Will you sign the register,
     please?

     He pushes the card and a pen toward Ben.  Ben writes his
     name on the card and then stares at it for a moment,
     crumples it up and fills out a second card.

          ROOM CLERK
     Is anything wrong, sir?

          BEN
     What?  No.  Nothing.

          ROOM CLERK
          (taking a key from
          behind the counter)
     Do you have any luggage, Mister --
          (looks at registration
          card)
     Gladstone?

          BEN
     Luggage?  Yes.  Yes.  I do.

          ROOM CLERK
     Where is it?

          BEN
     What?

          ROOM CLERK
     Where is your luggage?

          BEN
     Well it's in the car.  It's
     out in the car.

          ROOM CLERK
     Very good, sir.  I'll have a
     porter bring it in.

          BEN
     Oh no.

          ROOM CLERK
     Sir?

          BEN
     I mean I'd - I'd rather not
     go to the trouble of bringing
     it all in.  I just have a
     toothbrush.  I can get it my-
     self.  If that's all right.

          ROOM CLERK
     Of course.

     Ben reaches for the key.

          ROOM CLERK
     I'll have a porter show you the
     room.

          BEN
     Oh.  Well actually, I'd just as
     soon find it myself.  I just have
     the toothbrush to carry up and
     I think I can manage it myself.

          ROOM CLERK
     Whatever you say, sir.

     He hands Ben the key.

          BEN
     Thank you.

56     INT. VERANDA ROOM - NIGHT

     Mrs. Robinson sits, patiently and calmly.  Her face betrays
     absolutely nothing as she stares ahead of her and sips
     her martini.

          WAITER No. 1
     Mrs. Robinson.

     She looks up.  A waiter is standing next to the table
     with a telephone.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Yes?

     The waiter plugs the phone into the wall socket next to
     the table and hands her the receiver.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Thank you.

     The waiter nods and leaves.

          MRS. ROBINSON
          (into phone)
     Hello.

          BEN'S VOICE
     Mrs. Robinson?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Yes?

          BEN'S VOICE
     It's Benjamin.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Yes?

          BEN'S VOICE
     Benjamin Braddock.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Benjamin -- where are you?

          BEN'S VOICE
     Can you look through the glass.

     Mrs. Robinson turns in her chair and looks through the
     glass into the lobby.

57     INT. LOBBY - PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT - WHAT SHE SEES

     Ben is in the phone booth in the lobby no more than twenty
     feet away.

          BEN'S VOICE
     Can you see me now?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Yes, I can.

58     INT. LOBBY PHONE BOOTH

     Over Ben's shoulder, we can see his face reflected in the
     glass door and, through it, Mrs. Robinson sitting in
     the Veranda Room.

     INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION

          BEN
     I got a single room.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     That's fine.

          BEN
     But there's one thing.  The desk clerk
     seemed to be a little bit suspicious.
     I mean - I don't know what their policy
     is - but -

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Well - do you want to go up first?

          BEN
     Yes - I think that would be good.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     I'll be up in five minutes.

          BEN
     Well - goodbye then -

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Benjamin.

          BEN
     Yes?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Isn't there something you want to
     tell me?

          BEN
     To tell you?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Yes.

          BEN
     Well - I want you to know how much
     I appreciate this - really -

          MRS. ROBINSON
     The number.

          BEN
     What?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     The room number, Benjamin.  I think
     you ought to tell me that.

          BEN
     Oh?  You're absolutely right.  Absolutely.
     It's 512.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Thank you.

          BEN
     You're welcome.  Well - I'll see you
     later, Mrs. Robinson.

     He hangs up.

59     INT. LOBBY - PHONE BOOTH - SHOT - BEN

     He leaves the hpone booth and walks back into the main lobby.

60     INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

     As he passes the desk, on his way to the elevator, he starts
     to pat his breast pocket.

          BEN
     I've got it.

     The desk clerk looks up.

          BEN
     I say I've got it.

          CLERK
     Sir?

          BEN
     The toothbrush.  I got it all right.

          CLERK
     Very good, sir.

          BEN
     Yes.  Well - goodnight.

          CLERK
     Goodnight, sir.

     Ben walks out of shot.

60A     INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

     Ben leaves elevator, walks down corridor to hotel room and
     opens door.

61     INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     Ben closes the door behind him and leans with his back against
     it for a few moments looking at the room.  The only light
     is that coming in the window.  Ben turns on the light switch
     on the wall near the door.  The room blazes with the light
     from three lamps and an overhead fixture.  He turns the switch
     off.  He crosses to the bathroom.  Ben steps in and turns on
     the light.

61     INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     Ben steps out, moves to the window.  We see the pool area
     through the window.  Ben closes the blinds.

61Cont.There is a KNOCK on the door.  Ben crosses to the door and
     opens it.  Mrs. Robinson moves to the bureau and puts her
     purse and gloves on it.  She looks at herself in the
     mirror for a moment then turns slowly, looking at the room,
     finally ending on Ben's face.  She steps toward him.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Well?

     He clears his throat and then he kisses her.

          BEN
     Well.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Benjamin.

          BEN
     Yes?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     I'll get undressed now.  Is that all
     right?

          BEN
     Sure.  Shall I - I mean shall I just
     stand here?  I mean - I don't know
     what you want me to do.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Why don't you watch?

          BEN
     Oh - sure.  Thank you.

     She takes off her jacket.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Will you bring me a hanger?

          BEN
     What?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     A hanger.

     Ben opens the closet door.

          BEN
     Oh - yes.  Wood?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     What?

          BEN
     Wood or wire?  They have both.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Either one will be fine.

          BEN
     Okay.

     He brings her a hanger.  She puts her jacket on it.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Will you help me with this,
     please?

     She turns her back.

          BEN
     Certainly.

     He undoes the zipper at her neck.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Thank you.

          BEN
     You're welcome.

     She turns and looks at him.  He backs away.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Would this be easier for you
     in the dark?

          BEN
     Mrs. Robinson - I can't do
     this.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     You what?

          BEN
     This is all terribly wrong.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Benjamin - do you find me undesirable?

          BEN
     Oh no, Mrs. Robinson.  I think -
     I think you're the most attractive
     of all my parents' friends.
     I just don't think we could
     possibly --

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Are you afraid of me?

          BEN
     No - but look - maybe we could
     do something else together,
     Mrs. Robinson - would you like
     to go to a movie.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Benjamin, is this your first time?

          BEN
     Is this - what?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     It is, isn't it?  It is your
     first time.

          BEN
     That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson.
     That's really a laugh.  Ha ha.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     You can admit that, can't you?

          BEN
     Are you kidding?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     It's nothing to be ashamed of -

          BEN
     Wait a minute!

          MRS. ROBINSON
     On your first time -

          BEN
     Who said it was my first time.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     That you're afraid -

          BEN
     Wait a minute.

          MRS. ROBINSON
      - of bring - inadequate -  I mean
     just because you happen to be
     inadequate in one way -

          BEN
     INADEQUATE!

     LONG pause.

          MRS. ROBINSON
          (starting to dress)

          BEN
     Don't move.

     He slams the bathroom door shut.  The light in the room
     disappears.

     FADE IN

62     EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

     The midsummer sun beats down on the Braddock swimming pool
     and on Ben who lies on a rubber raft in the middle of the
     pool.  Ben wears dark glasses, is deeply tanned, and holds
     a beer can in one hand.

     SOUNDS:  teenagers YELLING and swimming in nearby pools;
     a radio PLAYING rock and roll; a television set TUNED to
     a ball game.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

63     CLOSER SHOT - BEN

     drifting.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

65     CLOSE SHOT - BEN

     SOUND of the back door CLOSING.  Ben opens his eyes and
     moves his head slightly.

66     WHAT HE SEES

     Mr. Braddock is passionately stoking a barbeque fire.  Mrs.
     Braddock is going toward him from the house, carrying some
     ominously large thing wrapped in tinfoil.

67     SHOT - BEN

     He rolls off the raft and swims to the end of the pool.  He
     climbs out, walks to the back door, takes his shirt from a
     chair and starts to put it on as he opens the back door and
     goes through.

68     INT. SPECIAL SET - TAFT HOTEL ROOM

     Ben has just shut the door to the bathroom behind him.  He
     is wearing his shirt, buttoned, and no trousers.

     PAN WITH BEN as he walks across the room past Mrs. Robinson
     who is standing in front of the bureau taking off her brace-
     let and watch.  He moves to a chair and sits.

     He picks up a cigarette from an ashtray on a table next
     to the chair.  Mrs. Robinson moves in to Ben, kneels in
     front of him and starts to unbutton his shirt.

     He takes the cigarette out of his mouth.

69     INT. SPECIAL SET - BRADDOCK DEN AND DINING ROOM - NIGHT
     SHOT - NEW ANGLE

     We now see behind Ben the door that leads from the Braddock
     den, in which Ben is sitting.  In the dining room, Mr.
     and Mrs. Braddock are sitting, having their dinner, looking
     through the doorways toward Ben.  Ben stands, crosses back
     to the door to the den and shuts it.

70     INT. BRADDOCK DEN - NIGHT - REVERSE

     On Ben's back as he returns to the chair and sits.  A
     television set, facing the chair, is on.  Ben picks up a
     can of beer and drinks from it.  An animated cartoon is
     playing on the television set.  Ben watches it.

71     REVERSE

     Ben's face, watching.  PUSH IN to CLOSEUP of his face.

72     REVERSE

     CLOSEUP of television set and cartoon.

75     INT. TAFT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     CLOSEUP Ben watching.  PULL BACK and we are in the Taft
     Hotel Room.  Ben is sitting on the bed, leaning against
     the headboard, watching the television set which is on a
     stand facing the bed.

     SOUND of the HUM of the test pattern.

     PULL BACK to a WIDE SHOT of the room, lit only by the light
     from the television set.  Mrs. Robinson walks into the shot,
     half dressed.  She passes between Ben and the television
     set and goes out of frame.  Ben continues to stare at the set.

     SOUND of a ZIPPER being pulled up.

     Mrs. Robinson appears again and passes the other way.

     SOUND of BRACELETS being put on.

     Mrs. Robinson passes back the other way again.

     SOUND of CLOTHING being put on and a PURSE being snapped
     closed.  Mrs. Robinson, now fully dressed and carrying
     her purse, passes through again and, without looking at
     Ben, goes to the door of the hotel room, opens it and
     exits.

76     INT. BENS' ROOM - CLOSEUP - BEN - DAY

     SOUND of DOOR closing.  Follow Ben as he gets up and moves
     to the windows of what is now his BEDROOM in the Braddock
     house.  He opens the closed blinds over the window.  The
     sun is bright outside.  His bathing suit is on the window
     sill.  He takes the suit and puts it on.  He moves to
     the bedroom door, opens it and goes out.

77     OMITTED

78     EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

     We see Mrs. Braddock in the kitchen.  Ben comes through
     the back door, moves to the pool and dives in.  The raft
     floats in the center of the pool.

79     SHOT - UNDERWATER

     Ben swims toward us the length of the pool.

80     SHOT - AT THE WATERLINE

     Ben surfaces and, in one movememt, pulls himself up on
     the raft and -

                              CUT TO:

81     INT. TAFT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     - lands on top of Mrs. Robinson on the bed.  He stays
     on top of her for a moment.

          MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
     Ben - what are you doing?

     Ben turns toward us and looks.

     Mr. Braddock standing by the side of the pool.  The
     sun is behind him.

          BEN'S VOICE
     Well - I would say that I'm
     just drifting.

                              CUT TO:

83     SHOT - BEN ON RAFT

          BEN
     - here - in the pool.

          MR. BRADDOCK
     Why?

          BEN
     Well - it's very comfortable -
     just to drift here.

          MR. BRADDOCK
     Have you thought about graduate
     school?

          BEN
     No.

          MR. BRADDOCK
     Would you  mind telling me then -
     what were those four years of
     college for?  What was the point
     of all that hard work?

          BEN
     You got me.

          MR. BRADDOCK
          (trying unsuccessfully
          to control himself)
     Now listen, Ben.  I think it's
     a very good thing that a young
     man - after he's done some very
     good work - should have a chance
     to relax and enjoy himself, and
     lie around, and drink beer and
     so on.  But after a few weeks
     I believe that person would
     want to take some stock in him-
     self and his situation and start
     to think about getting off his
     ass.

     Mrs. Braddock steps in beside Mr. Braddock.

          MRS. BRADDOCK
     The Robinson's are here.

     Mr. Robinson steps in beside the others.  They blot out
     the sun.

          MR. ROBINSON
     Hi, Ben.  What are you doing with
     yourself these days?

          BEN
     Oh - not too much.  Taking it
     easy.

          MR. ROBINSON
     That's what I'd do if I could.
     Nothing wrong with that.  Hey
     Ben, Elaine's coming down from
     Berkeley soon.  I want you to
     call her up this time.

          BEN
     I will.

          MR. ROBINSON
     Because I just think you two
     would hit it off real well
     together.

     Mrs. Robinson steps in beside them.  (A long pause)

          MRS. BRADDOCK
     Say hello to Mrs. Robinson,
     Benjamin.

84     SHOT - BEN

          BEN
     Hello, Mrs. Robinson.

     Hello, Benjamin.

85     INT. BEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Ben, halfway dressed to go out, in slacks, shirt and tie,
     sits in a chair.  The door opens and Mrs. Braddock enters.

          MRS. BRADDOCK
     Can I talk to you a minute?

          BEN
     Sure.

          MRS. BRADDOCK
     Benjamin?  I'm going to ask you
     something but you don't have to
     tell me if you don't want.

          BEN
     What?

          MRS. BRADDOCK
     Well I'm going to ask you what
     you do when you go off at night.

          BEN
     When I go off?

          MRS. BRADDOCK
     You don't have to tell me if
     you don't want.

          BEN
     No, I do.  I want to tell you.

     There is a pause.

          BEN
     I drive around.

          MRS. BRADDOCK
     What else?

          BEN
     Nothing else.

          MRS. BRADDOCK
     Well you don't drive around from
     midnight until noon the next
     day, Benjamin.

          BEN
     Oh, no.

          MRS. BRADDOCK
     Then what do you do?  Do you
     meet someone?

          BEN
     Meet someone?

     She nods.

          BEN
     Why did you say that?

          MRS. BRADDOCK
     Well this is your business,
     Benjamin.
          (she starts toward
          the door)
     If you -

          BEN
     No wait.  Wait.

     She stops.

          BEN
     I don't meet anyone, mother, but
     why did you say that?

          MRS. BRADDOCK
     Benjamin, I'm not going to pry
     into your affairs, but I'd
     rather you didn't say anything
     at all than be dishonest.
     Goodnight, Benjamin.

          BEN
     Well, wait.

     She looks at him.

          BEN
     You think I'm being dishonest?

     She nods.

          BEN
     Well why do you - why do you
     think that?

          MRS. BRADDOCK
     Because I know you don't drive
     around for twelve hours.

          BEN
     Oh.  Well, I don't.  Shall I
     tell you what I do?

          MRS. BRADDOCK
     Not if you don't want to.

          BEN
     I do.

          MRS. BRADDOCK
     But I don't want you to make
     up something.

          BEN
     I'm not.  But I'm - I'm not very
     proud of what I do.  I usually
     get kind of drunk.  I usually
     drive over to Los Angeles and
     go to some bars and get kind of
     drunk.  Then I take a hotel
     room.  So I won't have to drive
     home on the freeway.  I mean it
     kind of scares me to drive home
     after -

          MRS. BRADDOCK
     Goodnight, Benjamin.

          BEN
     You believe me, don't you?

          MRS. BRADDOCK
     No.

          BEN
     You don't?

     She shakes her head.

          BEN
     But I want you to.  Please. Please
     will you believe me.

91     INT. TAFT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT - SHOT - BEN

     Mrs. Robinson's hands are undoing his necktie.  Ben is
     dressed as in previous scene, plus a jacket.

          BEN
     Wait a minute.
          (he pushes her
          hand away)
     Sit down a minute.

     Mrs. Robinson looks at him and raises her eyebrows.

          BEN
     Will you please sit down a
     minute.

     Mrs. Robinson walks to the bed and sits.  She reaches
     down to take off a shoe.

          BEN
     Will you leave that shoe on for
     a minute.  Please.

     She straightens up.

          BEN
     Now - do you think we could say
     a few words to each other first
     this time?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     If you want.

          BEN
     Good.  I mean are we dead or
     something?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Well I just don't think we have
     much to say to each other.

          BEN
     All we ever do is come up here
     and throw off the clothes and
     leap into bed together.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Are you tired of it?

          BEN
     I'm not.  No.  But do you think
     we could liven it up with a
     few words now and then?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Well what do you want to talk
     about?

          BEN
     Anything.  Anything at all.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Do you want to tell me about
     some of your college experiences?

          BEN
     Oh my God.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Well?

          BEN
     Mrs. Robinson.  If that's the best
     we can do let's just get the god-
     damn clothes off and --

     She reaches for her shoe.

          BEN
     Leave it on!  Now we are going to
     do this thing.  We are going to
     have a conversation.  Think of
     another topic.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     How about art.

          BEN
     Art.  That's a good subject.
     You start it off.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     You start it off.  I don't know
     anything about it.

          BEN
     Oh.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Don't you?

          BEN
     Yes I do.  I know quite a bit
     about it.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Go ahead then.

          BEN
     Art.  Well what do you want to
     know about it.

     She shrugs.

          BEN
     Are you interested more in modern
     art or more in classical art.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Neither.

          BEN
     You're not interested in art?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     No.

          BEN
     Then why do you want to talk
     about it?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     I don't.

     Ben nods and looks at the rug.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Can I take off my clothes now?

          BEN
     No.  Think of another topic.
     Tell me what you did today.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Do you really want me to?

          BEN
     Yes I do.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     I got up.

     Ben starts shaking his head.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Do you want to hear it or not?

          BEN
     Yes.  But you might try and spice
     it up with a little originality.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     I got up.  I ate breakfast and
     went shopping.  During the after-
     noon I read a novel.

          BEN
     What one.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     What?

          BEN
     What novel did you read.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     I don't remember.

     Ben nods.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Then I fixed supper for my husband
     and waited until -

          BEN
     There!

          MRS. ROBINSON
     What?

          BEN
     Your husband!  Mrs. Robinson!
     There's something we could have
     a conversation about.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Him?

          BEN
     I mean everything.  I don't know
     anything about how you - how you
     work this.  I don't know how you
     get out of the house at night.  I
     don't know the risk involved.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     There isn't any.

          BEN
     There's no risk?

     She shakes her head.

          BEN
     How do you get out of the house?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     I walk out.

          BEN
     You walk right out the door.

     She nods.

          BEN
     What do you say to him?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     He's asleep.

          BEN
     Always?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Benjamin, this isn't a very
     interesting topic.

          BEN
     Please.  Now tell me.  How do
     you know he won't wake up
     sometime and follow you.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Because he takes sleeping pills.
     He takes three sleeping pills
     every night at ten o'clock.

          BEN
     But what about the noise from
     the car.  What if -

          MRS. ROBINSON
     The driveway's on my side of
     the house.

          BEN
          (smiling)
     We're talking.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     What?

          BEN
     We're talking, Mrs. Robinson.
     We're talking.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Calm down, Benjamin.

          BEN
     Now let's keep going here.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Can I undress and talk at the
     same time?

          BEN
     Right.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Thank you.

          BEN
     Now.  You say the driveway's on
     your side of the house.  So I
     guess you don't sleep in the
     same room.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     We don't.

          BEN
     So you don't - I mean I don't
     like to seem like I'm prying
     but I guess you don't sleep
     together or anything.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     No we don't.

          BEN
     Well how long has this been going
     on.

          MRS. ROBINSON
          (looking at the
          ceiling for a moment)
     About five years.

          BEN
     Oh no.  Are you kidding me?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     No.

          BEN
     You have not slept with your
     husband for five years?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Now and then.  He geats drunk a
     few times a year.

          BEN
     How many times a year.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     On New Year's Eve.  Sometimes on
     his birthday.

          BEN
     Man, is this interesting.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Is it?

          BEN
     So you don't love him.  You
     wouldn't say you -

          MRS. ROBINSON
     We've talked enough, Benjamin.

          BEN
     Wait a minute.  So you wouldn't
     say you loved him.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Not exactly.

          BEN
     But you don't hate him.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     No, Benjamin.  I don't hate him.
     Unhook my blouse.

          BEN
          (unhooking her blouse)
     Well how do you feel about him,
     then?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     I don't.

          BEN
     Well that's kind of a bad
     situation then, isn't it?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Is it?

          BEN
     I mean it doesn't sound like it
     could be much worse.  If you
     hated him at least you'd hate
     him.

     She nods and takes off her blouse.

          BEN
     Well you loved him once, I
     assume.  When you first knew
     him.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     No.

          BEN
     What?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     I never did, Benjamin.  Now
     let's -

          BEN
     Well, wait a minute.  You married
     him.

     She nods.

          BEN
     Why did you do that?

          MRS. ROBINSON
          (taking off her
          stockings)
     See if you can guess.

          BEN
     Well I can't.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Think real hard, Benjamin.

          BEN
     I can't see why you did, unless
     ...you didn't have to marry him
     or anything, did you?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Don't tell Elaine.

          BEN
     Oh no.  You had to marry him
     because you got pregnant?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Are you shocked?

          BEN
     Well I never thought of you and
     Mr. Robinson as the kind of
     people who...

          MRS. ROBINSON
     All right.  Now let's get to bed.

          BEN
     Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
     So how did it happen?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     What?

          BEN
     I mean do you feel like telling
     me what were the circumstances?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Not particularly.

          BEN
     Was he a law student at the time?

     She nods.

          BEN
     And you were a student also.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Yes.

          BEN
     At college.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Yes.

          BEN
     What was your major?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Why are you asking me all this?

          BEN
     Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson.
     Now what was your major subject
     at college?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Art.

          BEN
     Art?

     She nods.

          BEN
     But I thought you - I guess you
     kind of lost interest in it over
     the years then.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Kind of.

          BEN
     Well how did it happen?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     How do you think.

          BEN
     I mean did he take you up to
     his room with him?  Did you go
     to a hotel?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Benjamin, what does it possibly
     matter?

          BEN
     I'm curious.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     We'd go to his car.

          BEN
     Oh no.  In the car you did it?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     I don't think we were the first.

     Ben thinks for a moment.

          BEN
     What kind of car was it?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     What?

          BEN
     Do you remember the make of the
     car?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Oh my God.

          BEN
     Really.  I want to know.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     It was a Ford, Benjamin.

          BEN
          (jumping up)
     A Ford!  A Ford!  Goddamnit, a
     Ford!  That's great!

          MRS. ROBINSON
     That's enough.

          BEN
     So old Elaine Robinson got started
     in a Ford.

     There is a pause.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Don't talk about Elaine.

          BEN
     Don't talk about Elaine?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     No.

          BEN
     Why not?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Because I don't want you to.

     She walks to the bed.

          BEN
     Well why don't you?

     She pulls the bedspread down.  Ben begins to remove his
     jacket.

          BEN
     I wish you'd tell me.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     There's nothing to tell.

          BEN
     Well why is she a big taboo
     subject all of a sudden?

     Mrs. Robinson uncovers one of the pillows.

          BEN
     Well - I guess I'll have to ask
     her out on a date and find out
     what's --

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Benjamin, don't you ever take
     that girl out.

     Ben looks at her.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Do you understand that?

          BEN
     Well look.  I have no intention
     of taking her out.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Good.

          BEN
     I was just kidding around.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Good.

          BEN
     But why shouldn't I?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     I have my reasons.

          BEN
     Then let's hear them.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     No.

          BEN
     Let's hear your reasons, Mrs.
     Robinson.  Because I think I
     know what they are.

     She pulls the covers down.

          BEN
     I'm not good enough for her to
     associate with, am I?  I'm not
     good enough to even talk about
     her, am I?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Let's drop it.

          BEN
     We're not dropping it.  Now
     that's the reason, isn't it?
     I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't
     I?  I'm not fit to -

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Benjamin?

          BEN
     I'm good enough for you but I'm
     too slimy to associate with
     your daughter.  That's it, isn't
     it?  ISN'T IT?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Yes.

          BEN
     You go to hell.  You go straight
     to hell, Mrs. Robinson.  Do you
     think I'm proud of myself?  Do
     you think I'm proud of this?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     I wouldn't know.

          BEN
     Well, I'm not.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     You're not.

          BEN
     No sir.  I am not proud that I
     spend my time with a broken-
     down alcoholic!

          MRS. ROBINSON
     I see.

          BEN
     And if you think I come here
     for any reason besides pure
     boredom, then you're all wrong.

     She nods.

          BEN
     Because - Mrs. Robinson this
     is the sickest, most perverted
     thing that ever happened to
     me.  And you do what you want
     but I'm getting the hell out.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Are you?

          BEN
     You're goddamn right I am.

     He starts putting on his shirt.  She sits on the edge of
     the bed and watches him.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     That's how you feel about me.

     He nods.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     That I'm a sick and disgusting
     person.

          BEN
     Now don't start this.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     What?

          BEN
     Don't start acting hurt.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Don't you expect me to be a
     little hurt?

          BEN
     Mrs. Robinson, you stand there
     and tell me I'm not good enough
     for your daughter.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Did I say that?

          BEN
     Of course you did.

     She shakes her head.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Benjamin, I want to apologize
     to you if that's the impression
     you got.

          BEN
     Well two minutes ago you told
     me I wasn't good enough for
     your daughter.  Now you say
     you're sorry I got that
     impression.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     I didn't mean it.  I don't think
     you'd be right for each other.
     But I would never say you
     weren't as good a person as
     she is.

          BEN
     You wouldn't.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Of course I wouldn't.

     Mrs. Robinson walks to the closet.

          BEN
     What are you doing?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Well it's pretty obvious you
     don't want me around any more.

          BEN
     Well look - I was kind of upset
     there.  I'm sorry I said those
     things.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     If that's how you feel -

          BEN
     But it's not.

          MRS. ROBINSON
          (smiling at him)
     That's all right.  I think I
     can understand why I'm disgusting
     to you.

          BEN
     Oh no.  Look - I like you.  I
     wouldn't keep coming here if
     I didn't like you.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     But if it's sickening for you -

          BEN
     It's not!  I enjoy it!  I look
     forward to it.  It's the one
     thing I have to look forward
     to.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     You don't have to say that.

          BEN
     Well I wouldn't.  I would never
     say it if it wasn't true.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     May I stay then?

          BEN
     Yes. Please.  I want you to.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Thank you.

          BEN
     Well don't thank me, because I
     want you to.

     There is a long pause.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     But you won't ever take out
     Elaine, will you?  I want you
     to promise me that.

     There is another long pause.

          BEN
     Look.  Why the hell did you
     bring this up.  It never
     occured to me to take her out.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Then give me your word you won't.

          BEN
     This is absurd.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Promise me, Benjamin.

          BEN
     All right, for christ's sake.
     I promise I will never take
     out Elaine Robinson.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Thank you.
          (pause)
     Benjamin -

          BEN
     Let's not talk about it.  Let's
     not talk at all.

     At opposite sides of the room, without looking at each
     other, they begin to take off their clothes.

                              FADE OUT

     FADE IN

92     INT. BRADDOCK KITCHEN - DAY

     Ben sits at the table, eating his breakfast and looking
     at the back of a cereal box.  Mr. and Mrs. Braddock
     are there.

          MR. BRADDOCK
     Elaine's back from school.  I
     think it might be a nice gesture
     if you asked her out.

     Benjamin looks at his father for a moment, then continues
     eating and reading.

                              CUT TO:

93     INT. BEN'S ROOM - DAY

     Ben is lying on his bed.  Mrs. Braddock stands in the
     doorway.

          MRS. BRADDOCK
     Don't you think that she's a
     terribly attractive girl?
     Because I think she's one of
     the prettiest girls I've
     ever seen.

     Ben gives a small whimper.

                              CUT TO:

94     EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

     Ben is lying face down on his raft in the middle of the
     Braddock pool.  The sun shines down.  His diving mask
     is on over his eyes.  His face is in the water, looking
     down at the bottom of the pool.  Mr. and Mrs. Braddock,
     in their bathing suits, are in the pool, paddling around
     Ben.  During the entire conversation they continue to
     swim around and around the raft, trying to talk and keep
     their heads above the surface.

          MRS. BRADDOCK
     It's pretty embarrassing.  I
     really don't know what to tell
     Mr. Robinson.  It's ackward
     and strained for me every time
     he suggests that you call up
     Elaine.

          BEN
     Next time he suggests it,
     I'll tell him I have no
     intention of ever calling
     her up in my life.

          MR. BRADDOCK
     I guess she's not good enough
     for you, is that it?

          BEN
     Look - Elaine Robinson and I
     do not get along.

          MR. BRADDOCK
     How do you know?  You haven't
     seen her since high school.  I
     guess your evenings, whatever
     you do with them, are just too
     valuable.

          BEN
     That has nothing to do with it -

          MR. BRADDOCK
     I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson
     that you're just too busy every
     evening - doing God knows what -

          MRS. BRADDOCK
     Don't go on like this.  Now if
     Benjamin absolutely refuses to
     take her out -

          BEN
     I do.

          MRS. BRADDOCK
     - then I'll simply invite all the
     Robinsons' over for dinner on
     Thursday.

95     SHOT - BEN

     He slides off the raft and goes underwater.

96     SHOT - BEN UNDERWATER

     His hair streaming up, his eyes open.

                              CUT TO:

97     INT. SPECIAL SET BRADDOCK DINING ROOM - NIGHT

     The dining room is one tenth its normal size.  At a
     table for two are seated, jammed in against each other,
     the three Robinsons and the three Braddocks.  Elaine's
     back is to us.  Ben is at the other end of the table,
     facing us.  The Robinsons and Braddocks sit along
     the sides.  Mrs. Robinson is next to Ben, everyone is
     eating, looking down at their places.  After a few moments
     Ben throws his head back ans starts to scream.  As he
     continues to scream, everyone looks at him except Mrs.
     Robinson who continues to eat calmly without looking up.

                              CUT TO:

98     EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

     Ben surfaces and pulls himself up on the side of the
     pool.

          BEN
     I'll go call Elaine now.

     Mr. and Mrs. Braddock cling exhausted to the raft and
     try to smile at each other.

     SOUND:  Ding dong of the Robinson door chimes.

                              CUT TO:

99     EXT. & INT. ROBINSON FRONT DOOR, HALL AND SUNROOM - NIGHT

     The door opens.  Mr. Robinson stands there with a huge
     smile.

          MR. ROBINSON
     Well, Braddock - it's about
     time you got around to this.
     Come on in.  I'm afraid the
     young lady isn't quite ready
     yet -

     Mr. Robinson turns toward the sunroom.  Mrs. Robinson is
     sitting there.

          BEN
     Hello.

          MR. ROBINSON
     What would you say to a short one?
     Bourbon still your drink?

          BEN
     Yes.

     Mr. Robinson hands him drink.

          MR. ROBINSON
     I'll see if she's ready.

     Mr. Robinson exits.

100     SHOT - BEN AND MRS. ROBINSON

          NOTE  Following dialogue played simultaneously

          BEN          MR. ROBINSON'S VOICE
     Now listen -- this was not        (from hall)
     my idea.  It was my father's     Hey -- there she is.  Miss
     idea.               America -- that's who it is.
                              It's definitely Miss America.
          MRS. ROBINSON
     Benjamin -- I thought I made     ELAINE'S VOICE
     myself perfectly clear about     Daddy - can you fix this?
     this.               The clasp is broken I think.

          BEN          MR. ROBINSON'S VOICE
          (whispering urgently)     I'll do it - I'll do it.
     Look, we'll go out to dinner
     and have a drink and I'll          ELAINE'S VOICE
     bring her back.  Because it     Is Ben here?
     was either that or a dinner
     party for the two families.          MR. ROBINSON'S VOICE
     And I'm afriad I couldn't     He's in the living room having
     quite handle that, if you     a chat with your mother.
     don't mind.  I have no
     intention of ever taking your
     precious daughter out again
     in her life.  So don't get
     upset about it.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     But I am.  I'm extremely upset
     about it, Benjamin.

     Mr. Robinson and ELAINE enter.

          ELAINE
     Hello.

          BEN
     Hello.

101     CLOSEUP - MRS. ROBINSON

          MR. ROBINSON'S VOICE
     Well - I want you to keep your
     wits about you tonight.  You never
     know what tricks Ben picked up
     back there in the East.

                              LAP DISSOLVE TO:

102     EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT

     SHOT - BEN AND ELAINE in Ben's car.  From the back.  Ben
     leans forward slightly, pushing the car recklessly in
     and out of the traffic.  Ben is wearing dark glasses.

          ELAINE
     You're living at home now.  Is
     that right?

          BEN
     Yes.

          ELAINE
     Do you know what you're going
     to do?

          BEN
     No.

          ELAINE
     Are you going to graduate school?

          BEN
     No.

     He leans on the HORN.  The car directly ahead of him
     does not move to the right.  Ben jerks his car over to the
     right, swerves around the car ahead, jamming his horn
     down, and swerves back into the outside lane, giving the
     driver of the other car an angry look as he passes him.
     Elaine holds on to the dashboard to keep her balance.

          ELAINE
     Do you always drive like this?

          BEN
     Yes.

                              CUT TO:

103     INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

     A drab, almost deserted room with formally dressed WAITERS.
     Ben and Elaine are seated at a table.

          BEN
     Do you want some dinner?

          ELAINE
     I'd love some.

     A waiter moves forward toward them.

          BEN
     Bring a menu.

          WAITER #2
     Dinner for two, sir?

          BEN
     No.  Just for her.

     The waiter moves away.

          ELAINE
     Aren't you eating?

          BEN
     No.

          ELAINE
     Why not?

          BEN
     If it's all right with you,
     I'm not hungry.

     The waiter returns with a menu.

          ELAINE
     I've changed my mind.  Thank
     you.

                              CUT TO:

104     EXT. SUNSET STRIP - NIGHT - SHOTS

     Ben and Elaine walking on the strip.

105     EXT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

     Ben pushes through the people crowded in around the
     entrance.  Without turning around, he waits for Elaine
     who has difficulty following him.  As she gets to him,
     he starts forward again.  He starts up the stairs.
     Elaine is just behind him.

                              CUT TO:

106     INT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

     Seedy, ugly, three quarters filled.  A tuxedoed HOOD leads
     them through the tables to a table directly under the stage
     on which a STRIPPER is in the process of removing her
     dress.  There is one chair facing the stage, the other with
     its back to and up against the stage.  Ben sits down in
     the chair facing the stage.  Elaine stands for a moment,
     unsure.

          BEN
     Sit down.

     Elaine sits in the chair with her back to the stage.
     She folds her hands on the table and looks down at them.
     Ben takes a pair of dark glasses out of his pocket and
     puts them on.  The two chairs are slightly angled toward
     each other so that Ben can look up at the stage without
     looking directly at Elaine.

          BEN
     Why don't you watch the show?

     The stripper is reflected in Ben's glasses.

          ELAINE
     Benjamin - do you dislike me
     for some reason?

          BEN
     No - why should I?

          ELAINE
     I don't know.

107     SHOT - ACROSS BEN - THE STRIPPER

     She is down to a tasseled bra and g-string.  She is
     twirling the tassels.

          BEN
     You're missing a great effect
     here.

     Elaine turns around, looks at the stripper and turns
     back.

          BEN
     How do you like that?

     Elaine doesn't answer.

          BEN
     Could you do it?

          ELAINE
     No.

     The stripper sees Elaine look.  The stripper smiles toward
     Ben and walks toward his table, twirling the tassels as she
     walks.  Ben smiles as he watches her approaching.

     The stripper moves directly behind Elaine's chair.  The
     spotlight from the back of the house falls into Elaine's
     face.  As it does, Elaine puts her hand up to shield
     her eyes.

     The stripper slides a finger into her mouth, wets it
     and holds it up in the air.  The music stops and a
     DRUM ROLL starts.  The stripper bends over Elaine's head
     and begins swinging the tassels so that they rotate in
     front of Elaine's face.

108     SHOT - BEN

     He leans forward slightly to watch the action.  The
     swinging tassels are reflected in his glasses.

     The DRUM ROLL gets louder and faster.  The tassels
     swing more frantically.

109     SHOT - ELAINE

     She pulls her hand down from in front of her eyes.

110     SHOT - BEN

     With Elaine's face reflected in his glasses.

111     SHOT - ELAINE

     Through Ben's glasses.  Elaine's face seen darkly but
     fully for the first time.  The tassels swing in front
     of it.  Tears start out of her eyes.

112     SHOT - BEN

     He reaches up to remove the glasses.

113     SHOT - ELAINE

     As the glasses come off and her face is seen in the harsh
     spill from the spotlight.  The tears are running down
     her face.  Only her eyes are crying as she looks straight
     at Ben.

114     SHOT - BEN

     With his glasses off, he watches her.  He reaches forward
     and puts his hand in the way of the tassels.

          STRIPPER
     Hey!

     Some of the customers start to boo.  Ben rises, takes
     Elaine's arm and leads her toward the exit.

                              CUT TO:

115     EXT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

     The entrance to the strip joint.  Elaine runs to the
     bottom of the steps.  The Sunset Strip sidewalk outside
     is crowded with people moving back and forth.  Ben follows
     her.  She pushes through the crowd on the sidewalk.  Ben
     catches her and holds her arm.

          BEN
     Elaine - I'm sorry.

     Elaine leans against the side of the building and pulls
     her arm away.

          ELAINE
     Will you take me home now?

          BEN
     I'm sorry I took you in there.

          ELAINE
     I think I'd better go home now
     please.

          BEN
     But, Elaine -

          ELAINE
     Where is the car?

          BEN
     I just want to tell you something.

     Ben, facing her, keeps moving from side to side, trying
     to get her to look at him.  She keeps looking away.

          ELAINE
     I want to go home.

          BEN
     But could I just tell you this
     one thing?

          ELAINE
     What?

          BEN
     This whole idea - this date
     and everything.  It was my
     parents' idea.  They forced me
     into it.

          ELAINE
     Oh - that's very nice of
     you to tell me.

          BEN
     No.  What I mean is - that's
     why I've been acting this way.
     I'm not like this.  I hate
     myself like this.

     She starts to cry.  People on the sidewalk are looking at
     them.  She turns away from them.  Ben moves away from
     them.  Ben moves around in front of her.

          BEN
     Listen - could you stop crying,
     please?

          ELAINE
     No, I couldn't.

          BEN
     But could you try?

          ELAINE
     No.

     She brings both hands up to her face.  Ben looks at her
     for a few moments in agony.  Then, very determined, he
     takes her wrists in his hands and pulls them away from
     her face.  She looks up startled.  She starts to give a
     little cry but before she can he is kissing her.  She closes
     her eyes.

     He brings his fists, containing her hands, up to the side
     of her face.  He opens his hands against her face, freeing
     her hands.  Her hands move slowly to his wrists and hang
     on.  After a while she pulls away, turning her head slightly
     to one side.

          BEN
     Elaine -

     He starts to pull her head back.

          ELAINE
     Not here.  Not here.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

116     EXT. DRIVE IN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

     Ben and Elaine are sitting in the car in a drive-in
     restaurant.  There are trays hooked onto windows along
     side of both of them.  They are eating and drinking
     furiously.

          BEN
     I've had this feeling - ever
     since I've graduated - this -
     kind of compulsion that I have
     to be rude all the time.  Do
     you know what I mean?

          ELAINE
     Yes, I do.

     He looks at her.

          BEN
     It's like I've been playing
     some kind of - game - but the
     rules don't make any sense to
     me -

     She is watching him carefully.

          BEN
     - they're being made up by all
     the wrong people - no - I mean
     no one makes them up, they seem
     to have made themselves up.

     A car with a COUPLE OF TEENAGERS has driven up in the
     slot on their right.  Its RADIO is tuned into a rock
     and roll station and it is playing LOUDLY.  Ben leans
     across Elaine and speaks through the window to the
     kid behind the wheel.

          BEN
     Say - I wonder if I could request
     you to turn that down a little?

     The kid turns the radio up.  Ben and Elaine roll their
     windows up.

117     SERIES OF SHOTS

     From outside of car.  Ben is talking with great animation
     - Elaine is watching him.  They are both eating as Ben
     talks, telling Elaine a story.  Their windows are rolled
     up.

     SOUNDS: Cars GUNNING their ENGINES; horns HONKING;
     radios PLAYING; waitresses YELLING orders; customers
     YELLING at waitresses; kids LAUGHING and TALKING from
     car to car; MOTORCYCLES driving in and out, TRAFFIC.

                              CUT TO:

118     EXT. ROBINSON HOUSE - NIGHT

     The car coasts silently to a stop in front of the Robinson
     house.  The RADIO plays QUIETLY.  Ben turns it OFF.  They
     sit there for a long time without saying anything, Ben's
     hand touching her shoulder.  It is very quiet.

          ELAINE
     Well - maybe I'd better go in.

     He nods.  They continue to sit there for another long
     moment.

          ELAINE
     Would you like to come in?  I
     could make some coffee.

          BEN
     No, I mean - I wouldn't want to
     wake anyone up.

          ELAINE
     We won't.  Let's go inside.

          BEN
     Wait a minute.

          ELAINE
     Is anything wrong?

          BEN
     No - I was just thinking -
     look - it's still early -
     we could do something - go
     somewhere else.

          ELAINE
     All right.

     He starts the car immediately and drives away from the
     house.

119     INT. BEN'S CAR - NIGHT

     Ben is driving.

          ELAINE
     Where we going?

          BEN
     I'm trying to think of where
     there's a place to have a
     drink around here.

          ELAINE
     Isn't there one in the Taft
     Hotel?

     There is a SQUEAL of TIRES as Ben almost drives off
     the road.

          ELAINE
     What is the matter?

          BEN
     Nothing.  I'm just wondering if
     they have a bar or not.  I mean
     let's go see.  Let's go see if
     they do or not.

120     INT. TAFT HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

     Ben and Elaine enter the lobby and stand just inside
     the door.  They start in a few steps.

          BEN
     Listen, Elaine - it seems to me
     that there isn't a bar in here.
     I mean - as far as I know.

          ELAINE
     Of course there is.  Look -
     The Veranda Room - right there.

     ONE of the CAR PARKERS passes them on his way out.

          CAR PARKER
     Good evening.

     CAMERS BEGINS TO PULL UP AND AWAY.  A BELLBOY passes
     them.

          BELLBOY
     Hello, how are you, sir?

     The room clerk smiles at them.

          ROOM CLERK
     Good evening, Mr. Gladstone.

     Ben and Elaine stop a few feet into the center of the
     lobby.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK to a HIGH OVERHEAD SHOT
     revealing many people moving back and forth in the
     lobby, passing Ben and Elaine.

          VOICE #1
     Hello again.

          VOICE #2
     Hi, Mr. Gladstone.  How are you
     this evening?

          ELAINE
     Benjamin -

          BEN
     Let's get out of here, Elaine.
     Let's go somewhere else.

          ELAINE
     Benjamin - do they know you?

          BEN
     Of course not.

          VOICE #3
     Good evening, sir.

          VOICE #4
     Mr. Gladstone - how are you?

     He moves her toward the door.

          BEN
     Come on, Elaine.  We're leaving.

                              CUT TO:

121     EXT. TAFT HOTEL

     Ben brings Elaine through the door to the porch.

          ELAINE
     Ben - what's happening?  Who
     is Mr. Gladstone?

          BEN
     I don't know.  They must think
     I look like this guy Gladstone.

     PAN WITH THEM as they start down the steps.  Coming up
     the steps toward them is Miss DeWitte, on the arm of
     another ELDERLY LADY.

          MISS DeWITTE
     Hello, Mr. Brannif.

     SOUND:  Car STARTING noisily.

122     EXT. TAFT HOTEL DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

     Ben and Elaine in his car.  He takes his hand off
     the ignition, jams on the accelerator and drives the car
     speedily for twenty-one feet and jams on the brakes.  He
     turns off the ignition and the lights.  He puts his
     head down on the steering wheel.  He lifts his head.

          BEN
     Elaine - I like you.  I like you
     so much.  Do you believe that?

     She nods.

          BEN
     Do you?

          ELAINE
     Yes.

          BEN
     You're the first - you're the
     first thing for so long that
     I've liked.  The first person
     I could stand to be with.

     She takes his hand.

          BEN
     I mean my whole life is such a
     waste.  It's just nothing.  I'm
     sorry.  I'll take you home now.

     He turns the key in the ignition and starts the car.

          ELAINE
     Benjamin - are having an
     affair with someone?

     He freezes with his hand still on the key.

          ELAINE
     I'm sorry.

     He turns off the engine.

          ELAINE
     I'm sorry.  That is not my
     business.

          BEN
     It just happened.  It was just
     this thing that happened along
     with everything else.  Can you
     understand that?

     She nods.

          ELAINE
     Was she married or something?

          BEN
     Yes.

          ELAINE
     With a family?

          BEN
     Yes.  She had a husband and a
     son.

          ELAINE
     Did they ever find out?

          BEN
     No.

          ELAINE
     And it's all over now.

          BEN
     Yes.

          ELAINE
     I'm glad.

     He starts the car and drives out.

123     EXT. ROBINSON HOUSE - NIGHT - SHOT - BEN AND ELAINE IN
     BEN'S CAR

          BEN
     Can we do something tomorrow?

          ELAINE
     All right.

          BEN
     During the day?  We'll go for
     a drive or something.

          ELAINE
     Okay.

          BEN
     You sure you really want to?

          ELAINE
     Yes.

          BEN
     Because I wouldn't want you to
     do it unless you really wanted
     to!

          ELAINE
     I do.

          BEN
     You do?

          ELAINE
     Benjamin - I really do.

124     EXT. STREET NO. 1 - NEAR ROBINSON HOUSE - DAY
     SHOT - INT. BEN'S CAR - BEN DRIVING

     It is raining.  On the seat beside Ben is a package.
     From the way it is wrapped, we can tell it is a gift.
     Ben's right hand is on it as he drives.  The radio is
     playing.  Past Ben and through the windsheild as the
     Robinson house comes closer and closer.  The front door
     of the Robinson house opens and Mrs. Robinson comes out,
     dressed in a housecoat, and, in four or five fast steps,
     reaches the car, opens the door on the passengers side
     and climbs in.  Ben moves the package over into his lap.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Drive down the block.

          BEN
     Mrs. Robinson - I have a date
     with Elaine.  We're going for
     a drive.

          MRS. ROBINSON
          (looking at him
          for the first time)
     Do exactly what I say.

     Ben starts the car forward down the driveway.

125     ANOTHER ANGLE - BEN AND MRS. ROBINSON

     As they drive.

          BEN
     Now it seems to me -

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Listen to me very carefully,
     Benjamin.  You are not to see
     Elaine again.  Ever.  Those
     are my orders.  Is that clear?

     Ben stops the car in front of a house halfway down
     the block.

          BEN
     Mrs. Robinson -

          MRS. ROBINSON
     I can makes things quite unpleasant.

          BEN
     How?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     In order to keep Elaine away
     from you - I am prepared to
     tell her everything.

          BEN
     I don't believe you.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Then you'd better start believing me.

          BEN
     Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it.  I'm
     asking you please not to wreck it.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Go home now.

          BEN
     I just don't believe you would do that.

     Mrs. Robinson looks at him for a moment.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Try me.

     There is a pause while Ben looks at her expression.  Then
     he grabs the keys out of the ignition, opens the door on
     his side and jumps out of the car, carrying the package.

     TRACK WITH BEN as he runs up the street and up the drive-
     way toward the Robinson house.  Ben gets to the front
     door.

          BEN
          (as he goes through
          the door)
     Elaine!

126     INT. ROBINSON HALLS, STAIRS, DOOR TO ELAINE'S ROOM - DAY

     Ben runs in.

          BEN
     Elaine?

          ELAINE'S VOICE
     Benjamin?

          BEN
     I'm coming up.

          ELAINE'S VOICE
     I'm not dressed yet.

     Ben runs up the stairs.  He still carries the package.
     Ben gets to the top just as Elaine comes out of the door
     to her bedroom.  She is wearing a skirt and slip and
     carrying one shoe.

          ELAINE
     Benjamin - I said I wasn't dressed -

     Ben pushes her back into her room.

127     INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - DAY

          ELAINE
     What's the matter?

          BEN
     You've got to go over the back
     fence and I'll meet you on the
     corner.

          ELAINE
     Benjamin - what's happening?

          BEN
     Hurry up.  Put your shoes on.

     Ben turns and looks.

128     SHOT - OVER BEN'S SHOULDER

     Mrs. Robinson is just entering the house.

          BEN
     NO.

     He turns around.

129     NEW ANGLE

     Elaine is standing in the doorway watching him.  She
     still holds the shoe in her hand.

          BEN
     Why aren't you ready?

          ELAINE
     Because I want to know what's
     happening.

     SOUND of Mrs. Robinson's FOOTSTEPS in the hall below.

          BEN
     There isn't time!

130     INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - DAY

     Ben pulls Elaine around behind the open door.  They stand
     in the angle formed by the door and the wall as though
     they are hiding from someone.  Mrs. Robinson's FOOTSTEPS
     can be heard coming up the stairs.

          BEN
     Elaine - I have to tell you
     something.

     He holds her against the wall in the corner.

          ELAINE
     What is it?

          BEN
     That woman -

          ELAINE
     What?

          BEN
     That woman.  The older woman.

          ELAINE
     You mean the one who -

          BEN
     Yes.  The married woman - it
     wasn't just some woman -

     Mrs. Robinson's FOOTSTEPS can be heard coming down the
     hall.

     What are you telling me?

     The FOOTSTEPS stop.

131     ANGLE - CLOSE ON ELAINE

     Back in the corner.  Mrs. Robinson's face appears in the
     crack in the door at Elaine's shoulder.  Elaine looks from
     Ben's face to the crack through which she can see her
     mother's eyes staring.

          ELAINE
     Please - will somebody tell me -

     She looks back at Ben, then back at her mother's face again.
     Mrs. Robinson's eyes watch her through the crack in the
     door.  Elaine looks away.

          ELAINE
     Oh - no.

     Ben backs up.

          BEN
     Elaine -

          ELAINE
     Oh my God -

     Moving along the wall as though to keep as far from Ben
     as possible, Elaine moves away from the door.

          BEN
     Please.

     Elaine walks a few steps toward the other side of the room
     then turns back toward Ben.  The tears are starting out
     of her eyes.

          BEN
     No - don't cry -

          ELAINE
     GET OUT!

          BEN
     Don't cry.
          (holds the package
          out to her)

          ELAINE
     Get out of here.

     She moves toward him as though to hit him.  He backs into
     the hall.  Elaine SLAMS the door shut.

          ELAINE

     Get out!

     Goodbye, Benjamin.

     He looks at her in horror.  He starts to back down the
     hall toward the stairs, holding the package against
     his chest.

134     INT. SPECIAL SET - ROBINSON HALL - DAY - SHOT - PULLING
     BACK FROM MRS. ROBINSON

     very bad dream.

     Ben dressed differently, stands by the window overlooking
     the backyard.  Over his shoulder, we can see Mr. Braddock
     down by the pool, dressed in a sweater, cleaning the pool
     with a long-handled scoop.  Mr. Braddock looks up at Ben's
     window.  Ben moves aside.

138     EXT. ROBINSON HOUSE - DAY

     Ben is standing behind a tree watching the

     Elaine is getting into the Robinson car.  Mr. Robinson
     is putting Elaine's luggage into the car.  Mrs. Robinson
     stands at the door.  Mr. Robinson gets into the car and
     starts it.  The car drives down the driveway and down the
     street.

139     INT. BEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Ben, dressed differently again, sits in a chair by his
     desk.  He is writing.  On the piece of paper is written:
     DEAR ELAINE, ELAINE, ELAINE, ELAINE, and her name several
     dozen times.  He stops and looks up.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

140     INT. BRADDOCK KITCHEN - DAY

     It is early morning.  We see a swinging door pushed open
     to reveal:  Mr. Braddock, dressed in a bathrobe, standing
     at the kitchen counter by the window through which we can
     see an orange tree.  Mr. Braddock is pouring orange juice
     from a MINUTE MAID container.  Ben stands inside door.

          MR. BRADDOCK
     Say that again.

          BEN
     I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.

     MR. BRADDOCK STARTS TO SMILE.

          MR. BRADDOCK
     Well - well - well -

     He almost giggles as he crosses to Ben and takes his hand
     to shake it.  Mrs. Braddock appears in the doorway.  Ben
     is shaking his father's hand.

          MRS. BRADDOCK
     What's happening?

          MR. BRADDOCK
     Ben says he and Elaine are getting
     married.

          MRS. BRADDOCK
     I don't believe it.

          MR. BRADDOCK
     That what he says.  Right?

          BEN
     I'm going up to Berkeley today.

          MRS. BRADDOCK
     Oh, Ben - this is so - exciting -

          MR. BRADDOCK
     Come on, let's call the Robinsons.
     We've got something to celebrate.

          BEN
     No.  I think you'll want to wait
     on that.

          MRS. BRADDOCK
     They don't know?

          BEN
     No - they don't.

          MRS. BRADDOCK
     Well - when did you decide all
     this?

          BEN
     About an hour ago.

          MR. BRADDOCK
     Wait a minute.  You talked to
     Elaine this morning?

          BEN
     No.  She doesn't know about it.

          MR. BRADDOCK
     She doesn't know that you're
     coming up to Berkeley?

          BEN
     No.  Actually - she doesn't
     know about us getting married
     yet.

          MRS. BRADDOCK
     When did you two talk this over?

          BEN
     We haven't.

          MR. BRADDOCK
     Ben - this whole idea sounds
     pretty half-baked.

          BEN
     No - it's not.  It's completely
     baked.  It's a decision I've made.

          MRS. BRADDOCK
     But what makes you think she
     wants to marry you?

     Ben picks up his suitcase, walks to the door and turns.

          BEN
     She doesn't.  To be perfectly
     honest, she doesn't like me.

     Benjamin - you're - I don't
     know what to say - you're --

          BEN
     Maybe we could get together
     some time and talk about it.

          ELAINE
     - really incredible -

          BEN
     Here he comes.

          ELAINE
     What?

          BEN
     I've got a real feeling that
     this is the fellow.

     Elaine looks.  A good-looking young man is striding
     briskly toward them.  It is CARL SMITH.

          CARL
          (waving)
     Elaine!

          BEN
     He certainly is a good walker.

     Carl strides up to them.  He takes the pipe out of his
     mouth and puts it in his pocket.  He reaches out and
     takes Elaine's hands.

          CARL
     Am I late?  I'm sorry.

          BEN
     We thought you said by the
     monkey house.

     Carl frowns and looks up over Elaine's shoulder at Ben.
     Ben smiles.

          ELAINE
     This is Benjamin Braddock.
     Carl Smith.  Benjamin rode
     here with me on the bus.

          CARL
     Glad to meet you, Ben.

     Ben steps forward and grasps Carl's hand.

          BEN
     Great meeting you, Carl.

     Carl steps back and puts an arm around Elaine's shoulder.
     The three of them look at each other for a moment.

          BEN
     Swell seeing you.  Have a good
     time.

     Ben turns and starts walking back the way he came.  Carl
     and Elaine turn and go in the opposite direction.  Ben
     stops after a few steps and walks over to one of the
     cages.  He grips the rail with his hand and looks back
     at:

177     SHOT - CARL AND ELAINE

     Walking away, his arm over her shoulder, his other hand
     gesturing with the pipe in it as he talks.

178     SHOT - BEN

     As he watches them go.  His artificial smile disappears.
     The agony is such that he has to steady himself with
     his hand on the rail.  He turns his face away, toward the
     cage.  There is an animal in it, staring at Ben.  They
     look at each other.  There is a box - an automatic device
     with a recorded desciption of the animal - that begins
     to deliver its RECORDED MESSAGE.

     SHOT - THROUGH THE WINDOW

     Elaine is walking up the street toward the rooming house.

181     INT. ROOMING HOUSE - BEN'S ROOM - DAY - SHOT - BEN

     He jumps to the other side of the window and peers out
     carefully.

182     EXT. ROOMING HOUSE - STREET - DAY - SHOT - THROUGH THE
     WINDOW

     Elaine turns in and disappears into the rooming house
     front door below.

183     INT. ROOMING HOUSE - BEN'S ROOM AND HALLWAY - DAY - SHOT
     BEN

     He runs to the bed and puts the covers back into place.
     He goes to the window sill, picks up an empty beer can,
     crosses to the bureau, opens a bureau drawer.  He crosses
     to the wastepaper basket under the sink, bends down and
     takes a newspaper out of it.  He crosses to the chair and
     sits down.  He holds the newspaper in front of him.  It
     is hopelessly crumpled.  He gets up, crosses to the
     bureau, opens a drawer and takes out a traveling iron.
     He kneels down, puts the newspaper on the floor and tires
     to straighten it out with the iron.

     There is a KNOCK on the door.  He rises, puts the iron
     back in the drawer as quietly and quickly as he can,
     then back to the chair, sits down and holds the newspaper
     on his lap.

          BEN
     Come in.

     There is another KNOCK.  Ben crosses to the door and opens
     it.  Elaine is standing in the hall.

          ELAINE
     I want to ask you a question.

          BEN
     Come in.

          ELAINE
     No.  I want to know why you're
     here in Berkeley?

          BEN
     Because - I am.

          ELAINE
     Is it because I'm here?

          BEN
     What do you think?

          ELAINE
     I think it is.

     Ben nods.

          ELAINE
     I said I think it is.

          BEN
     All right then!  Yes!

          ELAINE
     Well, I want you to leave.

          BEN
     Elaine - I love you.

          ELAINE
          (looking down)
     How could you do that, Benjamin?

     Ben moves in behind her and puts his hand on her arm.

          ELAINE
     Do you just hate everything?
     How could you possibly rape
     my...

          BEN
     What?

          ELAINE
     I don't understand -

          BEN
     Did you say rape her?

          ELAINE
     - how you - how anyone - could
     do a thing like that.

          BEN
     What did she say?

          ELAINE
          (holding his arm)
     Let me go.

          BEN
     You've got to tell me what she
     said.

     He touches her hair.

          ELAINE
     Why?

          BEN
     Because it isn't true.

          ELAINE
     I don't feel well.

     Ben pushes her down softly onto the bed.  He kneels
     along side her.

          BEN
     Tell me.

     Ben sits next to her and puts his hand on her shoulder.

          ELAINE
     She said she was having a drink
     in the hotel with a friend.
     You waited for her in the parking
     lot and told her she was too
     drunk to drive home and that
     you would get her a room for
     the night.

          BEN
     Then what?

          ELAINE
     Then you took her upstairs and
     you raped her.

          BEN
     Elaine - that is not what happened.

     She puts her hands on his shoulder.

          ELAINE
     Please let me go.

          BEN
     All right - but listen to me.
     What happened was there was
     this party at my parents.  I
     drove your mother home - then
     we went upstairs to see your
     portrait -

     Elaine tightens her arms around his neck.

          ELAINE
     Don't tell me -

          BEN
     - and when we got up in the
     room she starts taking her her
     clothes off - and -

          ELAINE
     Benjamin - this is my mother!

          BEN
     - suddenly there she was without
     any clothes on - I mean really
     naked -

     Ben is almost lying on top of her.  Elaine screams - a
     long, loud scream.  Ben looks at her.  He leaps off
     the bed and runs to the sink.  He fills a glass with
     water and brings it to Elaine.  He starts toward the
     door.

     SOUND OF FOOTESTEPS on the stairway and in the hall.
     Ben goes to the closet, opens the door, takes a jacket
     from a hanger and puts it on.

     SOUND:  A KNOCK on the door.

          MR. McCLEERY'S VOICE
     What's going on in there?

     Elaine sits up and drinks the water.  Ben looks at
     her then goes to the door and opens it.

          BEN
     Oh - hello, Mr. McCleery.

          MR. McCLEERY
     Who screamed?

          BEN
     It's all right, Mr. McCleery.

          MR. McCLEERY
     Screaming isn't all right.  Not
     in my house it isn't.

          BEN
     It was just a visitor.  But it's
     all right now.

     Several BOYS are gathering in the hallway trying to see
     into the room.  Ben edges through the door into the
     hallway.

184     INT. ROOMING HOUSE HALLWAY - DAY

          MR. McCLEERY
     What did you do to her?

          BEN
     Look - she's all right.  She's
     upset and she screamed.  But
     she's okay now.

          A BOY
     Shall I get the cops?

          BEN
     What?

          A BOY
     I'll get the cops.

     He starts for the stairs.

          BEN
     Hey - wait a minute.  Now damn
     it - look.

     He opens the door a little way.  They all try to see in.

          BEN
     See - she's just having some
     water.  Now there's no need
     for the cops or anything.

          MR. McCLEERY
     All right, boys - I think you
     can get back to your rooms.  I
     don't think we'll have any more
     of this agitation.  Will we,
     Braddock?

          BEN
     No, sir.

     The boys start back to their rooms.  Mr. McCleery and Ben
     stand and look at each other for a few seconds.

          MR. McCLEERY
     I want you out of here.

     Mr. McCleery turns away and walks down the hall and starts
     down the stairs.

          BEN
     Mr. McCleery?

          MR. McCLEERY
     You heard me.  Out of here.

          BEN
     What for?

          MR. McCLEERY
          (going down the
          stairs)
     Because I don't like you.

     Mr. McCleery disappears down the stairs.  Ben turns and
     goes back into the room.

185     INT. ROOMING HOUSE - BEN'S ROOM - DAY

     Elaine is standing at the sink.  She is putting water on
     her face.  Ben goes to the closet and takes out his suit-
     case and carries it to the bed.

          ELAINE
     I'm sorry I screamed.

     Ben opens the suitcase.

          ELAINE
     Benjamin, when you came up here,
     what did you think was going to
     happen between us?

          BEN
     Elaine - right now I don't feel
     like talking much.  I'm sorry
     about everything but I think I'll
     just do this now.

     He stands, looking into the empty suitcase.

          ELAINE
     Can I just sit here while you're
     packing?

          BEN
     If you want.

     Elaine sits in the chair.  She watches him as he goes to
     the bureau, takes some shirts from a drawer and puts them
     in the suitcase, then goes back to the bureau.  He gets
     down on his knees and looks under the bureau.

          ELAINE
     What are you looking for?

          BEN
     My belt.

          ELAINE
     Don't you have it on?

          BEN
     No.  I have two.  The other one
     is the one I'm looking for.
          (he reaches under
          the bureau)
     What's this?
          (he brings out a
          marble)
     It's from my grandmother.

          ELAINE
     The marble?

          BEN
     The belt I'm looking for was
     from my grandmother.

          ELAINE
     Oh.

     Ben takes the marble to the suitcase and packs it.

          ELAINE
     What are you going to do now?

          BEN
     I don't know.

     He goes back to the bureau, gets some socks and underwear
     and carries them to the suitcase.

          ELAINE
     Are you going home?

          BEN
     No.

          ELAINE
     Well - where are you going?

     He goes back to the bureau, opens a drawer, takes out
     some T-shirts and the beer can and carries them to the
     suitcase.

          BEN
     Elaine - you're going to have to
     stop asking me that.

     He packs the T-shirts, then carries the beer can back to
     the bureau and puts it back in the drawer, takes some
     ties from the drawer and crosses to the suitcase.  Elaine
     gets up, goes to the door and opens it.

          ELAINE
     I don't want you to leave tomorrow.

          BEN
     I don't understand.

          ELAINE
     I don't want you to go anywhere
     until you have a definite plan.

          BEN
     But Elaine -

          ELAINE
     Goodbye.

     She walks out, shutting the door behind her.  He crosses
     to the window.

     Yes.

     No, Benjamin.

          BEN
     Well, what did he say?  I'm curious.

     He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.

     Oh no.  He said that.

     puts it in a box and gives it to him.  He pays for it and
     exits PAST CAMERA, WHISTLING.

196B     INT. ROOMING HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS - NIGHT

     Ben enters carrying four oddly shaped boxes and some flowers.

197     INT. ROOMING HOUSE STAIRS AND BEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Ben is whistling happily as he runs up the stairs two at a
     time.  He opens the door to his room and steps in.  The room
     is dark.  The figure of a MAN is silhouetted against the
     window.  Ben freezes just inside the door.  There is a long
     pause.

          MR. ROBINSON
          (clearing his throat)
     Do you want - do you want to try
     and tell me why you did it?

          BEN
     Mr. Robinson?

          MR. ROBINSON
     Do you have a special grudge
     against me?  Do you feel a particularly
     strong resentment for me?

          BEN
     No, it's not --

          MR. ROBINSON
     Is there something I've said that's
     caused this contempt?  Or is it just
     the things I stand for that you
     despise?

          BEN
     It was nothing to do with you, sir.

          MR. ROBINSON
     Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to
     do with me.

     Ben takes a step forward.

          BEN
     Now look - please -

          MR. ROBINSON
     Ben, I think we're two civilized
     human beings.  Do you think it's
     necessary to threaten each other?

          BEN
     I am not threatening you.

          MR. ROBINSON
     Do you want to unclench your fists,
     please?  Thank you.  I can see in
     the dark, you know.  I've been here
     quite a while.

          BEN
     I am trying to tell you I have no
     personal feelings about you, Mr.
     Robinson.  I am trying to tell
     you I do not resent you.

          MR. ROBINSON
     You don't respect me terribly
     much either, do you?

          BEN
     No, I don't.

          MR. ROBINSON
     Well, I don't think we have a
     whole lot to say to each other,
     Ben.  I do think you should know
     the consequences of what you've
     done.  I do think you should
     know that my wife and I are
     getting a divorce soon.

          BEN
     But why?

          MR. ROBINSON
     Why?

          BEN
     It shouldn't make any difference
     what happened.

          MR. ROBINSON
     That's quite a statement.

          BEN
     Listen to me.  We got - we got
     into bed with each other.  But
     it was nothing.  It was nothing
     at all.  We might - we might just
     as well have been shaking hands.

          MR. ROBINSON
     Shaking hands.  Well, that's not
     saying much for my wife, is it?

          BEN
     You miss the point.

          MR. ROBINSON
     Don't shout at me, Ben.

          BEN
     The point is - I don't love your
     wife.  I love your daughter, sir.

          MR. ROBINSON
     Well - I'm sure you think you do,
     Ben, but after a few times in
     bed with Elaine I feel quite sure
     you'd get over that as quickly
     as you -

          BEN
     HUH?

          MR. ROBINSON
     I think I've talked about this
     enough.  I don't know how far
     I can go, Ben.  I don't know if
     I can prosecute or not, but I
     think maybe I can.  In the light
     of what's happened I think maybe
     I can get you behind bars if you
     ever look at my daughter again.
     I have seen Elaine and I have
     spent the afternoon taking steps
     to insure...

     Mr. Robinson climbs across the bed to get to the door.
     Ben takes a step toward him.

          MR. ROBINSON
     Stay away from me, Ben!

     Mr. Robinson stands at the door.

          MR. ROBINSON
     I don't want to mince words with
     you.  As far as Elaine's concerned
     you're to get her out of your
     filthy mind right now.  Is that
     perfectly clear ro you?  That's
     all, Ben.  You'll pardon me if
     I don't shake hands with you.

     Mr. Robinson opens the door and starts into the hall.

          MR. ROBINSON
     I think you are filth.

     Mr. Robinson turns back from the hall.

          MR. ROBINSON
     I think you are scum.

     Mr. Robinson starts down the stairs.  Mr. McCleery is
     standing on the stairway, listening.

          MR. ROBINSON
     You are a degenerate!

     Mr. Robinson turns and goes down the stairs, past Mr.
     McCleery who looks up at Ben.

198     SHOT - BEN

     He walks to the door, looks out into the hall at Mr.
     McCleery, then shuts the door.  Ben goes to the window
     and looks out.

     Mr. McCleery - do you have
     some change?  I need to use
     the phone?

          MR. McCLEERY
     I want you out of here.

          BEN
          (takes out some
          money)
     Look - I'll give you ten dollars
     for a dime - I'll give you
     twenty - for God's sake, will
     you let me use that phone?

          MR. McCLEERY
     I am going to call the police now.

          BEN
     Could I make one phone call first?

          MR. McCLEERY
     Get out!

     Ben stuffs the money back in his pocket and runs down the
     stairs and out of the building.  Through the door we see
     him run down the street and out of sight.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Hello.  Get me the police, please.

          BEN
     Where is Elaine?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     I'll be with you in a moment,
     Benjamin.
          (into phone)
     Will you send a police car to twelve

     ask him.
          (to Ben)
     Are you armed?
          (into phone)
     No - I don't believe he is.  Thank
     you.

     She hangs up.

          BEN
     What have you done to her?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     I think we have everything quite
     under control now, Benjamin.  Would
     you like a quick drink before you go?

     She picks up a glass from the night table and takes a
     drink.

          BEN
     You can't stop me from seeing her,
     Mrs. Robinson.  I'll find her.

          MRS. ROBINSON

     you to the wedding, Benjamin, but
     the arrangements have been so rushed -

     He says something and Carl and Elaine kiss.

          BEN
     Oh, Jesus - God - no -

     He puts his hands up against the glass and slumps.  The

     Mr. Robinson, Carl, and Mrs. Robinson are moving toward
     Elaine.  The ORGAN is playing LOUDLY.  Ben's voice can
     be heard SHOUTING Elaine's name.  The POUNDING on the
     glass can be heard.

          CARL
     Who is that guy?  What's he doing?

          MR. ROBINSON

     Mr. Robinson is waiting for Ben, crouching, his arms spread.
     Behind him is Elaine.  Ben moves toward them.  Mr. Robinson
     grabs Ben around the waist.  Ben twists away.  Mr. Robinson
     grabs Ben's collar and tears his jacket half off.  Ben
     turns and hits Mr. Robinson in the face.  Mr. Robinson
     falls down.  Ben moves to Elaine and grabs her hand.  He
     pulls her toward the doors.

          BEN
     Out of my way!

     Carl steps in and grabs Ben from behind.  Ben breaks
     Carl's hold and picks up a gold cross off a nearby stand.
     He begins to swing it, advancing toward Carl.  Carl
     backs up toward the other guests.

274     NEW ANGLE

     Mrs. Robinson steps to Elaine.  She reaches out and takes
     Elaine's wrist.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Elaine - it's too late.

     Elaine pulls her hand away.

          ELAINE
     Not for me.

275     SHOT BEN

     He turns toward the man standing in front of the door and
     raises the cross over his head.

     and opens the door.  She and Ben go out.

     grabs Elaine's wrist.

     up and they continue to run.

277     INT. CHURCH VESTIBULE - DAY

     From inside the church vestibule.  Through the glass
     doors, we can see Elaine and Ben running down the street.
     The wedding party members are tugging furiously at the
     jammed doors.  Mrs. Robinson turns toward us and calmly
     begins to put on her gloves.

278     EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF CHURCH - DAY

     Ben and Elaine running along the sidewalk.  Ben holds

     flowers.  They run to a bus that is just closing its
     doors.

     He bangs on the closed door of the bus.  The door opens.
     Ben climbs the step into the bus and pulls Elaine up
     after him.  The doors close.

     Ben holds out a dollar bill.

          BEN
     How much?

          DRIVER
     Where do you want to go?

          BEN
     To the end.

     The driver takes the bill and gives Ben some change.
     Ben turns and pulls Elaine along to the back of the bus.
     He pushes her into one of the seats and sits beside
     her.  Ben looks toward the front of the bus.

     in their seats and looking back at them.

          BEN
     What?

     She takes his hand.

285     EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF CHURCH - DAY

     Through the window in the back of the bus the church can
     be seen receding in the distance.  There seem to be a
     number of men dressed in black running around in the
     street in front of it.

                              FADE OUT
