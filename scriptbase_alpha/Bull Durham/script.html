<i>       In baseball, you don't know nothing.

			 --Yogi Berra



       Whoever wants to know the heart and
       mind of America had better learn
       baseball.

			 --Jacques Barzun



       You could look it up.

			 --Casey Stengel
</i>
Titles over--

FADE IN:

A series of still photos.  Black and white.  Ancient.

BABE RUTH SWINGS -- An icon of American history.  His giant
upper body balanced delicately on tiny ankles and feet.  The
huge bat in an elegant followthrough...

						DISSOLVE TO:

TY COBB ROUNDS THIRD -- The most vicious ballplayer of them
all, a balletic whirling dervish.

						DISSOLVE TO:

JACKIE ROBINSON STEALS ROME -- Yogi Berra applies the tag.
Too late.

						DISSOLVE TO:

JOE DIMAGGIO WITH HIS SON in the Yankee clubhouse.  Walking
down the runway, Joe in uniform.  Number five.

PULLBACK REVEALS:

A WALL COVERED WITH BASEBALL PICTURES behind a small table
covered with objects and lit candles.  A baseball, an old
baseball card, a broken bat, a rosin bag, a jar of pine tar--
also a peacock feather, a silk shawl, a picture of Isadora
Duncan.  Clearly, the arrangement is--

A SHRINE -- And it glows with the candles like some religious
altar.

We hear a woman's voice in a North Carolina accent.

		ANNIE (V.O.)
	I believe in the Church of
	Baseball.
		(beat)
	I've tried all the major religions
	and most of the minor ones--I've
	worshipped Buddha, Allah, Brahma,
	Vishnu, Siva, trees, mushrooms,
	and Isadora Duncan...

PAN AWAY FROM THE SHRINE across the room.  Late afternoon
light spills into the room, across fine old furniture, to a
small dressing table.  A WOMAN applies make up.

ANNIE SAVOY, mid 30's, touches up her face.  Very pretty,
knowing, outwardly confident.  Words flow from her Southern
lips with ease, but her view of the world crosses Southern,
National and International borders.  She's cosmic.

		ANNIE (V.O.  CONT'D)
	I know things.  For instance--
		(beat)
	There are 108 beads in a Catholic
	rosary.  And--
		(beat)
	There are 108 stitches in a
	baseball.
		(beat)
	When I learned that, I gave Jesus
	a chance.
		(beat)
	But it just didn't work out between
	us   The Lord laid too much guilt
	on me.  I prefer metaphysics to
	theology.
		(beat)
	You see, there's no guilt in
	baseball...and it's never boring.

ANNIE OPENS A CLOSET DOOR -- Dozens of shoes hang from the
door.  She chooses a pair of RED HIGH HEELS, with thin straps.
She sits on a bench and

		ANNIE
	Which makes It like sex.
		(beat)
	There's never been a ballplayer
	slept with me who didn't have the
	best year of his career.
		(beat)
	Making love is like hitting a
	baseball--you just got to relax
	and concentrate.

ANNIE SLIPS ON THE RED HIGH HEELS -- Smoothing her hands up
her calves as she does.

		ANNIE
	Besides, I'd never sleep with a
	player hitting under .250 unless
	he had a lot of R.B.I.'s or was a
	great glove man up the middle.
		(beat)
	A woman's got to have standards.

SHE HOLDS OUR HER LEGS DISPLAYING THE HEELS, side by side.
Like a little girl showing off her new shoes.

		ANNIE
	The young players start off full
	of enthusiasm and energy but they
	don't realize that come July and
	August when the weather is hot
	it's hard to perform at your peak
	level.
		(beat)
	The veterans pace themselves
	better.  They finish stronger.
	They're great in September.
		(beat)
	While I don't believe a woman
	needs a man to be fulfilled, I do
	confess an interest in finding
	the ultimate guy--he'd have that
	youthful exuberance but the
	veteran's sense of timing...

ANNIE STARTS PACKING A HUGE HANDBAG -- With fruit, an official
scorebook, binoculars, a radar gun, and lipstick.

		ANNIE
	Y'see there's a certain amount of
	"life-wisdom" I give these boys.
		(beat)
	I can expand their minds.
	Sometimes when I've got a
	ballplayer alone I'll just read
	Emily Dickinson or Walt Whitman
	to him.  The guys are so sweet--
	they always stay and listen.
		(beat)
	Of course a guy will listen to
	anything if he thinks it's
	foreplay.

ANNIE TOUCHES PERFUME BEHIND HER EARS and, ever so slightly,
in her cleavage.

		ANNIE
	I make then feel confident.  They
	make me feel safe.  And pretty.

ANNIE POSES IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR -- She smoothes her dress
along her hips.  And puts on a flashy pair of sunglasses.
Stylish and slightly mad.

		ANNIE
	what I give them lasts a life-
	time.  What they give me lasts
	142 games.  Sometimes it seems
	like a bad trade
		(quickly rebounding)
	but bad trades are part of baseball--
	who can forget Frank Robinson or
	Milt Pappas, for Godsakes!
		(beat)
	It's a long season and you got to
	trust it.

ANNIE STARTS FOR THE DOOR and grabs her baseball glove

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  ANNIE'S HOUSE -- DUSK

A frame house with porch and lots of trees--a Thomas Wolfe
house...with a 1959 faded red Volvo in the driveway.

ANNIE LEAVES ON FOOT, turning onto the sidewalk of a bucolic,
old Durham, North Carolina neighborhood.  In the b.g.  other
people are heading the same direction ANNIE PULLS A DURHAM
BULLS BASEBALL CAP from her handbag and pulls it on her head.

		ANNIE
	I've tried them all--I really
	have--
		(beat)
	and the only church that truly
	feeds the soul--day in, day out--
	is the Church of Baseball.

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  THE CHURCH -- DURHAM BASEBALL PARK -- DUSK

Now visible In the late afternoon sun, a rickety old stadium
carved into the center of an old Tobacco town.

People are arriving on foot from all around...

"Rock Around the Clock" by Bill Haley fills the air.

CLOSE ON A BASEBALL CLOWN -- MAX PATKIN, 60, at home plate
doing his famous Bill Haley routine.- A comic pitcher's windup
full of twists and goofy choreography.

		RECORDING OVER P.A.
	One o'clock, two o'clock, three
	o'clock, rock...Four o'clock,
	five o'clock, six o'clock rock...

ANNIE SITS DOWN IN HER PRIVATE BOX SEAT -- Her chair is wiped
off by a young black boy, JACKSON, 11, who then sits next to
her.  He is her employed errand runner, note sender, and
friend.

A GROUP OF GROUPIES ENTERS THE PARK -- 20 year old girl/women,
dressed in tight pants, tight everything.

Friendly, eager, innocent--THEY WAVE TO ANNIE.

FIVE PLAYERS' WIVES AND THREE SMALL CHILDREN sit in a special
box seat behind a small sign "Players' Wives".

		RECORDING OVER P.A.
	Seven o'clock, eight o'clock,
	nine o'clock rock...we're gonna
	rock around the clock tonight

						     CUT TO:

EXT/INT.  THE DURHAM BULL DUGOUT -- NIGHT

AS MAX PATKIN CONTINUES HIS ROUTINE, PLAYERS WARM UP, AND-

THE MANAGER, JOE RIGGINS, 45, known merely as SKIP, short
for "Skipper", a chaw of tobacco in his cheek, stands with
his pitching coach, LARRY HOCKETT late 30's, an ex-big leaguer
whose body has seen too many cocktail lounges.

LARRY ROLLS SOME RED MAN CHEWING TOBACCO into a slab of pink
bubble gum, carefully folding the corners, tucking it neatly
together.  Larry examines it as they talk-And shoves the
giant chaw into his mouth.

		SKIP
	Where's Ebby?

		LARRY
	Ain't he warning up?

		SKIP
		(cynically)
	No.  The guy's professional debut
	and he forgets about it.

		LARRY
	Better find our bonus baby, eh?

A PLAYER, DEKE, 25, stuffs a hot dog into his mouth.

		SKIP
	Seen Ebby?

		DEKE
		(mouthful of food)
	Nope.

SKIP WHIRLS AND HEADS UP THE TUNNEL into the:

						     CUT TO:

INT.  THE DURHAM CLUBHOUSE -- NIGHT

SKIP enters, shouting--

		SKIP
	Ebby?!

CLOSE ON A BARE ASS -- Baseball uniform around the ankles,
short t-shirt on top, and on top of that the head of EBBY
CALVIN LALOOSH, baseball cap on backwards.  EBBY is a great
looking energetic man-child with the endless confidence,
naivete and horniness of youth.

Life is a party.

A YOUNG WOMAN, MILLIE, 20, half nude, is dressing quickly.

EBBY WHIRLS as Skip enters.

		SKIP
	Jesus.  Game starts in four
	minutes!
		(beat)
	Why ain't you warm?!

		EBBY
	I am warm.

		SKIP
	I'm fining you a hundred dollars.
	Jesus, Ebby, this is your
	professional debut tonight--you
	know how many guys out there'd
	give blood to be in your shoes
	an' you're leavin' your fastball
	in the locker room for some piece
	of ass!

MILLIE LOOKS OUT FROM BEHIND A BAT RACK -- Outraged.

		MILLIE
	Skip, It's me!  I'm not some quote
	piece of ass unquote.

		SKIP
	Oh, Millie, jeez, sorry--I didn't
	recognize ya.  Don't take it
	personal but if I catch you in
	here again you're banned from the
	ballpark.

		MILLIE
	You can't ban me from the ballpark
	'cause Daddy donated the scoreboard
	and if you banned me he might
	take the scoreboard away.

		SKIP
	Whatta we need a scoreboard for?
	We haven't scored any runs all
	year
		(tough, to Ebby)
	Get your ass out there.

As Skip starts to leave.

		EBBY)
	Hey Boss, I got a question.

		SKIP
		(stops, exasperated)
	What?!

		EBBY
	You think I need a nickname?  I
	think I need a nickname.  The
	great ones have nicknames--
	somethin' like Oil Can or Catfish

Skip stares at him.  He can't believe this guy.

		SKIP
	Ya got three minutes.

SKIP WHIRLS AND HEADS BACK OUT TO THE FIELD -- And Ebby
unperturbed, turns his attention back to Millie.

		EBBY
	Got time for another quickie?

		MILLIE
	Jesus, you got a game to pitch!

		EBBY
	But we got three minutes.

EXT.  THE BALLPARK -- MOMENTS LATER -- NIGHT

						     CUT TO:

MAX PATKIN STILL FLAILING AWAY to "Rock Around the Clock".

		RECORDING
	When the clock strikes two, three,
	and four and the band slows down
	we'll yell for more, gonna rock
	around the clock tonight.

ANNIE LOOKS THROUGH HER BINOCULARS -- Studying the players
warming up casually on the sidelines as Patkin winds up his
act.

P.O.V.  A LATIN PLAYER playing pepper.

		ANNIE
	Number twenty-two's thighs are
	just great.  Who's he?

		JACKSON
		(reading the program)
	Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at
	Lynchburg last year.

		ANNIE
	Three-fourteen?  Hmmm...  Look't
	those thighs, Jackson

BACK TO MAX PATKIN -- He finishes his routine.

		RECORDING OVER P.A.
	Gonna rock, gonna rock around the
	clock tonight.

INT.  PRESS BOX -- NIGHT

						     CUT TO:

A WOMAN ANNOUNCER, MARYLOU, 30, speaks into the P.A.  mike.

		ANNOUNCER
	Let's hear it for Max Patkin--

Applause as Patkin takes his bows, leaves the field, shakes
hands with a the BULL MASCOT LEADING THE APPLAUSE.

		ANNOUNCER
	"The Greatest Show on Dirt"--your
	own Durham Bulls!

						     CUT TO:

INT.  THE DUGOUT

CLOSE ON ANOTHER PLAYER -- MICKEY MCFEE, 23, black.  Smoking
a cigaret--always smoking a cigaret.  He snuffs out his
cigaret and RUNS onto the field with the rest of the team,
as--

EBBY ENTERS THE DUGOUT from the runway.  Larry and Skip
encourage their players running onto the field.  Ebby is
trying to get the zipper on his fly unstuck.  He smiles
broadly at Skip and Larry, and grabs his glove.

		EBBY
	I'm there, Skip, I'm ready.

						     CUT TO:

INT.  THE PRESS BOX

THE RADIO ANNOUNCER, TEDDY CULLINANE, 50, leans into the
radio mike of a very small local station.  Next to him is
the local SPORTSWRITER, WHITEY SHERRARD, 40.  Between them
they've seen a million minor league players come and go.

		WHITEY
	Is this guy LaLoosh worth a hundred
	grand?  I hear he's a quart low?

		TEDDY THE RADIO MAN
		(covering the mike)
	He's left handed.  Whattya expect?
		(on the air)
	The Bulls are off to a slow start
	having dropped their first three
	games, but hope to turn it around
	tonight with the professional
	debut of the heralded young left
	hander, Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
		(beat)
	Stepping In for the Peninsula
	White Sox is leadoff hitter Willie
	Foster

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  THE BALLFIELD -- NIGHT

ANGLE TO ANNIE'S BOX SEAT -- Millie has joined Annie and
Jackson.  Clearly, the younger women look up to Annie for
wisdom and insight.

		ANNIE
	--Millie, you've got to stay out
	of the clubhouse.  It'll just get
	everybody in trouble.

		MILLIE
	I got lured.

		ANNIE
	You didn't get "lured".  Women
	never get lured.  They're too
	strong and powerful for that.
	Now say it--"I didn't get lured
	and I will take responsibility
	for my actions".

		MILLIE
	"I didn't get lured and I will
	take responsibility for my
	actions".

		ANNIE
	That's better.
		(to Jackson)
	Got the radar ready?

		JACKSON
	Ready.

JACKSON AIMS A RADAR GUN at the plate.

THE PENINSULA WHITE SOX LEADOFF HITTER steps in.

		TEDDY THE RADIO MAN (V.O.)
	The word on LaLoosh is that the
	good looking young lefty has a
	major league fastball but sometimes
	has problems with his control

EBBY CALVIN LALOOSH WINDS UP and fires.  The pitch sails
over the batter's head, over the catcher's head, over the
backstop, and CRASHES INTO THE PRESS BOX.

						     CUT TO:

INT.  THE PRESS BOX

THE ANNOUNCER AND SPORTSWRITER CRASH to the floor as the
ball smashes into their booth.

						     CUT TO:

INT.  THE DUGOUT

SKIP SPITS TOBACCO, mumbles flatly to Larry.

		SKIP
	Little high.

		LARRY
		(shouts to EBBY)
	C'mon big 'un, you're okay...

ANNIE'S BOX SEAT -- She turns to Jackson.

		JACKSON
	Ninety-five miles an hour.

		ANNIE
	He looks great, just great!

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  THE PITCHER'S MOUND

THE CATCHER TALKS TO EBBY, trying to calm him down.

		CATCHER
	What the hell was that?!  Lighten
	up a little.  Awright?

		EBBY,
		(to catcher)
	Hey--what's your name again--I'm
	bad with names--

		CATCHER
	Ed.  You want me to write it on
	my chest?  Jesus ...

		EBBY
	Sorry.  Hey, Ed, I got a question.

		CATCHER
	What?

		EBBY
	Who's the beef sitting behind the
	third base dugout?

		CATCHER
		(slowly)
	That's Annie Savoy.  Nice eh?
	But that's more woman than you
	ever dreamed of, Rook.  She could
	kick your ass and have you for
	breakfast

THE CATCHER RETURNS to the plate.

INT.  THE PRESS BOX

						     CUT TO:

WHITEY AND TEDDY WARILY CLIMB back to their seats.

		TEDDY
	One ball and no strikes to Willie
	Foster...

						     CUT TO:

EBBY'S NEXT PITCH HITS FOSTER in the ribs.  He crumples.

						     CUT TO:

ANNIE'S BOX SEAT -- She's writing a note.  She hands it to
Jackson.

		ANNIE
	Take this to Ebby in the dugout
	between innings.

		JACKSON
	What's it say?

		ANNIE
	It says he's not bending his back
	on his follow-through.

JACKSON RUNS OFF with the note.  Annie turns to Millie.

		ANNIE
	Well let's get down to it, honey--
	how was he?

		MILLIE
	Well, he fucks like he pitches.
	Sorta all over the place

P.O.V.  EBBY LALOOSH FIRES ANOTHER ONE into the stands.  And--

Hit "Rock Around the Clock"--

				     DISSOLVE INTO:

QUICK MONTAGE OF EBBY'S FIRST GAME -- Strikeouts and wild
pitches.  A young, gifted, uncontrollable thrower.

		BILL HALEY AND HIS COMETS
	When the chimes ring five, six
	and seven--We'll be right in
	Seventh Heaven, Gonna rock around
	the clock tonight...

EBBY UNLEASHES A WILD ONE -- And decks the Bull Mascot.

EBBY IN THE DUGOUT READS THE NOTE from Annie.

EBBY STRIKES OUT a Peninsula batter.

EBBY UNLEASHES ANOTHER WILD ONE and a batter hits the dirt.

End "Rock Around the Clock" and--

						     CUT TO:

INT.  THE BULL LOCKER ROOM -- NIGHT

SKIP WALKS THROUGH THE PLAYERS ROOM -- Players are up, joking
irreverently.

		JOSE
	Hey Lefty, hold 'em to 12 runs
	every night, you'll win 20--

		EBBY
		(he might be serious)
	Had 'em all the way.

A DURHAM PLAYER SITTING HALF DRESSED in front of his locker.
A PICTURE OF JESUS hangs amidst his gear.  The player, JIMMY,
25, has a Bible and prays softly to himself.

		JIMMY
	Dear Lord, thank you for being
	with us tonight, thank you for
	protecting us from injury and--

DEKE WALKS BY, shaking Jimmy irreverently as he prays.

		DEKE
	Wake up, wake up--

MICKEY (A BLACK) COMPLAINS TO TONY as they undress.

		MICKEY
	This league is racist, man.

		TONY
	Every time you go 0 for 4 you
	think the league is racist-face
	it, Mick, you're an equal
	opportunity "out".

						     CUT TO:

THE MANAGER'S OFFICE -- A tiny cubicle, a desk, phone Larry
joins him with the pitching charts.  Skip studies the charts.

		SKIP
	He walked eighteen?!

		LARRY
	It's a league record.

		SKIP
	Struck out eighteen...

		LARRY
	League record.
		(beat)
	And he hit the Radio Announcer, a
	Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot
	twice--also league records--
		(beat)
	Joe, the guy's got some serious
	shit.

THE DOOR OPENS -- A PLAYER ENTERS, in street clothes, carrying
his suitcases.  CRASH DAVIS, 30, older than the other players.
And different.  More than just opinions, he actually has a
point of view.  A career minor leaguer, hanging on wherever
he can get a job.  Unlike Ebby--Crash knows a lot about the
world without baseball.  Also unlike Ebby--he loves baseball
desperately.

		LARRY
	Who're you?

Crash speaks slowly, with a trace of cynicism and pride,
like an old warrior who knows he's just a hired gun.

		CRASH
	I am the player to be named later.

Beat.  Skip looks out, half dressed, from his cubicle.

		SKIP
	Crash Davis?

		CRASH
	The Crash Davis.
		(beat, then nonstop))
	And you, Larry Hockett, should
	recognize me 'cause five years
	ago in the Texas League when you
	were pitching for El Paso and I
	was hitting cleanup for Shreveport,
	you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch
	of a 3-2 game in bottom of the
	8th and I tattooed it over the
	Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3--
	and I got a free wheel alignment
	from Goodyear.

		LARRY
		(remembering)
	Ohyeah.  I shoulda throwed a
	slider.  Damn, Crash, how're ya?

		SKIP
	I'm Joe Riggins.  Sit down

		CRASH
	I'm too old for this shit.  Why
	the hell am I back in "A" ball?

		SKIP
	'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
		(beat)
	The Big Club's got a hundred
	grand in him-

		LARRY
	He's got a million dollar arm and
	a five cent head.

		SKIP
	--we had the gun on him tonight--
	the last five pitches he threw
	were faster than the first five.
	96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97.
	97.  (beat) He's got the best
	young arm I've seen in 30 years.

		LARRY
	But he ain't quite sure which
	plane he's on, y'know what I
	mean...

		SKIP
	You been around, you're smart,
	you're professional, you know
	what it takes--
		(beat)
	We want you to mature the kid.

		CRASH
	"Mature" ain't a fuckin' verb.

		LARRY
	You go to college or what?

		SKIP
	We want you to room with him on
	the road and stay on his case all
	year.
		(beat)
	He can go all the way.

		CRASH
	And where can I go?

		SKIP
	You can keep going to the ballpark
	and keep gettin' paid to do it.
		(beat)
	Beats hell outta working at Sears.

		LARRY
	Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it
	once.  Sold Lady Kenmores--it's
	nasty, nasty work.

		SKIP
	Even if it's the Carolina League--
	this is a chance to play everyday.

		CRASH
		(angrily)
	You don't want a player, you want
	a stable pony.  My Triple A
	contract gets bought out so I can
	hold the Flavor o' the Month's
	dick in the bus leagues?!
		(angrily)
	Fuck this fucking game...  I
	fuckin' quit.

CRASH RISES TO LEAVE -- Picks up his luggage, and turns to
Skip and Larry before exiting.  A deep breath

		CRASH
	Who we play tomorrow?

Beat.  They know, they share the inability to quit the game.
They're all clinging to the Church of Baseball.

		SKIP
	Winston-Salem.  Batting practice
	at 4:30.

CRASH LEAVES and as he does -- Ed (the catcher) enters.

		ED
	You wanted to see me?

		SKIP
	Yeah, Ed, shut the door...

He does.  Remains standing.  He can see it coming.

		SKIP
	This is the toughest job a manager
	has, Ed...
		(deep breath)
	But the organization has decided
	to make a change--we're releasing
	you from your contract...

CLOSE ON ED -- Silent.  Motionless.  Empty.

						     CUT TO:

INT.  THE LOCKER ROOM --

CRASH PUTS HIS BAG IN A LOCKER as other players return from
the shower.  Crash watches as EBBY SOAKS HIS ELBOW IN A TUB
OF ICE WATER as the sports writer, Whitey, interviews him.

		WHITEY
	How's it feel to get your first
	professional win?

		EBBY
	It feels "out there".  A major
	rush.  I mean it doesn't just
	feel "out there" but it feels out
	there.

		CRASH
	Hopeless.  Utterly fucking
	hopeless.

						     CUT TO:

INT.  MAXWELL'S BAR -- LATER THAT NIGHT

Loud country music in the players' hangout and pickup spot.
It's full of players and lots of young women.

MILLIE SITS DOWN NEXT TO YET ANOTHER PLAYER, TONY, 25-- He's
slick, urban, smooth.

		MILLIE
	Hi, I'm Millie.

		TONY
	I'm Tony.  I play left field.

		MILLIE
	I know.

ANNIE SITS IN THE CORNER at her own table.  Max Patkin,
looking spiffy in a turtle neck sweater and double breasted
blazer, sits down next to her.  Old friends.

		MAX
	Love the game, Annie, love it
		(dead serious)
	When I die I'm gonna have my ashes
	sprinkled around a pitcher's mound
	in some ballpark somewhere--
		(beat)
	--and I'll have a few ashes saved
	for the rosin bag so I'll still
	be in the game after I'm gone.

		ANNIE
	What a sweet idea-

A COCKTAIL WAITRESS DELIVERS another round to them.

		ANNIE
	We didn't order this, honey...

		WAITRESS
		(she points)
	He did.

P.O.V. CRASH DAVIS SITTING ALONE IN THE OTHER CORNER.  HE

waves, and smiles easily.

		ANNIE
		(to Max)
	Who's that?

		MAX
	Hey--that's Crash Davis.  He's
	played in more towns than I have.
	Helluva guy--real different...  I
	actually saw him read a book
	without pictures once

		ANNIE
	Really?  Kinda cute...

ANNIE NODS AT CRASH -- He comes over to her table, greets
Max as an old friend, and introduces himself.

		CRASH
	I'm Crash Davis.

		ANNIE
	Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?

		CRASH
	I don't dance.

		ANNIE
	I don't trust a man who don't
	dance.  It ain't natural.

SUDDENLY -- HARD CORE ROCK AND ROLL on the juke box.  Several
couples dance, and out of the pack--

EBBY DANCES WITH A GROUPIE -- Spinning and whirling,
uninhibited and infectious.  He's suddenly dancing with a
different WOMAN, then another, and another...

ANNIE, CRASH AND MAX WATCH the mad performance.

		MAX
	Who's he dancing with?

		ANNIE
	All of 'em, I think...

EBBY PUTS ON A ONE MAN SHOW ON THE DANCE FLOOR -- The whole
bar stops to watch him, applauding as he spins to a finish.
A quirkier "Saturday Night Fever" show.  More naive, fun.
He climbs off the floor and joins Annie's table.

		EBBY
	Thanks for the note--you're right,
	I wasn't bending my back.

		ANNIE
	You got a live arm there.

He extends his hand to introduce himself.

		EBBY
	Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.

		ANNIE
	You need a nickname.

		EBBY
	That's what I been telling
	everybody!  Wanta dance?

		CRASH
	She's dancing with me.

		ANNIE
	Crash, I didn't think you--

		CRASH
	I'll learn.  C'mon--

		EBBY
	Just a minute, pal

The two men square off quickly.  Annie mocks them.

		ANNIE
	You boys gonna fight over little
	me?

CRASH RISES, pulling Annie with him.  But--

EBBY STANDS to challenge Crash.

		EBBY
	Step outside, pal.

		CRASH
	Love to--

		ANNIE
	Oh don't be such guys--

But Crash and Ebby head outside.  She turns to Max--

		ANNIE
	Hell, Max, wanta dance?

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  THE PARKING LOT -- NIGHT

A circle is formed.  Everybody gathers.  Millie clings to
Tony, her guy of the moment.  Crash and Ebby face off.

		CRASH
	I don't believe in fighting.

		EBBY
	Pussy.

		CRASH
	Take the first shot at me.

		EBBY
	I ain't hitting a man first.

		CRASH
	Hit me in the chest with this...

CRASH PULLS A BASEBALL from his jacket pocket, tosses it to
Ebby.

		EBBY
	I'd kill ya.

		CRASH
	From what I hear you couldn't hit
	a bull in the ass with a slingshot

		EBBY
	Don't try me.

		CRASH
	Throw it.  C'mon, right in the
	chest.

		EBBY
	No way.

		CRASH
	C'mon, Meat.  You can't hit me
	'cause you're starting to think
	about it already, you're starting
	to think how embarrassing it'll
	be to miss, how all these people
	would laugh.
		(teasing mercilessly)
	C'mon, Rook--show me that million
	dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a
	good idea about the five cent
	head--

EBBY REARS BACK AND FIRES THE BALL -- From ten feet away,
right at Crash's chest.  But, alas--

THE BALL GOES THROUGH A SECOND STORY WINDOW in the distance.
Crash never blinks.

		CRASH
	Ba11 four.

EBBY IS ENRAGED -- HE CHARGES CRASH, lunging at him.

		EBBY
	Who the fuck are you?!

CRASH LASHES OUT A SHORT LEFT -- With lightning speed,
effortless.  And brutal.  BANG!  Ebby goes down.  And stays
there stunned.  He looks up.

		CRASH
	I'm Crash Davis.  Your new catcher.
	And you just got Lesson Number
	One--"Don't think--it can only
	hurt the ballclub".
		(beat)
	Buy ya a drink?

						     CUT TO:

INT.  THE CLUB -- NIGHT

ANNIE AND MAX DANCE to Billy Eckstein on the juke box.  Millie
and Tony are also on the dance floor.

		ECKSTEIN (ON JUKE BOX)
	April in Paris, chestnuts in
	blossom, Holiday tables under the
	tree...

EBBY AND CRASH WATCH FROM THE CORNER TABLE -- Ebby's right
eye is blackened.  He holds a drink on it.

		EBBY
	We fight, she gets the clown--
	how's that happen?

		CRASH
	Shut up--I like this song...
		(sings along)
	April in Paris, this is a feeling,
	No one can ever reprieve...

		EBBY
	She's playing with my mind.

		CRASH
	It's a damn easy thing to play
	with.

ANNIE SUDDENLY APPEARS at the table.

		ANNIE
	Well--you boys stopped fighting
	yet?  Are you pals now?  Good.  I
	love a little macho male bonding--
	I think it's sweet even if it's
	probably latent homosexuality
	being "re-channeled" but I believe
	in "re-channeling" so who cares,
	right?
		(beat)
	Shall we go to my place?

		EBBY
	Which one of us?

		ANNIE
	Oh both of you, of course...

CLOSE ON EBBY -- His eyes full of fear and wonder.

CLOSE ON CRASH -- He smiles.

THE THREE OF THEM LEAVE the bar together.

						     CUT TO:

INT.  ANNIE'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

THE SHRINE OF BASEBALL GLOWS -- Annie lights the candles.

EBBY AND CRASH SIT ON OPPOSITE ENDS OF HER COUCH -- Both men
look around the room with wonder.  Ebby is clearly more
nervous than Crash, who's been in some strange rooms in his
minor league career.

		ANNIE
	These are the ground rules.
		(beat)
	I hook up with one guy a season--
	I mean it takes me a couple of
	weeks to pick the guy--kinda my
	own spring training...
		(beat)
	And, well, you two are the most
	promising prospects of the season
	so far.
		(beat)
	So...  I thought we should get to
	know each other.

		CRASH
	Why do you get to choose?  Why
	don't I get to choose?

		ANNIE
	Actually none of us on this planet
	ever really choose each other.
	It's all Quantum Physics and
	molecular attraction.  There are
	laws we don't understand that
	bring us together and break us
	apart.

		EBBY
	Is somebody gonna go to bed with
	somebody or what?

		ANNIE
	You're a regular nuclear meltdown,
	honey--slow down.

Crash rises to leave, and heads for the door.

		CRASH
	After 12 years in the minor
	leagues, I don't tryout.  Besides--
	I don't believe in, Quantum Physics
	when it comes to matters of the
	heart...or loins.

		ANNIE
		(challenging him)
	What do you believe in?

Crash at the door.  Annie's question is slightly taunting.
He stops, and speaks with both aloofness and passion:

		CRASH
	I believe in the soul, the cock,
	the pussy, the small of a woman's
	back, the hanging curve ball,
	high fiber, good scotch, long
	foreplay, show tunes, and that
	the novels of Thomas Pynchon are
	self-indulgent, overrated crap.
		(beat)
	I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald
	acted alone, I believe that there
	oughtta be a constitutional
	amendment outlawing astro-turf
	and the designated hitter, I
	believe in the "sweet spot", voting
	every election, soft core
	pornography, chocolate chip
	cookies, opening your presents on
	Christmas morning rather than
	Christmas eve, and I believe in
	long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses
	that last for 7 days.

		ANNIE
		(breathless)
	Oh my...
		(softly)
	Don't leave...

		CRASH
	G'night.

Crash heads out into the night.  Annie hurries to the-door
while Ebby sits on the couch, bewildered.

		EBBY
	Hey--what's all this molecule
	stuff?

ANNIE STANDS IN THE DOORWAY -- Crash is on the porch.

		ANNIE
	Wait, Crash--don't go--all I want
	is a date.  I'm not gonna fall in
	love with you or nothin'.

		CRASH
	I'm not interested in a woman
	who's interested in that boy.

		ANNIE
	I'm not interested yet.

Ebby appears in the door.

		EBBY
	Who you calling a "boy"?

		CRASH
	See ya at the yard, Meat.

Crash walks out into the Durham night.  Ebby and Annie stand
in the doorway.  She speaks softly to Ebby.

		ANNIE
	No ballplayer ever said "no" to a
	date with me.

		EBBY
	Well shit, then, let's fuck.

						     CUT TO:

INT.  ANNIE'S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

ANNIE PUTS ON A RECORD -- Edith Piaf sings "Le Trois Cloches".

EBBY STARTS UNDRESSING across the room.

		ANNIE
	Wait, honey, slow down--I want to
	watch.

She sits in a chair.  Piaf sings.  Ebby practically rips his
shirt off, exposing a great upper body.

		ANNIE
	No, no, no.  Put it back on and
	take it off slowly.

		EBBY
	Jesus, what kinda broad are you?

		ANNIE
	When you know how to make love,
	you'll know how to pitch.
		(turning to the stereo)
	Shh.  I love this part.

Piaf sings.  Annie listens.  Ebby re-buttons, then unbuttons
his shirt.  It drops, revealing his back.

		ANNIE
	Oh my--what a nice back.

Ebby drops his pants.

		ANNIE
	No, no, honey...  first the shoes
	and socks.

		EBBY
	The socks?  It's cold in here.

		ANNIE
		(sweetly, unthreatening)
	You think Dwight Gooden leaves
	his socks on?

Ebby considers this.  Pulls his pants back up.  Takes his
socks off.  Then his pants.

		ANNIE
	Ebby honey have you ever been
	handcuffed in bed?

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  DOWNTOWN DURHAM -- NIGHT

Deserted streets of the old tobacco town.  Crash walks alone.
He picks up an old newspaper out of a trash can.  He stops
in front of  a store window.  He rolls the newspaper like a
short bat.  He takes a batting stance, and--

CRASH TAKES HIS BATTING STANCE in front of the window,
studying his reflection.  He taken a "swing".  And another.

A GROUP OF OLD BLACK MEN stand in a doorway, watching.

						     CUT TO:

INT.  ANNIE'S BEDROOM -'CONTINUOUS NIGHT

CLICK -- A handcuff is locked onto Ebby's wrist.  Both his
arms are outstretched--he's getting very excited.

		EBBY
	Awright!  I read about stuff like
	this.  Bring it on!

Annie calmly drags a chair over and sits down.

		ANNIE
	Sweetie, have you ever heard of
	Walt Whitman?

		EBBY
	Who's he play for?

		ANNIE
	Well, he sort of pitches for the
	Cosmic All-Stars.

		EBBY
	Never heard of 'em.

Annie opens a book and begins reading as Piaf sings softly.

		ANNIE
	Good--then listen.
		(reading)
	"I sing the body electric.  The
	armies of those I love engirth me
	and I engirth them--"

		EBBY
	We gonna fuck or what?

		ANNIE
	Shh, shh...

	"They will not let me off till I
	go with them, respond to them,
	and discorrupt them and charge
	them"

SAME SCENE -- LATER

		ANNIE
	"Limitless limpid jets of love

CLOSE ON EBBY'S FACE -- Intrigued, aroused, frightened.

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  DOWNTOWN DURHAM -- NIGHT

THE OLD BLACK MAN is tossing wadded up balls of paper at
Crash who takes beautiful, fluid swings with the rolled up
newspaper.  Batting practice.

CLOSE ON CRASH'S EYES -- Studying the "pitches" with intense
concentration, endlessly working on his game.

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  THE DURHAM FIELD -- NEXT DAY

LARRY, DEKE, MICKEY AND BOBBY ARE SINGING at home plate as a
pre-game show.  Larry is Diana Ross, the other three are the
Supremes, and the routine is brilliantly tacky.

		LARRY (AND THE SUPREMES)
	Baby love, oh oh, baby love, I
	need ya oh how I need ya, All ya
	do is treat me bad, Take my heart
	and leave me sad...

						     CUT TO:

INT.  DURHAM BULLS LOCKER ROOM -- DAY

JIMMY STANDS ON A BENCH trying to get the players' attention.

		JIMMY
	Listen up, guys, could I have
	your attention a minute?
		(a few heads turn)
	I'm going to be leading a daily
	chapel service at three In the
	afternoons here in the locker
	room and you're all invited to
	drop by and worship before batting
	practice.

		BOBBY
	Jimmy, God damn it--loosen up and
	get laid.

BOBBY, 25, smooths the creases of his uniform, preening.

		JIMMY
	I don't care If you think I'm
	square but I believe what I
	believe.

All heads turn as:

EBBY ENTERS THE LOCKER ROOM -- He looks trashed.

		BOBBY
	Jesus, Ebby, what truck ran over
	you?

		EBBY
		(glassy eyed)
	Call me "Nuke".  Annie said it's
	my new nickname.

Lots of teasing from around the clubhouse.

		DEKE
	Annie nailed you?  That's great,
	means you're gonna have a helluva
	year.  Does she fuck as good as
	they say?

		EBBY
	We didn't do it, man--she read
	poetry to me all night, I swear.
	It's more tiring than fucking.

EBBY GOES TO HIS LOCKER and starts undressing.  Crash sits
next to him, looking straight ahead.  Bobby nearby.

		EBBY
	--of love"...hey, Crash, does
	that mean what I think it means?
	What's the deal here?

Crash studies Ebby.

		CRASH
	Your shower shoes have fungus on
	'em.  You'll never get to the
	Bigs with fungus on your shower
	shoes.
		(beat)
	Think classy and you'll be classy.
	If you win 20 in the Show you can
	let the fungus grow back on your
	shower shoes and the press'll
	think you're colorful.
		(beat)
	Until you win twenty in the Show,
	however, it means you're a slob.

CRASH RISES AND HEADS OUT to the field.  Ebby sits silently,
holding his shower shoes, taking it all in.

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  DURHAM BALLPARK -- GAME IN PROGRESS -- DAY

IN THE DUGOUT -- THE GAME FROM A DUGOUT P.O.V.  The players
sit, stand, stir restlessly.  A combination of relaxation
and intensity not visible from the stands.

CRASH IS HANDED HIS BAT and helmet by the bat boy.

		DEKE
	This guy's bringing some serious
	smoke out there.

DUGOUT P.O.V. THE WINSTON-SALEM PITCHER throwing hard.

		CRASH
	He ain't got shit.

FOLLOW CRASH INTO THE ON-DECK CIRCLE -- The ritual.  The bat
boy hands him the pine tar rag and he rubs pine tar on the
bat with great care.

CRASH RISES -- Heads to the plate.  Talking to himself.

		CRASH
	You ain't getting that cheese by
	me, meat.

CRASH TAKES HIS STANCE -- Upright.  Calm.  Head still.

		CRASH (VOICE OVER)
	Look for the fastball up.  He's
	gotta come with the cheese.  Relax.
	Relax.  Quick bat.  Pop the
	clubhead.  Open the hips.  Relax.
	You're thinking too much.  Get

CLOSE ON CRASH'S FACE -- His eyes intensely focused.

CRASH'S P.O.V. THE PITCHER -- Starts his windup.

		CRASH (VOICE OVER)
	Get on top of the ball.  Quick
	bat.  Don't let him in your kitchen--

THE PITCHER DELIVERS -- Crash strides.  Curveball.

Crash swings and misses, offstride.  Strike one.

CRASH QUICKLY STEPS OUT OF THE BOX and picks up dirt.  Rubs
it on his hands.  He's pissed.

		CRASH (VOICE OVER)
	You stupid fuck, Crash.  What're
	you swinging at a breaking ball
	for?  Why's he starting me off
	with a hammer?  Fuck me.
		(more dirt)
	You're okay.  Stay back.  Stay
	back, you dumb fuck.  Wait.  Wait.

P.O.V. THE PITCHER'S NEXT DELIVERY -- CURVE BALL AWAY.

CRASH STRIDES INTO THE PITCH -- Lashes a line drive down the
first base line.  Just foul.

Crash has started to first.  Pulls up.  Returns slowly to
the plate.  Picks up his bat.

		CRASH
	Throw that shit again, meat.
	Throw that weak ass shit.
		(beat)
	Now he's gotta try to slip the
	cheese by me.  one and one.

You're on top.  Now bring me the gas--

--P.O.V.  PITCHER'S THIRD DELIVERY -- High and tight.  Right
at Crash's head.  The ball seems to accelerate.  About to
explode his skull.  For a moment--THE FEAR OF DEATH...

CRASH HITS THE DIRT -- It just misses his head.

CRASH CLIMBS OUT OF THE DIRT -- Brushes himself off.

		CRASH (VOICE OVER)
	This son of a bitch throws hard.

	Annie, Annie, Annie--who is this
	Annie?
		(catching himself)
	Jesus, get outta the box you idiot,
	where's your head?  Get the broad

CRASH HOLDS UP HIS HAND to the ump.

		CRASH
	Time out.

		UMP
	Time out!

CRASH STEPS OUT OF THE BOX -- Motions to the bat boy for the
pine tar rag.  The boy brings it over.  Crash re-applies it
to his bat.

		BAT BOY
	Get a hit, Crash.

		CRASH
	Shut up.

CRASH WALKS BACK TO THE BOX -- Talking to himself.

		CRASH
	Awright, awright.  You've seen
	all his pitches.  Two and one.
	Relax.  Wait.  Quick bat.  You
	can hit this shit--

CRASH IN THE BATTER'S BOX -- Digs in-again.  Takes his stance.
Upright.  Relaxed.  Ready.

		CRASH (VOICE OVER)
	Shorten up.  Bring the gas...  Be
	quick--be quick--yeah, yeah...

						     CUT TO:

ANNIE AND JACKSON IN THE STANDS -- She's writing a note
quickly, and hands it to Jackson, who hurries off.

						     CUT TO:

CRASH'S P.O.V. THE PITCHER'S NEXT PITCH -- A major league
fastball.  It explodes to the plate.  Crash swings.  And
misses.  Strike Three.

CRASH WALKS BACK TO THE DUGOUT -- Head high, no show of
emotion.  Almost proud.  An old Warrior, not giving an inch
even in defeat.

HE RE-ENTERS THE DUGOUT -- Sits down and starts putting the
catcher's gear back on.  Deke leans over.

		DEKE
	Serious heat, eh?

		CRASH
	He ain't got shit.

THE BATBOY TAKES THE NOTE FROM JACKSON -- And hands it to
Crash, who refuses to accept it, being busy putting his gear
on.

		BAT BOY
	From Annie.

		CRASH
	Read it.

		BAT BOY
	Dear Crash.  You have a lovely
	swing but you're pulling your
	hips out too early.  I'd be happy
	to meet you at the Batting Cage
	tomorrow to discuss it.  Signed,
	Annie.

		DEKE
	Well if there's one chick'd know
	when you're pulling your hips out
	early, Annie's the one.

Crash doesn't seem too amused.  He grabs the note, and the
pen hanging from the starting lineup card taped to the dugout
wall.  He scrawls a quick note.

						     CUT TO:

ANNIE'S PRIVATE BOX -- She's watching the players through
binoculars as Jackson returns with the note.

		ANNIE
		(looking through the
		glasses)
	What'd he say?

Jackson looks at the note uneasily, then reads--

		JACKSON
	It says..."I want to-make...
	love to you.  Crash".

ANNIE PUTS DOWN THE GLASSES -- Takes the note.

		ANNIE
	Oh my...

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  A LOCAL BATTING CAGE DAY

ANNIE DIGS IN AT THE PLATE -- Bat in hand.  Crash a few feet
away.  Annie spits on her hands, wear batting glove, pumps
the bat back and forth.

THE MECHANICAL PITCHING MACHINE DELIVERS -- Kawoosh.

ANNIE SWINGS -- Lashes out a line drive.  Crash smiles.

		ANNIE
	See my hips?

		CRASH
	Yep.

		ANNIE
	I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.

		CRASH
	When you're hitting you shouldn't
	think about anything but hitting.
		(beat)
	But you shouldn't think about it
	too much.  The trick is to use
	your brain to not use your brain.

		ANNIE
	But you were pulling your hips
	last night.

		CRASH
	So...Wanta make love?

ANNIE SWINGS AND MISSES the next pitch.

		ANNIE
	I'm committed to Nuke for the
	season.  You had your chance the
	other night.

		CRASH
	What'you see in that guy--he's
	dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,

		ANNIE
	Young men are uncomplicated.
		(Crash mutters)
	And he's not "dim".  He's just
	inexperienced.  My job is to give
	him "life-wisdom" and help him
	make it to the major leagues.

		CRASH
	That's my job too.

ANNIE SWINGS AND MISSES another pitch.

		ANNIE
	Damn.

		CRASH
	You're pulling your hips out.

		ANNIE
	But they're nice hips.
		(beat)
	I looked up your records-- You've
	hit 227 home runs in the minors.
	That's great!

ANNIE FOULS ONE OFF and digs in gamely.

		CRASH
	Don't tell anybody.

		ANNIE
	Why not?  If you hit twenty homers
	this year you'll be the all time
	minor league champ!  The record's

		CRASH
	247 home runs in the minors would
	be a dubious honor, if ya think
	about it.

		ANNIE
	Oh no, I think it'd be great!
	The Sporting News should know
	about it.

		CRASH
	No.  Please.

ANNIE SWINGS AND MISSES another one.

		ANNIE
	Damn.

		CRASH
	Let me.

CRASH STEPS IN TO HIT -- He takes his familiar stance.  The
pitch comes.  Crash drills it.

		CRASH
	Your place or mine?

		ANNIE
	Despite my love of weird
	metaphysics and my rejection of
	most Judao-Christian ethics, I
	am, within the framework of a
	baseball season, monogamous.

		CRASH
	Fact is you're afraid of meeting
	a guy like me 'cause It might be
	real so you sabotage it with some
	bullshit about commitment to a
	young boy you
	can boss around--
		(whack--a line drive)
	Great deal.  You get to write
	self- indulgent little poems all
	winter about how hard it is to
	find a man even though you just
	sent him packing-
		(whack--a line drive)
	So what do you really want?  You
	wanta be a tragic woman figure
	wallowing in the bullshit of magic?
		(whack--a line drive)
	Or do you want a guy?

The pitching machine arm flaps.  Empty.  Silence.

		ANNIE
	Oh Crash...you do make speeches...

Crash puts the bat down, heads out the gate.  She follows.

A LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM ARRIVES -- Twenty-five 10 year olds in
uniform with a couple PARENT COACHES.

		LITTLE LEAGUER #1
	Hey, are you Crash Davis!  Can I
	have a autograph?!

CRASH STOPS TO SIGN AUTOGRAPHS amidst 25 Little Leaguers.

		CRASH
		(as he signs autographs)
	Well, Annie, your place or mine?

		ANNIE
	You got me all confused.

		CRASH
	A batter has two tenths of a second
	to decide whether to swing--

		ANNIE
	I'm not a real batter.  I'm a
	woman.

		LITTLE LEAGUER
	Hey, when are you guys gonna start
	winning?  You're terrible!

		ANNIE
	It's a long season, boys.

SUDDENLY A VOICE -- Nuke pulls up, gets out of his Porsche.

		NUKE
	Hey!
		(coming over)
	What're you guys doing here--
	stealing my girl?

		CRASH
	Now, Nuke, would I do a thing
	like that?
		(to the little leaguers)
	Hey kids, this is the great Ebby
	Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.

		LITTLE LEAGUERS
	It's Nuke, it's Nuke!  Can I have
	your autograph?!  etc.

		NUKE
	No prob, kids--

And suddenly Nuke is swept up into a sea of Little Leaguers.
Crash smiles as he turns Annie and the kids over to Nuke.

		CRASH
	See you guys at the ballpark.

Crash leaves Annie with Nuke and 25 Little Leaguers.

	Oh, that was just fabulous, Crash.

Several beats of silence.

		NUKE
	Crash?

He flips on a lamp near the bed.

		NUKE
	You mean Nuke.  You said "Crash".

		ANNIE
	I didn't say "Crash".  I said
	Nuke.

		NUKE
	You said "Crash".

		ANNIE
	Honey, don't ever listen to a
	woman when she's making love.
	They'll say the strangest things.

		NUKE
	You said "Crash".

		ANNIE
	Would you rather me be making
	love to him, using your name, or
	making love to you, using his
	name?

Nuke considers this fabulous logic.

		NUKE
	Yeah maybe you're right.

		ANNIE
	You see how nice things are when
	we go slow?

Nuke sighs; and lets his head sink in the pillow.

		NUKE
	Mmm, hmmm.

	You shoulda seen how many people
	came to the airport to see me
	off.  When I got drafted first it
	was the happiest day of my Father's
	life.

	He likes baseball more than I
	do...

		ANNIE
	You can learn to like it.

		NUKE
	I wanted to be the host of Dance
	Fever, somethin' like that...

		ANNIE
	Y'know if you make it to the Bigs
	you could still become the host
	of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a
	good stepping stone for things
	like that.

		NUKE
	God, I never thought of that.

		ANNIE
		(sweetly)
	There is a lot of things you never
	thought of, sweetie--now get some

JOSE FASHIONS A SMALL CROSS OUT OF CHICKEN BONES and rubs it

	Will that work for me?

		JOSE
	If you believe in Voodoo.

	I'm 0 for 16!  Gimme some of that

BOBBY HOLDS OUT HIS BAT for Jose to rub with the cross.

CLOSE ON THE ROSIN BAG on the mound.  A hand picks it up.

Puffs of rosin "smoke".  Nuke is on the mound.

NUKE NERVOUSLY WALKS AROUND THE MOUND -- Just before the
first batter.  He picks up the rosin bag.  Digs a slot for
his lead foot to land.  And CRASH APPROACHES, in full gear,
mask tipped up on his head.

		CRASH
	Don't try to strike everybody
	out.
		(beat)
	Strikeouts are boring.  They're
	Fascist.  Throw some ground balls,
	it's more Democratic.

CRASH TURNS AND HEADS TO THE PLATE and we hear the beginning
of Nuke's interior monologue.

		NUKE (VOICE OVER)
	What's this guy know, eh?  If
	he's so great why's he been in
	the minors for ten years?  And if
	he's so hot how come Annie wants
	me instead of him.

CRASH TURNS AROUND HALF WAY TO THE PLATE and returns to the
mound, as if he knows everything Nuke's thinking.

		CRASH
	And listen, meat.  You don't know
	shit.  If you want to get to the
	Show, you'll listen to me.  She
	only wants you 'cause she can

	Relax, have a ball out here.
	This game's fun, okay?  Fun, God
	damn it.

	And don't squeeze the ball so
	tight.  It's an egg.  Hold it
	like an egg.

CRASH SMILES -- And trots back to the plate.

NUKE'S P.O.V.  The first batter steps in.  Crash gives the
sign for the pitch.

		NUKE
	Fun?  What's he know about fun?
		(beat)
	Why's he calling for a curveball?
	I wanta bring heat.

		CRASH (VOICE OVER)
	Shake off the pitch.  Throw what
	you wanta.

NUKE SHAKES OFF THE PITCH -- Here comes Crash back out to
the mound before Nuke's thrown a pitch.

		CRASH
	Why you shaking me off?

		NUKE
	I wanta throw the heater to
	announce my presence with
	authority.

		CRASH
	"To announce your fucking presence
	with authority"?  This guy's a
	first ball fastball hitter.  He's
	looking for heat.

		NUKE
	But he ain't seen my heat--

		CRASH
	Awright, meat, give him your heat.

CRASH RETURNS ONE MORE TIME to behind the plate.

CRASH CROSSES THE PLATE, past the hitter.  He speaks to the
opposing leadoff batter.

		CRASH
	Fastball.

		NUKE (VOICE OVER)
	Why's he always call me "Meat"?
	I'm the guy driving a Porsche.

NUKE WINDS UP AND DELIVERS -- A fastball.

THE LEADOFF HITTER TEES OFF on the pitch and sends a line
shot over the right field fence.

CLOSE ON BILLBOARD -- "Hit Cow, Win Steak" sign, The home
run hits the cow on a target painted on the cow's rump.

The COW'S MOUTH OPENS AND MOOS.

THE BATTER STANDS AND WATCHES the home run, admiring the
shot, enjoying the moment.  CRASH GETS IN HIS FACE instantly--
and gets very tough.

		CRASH
	What're you lookin' at?!  You're
	showing up my pitcher, bush--get
	your ass in gear!

THE BATTER TAKES OFF ON A HOME RUN TROT -- Slightly scared.

AND CRASH HEADS TO THE MOUND where Nuke watches the Mooing
Cow and the circling batter with dismay.  Crash smiles.

		CRASH
	Guy hit the shit outta that one,
	eh?

		NUKE
	Well, I held it like an egg.

		CRASH
	An' he scrambled the son of a
	bitch.

	Having fun yet?

		NUKE
	I'm having a blast.
		(beat)
	God, that sucker teed off on it
	just like he knew I was gonna
	throw a fastball.

		CRASH
	He did know.

		NUKE
	How?

		CRASH
	I told him.

CRASH SMILES -- Drops the mask, returns behind the plate.

NUKE SIGHS -- Takes a deep breath.

		NUKE
	Don't think.  Just throw.  Don't
	think.  Just throw.

NUKE'S WINDUP AND DELIVERY -- A fastball.  A powerful, clean,
overwhelming fastball.  Strike one.

		NUKE (VOICE OVER)
	God, that was beautiful.  What'd
	I do?

NUKE WINDS UP AND DELIVERS HIS NEXT PITCH -- A monster.  An
Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh fastball.  Twenty feet wide of
the plate.

THE BULL MASCOT DIVES FOR COVER -- The ball hits the bat
rack.  Bats go flying.

	Christ, Skip and Larry are talking

NUKE PITCHES AGAIN -- The batter lines a single to right.

NUKE'S P.O.V. THE BULLPEN -- TWO PITCHERS start warming up.

	Don't yank me in the first, man.

NUKE'S P.O.V. -- THE MANAGER comes out to the mound to talk.

	Aw, shit.

THE MANAGER AND CRASH MEET NUKE on the mound.

		SKIP
	Relax.

	Don't pull me, Skip.  I'll settle

	Relax, Nuke, Relax...

	What kinda stuff's he got?

		CRASH
	I don't know.  I haven't caught

		NUKE
	I'm trying not to think.

		SKIP
	Good.  But just 'cause you ain't
	s'posed to think don't mean you
	ain't s'posed to use your head.

SKIP SLAPS NUKE ON THE ASS in a gruff, reassuring way, and
returns to the dugout.  Leaving Nuke and Crash.

CRASH SMILES -- And as he returns to the plate...

The Durham Bulls sit and stand quietly.

SKIP FLASHES THROUGH A SEQUENCE of signs.  Hand to face,
hand to belt, hand brushes letters, etc.

		JOSE
	That's the steal.

		SKIP
	Wrong.  That's the bunt.  This is
	the steal.

SKIP FLASHES QUICKLY ANOTHER SEQUENCE -- Hand to face, hands
to hands.  He speaks rapidly--a private language.

		SKIP
	Face is "skin to skin".  Skin
	starts with "S".  "S" stands for
	steal if it follows the indicator
	which is hand to eye 'cause the
	word "indicator" starts with an
	"I" so I figure "eye"--
		(touches his eye)
	--would remind you of "I" for
	indicator to indicate that what
	follows is the sign.  I figure
	wrong-- You're a buncha
	lollygaggers.

ANNIE BIDS NUKE GOODBYE -- Off to the side.  She pulls
something from her handbag and hands it to Nuke.  A pair of
WOMEN'S RED PANTIES, with lace and frills.

		ANNIE
	I want you to wear these on the
	road trip when you pitch.

		NUKE
	What?

		ANNIE
	They'll fit snugly against your
	balls in such a wonderful way
	that you'll start seeing things
	differently--plus they'll remind
	you of me which is better than
	thinking about those nasty hitters.

		NUKE
	Jesus, Annie, I don't know--

		ANNIE
	You've been pitching out of the
	wrong side of your brain.  These'll
	help move things to the right
	side.

		NUKE
	Big League pitchers don't use
	these.

EXT.  HIGHWAY THROUGH THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS EARLY MORNING

THE TEAM BUS ROLLS through the North Carolina landscape.

		ANNIE (VOICE OVER)
	This sort of spiritual awareness
	can be a mixed blessing, especially
	if you're dating a ballplayer.  I
	believe a woman oughta take care
	of her man so thoroughly that he
	can go on the road for a few days
	without having the desire to search
	out another pair of panties
		(self-aware)
	That is probably, however, my
	most ridiculous belief.
		(sigh)
	I just hope the boys start winning
	soon.  In some profound way I

DEKE TURNS UP HIS TAPE DECK -- George Jones sings "He Stopped
Loving Her Today".

MICKEY TURNS UP HIS TAPE DECK across the aisle -- Aretha
Franklin sings "R-E-S-P-E-C-T".

DEKE TURNS HIS VOLUME LOUDER -- Mickey does likewise, and
soon we have DUELING TAPE DECKS.  C &amp; W going head to head
with R &amp; B.  A cacophony.

SKIP LEAPS TO HIS FEET, WHIRLS and shouts.

		SKIP
	I got one word to say to you--
	Shut up!

Silence.

And then from the back of the bus, some soft, gentle, but
slightly dissonant guitar chords.

THE BACK OF THE BUS -- Nuke sits across the aisle from Crash,
who's re-reading Thomas Pynchon.  Nuke has a guitar and is
struggling with some chords to "Try a Little Tenderness".
He butchers the chords and the words.

		NUKE
		(singing softly)
	Oh she may get wooly, women do
	get wooly, because of all the
	stress...

		CRASH
		(in disgust)
	Gimme that.

CRASH STRONGARMS THE GUITAR from Nuke.

		CRASH
	I hate people who get the words
	wrong.  It ain't "woolly" it's
	"weary" and it nobody's got stress,
	they're wearing a dress.
		(beat)
	Listen.

CRASH WHIPS THROUGH THE FIRST FEW BARS of the song.

		CRASH
		(sings softly)
	Oh she may be weary, Young girls
	do get weary, Wearing the same
	old dress...

HE SHOVES THE GUITAR back at Nuke.

		NUKE
	How come you don't like me?

		CRASH
	'Cause you don't respect yourself,
	which is your problem, but you
	don't respect the game--and that's
	my problem.
		(beat)
	You got a gift.

		NUKE
	What do I got?

		CRASH
	A gift.  When you were a baby the
	gods reached down and turned your
	left arm into a thunderbolt.

Nuke looks at his left arm rubs his shoulder curiously.

		CRASH
	You got a Hall of Fame arm but
	you're pissing it away.

		NUKE
	I ain't pissing nothing away--I
	got a Porsche already.  A 944
	with A.C. and a quadraphonic
	Blaupunkt.

		CRASH
	You don't need a quadraphonic
	Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.
		(beat)
	In the Show, everybody can hit
	the fastball.

		NUKE
	You been in the Majors?

		CRASH
	Yep.

Tony and Deke overhear this and turn around.  And Crash gets
wistful, lyrical, and even slightly hopeful.

		CRASH
	I was in the Show for 21 days,
	once.
		(beat)
	It was the greatest 21 days of my
	life.  You never touch your luggage
	in the show--somebody else handles
	your bags.  It's great.
		(beat)
	The ballparks are like cathedrals,
	the hotels all have room service,
	the women have long legs and brains--
	it's a smorgasbord.

		DEKE
	The women are hot, eh?

		CRASH
	Yeah--and so are the pitchers.
	They throw ungodly breaking stuff
	in the Show--exploding sliders.

Nuke, Tony, and Deke murmur in awe at Crash's pronouncement.

		CRASH
	You could be one of those guys--
	but you don't give a fuck, Meat.

		NUKE
	God damn it I'm sick of you calling
	me "Meat"!  You wanta step outside!

CRASH HOPS TO HIS FEET as the bus barrels along, grabbing
Nuke by the collar.

		CRASH
	Yeah, let's go.

Nuke quickly has second thoughts--Crash can be terrifying.

		NUKE
	No.  Wait a minute.  Calm down,
	Crash...

Nuke sits back down.  Calms.  Reaches for a baseball sitting
nearby.  He hands the ball to Crash.

		NUKE
	Teach me how to throw a breaking
	ball.

Crash takes the ball gently and speaks softly:

		CRASH
	As I was saying ya hold it like
	an egg.

As the bus rolls through the country:

A LATE 60'S OLDS CONVERTIBLE ROARS PAST -- Max Patkin at the

HIS ASSISTANT (P.A.  ANNOUNCER FROM THE BALLPARK) has a phone

holding it up for Teddy who enhances shamelessly in his ON
THE AIR "play by play".

CLOSE ON PAPER -- His assistant writes "DOUBLE TO LEFT".

TEDDY HITS A TINY MALLET against a jar.  Thunk.  The sound
of ball hitting bat.  He punches one of several tape cassettes
cued up.  A crowd roars.  An array of special effects is at
his fingertips.

		TEDDY (ON THE AIR)
	...double off the wall by Higgins,

TEDDY'S VOICE PLAYS OVER road trip images:

NUKE STARTS TO PUT ON THE RED PANTIES -- Changes his mind,
and hides them again.

THE TEAM BUS rolling across North Carolina.

THE TEAM BUS at a drive through hamburger stand somewhere in
the Smoky Mountains.  Sack after sack of fast food is passed
through the window to Skip.

THE TEAM BUS PULLS INTO YET ANOTHER HOTEL and this time, a
Bus with a sign--"Holiday on Ice" pulls in next to them.

		TEDDY ON THE AIR
	Is the modern athlete a pale

CRASH PULLS THE LID OFF A BOX -- Several valve handles.

Crash turns several handles with an iron bar, and...

long slow arcs of water across the entire field.

The General Manager studies the field.  Hopeless.

He looks up at the sky.  Cloudless, sunny.

	Naw...

Nuke just stares at him.

		CRASH
	Go for it.

	If I get laid, you won't tell

	Hey, guys, pa--rty!

	Shut up and be cool, man.  Like
	Mickey there...

MICKEY "LOUNGES" WITH A DRINK and a cigaret.

		MICKEY
	You wanta make it to the Show,
	Rock, you gotta learn how to

NUKE LEANS ON THE BAR with an elbow, striking his version of
a "lounging" pose.

	around on the road trips?

		DEKE'S WIFE
	No way.  Well...God...do we have
	to talk about that?

		MICKEY'S WIFE
	I guess not...it's just that once
	I asked Mickey if he was faithful
	to me on the road trips and he
	said "in his heart he was
	faithful".
		(beat)
	What the hell does that mean?

	It means he's unfaithful--but

	everybody--shut up!

THE PLAYERS AND ICE SKATERS freeze in mid-party.

Tony, nearly nude.

	Christ.  Sorry ladies...

JOSE AND TONY HURRY OUT in their shorts.

CRASH PULLS OUT THE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL and hands it to him.

NUKE TAKES THE MONEY and hurries back.

rounded up are partially dressed.  Skip spots the women.

	We're ice skaters.  Can we go
	now?

		SKIP
	No.  I want you to hear my
	philosophy.  It'll do you some
	good
		(beat)
	Here It is.  This is a simple
	game.  You throw the ball, you
	hit the ball, you catch the ball.
	You got that?!

		(frightened)
	Yes.

		SKIP
	Are you lovely creatures aware
	that you are about to compromise
	yourselves with a buncha bums who

	Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we

	It's a miracle.

	Look, guys--I'm a man, I got needs
	too.  I understand this party--

	There's a baseball lesson in there

	Where's Crash?

NUKE STEPS FORWARD -- Hands Skip the hundred dollar bill..

		NUKE
	He can't make it.  Here's his
	fine.

		SKIP
	Aw Christ, he don't have to come.
	He's hitting .350.

	Don't you think that's a double
	standard--we're here and he ain't?

	Look, men--you got a choice.  You

	to the Major Leagues--I was gonna
	be a Big League wife.

	Pass the Pampers, please.

	Helluva guy--

Silence.

Crash flips off the T.V.  with the remote.

		NUKE
	Can I ask you something?

		CRASH
	What?

		NUKE
	What would you think of a pitcher
	who wore women's panties?

		CRASH
	If he had a good breaking ball,
	I'd respect the shit outta him.

Crash turns off the light.

CLOSE ON NUKE -- A bit of light spill on his face.  Eyes
open.  A long ways from sleep.

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  A CAROLINA LEAGUE BALLPARK -- NIGHT

CLOSE ON NUKE'S FACE -- He takes his cap off, wipes his brow.

He's pitching.  Everything in SLO-MO.

FANS IN THE BALLPARK LAUGH at Nuke, mocking his.

EXTREME CLOSE UP ON NUKE'S EYES -- Frightened.

SLOW FULLBACK ON NUKE -- HE'S STARK NAKED save for his cap

CLOSE ON NUKE'S FACE -- He awakes with a start.

		NUKE
	No!

CRASH LEANS OVER and shakes him.

		CRASH
	Wake up, it's okay...you're
	dreaming...

CRASH HELPS NUKE back to consciousness.  Nuke shakes his
head, trying to wake up.  Crash Is almost tender.

		NUKE
	I was playing naked.

		CRASH
	I know, I know--I have that dream
	all the time.  We're almost home.

The Bus continues across the Carolina landscape.

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  THE STADIUM PARKING LOT -- DAWN

The team bus pulls into a deserted parking lot.  A few of
the players' cars are parked.  Some of the wives and
girlfriends.  And Annie.

THE PLAYERS SHUFFLE OFF the bus.  Tired and beat.

CLOSE ON NUKE -- He looks worse than the rest.  He sees Annie
and waves.  She's waiting next to her old Volvo.

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  STREETS OF DURHAM MOMENTS LATER

ANNIE'S VOLVO PULLS OUT -- She drives.

INT.  THE VOLVO -- DAY

Annie is up--Nuke is down.

		NUKE
	God I'm tired.  What a trip I was
	lousy.  I was worse than lousy.
	Everytime I pitched--it was like
	throwing gasoline on a fire.
	Kaboom.  I--

		ANNIE
	What is this "I, I, I" stuff?
	You only talk about yourself?
	Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't
	I look nice?

		NUKE
	Sorry.  You look great.  I'm
	totally exhausted.

		ANNIE
	Good.  Total exhaustion can be
	spiritually fabulous.
		(beat)
	Let's play catch.

		NUKE
	Catch?

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  ANNIE'S BACKYARD -- MORNING

Flowers and birdfeeders everywhere.  And, 60 feet away in
complete, oversized catcher's gear--

JACKSON IN A CATCHER'S CROUCH -- Nuke stares, in his street
clothes, but now with a glove and ball.

		JACKSON
	Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in
	here, hum babe--

		ANNIE
	That's not necessary, Jackson---
		(beat)
	Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the
	sign.

He does.  Jackson flashes some ridiculous signs.

		NUKE
	This in ridiculous.  I'm a pro.

		ANNIE
	Just do what I say.  Now, which
	nostril are you breathing through?

		NUKE
	Which nostril am I breathing
	through?

Annie puts her hand under his nose.

		ANNIE
	The right nostril.  Good.

		NUKE
	My right nostril?

		ANNIE
	There are two important psychic
	conduits called the "pingala" and
	the "ida".  The pingala starts
	with the left testicle (or left
	ovary of the female) and ends at
	the right nostril.

She touches his left nut through his pants in a matter of
fact manner.  He stares back.

		ANNIE
	The ida originates at the right
	testicle(or ovary) and terminates
	at the left nostril.

		NUKE
	I'm really beat.  I need some
	serious "z's"--

		ANNIE
	The pingala is the nostril used
	for throwing a baseball.
		(beat)
	And if you discover before a game
	you're in the wrong nostril, it's
	easy to switch.

		NUKE
	Switch nostrils?

		ANNIE
	Right.  Okay, fire a couple in
	there.

NUKE TOSSES AN EASY PITCH to Jackson.  Annie's incensed.

		ANNIE
	You're patronizing me!  I will
	not be patronized--

		NUKE
	If I throw too hard I'll hurt the
	kid.

		ANNIE
	He's handled a lotta pitchers
	whose records were better than
	one and six.

Nuke gets a little steamed.  He feels his nostril, winds,
and fires a medium speed fastball to Jackson.

		NUKE
		(a bit angry)
	How was that?

		ANNIE
	A little better.

		NUKE
	Gimme the God damn ball!

NUKE WINDS UP and fires a pitch to Jackson.  Alas--

THE BALL SAILS THROUGH A WINDOW -- Crashing glass.

		NUKE
		(cynically)
	How ya like that?

		ANNIE
	Much better.  Your delivery was
	fully integrated because you
	weren't thinking about it 'cause
	you were pissed off at me.
		(beat)
	This is progress.

Nuke smiles and gives in.  And reaches for her.

		NUKE
	I give up.  Let's go inside, make
	love, and fall asleep till it's
	time to go to the ballpark.

She takes his hand and leads him up to the back porch.

		ANNIE
	Or...
		(taking his hand)
	...We could just take that sexual
	energy and save it for a few hours
	and re-channel it into your
	pitching tonight.
		(shouting)
	C'mon, Jackson, I've got some
	lemonade!

Jackson runs over in full gear to join them.

SITTING ON THE BACK PORCH -- A pitcher of lemonade.

		NUKE
	I can't keep up with you.  First
	you say sex is gonna make me a
	better pitcher--now no sex is
	gonna do it?!

		ANNIE
	It's all the same thing.

SUDDENLY NUKE'S FACE IS FILLED WITH ALARM -- He points.

		NUKE
	What's that?!

--P.O.V. A CARDBOARD BOX ON A TABLE NEARBY -- Scrawled in
larged letters on the side are the words "MAX PATKIN".

		ANNIE
		(matter of factly)
	That's Max.  His ashes anyway.
	He left no kin...

Nuke stares, unsettled.

		NUKE
	God...I think I'm gonna be sick--

		ANNIE
	Oh don't be silly.  Death is
	nothing to be scared of.  It's
	just another way of living.  It's
	just a fresh start--kinda like
	spring training.

Nuke thinks about this carefully.  Looks at the ashes, at
Annie, and at Jackson, in full gear, mask on his head.

		NUKE
	Death is like spring training?

		ANNIE
	Yes.  And so is birth.  Now look
	me in the eyes, Nuke--
		(sweetly accusing him)
	You haven't been wearing my
	panties, have you?

CLOSE ON NUKE -- Utterly bewildered.

						     CUT TO:

INT.  BULLS LOCKER ROOM -- NIGHT

NUKE PULLS HIS JOCKSTRAP ON over the red panties.

Crash notices the panties, and snaps the waistband.

		CRASH
	Hot.  Very hot...

Nuke looks around nervously, continues dressing quickly.

		NUKE
	Annie says her panties will keep
	one side of my brain occupied
	while I'm on the mound, thus
	keeping my brain slightly off
	center, which is where it should
	be for artists and pitchers.  She
	also said I should throw whatever
	pitches you call for.

		CRASH
	Annie's a smart lady.

Suddenly Deke spots Nuke's panties.

		DEKE
	Hey, fruit alert!  Check out the
	Rook.

SEVERAL PLAYERS GATHER AROUND -- Wolf whistles aimed at Nuke
as the players are dressing into their uniforms.

		NUKE
	Annie says there's no such thing
	as straight and gay.  We're all
	sexual creatures to start with,
	and we get formed into certain
	roles.

		TOMMY
	You believe that?

		NUKE
	When I'm one and six I'll believe
	anything.
		(as they dress)
	Annie also says that God is a
	woman.  You believe that, Crash,
	you think God's a lady?

		CRASH
	God's definitely a woman--but
	she's no lady.

		TOMMY
	This is all Commie bullshit.
		(beat)
	God has a dick, man.

		TONY
	God damn it, Jimmy, you're an
	expert--does God have a dick or a
	pussy?

JIMMY TURNS FROM HIS CUBICLE to answer the theological
question.  All heads wait for the answer.

		JIMMY
	The Lord God is tri-une--Father,
	Son, and Holy Ghost.

		TOMMY
	Father and Son.  Awright!

The guys slap fives, convinced God is a man.

		MICKEY,
		(baiting them)
	Yeah, but He is a brother.

		TOMMY
	Bullshit!  God ain't no brother!

Deke turns to Crash, full of despair.

		DEKE
	If there is a God, why am I hitting
	.200?

SUDDENLY SKIP AND LARRY APPEAR to restore order.

		SKIP
	Shut up!  This is a damn noisy
	clubhouse for a team that's lost
	15 straight.

Silence.

Skip takes off his cap--instantly sincere.

		SKIP
	Patkin was a tribute to baseball...

		LARRY
	...and one helluva guy.

NUKE WINDS AND DELIVERS -- An eye-popping fastball.  The
batter swings and misses.  Strike three.

						     CUT TO:

IN THE DUGOUT -- SKIP AND LARRY LOOK AT EACH other warily.

		SKIP
	Jesus--what's got into Nuke?

		LARRY
	I heard he's wearing women's
	underwear--and he's breathing
	through his pingala nostril.

		SKIP
		(spitting tobacco)
	I'm getting too old for this game.

P.O.V.  NUKES FASTBALL SHATTERS A BAT -- THE HITTER

	That's one of the mysteries of
	sex I guess...

dribbler to first for the third out.  And the players run
into the dugout.

						     CUT TO:

INT.  THE DUGOUT

NUKE PUTS ON HIS WARM UP JACKET and sits down next to Crash,
who's taking off his gear, readying to hit.

		NUKE
	I was great, eh?

		CRASH
	Your fastball was up and your
	curveball was hanging--in the
	Show they woulda ripped you.

		NUKE
	Can't you let me enjoy the moment?

		CRASH
	The moment's over.
		(rising to get a bat)
	If this guy starts me off with a
	breaking ball, I'm going downtown--

CRASH SMILES in his disarming way, and grabs a bat.

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  THE ON DECK CIRCLE

Crash kneels, rubbing the bat handle with pine tar.  He
studies the pitcher working the first two hitters.

CRASH RISES and heads to the plate.

CRASH STEPS INTO THE BOX -- Digs in.

		CRASH (VOICE OVER)
	I dare you to throw me the hammer--
	you ain't that stupid...

CRASH'S P.O.V. IN SLOW-MOTION -- The pitcher winds and

make the catch, whipping the ball around the infield.

AND CRASH GOES TO THE MOUND for a visit.

		NUKE
	Hey, I'm cruisin', man--what're
	you doing out here?!

		CRASH
	I want you to throw this one at
	the bat rack.

		NUKE
	Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the
	damn thing where I want to.

		CRASH
	It'll keep the fear of God in the
	hitters.  Trust me.

		NUKE
	You're the boss.

CRASH RETURNS TO THE PLATE -- Flashes a sign.

						     CUT TO:

	he's thrown 5 cuts on 9 pitches,

	point control here tonight, Bull
	fans...here's the pitch--

						     CUT TO:

NUKE'S NEXT DELIVERY -- A wild ass rocket thirty feet off
line.  The BULL MASCOT DIVES for cover.

						     CUT TO:

NUKE ON THE MOUND -- Bearing down.

		NUKE (VOICE OVER)
	Bear down, Meat, don't let up.
	You own these guys.  Dad'll love
	a shutout ...

P.O.V.  CRASH FLASHES THE SIGN -- Nuke doesn't like it.

		NUKE
	No, no--this guy's looking for
	heat--lemme give him the deuce--

NUKE SHAKES OFF THE SIGN Cocky, full of himself.

						     CUT TO:

ANNIE AND JACKSON in her box seat.

		ANNIE
	Oh no--he's shaking off the sign,
	Jackson.  Big mistake...

		JACKSON
	He'll learn.

						     CUT TO:

CLOSE ON CRASH BEHIND THE PLATE

		CRASH
	This son of a bitch is throwing a
	two hit shutout and he's shaking
	me off?!
		(to batter and umpire)
	Hey Charlie, here comes the deuce.

NUKE WINDS AND DELIVERS -- A hanging curveball.  The batter
takes an ungodly cut, and BLASTS a long home.

THE BATTER STANDS AT THE PLATE watching the blast...until
CRASH SHOVES HIM toward first with a sneer.  For a moment it
looks like there'll be a fight--but the hitter backs off and
takes the home run trot as:

NUKE STARES AT THE OUTFIELD WALL as the batter circles the
bases.  Crash walks to the mound.

		NUKE
	You told him I was throwing a
	deuce, right?

		CRASH
	Yep.  He really crushed that
	dinger, didn't he.  Musta gone
	450 feet...damn...

NUKE HOLDS OUT HIS GLOVE -- Says nothing.  Crash puts a new
ball in the glove.  Returns to the plate.

NUKE GETS THE SIGN -- Winds.  Delivers.  Batter hits a weak
one hopper back to the mound.  Game's over.

INT.  ANNIE'S HOUSE -- LATER -- NIGHT

ANNIE COMES OUT OF THE BATHROOM -- Dressed in a long, flowing
nightgown, elegant and old fashioned.  She looks fabulous,
PRESENTING HERSELF to Nuke.

		ANNIE
	I'm yours.

		NUKE
	Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if
	it works for one game, maybe it'll
	work for a whole buncha games.

		ANNIE
	Breathing through your pingala
	always works, honey--

		NUKE
	Not that.  I mean the re-channeling
	of my sexual energy.
		(beat)
	Maybe we shouldn't make love for
	awhile.

		ANNIE
	Now don't go overboard, I look
	incredibly hot, right?

She strikes a pose.  She does look hot.

		NUKE
	You know what it feels like to
	throw a three hitter?
		(nervously, with
		resolve)
	We better not fuck.

		ANNIE
	Nuke?!

		NUKE
	Just till I lose.

		ANNIE
	Get over here.

		NUKE
	No.

		ANNIE
	Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh--

She starts toward him--and Nuke flees.  Out the door, into
the night.  Annie slumps in disbelief.

						DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  ANNIE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

ANNIE SITS IN BED ALONE -- Lights a cigaret.  A puzzled
expression--things have got out of control.

		ANNIE (VOICE OVER CONT'D)
	Nuke was so encouraged that he
	took a vow to not have sex until
	they lost...

Annie reaches over, opens a drawer in her nightstand, and
pulls out her baseball glove.  She cradles it fondly in her
lap, puts it on, pounds it gently...

		ANNIE (VOICE OVER CONT'D)
	Y'see a ballplayer on a streak
	considers himself touched with
	magic and he'll do anything to
	keep from breaking the spell ...

						     CUT TO:

INT.  DURHAM BULL LOCKER ROOM -- DAY

NUKE NEATLY UNFOLDS THE RED PANTIES in his locker.

		ANNIE (VOICE OVER CONT'D)
	In fact the whole team started
	making religious connections and
	everybody got hot.

JOSE BLESSES THE BATS with a chicken bone cross.

JIMMY READS THE BIBLE and prays alone in the corner.

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  DURHAM BASEBALL FIELD -- DAY

PLAYERS TAKING GROUND BALLS and batting practice.

		ANNIE (VOICE OVER CONT'D)
	I figured Nuke would win a couple,
	then lose, and things would get
	back to normal ...

PLAYERS PLAYING "FLIP" PEPPER like kids.

		ANNIE (VOICE OVER CONT'D)
	But it didn't happen like that...
	and for one extraordinary June
	and July, the Durham Bulls, for
	whatever perverse reason, began
	playing baseball with joy and
	verve and poetry--

NUKE WARMING UP in the bullpen, listening to Crash.

		ANNIE (VOICE OVER CONT'D)
	The two sides of my own brain
	were all jumbled up and cross-
	wired...  while one side was being
	neglected, the other was in
	paradise watching our Bulls play
	like Big Leaguers...

MICKEY RIPS A TRIPLE UP THE ALLEY -- Slides into third.

DEKE AND TOMMY TURN A SPECTACULAR DOUBLE PLAY

		ANNIE (VOICE OVER)
	We swept a four game series with
	Kingston, back to back
	doubleheaders with Winston-Salem,
	and kicked the holy shit out of
	Greensboro in a three game
	series...

SEVERAL PLAYERS SIGNING AUTOGRAPHS at a local mall.  A line
of kids to meet them.  A banner--MEET YOUR BULLS!

		ANNIE (VOICE OVER)
	They were in demand all over town--
	and Crash, who kept hitting
	dingers, was approaching the minor
	league record...  though I told
	nobody.

CRASH BLASTS ANOTHER HOME RUN -- Another win.

JULY 4 PROMOTION -- LARRY, DEKE, TOMMY, AND JOSE dressed as
the "Spirit of 176 Drum and Fife Corps" at home plate,
surrounded by a Boy Scout Troop.

		ANNIE (VOICE OVER)
	After sweeping a July 4
	doubleheader, the Durham Bulls
	were tied for first.

THE WIVES, THE GROUPIES, AND MILLIE WAIT for the players
outside the clubhouse following a game.

ANNIE SITS ALONE IN HER BOX SEAT as the stadium empties.

		ANNIE (VOICE OVER)
	But beautiful as the winning streak
	was, I was getting damn lonely.
		(beat)
	Something had to be done.  I needed
	a man...

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  THE TEAM BUS ON THE ROAD BACK --DAY

The sounds of Diana Ross and the Supremes.

INT.  THE BUS -- DAY

LARRY, DEKE, TOMMY AND MICKEY as the Supremes, singing "Stop
in the Name of Love" at the front of the bus.

		NUKE
	I love winning, Crash, you hear
	me?  I love It.  Teach me
	everything.

		CRASH
	It's time you started working on
	your interviews.

		NUKE
	What do I gotta do?

		CRASH
	Learn your cliches.  Study them.
	Know them.  They're your friends.

Crash hands Nuke a small pad and pen.

		CRASH
	Write this down.
		(beat)
	"We gotta play 'em one day at a
	time."

		NUKE
	Boring.

		CRASH
	Of course.  That's the point.
		(beat)
	"I'm just happy to be here and
	hope I can help the ballclub."

		NUKE
	Jesus.

		CRASH
	Write, write--"I just wanta give
	It my best shot and, Good Lord
	willing, things'll work out."

NUKE STARTS WRITING them down.

		NUKE
	"...Good Lord willing, things'll
	work out."

		CRASH
	Yep.  So how's Annie?

Nuke looks up from his cliches, startled.

		NUKE
	She's getting steamed 'cause I'm
	still re-channeling my sexual
	energy--maybe I should cave in
	and sleep with her once just to
	calm her down.  What'ya think?

		CRASH
	You outta your mind?  If you give
	in now you might start losing.
		(beat)
	Never fuck with a winning streak.

Nuke nods seriously, listening to the master.

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  THE STADIUM PARKING LOT -- DAY

THE BUS PULLS IN -- Wives and girlfriends are waiting.

The players get off, greet their women.

ANNIE GREETS NUKE -- They head for her Volvo..

JIMMY STARTS ACROSS THE LOT on foot, dragging his luggage,
when Millie pulls up in her car.

		MILLIE
	Hi, Jimmy.  Want a ride?

		JIMMY
		(nervously)
	Have you accepted Jesus Christ as
	your personal savior?

		MILLIE
	No.

		JIMMY
	Can I give you my testimony?

		MILLIE
	You can do anything you want.
		(a tiny grin)
	Hop in.

JIMMY NERVOUSLY GETS IN WITH MILLIE They roar away.

						     CUT TO:

INT.  ANNIE'S KITCHEN -- DAY

NUKE SITS AT THE TABLE -- He's just finished eating.

Annie circles him.  A pot of soup on the stove.

		ANNIE
	I'm so proud of you and all the
	guys.  Want some more soup?

		NUKE
	No, no, it was great.

		ANNIE
	How 'bout a back rub?

		NUKE
	No, that's okay.  All I need's a
	little nap.

		ANNIE
	I'll tuck you in.

		NUKE
		(nervously)
	You can't seduce me.

		ANNIE
	I'm not gonna try to seduce you,
	sweetie...

ANNIE STRETCHES OUT HER LEG and lays it an the table.

		NUKE
	What's that?

She pulls back her skirt slightly, exposing her garter snaps
attached to her stockings.

		ANNIE
	That's my leg.

		NUKE
	I know what it is.

		ANNIE
	I figure we could work on some
	fundamentals even if we don't
	make love.

She strokes her leg.  Nuke stares fearfully.

		NUKE
	Fundamentals?

		ANNIE
	Sure.
		(beat)
	Unsnap my stockings.

Nuke squirms, then reaches for her garter snaps.  And stops.

		NUKE
	Crash once called a woman's, uh--
	pussy--y'know how the hair kinda
	makes a "V" shape?--

		ANNIE
	Yes I do...

		NUKE
	Well--he calls it the Bermuda
	Triangle.  He said a man can get
	lost in there and never be heard
	from again.

		ANNIE
	What a nasty thing to say.

		NUKE
	He didn't mean it nasty.  He said
	that gettin' lost and disappearing
	from the face of the earth was
	sometimes a good thing to do--
	especially like that.

		ANNIE
	Oh...
		(beat)
	Crash is a very smart man.  Now
	c'mon, honey, give it a try.

NUKE REACHES FOR THE GARTER SNAPS with two hands.  He fumbles,
groping awkwardly.  Annie stops him gently.

		ANNIE
	Watch...one hand--

WITH A SINGLE HAND ANNIE FLICKS each snap.  Flick, flick,
flick.  Magic.  The snaps open effortlessly.

		NUKE
	oh.

ANNIE RE-SNAPS THEM QUICKLY, offering her leg to Nuke.

		ANNIE
	Now you try.

NUKE TRIES AGAIN -- One handed.  Awkwardly again, but--

		ANNIE
		(sighing sexually)
	Mmmmmmm...oh yes...

BUT NUKE LEAPS TO HIS FEET -- Reacting vigorously, nervously,
desperately.  The soup crashes on the floor.

		NUKE
	No!  You're playing with my mind!

		ANNIE
	I'm trying to play with your body!

		NUKE
	I knew it--you're seducing me!

		ANNIE
	Of course I'm seducing you for
	Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn
	poor job of it--
		(beat)
	Aren't I pretty?

		NUKE
	I think you're real cute.

		ANNIE
	Cute?!  I hate cute!  Baby ducks
	are cute!  I wanta be exotic and
	mysterious!

		NUKE
	You're exotic and mysterious and
	cute--that's why I better leave.

Nuke starts to leave.

		ANNIE
	Nuke!  You got things all wrong!
	There's no relation between sex
	and baseball.  Ask Crash.

		NUKE
	I did.

		ANNIE
	What'd he say?

		NUKE
	He said if I gave in to you I'd
	start losing again.

		ANNIE
	He did?

		NUKE
	I'll be back when we lose.

NUKE HURRIES OUT THE DOOR -- Annie just stares.

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  THE DOWNTOWNER MOTEL -- DURHAM -- DAY

A run of the mill cheap modern motel.

INT.  CRASH'S ROOM AT THE MOTEL -- DAY

CRASH WORKS ON HIS SWING in front of a mirror.

A knock at the door.

		CRASH
	Come in.

ANNIE ENTERS the room.  Crash stays with his stance.

		ANNIE
	Crash...I want you.

		CRASH
	Nuke won't go to bed with you,
	eh?

		ANNIE
	He' s confused--

		CRASH
	Aren't we all?

		ANNIE
	Don't you think I'm pretty?

Crash puts down the bat, and looks directly at her.  As he
does he picks up two spring loaded hand exercisers and begins
pumping them an he talks.

		CRASH
	You're gorgeous, God damn it!
	From the moment I first saw you I
	knew I had to have you.  I had to
	have you!

		ANNIE
	I want to be had.

		CRASH
	I think of you and the "boy" all
	the time.

		ANNIE
	He won't make love to me anymore.

		CRASH
	And he's right!  A ballplayer on
	a streak has to respect the streak.
	They don't happen very often.
		(beat)
	You know how hard this game is?
	If you believe you're playing
	well because you're getting laid
	or because you're not getting
	laid or because you wore red silk
	panties--then you are!
		(beat)
	And I still think Thomas Pynchon
	is full of shit.

		ANNIE
	I want you desperately!

Crash can hardly keep up.  So he slows her down--

		CRASH
	Who are you?  Do you have a job?

		ANNIE
	I teach part time at the Junior
	College.  What if I told you I
	was through with Nuke?  He learned
	his lessons quickly and left me.

		CRASH
	And now you wanta teach me?

		ANNIE
	I don't imagine there's much I
	could teach you.

		CRASH
	I doubt that.

		ANNIE
	Crash, I get wet just thinking
	about you.

		CRASH
	I thought you wanted an
	"uncomplicated" boy?

		ANNIE
	I'm ready for a complicated man.

		CRASH
	--and as soon as we lose a game,
	he'll be back in your arms.

		ANNIE
	I said when I think about you, I
	get wet.

		CRASH
	Annie, I think you should leave.

Annie launches into a tirade without orchestration or self-
awareness.  She's frustrated, confused, angry and...

		ANNIE
	God damn you--what is happening?
	Is there no man who'll have me?
		(beat)
	This is the weirdest season I
	ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't
	lose and I can't get laid!

		CRASH
		(softly)
	You okay?

Annie slides against the wall down to the floor.  Tears flow.
Her makeup runs.  Her eyes are red.

		ANNIE
		(shakily)
	I need a drink.

Crash gingerly helps her to her feet.

						     CUT TO:

INT.  MAXWELL'S BAR -- DAY

ANNIE AND CRASH SIT IN THE CORNER of the empty bar.

		CRASH
	Why baseball?

		ANNIE
		(sighs)
	I was raised in a Baptist church
	got dipped in the water when I
	was 5-- born again before
	kindergarten...by the time I was
	10 I knew it was bullshit and at
	15 I ran away from home...

SHE SMILES at the most painful memories.

		ANNIE
	pregnant, had an abortion, got
	pregnant again, had an abortion
	again...gave up men.  Tried women.
	Missed men.  My mother died.
		(beat)
	I bought a car for $200 and drove
	to Ft. Lauderdale to bury her.
		(beat)
	And after we'd sung some hymns in
	some wretched Florida funeral
	home, I went outside and something
	happened--

Her tone becomes wistful, nostalgic.

		ANNIE
	The smell of cut grass in the
	warm March air overwhelmed me and
	I heard a noise--
		(makes the sound))
	--tok, tok, tok--and some men
	shouting...then tok, tok, tok.

Crash smiles slightly.  He knows.

		ANNIE
	I crossed the street--it was the
	New York Yankees spring training
	field--tok, tok, tok, was the
	sound of a ball hitting a bat--
	and I sat in the warm bleachers
	to think about my mother...
		(beat)
	And I saw him.

		CRASH
	Who?

		ANNIE
	Thurman Munson.
		(beat)
	He was covered with dirt and he
	was fighting with everybody--it
	was beautiful ...
		(beat)
	And he called the ump a cocksucker
	and got thrown out of the game
	even though it was an exhibition!
		(beat)
	So I stayed in the bleachers all
	spring and gradually came to
	understand what's so great about
	baseball.

		CRASH
	What's so great about baseball?

		ANNIE
	If you know where home plate is,
	then you know where 1st base is,
	and 2nd, and everything else--
	'cause they're always in the same
	place in relation to home.
		(beat)
	Don't you see?  If you know where
	home plate is, then you know where
	everything else in the universe
	is!

Silence.

		CRASH
	I don't know if I'd go that far.

		ANNIE
	It's true, It's true!
		(beat, down)
	Least it used to be true.  It
	ain't possible that baseball's
	not enough anymore, is it, Crash?

		CRASH
	It's possible.

		ANNIE
	No.

		CRASH
	Are you gonna be waking up next
	to 20 year old ballplayers when
	you're 60?

		ANNIE
	Well...I used to think that wasn't
	the worst thing in the world to
	look forward to.  Lately I'm not
	so sure.

		CRASH
	Why not?

		ANNIE
		(angrily)
	Whatta you mean "why not"?  Are
	you gonna play forever?!

Before Crash can answer--

SUDDENLY A VOICE interrupts.  They both turn to see:

MILLIE EXCITEDLY DRAGGING JIMMY into the nearly empty bar.

She leads him by the hand.

		MILLIE
	Annie, Annie!  There she is--we've
	been looking all over for ya.  Hi
	Crash.

MILLIE LEADS JIMMY right up to their table.  And as they
hold hands.  Jimmy stands there shyly.

		MILLIE
	Well tell 'em, honey.

		JIMMY
		(nervously)
	We're getting married.

MILLIE STICKS OUT HER LEFT HAND Displays a huge ring.

		ANNIE
	Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for
	you.

		MILLIE
	He's a virgin.

Jimmy squirms defensively.

		JIMMY
	Wellyeah...
		(to Annie and Crash)
	I guess that probably seems pretty
	corny to people like you.

		ANNIE
	Oh Jimmy, honey, I think it sounds
	wonderful!

		MILLIE
	Annie, will you be the bride's
	maid?

		NUKE
	Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch.

JOSE THE FIRST BASEMAN JOINS THEM ALL at the mound.

		JOSE
	Don't throw anything to me--my
	girlfriend put a curse on my glove.

		NUKE
	I'll take the curse off the son
	of a bitch!

		JOSE
	Then you got to cut the head off
	a live rooster.

		NUKE
	Shit.

MICKEY JOINS THE CROWD from third base.

		MICKEY

	No, no--I'm fine.  Millie, how
	much time did you and Jimmy spend
	together before he proposed?

Annie holds the dress up to Millie.

		MILLIE
	Five hours.  We both just know.
		(studying the dress)
	Do you think I deserve to wear
	white?

		ANNIE
	We all deserve to wear white.

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  DURHAM BALLPARK THE GAME NIGHT

CRASH FLIPS HIS MASK -- A runner rounds third heading for
home.  Here comes the throw, on a line.  It hits once on the
infield grass, takes a long hop--

AS THE RUNNER BARRELS TOWARD THE PLATE -- Crash takes the
throw.

THE RUNNER SLIDES -- Crash blocks the plate.  A cloud of
dust.  A close play.

THE UMPIRE SIGNALS "SAFE" -- And Crash flips out.  In a second
he is nose to nose with the UMPIRE.

		CRASH
	I got him on the knee!

		UMPIRE
	You missed him!

		CRASH
	God damn It, Jack, he still ain't
	touched the plate.

THEIR FACES ARE INCHES APART -- Screaming face to face.

		UMPIRE
	Don't bump me.

		CRASH
	It was a cocksucking call!

		UMPIRE
	Did you call me a cocksucker?

		CRASH
	No!  I said It was a cock-sucking
	call and you can't run me for
	that!

		UMPIRE
	You missed the tag!

		CRASH
	You spit on me!

						     CUT TO:

INT.  ANNIE'S HOUSE -- SIMULTANEOUS

ANNIE AND MILLIE STARE at the radio.

		TEDDY ON THE RADIO
	...I've never seen Crash so angry
	and frankly, Bull fans, he used a

		ANNIE
	God, he's so romantic...

						     CUT TO:

INT.  THE SHOWERS NIGHT

CRASH STANDS AGAINST the water, letting it stream across
him.  He raises a can of beer to his lips, drinks it slowly
in the shower.

As the water runs over Crash...

		ANNIE (VOICE OVER)
	When Crash got throwed out, the
	game got out of hand...
		(beat)
	...Jose made three errors with
	his cursed mitt...

JOSE BOOTS A GROUND BALL -- A runner scores.

		ANNIE (VOICE OVER)
	Nuke never quite got in the groove
	though he didn't pitch bad...

NUKE JUST MISSES WITH A PITCH -- Ball four.

		ANNIE (VOICE OVER)
	...and the winning streak came to
	an end with a 3-2 loss...
		(beat)
	The good news was that a man was
	about to come calling...the bad
	news was--it was the wrong guy.

						DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  ANNIE'S LIVING ROOM NIGHT

AS PIAF PLAYS on the stereo--A knock at the door.

ANNIE GOES TO THE DOOR -- Then refuses to answer it at first.
She hides in a corner.  Bites her fist.

		NUKE'S VOICE
	Annie!  You gotta be in there--I
	can hear that crazy Mexican singer!

Annie smiles slightly, and opens the door.

		NUKE
	We lost.

		ANNIE
	it's okay..

She opens the door fully.  Nuke's father stands there.

		NUKE
	I'd like you to meet my father.

		ANNIE
		(surprised)
	Oh--won't YOU come in?

						     CUT TO:

INT.  ANNIE'S HOUSE

AS THEY ENTER -- She leads them into the kitchen.

		NUKE'S FATHER
	Ebby's told me a lot about you.

		ANNIE
	Uh oh...
		(beat)
	Can I offer you some coffee?

THE KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS -- NIGHT

She puts a pot of water with a swirl of graciousness.

		NUKE'S FATHER
	Yeah...Ebby tells me you're a
	very spiritual woman.  He tells
	me you've taught him a lot about
	discipline and self-control.

Annie and Nuke exchange glances.  Nuke smiles.

		ANNIE
	He's a good student.

		NUKE'S FATHER
	We were worried that Ebby might
	get involved with the wrong crowd
	in professional baseball--we're
	so pleased, he met a Christian
	woman.

		ANNIE
	Praise the Lord, eh?

The Piaf record begins skipping in the next room.

		ANNIE
	Oh my--I better fix that.  Ebby
	will you help me?  I'm no good
	with mechanical things

Nuke picks up his cue and follows her to:

THE LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS--- NIGHT

Annie fixes the record.

		NUKE
	I couldn't dump my old man but
	maybe later I can sneak away from
	him...

		ANNIE
	You don't have to...

		NUKE
	I'm starting to understand what
	you're teaching me.  I mean the
	panties and the nostrils and all
	that shit...I mean I'm getting it--

		ANNIE
	So am I.  Nuke, honey, we need to
	talk--

Nuke gets very aggressive and playful, pinning her.

		NUKE
	Aw hell, let's have a quickie
	right here--

		ANNIE
	--but you're father's in there!

		NUKE
	Crash says I gotta quit worrying
	about him--c'mon, honey, we got a
	lotta catching up to do--

He pins her to the wall, she squirms away.

		ANNIE
	Nuke--we do need to talk!

						     CUT TO:

BACK IN THE KITCHEN

Nuke's father is studying pictures on Annie's wall.

CLOSE ON A HELMUT NEWTON PHOTO -- A nude woman, two afghans,
and a toilet.

CLOSE ON A PHOTO OF SWAMI PRABHAVANANDA YOGANDA

CLOSE ON A POSTER OF A MARIJUANA LEAF with the inscription
"Better Living Through Mexican Agriculture".

Nuke's father is a bit unsettled by all this, when:

The phone rings.

ANNIE SWEEPS BACK into the kitchen--saved by the bell--to
answer the phone.  Nuke trails.

		ANNIE
		(on phone)
	Hello?  Skip?  Yeah, as a matter
	of fact, he is here.

She hands the phone to Nuke.

		ANNIE
	It's Skip, for you.

		NUKE (ON PHONE)
	Yeah, Skip, it's me.
		(several beats)
	Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...

Nuke hangs up the phone.  Looks at Annie and his father.

		NUKE
	I'm going to the Show.
		(beat)
	They're sending me up to finish
	out the season with the Big Club.
	I'm going to the Show!

NUKE'S FATHER LEAPS TO HIS FEET and embraces his son.

		NUKE'S FATHER
	Let's have a quick word of prayer,
	right here, to thank the Lord for
	all this--

		ANNIE
	Oh let's not...

		NUKE
	I gotta leave first thing in the
	morning.

		ANNIE
	That's great!

		NUKE
	How can I possibly thank you?

He embraces her rather formally.

		ANNIE
	Just pitch well and do good.

Nuke hustles his father out of the house.

		NUKE
	I will, I will--C'mon, Dad, I'll
	dump you off.  I gotta find Crash.

As they exit, Nuke's father turns to Annie:

		NUKE'S FATHER
	God bless you.

		ANNIE
		(to herself)
	She will, Mr.  LaLoosh, she will
	...

ANNIE SITS DOWN in a kitchen chair.  An enormous sigh.

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  THE DOWNTOWNER MOTEL -- NIGHT

Nuke knocks on Crash's door.  Nobody home.  Tony is arriving
with his GROUPIE GIRLFRIEND to the next room.

		TONY
	Crash ain't there.  He never gets
	back till four or five--

		NUKE
	Where does he go?

		TONY
	Well, I'd rather not say.

		NUKE
	They called me up to the Show and
	I wanta tell Crash goodbye.

TONY COMES OVER AND GIVES NUKE a heartfelt "five".

		TONY
	Goddamn, that's great!  Jesus!
		(beat)
	Listen, Crash don't like anybody
	to know it but--
		(beat)
	Most nights he goes down to, you
	know, down to Niggertown.  To
	Sandy's...  the whorehouse.

		NUKE
	He goes to a whorehouse every
	night?

		TONY
	Don't tell him I told you--he'd
	break my neck.

CLOSE ON NUKE -- Disturbed.

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  THE BLACK SECTION OF DURHAM -- NIGHT

A CAB MOVES SLOWLY through a poor neighborhood.  Stops at:

AN OLD HOUSE -- Decades of ad hoc add-ons.

		BLACK CABBIE
	That's Sandy's.  Keep your extra
	cash In your shoes.

NUKE GETS OUT and goes to the door.

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  SANDY'S WHOREHOUSE -- NIGHT

NUKE KNOCKS AT THE DOOR -- A small barred window opens.

A face appears--a TOUGH BLACK, SANDY, 50.

		SANDY
	What'you want, kid?

		NUKE
	Jim looking for somebody.

		SANDY
	Who ain't?

		NUKE
	Looking for Crash Davis.

		SANDY
	Ain't here.

		NUKE
	I'm Nuke LaLoosh.  With the Bulls.

		SANDY
		(studying him)
	Your breaking ball's getting better
	but ya need a change up.

The door opens.  Nuke enters.

						     CUT TO:

INT.  SANDY'S WHOREHOUSE -- NIGHT

NUKE ENTERS TENTATIVELY -- Another world.  Grim.  Sleazy.

The Doorman leads him down a hallway full of doors.  A BLACK
PROSTITUTE enters a room with a HUGE REDNECK.  As they go
down the hallway, and as they do:

We begin hearing singing--raucous, soulful, drunk.

NUKE STOPS IN A DOORWAY -- Looks into the "waiting room".

--P.O.V.  SEVERAL HOOKERS in various stages of undress, sit
on couches and chairs.  Bored, smoking, ancient.  The ONE
WHITE HOOKER, a skinny 25 year old, accompanies on a guitar,
struggling to keep up.  And a couple HOOKERS are hanging
around a piano that--

CRASH IS PLAYING and singing.  He doesn't look up.  Crash Is
dressed but barefoot.  A cigaret dangles from his mouth as
he accompanies himself with decent cocktail lounge chords.

Two Hookers at the piano hum along.

		CRASH (SINGING AND PLAYING)
	But when she does get weary--Try
	a little tenderness...

NUKE STEPS INTO THE ROOM -- All the Hookers rise in
anticipation of a new customer.  Crash keeps playing, never
looking up.

		CRASH (SINGING CONT'D)
	You know she's waiting, just
	anticipating, the things that
	she'll never possess...
		(beat)
	While she's there waiting--Try a
	little tenderness...

Nuke interrupts the instrumental passage:

		NUKE
	Crash.  I'm going to the Show.

Crash Ignores him, keeps playing.

		NUKE
	Club's expanding its roster to
	finish the season--

		CRASH
	Shut up.  I'm playing.
		(singing last 8 bars)
	Oh you won't regret it, young
	girls don't forget it, lost in
	their own wilderness ...
		(beat)
	But it's all so easy--Just try a
	little tenderness...

As Crash plays on--

		NUKE
	I'm going to the Show.

		CRASH
	Then go.

NUKE GRABS CRASH by the hair and jerks him to his feet.  The
two men are face to face.

		NUKE
	I'm trying to thank you.

		CRASH
	Let go of me!

NUKE LETS HIM GO and Crash staggers drunkenly against the
piano, regaining his balance as:

SANDY RUSHES IN WITH A GUN to break it up.

		SANDY
	He makin' trouble for you, Mr.
	Davis?

		CRASH
	No, no, Sandy, put it down.
		(drunkenly, to Nuke)
	Nuke, you know Sandy Grimes?  Hit
	.367 at Louisville in 155.

		SANDY
	I hit .371.

		CRASH
	He hit .371--C'mon, Nuke--you and
	me, let's step outside and settle
	this.

		NUKE
	Settle what?

		CRASH
	C ' mon!

		NUKE
	I don't wanta fight you, I wanta
	thank you.  Let's have a drink
	and forget this--

		CRASH
	God damn it, you fucking virgin
	prick--step outside.

Crash drunkenly heads out the back door in his underwear.
Nuke reluctantly follows.

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  THE ALLEY BEHIND THE WHOREHOUSE -- NIGHT

Several of the Hookers follow to watch.  Crash is drunk and
lost.  Nuke in control.

		NUKE
	C'mon, we got nothin' to fight
	about.

		CRASH
	You fuck!

		NUKE
	Why am I a fuck?

		CRASH
	Why are you a fuck?
		(beat)
	'Cause you got talent.  I got
	brains.  But you got talent!
	You're God damn left arm is worth
	a million dollars a year.
		(drunken insight)
	All my limbs put together are
	worth 7 cents a pound--and that's
	for science and dog meat.

		NUKE
	You're a great catcher.

		CRASH
	Come over here into the light so
	I can kick your ass.

		NUKE
	No.

		CRASH
	Okay, I'll kick your ass there.

Crash takes a step toward Nuke.  Pulls up his bare feet
quickly, stepping on a sharp stone.

		CRASH
	...God damn...I forgot my fucking
	shoes.  Honey, go get my shoes.

One of the Hookers goes inside for his shoes.

		NUKE
	I'll take you back to the hotel.

		CRASH
		(drunken, mad)
	You know what the difference Is
	between hitting .250 and hitting
	.300?  1 got it figured out.
		(beat)
	Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at
	bats is 50 points.  Okay?  There's
	6 months in a season, that's about
	25 weeks--you get one extra flare
	a week--just one--a gork, a ground
	ball with eyes, a dying quail--
	just one more dying quail a week
	and you're in Yankee Stadium!

						     CUT TO:

INT.  THE WHOREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

THE HOOKER FINDS CRASH'S SHOES -- Starts to bring them out
to him when...she notices cash in one of them.  The Hooker
takes a few bills for herself, and continues out--

						     CUT TO:

BACK IN THE ALLEY -- Crash finishes his tirade as:

THE HOOKER COMES OUT WITH CRASH'S SHOES

He struggles drunkenly to put them on.

		NUKE
	Forget it.  You ain't worth
	thanking--

NUKE STARTS TO WALK AWAY -- Crash fires his one free shoe at
Nuke hitting him in the back of the head.

NUKE WHIRLS -- Comes after Crash.

		CRASH
	Come on, Meat...

CRASH SWINGS WILDLY -- Nuke ducks it and level s Crash with
a short right hand.

CRASH CRASHES INTO SOME GARBAGE CANS -- Lies there on his
back for several beats.  Nuke stares.

CLOSE ON CRASH -- Blood trickles from his mouth.

		CRASH
	Nuke...tell me something.  Did
	you hit me with your right or
	your left?

		NUKE
	My right.

Silence.  Crash's next line is both drunk and sober and we
don't know if he's just being clever or if, somehow, he's
staged It all.  Maybe even he doesn't know.

		CRASH
	Good.  Good.  That's terrific...

		NUKE
	What?

		CRASH
	If ya get in a fight with some
	asshole, never hit his with your
	pitching hand.  ya might get
	injured.
		(smiles)
	That's another lesson for ya--now
	quit fucking around and help me
	up.

CRASH REACHES UP A HAND FOR HELP -- Nuke stares back.

AND FINALLY NUKE REACHES DOWN AND HELPS CRASH to his feet.

		NUKE
	Ya look like shit.

The two men head inside.

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  DURHAM STADIUM -- NEXT MORNING -- EARLY

NUKE'S PORSCHE -- The Clubhouse Boy drags Nuke's out to the
car and loads the trunk.  Annie, Larry and a COUPLE KIDS AND
DOGS are watching.

						     CUT TO:

INT.  THE LOCKER ROOM -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY

NUKE CLEANS OUT HIS LOCKER -- Filling his travel bag.

Crash sits on a stool next to him.  Sober.

		CRASH
	Sorry about last night.

		NUKE
	Forget it.

		CRASH
	I have been known, on occasion,
	to howl at the moon.  D'you
	understand that?

		NUKE
	No.

		CRASH
	You will.
		(beat)
	Look, Nuke--these Big League
	hitters are gonna light you up
	like a pin ball machine for awhile--
	don't worry about it.  Be cocky
	and arrogant even when you're
	getting beat.  That's the secret.
		(beat)
	You gotta play this game with
	fear and arrogance.

		NUKE
	Fear and ignorance.

		CRASH
		(raging)
	No.  Fear and arrogance, you,
	hayseed, not ignorance!

		NUKE
		(smiles calmly)
	I know.  I just like to see you
	get all worked up.

Crash calms down.  Sighs.  Nuke nods and picks up his bags.

		NUKE
		(knows it's not true)
	Well, I got Annie all warmed up
	for ya...
		(knows it is true)
	She's just waiting for you to
	show up, y'know...

		CRASH
	I don't need a crazy woman in my
	life.

		NUKE
	Maybe you do.
		(quick beat)
	Y'know I'm starting to like this
	game--baseball's a helluva good
	way to make a living.

Crash speaks with quiet passion, from his soul.

		CRASH
	It's the best, Nuke...the absolute
	fucking best.

		NUKE
	Yeah, thanks for everything.

They shake hands, and Nuke heads out the door.

		CRASH
	Nuke--
		(Nuke stops)
	Good luck.

		NUKE
	You too...Meat.

Nuke smiles.  A little arrogance and fear.

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  DURHAM STADIUM -- CONTINUOUS DAY

NUKE TOSSES HIS BAG in the Porsche and motions to Annie.
They step away from the others.

		ANNIE
	Well I guess this is it.

		NUKE
		(smiles)
	I won't be needing these anymore.

NUKE PULLS ANNIE'S RED PANTIES from his jacket pocket.

The frilly, silk lace is tattered.  The panties have been
through the mill.  She accepts them graciously.

		ANNIE
	Neither will I.

		NUKE
	I think I'm ready for the Show.

		ANNIE
	Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't
	think too much.

		NUKE
	Don't worry.

They look at each other awkwardly, sweetly, and:

NUKE KISSES ANNIE GENTLY ON THE LIPS -- They hesitate, and
Nuke heads for his Porsche.

CRASH ARRIVES IN THE DOORWAY to watch.  Nuke bids farewell
to his father and climbs into his car.

		NUKE
	I gotta go now, Dad.

		FATHER
	I was thinking I could fly up and
	spend a week in the Big Leagues
	with you--help you get comfortable.

		NUKE
	No.  If I screw up, I wanta do it
	alone.  I'll call.

		FATHER
	We'll be praying for you.

		NUKE
	Dad--if my curveball is hanging,
	God ain't gonna help me.

		FATHER
	We'll pray anyway.

		NUKE
		(kindly)
	If it makes you and mom feel
	better, go for it.  I gotta run--

THEY SHAKE HANDS, AND:

CRASH'S P.O.V.  -- NUKE ROARS AWAY in his Porsche, leaving a
trail of dust in the Stadium parking lot.

						DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  DURHAM STADIUM -- DUSK

MILLIE AND JIMMY'S WEDDING -- A formal wedding on the
pitcher's mound.  Millie in white.  Jimmy in his uniform.
Skip is the best man, also in uniform, and several players
and groupies are the attendants, Annie as the Bride's Maid.

Organ music plays the wedding march.

JIMMY LIFTS MILLIE'S VEIL and kisses her.  The stands are
full of fans.

JIMMY LEADS MILLIE DOWN THE "AISLE" towards home plate.

						DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  DURHAM STADIUM -- GAME IN PROGRESS -- NIGHT

CLOSE ON SCOREBOARD -- Ninth inning.  Durham is leading by a
score of 1 to 0.  Two outs.

JIMMY IS PITCHING -- He delivers.  The batter rockets a line
drive up the alley.  A PENINSULA RUNNER races from first,
rounding third, trying to score.  A relay.

CRASH WAITS AT THE PLATE -- Here comes the runner.  Here
comes the throw.  A close play.  A terrible collision.

Crash goes rolling.  The umpire waits--and in a cloud of
dust, Crash holds up the ball.

THE CROWD ROARS -- Jimmy jumps victoriously in the air.

						     CUT TO:

INT.  THE LOCKER ROOM -- NIGHT

The air of victory.  The mood is up and goofy.  Beer cans
are squirted at Jimmy, the groom.

		JIMMY
	I wanta thank everybody and the
	Lord for the victory, it's a
	wonderful way to celebrate my
	marriage--and I guess we're all
	back on a winning streak, eh?l A
	few raucous "Fuckin A's" from the
	team.

		TONY
	Hey, Jimmy--we chipped in and
	kind got a little gift for ya of
	a special wedding cake from the
	Durham Bulls.

DEKE CARRIES OUT AN WEDDING CAKE -- It's X-Rated.  The
decorative Bride and Groom are fucking.  Jimmy's embarrassed
but it's all good natured.

						     CUT TO:

CRASH COMING OUT OF THE SHOWER -- Toweling off, watching the
innocent, vulgar fun.  He sits down in front of his locker,
drying his hair, when the CLUBHOUSE BOY approaches:

		CLUBHOUSE BOY
	Hey, Crash--Skip wants to see ya.

CRASH RISES AND HEADS FOR SKIP'S CUBICLE -- Wearing only a
towel and his shower shoes.

						     CUT TO:

INSIDE SKIP'S OFFICE -- Skip and Larry sit in postgame
routine, checking charts, smoking, half dressed.

CRASH ENTERS as he's still drying off.

		CRASH
	Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?

		SKIP
	Crash, shut the door.

And it hits him.  Crash looks at Skip, who looks down at the
floor, unwilling to face Crash who then looks at Larry, who
also looks away nervously.

CRASH SHUTS THE DOOR -- The party rages beyond.

		SKIP
		(heartfelt)
	This is the toughest job a manager
	has...

CLOSE ON CRASH -- He's been in the game too long to be
surprised; nonetheless, he's surprised.  And hurt.  His
stoicism is professional.

		SKIP
	The organization wants to make a
	change...now that Nuke's gone
	they wanta bring up some young
	catcher...

		LARRY
	Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg
	...probably a bust.

		SKIP
	I put in a word for you with the
	organization--told 'em I thought
	you'd make a fine minor league
	manager someday...Might be an
	opening at Salem next year--

EXTREME CLOSE UP ON CRASH -- His eyes are moist.

		SKIP
	Helluva year, Crash--you know how
	it is.

Silence.

Crash stands there nearly nude.  He just nods slightly.
Without rancor or bitterness, he turns and re-enters the
raucous locker room.

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  STREETS OF DURHAM -- NIGHT

CRASH WALKS THE STREETS ALONE -- Crash stops in front of a
window and takes his batting stroke, studying the reflection.

And he keeps walking into:

						     CUT TO:

EXT/INT.  CHEAP BAR IN DOWNTOWN DURHAM -- NIGHT

CRASH DRINKING ALONE at the end of a bar.

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  STREETS OF DURHAM -- NIGHT

CRASH WANDERS ALONG into the residential neighborhoods.

HE STARTS ACROSS A QUIET INTERSECTION Stops.  Looks at the
street signs.  He CHANGES DIRECTION, walks on.

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  ANNIE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

The windows glow.  After midnight.

CRASH STARES AT THE HOUSE -- Hesitates, then walks up the
porch stairs.  Knocks at the door.  Moments later:

ANNIE OPENS THE DOOR -- She looks beautiful.  Almost as if
she was expecting him.  At first, silence.  Then:

		CRASH
	I got released.

		ANNIE
	I heard already.

SHE OPENS THE DOOR -- Crash enters Annie's house.

						     CUT TO:

INT.  ANNIE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

ANNIE PUTS ON her favorite Piaf record.

ANNIE POURS A DRINK for both of them.

CRASH PUTS A HAND ON HER HIP -- Annie closes her eyes, a
tiny gasp.  He kisses her forehead.  She kisses his neck.  A
tiny smile from Crash.  The same from Annie.

SHE KISSES HIM on the corner of his mouth.  Her hand finds
the back of his head and she runs her fingers through his
hair.

CRASH RESPONDS -- They kiss slowly, deeply.  As--

HIS HAND ON HER HIP PULLS UP HER SKIRT -- By degrees, the
skirt is raised up her stocking covered leg.  At last exposing
the beloved-

BLACK GARTER SNAPS -- Crash's hand expertly holds up the
skirt and effortlessly UNSNAPS THE GARTER with a minimum of
effort.

FLICK, FLICK, FLICK -- The garter snaps are free.

		ANNIE
	Oh my...

						DISSOLVE TO:

THE BEDROOM -- Crash carries Annie to the bed.

						DISSOLVE TO:

ANNIE'S FOOT KICKS OVER A LAMP onto the floor.

						DISSOLVE TO:

ANNIE'S BLOUSE FRONT -- Flick, flick, flick.  Crash unbuttons
it with one hand in seconds.  Even Annie is startled with
the speed and ease of Crash's hand.

						DISSOLVE TO:

HER HAND SLIDES UNDER THE WAISTBAND of his underwear

						DISSOLVE TO:

HIS HAND SLIDES UP UNDER HER panties.

						DISSOLVE TO:

A FULL EMBRACE ON THE EDGE OF THE BED -- Remnants of clothes
cover parts of their bodies.  They tumble out of control to
the floor.

						DISSOLVE TO:

ANNIE'S HAND GRABS ONTO A DRESSER LEG -- A carved oak antique,
her hand holds on tight and shakes the dresser.

						DISSOLVE TO:

THE DRESSER TOP SHAKES -- Makeup bottles and pictures and
dozens of Annie's special things rattle and fall

						DISSOLVE TO:

ANNIE'S READ RESTS ON CRASH'S STOMACH -- Post coital, they
lie on the floor blissfully as Piaf finishes.

						DISSOLVE TO:

ANNIE CHANGES THE RECORD to Hank Williams.

						   DISSOLVE:

THE KITCHEN -- ANNIE AND CRASH eat an after mid after sex
snack.  Crash eats a bowl of Wheaties.  They each wear one
of her robes.

						   DISSOLVE"

Annie sits, munching a carrot and rolling a joint of marijuana
she keeps in a Victorian jewel box.

		ANNIE
	...  so you see in a former
	lifetime I'm sure that I was
	Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia?
	What do you think?

		CRASH
	How come in former lifetimes,
	everybody was someone famous?
		(beat)
	How come nobody ever says they
	were Joe Schmo?

		ANNIE
	It doesn't work like that.
		(stares at him)
	God, you're gorgeous.  Want to
	dance?

THEY KISS AGAIN -- And fall gradually onto the table top.

						DISSOLVE TO:

ANNIE SITS ON TOP OF CRASH lying on the kitchen table.

He stretches out a leg and:

KICKS THE BOWL OF CEREAL to the floor.  It smashes--

ceramics, milk, cereal go everywhere.  As:

THEY START MAKING LOVE AGAIN in the glaring kitchen light.

						DISSOLVE TO:

CRASH AND ANNIE DANCE in her living room.

						DISSOLVE TO:

THE BEDROOM -- Crash is handcuffed to the bed.  He seems
perfectly happy as Annie reads Walt Whitman.

		ANNIE
	...mouth, tongue, lips, teeth,
	roof of the mouth, jaws, and the
	jaw hinges...

						DISSOLVE TO:

ANNIE HANDCUFFED TO THE BED -- Crash reads.

		CRASH
	...wrist and wrist joints, hand,
	palm, knuckles, thumb, fore-finger,
	finger-joints, finger-nail...

						DISSOLVE TO:

CRASH AT ANNIE'S RECORD COLLECTION -- He thumbs through it
quickly, puts on a new record.

The Dominoes sing "Sixty Minute Man".  And...

						DISSOLVE TO:

THE BATHROOM -- Candlelight around the bathtub.  All we can
make out is two heads, two bodies, sloshing wildly In the
dim glow.  Water splashes, dowses some candles.

						DISSOLVE TO:

CRASH AND ANNIE IN BED READING -- Each with a copy of a Thomas
Pynchon novel.  Crash tosses it aside.  And disappears under
the sheets, playing with her as she struggles to keep reading.
She puts down the book.

						DISSOLVE TO:

ANNIE APPLYING EYE MAKEUP TO CRASH -- Who doesn't resist,
seems even amused.  He kisses her deeply, slowly.  She kisses
him back.  They fall onto the bed.

						DISSOLVE TO:

P.O.V.  OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW -- Dawn.  A bird chirps.

And we hear a record skipping, repeating endlessly.

PAN ACROSS THE KITCHEN -- Overturned chairs, spilled and
broken cereal bowls, liquor bottles.

PAN ACROSS THE BEDROOM -- A disaster.  Clothes scattered
across the floor, overturned lamps, the bed lies at a cockeyed
angle.  Annie and Crash lie face down -- asleep, utterly
spent.

CRASH WAKES UP SLOWLY -'Reaches up and pulls his underwear
off of a lampshade, pulls them on, and gets slowly out of
bed.  He staggers across the bedroom floor, stumbling a bit,
into:

THE LIVING ROOM -- He stumbles across the trashed room.
Record album covers, more liquor bottles, pillows, cushions,
pictures hanging crookedly on the wall.

CRASH TAKES THE SKIPPING RECORD off the player and breathes
a sigh of relief.  He sees his pants lying on the floor and
pulls them on.

CRASH OPENS A DRAWER -- Pulls out a piece of paper and a
pencil.  He starts writing...

						DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  THE BEDROOM -- LATER

Sun streams in.  Annie opens her eyes.  Rubs them.  Reaches
over for Crash.  Her hand hits a note.  She whirls.  He's
gone.  Only a note.

SHE SITS UP WITH A START and reads the note.

		ANNIE (VOICE OVER)
	Crash said he had to get an early
	start to drive to Asheville in
	the South Atlantic League where
	he heard they might need a catcher
	to finish out the season...

ZOOM IN EXTREME CLOSE UP OF NOTE -- "Love, Crash".

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  GREAT SMOKY MOUNTAINS -- DAY

CRASH IN HIS CAR heading for Asheville.

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  ASHEVILLE BASEBALL PARK -- DAY

CRASH KNOCKING ON THE BASEBALL OFFICE DOOR -- Looking for
work.

						     CUT TO:

INT.  ASHEVILLE LOCKER ROOM -- DAY

CRASH UNLOADING HIS GEAR Into yet another locker.

						     CUT TO:

INT.  ANNIE'S KITCHEN -- DAY

ANNIE SCRUBBING HER KITCHEN FLOOR -- Down on her hands and
knees, picking up the broken cereal bowl.

		ANNIE (VOICE OVER CONT'D)
	The house smelled like sex for
	days.  It was wonderful.  The
	only real cleaning I did was on
	the kitchen floor 'cause who likes
	to walk on spilt cereal?

SHE FINDS A BIT OF A JOINT on the floor as she's cleaning.
She picks it up, sits on the floor under the table, and lights
the tiny joint.

		ANNIE (VOICE OVER CONT'D)
	The funny thing is, I stopped
	worrying about Nuke.  Somehow I
	knew nothing would stop him.
	Crash was right--Nuke had a gift.

						DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  INSIDE A MAJOR LEAGUE STADIUM (ATLANTA) -- DAY

NUKE IN STREET CLOTHES IN THE DUGOUT of an empty stadium.
50,000 seats.  Slick.  Awesome.  He's being interviewed by a
BIG LEAGUE REPORTER, who has a small tape deck and has stuck
mike in Nuke's face.

		NUKE
		(like a big leaguer)
	Y'know, I'm just happy to be here
	and hope I can help the ballclub.
	I just want to give it my best
	shot and good Lord willing,
	things'll work out...  gotta play
	'em one day at a time, Y'know...

THE BIG LEAGUE REPORTER nods attentively as Nuke knowingly
delivers the cliches like a veteran.

						DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  ASHEVILLE STADIUM -- DAY

In sharpest contrast to the Big League stadium, a rickety
old wooden grandstand, carved into the pine covered hillside.

CRASH STEPS TO THE PLATE -- In a uniform we've never seen
him in, of course.  The Asheville Tourists.  He picks up
some dirt, rubs it on his hands.  He's as intense as ever.
Still playing for keeps.

		CRASH (VOICE OVER)
		(at the plate)
	C'mon, Meat, throw me that weak
	ass shit--c'mon, bring the heat,
	bring it, bring it...

CRASH'S P.O.V.  -- SLO-MO AS THE PITCHER WINDS AND

delivers a fastball right down the pipe.

						     CUT TO:

INT.  ANNIE'S BEDROOM -- AFTERNOON

ANNIE LIES IN BED READING -- She suddenly jerks up.

		ANNIE (VOICE OVER CONT'D)
	I was reading in bed when Crash
	hit his 247th home run.  I knew
	the moment it happened...

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  ASHEVILLE STADIUM -- DAY

CRASH UNLOADS A MONSTROUS HOME RUN deep into the trees.  He
stands at home plate watching it...like Reggie or the Babe.

And doesn't move.  For several seconds he indulges himself
uncharacteristically--until...

THE OPPOSING CATCHER SHOVES HIM toward first.

		CATCHER
	Get your ass in gear...

CRASH SMILES and takes the home run trot slowly.  As he heads
toward first, HE RAISES A CLINCHED FIST for a brief moment,
a tiny gesture of triumph.  And then, routinely, he just
circles the bases.

A HUNDRED FANS APPLAUD ROUTINELY as he circles the bases.

						     CUT TO:

INT.  ANNIE'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

SHE LIGHTS A CANDLE for the home run.  Above the candles,
displayed in the shrine, are her RED PANTIES.

		ANNIE (VOICE OVER CONT'D)
	I lit a candle for Crash's
	dinger...and tried to root the
	Durham Bulls home to a pennant.

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  DURHAM STADIUM -- DAY

ANNIE AND JACKSON OPEN AN UMBRELLA in her familiar place in
the stadium.  Umbrellas go up all around, as:

THE RAINS COME -- The players huddle-in the dugouts.

IN THE DUGOUT Skip and Larry reading copies of "The Tantric
Yoga of Sex".  And spitting tobacco.

		ANNIE (VOICE OVER CONT'D)
	The Kid from Lynchburg wasn't
	good enough to hold Crash's
	jockstrap if ya ask me, and Nuke's
	replacement had a fastball that I
	coulda hit
		(beat)
	We had a three game lead with two
	weeks to go when the rains came.

THE GROUND CREW DRAGS TARPS over the mound and the plate.

		ANNIE (VOICE OVER CONT'D)
	It rained and rained and I thought
	of driving down to Asheville to
	see Crash but then I thought "No,
	what you pursue, eludes you".  I
	had to trust Quantum Physics and
	the Church of Baseball.
		(beat)
	It ain't always easy being this
	religious...

ANNIE AND JACKSON POP OPEN THEIR UMBRELLAS and walk out of
the ballpark towards home.

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  DURHAM NEIGHBORHOOD -- DAY

ANNIE AND JACKSON UNDER UMBRELLAS -- He turns down one street,
she heads toward home.

						     CUT TO:

EXT.  ANNIE'S HOUSE -- DAY

AS SHE APPROACHES -- She stops.  Looks up.  Crash's beat up
car in the driveway.

P.O.V.  CRASH SITTING ON THE PORCH SWING Still raining.

CLOSE ON ANNIE -- She hesitates, and smiles.

		ANNIE
	Oh my...

ANNIE SITS DOWN on the porch owing next to Crash.

		ANNIE
	What happened?

		CRASH
	I quit.  Hit my dinger and hung
	'em up.

A moment of silence over the significance of him quitting.

		ANNIE
	I'm quitting too.  Boys, not
	baseball.

		CRASH
	There  might be an opening for a
	manager at Salem next spring.

		ANNIE
	Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all
	the witches were?

		CRASH
	Yeah...you a witch?

		ANNIE
	Not yet.  It takes years of
	practice...

He smiles slightly and takes her hand.

		CRASH
	You think I could make it to the
	Show as a manager?

		ANNIE
	You'd be great, just great...
		(rattling quickly)
	'Cause you understand non-linear
	thinking even though it seems
	like baseball is a linear game
	'cause of the lines and the box
	scores an'  all--but the fact is
	that there's a spacious-"non-time
	kind of time" to it...

		CRASH
		(interrupting)
	Annie---

		ANNIE
	What?

		CRASH
	I got a lotta time to hear your
	theories and I wanta hear every
	damn one of 'em...but right now
	I'm tired and I don't wanta think
	about baseball and I don't wanta
	think about Quantum Physics...  I
	don't wanta think about nothing...
		(beat)
	I just wanta be.

		ANNIE
	I can do that, too.

He rises, takes her hand, and they head inside.

And as the rains fall on Durham...

						     CUT TO:

INT.  ANNIE'S HOUSE -- DAY

THE SHRINE GLOWS -- Candles everywhere.  Rain pours down on
the windows outside.  And...

ANNIE AND CRASH SIT ON THE COUCH together, in silence.

		ANNIE
	Walt Whitman once said--"I see
	great things in baseball.  It's
	our game--the American game
		(beat)
	He said "it will repair our losses
	and be a blessing to us"...
		(beat)
	You could look it up....

The music--Dave Frishberg sings "Van Lingle Mungo".
