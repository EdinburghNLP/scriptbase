<b>                         CHERRY FALLS
</b><b>                   SCREENPLAY BY KEN SELDEN
</b><b>                         FIRST DRAFT
</b>




<b>FEBRUARY 14, 1998
</b>
<b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>EXT.  TOWN - NIGHT
</b>
The hanging sign says 'Entering Cherry Falls, Ohio'

We see Cherry Falls - A small town in rural Northeastern Ohio. This is 
Norman Rockwell land, red barns on dirt roads, a square in the center of 
town. But things are hidden here. The barns are locked, the shades are 
drawn.

Dissolve to:

<b>EXT.  LOVER'S LANE 
</b>
A romantic turn-off used exclusively for parking. A river gushes by. 
Crickets chirp. The trees blow in the autumn wind. A single car sits on 
the lonely road. The muffled sound of a young couple making out drifts 
through the streamed up windows.

<b>INT.  CAR
</b>
A teenage boy's hand is under a teenage girl's shirt, gently massaging her 
breast. He pulls his hand out from under her shirt and places it on her 
bare knee.

As he starts to slide his hand up her leg, she grabs his hand and gently 
pulls it away. She places it back on her breast, sliding it under her 
shirt.

We pull back. STACY and ROD, two healthy sixteen year olds, are 
passionately making out in the proverbial back seat of a big American car.

Rod smiles seductively, kisses Stacy, and places his hand back on her 
knee. Once again, she stops him, this time just squeezing his hand 
tightly.

<b>                   STACY
</b>               No.

He doesn't give up easy. He playfully wrestles his hand free and slides it 
under her skirt. She grabs his hand again.

<b>                   STACY
</b>               I said no.

<b>                   ROD
</b>               But you don't really
               mean it.

He struggles to free his hand.

<b>                   STACY
</b>               Yes I do. Keep it in your
               pants Rod.

He gives up, aggravated.

<b>                   ROD
</b>               Maybe it won't stay in.
<b>               
</b><b>                   STACY
</b>               Maybe you better just
               drive me home.

He starts the car, glares at her for a second, then turns it off.

<b>                   ROD
</b>               Let me just ask you a serious
               question first.

<b>                   STACY
</b>               What?

<b>                   ROD
</b>               Aren't you worried you
               could die a virgin?

<b>                   STACY
</b>                 (sarcastically)
                Yeah. I'm extremely worried
               about that. It's right up
               there with global warming.

<b>                   ROD
</b>               On our way home, a drunken
               driver could hit us head on
               and send us flying through
               the windshield. Terminate
               us instantly. We'd never 
               experience what it means to
               make love.

<b>                  STACY
</b>               If sheep don't count.

<b>                  ROD
</b>               That wasn't me ...

<b>                  STACY
</b>               I know. I'm kidding you.
               Chill out.

<b>                  ROD
</b>               Well I'm trying to be real
               here and you're mocking me.

<b>                  STACY
</b>               (softening)
              I'm sorry, but you're not
              going to die a virgin Rod.

<b>EXT.  LOVER'S LANE
</b>
There is another car around the bend, hidden from sight. It's an old beat 
up Imperial from the late sixties. Someone is watching them. It's probably 
a psychopath.

<b>INT.  ROD'S CAR
</b>
Rod leans in and starts kissing Stacy again.

                   ROD(cont.)
               I don't wanna take that chance.
               I want my first time to be with you.

She kisses him back. He slides his hand under her skirt again.

<b>                   STACY
</b>               Stop it.

He doesn't.
<b>                   STACY
</b>               Rod!

<b>                   ROD
</b>                (exasperated)
               You're being unfair.

<b>                   STACY
</b>               Unfair?!

<b>                   ROD
</b>               Yes. Unfair to me.

He begins to overpower her. This is quickly turning into date rape. SHE 
STARTS TO FIGHT BACK BUT HE DOESN'T STOP. FINALLY, SHE SCRATCHES him 
savagely across the face. This catches his attention. He jumps back, cut 
slightly, surprised.

She opens the car door and quickly escapes.

<b>EXT.  ROAD
</b>
She runs away from the car, down the road, very upset.

<b>INT.  CAR
</b>
Rod catches himself. He looks at his bloodied face in the rear view mirror 
and realizes what he's done.

He starts up the car.

<b>EXT.  ROAD
</b>
Stacy runs down the road alone, still very upset.

<b>INT.  CAR
</b>
Rod pulls up next to her and rolls down his window.

<b>                  ROD
</b>              Stacy! I'm sorry.

<b>EXT.  ROAD
</b>
She pays no attention to him.

<b>                  ROD
</b>              Please get back in the car, Stacy.

She turns and heads down a path into the dark woods, purposely going where 
he can't follow.

<b>INT.  CAR
</b>
Rod, frustrated, hits the steering wheel and floors it.

<b>EXT.  ROAD
</b>
As Rod's car tears off, down the road, the other car that was parked at 
lover's lane drives up and pulls over, lights still off.

<b>EXT. WOODS
</b>
Stacy heads deeper into the woods. When she finally stops to catch her 
breath and wipe away her tears, she hears someone approaching her. 
Suddenly, the footsteps stop. Stacy senses that someone is watching her.

<b>                  STACY
</b>                Rod?

No answer.

<b>                 STACY
</b>               Is that you Rod?

Still no answer. A little frightened, she starts to walk again.  Again she 
hears the footsteps following her. She stops again. Whoever is out there 
stops too. She looks around in every direction.

<b>                 STACY
</b>               Come out Rod.
               This SCREAM bull shit ain't
               gonna work with me!

No answer. Even the birds have stopped chirping.

<b>                 STACY
</b>                (terrified)
              Rod? You're freaking me
              out. Game's over. I lose.
              Come out and we'll fuck.

She hears the footsteps behind her and quickly turns around. She sees the 
silhouette of someone standing a few feet away.

The wind picks up. Stacy realizes it isn't Rod. All she can see is that 
whoever is there is carrying a small sledge hammer in one hand and a very 
long, jagged, steel nail in the other.

<b>                  STACY
</b>               (in full panic)
<b>              NO!
</b>
Stacy starts to run. The killer starts after her.

<b>EXT.  STACY'S
</b>
Rod is sitting in his car in front of Stacy's house at the edge of the 
woods, waiting for her to appear. He checks his watch.

<b>EXT.  WOODS
</b>
Stacy runs for the edge of the woods but she isn't quite fast enough to 
elude her pursuer.

<b>                  STACY
</b>              Help!

The killer catches Stacy from behind and savagely smashes her head against 
a tree, cracking a branch. Stacy falls to the ground, dazed.

<b>INT.  CAR
</b>
Rod sits up in his seat, thinking he's heard something

<b>EXT.  WOODS
</b>
Stacy, half conscious, bleeding from the head, is dragged back deeper into 
the woods.

<b>EXT.  STACY'S
</b>
Rod gets out of the car and cautiously moves to the edge of the dark 
woods.

<b>EXT.  WOODS
</b>
Rod's POV - The woods are pitch black.

<b>                   ROD
</b>              Stacy?

<b>                  STACY(O.C.)
</b>            (struggling, in the distance)
<b>            ROD!
</b>
<b>EXT.  WOODS
</b>
The killer kicks Stacy in the side, instantly shutting her up. He gags her 
and ties her to a tree trunk. She struggles, but she's no match for the 
killer.

<b>INT.  CAR
</b>
Rod grabs his flashlight from the glove compartment.

<b>EXT.  WOODS
</b>
Rod's flashlight beam frantically cuts through the woods.

Rod charges through the woods, desperately looking for any sign of Stacy.

<b>EXT.  WOODS
</b>
Stacy's right hand is raised above her head and placed, palm out, against 
a tree trunk.

<b>EXT.  WOODS
</b>
Rod searches for Stacy, his flashlight jaggedly cutting the darkness.

<b>EXT.  WOODS
</b>
The huge nail, extremely sharp and jagged, is placed in the center of 
Stacy's outstretched palm.

The hammer is pulled back, aimed at the head of the nail.

<b>EXT. WOODS
</b>
Rod stops and frantically looks around, knowing he's fighting a losing 
battle.

<b>                  ROD
</b>             Stacy?!

<b>EXT.  WOODS
</b>
The hammer descends on the nail.

Stacy screams out in pain, even through the gag, as he hand is nailed to 
the tree.

<b>EXT.  WOODS
</b>
Rod hears her muffled cry and runs toward the sound.

Stacy's left hand is now placed up against a different tree.

Another nail is readied.

Stacy tries to free her nailed hand but it's useless. She goes into shock.

Rod's flashlight continues to cut through the night. His feet trample 
fallen branches. Suddenly, he stops. He's found her.

Stacy is stretched out between two trees, gagged, one hand nailed to each 
tree. She almost looks crucified.

Rod, starts toward her, not sure what to do. He looks into Stacy's 
terrified eyes. She's looking behind him.

Rod quickly turns around but he's too late.

A knife comes plunging down toward Rod's chest.

Stacy frantically tries to free herself but she only succeeds in ripping 
her palms on the nails.

Rod falls to his knees, blood streaming from his chest and mouth.

Stacy can't even react anymore, she's so horrified.

The killer's hand rips open Stacy's shirt and feels her soft ripe stomach.

Stacy looks down, terrified of what the killer has planned.

A small but extremely sharp razor attached to the end of a pencil is 
placed up against Stacy's bare stomach. The killer's hand grips it like 
it's an ordinary pencil.

Stacy's eyes grow abnormally wide as the carving starts. She's never 
experienced such pain.

Blood drips to the ground.

Dissolve to:

<b>EXT.  NIGHT SKY
</b>
The full moon looks down on the town.

<b>EXT.  CUL DE SAC
</b>
Another romantic turn off. A view from the top of a hill overlooking the 
sleepy town. A lonely car sits there, the sound of a teenage couple making 
out drifting through it's steamed up windows. It's almost a repeat of the 
first scene.

<b>INT.  CAR
</b>
The boy pulls his hand from under the girl's shirt and unsnaps her jeans. 
She pushes his hand away but he puts it right back, wriggling a finger 
down into her pants.

JODY MARKEN, a pretty all-American sixteen year old girl, strong willed 
but still innocent, stops kissing her boyfriend KENNY, trying to hold him 
off. Kenny is also sixteen. He's thin and a bit shaggy, but very cute 
nonetheless. His hair is shoulder length, his stare intense. He takes 
himself seriously, all rebel.

<b>                  JODY
</b>              Cut it out.

<b>                  KENNY
</b>              Why?

<b>                  JODY
</b>              I was supposed to be home
              fifteen minutes ago.

<b>                  KENNY
</b>              So? You're already late.
              A few more minutes won't
              matter.

He slides a second finger into her pants. She closes her legs, making his 
probing much more difficult.

<b>                  JODY
</b>              I got to get home.

<b>                  KENNY
</b>              Fuck your curfew. Most
              sixth graders can stay out
              later than you.

He starts kissing her again.

<b>                  JODY
</b>              Kenny....

She pulls his hand out of her pants. He stares at her for a second, 
completely exasperated. He sits up and starts the car.

<b>EXT.   CUL DE SAC
</b>
The car squeals away.

<b>INT.   CAR
</b>
Jody and Kenny drive home, not talking.

He pulls up in front of her house.

<b>                  KENNY          
</b>            You know, maybe we ought to
            start seeing other people.

<b>                  JODY
</b>            What?

<b>                  KENNY
</b>            Jody, we've been going out
            for over a year. I love you
            but I'm all out of patience.

Jody doesn't know what to say. She didn't expect this.

<b>EXT.  MARKEN HOUSE
</b>
Jody gets out of the car, very upset. Kenny takes off, not even waiting to 
see if she gets inside safely, leaving her all alone on the dark street. A 
car backfires in the distance. A nearby noise  startles her. Something's 
behind the garbage cans. She heads quickly up the driveway, disappearing 
behind the house.

<b>INT.  MARKEN'S HOUSE - BACK FOYER
</b>
All is quiet in the house. The back door opens. Jody tiptoes up back 
staircase.

<b>INT.  MARKEN'S HOUSE
</b>
Jody appears on the second floor. It's a family house, politely decorated 
and immaculately clean. She quietly creeps down the hallway toward her 
room. As she passes her parents' room, she looks down. She's relieved that 
no light is coming from under their door.

<b>INT.  JODY'S BEDROOM 
</b>
Jody creeps into her bedroom and quietly shuts the door. She's made it. 
She sits on the bed to catch her breath.

Something moves in the corner of her room. Jody jumps, scared.
Someone is sitting in her rocking chair.

<b>                 BRENT
</b>            It's almost ten o'clock.

<b>                 JODY
</b>            Daddy you scared me!

<b>                 BRENT
</b>            You're grounded Friday night!

<b>                 JODY
</b>            What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST
<b>            LOST TRACK OF TIME.
</b>
BRENT MARKEN gets up and heads to the door. He's a big man, 45 years old, 
well built. He's dressed in a  tree-shirt and jeans.

<b>                 BRENT
</b>            Your curfew is 9:30 and you
            know it, little miss.

<b>                 JODY
</b>            It won't happen again.

<b>                 BRENT
</b>            You said that two weeks ago.

<b>                 JODY
</b>           Dad ! Most of my friends can
           stay out until 11 on school nights
           and 1 on weekends!

<b>                 BRENT
</b>           They're not all the sheriff's daughter.
           Goodnight.

He leaves. Jody is furious. She lies down on the bed to stew. She might at 
well have stayed out. The phone in the hallway rings. She leaps up.

<b>INT.  HALLWAY
</b>
Jody runs up to the phone but waits for it to ring a second time before 
picking it up. She crosses her fingers, praying it's Kenny.

<b>                 JODY
</b>            Hello. (beat) One second.
                (to her dad)
            Hey Adolph, it's the station!

Brent comes out and picks up the phone as Jody heads back to her room, 
disappointed.

<b>INT.  BEDROOM
</b>
Jody flops on the bed.

<b>                 BRENT(O.C.)
</b>            Hello. (beat) What?

<b>INT.  HALLWAY
</b>
Brent it shocked.

<b>                 BRENT
</b>            Where?

MARGE MARKEN, Jody's mother, comes out of the bedroom, sensing something 
terrible has happened. Marge is a couple of years older than Brent. She's 
a bit lifeless, a pretty woman who's whole life is her daughter and a 
bottle of Peachtree Schnapps.

<b>                 BRENT(CONT'D)
</b>            I'm on my way.

<b>INT.  JODY'S
</b>
Jody sits up on her bed, also sensing something big has happened.

<b>INT.  HALLWAY
</b>
Brent buttons up his shirt.

<b>                  MARGE
</b>            What happened?

<b>                  BRENT
</b>            Two kids were found mutilated
            in the woods. Lock the door
            after me.

Brent grabs his gun belt and heads down the stairs.

Jody appears. She and her mom share a concerned glance.

<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. STACY'S HOUSE
</b>
Brent pulls up. A lot of official cars are already there.

<b>EXT. WOODS
</b>
A trail of flares eerily light up the woods, leading to the crime scene.

<b>EXT.  WOODS
</b>
The murder sit. Police cameras flash. Stacy is still nailed to the tree. 
Rod is dead on the ground below her in a puddle of his own blood.

Brent walks up, immediately repulsed by the gruesome sight. His deputy, 
JACK WEBBER, sidles up next to him.

<b>                  DEPUTY
</b>           Her parents reported her missing about
           an hour ago.

A flash bulb momentarily lights up the scene. Brent pulls out his 
flashlight to better survey the carnage.

He starts on Rod, throat slit, chest gutted. He then moves to Stacy, 
looking at one nailed hand, then the other.

<b>                  BRENT
</b>           What kind of a person wakes
           up in the morning and says
           to themselves, 'Think I'll nail
           a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'?

<b>                  DEPUTY
</b>           The same type that decides to carve into
           her stomach.

Brent finally shines the flashlight beam on Stacy's stomach. Carved into 
her flesh is the word 'VIRGIN'.

<b>MONTAGE
</b>
High school kids are getting ready for school.

Body parts are being covered. Pants and stocking are pulled up over bare 
teenage legs.

Shirts and bras cover bare teenage chests.

Zippers are pulled tight. Buttons are buttoned.

The school bell rings and the kids arrive in cars, on bikes, walking.

IT'S A TYPICAL small town American high school, somewhat repressed but 
alive. The news spreads quickly about the double killing as the crowd 
splits into its various tribes: punk rockers, jocks, potheads, 
cheerleaders, nerds.

The killing is on everyone's mind.

<b>EXT.  SCHOOLYARD
</b>
Jody rides up on her bike and glances across the schoolyard as she locks 
it in the bike rack.

Jody's POV - Kenny is leaning against a tree, talking with a busty girl, 
<b>SHARON.
</b>
Jody is upset to see Kenny flirting with someone else. As she starts 
toward the front door of the school, a few other CLASSMATES run up to her. 
She keeps glancing over at Kenny but he doesn't notice her.

<b>                  CLASSMATE 1
</b>                Jody!

<b>                  JODY
</b>                Hi.

<b>                  CLASSMATE 2
</b>                 Was Stacy raped?

<b>                  JODY
</b>                I dunno. My dad never came home
                last night.

Jody's POV - Kenny takes Sharon's hand for a second.

<b>                  CLASSMATE 1(O.C.)
</b>                I bet she was. I heard someone
               stuffed a tent spike up her ass.

<b>                  CLASSMATE 2(O.C.)
</b>                Gives new meaning to the idea
                 of getting 'nailed'.

<b>                  CLASSMATE 1(O.C.)
</b>                Ha-ha. So funny. Sickfuck.

Jody doesn't respond. She stares at Kenny.

Jody's POV - Kenny walks into school with Sharon.

<b>INT.  HOMEROOM
</b>
Jody enters her homeroom, still upset.

Her teacher LEONARD MARLISTON is lecturing the class. Leonard is twenty-
five and quite hip looking for a teacher. He has long somewhat stringy 
brown hair. He is a bit thin and is dressed casually, almost in hippy 
attire. He wears wire-rim glasses and lace-up boots.

<b>                    MR. MARLISTON
</b>             No one understands what leads people
             to do irrational things. We only
             know that unpunished violence
             festers, then explodes.

Jody sits down in the back.

<b>                      MARLISTON(CONT'D)

<b>                     MR. MARLISTON
</b>             Your dad's in the principal's office.
             He wants to see you.

<b>INT.  HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE
</b>
Brent is talking to TOM SISLER, the principal. Tom is a wiry, hard 
featured man in his mid-forties. They have known each other for a long 
time but are not really friends. Brent knows Tom too well. Tom's a cynical 
bastard.

Tom is examining the photos taken at the crime scene.

<b>                     TOM
</b>              You aren't planning to tell these kids
              that 'virgin' was tattooed into both Stacy
              and Rod, are you?

<b>                    BRENT
</b>              No.

<b>                    TOM
</b>              Good.

<b>                    BRENT
</b>              But I am going to have to question
              all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.

<b>                    TOM
</b>              Fine, just don't mention the carving
              This is going to be a tough enough day
              as it is.

There's a knock at the door. Jody enters.

<b>                    BRENT
</b>              Hi honey.

<b>                    JODY
</b>              Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.

<b>                    TOM
</b>              Hi Jody.

<b>                    BRENT
</b>              I just wanted to check that
              you were okay?

<b>                   JODY
</b>              I'm fine. I've just never had
              someone my age die before.
              It's so weird.

<b>                   BRENT
</b>              How well did you know Stacy and
              Rod?

<b>                   JODY
</b>              I've been in the same class
              with Stacy for years but we
              weren't tight or anything.

<b>                   BRENT
</b>              Had either of them broken
              up with someone recently?
              Hurt someone?

<b>                   JODY
</b>              No. Those two were together
              before Kenny and I started
              hanging out and that's over,
              what, God a year now.

<b>                   BRENT
</b>              I want you to head right home
              after school.

<b>                   JODY
</b>              I will. Is that all?

<b>                   TOM
</b>              Could you tell Mr. Marliston

<b>                   JODY
</b><b>              SURE.

She leaves.

<b>                   BRENT
</b>              Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?

<b>                   TOM
</b>              The kids adore him. They confide
              in him. His patchouli reeking rear
              might know if Stacy and Rod were
              really virgins. Why didn't you
              ask Jody that?

<b>                   BRENT
</b>              She's my daughter, Tom.

<b>                   TOM
</b>              So?

<b>                   BRENT
</b>              So you just don't point
              blank ask your teenage daughter
              about sex.

<b>                   TOM
</b>              Why not? You worried you might
              find out how much she actually
              knows?

Brent gives Tom a 'keep your cynical shit off my daughter' look.

<b>                   LEONARD
</b>              You rang?

<b>                   TOM

              met Brent Marken?

<b>                   LEONARD
</b>              No but I've always wanted to.

He shakes his hand firmly.

<b>                   BRENT
</b>              Nice to meet you too. My
              daughter speaks highly of you.

Leonard examines Brent's face carefully. Brent is a little taken aback by 
his intensity.

<b>                   LEONARD
</b>              We have the same color eyes.

<b>                   BRENT
</b>              I guess we do.

<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. CAFTERIA
</b>
MARK SHALE, a seventeen year old, rail thin pothead is sitting at a table 
in the crowded cafeteria eating lunch. The place is a zoo. CINDY, a cute, 
mini-skirted brunette, and BEN,  a frizzy-haired, tattooed, pierced, punk-
rocker, are sitting with him.

Jody is standing at the door with her best friend SANDY, looking for a 
place to sit. Sandy is thin and a little underdeveloped for her age. She 
is wearing very little make-up, a baggy shirt and baggy jeans. Although 
she looks much more tomboyish than Jody and a year or two younger, she is 
still quite cute and curvy, just lacking a  bit in self-confidence when it 
comes to boys. Sandy is staring at Mark.

<b>                   JODY
</b>             Go sit next to him.

<b>                   SANDY
</b>             Who?

<b>                   JODY
</b>             Mark Shale.

<b>                   SANDY
</b>             Why?

<b>                   JODY
</b>             Don't you want to talk to him?
             You watch him eat everyday.

<b>                   SANDY
</b>             I don't watch him eat everyday.

<b>                   JODY
</b>             You stare at him non-stop,
             like every lunch. Like this. Like
             most people stare at car accidents.

Jody imitates Sandy.

<b>                   SANDY
</b>             The seat behind him is open. Come on,
             I can eavesdrop too.

<b>                   JODY
</b>             You eventually have to talk to him.

<b>                   SANDY
</b>             Why? All my mom and dad ever do is
             watch each other eat and they've been
             married for twenty years.

Cindy sees Jody approaching and motions her over.

<b>                   CINDY
</b>             Jody!

Jody starts toward her table.

<b>                   SANDY
</b>              No! That's his table.

<b>                   JODY
</b>              You're going to look really
              amoebic splitting off from me now.

The other three kids look up as Jody sits don.

Sandy has no choice but to sit down next to Mark. She immediately freezes 
up.

<b>                   CINDY
</b>              Did your dad question you
              this morning?

<b>                   JODY
</b>              Just a little.

<b>                   BEN
</b>              Did he ask you if Stacy
              and Rod has ever exchanged
              bodily fluids?

<b>                   JODY
</b>              No. Why?

<b>                   CINDY
</b>              He asked Marliston.

<b>                   JODY
</b>              If they had ever gone all the way?

<b>                   BEN
</b>              Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED
<b>              OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.
</b>
<b>                  CINDY
</b>              I wonder why it's so important
              to know if they fucked?

Sandy is completely frozen. Jody realizes it. Mark is paying no attention 
to her.

<b>                   BEN
</b>              What I don't understand is
              why they asked Marliston if
              Rod was a virgin. They could have
              asked you Cindy.

<b>                  CINDY
</b>              I never fucked Rod.

<b>                  BEN
</b>              Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.

Jody nudges Sandy under the table, trying to prompt her to say something. 
Sandy can only stare at Mark as he eats.

<b>                   CINDY(O.C.)
</b>              If I'm so all-used-up Ben,
              why do you try to hook me
              up non-stop?

<b>                  BEN(O.C.)
</b>              As fucking if.

Across the cafeteria, a sophomore ANNETTE storms in very upset. She 
confronts DYLAN, her junior boyfriend.

<b>                  ANNETTE
</b>              You're a shitsucking liar!

<b>                  DYLAN

              liar!

<b>                  ANNETTE
</b>              Shut your face!

Annette leaps on Dylan and starts violently scratching him. Mr. Marliston 
runs over and pulls her off. He drags Annette away.

<b>                  ANNETTE
</b>               He's been telling people....

<b>                   LEONARD

              my office. Calm down. We're all
              on edge today.

He guides her out.

Sandy gets up her nerve and makes eye contact with Mark.

<b>                   SANDY
</b>               What's up with that?

Mark opens a TWINKIE and starts to eat it.

               that Annette gave him a blow
               job.

<b>                   SANDY
</b>               And she didn't?

Ben and Mark laugh.

<b>                   BEN
</b>                There's a better chance that he
                got head from all five Spice Girls.

<b>                  SANDY
</b>                That's horrible.

Cindy laughs at Sandy. Sandy doesn't appreciate being laughed at.

<b>                  CINDY
</b>                I think it's funny.

<b>                  BEN
</b>               Me too. I'm going to start
               telling people that I saw her drop
                to her knees and latch on to his
                unit vector.

Cindy laughs. The first meeting hasn't gone well for Sandy. Jody feels for 
her and jumps to her rescue.

<b>                   JODY
</b>                You wouldn't?

<b>                  BEN
</b>                I would if Dylan paid me.

<b>INT.  SCHOOL
</b>
The bell rings. It's the end of the day.

</b>
All the kids charge out. Jody walks out with Sandy.

<b>                  SANDY
</b>               (flustered)
              What am I supposed to say?
              'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you
              buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'

<b>                  JODY
</b>                (teasing a bit)
              You could tell him you really
              liked the way he chews with his
              back molars.

<b>                 SANDY
</b>              You're so fucking lucky your
              dad is the sheriff.

<b>                 JODY
</b>              You are 'sp fucking' wrong.

<b>                 SANDY
</b>              You get to be a little Chelsea
              Clinton. Everyone wants to meet
              you. Party with you. Have sex with you.

<b>                 JODY
</b>              But you can't do any of it.
              So it sucks. I always have to
              'set an example'.

Jody stops, noticing something.

<b>EXT.  PARKING LOT
</b>
Jody's POV - Kenny is walking to his car with Sharon.

Sandy sees how upset Jody is.

<b>                  SANDY
</b>               He's just trying to mess
               with your head. Ignore
               him.

<b>                   JODY
</b>               Does she fuck?

<b>                  SANDY
</b>               (trying to comfort)
               I doubt it. Who'd want
               to fuck her. She probably
               reeks worse than the docks
               down in those panties.

Jody is slowly pedaling her bicycle next to Sandy.

<b>                   JODY
</b>                (frustrated)
              Mr. Jenkins called on me in
              class today. It was so embarrassing.
              I was seriously spaced. I'd been thinking
              about Kenny for over twenty minutes.
              When I snapped out of it, I looked pathetic.
              I was teared up. Everyone was staring at me.

<b>                  STACY
</b>             What did you say?

<b>                  JODY
</b>             That I was sorry. I'd drifted off.
             That I'd been thinking about Stacy
             and Rod.

<b>                  SANDY
</b>             Oh nice save.

<b>                  JODY
</b>             I was desperate. It was gross.

<b>                  SANDY
</b>             Kenny'll come running back.
             This is just his way of pressuring
             you.

<b>                  JODY
</b>             He says he loves me.

<b>                  SANDY
</b>             Personally I think he has a deep,
             almost pathological desire to corrupt
             you. But I suppose that's a type of love.
             I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.

<b>                  JODY
</b>                 (musing)
            Maybe I should blister through a bottle of
            Tequila and just fuck his brains out.

<b>                  SANDY
</b>            No!

<b>                  JODY
</b>            You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.

<b>                  SANDY
</b>            That was before he pulled this 'Dick me
            or I dump you' shit. I say fuck his best
            friend.

Jody laughs.

<b>                  JODY
</b>            I don't know what I'm so scared of.

<b>                  SANDY
</b>            Want to come in for awhile?
            Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men,
            head into a private S&amp;M chat room . . .

<b>                  JODY
</b>            How do you know what to type back when
            they start to cyber with you.

<b>                  SANDY
</b>            I keep a couple of my dad's porno books
            hidden in my desk for emergency reference.

Jody laughs.

<b>                  JODY
</b>            I promised I'd go right home after school.

<b>                  SANDY
</b>            OK. increase the peace.

Sandy hip-hops up her driveway and into her house. Jody jumps on her bike 
and pedals off down the street.

Dissolve to:

<b>EXT. CHERRY FALLS - NIGHT
</b>
Night has set again on the town. An OWL HOOTS. THE STREETS ARE QUIET.

<b>EXT.  STREET
</b>
The killer's car, the black IMPERIAL, lurks in the shadows of a suburban 
street. The killer is staking out a specific house.

<b>EXT.  ANNETTE'S HOUSE
</b>
Annette, the girl who flipped out in the cafeteria appears at the front 
door. Her MOTHER and FATHER are going out.

They kiss ANNETTE goodbye, get in their car and drive away. Annette heads 
back inside and double locks the door.

Annette's parents pull up in front of a restaurant and head inside.

chain,

Someone is standing there in the shadows.

<b>                  KILLER(O.C.)
</b>              HI. Annette?

It's a WOMAN'S VOICE.

<b>INTERCUT WITH:

Annette has never seen this woman before. WE still don't see the killer's 
face.

</b>            I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's
            aunt. He asked me to come
            talk to you.

<b>                  ANNETTE
</b>            Why?

<b>                  KILLER(O.C.)
</b>            He feels terrible about those things
            he said to you in school.

<b>                 ANNETTE
</b>                 (really angry)
           He should. Four guys hit on me today,
           and not because they find me intellectually
           stimulating.

<b>                 KILLER(O.C.)
</b>           I think I know how to restore your

           You do?

<b>                  KILLER(O.C.)
</b>           Can I come in? I'll need to use the
           phone.

Annette isn't sure what to do but this is too important to pass up.

<b>                  ANNETTE
</b>            Sure.

Annette unlocks the chain. The killer heads inside.

THE DOOR OMINOUSLY closes behind them.

<b>INT.  RESTAURANT
</b>
Wine is being poured into already half-filled glasses.

Annette's parents and the other couple are now a little tipsy, much looser 
than when we saw them earlier. They are laughing, rubbing each other, 
getting physical.

The other HUSBAND leans in and kisses Annette's' mother on the nose. 
Annette's father is at first taken aback but then he responds by kissing 
the other WIFE on the ear. They all laugh. It's getting fancy for Cherry 
Falls.

<b>INT.  HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY
</b>
ANNETTE comes charging down the hallway, groggy, bleeding profusely from 
the side of her head, terrified.

<b>                  ANNETTE
</b>               Help!

<b>INT.  RESTAURANT
</b>
More wine is poured. The two couples eye each other, giggling.

<b>INT.  BEDROOM
</b>
Annette charges into her bedroom and slams the door behind her, locking 
it. She quickly pulls her dresser in front of the door.

The door handle moves. The killer is on the other side.

Annette picks up the telephone. it's dead.

The killer kicks the door a couple of times.

Annette backs away from the door, all the way to the window. She grabs a 
sharp pen, holding it like it's a knife. The kicking stops, All is 
momentarily quiet.

Suddenly the killer's shadow appears in the window behind Annette. The 
window smashes an d Annette's neck is pulled towards the shards of glass 
that remain in the broken window.

Annette struggles but she's not strong enough.

<b>INT.  RESTAURANT
</b>
Under the table, the other man puts his hand on Annette's mom's knee.
Annette's mom smiles at the man, drunk and interested.

<b>INT.  HOUSE

The killer lowers Annette's throat closer to the shard of glass.

<b>INT.  RESTAURANT

Annette's mom pushes the man's hand under her dress.

<b>INT.  HOUSE

Annette's throat touches the glass. She's all but lost.

<b>INT.  RESTAURANT

Annette's mom lets out a huge  laugh, knocking over her red win, soaking 
the white tablecloth in red.

<b>INT.  HOUSE

Annette's eyes roll up into her head.

Annette, half alive is dragged out the window.

Out come the hammer and nails.

Annette's parents come inside.

<b>                  MOTHER
</b>            Annette. We're home.

She notices a red spot on the carpet and leans over to inspect it.

<b>INT.  HALLWAY
</b>
Annette's mom starts down the hallway, noticing the trail of blood leading 
to Annette's door, realizing something is wrong.

<b>                   MOTHER
</b>               (concerned)
             Annette?

She tugs at Annette's door.

Her mother frantically tugs at the door. Her dad appears.

<b>                   MOTHER
</b>             Annette!!

Her dad lifts his foot and starts kicking at the door.

It begins to splinter.

<b>INT.  BEDROOM
</b>
They break through. Annette's dad pushes the dresser out of the way and 
they barge in.

The room seems to be empty except the window has been broken and blood's 
splattered around it.

<b>                   MOTHER
</b>             Annette?

She notices the shade to the other window has been drawn and is flapping 
oddly, caught on something.

She walks over, frightened, gathers her nerve, then pulls the shade up.

Annette has been nailed to the outside of the house, her dead eyes looking 
in.

'VIRGIN' is carved deeply in her forehead.

Her mother screams.

He's really worried, He's figured out that his town is under siege.

<b>                  MARGE

Brent darts up the stairs.

<b>INT.  JODY'S BEDROOM 
</b>
Jody is in bed. There's a soft knock on the door. She rolls over.

<b>                  JODY

Brent walks in and seats himself on the edge of the bed.

<b>                  BRENT
</b>             Hi honey.

<b>                 JODY

<b>                  BRENT
</b>             I have a question to ask you.
             A personal question.

Jody sits up, pulling the covers up over her breasts.

<b>                 JODY
</b>               (uncomfortable)
             How personal?

Brent takes a deep breath. He's really uncomfortable.

<b>                  BRENT
</b>             I need to know how far you
             and Kenny went?

Jody is really uncomfortable with this question.

<b>                 BRENT

Brent comes down the stairs.

<b>EXT.  CHERRY FALLS

It's a new day. As the kids arrive at school, rumors are flying. Everyone 
is a little more on edge. The same tribes exist but kids are starting to 
glance and listen to kids from other tribes. The social structure is 
starting to fray.

<b>INT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

Brent is upset, confused.

<b>                   BRENT
</b>              If I'd gone public with this
              yesterday Annette Michaels might

</b>              is there anything you do?

<b>                    TOM
</b>             Focus on the present. You always
             want to change the past. Let's figure
             out what you are going to tell the parents
             today, not what you should told them
             yesterday.

<b>                   BRENT
</b>             I'm going to tell them everything I know.
             I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.

<b>                   TOM
</b>             You tell these people someone is out there
             killing virgins and we're going to have a     
             goddamn fuckfest on our hands.

<b>                  BRENT
</b>             Better than a pile of dead teenagers.

<b>EXT.  TOWN HALL
</b>
The town bell rings in the steeple. It's eight o'clock.

<b>EXT.  MAIN STREET
</b>
The shops close down. All the townsfolk head toward the assembly hall.

<b>EXT.  SCHOOL
</b>
The parents arrive. They are all concerned. They've all heard rumors by 
now. They hurry into the school, whispering to one another.

<b>INT.  AUDITORIUM
</b>
The parents are seated, whispering, buzzing. Brent walks up to the podium. 
He's very nervous as he looks out at the crowd, realizing he's going to 
really, really upset them. He takes a deep breath.

<b>                  BRENT
</b>            I think you all know why I CALLED THIS
            Town meeting. In the last two days, three
            of our children have been murdered and it
            appears that we have now established a common
            link between the killings.

The crowd grows still. Everyone is interested in this information.
Brent pauses.

<b>                   FATHER 1

<b>                   BRENT
</b>             All three of the victims attended our
             public high school and all three were or appear
             to have been...um...virgins.

There is a ripple of confusion that runs through the auditorium.

<b>                   MOTHER 1

<b>                   MOTHER 2

             You're almost positive that's
             who this monster is targeting?

<b>                   MOTHER 1
</b>             Virgins?

<b>                   BRENT

</b>             Why didn't you tell us this yesterday?

<b>                   BRENT
</b>             We didn't think this was a serial killer.
             We thought it was an isolated incident.

This is all very upsetting to everyone.

<b>                   MOTHER 3
</b>             Are you close to an arrest?

<b>                   BRENT
</b>             I can't say we are.

<b>                   FATHER 2
</b>             What are we supposed to do?

<b>                   BRENT
</b>             What do you mean?

<b>                    MOTHER 2
</b>             What are we supposed to tell
             our kids?

<b>                   FATHER 2
</b>             To go out and get laid if they
             wanna feel safe?

<b>                   BRENT
</b>             I think that's' up to each and
             everyone of you.

<b>                   FATHER 3
</b>            I can't lock my daughter in
            the basement.

<b>                   FATHER 2
</b>            I wouldn't worry about it Victor.

A few other parents laugh.

<b>                   FATHER 3
</b>            What's that supposed to mean?

<b>                   FATHER 2
</b>            Nothing.

<b>                   FATHER 3
</b>            What are you saying about my
            daughter?

Father 3 starts towards Father 2. Tempers are short.

<b>                   FATHER 2
</b>               (getting worried)
            Calm down. I was joking.

Father 3 pushes Father 2.

<b>                   FATHER 3
</b>            Hell of a time to be joking about
            a thing like that you sick bastard!

Father 3 swings at him. A fight ensues. Other parents start to jump in. 
Tempers are short. Brent leaps down to break it up.

<b>EXT.  TOWN
</b>
A match lights a long fuse.

Fire crackles along the ground toward a huge string of firecrackers and 
Roman candles. They ignite. The firecrackers explode as balls of fire 
shoot into the night sky. TEENAGERS howl.

<b>INT.  SANDY'S BEDROOM
</b>
Jody is talking on the phone to Sandy. Sandy's room is typical teenage 
room, identical in feel to Jody's.

<b>                    SANDY
</b>               (really worried)
            What are we going to do?

<b>INT.  JODY'S BEDROOM
</b>
Jody is lying on her bed.

<b>                    JODY
</b>            Sandy, you have to chill out,
            at least two-thirds of the kids
            in our class are still virgins.
            He can't butcher all of us.
<b>     
</b><b>                    SANDY
</b>            There will be a lot fewer by
            tomorrow night.

<b>EXT.  HOUSE
</b>
The killer's imperial pulls up across the street from Jody's.

<b>INT.  JODY'S
</b>
<b>                    JODY
</b>            Not that many.

<b>                     SANDY
</b>            You watch. There's going to be
            a hymen holocaust tomorrow.
            Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark
            Shale.

<b>                    JODY
</b><b>            NO?!
</b>
There's a sound on the phone. Sandy's brother ANDY has picked it up.

<b>                   SANDY
</b>            Andy! I'm on the phone!

<b>INT.  DOWNSTAIRS AT SANDY'S
</b>
ANDY, Sandy's thirteen year old brother is on the line.

<b>                   ANDY(ON THE PHONE)
</b>             I just wanted to offer my
             services to Jody.

<b>                   SANDY
</b>             Your services?

<b>                    ANDY
</b>             I'm willing to help save her life.
             Jody, if you want to come over right
             now. We could slip up into the attic for
             a few minutes. There's an old mattress
             up there...

<b>                   SANDY
</b><b>             MOM!
</b>
Andy hangs up laughing.

<b>INT.  JODY'S
</b>
Jody chuckles but all of a sudden the line goes dead.

<b>                   JODY
</b>              Hello?

Jody tries to call back but the phone isn't working. This spooks her. The 
doorbell rings downstairs. Now Jody is more than spooked. She's SCARED. 
She goes to the window to see who it is.

<b>EXT.  HOUSE 
</b>
Someone is standing in the shadows below. All Jody can make out is that 
it's a woman.

<b>INT.  STAIRS
</b>
Jody, dressed only in her nightshirt, cautiously heads downstairs to the 
back door.

<b>INT.  BACK HALLWAY
</b>
JODY looks through the back door window.

<b>EXT.  BACK DOOR
</b>
There's someone in the shadows.

Jody opens the door a crack.

<b>                   JODY
</b>               Yes?

<b>                    KILLER(O.C.)
</b>               Are you Jody?

Once again, a woman's voice.

<b>                    JODY
</b>               Yeah.

<b>                    KILLER(O.C.)
</b>               I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.

<b>                   JODY
</b>               Kenny's aunt?

<b>                  KILLER(O.C.)
</b>               Yes. He asked me to come over
               and talk to you.

Jody senses something is off.

<b>                   JODY
</b>               On what side of the family?

<b>                   KILLER(O.C.)
</b>               His mother's side.

<b>                    JODY
</b>                His mother's an only child.

Jody suddenly gets it and tries to slam the door closed but the killer is 
too fast, sliding a hand and foot in, pushing her way into the house.

Jody fights to push the door shut but she can't. The killer is stronger. 
The killer's hand gropes for the lock latch.

Jody frantically looks around for a weapon and spots an electric 
screwdriver sitting in the back pantry. She grabs for the screwdriver with 
one hand as the killer pushes harder.

Jody drills the killer's elbow.

The killer screams and lets go. Jody slams the door shut, double locking 
it.

<b>INT.  FRONT HALLWAY
</b>
Jody runs to the front hall and double locks the front door.

<b>INT.  LIVING ROOM
</b>
Jody picks up a phone but it's dead downstairs too. She looks around.

<b>EXT.  HOUSE
</b>
She notices a shadow move across the back window. The killer hasn't left. 
The killer seems to be following her.

<b>INT.  FRONT HALL CLOSET
</b>
Jody grabs a baseball bat from the front hall closet. The killer's shadow 
appears outside.

<b>INT.  KITCHEN 
</b>
Jody runs into the kitchen, grabs a knife. The window above her breaks. 
The killer is right outside.

<b>INT.  DINING ROOM
</b>
Jody runs into the dining room, not sure where to go. Suddenly the window 
breaks there. The killer is stalking her from the outside.

<b>INT.  HOUSE - MONTAGE
</b>
THE HOUSE is under siege and Jody is trapped in it. She runs from room to 
room, turning the lights out but windows break wherever she goes. It's 
terrifying.

<b>INT.  FOYER
</b>
Suddenly there is a silence. Jody stops running. She realizes that the 
killer must be climbing in somewhere. Jody isn't sure what to do.

She hears something in the family room.

<b>INT.  FAMILY ROOM
</b>
Jody enters. She sees the killer's shadow cross the window. She runs out.

<b>INT.  HALLWAY
</b>
Jody creeps through the dark house, unsure where to go.

<b>INT.  DEN
</b>
Jody creeps back into the den. The killer doesn't seem to be there either.

The window is broken. The curtains flap in the breeze. She moves toward 
it, wondering whether it's safe to climb out. She looks in the mirror.

In the mirror, Jody can see the killer's shoes peeking out from under the 
drapes. The killer's in the room. The drapes start to move.

Jody turns around and swings the bat, hitting the killer squarely in the 
head, sending her to the ground, pulling the drapes down.

<b>INT.  HOUSE
</b>
Jody tears for the front door.

<b>INT.  FRONT HALL
</b>
Jody's too nervous to unlock the front door.

She hears the killer coming so she tears up the stairs.

<b>INT.  STAIRCASE
</b>
Jody scampers up the staircase but she's not fast enough. The killer grabs 
her leg through the wooden slatted banister starts pulling her off the 
staircase, breaking the wooden slats.

Jody grabs one of the jagged slats and rams the sharp end into the 
killer's hand, freeing herself.

<b>INT.  STAIRS
</b>
Jody charges up the stairs and into the bathroom.

<b>INT.  BATHROOM
</b>
Jody closes the bathroom door and locks it.

The killer starts kicking it in.

<b>INT.  BATHROOM
</b>
Jody opens the small bathroom window to climb out on the roof.

The door starts to splinter.

Jody tries to wriggle her way out but it's tight.

Behind her she hears the door splintering open.

<b>EXT.  ROOF
</b>
Jody squeezes through and grabs hold of the chimney, using it to pull 
herself out.

<b>INT.  BATHROOM
</b>
The killer's hand grabs Jody's leg just as Jody's pulling herself free. 
The killer closes the window on Jody's leg, trapping it inside. Out comes 
the razor.

<b>EXT.  ROOF
</b>
Jody fights for her freedom, tugging at the chimney, kicking and 
screaming: All of a sudden she feels a surge of pain. She screams and 
kicks with all her might, freeing herself, her momentum sending her 
rolling down the roof. She rolls off the roof, barely grabbing hold of the 
gutter, hanging from it.

The gutter starts to break.

Above her she can hear the killer coming out onto the roof.

The killer's silhouette hovers above, ready to grab her.

Jody knows she has no choice.

Jody lets go of the gutter.

<b>EXT. BACKYARD
</b>
Jody falls twenty feet to the ground below.

<b>                  JODY
</b>              Help!

Jody smashes to the ground.

<b>EXT.  NEIGHBOR'S
</b>
A neighbor hears the clatter and comes running out to see what's going on.

<b>EXT.  BACKYARD
</b>
Jody lies still on the ground.

<b>EXT.  ROOF
</b>
The killer, still in silhouette, looks down from the roof.

<b>EXT.  BACKYARD
</b>
Jody's neighbor runs over to help her.

Jody rolls over, still groggy.

Jody looks up to the roof.

<b>EXT.  ROOF
</b>
<b>THE KILLER IS GONE.
</b>
<b>EXT.  BACKYARD
</b>
Jody looks back down at her bloody leg. There is a 'V' carved into it.

<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT.  HOUSE
</b>
Later that night. Police cars are lined up outside the house.

<b>INT.  HOUSE
</b>
Police are scouring the house. Jody is trying to sup some hot chocolate 
but her hands are still shaking.

<b>                JODY
</b>            It was a she.

<b>                 BRENT
</b>            Are you sure?

<b>                JODY
</b>           She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa.

Her mom comes in with a bottle of cognac, ready to pour a little into 
Jody's cup.

<b>                BRENT
</b>           What are you doing?

<b>                 MARGE
</b>           This will relax her.

<b>                 BRENT
</b>           She's underage.

Brent motions towards the cops, his co-workers, who are scurrying around 
the house. Mom gives Brent a dirty look and pours just a spot into Jody's 
glass. Sandy enters. She sees Jody and runs to her.

<b>                SANDY
</b>           Oh my god. ARE YOU OK?

Jody breaks into tears. They hug.

<b>                 JODY
</b>           Someone tried to kill me.

<b>                 SANDY
</b>           The phone just went dead.
           I called the police and ran
           right over as fast as I could.

Sandy is really terrified too.

Dissolve to:

<b>EXT.  CHERRY FALLS
</b>
Another morning in CHERRY FALLS. The town may look peaceful but it isn't.

<b>INT.  SANDY'S BATHROOM
</b>
Sandy is getting dressed in her usual manner but he hand is shaking. She's 
still terrified. She looks at herself in the mirror and decides to make a 
change.

Lipstick goes on. mascara and eyeliner follow.

Sandy examines herself in the mirror. She's all made-up. SHE USUALLY wears 
a tenth as much.

<b>INT.  SANDY'S BEDROOM
</b>
Sandy slides into a slightly provocative dress. She looks much hotter than 
she did when we first met her.

<b>INT.  STAIRCASE
</b>
Sandy starts down the stairs. She stops to check out where her mother is.

<b>INT.  KITCHEN
</b>
SANDY'S MOTHER is making breakfast.

<b>INT.  STAIRCASE
</b>
Sandy hurries downstairs, grabs her coat and heads out the door, hoping 
her mom won't notice how she's dressed.

Her mom hears her and catches a glimpse of her new outfit.

<b>                 MOTHER
</b>            You're wearing a skirt?

Sandy doesn't want to get into it. She charges right out the door.

<b>                 SANDY
</b>            Bye mom.

<b>EXT.  SANDY'S HOUSE
</b>
Sandy goes tearing up the street as her mother opens the door after her.
<b>                 MOTHER
</b><b>            SANDY?!
</b>
No way is Sandy turning around.

<b>EXT.  SCHOOL
</b>
The kids arrive at School. Everyone is freaked. The word spreads fast 
about Jody's attack. Many of the kids, like Sandy, have worn a little 
extra make-up or a little tighter jeans. There's a sexual electricity 
everywhere mixed in with a lot of fear.

The normal tribes are disbanding. What are forming in their place are 
sexual tribes. Today, at the high school, sexual history bands kids 
together. Not aesthetics, popularity, or wealth. Punkers chat with nerds, 
cheerleaders with potheads.

In the parking lot, we see that Aunt Lisa's IMPERIAL is parked. The killer 
is close by.

<b>EXT.  FRONT OF SCHOOL
</b>
Sandy arrives at school. She looks around.

She spots Mark talking with Cindy and BEN. She gathers her confidence up, 
unbuttons her top button to reveal what cleavage she has, and starts 
towards them.

Cindy is laughing at Ben.

<b>                 CINDY
</b>             I'm not fucking you.
             Not for all your CDS.

<b>                  BEN
</b>             You want me to die? I thought
             you and I were tight.

<b>                 CINDY
</b><b>             ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
</b>
<b>                 BEN
</b>             WOULD that impress you?
             IS that what it takes to
             impress the empress?

<b>                 CINDY
</b>             Your mind is just twisted enough.
             I believe you'd do all this just to
             get a dip or two.

Sandy walks up.
<b>                 SANDY
</b>             Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.

<b>                  MARK
</b>             Hi Sandy.

They all stare at her for a second, noticing the change in her appearance.
<b>                 BEN
</b>             Did you want something?

Sandy freezes. She doesn't known what to say.

<b>                  SANDY
</b>               (almost frozen)
            Yes.(beat) I was just curious
            Mark, if you brought a Twinkie
            today?

Ben and Cindy crack up. That was a really lame, stupid question.

<b>                 BEN
</b>              (sarcastically)
            You wonder about that everyday Sandy?

<b>                 MARK
</b>            Shut up Ben.
                 (to sandy)
            Actually, my mom always
            packs two.

<b>                  SANDY
</b>            You got a great mom.
            I'm lucky to get a zucchini
            stick.

<b>                  MARK
</b>            Did you want one?

<b>                  SANDY
</b>             (trying to cover)
            Yeah I was talking about Twinkies
            the other day and I realized I hadn't had one
            in years. Then I remembered seeing you with
            one.

<b>                   MARK
</b>            They're tasty.

He gets out the Twinkie and gives it to her. She unwraps it and takes a 
bite. Ben and Cindy watch, amazed and entertained.

<b>                 SANDY
</b>            Thanks.

Sandy gets  a little cream on her cheek and licks it away with her tongue, 
a little embarrassed. The sight of her tongue turns Mark on.

<b>                 MARK
</b>            You can have both if you want.

<b>                 SANDY
</b>            No, you keep one.

Cindy laughs. The pairing up has started.

<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  POLICE STATION
</b>
Jody is sitting in the police station working with a SKETCH ARTIST.

<b>                  JODY
</b>           A little larger nose.

The artist makes a change.

<b>                 ARTIST
</b>           How's that?

Jody re-examines the picture. She's spooked.

<b>                  JODY
</b>           That's her.

The artist picks up the phone and dials.

<b>                  ARTIST
</b>           Brent, we got a sketch.

Brent comes into the room and picks up the sketch, 

FOR THE FIRST TIME we see a picture of the killer. She looks about 
eighteen years old and has her hair done in an old fashioned wave. She 
looks like your average small town girl from the late sixties.

Brent's face goes white when he sees who it is.

Jody notices this.
<b>               
</b><b>                  JODY
</b>             You know her?

<b>                  BRENT
</b>             It can't be.

<b>                  JODY
</b>             Who is she Daddy?

<b>                  BRENT
</b>             Never mind darling.
             You go back to school.
             I don't want you missing
             anymore classes today.

He picks up the picture and heads quickly into his own office. Jody 
watches through his window, sensing he's very, very upset.

<b>INT.  OFFICE
</b>
Brent picks up the phone and quickly dials a number.

<b>INT.  MAIN ROOM
</b>
Jody has never seen her dad like this. She quietly picks up the phone and 
listens in.

Her dad is talking to the principal, Tom Sisler.

<b>                 BRENT
</b>           IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still
           looks like we're eighteen.

<b>                  TOM
</b>              (on phone)
            That's impossible.

<b>                  BRENT
</b>              (growing frantic)
           I swear to God. It's her.
           She told Jody she was Kenny's
           'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this
           sickly feeling...

<b>                  TOM
</b>           Calm down Brent.

<b>INT.  OFFICE
</b>
Brent looks out and sees that JODY is on the phone, eavesdropping.

<b>                  BRENT
</b>           I'll call you right back.

<b>INT.  MAIN ROOM
</b>
Jody, busted, hangs up.

Brent comes storming out. HER FATHER is livid. SHE'S NEVER SEEN HIM SO 
<b>ANGRY AND UPTIGHT.
</b>
<b>                 BRENT
</b>            You were eavesdropping.

<b>                  JODY
</b>              (a little scared)
            No I wasn't.

<b>                  BRENT
</b>           What did you hear?

<b>                  JODY
</b>           Nothing. I just picked up the phone
           to say goodbye to you. You didn't say
           goodbye.

<b>                  BRENT
</b>           Ok. Goodbye. Now get back to school.

She nods and heads out, freaked. Her father's never treated her this 
harshly before.

<b>EXT.  HIGH SCHOOL
</b>
As Jody approaches the high school, she's still on the edge, given the 
attack of the night before as well as he dad's reaction to the picture. 
She hears a moan coming from behind some bushes. She stops and notices a 
Girl's shoe sticking out from under the bush. Worried it might be someone 
badly hurt, she cautiously starts toward it. Suddenly a couple of more 
feet pop out. Jody jumps back, frightened, but then realizes that it's 
just a  couple of her classmates having sex in the bushes.

Jody heads toward the main school entrance. She starts noticing a lot of 
kids are outside, a few more hidden from sight, having sex. Something's 
up. 

<b>INT.  HIGH SCHOOL
</b>
Jody opens her locker. Sandy comes running up to her, very excited.

<b>                 SANDY
</b>            You ok?

<b>                 JODY
</b>           (noticing Sandy's attire)
           FINE. Are you?

<b>                  SANDY
</b>           Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the
           whole school. Guess what?

<b>                  JODY
</b>           What?

<b>                  SANDY
</b>              (whispering)
            Mark invited me to the party.

<b>                  JODY     
</b>             What party?

<b>                  SANDY
</b>           Shh. Ben's party. Tonight.
           Haven't you heard?

<b>                 JODY
</b>           No.

Sandy notices that a teacher is nearby. Sandy pulls Jody into a stairwell.

<b>INT.  STAIRWELL
</b>
Jody is now really intrigued.

<b>                  SANDY
</b>              (whispering)
           You can't tell your parents.

<b>                  JODY
</b>           Ok.

<b>                  SANDY
</b>           Especially not your dad.

<b>                  JODY
</b>           I won't.

<b>                  SANDY
</b>             (whispering)
           It's like a pop your cherry party.
           Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.

<b>                 JODY
</b>           You're thinking of sleeping with Mark
           tonight?

<b>                  SANDY
</b>           Unless he makes a move during
           seventh period.

<b>                  JODY
</b>           Didn't you have something a little
           more romantic in mind for your first
           time?

<b>                 SANDY
</b>             (very excited)
           I kind of like the idea that we can all
           lose it together, on the same night.
           It'll be a lot less scary. You have to
           go.

<b>                 JODY
</b>           Stag?

<b>                SANDY
</b>           Kenny'll want to go with you.
           Cindy's holding a Q and A
           session at the bleachers.
           Come on.

<b>                JODY
</b>           I can't right now.

<b>                 SANDY
</b>           Jody, you have to go to the party.
           For your own safety.

Sandy takes off.

<b>EXT.  BLEACHERS
</b>
Cindy is setting with a group of girls, the center of attention.

<b>                CINDY
</b>            You all are such hypocrites.
            All year long you sit on your
            judgmental little butts and 
            call me the slut from hell.
            NOW YOU RUN TO ME, quaking in fear,
            BEGGING for advice...

<b>                HYPOCRITE GIRL 1
</b>           Yeah. SO?

<b>                 HYPOCRITE GIRL 2
</b>           What were we supposed to call you
           Cindy?

<b>                 GIRL 1
</b>           The slut from heaven?

<b>                GIRL 3
</b>            Just answer our questions please?

Sandy runs up.

<b>                CINDY
</b>               (loving the role)
           What do you want to know?

<b>                 GIRL 3
</b>           What to do.

<b>                CINDY
</b>           You have to do everything
           Boys are totally clueless when
           it comes to sex.

This answer terrifies the audience.

                 CINDY(cont'd)
           It starts with them trying to
           unhook our bras, fumbling around,
           and never changes. Wait until they try
           to put their dicks in you.

<b>                 GIRL 2
</b>           Please don't say they need our help
           with that.

<b>                 CINDY
</b>           Always. Unless you want them to just
           poke around endlessly.

The girls had no idea.

<b>INT.  CAR
</b>
Three stoners are smoking a bowl in their car. They are not nearly as 
collaborative or supportive of one another as the girls were.

<b>                BOY 1
</b>           Romeo here asked me if chicks has two
           holes or three.

<b>                 BOY 2
</b>           I did not.

<b>                BOY 1
</b>           You did so.

<b>                 BOY 2
</b>           I was kidding.

<b>                BOY 3
</b>           Were not dude.

<b>                 BOY 1
</b>           I know it's a total bummer
           that three kids are dead, but, I'm sorry,
           this is kind of great.

<b>                 BOY 3
</b>           I'm way into this. This may be the best
           of all possible worlds.

<b>                 BOY 2
</b>           No. The killer could be offing
           chicks who haven't given head.

They all laugh again and nod, slapping hands, Beavis and Butt-head style.
<b>                BOY 2
</b>           Then I'd only have to worry about
           one.

They all laugh again.

<b>EXT.  PARKING LOT
</b>
Two HOMELY GIRLS, one rail thin, the other slightly overweight, walk back 
towards the school.

<b>                 HOMELY GIRL 1
</b>           We'll meet someone at the party.

<b>                 HOMELY GIRL 2
</b>           You don't know that.

<b>                 HOMELY GIRL 1
</b>           If we don't, we sit back and watch
           everyone else camel.
           That's got to be better than
           hanging at your house.

<b>                 HOMELY GIRL 2
</b>           I'm not going.

They notice a group of kids huddled around a car.

<b>                  HOMELY GIRL 1
</b>           What's that?

They walk up.

'VIRGIN' has been written in blood on one of the windshields.  A mutilated 
boy looks out of the driver's window of the car.  The girl's faces go 
white. IT'S ANOTHER BODY!

More and more kids gather around the murder site. The kids are all 
freaked, giving each other the eye. No one wants to be next.

All of a sudden the body moves, screaming to the heavens, freaking all the 
kids out. The dead body leaps out of the car and runs away as other kids 
and teachers run over. Everyone heard the scream.

Homely girl 2 whispers to her friend.

<b>                   HOMELY GIRL 2
</b>                (whispering)
             Ok. Pick me up at seven.

<b>INT.  CORRIDOR
</b>
Chaos has taken over the school. Hardly anyone is still going to classes.

Kenny is standing in the hallway, looking for Jody. He knows her class 
schedule and that she'll be passing by.

Jody appears from her classroom. She starts toward Kenny, at first not 
noticing him.

Jody looks up and she sees him. She stops. She knows what he's there to 
talk to her about. He runs over to her.

<b>                   KENNY
</b>                (very concerned)
           Are you O.K.?

<b>                    JODY
</b>           I'm fine.

<b>                    KENNY
</b>           I heard you got attacked.

<b>                   JODY
</b>           I did.

<b>                    KENNY
</b>           I was worried about you.
           Did you hear about the bash?

<b>                    JODY
</b>           Yeah. I think it's really sick.

<b>                    KENNY
</b>           Why?

<b>                    JODY
</b>           Three of our classmates are dead.
           That's not really the occasion
           for a party.

<b>                   KENNY
</b>           Nobody wants to be the fourth.
           Please go with me.

<b>                   JODY
</b>           Did Sharon say no?

<b>                    KENNY
</b>           You know I want to go with you.

<b>                    JODY
</b>           I'm so flattered but I can't.
           I'm grounded.

<b>                    KENNY
</b>            Everyone's grounded. There's a
           killer on the loose.

<b>                    JODY
</b>           No I'm really grounded.
           When I got in late the other night,
           my father was waiting up for me. 

He grabs her passionately.

<b>                    KENNY
</b>           If you don't want to go with me just
           say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE
           LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an
           excuse. I'm so sick of it.

<b>                   JODY
</b>           I'm not using him as an excuse.

<b>OF COURSE SHE IS.
</b>
<b>                   KENNY
</b>           Yes you are. You always do.
           It's why we broke up. You always
           hide behind him.
<b>     
</b><b>                    JODY
</b>           I do not.

<b>                    KENNY
</b>           I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S
           permission just to kiss you.
           Jody, it's time to assert yourself
           To be a big girl. An individual.
           I'm going to this party tonight.
           Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my
           house after school. We'll go together.

<b>                   JODY
</b>           I have to go home after school.
           I have something really important
           I have to ask my mom.

<b>                 KENNY
</b>           They're not picking me up until six.

<b>                 JODY
</b>           I'll think about it.

<b>                  KENNY
</b>           Yes!

He kisses her full throttle. She's into it. She smiles at him as he darts 
off. She's happy but scared. She's got her guy back, at least for the 
moment.

<b>INT.  SCHOOL
</b>
The clock strikes three. The bell rings.

<b>EXT.  SCHOOL
</b>
Kids charge out, ready for a memorable evening.

<b>INT.  JODY'S HOUSE
</b>
Jody's mother is in the kitchen, preparing dinner, watching TV.

<b>                 REPORTER
</b>                (on TV)
          A series of savage killings has turned
          this small community of Cherry Falls, Ohio
          inside out. In the last two days, three teenagers
          have been killed, a fourth attacked. The killer
          seems to be targeting high school virgins. Here's
          our WWJB reporter Mike Stanton outside the local
          high school with an up to the minute report.

<b>EXT.  HIGH SCHOOL
</b>
MIKE STANTON turns around toward the high school to report on the day's 
events but before he can get a word out a young GIRL who has recognized 
him, walks up to him. Her GIRLFRIENDS giggle behind her.

<b>                 GIRL
</b>            Hi.

<b>                 MIKE
</b>            Hi, I'm Mike Stanton.

<b>                 GIRL
</b>            I know.

She grabs him and kisses him. He's shocked. She runs off giggling with her 
friends. A boy walks through in the background and makes a lewd hip 
humping gesture at the TV camera.

<b>INT.  KITCHEN
</b>
Jody's mom can't believe what she's seeing on the news.

<b>EXT.  HOUSE
</b>
Jody walks in the back door.

<b>INT.  KITCHEN
</b>
Her mom flips off the TV AS Jody enters the kitchen.

<b>                  JODY
</b>              Hi mom.

<b>                   MARGE
</b>              Hi princess.

<b>                   JODY
</b>              Mom?

<b>                   MARGE
</b>              Yes?

<b>                  JODY
</b>             I need to ask you something.

<b>                   MARGE
</b>             You can ask me anything.

<b>                  JODY
</b>             Have you ever heard of someone
             named Lisa Sherman?

Mom's cutting hand starts to shake. She pretends that she doesn't know who 
Lisa Sherman is but she obviously does.

<b>                   MARGE
</b>             Lisa Sherman?

<b>                   JODY
</b>             Yeah. Who is she?

<b>                   MARGE
</b>             I don't know. Where did you
             hear that name.

<b>                   JODY
</b>             I overheard daddy mentioning
             her to someone. I he thinks she's the
             killer.

<b>                  MARGE
</b>             What?
<b>     
</b><b>                  JODY
</b>             That's what he said.

<b>                  MARGE
</b>             Did he say anything else about her?

<b>                   JODY
</b>             No but he got really weird.
             Like I've never seen him act.
             REALLY angry and super uptight.

<b>                   MARGE
</b>                (lying)
             I've never heard of her.
             Maybe something else was on
             his mind.

<b>                   JODY
</b>             No. I think she lived her a
             long time ago. Like twenty-eight
             years ago. When dad was eighteen.

<b>                  MARGE
</b>             Not that I know of.

Jody is suspicious. Jody thinks for a moment, then picks her coat back up.

<b>                  MARGE
</b>             Where are you going?

<b>                   JODY
</b>             The library. I'll be fine.

Jody heads out the door. Her mother goes to the window, very concerned and 
watches her ride away. She picks up the phone.

<b>INT.  POLICE STATION - BRENT'S OFFICE
</b>
BRENT is on the phone. His deputy is with him.

<b>                  BRENT
</b>           What's the address?
           Thanks.

He hangs up the phone.

<b>                  DEPUTY
</b>           You found her?

<b>                  BRENT
</b>           There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty
           miles west of here. Over the Indiana border.
           I'm going.

<b>                 DEPUTY
</b>           We need you here. I can bring her in.

<b>                 BRENT
</b>           No. I'll handle this.

<b>INT. STATION
</b>
Brent and the deputy head into the main station area. Brent grabs his gun. 
The DESK SERGEANT is on the phone.

<b>                 DESK SERGEANT
</b>           Sir, we're getting calls from other
           towns. Boys throughout the country have
           heard about what's going on here and they're
           heading our way, apparently, looking for girls.

<b>                 BRENT
</b>           Put a squad car at every entrance to town.

The desk sergeant picks up another call.

<b>                  SERGEANT
</b>           Your wife's on line three.

<b>                 BRENT
</b>           I can't talk to her now.

<b>                  SERGEANT
</b>           There's a problem with Jody.

<b>                 BRENT
</b>           Tell her she has to handle it.

He heads outside.

<b>EXT.  POLICE STATION
</b>
The deputy walks Brent to his car.

<b>                 DEPUTY
</b>            As bizarre as it may sound,
            seems someone is planning to
            have a big party tonight.

<b>                 BRENT
</b>            No?

<b>                  DEPUTY
</b>           Should we close down any eruption?

<b>                 BRENT
</b>           Are you sure?

<b>                 DEPUTY
</b>           We're seeing all the signs in town.

<b>                 BRENT
</b>           I like the idea of all the kids in
           one place. If it happens, just keep
           a man outside until you hear from me.
           I'll be back in a couple of hours.

He jumps in his car and speeds away.

<b>EXT.  LIBRARY

The gray old ivy-covered town library. Jody rides up and heads inside.

<b>INT.  LIBRARY
</b>
Jody enters the vast library. It's empty. Almost spooky. A seventy year 
old lady, MISS DUNLOP is behind the desk, robotically stamping the back 
flaps of books.

<b>                 MISS DUNLOP
</b>           Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?

<b>                  JODY
</b>           Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep
           the old town papers?

<b>                  MISS DUNLOP
</b>           They're all on microfiche.
           What year are you looking for?

<b>                 JODY
</b>           Twenty eight years ago.

<b>                 MISS DUNLOP

They head up the stairs and into the microfilm room.

<b>                 JODY
</b>           This place is empty.

<b>                MISS DUNLOP
</b>           Everyone's getting ready for the party.

<b>                MISS DUNLOP
</b>           Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP
           IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering
           about it all day.

<b>                JODY
</b>           Don't you think it's sick?

<b>                 MISS DUNLOP
</b>           Not at all. In fact, I thought
           about going.

<b>                JODY
</b>           You Miss Dunlop?

She hands Jody the microfiche.

<b>                MISS DUNLOP
</b>           Unfortunately I qualify.
           Think I'm too old?
<b>          
</b><b>                JODY
</b>              (lying)
           No.

<b>               MISS DUNLOP
</b>           You're sweet. I really wish
           someone had thrown a party          
           like that when I was your age.           
           My life might have been very
           different.

<b>SHE SLOWLY HEADS DOWN THE STAIRS.
</b>
cut to:

<b>INT.  LIBRARY - MICROFICHE ROOM
</b>
The newspaper headlines from 1970 pass by.

Jody is watching them flash by.

She slows down, then goes back. She's found what she's looking for.

A picture of LISA SHERMAN. It's her yearbook picture. She looks eerily 
identical to the picture that Jody drew. The headline reads 'High School 
Senior Attacked In park'.

Jody hears footsteps coming up the stairs. She looks up. The footsteps  
stop.

The old library is still. She senses that someone is watching her.

<b>                  JODY
</b>             (a little scared)
           Is that you Miss Dunlop?

No answer. She hears a bit of rustling from behind one of the shelves of 
books directly behind her.

A book accidentally drops to the ground.

She realizes that someone is right there, watching her.

<b>                  JODY
</b>           Who's there?

She sees a pair of shoes behind the book shelf but she can't see the face. 
The shoes start around the book shelf, toward her.

Jody leaps to her feet, ready to run. Her mom appears.

<b>                  JODY
</b>           Mom? You were spying on me.

Mom looks at the monitor, at the picture of Lisa Sherman's face.

<b>                  MARGE
</b>           I want you to come home with
           me right now, Jody.

<b>                  JODY
</b>           Who is she?

<b>                 MARGE
</b>           She's nobody you should be concerned
           with.

<b>                  JODY
</b>           Whoever tried to kill me
           was made up to look exactly 
           like this picture of Lisa Sherman,
           clothes and all. I think that
           concerns me.

<b>                 MARGE
</b>           Don't make me order you.

Jody sits back down.

<b>                 JODY
</b>           You going to drag me out and me in my
           room until I go to college?

Marge sits down next to Jody and takes her hand.

<b>                 MARGE
</b>           If I have to. Please
           let me protect you.

Jody is at a crossroads. Jody doesn't know what to do. Her mother hugs 
her, puts her arm around her, and almost lifts her out of her seat. She 
leads her down the stairs, away from the old newspaper.

<b>INT.  LIBRARY
</b>
Jody's mom leads her across the vast hallway. They come to the door 
leading out of the library. Jody stops and looks back. She sees the old 
spinster Miss Dunlop, stacking the books.

<b>                  JODY
</b>           Wait.
<b>     
</b><b>                  MARGE
</b>           What?

<b>                  JODY
</b>             (asserting herself)
           I'm not leaving. I want to
           know why you and dad are
           so freaked out. Three of my
           classmates are dead.

Mom doesn't like this at all.

<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT.  LIBRARY
</b>
A beautiful garden on the edge of the library. The autumn wind is blowing. 
The leaves are at the height of foliage. Jody and her mom are seated on a  
carved stone bench.

<b>                  MARGE
</b>           Years ago, something horrible
           happened in this town. When I
           was still in high school. A girl
           named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by
           four drunken seniors.

<b>                   JODY
</b>           Attacked how?

<b>                  MARGE
</b>           She was raped. At least that's
           what she claimed.

<b>                  JODY
</b>           You didn't believe her?

<b>                  MARGE
</b>               (confessing)
           No, I believed her. She was in
           pretty bad shape. Inside and out.
           But the boys were never formally
           charged.

<b>                   JODY
</b>           Why not?

<b>                   MARGE
</b>           They were children of our leading
           citizens, stars of the football team.
           And she was  a loner. An angry girl
           that no one really liked. She'd called
           them 'queers'.

<b>                  JODY
</b>           People thought these guys had a
           right to rape her because she called
           them 'queers'?

<b>                  MARGE
</b>           They were proving to her they weren't.
           They were very drunk. Things were different
           back then. You think kids are sexually
           bottled up today....

<b>                  JODY
</b>           And the police did nothing?

<b>                   MARGE
</b><b>           EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
</b>
<b>                   JODY
</b>           How could you?

<b>                   MARGE
</b>            I don't know. We just did. I guess
           I was kind of scared going against the gain.
           Against the whole town.

<b>                   JODY
</b>          The word is Mob.

<b>                   MARGE
</b>           I've regretted it ever since.
           Never run with the herd just because
           they're the herd.

<b>                  JODY
</b>           Who were they?

Marge freezes. She didn't want to be asked that.

<b>                   MARGE
</b>           Who?

<b>                   JODY
</b>           The men. Do any of them still
           live around here?

<b>                  MARGE
</b>           Two men left town right after
           it happened.

<b>                  JODY
</b>           You're not telling me something.

Marge takes a deep breath, unsure what to say.

<b>                  MARGE
</b>            Mr. Sisler was one of them.

<b>                  JODY
</b>                (shocked)
             The principal?

<b>                  MARGE
</b>            Yes.

<b>                  JODY
</b>            Who was the fourth?

Marge is stricken. She looks down.

<b>                   MARGE
</b>            God. It's like everything that was
            ever repressed in this town is suddenly
            bubbling up through the ground.

Jody gets it.

<b>                  JODY
</b>            Dad?

Her mother can't deny it any longer.

<b>                  JODY(CONT'D)
</b>              (horrified)
           THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first.
           He was one of them.

<b>                  MARGE
</b>           Not a day has gone by where your     
             father has not torn himself to shreds
           for what happened. We both have...

<b>                  JODY
</b><b>           NO!
</b>
Jody gets up.
<b>                  MARGE
</b>           He dedicated his life to law
           enforcement after...

Jody runs off, very upset.

<b>EXT.  LIBRARY
</b>
Jody jumps on her bicycle and speeds off.

<b>EXT.  GARDEN
</b>
Marge sits down and stares straight ahead, crushed.

<b>EXT.  INDIANA DIRT ROAD
</b>
The rusty old mailbox on the forgotten dirt road reads 'Lisa Sherman'
Brent's police car turns into the driveway.

<b>INT.  CAR
</b>
Brent pulls up to the house. he sits and stares for a moment.

<b>EXT.  LISA SHERMAN'S HOUSE
</b>
It's a dilapidated old house, uncared for, overgrown, a 'For Sale' sign 
stands crookedly in the front yard.

Brent gets out of the car and heads to the front door, stepping over rusty 
tools and old auto parts.

<b>EXT.  FRONT DOOR
</b>
Brent lifts his hand and is about to knock. He can't. He walks around in a 
circle, composing himself, preparing himself to face Lisa Sherman after 
all these years. He draws the gun from his holster and knocks.

No one answers.

He knocks again.

No one answers, again.

A WOMAN, THE CARETAKER, appears from the side of the house.

<b>                  CARETAKER
</b>                Hello?

<b>                  BRENT
</b>                I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.

<b>                  CARETAKER
</b>                She's not here.

<b>                  BRENT
</b>               You know where I can find her?

<b>                  CARETAKER
</b>               St. Michael's.

<b>                  BRENT
</b>               She works at a church?

<b>                  CARETAKER
</b>               She resides there. Out back.
               She died a year and a half ago.

Brent feels terribly guilty about what he did to Lisa Sherman, but also 
terribly relieved that he'll never have to face her. It's been a  long 
time since he's confronted his hidden past. He puts his gun away.

<b>                   BRENT
</b>              Of what?

<b>                  CARETAKER
</b>              A bullet to the right cerebellum.

<b>                   BRENT
</b>              She was murdered?

<b>                  CARETAKER
</b>              No. She ate a pistol for lunch
              one day.

Brent can't help but feel responsible.

<b>                   BRENT
</b>              Can you describe her? How old
              was she?

<b>                    CARETAKER
</b>              I never met the woman. I'm just taking
              care of the place until they sell it.

<b>                   BRENT
</b>              Can you get inside?

<b>                   CARETAKER
</b>              I can.

<b>                   BRENT
</b>             I knew Lisa Sherman long ago.
             It's extremely important that I
             get inside and try to verify that it's the
             same woman who lived here.

<b>                   CARETAKER
</b>             I don't give a fuck what your reasons
             are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside
             Otherwise, get a warrant.

He pulls out his wallet.

Cut to:

Jody rides up to Kenny's house.

<b>INT.  HOUSE

Kenny sees her from his bedroom window.

<b>INT.  FRONT HALLWAY

Kenny comes tearing downstairs.

<b>EXT.  FRONT DOOR
</b>
Kenny, opens the front door, very excited.

<b>                   KENNY
</b>               Jody!
               (he kisses her)
               Yes! You're here.

Jody wipes a tear from her eye. Kenny notices how upset she is.

<b>                  KENNT(CONT'D)
</b>              What's the matter?

Jody bursts into tears. She hugs him. He hugs her back and leads her 
inside.

<b>INT.  HOUSE
</b>
An old rundown house. The clutter smells. Whoever lived here had little to 
no self respect. Garbage is piled up in every corner, order is nowhere. 
Brent is repulsed by what he sees. he wasn't expecting such chaos. He 
knows he helped create this mess.

<b>                   BRENT
</b>             Is there a picture of her somewhere?

<b>                   CARETAKER
</b>             No pictures. No mirrors.
             Was she a crazy woman when
             you knew her?

<b>                    BRENT
</b>             (feeling very guilty)
             No.

<b>                    CARETAKER
</b>             Couldn't tell she going to off
             herself, huh?

<b>                    BRENT
</b>             No, you couldn't.

<b>                    CARETAKER
</b>            I've been in a lot of people's
            houses and this one's the creepiest.

<b>                    BRENT
</b>            Really?

<b>                    CARETAKER
</b>            Yeah. You should check downstairs.

<b>                    BRENT
</b>            Why?

<b>                    CARETAKER
</b>           People always keep their secrets in their
           attics or in their basements. All the 
           weirdness in this house took place in the
           basement.

The woman flips on the basement light. There are several locks on the 
door. Brent is very scared of what he's going to find down there.

<b>INT.  BASEMENT
</b>
Brent steps down into the basement.

It is a combination prison/bedroom. It looks like it hasn't been cleaned 
in years. Water drips for the ceiling. Rat traps are everywhere. Old 
broken child's TOYS are stacked in one corner below some handcuffs which 
are bolted into the wall above a cot. The cot is small, the mattress 
rotted. Old shit lies dried on the floor piss stains line every wall.

Huge nails and odd iron objects sit in one corner.

Brent walks over to the dresser and looks in it. He pulls out a pair of 
grown man's trousers. He examines them.

<b>                  CARETAKER
</b>           They look like they'd fit you.
           Three bucks.

Brent things for a moment then throws the pants down. He darts back up the 
stairs. The caretaker laughs.

<b>INT.  KENNY'S
</b>
Jody and Kenny are in Kenny's bedroom, sitting on his bed.

<b>                   KENNY
</b>            All our parents are weirdoes.
            I think my dad is into hookers.
            I know he lit cats on fire when
            he was a kid.

<b>                   JODY
</b>              (all wound up)
           My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking
           Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking
           Rapist.

<b>                   KENNY
</b>             (compassionately)
           I think this is a big part of growing up.
           It's losing your spiritual virginity.
           It's when you finally discover that your
           parents aren't anything they told you they
           were. They're even bigger hypocrites than     
           your friends.

<b>                   JODY
</b>           I can't believe I listened to one word of
           his shit.

<b>                   KENNY
</b>           But if he'd been sent to jail,
           there would be no Jody.

<b>                   JODY
</b>           So I should feel happy that he got
           away with it?

<b>                   KENNY
</b>           I don't know. I kind of am.

Jody, still crying, stares at Kenny for a second then leans in and kisses 
him with everything she's got, Ready for action.

<b>                   KENNY
</b>           Are you coming to the party?

<b>                   JODY
</b>           Let's just start a party right here,
           right fucking now.

Jody quickly takes her own shirt off, rips off his, and pounces on him. 
He's taken aback by her sudden aggressiveness. He has no idea how to 
respond to it.

<b>INT.  TOWN HALL
</b>
Brent comes storming out of the hall of records.

<b>INT.  PHONE BOOTH
</b>
Frantic dialing. Brent is on the phone.

<b>INT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE
</b>
The phone rings. The answering machine picks up.

<b>                   BRENT
</b>                (leaving a message)
           Tom? Lisa Sherman is dead. But you'll
           never believe what I found out. Meet
           me at the Roadhouse on Route nine in a
           half hour. We need to talk in private.

As Brent finishes his message the camera moves across the principal's 
desk, first revealing a few blood drops on a piece of paper and then the 
killer's hand, holding the razor. The killer has been listening to the 
message.

Tom, the principal, is sitting in the corner in  a large puddle of his own 
blood, tied to the radiator. He's barely alive. His tongue has been cut 
out, his foot cut off at the ankle and shoved into his mouth. One eye is 
missing, the other one has been left in only so that Tom can look into the 
killer's face as he's tortured.

The razor blade is lifted off the table.

Tom braces himself, gripping his hands, preparing for more pain.

The camera moves back to the phone as we hear Tom gag and then the killer 
walking out of the room.

<b>INT.  KENNY'S
</b>
Jody is all over Kenny. He's really weirded out by her aggressiveness.  
She reaches for his crotch and finds that he's soft. She rolls over, 
embarrassed.

<b>                  JODY
</b>                (worried)
            What's wrong? Am I doing something
            wrong?

<b>                   KENNY
</b>            Just making me feel like a piece
            of meat.

<b>                  JODY
</b>           I'm making you feel like meat?

<b>                  KENNY
</b>           Yeah.

Jody rolls over, a bit pissed off and very confused.

<b>                  JODY
</b>           You break up with me because
           I won't fuck you.

<b>                  KENNY
</b>           That's not why we broke up.

<b>                  JODY
</b>           You flaunt some slut in my face.

<b>                  KENNY
</b>           Sharon's far from a slut.

<b>                   JODY
</b>           And when I finally agree to spread
           my legs, you accuse me of treating
           you like meat.

<b>                  KENNY
</b>           Jody, you're only doing this to
           get back at your dad. It doesn't
           have that much to do with me.

She gets up angry, and starts putting her clothes back on. That was the 
wrong note to play. The truth hurts.

Sandy is getting ready to go to the party, making herself look as hot as 
possible, and she looks hot. There's a knock on the door. She's scared to 
answer it, considering how she's dressed. Her dad comes in and sits on the 
bed. Sandy turns away from and buttons her top shirt button up.

<b>                    DAD

One couple runs towards the front door howling.

Another boy pulls his obviously frightened girlfriend into the house, 
reassuring her that everything will be fine.

Lots of kids are milling around outside because two big football players 
and their dates are guarding the front door. There's a big sign that says 
"Couples only". Lots of hooking up is taking place on the front lawn.

Two computer nerds are hidden behind a tree, watching the other kids 
arrive. They spot the two homely girls we saw earlier.

</b>           You can't bring it.

<b>                NERD 2
</b>           I'm not leaving it here.

Nerd 2 heads toward the girls, taking his laptop. Nerd 1 follows, pissed 
off. They walk up near the homely girls and make eye contact. After 
several uncomfortable moments, someone shouts for an upper window.

<b>                GIRL IN WINDOW

           Floor space is almost gone.

This only heightens the uncomfortable ness outside. One of the homely 
girls looks at the laptop.

Jody rides down the street, just pedaling fast, as fast as she can.
She's in her own world, very upset.

A car comes toward the intersection on the other street but doesn't slow 
down, knowing the light is about to change.

A boy in a passing car whistles at Jody, waking her out of her stupor.  
Jody looks up just as the light turns red. She hits her brakes and skids 
into the tail of the oncoming car. She glances off it and goes sliding off 
the road, into a few garbage cans.

The car nicks another car and pulls over.

Across the street, we see that the Killer's IMPERIAL is stopped at the red 
light.

Jody gets up, shaken. He knees and elbows are badly scratched.

The OWNER of the car comes running over to Jody.

<b>                 OWNER

Jody turns around. Her teacher Leonard Marliston is there. The killer's 
IMPERIAL is parked behind him. Jody wipes away the tears.

<b>                  JODY

A couple of boys lean out of their cars and invite Jody to the go to the 
party. Sirens scream out in the distance.

Leonard pulls into his driveway. Jody pulls in behind. She leans the bike 
on the front porch and they head into the house.

<b>                  LEONARD
</b>            You aren't going to the party?

<b>                  JODY

Mr. Leonard opens the door to his house. Jody walks in behind him.

<b>     
</b><b>                  LEONARD

<b>                  JODY
</b>            Of course I'm scared.

<b>                  LEONARD

<b>                  LEONARD
</b>            I really do. For your own
            safety.

Jody doesn't know what to make of this. It's not what she expected to hear 
from her teacher.

Leonard goes into the kitchen. Jody sits on the couch and looks around. 
She's immediately sensing that something is off about the place. It's 
certainly not the way she imagined a teacher's house to look. It has all 
sorts of city plans, maps, and drawings on the walls. Years of Cherry 
Falls yearbooks and newspapers are stacked in piles.

He reappears with two beers and a pot filled with soapy water. He hands 
her a beer.

<b>                  JODY
</b>            I just feel so manipulated.
            By everyone. My dad, my boyfriend,
            and now some psychopath I don't
            even know.

SHE TAKES THE BEER, surprised he's giving her alcohol. He kneels down in 
front of her and begins to clean the wound on her leg.

<b>                  LEONARD
</b>            We're all manipulated. From the moment
            we're born. The event that fatalistically shaped
            my life happened before I was even born.

<b>                  JODY
</b>            Really?

<b>                  LEONARD
</b>            Yes. We have no real freedom.
            You of all people should understand
            that. This may sting.

Jody is beginning to feel strange. There's something off kilter about this 
whole encounter.

<b>                  JODY
</b>            Me? Why me?

<b>                  LEONARD
</b>             Because of your father.
            The way what his sins shaped you.

He starts putting a disinfectant on her wound.

<b>                  JODY
</b>            What do you know about my father?

<b>                  LEONARD
</b>            He's a rapist. Like mine.

She grimaces. The disinfectant hurts.

<b>                  JODY
</b>                (a little scared)_
            Your father raped someone?

<b>                  LEONARD
</b>            Lisa Sherman was my mother.
            Do you know who that is?

<b>                   JODY
</b>            Yes.

<b>                  LEONARD
</b>           I was born nine months after she was
           raped. One of the four men who raped
           her is my father. I have no idea which one.

<b>                  JODY
</b>           You're the killed.

<b>                 LEONARD
</b>           Yes that's the whole point. This is
           what I was put on this earth to do.
           Rape the town that raped my mother.
           Steal its pristine innocence like it
           stole hers. I've planned this since I was
           a very little boy. You have no real freedom
           either. Your father has cast a shadow that
           you've never eluded.

Jody gets up and starts backing away from him but he gets up quickly. He's 
not letting her get away.

Jody bolts for the door but she doesn't have time to open it.

Leonard grabs her and throws her across the room.

Jody smashes into a  table. He bends down to pick her up, but she pulls a 
book case over on him, narrowly escaping.

She runs for the back door.

<b>INT.  BACK DOOR
</b>
Jody opens the back door and gets halfway out when Leonard runs up to her, 
pulls her away from the door, and slugs her in the face, sending her 
sprawling to the ground. He picks her up and punches her a second time, 
breaking her nose, knocking her half out. He picks her up by the waist and 
carries her to the basement stairs.

<b>INT.  BASEMENT STAIRS

Leonard throws Jody down into the dark basement. She tumbles down the 
stairs, hitting her head on the cold stone floor.

He comes charging down after her, closing the door behind them.

<b>INT.  A CLOSET

Sandy and Mark are gently kissing in the closet, still standing up. Mark 
studies Sandy's face for a second, then slowly lifts her dress, sliding 
his hand on to her thighs.

Mark smiles, embarrassed. They kiss. They're falling in love.

ECU - ELECTRONIC beeps come off a computer screen as a warrior armed with

The nerds and the homely girls are in the corner playing the computer

<b>INT.  BASEMENT

As Jody comes to, she finds herself gagged, tied to a chair in the dark 
basement. She can't see much but she can hear the sounds of water dripping 
and a rat scurrying around. She tips her chair over and falls onto the 
cold floor. She tries to removes her gag by rubbing her head against the 
ground.

<b>EXT.  LEONARD'S HOUSE
</b>
Leonard goes to his station wagon and opens the back.

<b>INT.   CAR
</b>
A body is hidden under a blanket. Leonard picks it up. It's too heavy.

<b>INT.   BASEMENT
</b>
Jody can't undo her gag but she notices a piece of glass under a dresser. 
She turns herself around to grab for it.

She squeezes her hand under the dresser, reaching for the shard.

The door at the top of the stairs opens.

Leonard appears in silhouette carrying the body wrapped in a blanket. He 
throws it down the stairs and turns the lights on.

The basement is almost an exact replication of the basement in his 
mother's house. A cot in the same spot. The dresser as well. The Lisa 
Sherman costume is neatly hung from big metal hooks.

Leonard sits Jody back up.

A little blood drips from Jody's closed hands. She has the shard.

Leonard ties the other body to a chair facing Jody. He starts singing SLY 
<b>AND THE FAMILY STONE.
</b>
<b>                  LEONARD

             'It's a family affair,
             It's a family affair.'

He undoes the blanket revealing the battered but still breathing body of 
Jody's dad. Brent's bleeding from the forehead, nose, and mouth. He's 
badly beaten up.

Jody gags on her gag. Her dad looks her in the eye.

<b>                   LEONARD
</b>             Well, we may be family
             One in four chance.

Leonard picks up his razor and starts towards Jody.

<b>                   LEONARD
</b>             Sheriff Brent, you will be the
             second of the four horsemen of
             the apocalypse to die. But first you
             will watch as I slice up your little
             girl.

Brent starts frantically shaking no, trying to escape as Leonard kneels in 
front of Jody and runs his hands up under her dress, exposing her shaved, 
nubile leg. The 'V' is still fresh in her calf.

Leonard starts to cut an 'I' next to it.

Jody's face grimaces in pain. Blood drips to the ground. Her leg starts to 
shake.          

<b>                    LEONARD
</b>           You're shaking too much.
           If you don't stop shaking Jody,
           I'll have to kill before I carve.
           We wouldn't want that.

Jody concentrates on trying to show no pain, not to flinch. It's tough. 
Her father watches, 
horrified.

Cut to:

<b>EXT.  STREET
</b>
Kenny runs down the street, heading toward Jody's house. He stops to catch 
his breath for a second.
He notices something.

<b>EXT.  LEONARD'S
</b>
Jody's bicycle is still leaning against Leonard's porch.

<b>EXT.  STREET
</b>
Kenny crosses the street to Leonard's house and inspects the bicycle. It's 
hers.

<b>INT.  BASEMENT
</b>
Leonard continues to work on Jody's bare leg, starting the 'R'. Jody and 
her father stare at each other, helplessly.

<b>                  LEONARD
</b>           My mother said, after you and your
           three droogs raped her Brent, that people
           in town refused to let her use their bathrooms.
           Is that true? Did people really call her a slut
           and tell her 'you can't shit here'? She used to
           snarl that at me. That's all she really did, at least
           in my direction, was snarl. When she looked at me, 
           she saw only you.

Jody gags in pain. Brent looks away.

<b>                   LEONARD
</b>            Open your eyes Brent. Watch. Or
            will I cause her much more pain.

Brent opens his eyes. More blood drips. Jody starts to lose consciousness, 
barely able to stand it 
anymore. The doorbell rings. Leonard looks up, concerned.

<b>EXT.  HOUSE
</b>
Kenny rings it again. No one answers.

He walks over to the window and looks through a crack underneath the 
curtains.

<b>INT.  HOUSE
</b>
Kenny's POV - Jody's coat and purse are still on the couch.

<b>EXT.  HOUSE
</b>
Kenny senses that something is really off. He rings again but no one 
answers.  Worried, he pops the screen. It's breaking and entering time.

<b>INT.  LIVING ROOM
</b>
Kenny climbs into the living room and looks around.

<b>                    KENNY
</b>              Hello? Jody?

<b>INT.   BASEMENT
</b>
Leonard hears Kenny. He can't ignore him any longer.

<b>                     LEONARD
</b>             Who the fuck is breaking into my house?

Leonard checks Jody's and Brent's ropes are tight, then heads up the 
stairs. As soon as he disappears, Jody wriggles toward her father and 
starts cutting his ropes with the shard of glass.

<b>INT.    HOUSE
</b>
Leonard comes out of the basement and peers into the living room.

<b>INT.    LIVING ROOM
</b>
Leonard sees Kenny opening Jody's purse, checking it out.

Leonard keeps the razor hidden behind his back.

<b>                       LEONARD
</b>              My wallet's on the mantle
              when you've finished your rifling,
              Kenny.

Kenny looks up, startled.

<b>                       KENNY
</b>                   (nervously)
              Oh, hey Mr. Marliston. W-What's Jody's
              bike doing on your front porch?

<b>                       LEONARD
</b>             That all depends Kenny. Depends on why
             the FUCK you've broken into your history
             teacher's house?

<b>                      KENNY
</b>            Alright, Marliston, I know she's here.
<b>            
</b><b>                       LEONARD
</b>            What are you talking about? No one here
            but us chickens.

<b>INT.  BASEMENT 
</b>
Jody cuts through her dad's ropes. Her dad immediately takes Jody's gag 
off.

<b>INT.  LIVING ROOM
</b>
Kenny heads out the door.

<b>                      JODY(O.C.)
</b>             Help!

Kenny hears the cry and turns around.

<b>                      KENNY
</b>             That was Jody!

Leonard says nothing. He just stares at Kenny.

<b>                      JODY(O.C.)
</b>             Somebody help!

Kenny heads toward the basement door to investigate. Brent starts kicking 
on the other side of the locked door.

<b>                      KENNY
</b>              Jody?!

Leonard moves towards Kenny with the razor. Kenny turns just in time.  He 
grabs Leonard's arm as Leonard tries to slit his throat. They struggle.

The door lock starts to shake as Brent continues to kick the door open 
from the other side.

Leonard picks up a  lamp with his free hand and smashes Kenny across the 
head. Kenny falls to the ground.

The door pops open. Brent charges out. Leonard turns to him and slashes 
him across the chest as Brent sprays red paint in Leonard's eyes. Leonard 
screams, and lunges at Brent.

Brent grabs Leonard. Using every ounce of energy he has, he throws Leonard 
down the basement stairs.

Leonard grabs Brent as he tumbles down the stairs. The two roll to the 
bottom, smashing their heads along the way. As they come to a stop, Brent 
smashes his head hard on the floor. Leonard ends up on top of him. He 
raises the razor and slits Brent across the face.

<b>                    BRENT
</b>               Jody run!

Jody crawls up the stairs, dragging her bad leg.

Instinctually, Brent hangs on to Leonard, as Leonard tries to get to Jody. 
Leonard slashes Brent across the face again.

<b>                      JODY
</b>               No!

<b>                      BRENT
</b>                   (dying)
              Run!

Jody crawls to the top of the stairs.  Leonard does everything he can to 
get away from Brent but Brent hangs on.  Jody watches, horrified, at the 
top of the stair. Kenny appears at the top of the stairs and pulls Jody 
away from the gruesome sight as Leonard continues to slash Brent's body 
open. Brent rolls over, a bloody mess.

<b>INT.  TOP OF STAIRS
</b>
Kenny slams the door shut as Leonard charges up the stairs. Kenny holds 
the door shut with all his might.

<b>                    JODY
</b>               My dad's down there!

<b>                     KENNY
</b>              He's dead! We've got to
              get the fuck out of here!

Kenny pushes a dresser in front of it, trapping Leonard.

<b>                     JODY
</b>              I can't walk. I think he cut right
              through a tendon.

Leonard starts chopping through the door with an axe.

Kenny helps Jody out the front door.

<b>EXT.  HOUSE
</b>
Jody and Kenny limp out of the house. Kenny grabs Jody's bike.

</b>             Go to the police station!

<b>                  KENNY
</b>             Deputy Webber's at the party.
             It's only three blocks away.

Leonard's car squeals around the corner behind them.

<b>                   JODY
</b>              Fuck! It's him.

<b>INT.  CAR
</b>
Leonard steps on the gas.

<b>EXT.  STREET
</b>
Kenny peddles as fast as he can, going up onto the sidewalk but that 
doesn't stop Leonard. He comes screeching up on the sidewalk right behind 
Kenny, ready to run him over.

Kenny tears up onto a lawn, Leonard follows him, grass spewing up 
everywhere.

Kenny cuts hard between two trees and back onto the street. He heads onto 
the other sidewalk. LEONARD remains in pursuit, knocking into several 
cars, flattening several fences, and mutilating a cat along the way.

Leonard gains on them as they zigzag up and down the pristine street, 
destroying it.

Leonard pulls up right behind them. He hits the gas. Kenny has to turn 
hard to avoid getting hit.

Kenny can't hold the bike upright and it slides out from under them.

Kenny and Jody tumble up someone's driveway, smashing into their fence.

Kenny helps Jody to her feet.

<b>BACK OF HOUSE

The GERMAN SHEPARD that lives in the house comes charging out of the dog 
door towards them, barking and snarling.

<b>                      KENNY
</b>                 Shit.

Kenny helps Jody over the fence, then leaps up on it just as the German 
Shepard snaps at
him.

He jumps down on the other side, safe.

The German Shepard smells something else and tears away.

<b>EXT.  FRONT OF HOUSE
</b>
Leonard gets out of his car and takes a step toward the house when the 
German Shepard comes charging out the open fence.  Leonard screams. The 
dog pounces on him, starts humping his leg. Leonard rolls his eyes. The 
dog thrusts away.

CLOSE ON THE RAZOR. Leonard raises the razor, contemplates, then rolls his 
eyes. He pushes the dog off of him.  It lets out a panted growl, almost 
like it's saying 'going so soon lover boy?' Leonard hops back in his car, 
speeds off down the street. The dog barks wildly up at the night sky. Talk 
about being left with a hard-on.

<b>EXT.  PARTY HOUSE
</b>
The house is dark. The lights are all out.

<b>EXT.   ROAD
</b>
The deputy checks his watch. A policeman comes running up.

<b>                     POLICEMAN
</b>                 We just found another body.

<b>                     DEPUTY
</b>                Who's?

<b>                     POLICEMAN
</b>                Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school.
                 Two kids went into his office to fuck and
                they found him, with his tongue cut out and
                his foot jammed into his mouth. Killer also
                chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his
                pencil holder.

<b>                    DEPUTY
</b>                 Jesus. Any word from Brent?

<b>                     POLICEMAN
</b>               Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown.
                Kids from other towns are starting to congregate
                in the parks and at the high school. It's turning
               into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.

<b>                    DEPUTY
</b>               Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What
                he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.

<b>                    POLICEMAN
</b>               Ok.

The deputy jumps into his car.

<b>                     DEPUTY
</b>                Don't leave this party until you
                hear from me.

The policeman looks up at the house.

<b>                     POLICEMAN
</b>               But I shouldn't shut it down?

<b>                     DEPUTY
</b>               No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn
               party I've ever seen.

<b>EXT.  SUBURBAN STREET
</b>
Jody and Kenny climb over a fence into another backyard. Jody is limping 
badly.
Kenny is helping her along.

<b>                     JODY
</b>               Thanks for coming back for me.

<b>                     KENNY

She kisses him. He kisses her back.

<b>INT.   CAR

Leonard has pulled over down the street from the party.

<b>EXT.   STREET

<b>INT.   POLICE CAR

The officer sits in his car, trying to call Brent.

<b>                      OFFICER
</b>                 Brent?
                     (no answer)
                 Come in Brent.

There's a knock at the car window. The officer looks up, startled.

<b>EXT.   CAR
</b>
Leonard is looking in the window.

<b>INT.   CAR
</b>
The officer rolls down the window.

<b>                       OFFICER
</b>                 Jesus Christ had balls in his soup,
                 Marliston, what'd you do, eat out a
                 pizza or something? What the fuck 
                 happened to your face?

<b>                       LEONARD
</b>                 Hey, look, Elvis.

<b>                       OFFICER
</b>                 Where?

<b>                       LEONARD
</b>                 You really are a god damn rube.

Leonard slashes the officer's throat open in one savage swoop. He slumps 
over the steering wheel, throat cut beyond repair, blood squirting 
everywhere.

<b>                       LEONARD
</b>                     (humming)
                'Family affair. Oh yes it's a 
                 family affair'.

<b>EXT.  PARTY
</b>
Jody and Kenny limp up to the party. There are no police outside.

<b>                        JODY
</b>                 Where are the police?

Jody looks down the road, lets out a blood curdling scream. LEONARD is 
slowly limping towards the house, gore dripping razor in hands.
<b>     
</b><b>                        JODY
</b>                 Oh GOD IT'S HIM!

<b>                        KENNY
</b>                 Quick! In the house. He
                 won't look for us in there.

Kenny and Jody limp toward the front door.

<b>INT.  PARTY HOUSE
</b>
Kenny and Jody limp through the front door. Couples are everywhere. 
There's no room
to even walk.

The party has reached it's 'climax'.

We see the faces of teenage boys and girls as they lose their virginity. 
They run the gamut of emotions. Some are terrified, some are ecstatic. 
Some are concentrating as hard as they've ever concentrated, some are 
closing their eyes, trying to fade out.

We see Sandy, Mark, Cindy, and Ben all having a blast. Sharon has managed 
to find a new partner and the nerds are riding the homely girls. It's 
orgiastic.

Kenny and Jody can only marvel at it as they limp through the maze of 
bodies looking for a place to hide.

KENNY GRABS  a sheet off the ground and carries Jody up the stairs.

<b>INT.  MASTER BEDROOM
</b>
Kenny carries Jody into the huge bedroom.

A couple of kids look up as the door opens. There must be over a 100 
teenagers in the room, adjoining bathroom, and closets. The room is just a 
sea of kids humping two deep, under blankets.

<b>                     KID ON FLOOR
</b>                 There's no room in here.
<b>     
</b><b>                     ANOTHER KID
</b>                 Yeah. Get lost we're packed.

Kenny pays no attention to them. He shoves his way into a corner,  pissing 
off everyone on the way, stepping on a few hands and other appendages. He 
puts Jody down and starts unbuttoning her shirt.

<b>                      JODY
</b>                    (whispering)
                 What are you doing?

<b>                      KENNY
</b>                 Pretend we're just another couple.

He pulls her under the sheet.

<b>INT.  PARTY - DOWNSTAIRS
</b>
Leonard comes in the front door, his razor in hand, the policeman's blood 
still dripping from it. He looks around, wondering if they're here.

No one seems to notice Leonard as he hunts for Jody and Kenny, walking 
through the sea of bodies, dripping blood on the backs of a couple of 
kids. A serial killer at a fuckfest.  Leonard smiles at the sight of all 
the teenagers copulating.

<b>INT.  MASTER BEDROOM
</b>
Kenny and Jody curl up next to each other. Kenny kisses her. She kisses 
him back.

They're into each other. They can't keep their hands off each other. They 
start to really make out.

<b>INT.   PARTY DOWNSTAIRS BEDROOM
</b>
Leonard moves into one of the bedrooms. He switches the lights on.

The kids look up pissed off. There's not an inch of floor space.

<b>                     BOY
</b>                Hey! Turn that off.

<b>                     GIRL
</b>                Mr. Marliston?!

<b>                     LEONARD
</b>                Hi Samantha. Excuse me.

He steps over a thrusting hairy ass, surveys the room.  No Kenny. No Jody.

<b>                     GIRL
</b>                    (freaked)
                What are you doing here?!

The girl breaks into orgasm before she can barely finish the sentence. 
Leonard
flips the lights off and heads out of the room. Through out the entire 
proceedings, everyone was fucking like no one entered the room. 
Homeostasis remains stable.

<b>INT.  PARTY STAIRCASE
</b>
Leonard heads up the stairs, still looking for Kenny and Jody. A couple of 
kids
on the staircase notice him. He almost trips on one. They start whispering 
to each other, freaked out that a teacher is there. More and more kids 
start looking up The party has definitely been disturbed.

<b>INT.   MASTER BEDROOM
</b>
Jody hears the disturbance. She stops Kenny and listens.

<b>INT.   BEDROOM
</b>
Leonard checks another bedroom. He flips the lights on. No Jody, no Kenny. 
He leaves. More and more kids notice him.

<b>INT.   MASTER BEDROOM
</b>
Jody and Kenny know he's close. Leonard appears in the doorway.

<b>                      KENNY
</b>                    (whispering)
                  It's him.

Leonard accidentally steps on a boy's hand as he enters the room. The boy, 
JIMMY, is pissed off.  He looks up and realizes who it is.

<b>                      LEONARD
</b>                 Pay no attention to me.

<b>                      JIMMY
</b>                 What are you doing here?

<b>                      BOY ACROSS THE ROOM
</b>                 He's looking to get laid.

<b>                      JIMMY'S GIRLFRIEND
</b>                Mr. Marliston?

She grabs her clothes, embarrassed. Jimmy gets up. He's very drunk. Kenny 
and Jody peek out from under their sheet.

<b>                       JIMMY
</b>                 You fucked me up!

<b>                       LEONARD
</b>                 What?

<b>                       JIMMY
</b>                 You gave me a 'D'.

<b>                       LEONARD
</b>                 I'm sure you should have failed.

<b>                       JIMMY
</b>                 I was grounded for two fucking
                 months because of you!

Jody knows her friend is in danger.

<b>                       JODY
</b>                 Jimmy leave him alone! He's
                 imbalanced.

Leonard sees Jody. He starts toward her but Jimmy stupidly jumps in his 
way.

<b>                      LEONARD
</b>                 Please get out of my way
                 or I'll have to hurt you.

<b>                      JIMMY
</b>                 I knew you were a pervert.
                 Always wearing those fucking doofy     
                 glasses, and driving a station wagon.

<b>                      JODY
</b>                 He's dangerous Jimmy!

<b>                      JIMMY
</b>                 So am I! I'm gonna rip your cock off
                  Marliston!

<b>                      LEONARD
</b>                 Touché'

Leonard winds back, slashes at Jimmy, lopping off his dick. Blood flies 
up, splatters across Jimmy's face. Jimmy screams. Leonard slashes open his 
neck. Blood splatters everywhere, on kid's backs, faces, butts.

His girlfriend screams as Jimmy falls to the ground, dying.

Leonard begins to panic. So do the kids. Leonard sees Jody across the room 
and starts toward her as the other kids in the room rise to their feet and 
stampede the fuck out of dodge like a herd of frightened elephants.

<b>INT.  DIFFERENT BEDROOM
</b>
Kids in other rooms hear the commotion and break their embraces.

<b>                    BOY(O.C.)
</b>                Run! Mr. Marliston's here!
                And he's horny!

Panic sweeps through the whole party. Everyone wants out.

Leonard can't get to Jody because too many kids are trying to get out the 
bedroom door, pushing toward it, sweeping him up in their flow. It has 
turned quickly into chaos with a teenage logjam at the door.

Leonard keeps his eyes pinned on Jody across the room, through the bodies. 
He can't make headway so he raises the razor to slash way to her. Jody 
sees him raise the razor.

<b>                     JODY
</b>                 No!

Leonard starts slashing his way toward Jody. He slashes a girl across the 
stomach, a boy across the face, a  girl across the breasts. It's a 
bloodbath, everyone's screaming.

KIDS' bodies fall to the ground, tripping people, creating even more 
chaos.

Leonard loses his balance and is pushed to the ground as kids stampede 
over him.

<b>INT.  MASTER BEDROOM
</b>
Jody and Kenny try to make it to the door.

Leonard tries to get up but he can't. He starts crawling toward Jody, 
slashing the legs of a couple of kids who are in his way, sending them to 
the ground. One kid does a back flip through a glass coffee table, 
exploding it, sending a shard of glass out his throat. Blood sprays across 
the ceiling like a lawn sprinkler.

Through the sea of legs, Leonard sees Jody's leg, the 'VIR' still freshly 
carved. He slashes his way towards Jody.

<b>EXT.   HOUSE
</b>
Half naked kids come streaming out of the house, it's a bizarre sight. 
Some of them stop and scream, noticing the deputy (his body has been hung 
upside down from a telephone pole, and disemboweled). The house is almost 
bursting as kids climb out the windows and appear from the back.

<b>INT.   STAIRWELL
</b>
Too many kids are trying to get out at one. The staircase and all the 
hallways start totally backed up but all the kids keep pushing forward. 
Something's got to give.

<b>INT.   BEDROOM
</b>
Leonard keeps crawling toward Jody, getting closer and closer. He 
scrunches over Jimmy's severed penis, staining his khakis with gore.

<b>                      LEONARD
</b>                 Come on! These are eighty dollar
                 INDEPENDENT khakis! Limited Edition!     
                 God damn it!

<b>INT.   STAIRWELL
</b>
The pushing continues. There's nowhere to go. A boy gets pushed over the 
balcony, falling to the ground below.

<b>INT.   BEDROOM
</b>
Leonard is just a few feet from Jody's leg.

Jody and Kenny push closer to the door.

Leonard reaches for Jody's leg. He can't quite grab it.

Kenny and Jody reach the door. They're almost out. Leonard lungs and grabs
Jody's leg.

Jody screams out in pain, falls into the crowd.

<b>                      JODY
</b>                   Kenny!

Kenny tries to grab for her but he can't reach her. The force of the mob 
pushes him out the door, through the vortex.

<b>INT.  UPSTAIRS
</b>
Kids jam the staircase. There's too many trying to get down at once. 
Everyone's
still pushing. The kids on the staircase can't keep their position and 
start falling forward, pushing harder.

<b>INT.  BEDROOM
</b>
Leonard keeps hold of Jody's leg and pulls her toward him.

<b>EXT.  BALCONEY
</b>
Kenny tries to get back to Jody but there's no way he can make headway 
back into that room.

<b>                       KENNY
</b>                    Jody?!

The staircase is now jammed with people, starts to buckle.

The banister breaks. Kids start falling off the balcony and staircase, 
onto kids below, CRACKING SKULLS, breaking bones.

<b>INT.   DOWNSTAIRS
</b>
Lamps smash to the ground. Tables are trampled. Basically, the entire 
inside of the house is destroyed in the stampede which puts something out 
of fucking JUMANJI to shame.

<b>INT.   BEDROOM
</b>
Leonard gets hold of Jody's waist and pulls her towards him, razor ready.

<b>INT.   UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR
</b>
Everyone gives one final push out. Kenny is swept on to the staircase. It 
can't take the pressure and finally cracks.

Kids tumble on top of each other falling to the floor below as the 
staircase splinters. Hurt kids are everywhere as more and more get pushed 
over the edge. It's a disaster. Broken boned teenagers litter the floor 
like it were a battlefield.

Kenny manages to grab hold of the second floor as kids fall past him.

The whole house begins to buckle.

<b>INT.   BEDROOM
</b>
The room empties as the kids push out. Leonard pulls Jody up next to him 
and puts the razor to her neck. He draws the first spot of blood.

<b>                      JODY
</b>                Please! You wouldn't kill your
                sister, would you?

<b>                     LEONARD
</b>                You think you're my sister?

<b>INT.   STAIRCASE
</b>
Kenny manages to pull himself back up to the second floor.

<b>INT.   BEDROOM
</b>
Jody turns to look at LEONARD as Kenny appears in the doorway.

<b>                      JODY
</b>                 We have the same color eyes.

He looks into her eyes.

<b>                      LEONARD
</b>                 You're right. We do.

Leonard stares at Jody for a moment, relaxing his grip, giving Kenny just 
the break he needs to dive for Leonard's arm, surprising him, knocking him 
over. They struggle for the razor but Leonard overpowers him and grabs it, 
cutting his own hand. He turns and slices Kenny down the side, cutting him 
deep.

Kenny fights off the pain and leaps on Leonard's back, grabbing his arm 
around the neck.

Leonard stands up and twirls around, trying to knock Kenny off his back, 
smashing him into walls.

Kenny screams in pain, but doesn't let go, pulling at Leonard's face and 
throat.

Leonard spins faster.

JODY struggles to her feet, holding her neck, still losing a little blood. 
Kenny's grips start to slip as Leonard reaches back, to slice him across 
the face and neck.

LEONARD, backs up towards the window, slips over a dildo. He screams, 
loses his grip on Kenny, goes crashing out the second story window.

<b>EXT.  HOUSE
</b>
Leonard crashes to the ground below, landing on his back on the front 
steps.

<b>INT.  BEDROOM
</b>
Jody looks out after him. He looks up to her. Their eyes meet.

<b>EXT.  HOUSE
</b>
KIDS start circling Leonard.

Leonard gets to his knees, still holding the razor. They start taunting 
him.

<b>                    BOY 1
</b>                It's the freak!

The kids inch closer to Leonard.
<b>          
</b><b>                    GIRL 1
</b>                He's still got the blade!

One kid kicks him. Leonard slashes at the kid, but misses. Another boy 
kicks the knife out of his hands. A third picks it up.

<b>                    BOY 3
</b>                Come on! It's fuck him up time!

One boy kicks Leonard in the face. Another kicks him in the ribs, another 
in the balls. Leonard tries to fight back for a second but slowly they all 
descend on him, taking turns kicking and beating the ever living shit out 
of him. It's a feeding frenzy.  He disappears under the angry mob of 
teenagers.

<b>INT.  BEDROOM
</b>
Jody helps Kenny to his feet.

<b>                     KENNY
</b>                Come on. Lets get out of here.

<b>EXT.  FRONT YARD
</b>
Police cars screech to a stop out front. The kids are all disappearing off 
down the street.

JODY AND KENNY emerge out the front door, look down at LEONARD, barely 
alive, lying at bloody mess at the base of the steps.
<b>     
</b><b>                      LEONARD
</b>                J-Jody. P-please help me.
                Please.

Leonard spits up blood. Jody squeals. Kenny covers her eyes.

CLOSE on the BALCONY overhead. The railing breaks off and the balcony 
comes crashing down, falling on Leonard, killing him. Jody embraces Kenny 
tightly.

<b>                      KENNY
</b>                It's all over now.

dissolve to:

<b>EXT.  AVON LAKE CEMETERY
</b>
Cemetery- Brent's coffin is in a grave. People are leaving the funeral.

Jody is with her Mom. They are the last ones there. They watch as the 
workers start to throw dirt on the coffin.

Jody takes her mom's hand in her own. They're close again.

Dissolve to:

<b>INT.  JODY'S BEDROOM -  A MONTH LATER
</b>
It's night. Jody is asleep.

<b>EXT.  BEDROOM
</b>
Someone is in the shadows outside, climbing up to her bedroom window.

<b>INT.  BEDROOM
</b>
Intruder's POV - Through the window, Jody is sound asleep in her bed, 
vulnerable.

The window opens. Someone steps in and moves quietly over to the edge of 
the bed. She wakes, startled. She looks up. IT'S KENNY.

<b>                     KENNY
</b>                  (smiling)
               I'm all out of patience.

He climbs in her bed and takes her. She lets him. She's into it.

A pair of eyes peer through the slates of Jody's closet door. Someone is 
hidden in her closet.

KILLER'S POV - Jody and Kenny are now in the middle of making love for the 
first time. It's getting hot.

<b>                     JODY
</b>               Oh God, this is the way it
               should be.

The closet door opens. The real LISA SHERMAN is there. Maybe she wasn't 
dead after all!

She starts toward Jody, raising a huge butcher knife over her head.

Jody sees her and screams.

The knife comes down toward the center of Kenny's back.

His face contorts as the knife enters his body. Jody screams as he coughs 
up blood all over her breasts.

He looks helplessly at Jody, dying as the knife comes down again.

But now it's her father who's doing the stabbing!

<b>INT.  JODY'S BEDROOM 
</b>
Jody wakes up from her dream, startled and shaken. She looks next to 
herself in bed. Kenny is lying there asleep, smiling, probably dreaming of 
her. The window is open. He must have climbed in.

There is a little red spot on the sheet next to her.

She cuddles up next to him as the sun starts to rise outside.

Dissolve to:

<b>EXT.  CHERRY FALLS
</b>
The entrance to the town. The hanging sign reads 'Entering Cherry Falls, 
Ohio'.

The beautiful town is now peaceful again. The crickets are chirping, the 
robins begin cooing. Suddenly a window comes up and the hanging sign 
begins to sway back and forth, almost on its own.
