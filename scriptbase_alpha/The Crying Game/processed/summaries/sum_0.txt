An unlikely kind of friendship develops between Fergus, an Irish Republican Army volunteer, and Jody, a kidnapped British soldier lured into an IRA trap by Jude, another IRA member.
When the hostage-taking ends up going horribly wrong, Fergus escapes and heads to London, where he seeks out Jody's lover, a hairdresser named Dil.
Fergus adopts the name "Jimmy" and gets a job as a day laborer.
He also starts seeing Dil, who knows nothing about Fergus' IRA background.
But there are some things about Dil that Fergus doesn't know, either...
