In 1980, on the night he fails to win an Emmy Award, Matt Hobbs proposes to his longtime girlfriend Beth.
He says the only thing holding him back is his dedication to his career, one which may not always work out, and Beth says that's one of the things she loves most about him.
Little more than a year later, with a baby crying and no job for Matt, Beth is overflowing with resentment.
By 1993, the pair have been divorced for several years and are living on opposite coasts.
Matt auditions for a role in pompous, self-absorbed, and clueless film producer Burke Adler's new project but fails to get the part.
He does however agree to chauffeur Adler occasionally.
Matt flies to Georgia to pick up his daughter Jeannie for what he believes is a brief visit and discovers Beth is facing a prison term and Jeannie will be living with him for the duration of her sentence.
The two return to Hollywood and struggle with their new circumstances and building a relationship (Matt hasn't seen the six-year-old since she was four).
When Matt goes in to make a screen test for a lead in a film, he leaves Jeannie with a friend at the studio, and when he picks her up he's stunned to learn she's been cast in a sitcom.
There are multiple sub-plots, including one focusing on Matt's relationship with staff script-reader Cathy Breslow and another concerning test screening analyst Nan Mulhanney and her tumultuous relationship with Adler.
While a large part of the film is a satire of the film industry, it also skewers relationships from various angles.
